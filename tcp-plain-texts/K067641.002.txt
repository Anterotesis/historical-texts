ChurchYard  THE LIVES OF THE POETS  ANTHONY BREWER  _A POET who flourished in the reign of Charles I but of whose birth and life we can recover no particulars He was highly esteemed by some wits in that reign as appears from a Poem called Steps to Parnassus which pays him the following well turned compliment  Let Brewer take his artful pen in hand  Attending muses will obey command  Invoke the aid of Shakespear's sleeping clay  And strike from utter darkness new born day  Mr Winstanley and after him Chetwood has attributed a play to our author called Lingua or the Contention of the Tongue and the Five Senses for Superiority a Comedy acted at Cambridge but Mr Langbaine is of opinion that neither that Love's Loadstone Landagartha or Love's Dominion as Winstanley and Philips affirm are his Landagartha being written by Henry Burnel esquire and Love's Dominion by Flecknoe In the Comedy called Lingua there is a circumstance which Chetwood mentions too curious to be omitted here When this play was acted at Cambridge Oliver Cromwel performed the part of Tactus which he felt so warmly that it first fired his ambition and from the possession of an imaginary crown he stretched his views to a real one to accomplish which he was content to wade through a sea of blood and as Mr Gray beautifully expresses it shut the Gates of Mercy on Mankind the speech with which he is said to have been so affected is the following  Roses and bays pack hence this crown and robe  My brows and body circles and invests  How gallantly it fits me sure the slave  Measured my head that wrought this coronet  They lie that say complexions cannot change  My blood's enobled and I am transform'd  Unto the sacred temper of a king  Methinks I hear my noble Parasites  Stiling me Caesar or great Alexander  Licking my feetc  Mr Langbaine ascribes to Brewer the two following plays  Country Girl a Comedy often acted with applause printed in to This play has been revived since the Restoration under the title of Country Innocence or the Chambermaid turned Quaker  Lovesick King an English Tragical History with the Life and Death of Cartesmunda the Fair Nun of Winchester printed in to London this play was likewise revived and acted by the name of the Perjured Nun The historical part of the plot is founded upon the Invasion of the Danes in the reign of King Ethelred and Alfred  This last play of Anthony Brewer's is one of the best irregular plays next to those of Shakespear which are in our language The story which is extremely interesting is conducted not so much with art as spirit the characters are animated and the scene busy Canutus King of Denmark after having gained the city of Winchester by the villainy of a native orders all to be put to the sword and at last enters the Cloister raging with the thirst of blood and panting for destruction he meets Cartesmunda whose beauty stops his ruffian violence and melts him as it were into a human creature The language of this play is as modern and the verses as musical as those of Rowe fire and elevation run through it and there are many strokes of the most melting tenderness Cartesmunda the Fair Nun of Winchester inspires the King with a passion for her and after a long struggle between honour and love she at last yields to the tyrant and for the sake of Canutus breaks her vestal vows Upon hearing that the enemy was about to enter the  Cloister Cartesmunda breaks out into the following beautiful exclamation  The raging foe pursues defend us Heaven  Take virgin tears the balm of martyr'd saints  As tribute due to thy tribunal throne  With thy right hand keep us from rage and murder  Let not our danger fright us but our sins  Misfortunes touch our bodies not our souls  When Canutus advances and first sees Cartesmunda his speech is poetical and conceived in the true spirit of Tragedy  Ha who holds my conquering hand what power unknown  By magic thus transforms me to a statue  Senseless of all the faculties of life  My blood runs back I have no power to strike  Call in our guards and bid 'em all give o'er  Sheath up your swords with me and cease to kill  Her angel beauty cries she must not die  Nor live but mine O I am strangely touch'd  Methinks I lift my sword against myself  When I oppose herall perfection  O see the pearled dew drops from her eyes  Arise in peace sweet soul  In the same scene the following is extremely beautiful  I'm struck with light'ning from the torrid zone  Stand all between me and that flaming sun  Go Erkinwald convey her to my tent  Let her be guarded with more watchful eyes  Than heaven has stars  If here she stay I shall consume to death  'Tis time can give my passions remedy  Art thou not gone kill him that gazeth on her  For all that see her sure must doat like me  And treason for her will be wrought against us  Be suddento our tentspray thee away  The hell on earth is love that brings delay  THOMAS MAY  A POET and historian of the th century was descended of an ancient but decayed family in the county of Sussex in the reign of Queen Elizabeth  Langbaine's Lives of the Poets  and was educated a fellow commoner in Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge He afterwards removed to London and lived about the court where he contracted friendships with several gentlemen of fashion and distinction especially with Endymion Portér esquire one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to King Charles I while he resided at court he wrote five plays which are extant under his name In he published at London in vo a translation of Virgil's Georgics with annotations and in a Poem on King Edward III It was printed under the title of the Victorious Reign of Edward III written in seven books by his Majesty's command In the dedication to Charles I our author writes thus  "I should humbly have craved your Majesty's pardon for my omission of the latter part of King Edward's reign but that the sense of mine own defects hath put me in mind of a most necessary suit so beg forgiveness for that part which is here written Those great actions of Edward III are the arguments of this poem which is here  ended where his fortune began to decline where the French by revolts and private practices regained that which had been won from them by eminent and famous victories which times may afford fitter observations for an acute historian in prose than strains of heighth for an heroic poem"  The poem thus begins  The third and greatest Edward's reign we sing  The high atchievements of that martial King  Where long successful prowesse did advance  So many trophies in triumphed France  And first her golden lillies bare who o're  Pyrennes mountains to that western shore  Where Tagus tumbles through his yellow sand  Into the ocean stretch'd his conquering hand  From the lines quoted the reader will be able to judge what sort of versisier our author was and from this beginning he has no great reason to expect an entertaining poem especially as it is of the historical kind and he who begins a poem thus insipidly can never expect his readers to accompany him to the third page May likewise translated Lucan's Pharsalia which poem he continued down to the death of Julius Caesar both in Latin and English verse  Dr Fuller says that some disgust was given to him at court which alienated his affections from it and determined him in the civil wars to adhere to the Parliament  Mr Philips in his Theatrum Poetarum observes that he stood candidate with Sir William Davenant for the Laurel and his ambition being frustrated he conceived the most violent aversion to the King and Queen Sir William Davenant besides the acknowledged superiority of his abilities had ever distinguished himself for loyalty and was patronized and favoured by men of power especially the Marquis of Newcastle a circumstance which  we find not to have happened to May it is true they were both the friends of the amiable Endymion Porter  esq  but we are not informed whether that gentleman interested himself on either side  In the year was published in London in folio The History of the Parliament of England which began November with a Short and Necessary View of some precedent Years written by Thomas May  Esq  Secretary to the Parliament and published by their authority In he published in vo A Breviary of the History of the Parliament of England Besides these works Mr Philips tells us he wrote a History of Henry IV in English verse the Comedy of the Old Wives Tale and the History of Orlando Furioso but the latter Mr Langbaine who is a higher authority than Philips assures us was written before May was able to hold a pen much less to write a play being printed in London Mr Winstanley says that in his history he shews all the spleen of a malcontent and had he been preferred to the Bays as he happened to be disappointed he would have embraced the Royal interest with as much zeal as he did the republican for a man who espouses a cause from spite only can be depended upon by no party because he acts n  t upon any principles of honour or conviction  Our author died suddenly in the year and was interred near the tomb of Camden on the West side of the North isle of Westminster Abbey but his body with several others was dug up after the restoration and buried in a pit in St Margaret's church yard  Wood's Fasti Oxon vol i p  Mr May's plays are  Agrippina Empress of Rome a Tragedy printed in mo London Our author has  followed Suetonius and Tacitus and has translated and inserted above lines from Petronius Arbiter this circumstance we advance on the authority of Langbaine whose extensive reading has furnished him with the means of tracing the plots of most part of our English plays we have heard that there is a Tragedy on this subject written by Mr Gray of Cambridge the author of the beautiful Elegy in a Country Church Yard which play Mr Garrick has sollicited him to bring upon the stage to which the author has not yet consented  Antigone the Theban Princess a Tragedy printed in vo London and dedicated to Endymion Porter  Esq  Our author in the contexture of this Tragedy has made use of the Antigone of Sophocles and the Thebais of Seneca  Cleopatra Queen of Egypt a Tragedy acted and printed in mo London and dedicated to Sir Kenelme Digby The author has followed the historians of those times We have in our language two other plays upon the same subject one by Shakespear and the other by Dryden  Heir a Comedy acted by the company of revels this play is much commended by Mr Thomas Carew in a copy of verses prefixed to the play where amongst other commendations bestowed on the stile and natural working up of the passions he says thus of the oeconomy of the play  The whole plot doth alike itself disclose  Thro' the five Acts as doth a lock that goes  With letters for 'till every one be known  The lock's as fast as if you had found none  If this comedy is no better than these wretched commendatory lines it is miserable indeed  Old Couple a Comedy printed in to this play is intended to expose the vice of covetousness  JOHN TAYLOUR WaterPoet  WAS born in Gloucestershire where he went to school with one Green and having got into his accidence was bound apprentice to a Waterman in London which though a laborious employment did not so much depress his mind but that he sometimes indulged himself in poetry Taylour retates a whimsical story of his schoolmaster Mr Green which we shall here insert upon the authority of Winstanley  "Green loved new milk so well that in order to have it new he went to the market to buy a cow but his eyes being dim he cheapened a bull and asking the price of the beast the owner and he agreed and driving it home would have his maid to milk it which she attempting to do could find no teats and whilst the maid and her master were arguing the matter the bull very fairly pissed into the pail"  whereupon his scholar John Taylour wrote these verses  Our master Green was overseen  In buying of a bull  For when the maid did mean to milk  He piss'd the pail half full  Our Waterpoet found leisure to write fourscore books some of which occasioned diversion enough in their time and were thought worthy to be collected in a folio volume Mr Wood observes that had he had learning equal to his natural genius which was excellent he might have equalled if not excelled many who claim a great share in the temple of the muses Upon breaking out of the rebellion he left London and retired to Oxford where he was much esteemed for his facetious company he kept a common victualling house there and thought he did great service to the Royal cause by writing Pasquils against the roundheads After the garrison of Oxford surrendered he retired to Westminster kept a public house in Phaenix Alley near Long Acre and continued constant in his loyalty to the King after whose death he setup a sign over his door of a mourning crown but that proving offensive he pulled it down and hung up his own picture  Athen Oxon vol ii p  under which were these words  There's many a head stands for a sign  Then gentle reader why not mine  On the other side  Tho' I deserve not I desire  The laurel wreath the poet's hire  He died in the year aged and was buried in the church yard of St Paul's CoventGarden his nephew a Painter at Oxford who lived in Wood's time informed him of this circumstance who gave his picture to the school gallery there where it now hangs shewing  him to have had a quick and smart countenance The following epitaph was written upon him  Here lies the Waterpoet honest John  Who row'd on the streams of Helicon  Where having many rocks and dangers past  He at the haven of Heaven arrived at last  WILLIAM HABINGTON  SON of Thomas Habington  Esq  was born at Hendlip in Worcestershire on the th of November and received his education at St Omers and Paris where he was earnestly pressed to take upon him the habit of a Jesuit but that sort of life not suiting with his genius he excused himself and left them  Wood Athen Oxon v p  After his return from Paris he was instructed by his father in history and other useful branches of literature and became says Wood a very accomplished gentleman This author has written  Poems in vo under the title of Castara they are divided into three parts under different titles suitable to their subject The first which was written when he was courting his wife Lucia the beautiful daughter of William Lord Powis is introduced by a character written in prose of a mistress The second are copies to her after marriage by the character of a wife after which is a character of a friend before several funeral elegies The third part consists of divine poems some of which are paraphrases on several texts out of Job and the book of psalms  The Queen of Arragon a TragiComedy which play he shewed to Philip Earl of Pembroke who having a high opinion of it caused it to be acted at court and afterwards to be published the contrary to the author's inclination  Observations on History Lond vo  History of Edward IV Lond in a thin folio written and published at the desire of King Charles I which in the opinion of some critics of that age was too florid for history and fell short of that calm dignity which is peculiar to a good historian and which in our nation has never been more happily attained than by the great Earl of Clarendon and Bishop Burnet During the civil war Mr Habington according to Wood temporized with those in power and was not unknown to Oliver Cromwell but there is no account of his being raised to any preferment during the Protector's government He died the th of November  We shall present the readers with the prologue to the Queen of Arragon acted at BlackFryars as a specimen of this author's poetry  Ere we begin that no man may repent  Two shillings and his time the author sent  The prologue with the errors of his play  That who will may take his money and away  First for the plot 'tis no way intricate  By cross deceits in love nor so high in state  That we might have given out in our playbill  This day's the Prince writ by Nick Machiavil  The language too is easy such as fell  Unstudied from his pen not like a spell  Big with mysterious words such as inchant  The halfwitted and confound the ignorant  Then what must needs afflict the amourist  No virgin here in breeches casts a mist  Before her lover's eyes no ladies tell  How their blood boils how high their veins do swell  But what is worse no baudy mirth is here  The wit of bottleale and double beer  To make the wife of citizen protest  And country justice swear 'twas a good jest  Now Sirs you have the errors of his wit  Like or dislike at your own perils be't  FRANCIS GOLDSMITH  WAS the son of Francis Goldsmith of St Giles in the Fields in Middlesex  Esq  was educated under Dr Nicholas Grey in MerchantTaylor's School became a gentleman commoner in PembrokeCollege in the beginning of was soon after translated to St John's College and after he had taken a degree in arts to Grey'sInn where he studied the common law several years but other learning more  Wood Athen Oxon v p  Mr Langbaine says that he could recover no other memoirs of this gentleman but that he lived in the reign of King Charles the First and obliged the World with a translation of a play out of Latin called  Sophompaneas or the History of Joseph with Annotations a Tragedy printed to Lond and dedicated to the Right Hon Henry Lord Marquis of Dorchester This Drama was written by the admirable Hugo Grotius published by him at Amsterdam and dedicated to Vossius Professor of History and Civil Arts in  Amsterdam He stiles it a Tragedy notwithstanding it ends successfully and quotes for his authority in so doing Aesch  lus Euripides and even Vossius in his own Art of Poetry Some make it a Question whether it be lawful to found a dramatic Poem on any sacred subject and some people of tender consciences have murmured against this Play and another of the same cast called Christ's Passion but let us hear the opinion of Vossius himself prefixed to this Play  "I am of opinion says he it is better to chuse another argument than sacred For it agrees not with the majesty of sacred things to be made a play and a fable It is also a work of very dangerous consequence to mingle human inventions with things sacred because the poet adds uncertainties of his own sometimes falsities which is not only to play with holy things but also to graft in men's minds opinions now and then false These things have place especially when we bring in God or Christ speaking or treating of the mysteries of religion I will allow more where the history is taken out of the sacred scriptures but yet in the nature of the argument is civil as the action of David flying from his son Absolom or of Joseph sold by his brethren advanced by Pharaoh to the government of Egypt and that dignity adored by and made known unto his brethren Of which argument is Sophompaneas written by Hugo Grotius embassador from the Queen of Sweden to the King of France which tragedy I suppose may be set for a pattern to him that would handle an argument from the holy scriptures"  This is the opinion of Vossius and with him all must agree who admire the truly admirable Samson Agonistes of Milton  As we have frequently mentioned Grotius the short account of so great a man which is inserted in Langbaine will not be unpleasing to the reader  "Hugo Grotius says he was an honour to his country he was born in the year and will be famous to posterity in regard of those many excellent pieces he has published In some of his writings he desended Arminianism for which he suffered imprisonment in the castle of Louverstein in the year at which time his associate Barnevelt lost his head on the same account Afterwards Grotius escaped out of prison by means of Maria Reigersberg his wife and fled into Flanders and thence into France where he was kindly received by Lewis XIII He died at Rostock in Mecclebourg Sept His life is written at large by Melchoir Adamus in Latin"  As to our outhor's translation which is in heroic verse it is much commended by verses from four of his friends  He also translated Grotius's consolatory oration to his father with epitaphs and also his Catechism into English verse  Mr Goldsmith died at Ashton in Northamptonshire in September and was buried there leaving behind him an only daughter named Katherine afterwards the wife of Sir Henry Dacres  JOHN CLEVELAND  WAS the son of a vicar of Hinkley in Leicestershire where he was born and received his grammatical education under one Mr Richard Vines a zealous Puritan After he had compleated his school education he was sent to Christ'sCollege in Cambridge and in a short time distinguishing himself for his knowledge of the Latin tongue and for Oratory he was preferred to a fellowship in St John'sCollege in the said university He continued there about nine years and made during that time some successful attempts in poetry At length upon the eruption of the civil war he was the first who espoused the Royal cause in verse against the Presbyterians who persecuted him in their turn with more solid severity for he was ejected ar soon as the reins of power were in their hands Dr Fuller bestows upon our author the most lavish panegyric He was says he a general artist pure latinist an exquisite orator and what was his masterpiece an eminent poet Dr Fuller thus characterizes him but as Cleveland has not left remains behind him sufficient to convey to posterity so high an idea of his merit it may be supposed that the Doctor spoke thus in his favour meerly on account of their agreement in political principles He addressed an oration says Winstanley to Charles I who was so well pleased with it that he sent for him and gave him his hand to kiss with great expressions of kindness When Oliver Cromwell  Wood fasti Oxon p  was in election to be member for the town of Cambridge as he engaged all his friends and interests to oppose it so when it was carried but by one vote he cried out with much passion that that single vote had ruined church and kingdom  Winst Lives of the Poets  such fatal events did he presage from the success of Oliver Mr Cleveland was no sooner forced from the College by the prevalence of the Parliament's interest but he betook himself to the camp and particularly to Oxford the head quarters of it as the most proper sphere for his wit learning and loyalty Here he began a paper war with the opposite party and wrote some smart satires against the Rebels especially the Scots His poem called the Mixt Assembly his character of a London Diurnal and a Committeeman are thought to contain the true spirit of satire and a just representation of the general confusion of the times From Oxford he went to the garrison of Newark where he acted as judge advocate till that garrison was surrendered and by an excellent temperature of both says Winstanley he was a just and prudent judge for the King and a faithful advocate for the Country  Here he drew up a bantering answer and rejoinder to a Parliament officer who had written to him on account of one Hill that had deserted their side and carried off with him to Newark the sum of l and d We shall give part of Mr Cleveland's answer to the officer's first letter by which an estimate may be formed of the rest  SIXTHLY BELOVED  "It is so that our brother and fellowlabourer in the gospel is start aside then this may serve for an use of instruction not to trust in man or in the son of man Did  not Demas leave Paul Did not Onesimus run from his master Philemon Also this should teach us to employ our talents and not to lay them up in a napkin had it been done among the cavaliers it had been just then the Israelite had spoiled the Egyptian but for Simeon to plunder Levi thatthat c"  The garrison of Newark defended themselves with much courage and resolution against the besiegers and did not surrender but by the King's special command after he had thrown himself into the hands of the Scots which action of his Majesty's Cleveland passionately resented in his poem called the King's Disguise Upon some private intelligence three days before the King reached them he foresaw that the army would be bribed to surrender him in which he was not mistaken As soon as this event took place Cleveland who warmly adhered to the regal party was obliged to atone for his loyalty by languishing in a jail at Yarmouth where he remained for some time under all the disadvantages of poverty and wretchedness At last being quite spent with the severity of his confinement he addressed Oliver Cromwell in a petition for liberty in such pathetic and moving terms that his heart was melted with the prisoner's expostulation and he ordered him to be set at liberty In this address our author did not in the least violate his loyalty for he made no concessions to Oliver but only a represen  ation of the hardships he suffered without acknowledging his sovereignty tho' not without flattering his power Having thus obtained his liberty he settled himself in Gray'sInn and as he owed his releasement to the Protector he thought it his duty to be passive and not at least to act against him But Cleveland did not long enjoy his state of unenvied ease for he was seized with an intermitting f  ver and died the th of April  Winst Lives of the Poets  On the first of May he was buried and his dear friend Dr John Pearson afterwards lord bishop of Chester preached his funeral sermon and gave this reason why he declined commending the deceased  "because such praising of him would not be adequate to the expectation of the audience seeing some who knew him must think it far below him"  There were many who attempted to write elegies upon him and several performances of this kind in Latin and English are prefixed to the edition of Cleveland's works in verse and prose printed in vo in with his effigies prefixed  From the verses of his called Smectymnuus we shall give the following specimen in which the reader will see he did not much excel in numbers  Smectymnuus the goblin makes me start  I'th' name of RabbiAbraham what art  Syriack or Arabick or Welsh what skilt  Up all the bricklayers that Babel built  Some conjurer translate and let me know it  'Till then 'tis fit for a West Saxon Poet  But do the brotherhood then play their prizes  Like murmurs in religion with disguises  Outbrave us with a name in rank and file  A name which if 'twere trained would spread a mile  The Saints monopoly the zealous cluster  Which like a porcupine presents a muster  The following lines from the author's celebrated satire entitled the RebelScot will yet more amply shew his turn for this species of poetry  " Nature herself doth Scotchmen beasts confess  " Making their country such a wilderness  " A land that brings in question and suspence  " God's omnipresence but that CHARLES came thence  " But that MONTROSE and CRAWFORD's loyal band  " Aton'd their sin and christen'd half their land  " A land where one may pray with curst intent  " O may they never suffer banishment  " Had Cain been Scot God would have chang'd his doom  " Not forc'd him wander but confin'd him home  " Lord what a goodly thing is want of shirts  " How a Scotch stomach and no meat converts  " They wanted food and rayment so they took  " Religion for their sempstress and their cook  " Hence then you proud impostors get you gone  " You Picts in gentry and devotion  " You scandal to the stock of verse a race  " Able to bring the gibbet in disgrace  " The Indian that heaven did forswear  " Because he heard some Spaniards were there  " Had he but known what Scots in Hell had been  " He would Erasmuslike have hung between"  It is probable that this bitterness against our brethren of NorthBritain chiefly sprang from Mr Cleveland's resentment of the Scots Army delivering up the King to the Parliament  Dr BARTEN HOLYDAY  SON of Thomas Holyday a taylor was born at All Saints parish within the city of Oxford about the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign he was entered early into Christ Church in the time of Dr  avis his relation and patron by  whom he was chosen student and having taken his degrees of batchelor and master of arts he became archdeacon of Oxfordshire In he entered into holy orders  Athen Oxon Ed  and was in a short time taken notice of as an eloquent or rather popular preacher by which he had two benefices confered on him both in the diocese of Oxford  In the year he went as chaplain to Sir Francis Stewart when he accompanied to Spain the Count Gundamore after he had continued several Years at our court as embassador in which journey Holyday behaved in a facetious and pleasant manner which ingratiated him in the favour of Gundamore  Wood ubi supra  Afterwards our author became chaplain to King Charles I and succeeded Dr Bridges in the archdeaconry of Oxon before the year In he was by virtue of the letters of the said King created with several others Dr of divinity When the rebellion broke out he sheltered himself near Oxford but when he saw the royal party decline so much that their cause was desperate he began to tamper with the prevailing power and upon Oliver Cromwell's being raised to the Protectorship he so far coincided with the Usurper's interests as to undergo the examination of the Friers in order to be inducted into the rectory of Shilton in Berks in the place of one Thomas Lawrence ejected on account of his being non compos mentis For which act he was much blamed and censured by his ancient friends the clergy who adhered to the King and who rather chose to live in poverty during the usurpation than by a mean compliance with the times betray the interest of the church and the cause of their exiled sovereign  After the King's restoration he quitted the living he held under Cromwell and returned to Eisley near Oxon to live on his archdeaconry and had he not acted a temporizing part it was said he might have been raised to a see or some rich deanery His poetry however got him a name in those days and he stood very fair for preferment and his philosophy discovered in his book de Anima and well languaged sermons says Wood speaks him eminent in his generation and shew him to have traced the rough parts as well as the pleasant paths of poetry  His works are  Three Sermons on the Passion Resurection and Ascension of our Saviour Lond  Two Sermons at Paul's Cross  A Sermon on the Nature of Faith  Motives to a godly Life in Ten Sermons Oxon  Four Sermons against Disloyalty Oxon  Technogamia or the Marriage of Arts a Comedy acted publickly in Christ's Church Hall with no great applause But the Wits of those times being willing to distinguish themselves before the King were resolved with leave to act the same comedy at Woodstock whereupon says Wood the author making some foolish alterations in it it was accordingly acted on Sunday night the th of August but it being too grave for the King and too scholastic for the Audience or as some said that the actors in order to remove their timidity had taken too much wine before they began his Majesty after two acts offered several times to withdraw at length being persuaded by some of those who were near to him to have patience till it was ended lest the young men should be discouraged he sat it out tho' much against his will  upon which these Verses were made by a certain scholar  At Christ Church Marriage done before the King  Lest that those Mates should want an offering  The King himself did offer what I pray  He offered twice or thrice to go away  Survey of the World in Ten Books a Poem Oxon which was judged by Scholars to be an inconsiderable piece and by some not to be his But being published just before his death it was taken for a posthumous work which had been composed by him in his younger Days  Athen Oxon p    He translated out of Latin into English the Satires of Persius Oxon in apologizing for the defects of this work he plays upon the word  translate  To have committed no faults in this translation says he would have been to translate myself and put off man Wood calls this despicable pun an elegant turn  Satires of Juvenal illustrated with Notes Oxon folio At the end of which is the Fourth Edition of Persius before mentioned  Odes of Horace Lond this Translation Wood says is so near that of Sir Thomas Hawkins printed or that of Hawkins so near this that to whom to ascribe it he is in doubt  Dr Holyday who according to the same author was highly conceited of his own worth especially in his younger Days but who seems not to have much reason for being so died at a Village called Eisley on the d day of October and was three days after buried at the foot of Bishop King's monument under the south wall of the isle joining on the south side to the choir of Christ Church Cathedral near the remains of William Cartwright and Jo Gregory  THOMAS NABBES  A Writer in the reign of Charles I whom we may reckon says Langbaine among poets of the third rate but who in strict justice cannot rise above a fifth He was patronized by Sir John Suckling He has seven plays and masks extant besides other poems which Mr Langbaine says are entirely his own and that he has had recourse to no preceding author for assistance and in this respect deserves pardon if not applause from the critic This he avers in his prologue to CoventGarden  He justifies that 'tis no borrowed strain  From the invention of another's brain  Nor did he steal the fancy 'Tis the same  He first intended by the proper name  'Twas not a toil of years few weeks brought forth  This rugged issue might have been more worth  If he had lick'd it more Nor doth he raise  From the ambition of authentic plays  Matter or words to height nor bundle up  Conceits at taverns where the wits do sup  His muse is solitary and alone  Doth practise her low speculation  The reader from the above specimen may see what a poet he was but as he was in some degree of esteem in his time we thought it improper to omit him  The following are his plays  The Bride a Comedy acted in the Year at a private House in DruryLane by their Majesty's Servants printed to  Covent Garden a Comedy acted in the Year  Hannibal and Scipio an Historical Tragedy acted in the year  Microcosmus a Moral Masque represented at a private house in Salisbury Court printed  Spring's Glory Vindicating Love by Temperance against the Tenet Sine Cerere Baccho friget Venus moralized in a Masque With other Poems Epigrams Elegies and Epithalamiums of the author's printed in to London At the end of these poems is a piece called A Presentation intended for the Prince's Birthday May annually celebrated  TottenhamCourt a Comedy acted in the year at a private house in Salisbury Court printed in to  Unfortunate Lovers a Tragedy never acted printed in to London  Mr Philips and Mr Winstanley according to their old custom have ascribed two other anonymous plays to our author The Woman Hater Arraigned a Comedy and Charles the First a Tragedy which Langbaine has shewn not to be his  JAMES SHIRLEY  A VERY voluminous dramatic author was born in the city of London and was descended from the Shirleys in Sussex or Warwickshire he was educated in grammar learning in Merchant Taylors school and transplanted thence to St John's College but in what station he lived there we don't find  Dr William Laud afterwards archbishop of Canterbury presiding over that house conceived a great affection for our author and was willing to cherish and improve those promising abilities early discoverable in him Mr Shirley had always an inclination to enter into holy orders but for a very particular reason was discouraged from attempting it by Dr Laud this reason to some may appear whimsical and ridiculous but has certainly much weight and force in it  Shirley had unfortunately a large mole upon his left cheek which much disfigured him and gave him a very forbidding appearance Laud observed very justly that an audience can scarce help conceiving a prejudice against a man whose appearance  hocks them and were he to preach with the tongue of an angel that prejudice could never be surmounted besides the danger of women with child fixing their eyes on him in the pulpit a  d as the imagination of pregnant women has strange influence on the unborn infants it is somewhat cruel to expose them to that danger and by these means do them great injury as  ones fortune in some measure depends upon exterior comeliness  Athen Oxon p  But Shirley who was resolute to be in orders left that university soon after went to Cambridge there took the degrees in arts and became a minister near St Alban's in Hertfordshire but never having examined the authority and purity of the Protestant Church and being deluded by the sophistry of some Romish priests he changed his religion for theirs  Wood ubi supra  quitted his living and taught a grammar school in the town of St Alban's which employment he  ding an intolerable drudgery and being of a fickle unsteady temper he relinquished it came up to London and took lodgings in Gray's Inn where he commenced a writer for the stage with tolerable success He had the good fortune to gain several wealthy and beneficent patrons especially Henrietta Maria the Queen Consort who made him her servant  When the civil war broke out he was driven from London and attended upon his Royal Mistress while his wife and family were left in a deplorable condition behind him Some time after that when the Queen of England was forced by the fury of opposition to sollicit succours from France in order to reinstate her husband our author could no longer wait upon her and was received into the service of William Cavendish marquis of Newcastle to take his fortune with him in the wars That noble spirited patron had given him such distinguishing marks of his liberality as Shirley thought himself happy in his service especially as by these means he could at the same time serve the King  Having mentioned Henrietta Maria Shirley's Royal Mistress the reader will pardon a digression which flows from tenderness and is no more than an expression of humanity Her lifetime in England  was embittered with a continued persecution she lived to see the unhappy death of her Lord she witnessed her exiled sons not only oppressed with want but obliged to quit France at the remonstrance of Cromwel's ambassador she herself was loaded with poverty and as Voltaire observes  "was driven to the most calamitous situation that ever poor lady was exposed to she was obliged to sollicit Cromwel to pay her an allowance as Queen Dowager of England which no doubt she had a right to demand but to demand it nay worse to be obliged to beg it  a man who shed her Husband's blood upon a scaffold is an affliction so excessively heightened that few of the human race ever bore one so severe"  After an active service under the marquis of Newcastle and the King's cause declining beyond hope of recovery Shirley came again to London and in order to support himself and family resumed his former occupation of teaching a school in White Fryars in which he was pretty successful and as Wood says  'educated many ingenious youths who afterwards in various faculties became eminent'  After the Restoration some of the plays our author had written in his leisure moments were represented with success but there is no account whether that giddy Monarch ever rewarded him for his loyalty and indeed it is more probable he did not as he pursued the duke of Lauderdale's maxim too closely of making friends of his enemies and suffering his friends to shift for themselves which infamous maxim drew down dishonour on the administration and government of Charles II Wood further remarks that Shirley much assisted his patron the duke of Newcastle in the composition of his plays which the duke afterwards published and was a drudge to John Ogilby in his translation of Homer's Iliad  and Odysseys by writing annotations on them At length after Mr Shirley had lived to the age of in various conditions having been much agitated in the world he with his second wife was driven by the dismal conflagration that happened in London Anno from his habitation in Fleetstreet to another in St Giles's in the Fields Where being overcome with miseries occasioned by the fire and bending beneath the weight of years they both died in one day and their bodies were buried in one grave in the churchyard of St Giles's on October

Lives of the Poets  Howel himself in one of his familiar epistles says that his ascendant was that hot constellation of Cancer about the middle of the Dog Days After he was educated in grammar learning in the free school of Hereford he was sent to Jesus College in the beginning of took a degree in arts and then quitted the university By the help of friends and a small sum of money his father assisted him with he travelled for three years into several countries where he improved himself in the various languages some years after his return the reputation of his  parts was so great that he was made choice of to be sent into Spain to recover of the Spanish monarch a rich English ship seized by the Viceroy of Sardinia for his master's use upon some pretence of prohibited goods being found in it  During his absence he was elected Fellow of Jesus College and upon his return was patronized by Emanuel lord Scroop Lord President of the North and by him was made his secretary  Athen Oxon p vol ii  As he resided in York he was by the Mayor and Aldermen of Richmond chose a Burgess for their Corporation to sit in that Parliament that began at Westminster in the year Four years after he went secretary to Robert earl of Leicester ambassador extraordinary from England to the King of Denmark before whom he made several Latin speeches shewing the occasion of their embassy viz to condole the death of Sophia Queen Dowager of Denmark Grandmother to Charles I King of England  Our author enjoyed many beneficial employments and at length about the beginning of the civil war was made one of the clerks of the council but being extravagant in his temper all the money he got was not sufficient to preserve him from a Jail When the King was forced from the Parliament and the Royal interest declined Howel was arrested by order of a certain committee who owed him no good will and carried prisoner to the Fleet and having now nothing to depend upon but his wits he was obliged to write and translate books for a livelihood which brought him in says Wood a comfortable subsistance during his stay there he is the first person we have met with in the course of this work who may be said to have made a trade of authorship having written no less than books on different subjects  In the time of the rebellion we find Howel tampering with the prevailing power and ready to have embraced their measures for which reason at the restoration he was not contined in his place of clerk to the council but was only made king's historiographer being the first in England says Wood who bore that title and having no very beneficial employment he wrote books to the last  He had a great knowledge in modern histories especially in those of the countries in which he had travelled and he seems by his letters to have been no contemptible politician As to his poetry it is smoother and more harmonious than was very common with the bards of his time  As he introduced the trade of writing for bread so he also is charged with venal flattery than which nothing can be more ignoble and base To praise a blockhead's wit because he is great is too frequently practised by authors and deservedly draws down contempt upon them He who is favoured and patronized by a great man at the expence of his integrity and honour has paid a dear price for the purchase a miserable exchange patronage for virtue dependance for freedom  Our author died the beginning of November and was buried on the North side of the Temple church  We shall not trouble the reader with an enumeration of all the translations and prose works of this author the occasion of his being introduced here is his having written  Nuptials of Peleus and Thetis consisting of a Masque and a Comedy or the Great Royal Ball acted in Paris six times by the King in person the Duke of Anjou the Duke of York with other Noblemen also by the Princess Royal Henrietta  Maria Princess of Conti c printed in to and addressed to the Marchioness of Dorchester Besides this piece his Dodona's Grove or Vocal Forest is in the highest reputation  His entertaining letters many of whom were written to the greatest personages in England and some in particular to Ben Johnson were first published in four volumes but in the tenth edition of them was published in one volume which is also now become scarce They are interspersed with occasional verses from one of these little pieces we shall select the following specimen of this author's poetical talent  On the Author's Valentine Mrs METCALF  Could I charm the queen of love  To lend a quill of her white dove  Or one of Cupid's pointed wings  Dipt in the fair Castalian Springs  Then would I write the all divine  Perfections of my Valentine  As 'mongst all flow'rs the Rose excells  As Amber 'mongst the fragrant'st smells  As 'mongst all minerals the Gold  As Marble 'mongst the finest mold  As Diamond 'mongst jewels bright  As Cynthia 'mongst the lesser lights  Bad rhimes were uncommon with the poets of Howel's time    So 'mongst the Northern beauties shine  So far excels my Valentine  In Rome and Naples I did view  Faces of celestial hue  Venetian dames I have seen many  I only saw them truck'd not any  Of Spanish beauties Dutch and French  I have beheld the quintessence  Bad rhimes were uncommon with the poets of Howel's time    Yet saw I none that could outshine  Or parallel my Valentine  Th' Italians they are coy and quaint  But they grosly daub and paint  The Spanish kind and apt to please  But sav'ring of the same disease  Of Dutch and French some few are comely  The French are light the Dutch are homely  Let Tagus Po the Loire and Rhine  Then veil unto my Valentine  Sir RICHARD FANSHAW  WAS the youngest and tenth son of Sir Henry Fanshaw of Warepark in Hertfordshire he was born in the year and was initiated in learning by the famous Thomas Farnaby He afterwards compleated his studies in the university of Cambridge and from thence went to travel into foreign countries by which means he became a very accomplished gentleman In he was patronized by King Charles I on account of his early and promising abilities he took him into his service and appointed him resident at the court of Spain  Short Account of Sir Richard Fanshaw prefixed to his Letters  During his embassy there his chief business was to demand reparation  and punishment of some freebooters who had taken ships from the English and to endeavour the restoration of amity trade and commerce  When the civil war broke out he returned to England having accomplished the purposes of his embassy abroad and attached himself with the utmost zeal to the Royal Standard and during those calamitous times was intrusted with many important matters of state  In attending the court at Oxford the degree of Doctor of Civil Laws was conferred upon him  Wood Fast ed vol ii col  and the reputation of his parts every day increasing he was thought a proper person to be secretary to Charles Prince of Wales whom he attended into the Western parts of England and from thence into the Isles of Scilly and Jersey  In he was appointed treasurer of the navy under the command of Prince Rupert in which office he continued till the year when he was created a baronet by King Charles II and sent envoy extraordinary to the court of Spain Being recalled thence into Scotland where the King then was he served there in quality of secretary of state to the satisfaction of all parties notwithstanding he refused to take the covenant engagements which Charles II forced by the importunity of the Presbyterians entered into with a resolution to break them In he was made prisoner at the battle of Worcester and committed to close custody in London where he continued 'till his confinement introduced a very dangerous sickness he then had liberty granted him upon giving bail to go for the recovery of his health into any place he should chuse provided he stirred not five miles from thence without leave from the Parliament  In February he repaired to the King at  Breda who knighted him the April following Upon his Majesty's restoration it was expected from his great services and the regard the King had for him that he would have been made secretary of state but at that period there were so many people's merits to repay and so great a clamour for preferment that Sir Richard was disappointed but had the place of master of requests conferred on him a station in those times of considerable profit and dignity  On account of his being a good Latin scholar he was also made a secretary for that tongue  Wood ubi supra  In being one of the burgesses for the university of Cambridge he was sworn a privy counsellor for Ireland and having by his residence in foreign parts qualified himself for public employment he was sent envoy extraordinary to Portugal with a dormant commission to the ambassador which he was to make use of as occasion should require Shortly after he was appointed ambassador to that court where he negotiated the marriage between his master King Charles II and the Infanta Donna Catharina daughter to King John VI and towards the end of the same year he returned to England We are assured by Wood that in the year he was sent again ambasfador to that court and when he had finished his commission to the mutual satisfaction of Charles II and Alphonso King of Portugal being recalled in he was sworn one of his Majesty's Privy Council In the beginning of the year he was sent ambassador to Philip IV King of Spain and arrived February at Cadiz where he met with a very extraordinary and unexpected salutation and was received with some circumstances of particular esteem It appears from one of Sir Richard's letters that this distinguishing respect was paid him not only on his own but on his  master's account and in another of his letters he discovers the secret why the Spaniard yielded him contrary to his imperious proud nature so much honour and that is that he expected Tangier and Jamaica to be restored to him by England which occasioned his arrival to be so impatiently longed for and magnificently celebrated During his residence at this court King Philip died September leaving his son Charles an infant and his dominions under the regency of his queen Mary Anne daughter of the emperor Ferdinand III Sir Richard taking the advantage of his minority put the finishing hand to a peace with Spain which was sufficiently tired and weakened with a years war for the recovery of Portugal which had been dismembered from the Spanish crown in the treaty of peace was signed at Madrid December About the th of January following his excellency took a journey into Portugal where he staid till towards the end of March the design of his journey certainly was to effect an accommodation between that crown and Spain which however was not produced till by the interposition of his Britannic Majesty Our author having finished his commission was preparing for his return to England when June he was seized at Madrid with a violent fever which put an end to his valuable life the th of the same month the very day he intended to set out for England his body being embalmed it was conveyed by his lady and all his children then living by land to Calais and so to London whence being carried to All Saints church in Hertford it was deposited in the vault of his fatherinlaw Sir John Harrison The Author of the Short Account of his Life prefixed to his letters says  'that he was remarkable for his meekness sincerity humanity and piety and also was an able statesman and a great  scholar being in particular a compleat master of several modern languages especially the Spanish which he spoke and wrote with as much advantage as if he had been a native'  By his lady eldest daughter of Sir John Harrison he had six sons and eight daughters whereof only one son and four daughters survived him  The following is an account of his works  An English Translation in Rhyme of the celebrated Italian Pastoral called Il Pastor Fido or the Faithful Shepherd written originally by Battista Guarini printed in London in to and vo  A Translation from English into Latin Verse of the Faithful Shepherdess a Pastoral written originally by John Fletcher Gent London  In the octavo edition of the Faithful Shepherd Anno are inserted the following Poems of our author viz st An Ode upon the Occasion of his Majesty's Proclamation commanding the Gentry to reside upon their Estates in the Country d A Summary Discourse of the Civil Wars of Rome extracted from the best Latin Writers in Prose and Verse d An English Translation of the Fourth Book of Virgil's Aeneid on the Loves of Dido and Aeneas th Two Odes out of Horace relating to the Civil Wars of Rome against covetous rich Men  He translated out of Portuguese into English The Lusiad or Portugal's Historical Poem written originally by Luis de Camoens London c folio  After his decease namely in were published these two posthumous pieces of his in to Querer per solo Querer To Love only for Love's sake a Dramatic Romance represented before the King and Queen of Spain and Fiestas de Aranjuez  Festivals at Aranjuez both written originally in Spanish by Antonio de Mendoza upon occasion of celebrating the Birthday of King Philip IV in at Aranjuez they were translated by our author in during his confinement at Taukerleypark in Yorkshire which uneasy situation induced him to write the following stanzas on this work which are here inserted as a specimen of his versification  Time was when I a pilgrim of the seas  When I 'midst noise of camps and courts disease  Purloin'd some hours to charm rude cares with verse  Which flame of faithful shepherd did rehearse  But now restrain'd from sea from camp from court  And by a tempest blown into a port  I raise my thoughts to muse on higher things  And eccho arms and loves of Queens and Kings  Which Queens despising crowns and Hymen's band  Would neither men obey nor men command  Great pleasure from rough seas to see the shore  Or from firm land to hear the billows roar  We are told that he composed several other things remaining still in manuscript which he had not leisure to compleat even some of the printed pieces have not all the finishing so ingenious an author could have bestowed upon them for as the writer of his Life observes  'being for his loyalty and zeal to his Majesty's service tossed from place to place and from country to country during the unsettled times of our anarchy some of his  Manuscripts falling into unskilful hands were printed and published without his knowledge and before he could give them the last finishing strokes'  But that was not the case with his Translation of the Pastor Fido which was published by himself and applauded by some of the best judges particularly Sir John Denham who after censuring servile translators thus goes on  A new and nobler way thou dost pursue  To make translations and translators too  They but preserve the ashes these the flame  True to his sense but truer to his same  ABRAHAM COWLEY  WAS the son of a Grocer and born in London in Fleetstreet near the end of Chancery Lane in the year His mother by the interest of her friends procured him to be admitted a King's scholar in Westminster school  Wood's Fasti Oxon vol ii col  his early inclination to poetry was occasioned by reading accidentally Spencer's Fairy Queen which as he himself gives an account  'used to lye in his mother's parlour he knew not by what accident for she read no books but those of devotion the knights giants and monsters filled his imagination he read the whole over before he was years old and was made a poet as immediately as a child is made an eunuch'  In the th year of his age being still at Westminster school he published a collection of poems  under the title of Poetical Blossoms in which there are many things that bespeak a ripened genius and a wit rather manly than puerile Mr Cowley himself has given us a specimen in the latter end of an ode written when he was but years of age  'The beginning of it says he is boyish but of this part which I here set down if a very little were corrected I should not be much ashamed of it'  It is indeed so much superior to what might be expected from one of his years that we shall satisfy the reader's curiosity by inserting it here  IX  This only grant me that my means may lye  Too low for envy for contempt too high  Some honour I would have  Not from great deeds but good alone  The unknown are better than ill known  Rumour can ope the grave  Acquaintance I would have but when 't depends  Not on the number but the choice of friends  X  Books should not business entertain the light  And sleep as undisturbed as death the night  My house a cottage more  Than palace and should fitting be  For all my use no luxury  My garden painted o'er  With nature's hand not art and pleasures yield  Horace might envy in his Sabine field  XI  Thus would I double my life's fading space  For he that runs it well twice runs his race  And in this true delight  These unbought sports that happy state  I could not fear nor wish my fate  But boldly say each night  Tomorrow let my sun his beams display  Or in clouds hide them I have lived today  It is remarkable of Mr Cowley as he himself tells us that he had this defect in his memory that his teachers could never bring him to retain the ordinary rules of grammar the want of which however he abundantly supplied by an intimate acquaintance with the books themselves from whence those rules had been drawn In he was removed to Trinity College in Cambridge being elected a scholar of that house  Essay on himself  His exercises of all kinds were highly applauded with this peculiar praise that they were fit not only for the obscurity of an academical life but to have made their appearance on the true theatre of the world and there he laid the designs and formed the plans of most of the masculine and excellent attempts he afterwards happily finished In he published his Love's Riddle written at the time of his being a scholar in Westminster school and dedicated by a copy of verses to Sir Kenelm Digby He also wrote a Latin Comedy entitled Naufragium Joculare or the Merry Shipwreck The first occasion of his entering into business was an elegy he wrote on the death of Mr William Harvey which introduced him to the acquaintance of Mr John Harvey the brother of his deceased friend from whom he received many offices of kindness through the whole course of his life  Sprat's Account of Cowley  In being then master of arts he was among many others ejected his college and the university whereupon retiring to Oxford he settled  in St John's College and that same year under the name of a scholar of Oxford published a satire entitled the Puritan and the Papist His zeal in the Royal cause engaged him in the service of the King and he was present in many of his Majesty's journies and expeditions by this means he gained an acquaintance and familiarity with the personages of the court and of the gown and particularly had the entire friendship of my lord Falkland one of the principal secretaries of state  During the heat of the civil war he was settled in the family of the earl of St Alban's and accompanied the Queen Mother when she was obliged to retire into France He was absent from his native country says Wood about ten years during which time he laboured in the affai  s of the Royal Family and bore part of the distresses inflicted upon the illustrious Exiles for this purpose he took several dangerous journies into Jersey Scotland Flanders Holland and elsewhere and was the principal instrument in maintaining a correspondence between the King and his Royal Consort whose letters he cyphered and decyphered with his own hand  His poem called the Mistress was published at London of which he himself says  "That it was composed when he was very young Poets says he are scarce thought free men of their company without paying some duties and obliging themselves to be true to love Sooner or later they must all pass through that trial like some Mahometan monks who are bound by their order once at least in their life to make a pilgrimage to Mecca But we must not always make a judgment of their manners from their writings of this kind as the Romanists uncharitably do of Beza for a few lascivious  sonnets composed by him in his youth It is not in this sense that poetry is said to be a kind of painting It is not the picture of the poet but of things and persons imagined by him He may be in his practice and disposition a philosopher and yet sometimes speak with the softness of an amorous Sappho I would not be misunderstood as if I affected so much gravity as to be ashamed to be thought really in love On the contrary I cannot have a good opinion of any man who is not at least capable of being so"  What opinion Dr Sprat had of Mr Cowley's Mistress appears by the following passage extracted from his Life of Cowley  "If there needed any excuse to be made that his loveverses took up so great a share in his works it may be alledged that they were composed when he was very young but it is a vain thing to make any kind of apology for that sort of writing If devout or virtuous men will superciliously forbid the minds of the young to adorn those subjects about which they are most conversant they would put them out of all capacity of performing graver matters when they come to them for the exercise of all men's wit must be always proper for their age and never too much above it and by practice and use in lighter arguments they grow up at last to excell in the most weighty I am not therefore ashamed to commend Mr Cowley's Mistress I only except one or two expressions which I wish I could have prevailedwith those that had the right of the other edition to have left out but of all the rest I dare boldly pronounce that never yet was written so much on a subject so delicate that can less offend the severest rules of morality The whole passion of love is intimately described by all its  mighty train of hopes joys and disquiets Besides this amorous tenderness I know not how in every copy there is something of more useful knowledge gracefully insinuated and every where there is something seigned to inform the minds of wise men as well as to move the hearts of young men or women"  Our author's comedy named the Guardian he afterwards altered and published under the title of the Cutter of ColemanStreet Langbaine says notwithstanding Mr  owley's modest opinion of this play it was acted not only at Cambridge but several times afterwards privately during the prohibition of the stage and after the King's return publickly at Dublin and always with applause It was this probably that put the author upon revising it after which he permitted it to appear publickly on the stage under a new title at his royal highness the Duke of York's theatre It met with opposition at first from some who envied the author's unshaken loyalty but afterwards it was acted with general applause and was esteemed by the critics an excellent comedy  In the year it was judged proper by those on whom Mr Cowley depended that he should come over into England and under pretence of privacy and retirement give notice of the situation of affairs in this nation Upon his return he published a new edition of all his poems consisting of four parts viz  Miscellanies  The Mistress or several copies of loveverses  Pindarique Odes written in imitation of the stile and manner of Pindar  Davedeis a sacred poem of the troubles of David in four books  "Which says Dr Sprat was written in so young an age that if we shall reflect on the vastness of the argument and his manner of hardling it he may seem like one of the miracles that he there adorns like a boy attempting Goliah This perhaps may be the reason that in some places there may be more youthfulness and redundance of fancy than his riper judgement would have allowed But for the main of it I will affirm that it is a better instance and beginning of a divine poem than ever I yet saw in any language The contrivance is perfectly ancient which is certainly the true form of an heroic poem and such as was never yet done by any new devices of modern wits The subject was truly divine even according to God's own heart The matters of his invention all the treasures of knowledge and histories of the bible The model of it comprehended all the learning of the East The characters lofty and various the numbers firm and powerful the digressions beautiful and proportionable The design to submit mortal wit to heavenly truths In all there is an admirable mixture of human virtues and passions with religious raptures The truth is continues Dr Sprat methinks in other matters his wit exceeded all other men's but in his moral and divine works it outdid itself and no doubt it proceeded from this cause that in the lighter kinds of poetry he chiefly represented the humours and affections of others but in these he sat to himself and drew the figure of his own mind We have the first book of the Davideis translated out of English into very elegant Latin by Mr Cowley himself"  Dr Sprat says of his Latin poetry  "that he has expressed to admiration all the numbers of verse and figures of poetry  that are scattered up and down amongst the ancients and that there is hardly to be found in them any good fashion of speech or colour of measure but he has comprehended it and given instances of it according as his several arguments required either a majestic spirit or passionate or pleasant This he observes is the more extraordinary in that it was never yet performed by any single poet of the ancient Romans themselves"  The same author has told us that the occasion of Mr Cowley's falling on the pindarique way of writing was his accidentally meeting with Pindar's works in a place where he had no other books to direct him Having thus considered at leisure the heighth of his invention and the majesty of his stile he tried immediately to imitate it in English and he performed it says the Dr without the danger that Horace presaged to the man that should attempt it Two of our greatest poets after allowing Mr Cowley to have been a successful imitator of Pindar yet find fault with his numbers Mr Dryden having told us that our author brought Pindaric verse as near perfection as possible in so short a time adds  "But if I may be allowed to speak my mind modestly and without injury to his sacred ashes somewhat of the purity of English somewhat of more sweetness in the numbers in a word somewhat of a finer turn and more lyrical verse is yet wanting"  and Mr Congreve having excepted against the irregularity of the measure of the English Pindaric odes yet observes  "that the beauty of Mr Cowley's verses are an attonement for the irregularity of his stanzas and tho' he did not imitate Pindar in the strictness of his numbers he has very often happily copied him in the force of his figures and sublimity of his stile and sentiments"  Soon after his return to England he was seized upon thro' mistake the search being intended after another gentleman of considerable note in the King's party The Rep  blicans who were sensible how much they needed the assistance and coalition of good men endeavoured sometimes by promises and sometimes by threatning to bring our author over to their interest but all their attempts proving fruitless he was committed to a severe confinement and with some difficulty at last obtained his liberty after giving a thousand pounds bail which Dr Scarborough in a friendly manner took upon himself Under these bonds he continued till Cromwell's death when he ventured back into France and there remained as Dr Sprat says in the same situation as before till near the time of the King's return This account is a sufficient vindication of Mr Cowley's unshaken loyalty which some called in question and as this is a material circumstance in the life of Cowley we shall give an account of it in the words of the elegant writer of his life just now mentioned as it is impossible to set it in a fairer or more striking light than is already done by that excellent prelate  "The cause of his loyalty being called in question he tells us was a sew lines in a preface to one of his books the objection says he I must not pass in silence because it was the only part of his life that was liable to misinterpretation even by the confession of those that envied his same"  "In this case it were enough to alledge for him to men of moderate minds that what he there said was published before a book of poetry and so ought rather to be esteemed as a problem of his fancy and invention than as a cal image of his judgement but his de  ce in this matter may be laid on a surer  foundation This is the true reason to be given of his delivering that opinion Upon his coming over he found the state of the royal party very desperate He perceived the strength of their enemies so united that till it should begin to break within itself all endeavours against it were like to prove unsuccessful On the other side he beheld their zeal for his Majesty's cause to be still so active that often hurried them into inevitable ruin He saw this with much grief and tho' he approved their constancy as much as any man living yet he found their unreasonable shewing it did only disable themselves and give their adversaries great advantages of riches and strength by their defeats He therefore believed it would be a meritorious service to the King if any man who was known to have followed his interest could insinuate into the Usurper's minds that men of his principles were now willing to be quiet and could persuade the poor oppressed Royalists to conceal their affections for better occasions And as for his own particular he was a close prisoner when he writ that against which the exception is made so that he saw it was impossible for him to pursue the ends for which he came hither if he did not make some kind of declaration of his peaceable intentions This was then his opinion and the success of the thing seems to prove that it was not illgrounded For certainly it was one of the greatest helps to the King's affairs about the latter end of that tyranny that many of his best friends dissembled their counsels and acted the same designs under the disguises and names of other parties The prelate concludes this account with observing that that life must needs be very  unblameable which had been tried  n business of the highest consequence and practised in the hazardous secrets of courts and cabinet and yet there can nothing disgraceful be produced against it but only the error of one paragraph and single metaphor"  About the year his two Books of Plants were published to which he added afterwards fourmore and all these together with his Latin poems were printed in London  his Books on Plants was written during his residence in England in the time of the usurpation the better to distinguish his real intention by the study of physic to which he applied  It appears by Wood's Fasti Oxon that our poet was created Dr of Physic at Oxford December by virtue of a mandamus from the then government After the King's restoration Mr Cowley being then past the th year of his age the greatest part of which had been spent in a various and tempestuous condition resolved to pass the remainder of his life in a studious retirement In a letter to one of his friends he talks of making a voyage to America not from a view of accumulating wealth but there to chuse a habitation and shut himself up from the busy world for ever This scheme was wildly romantic and discovered some degree of vanity in the author for Mr Cowley needed but retire a few miles out of town and cease from appearing abro  d and he might have been sufficiently secured against the int  ision of company nor was he of so much consequence as to be forced from his retirement but this visionary scheme could not be c  rr  ed into execution by means of Mr Cowley's want of money for he had never been much on the road of gain Upon the settlement of the peace of the nation he obtained a competent estate by the favour of his principal patrons the duke of Buckingham and the earl of St Albans Thus furnished  for a retreat he spent the last seven or eight years of his life in his beloved obscurity and possessed says Sprat that solitude which from his very childhood he so passionately desired This great poet and worthy man died at a house called the Porchhouse towards the West end of the town of Chertsey in Surry July in the th year of his age His solitude from the very beginning had never agreed so well with the constitution of his body as his mind out of haste to abandon the tumult of the city he had not prepared a healthful situation in the country as he might have done had he been more deliberate in his choice of this he soon began to find the inconvenience at Barnelms where he was afflicted with a dangerous and lingring fever Shortly after his removal to Chertsey he fell into another consuming disease having languished under this for some months he seemed to be pretty well cured of its ill symptoms but in the heat of the summer by staying too long amongst his labourers in the meadows he was taken with a violent defluxion and stoppage in his breast and throat this he neglected as an ordinary cold and refused to send for his usual physicians 'till it was past all remedy and so in the end after a sortnight's sickness it proved mortal to him  He was buried in Westminster Abbey the d of August following near the ashes of Chaucer and Spenser King Charles II was pleased to bestow upon him the best character when upon the news of his death his Majesty declared that Mr Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England A monument was erected to his memory in May by George duke of Buckingham with a Latin inscription written by Dr Sprat afterwards lord bishop of Rochester  Besides Mr Cowley's works already mentioned we have by the same hand A Proposition for the advancement  of Experimental Philosophy A Discourse by way of Vision concerning the Government of Oliver Cromwel and several Discourses by way of Essays in Prose and Verse Mr Cowley had designed a Discourse on Stile and a Review of the Principles of the Primitive Christian Church but was prevented by death In Mr Dryden's Miscellany Poems we find a poem on the Civil War said to be written by our author but not extant in any edition of his works Dr Sprat mentions as very excellent in their kind Mr Cowley's Letters to his private friends none of which were published As a poet Mr Cowley has had tribute paid him from the greatest names in all knowledge Dryden Addison Sir John Denham and Pope He is blamed for a redundance of wit and roughness of versification but is allowed to have possessed a fine understanding great reading and a variety of genius Let us see how Mr Addison characterizes him in his Account of the great English Poets  Great Cowley then a mighty genius wrote  O'errun with wit and lavish of his thought  His turns too closely on the readers press  He more had pleased us had he pleased us less  One glittering thought no sooner strikes our eyes  With silent wonder but new wonders rise  As in the milky way a shining white  O'erflows the heavens with one continued light  That not a single star can shew his rays  Whilst jointly all promote the common blaze  Pardon great poet that I dare to name  Th' uncumber'd beauties of thy verse with blame  Thy fault is only wit in its excess  But wit like thine in any shape will please  In his public capacity he preserved an inviolable honour and loyalty and exerted great activity  with discernment in private life he was easy of access gentle polite and modest none but his intimate friends ever discovered by his discourse that he was a great poet he was generous in his disposition temperate in his life devout and pious in his religion a warm friend and a social companion Such is the character of the great Mr Cowley who deserves the highest gratitude from posterity as well for his public as private conduct He never prostituted his muse to the purposes of lewdness and folly and it is with pleasure we can except him from the general and too just charge brought against the poets That they have abilities to do the greatest service and by misdirecting them too frequently fawn the harlot face of loose indulgence and by dressing up pleasure in an elegant attire procure votaries to her altar who pay too dear for gazing at the shewy phantom by loss of their virtue It is no compliment to the taste of the present age that the works of Mr Cowley are falling into disesteem they certainly contain more wit and good sense than the works of many other poets whom it is now fashionable to read that kind of poetry which is known by the name of Light he succeeds beyond any of his cotemporaries or successors no love verses in our language have so much true wit and expressive tenderness as Cowley's Mistress which is indeed perfect in its kind What Mr Addison observes is certainly true  'He more had pleased us had he pleased us less'  He had a soul too full an imagination too fertile to be restrained and because he has more wit than any other poet an ordinary reader is somehow disposed to think he had less In the particular of wit none but Shakespear ever exceeded Cowley and he was certainly as cultivated a scholar as a great natural genius In that kind of poetry which is grave and demands extensive thinking no poet has a right to be compared  with Cowley Pope and Dryden who are as remarkable for a force of thinking as elegance of poetry are yet inferior to him there are more ideas in one of Cowley's pindaric odes than in any piece of equal length by those two great genius's St Caecilia's ode excepted and his pindaric odes being now neglected can proceed from no other cause than that they demand too much attention for a common reader and contain sentiments so sublimely noble as not to be comprehended by a vulgar mind but to those who think and are accustomed to contemplation they appear great and ravishing In order to illustrate this we shall quote specimens in both kinds of poetry the first taken from his Mistress called Beauty the other is a Hymn to Light both of which are so excellent in their kind that whoever reads them without rapture may be well assured that he has no poetry in his soul and is insensible to the flow of numbers and the charms of sense  BEAUTY  I  Beauty thou wild fantastic ape  Who dost in ev'ry country change thy shape  Here black there brown here tawny and there white  Thou flatt'rer which

the first who refined our poetry and did more for the interest of the drama than any who ever wrote for the stage He lived in times of general confusion and was no unactive member of the state when its necessities demanded his assistance and when with the restoration politeness and genius began to revive he applied himself to the promotion of these rational pleasures which are fit to entertain a cultivated people This great man was son of one Mr John Davenant a citizen of Oxford and was born in the month of February all the biographers of our poet have observed that his father was a man of a grave disposition and a gloomy turn of mind which his son did not inherit from him for he was as remarkably volatile as his father was saturnine The same biographers have celebrated our author's mother as very handsome whose charms had the power of attracting the admiration of Shakespear the highest compliment which ever was paid to beauty As Mr Davenant our poet's father kept a tavern Shakespear in his journies to Warwickshire spent some time there influenced as many believe by the engaging qualities of the handsome landlady This circumstance has given rise to a conjecture that Davenant was really the son of Shakespear as well naturally as poetically by an  unlawful intrigue between his mother and that great man that this allegation is founded upon probability no reader can believe for we have such accounts of the amiable temper and moral qualities of Shakespear that we cannot suppose him to have been guilty of such an act of treachery as violating the marriage honours and however he might have been delighted with the conversation or charmed with the person of Mrs Davenant yet as adultery was not then the fashionable vice it would be injurious to his memory so much as to suppose him guilty  Our author received the first rudiments of polite learning from Mr Edward Sylvester who kept a grammar school in the parish of All Saints in Oxford In the year the same in which his father was Mayor of the city he was entered a member of the university of Oxford in Lincoln'sInn College under the tuition of Mr Daniel Hough but the Oxford antiquary is of opinion he did not long remain there as his mind was too much addicted to gaiety to bear the austerities of an academical life and being encouraged by some gentlemen who admired the vivacity of his genius he repaired to court in hopes of making his fortune in that pleasing but dangerous element He became first page to Frances duchess of Richmond a lady much celebrated in those days as well for her beauty as the influence she had at court and her extraordinary taste for grand  ur which excited her to keep a kind of private court of her own which in our more fashionable aera is known by the name of Drums Routs and Hurricanes Sir William afterwards removed into the family of Sir Fulk Greville lord Brooke who being himself a man of taste and erudition gave the most encouraging marks of esteem to our rising bard This worthy nobleman being brought to an immature fate by the cruel hands of an assassin Davenant was  left without a patron though not in very indigent circumstances his reputation having increased during the time he was in his lordship's service the year ensuing the death of his patron he produced his first play to the world called Albovino King of the Lombards which met with a very general and warm reception and to which some very honourable recommendations were prefixed when it was printed in several copies of verses by men of eminence amongst whom were Sir Henry Blount Edward Hyde afterwards earl of Clarendon and the honourable Henry Howard Our author spent the next eight years of his life in a constant attendance upon court where he was highly caressed by the most shining characters of the times particularly by the earl of Dorset Edward Hyde and Lord Treasurer Weston during these gay moments spent in the court amusements an unlucky accident happened to our author which not a little deformed his face which from nature was very handsome Wood has affirmed that this accident arose from libidinous dalliance with a handsome black girl in Axeyard Westminster The plain fact is this Davenant was of an amorous complexion and was so unlucky as to carry the marks of his regular gallantries in the depression of his nose this exposed him to the pleasant raillery of cotemporary wits which very little affected him and to shew that he was undisturbed by their merriment he wrote a burlesque copy of verses upon himself This accident happened pretty early in his life since it gave occasion to the following stanzas in Sir John Suckling's Sessions of the Poets which we have transcribed from a correct copy of Suckling's works  Will Davenant ashamed of a foolish mischance  That he had got lately travelling in France  Modestly hop'd the handsomness of his muse  Might any deformity about him excuse  Surely the company had been content  If they cou'd have found any precedent  But in all their recor  in verse or prose  There was none of a laureat who wanted a nose  Suckling here differs from the Oxford historian in saying that Sir William's disorder was contracted in France but as Wood is the highest authority it is more reasonable to embrace his observation and probably Suckling only mentioned France in order that it might rhime with mischance  Some time after this Davenant was rallied by another hand on account of this accident as if it had been a jest that could never die but what is more extraordinary is that Sir William himself could not forget the authoress of this misfortune but has introduced her in his Gondibert and in the opinion of some critics very improperly He brings two friends Ulfinore the elder and Goltho the younger on a journey to the court of Gondibert but in this passage to shew as he would insinuate the extream frailty of youth they were arrested by a very unexpected accident notwithstanding the wise councils which Ulfinore had just received from his father  Gond b iii cant stanz  The lines which have an immediate reference to this fair enchantress are too curious to be here omitted  I  The blackey'd beauty did her pride display  Thro' a large window and in jewels shone  As if to please the world weeping for day  Night had put all her starry jewels on  II  This beauty gaz'd on both and Ulfinore  Hung down his head but yet did lift his eyes  As if he fain would see a little more  For much tho' bashful he did beauty prize  IV  Goltho did like a blushless statue stare  Boldly her practis'd boldness did outlook  And even for fear she would mistrust her snare  Was ready to cry out that he was took  IV  She with a wicked woman's prosp'rous art  A seeming modesty the window clos'd  Wisely delay'd his eyes since of his heart  She thought she had sufficiently dispos'd  V  Nicely as bridegroom's was her chamber drest  Her bed as brides and richer than a throne  And sweeter seem'd than the Circania's nest  Though built in Eastern groves of Cinnamon  VI  The price of princes pleasure who her love  Tho' but false were at rates so costly bought  The wealth of many but many hourly prove  Spoils to some one by whom herself is caught  VII  She sway'd by sinful beauty's destiny  Finds her tyrannic power must now expire  Who meant to kindle Goltho in her eye  But to her breast has brought the raging fire  IX  Yet even in simple love she uses art  Tho' weepings are from looser eyes but leaks  Yet eldest lovers scarce would doubt her heart  So well she weeps as she to Galtho speaks  During our author's attendance at court he wrote several plays and employed his time in framing masques which were acted by the principal nobility of both sexes the Queen herself condescended to take a share in one of them which gave very great offence to the scrupulous moralists which sprung up in those days the particular account of this dramatic piece we shall give in the conclusion of his life and now proceed in enumerating the incidents of it  Upon the death of Ben Johnson which happened in the year our poet succeeded to his laurel notwithstanding the violent opposition of his competitor Thomas May who was so extremely affected with his disappointment though he had been a zealous courtier yet from resentment to the Queen by whose interest Davenant was preferred he commenced an enemy to the King's party and became both an advocate and historian for the Parliament  As soon as the civil war broke out Mr Davenant had an early share in them and demonstrated his loyalty by speaking and acting for the King He was accused by the Parliament for being embarked in a design in May of seducing the army from their adherence to the parliamentary authority and bringing it again under the subjection of the King and defence of his person In this scheme many of Sir William's friends were engaged viz Mr Henry Piercy afterwards lord Piercy Mr Goring Mr Jermyn  Mr Ashburnham Sir John Suckling and others most of these persons upon their design being discovered placed their security in flight and Mr Davenant amongst the rest but a proclamation being published for apprehending him he was stopped at Feversham sent up to town and put into the custody of a sergeant at arms  Athen Oxon vol ii col  In the month of July following our author was bailed and not long after finding it necessary on account of the violence of the times to withdraw to France he had the misfortune to be seized again in Kent by the Mayor of Canterbury how he escaped the present danger none of his biographers have related but it appears that he did not upon this occasion suffer long confinement he at last retired beyond sea where he continued for some time but the Queen sending over a considerable quantity of military stores for the use of the earl of Newcastle's army Mr Davenant returned again to England offered his service to that noble peer who was his old friend and patron and by him made lieutenantgeneral of his ordnance this promotion gave offence to many who were his rivals in his lordship's esteem they remonstrated that Sir William Davenant being a poet was for that very reason unqualified for a place of so much trust and which demanded one of a solid and less volatile turn of mind than the sons of Parnassus generally are In this complaint they paid but an indifferent compliment to the General himself who was a poet and had written and published several plays That Davenant behaved well in his military capacity is very probable since in the month of September he received the honour of knighthood from the King at the siege of Gloucester an acknowledgment of his bravery and signal services which bestowed at a time when  a strict scrutiny was made concerning the merit of officers puts it beyond doubt that Davenant in his martial character was as deserving as in his poetical During these severe contentions and notwithstanding his public character our author's muse sometimes raised her voice in the composition of several plays of which we shall give some account when we enumerate his dramatic performances History is silent as to the means which induced Davenant to quit the Northern army but as soon as the King's affairs so far declined as to afford no hopes of a revival he judged it necessary to retire into France where he was extremely well received by the Queen into whose confidence he had the honour to be taken and was intrusted with the negotiation of matters of the highest importance in the summer of the year Before this time Sir William had embraced the popish religion which circumstance might so far ingratiate him with the queen as to trust him with the most important concerns Lord Clarendon who had a particular esteem for him has given a full account of this affair though not much to his advantage but yet with all the tenderness due to Sir William's good intentions and of that long and intimate acquaintance that had subsisted between them which is the more worthy the reader's notice as it has entirely escaped the observation of all those who have undertaken to write this gentleman's Memoirs though the most remarkable passage in his whole life  The King in retiring to the Scots had followed the advice of the French ambassador who had promised on their behalf if not more than he had authority to do at least more than they were inclined to perform to justify however his conduct at home he was inclined to throw the weight in some measure upon the King and with this view he by an express informed cardinal Mazarine  that his Majesty was too reserved in giving the Parliament satisfaction and therefore desired that some person might be sent over who had a sufficient degree of credit with the English Monarch to persuade him to such compliances as were necessary for his interest  'The Queen says the noble historian who was never advised by those who either understood or valued her Husband's interest consulted those about her and sent Sir William Davenant an honest man and a witty but in all respects unequal to such a trust with a letter of credit to the King who knew the person well enough under another character than was likely to give him much credit upon the argument with which he was entrusted although the Queen had likewise otherwise declared her opinion to his Majesty that he should part with the church for his peace and security'  Sir William had by the countenance of the French ambassador easy admission to the King who heard patiently all he had to say and answered him in in a manner which demonstrated that he was not pleased with the advice When he found his Majesty unsatisfied and not disposed to consent to what was earnestly desired by those by whom he had been sent who undervalued all those scruples of conscience with which his Majesty was so strongly possessed he took upon himself the liberty of offering some reasons to the king to induce him to yield to what was proposed and among other things said it was the opinion and advice of all his friends his Majesty asked what friends to which Davenant replied lord Jermyn and lord Colepepper the King upon this observed that lord Jermyn did not understand any thing of the church and that Colepepper was of no religion but says his Majesty what is the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to which Davenant answered he did not know that he was not there and had  deserted the Prince and thereupon mentioned the Queen's displeasure against the Chancellor to which the King said  'The Chancellor was an honest man and would never desert him nor the Prince nor the Church and that he was sorry he was not with his son but that his wife was mistaken'  Davenant then offering some reasons of his own in which he treated the church with indignity his Majesty was so transported with anger that he gave him a sharper rebuke than he usually gave to any other man and forbad him again ever to presume to come into his presence upon which poor Davenant was deeply affected and returned into France to give an account of his ill success to those who sent him  Upon Davenant's return to Paris he associated with a set of people who endeavoured to alleviate the distresses of exile by some kind of amusement The diversion which Sir William chose was of the literary sort and having long indulged an inclination of writing an heroic poem and having there much leisure and some encouragement he was induced to undertake one of a new kind the two first books of which he finished at the Louvre where he lived with his old friend Lord Jermyn and these with a preface addressed to Mr Hobbs his answer and some commendatory poems were published in England of which we shall give some further account in our animadversions upon Gondibert  While he employed himself in the service of the muses Henrietta Maria the queen dowager of England whose particular favour  te he was found out business for him of another nature She had heard that vast improvements might be made in the loyal colony of Virginia in case proper artificers were sent there and there being many of these in France who were destitute of  employment she encouraged Sir William to collect these artificers together who accordingly embarked with his little colony at one of the ports in Normandy but in this expedition he was likewise unfortunate for before the vessel was clear of the French coast she was met by one of the Parliament ships of war and carried into the isle of Wight where our disappointed projector was sent close prisoner to Cowes Castle and there had leisure enough and what is more extraordinary wanted not inclination to resume his heroic poem and having written about half the third book in a very gloomy prison he thought proper to stop short again finding himself as he imagined under the very shadow of death Upon this occasion it is reported of Davenant that he wrote a letter to Hobbes in which he gives some account of the progress he made in the third book of Gondibert and offers some criticisms upon the nature of that kind of poetry but why says he should I trouble you or myself with these thoughts when I am pretty certain I shall be hanged next week This gaiety of temper in Davenant while he was in the most deplorable circumstances of distress carries something in it very singular and perhaps could proceed from no other cause but conscious innocence for he appears to have been an inoffensive good natured man He was conveyed from the Isle of Wight to the Tower of London and for some time his life was in the utmost hazard nor is it quite certain by what means he was preserved from falling a sacrifice to the prevailing fury Some conjecture that two aldermen of York to whom he had been kind when they were prisoners interposed their influence for him others more reasonably conjecture that Milton was his friend and prevented the utmost effects of party rage from descending on the head of this son of the muses But by whatever means  his life was saved we find him two years after a prisoner of the Tower where he obtained some indulgence by the favour of the Lord Keeper Whitlocke upon receiving which he wrote him a letter of thanks which as it serves to illustrate how easily and politely he wrote in prose we shall here insert It is far removed either from meanness or bombast and has as much elegance in it as any letters in our language  MY LORD  "I am in suspense whether I should present my thankfulness to your lordship for my liberty of the Tower because when I consider how much of your time belongs to the public I conceive that to make a request to you and to thank you afterwards for the success of it is to give you no more than a succession of trouble unless you are resolved to be continually patient and courteous to afflicted men and agree in your judgment with the late wise Cardinal who was wont to say If he had not spent as much time in civilities as in business he had undone his master But whilst I endeavour to excuse this present thankfulness I should rather ask your pardon for going about to make a present to you of myself for it may argue me to be incorrigible that after so many afflictions I have yet so much ambition as to desire to be at liberty that I may have more opportunity to obey your lordship's commands and shew the world how much I am"  "My Lord Your lordship's most Obliged most humble And obedient servant WM DAVENANT"  Our author was so far happy as to obtain by this letter the favour of Whitlocke who was perhaps a man of more humanity and gentleness of disposition than some other of the covenanters He at last obtained his liberty entirely and was delivered from every thing but the narrowness of his circumstances and to redress these encouraged by the interest of his friends he likewise made a bold effort He was conscious that a playhouse was entirely inconsistent with the gloominess and severity of these times and yet he was certain that there were people of taste enough in town to fill one if such a scheme could be managed which he conducted with great address and at last brought to bear as he had the countenance of lord Whitlocke Sir John Maynard and other persons of rank who really were ashamed of the cant and hypocrisy which then prevailed In consequence of this our poet opened a kind of theatre at Rutland House where several pieces were acted and if they did not gain him reputation they procured him what is more solid and what he then more wanted money Some of the people in power it seems were lovers of music and tho' they did not care to own it they were wise enough to know that there was nothing scandalous or immoral in the diversions of the theatre Sir William therefore when he applied for a permission called what he intended to represent an opera but when he brought it on the stage it appeared quite another thing which when printed had the following title  First day's entertainment at RutlandHouse by declamation and music after the manner of the ancients  This being an introductory piece it demanded all the author's wit to make it answer different intentions for first it was to be so pleasing as to gain applause and next it was to be be so remote from the very appearance of a play as not to give any offence to that pretended sanctity that was then in fashion It began with music then followed a prologue in which the author rallies the oddity of his own performance The curtain being drawn up to the sound of slow and solemn music there followed a grave declamation by one in a guilded rostrum who personated Diogenes and shewed the use and excellency of dramatic entertainments The second part of the entertainment consisted of two lighter declamations the first by a citizen of Paris who wittily rallies the follies of London the other by a citizen of London who takes the same liberty with Paris and its inhabitants To this was tacked a song and after that came a short epilogue The music was composed by Dr Coleman Capt Cook Mr Henry Laws and Mr George Hudson  There were several other pieces which Sir William introduced upon this stage of the same kind which met with as much success as could be expected from the nature of the performances themselves and the temper and disposition of the audience Being thus introduced he at last grew a little bolder and not only ventured to write but to act several new plays which were also somewhat in a new taste that is they were more regular in their structure and the language generally speaking smoother and more correct than the old tragedies These improvements were in a great measure owing to Sir William's long residence in France which gave him an opportunity of reading their best writers and hearing the sentiments  of their ablest critics upon dramatic entertainments where they were as much admired and encouraged as at that time despised in England That the  e were really improvements and that the public stood greatly indebted to Sir William Davenant as a poet and master of a theatre we can produce no less an authority than that of Dryden who beyond any of his predecessors contemporaries or those who have succeeded him understood poetry as an art In his essay on heroic plays he thus speaks  "The first light we had of them on the English theatre says he was from Sir William Davenant It being forbidden him in the religious times to act tragedies or comedies because they contained some matter of scandal to those good people who could more easily dispossess their lawful sovereign than endure a wanton jest he was forced to turn his thoughts another way and to introduce the examples of moral virtue written in verse and performed in recitative music The original of this music and of the scenes which adorned his works he had from the Italian opera's but he heightened his characters as I may probably imagine from the examples of Corneille and some French poets In this condition did this part of poetry remain at his Majesty's return when grown bolder as now owned by public authority Davenant revived the Siege of Rhodes and caused it to be acted as a just drama But as few men have the happiness to begin and finish any new project so neither did he live to make his design perfect There wanted the sulness of a plot and the variety of characters to form it as it ought and perhaps somewhat might have been added to the beauty of the stile all which he would have performed with more  exactness had he pleased to have given us another work of the same nature For myself and others who came after him we are bound with all veneration to his m  mory to acknowledge what advantage we received from that excellent ground work which is laid and since it is an easy thing to add to what is already invented we ought all of us without envy to him or partiality to ourselves to yield him the precedence in it"  Immediately after the restoration there were two companies of players formed one under the title of the King's Servants the other under that of the Duke's Company both by patents from the crown the first granted to Henry Killigrew  Esq  and the latter to Sir William Davenant The King's company acted first at the Red Bull in the upper end of St John's Street and after a year or two removing from place to place they established themselves in DruryLane It was some time before Sir William Davenant compleated his company into which he took all who had formerly played under Mr Rhodes in the CockPit in DruryLane and amongst these the famous Mr Betterton who appeared first to advantage under the patronage of Sir William Davenant He opened the Duke's theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields with his own dramatic performance of the Siege of Rhodes the house being finely decorated and the stage supplied with painted scenes which were by him introduced at least if not invented which afforded certainly an additional beauty to the theatre tho' some have insinuated that fine scenes proved the ruin of acting but as we are persuaded it will be an entertaining circumstance to our Readers to have that matter more fully explained we shall take this opportunity of doing it  In the reign of Charles I dramatic entertainments were accompanied with rich scenery curious machines and other elegant embellishments chiefly conducted by the wonderful dexterity of that celebrated English architect Inigo Jones But these were employed only in masques at court and were too expensive for the little theatres in which plays were then acted In them there was nothing more than a curtain of very coarse stuff upon the drawing up of which the stage appeared either with bare walls on the sides coarsly matted or covered with tapestry so that for the place originally represented and all the successive changes in which the poets of those times freely indulged themselves there was nothing to help the spectator's understanding or to assist the actor's performance but bare imagination In Shakespear's time so undecorated were the theatres that a blanket supplied the place of a curtain and it was a good observation of the in+genious Mr Chitty a gentleman of acknowledged taste in dramatic excellence that the circumstance of the blanket suggested to Shakespear that noble image in Macbeth where the murderer invokes  Thick night to veil itself in the dunnest smoke of Hell  Nor Heaven peep thro' the blanket of the dark  To cry hold hold  It is true that while things continued in this situation there were a great many playhouses sometimes six or seven open at once Of these some were large and in part open where they acted byday light others smaller but better fitted up where they made use of candles The plainness of the theatre made the prices small  and drew abundance of c  pany yet upon the whole it is doubtful whether the sp  ctators in all these houses were really superior in number to those who have frequented the theatres in later times If the spirit and judgment of the actors supplied all deficiencies and made as some would insinuate plays more intelligible without scenes than they afterwards were with them it must be very astonishing neither is it difficult to assign another cause why those who were concerned in playhouses were angry at the introduction of seenes and decorations which was that notwithstanding the advanced prices their profits from that time were continually sinking and an auther of high authority in this case assures us in an historical account of the stage that the whole share  s in Mr Hart's company divided a thousand pounds a year apiece before the expensive decorations became fashionable Sir William Davenant consider  d things in another light he was well acquainted with the alterations which the French theatre had received under the auspice of cardinal Richlieu who had an excellent taste and he remembered the noble contrivances of Inigo Jones which were not at all inferior to the designs of the best French masters Sir William was likewise sensible that the monarch he served was an excellent judge of every thing of this kind and these considerations excited in him a passion for the advancement of the theatre to which the great figure it has since made is chiefly owing Mr Dryden has acknowledged his admirable talents in this way and gratefully remembers the pains taken by our poet to set a work of his in the fairest light possible and to which he ingenuously ascribes the success with which it was received This is the history of the rise and progress of scenery on  our stage which without doubt gives greater life to the entertainment of a play but as the best purposes may be prostituted so there is some reason to believe that the excessive fondness for decorations which now prevails has hurt the true dramatic taste Scenes are to be considered as secondary in a play the means of setting it off with lustre and ought to engross but little attention as it is more important to hear what a character speaks than to observe the place where he stands but now the case is altered The scenes in a Harlequin Sorcerer and other unmeaning pantomimes unknown to our more elegant and judging forefathers procure crowded houses while the noblest strokes of Dryden the delicate touches of Otway and Rowe the wild majesty of Shakespear and the heartfelt language of Lee pass neglected when put in competition with those gewgaws of the stage these feasts of the eye which as they can communicate no ideas so they can neither warm nor reform the heart nor answer one moral purpose in nature  We ought not to omit a circumstance much in favour of Sir William Davenant which proves him to have been as good a man as a poet When at the Restoration those who had been active in disturbing the late reign and secluding their sovereign from the throne became obnoxious to the royal party Milton was likely to feel the vengeance of the court Davenant actuated by a noble principle of gratitude interposed all his influence and saved the greatest ornament of the world from the stroke of an executioner Ten years before that Davenant had been rescued by Milton and he remembered the favour an instance this that generosity gratitude and nobleness of nature is confined to no particular party but the heart of a good man will still discover itself in acts of munificence and kindness however  mistaken he may be in his opinion however warm in state factions The particulars of this extraordinary affair are related in the life of Milton  Sir William Davenant continued at the head of his company of actors and at last transferred them to a new and magnificent theatre built in DorsetGardens where some of his old plays were revived with very singular circumstances of royal kindness and a new one when brought upon the stage met with great applause  The last labour of his pen was in altering a play of Shakespear's called the Tempest so as to render it agreeable to that age or rather susceptible of those theatrical improvements he had brought into fashion The great successor to his laurel in a preface to this play in which he was concerned with Davenant  'says that he was a man of quick and piercing imagination and soon found that somewhat might be added to the design of Shakespear of which neither Fletcher nor Suckling had ever thought and therefore to put the last hand to it he designed the counterpart to Shakespear's plot namely that of a man who had never seen a woman that by this means these two characters of innocence and love might the more illustrate and commend each other This excellent contrivance he was pleased to communicate to me and to desire my assistance in it I confess that from the first moment it so pleased me that I never wrote any thing with so much delight I might likewise do him that justice to acknowledge that my writing received daily amendments and that is the reason why it is not so saulty as the rest that I have done without the help or correction of so judicious a friend The comical parts of the sailors were  also of his invention and writing as may easily be discovered from the stile'  This great man died at his house in little Lincoln'sInnFields April aged and two days afterwards was interred in WestminsterAbbey On his gravestone is inscribed in imitation of Ben Johnson's short epitaph  O RARE SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT  It may not be amiss to observe that his remains rest very near the place out of which those of Mr Thomas May who had been formerly his rival for the bays and the Parliament's historian were removed by order of the ministry As to the family our author left behind him some account of it will be given in the life of his son Dr Charles Davenant who succeeded him as manager of the theatre Sir William's works entire were published by his widow and dedicated to James Duke of York  After many storms of adversity our author spent the evening of his days in ease and serenity He had the happiness of being loved by people of all denominations and died lamented by every worthy good man As a poet unnumbered evidences may be produced in his favour Amongst these Mr Dryden is the foremost for when his testimony can be given in support of poetical merit we reckon all other evidence superfluous and without his all other evidences deficient In his words then we shall sum up Davenant's character as a poet and a man of genius  'I found him says he in his preface to the Tempest of so quick a fancy that nothing was proposed to him on which he could not quickly produce a thought extreamly pleasant and surprizing and these first thoughts of his contrary  to the old Latin proverb were not always the least happy and as his fancy was quick so likewise were the products of it remote and new He borrowed not of any other and his imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any other man His corrections were sober and judicious and he corrected his own writings much more severely than those of another man bestowing twice the labour and pain in polishing which he used in invention'  Before we enumerate the dramatic works of Sir William Davenant it will be but justice to his merit to insert some animadversions on his Gondibert a poem which has been the subject of controversy almost a hundred years that is from its first appearance to the present time Perhaps the dispute had been long ago decided if the author's leisure had permitted him to finish it At present we see it to great disadvantage and if notwithstanding this it has any beauties we may fairly conclude it would have come much nearer perfection if the story begun with so much spirit had been brought to an end upon the author's plan  Mr Hobbes the famous philosopher of Malmsbury in a letter printed in his works affirms  'that he never yet saw a poem that had so much shape of art health of morality and vigour and beauty of expression as this of our author and in an epistle to the honourable Edward Howard author of the British Princes he thus speaks My judgment in poetry has been once already censured by very good wits for commending Gondibert but yet have they not disabled my testimony For what authority is there in wit a jester may have it a man in drink may have it and be fluent over night and wise and dry in the morning What is it and who can tell whether it be better to have  it or no I will take the liberty to praise what I like as well as they and reprehend what they like'  Mr Rymer in his preface to his translation of Rapin's Reflexions on Aristototle's Treatise of Poetry observes that our author's wit is well known and in the preface to that poem there appears some strokes of an extraordinary judgment that he is for unbeaten tracts and new ways of thinking but certainly in the untried seas he is no great discoverer One design of the Epic poets before him was to adorn their own country there finding their heroes and patterns of virtue where example as they thought would have the greater influence and power over posterity  "but this poet says Rymer steers a different course his heroes are all foreigners he cultivates a country that is nothing akin to him and Lombardy reaps the honour of all Other poets chose some action or hero so illustrious that the name of the poem prepared the reader and made way for its reception but in this poem none can divine what great action he intended to celebrate nor is the reader obliged to know whether the hero be Turk or Christian nor do the first lines give any light or prospect into the design Altho' a poet should know all arts and sciences yet ought he discreetly to manage his knowledge He must have a judgment to select what is noble and beautiful and proper for the occasion He must by a particular chemistry extract the essence of things without soiling his wit with dross or trumpery The sort of verse Davenant makes choice of in his Gondibert might contribute much to the vitiating his stile for thereby he obliges himself to stretch every period to the end of four lines Thus the sense is broken perpetually with parentheses the words jumbled in confusion  and darkness spread over all but it must be acknowledged that Davenant had a particular talent for the manners his thoughts are great and there appears something roughly noble thro' the whole"  This is the substance of Rymer's observations on Gondibert Rymer was certainly a scholar and a man of discernment and tho in some parts of the criticisms he is undoubtedly right yet in other parts he is demonstrably wrong He complains that Davenant has la  d the scene of action in Lombardy which Rymer calls neglecting his own country but the critic should have considered that however well it might have pleased the poet's countrymen yet as an epic poem is supposed to be read in every nation enlightened by science there can no objections arise from that quarter by any but those who were of the same country with the author His not making choice of a pompous name and introducing his poem with an exordium is rather a beauty than a fault for by these means he leaves room for surprize which is the first excellency in any poem and to strike out beauties where they are not expected has a happy influence upon the reader Who would think from Milton's introduction that so stupendous a work would ensue and simple dignity is certainly more noble than all the efforts and colourings which art and labour can bestow  The ingenious and learned Mr Blackwall Professor of Greek in the university of Aberdeen in his enquiry into the life and writings of Homer censures the structure of the poem but at the same time pays a compliment to the abilities of the author  "It was indeed says he a very extraordinary project of our ingenious countryman to write an epie poem without mixing allegory or allowing the smallest fiction throughout the composure It was like lopping off a man's  limb and then putting him upon running races tho' it must be owned that the performance shews with what ability he could have acquitted himself had he been found and entire"  Such the animadversions which critics of great name have made on Gondibert and the result is that if Davenant had not power to begin and consummate an epic poem yet by what he has done he has a right to rank in the first class of poets especially when it is considered that we owe to him the great perfection of the theatre and putting it upon a level with that of France and Italy and as the theatrical are the most rational of all amusements the latest posterity should hold his name in veneration who did so much for the advancement of innocent pleasures and blending instruction and gaiety together  The dramatic works of our

Winstanley calls a person well fraught with episcopal qualities was born at Wornal in Bucks in the month of January He was educated partly in grammar learning in the free school at Thame in Oxfordshire and partly in the College school at Westminster from which last he was elected a student in Christ Church  Athen Oxon vol ii p Ed  being then under the tuition of a noted tutor Afterwards he took the degrees in arts and entered into holy orders and soon became a florid preacher and successively chaplain to King James I archdeacon of Colchester residentiary of St Paul's cathedral canon and dean of Rochester in which dignity he was installed the th of February In says Mr Wood he was made bishop of Chichester being one of those persons of unblemished reputation that his Majesty tho' late promoted to that honourable office which he possessed without any removal save that by the members of the Long Parliament to the time of his death  When he was young he delighted much in the study of music and poetry which with his wit and fancy made his conversation very agreeable and when he was more advanced in years he applied himself to oratory philosophy and divinity in which he became eminent  It happened that this bishop attending divine service in a church at Langley in Bucks and hearing there a psalm sung whose wretched expression far from conveying the meaning of the Royal Psalmist not only marred devotion but turned what was excellent in the original into downright burlesque he tried that evening if he could not easily and with plainness suitable to the lowest understanding deliver it from that garb which rendered it ridiculous He finished one psalm and then another and found the work so agreeable and pleasing that all the psalms were in a short time compleated and having shewn the version to some friends of whose judgment he had a high opinion he could not resist their importunity says Wood of putting it to the press or rather he was glad their sollicitations coincided with his desire to be thought a poet  He was the more discouraged says the antiquary as Mr George Sandys's version and another by a reformer had failed in two different extremes the first too elegant for the vulgar use changing both metre and tunes wherewith they had been long acquainted the other as flat and poor and as lamely executed as the old one He therefore ventured in a middle way as he himself in one of his letters expresses it without affectation of words and endeavouring to leave them not disfigured in the sense This version soon after was published with this title  The Psalms of David from the New Translation of the Bible turned into Metre to be sung after the old tunes used in churches Lond in mo  There is nothing more ridiculous than this notion of the vulgar of not parting with their  old versions of the psalms as if there were a merit in singing hymns of nonsense Tate and Brady's version is by far the most elegant and best calculated to inspire devotion because the language and poetry are sometimes elevated and sublime and yet for one church which uses this version twenty are content with that of Sternhold and Hopkins the language and poetry of which as Pope says of Ogilvy's Virgil are beneath criticism  After episcopacy was silenced by the Long Parliament he resided in the house of Sir Richard Hobbart who had married his sister at Langley in Bucks He was reinstated in his See by King Charles II and was much esteemed by the virtuous part of his neighbours and had the blessings of the poor and distressed a character which reflects the highest honour upon him  Whether from a desire of extending his beneficence or instigated by the restless ambition peculiar to the priesthood he sollicited but in vain a higher preferment and suffered his resentment to betray him into measures not consistent with his episcopal character He died on the first day of October  Wood Athen Oxon P vol  and was buried on the south side of the choir near the communion table belonging to the cathedral church in Chichester Soon after there was a monument put over his grave with an inscription in which it is said he was  Antiquâ eáque regia Saxonium apud Danmonios in agro Devoniensi prosapia oriundus  That he was  Natalium Splendore illustris pietate Doctrina et virtutibus illustrior c  This monument was erected at the charge of his widow Anne daughter of Sir William Russel of Strensham in Worcestershire knight and baronet  Our author's works besides the version of the Pfalms already mentioned are as follows  A Deep Groan

shall take a quotation from his version of the th psalm  My soul the Lord for ever bless  O God thy greatness all confess  Whom majesty and honour vest  In robes of light eternal drest  He heaven made his ca  py  His chambers in the waters lye  His chariot is the cloudy storm  And on the wings of wind is born  He spirits makes his angels quire  His ministers a flaming fire  He so did earth's foundations cast  It might remain for ever fast  Then cloath'd it with the spacious deep  Whose wave outswells the mountains steep  At thy rebuke the waters fled  And hid their thunderfrighted head  They from the mountains streaming flow  And down into the vallies go  Then to their liquid center hast  Where their collected floods are cast  These in the ocean met and joyn'd  Thou hast within a bank confin'd  Not suff'ring them to pass their bound  Lest earth by their excess be drown'd  He from the hills his chrystal springs  Down running to the vallies brings  Which drink supply and coolness yield  To thirsting beasts throughout the field  By them the fowls of heaven rest  And singing in their branches nest  He waters from his clouds the hills  The teeming earth with plenty fills  He grass for cattle doth produce  And every herb for human use  That so he may his creatures feed  And from the earth supply their need  He makes the clusters of the vine  To glad the sons of men with wine  He oil to clear the face imparts  And bread the strength'ner of their hearts  The trees which God for fruit decreed  Nor sap nor moistning virtue need  The lofty cedars by his hand  In Lebanon implanted stand  Unto the birds these shelter yield  And storks upon the firtrees build  Wild goats the hills defend and feed  And in the rocks the conies breed  He makes the changing moon appear  To note the seasons of the year  The sun from him his strength doth get  And knows the measure of his set  Thou mak'st the darkness of the night  When beasts creep forth that shun the light  Young lions roaring after prey  From God their hunger must allay  When the bright sun casts forth his ray  Down in their dens themselves they lay  Man's labour with the morn begun  Continues till the day be done  O Lord what wonders hast thou made  In providence and wisdom laid  The earth is with thy riches crown'd  And seas where creatures most abound  There go the ships which swiftly fly  There great Leviathan doth lye  Who takes his pastime in the flood  All these do wait on thee for food  Thy bounty is on them distill'd  Who are by thee with goodness fill'd  But when thou hid'st thy face they die  And to their dust returned lie  Thy spirit all with life endues  The springing face of earth renews  God's glory ever shall endure  Pleas'd in his works from change secure  Upon the earth he looketh down  Which shrinks and trembles at his frown  His lightnings touch or thunders stroak  Will make the proudest mountains smoak  To him my ditties whilst I live  Or being have shall praises give  My meditations will be sweet  When fixt on him my comforts meet  Upon the earth let sinners rot  In place and memory forgot  But thou my soul thy maker bless  Let all the world his praise express  PHILIP MASSINGER  A POET of no small eminence was son of Mr Philip Massinger a gentleman belonging to the earl of Montgomery in whose service he lived  Langb  ine's Lives of the Poets    He was born at Salisbury about the year and was entered a commoner in St Alban's Hail in Oxford where though he was encouraged in his studies says Mr Wood by the earl of Pembroke yet he applied his mind more to poetry and romances than to logic and philosophy He afterwards quitted the university without a degree and being impatient to move in a public sphere he came to London in order to improve his poetic fancy and polite studies by conversation and reading the world He soon applied himself to the stage and wrote several tragedies and comedies with applause which were admired for the purity of their f  ile and the oeconomy of their plots he was held in the highest esteem by the poets of that age and there were few who did not rockon it an honour to write in conjunction with him as Fletcher Middleton Rowley Field and Decker did  Langbaine ubi supra  He is said to have been a man of great modesty He died suddenly at his house on the ba  k side in So  thwark near to the then playhouse for he went to bed well and was dead before morning His body was interred in St Saviour's  churchyard and was attended to the grave by all the comedians then in town on the th of March Sir Aston Cokain has an epitaph on Mr John Fletcher and Mr Philip Massinger who as he says both lie buried in one grave He prepared several works for the public and wrote a little book against Scaliger which many have ascribed to Scioppius the supposed author of which Scaliger use with great contempt Our author has published plays of his own writing besides those in which he joined with other poets of which the following is the list  The Bashful Lover a TragiComedy often acted at a private house in Black Fryars by his Majesty's Servants with success printed in vo  The Bondman an ancient Story often acted at

Servants at the Globe printed at London This old Tragedy as the author tells his patron has neither Prologue nor Epilogue  "it being composed at a time when such byornaments were not advanced above

of the English Benedictines at Doway in Handers but being born with a poetical turn and consequently too volatile to be confined within the walls of a cloister he threw off the restraint of his education quitted a recluse life came over to England and commenced Protestant  Wood's Fasti vol ii p  Sir Robert having good interest found the change of religion p  epared the way to preferment he was made gentleman usher of the privy chamber to King Charles II then Prince of Wales we find him afterwards adhering to the interest of his Royal Master for when his Majesty was driven out of London by the threatnings and tumults of the discontented rabble he followed him and on the th of September he received the honour of knighthood After the battle of Edgehill when his Majesty was obliged to re  ire to Oxford our author then attended him and was created Dr of the civil laws When the Royal cause declined Stapleton thought proper to addict himself to study and to live quietly under a government no effort of his could overturn and as he was not amongst the most conspic  ous of the Royalists he was suffered to enjoy his  solitude unmolested At the restoration he was again promoted in the service of King Charles II and held a place in that monarch's esteem 'till his death Langbaine speaking of this gentleman gives him a very great character his writings says he have made him not only known but admired throughout all England and while Musaeus and Juvenal are in esteem with the learned Sir Robert's fame will still survive the translation of these two authors having placed his name in the temple of Immortality As to Musaeus he had so great a value for him that after he had translated him he reduced the story into a dramatic poem called Hero and Leander a Tragedy printed in to and addressed to the Duchess of Monmouth Whether this play was ever acted is uncertain though the Prologue and Epilogue seem to imply that it appeared on the stage  Besides these translations and

Westminster He was uncle to Dr Miles Stapleton of Yorkshire younger brother to Dr Stapleton a Benedictine Monk who was president of the English Benedictines at Delaware in Lorraine where he died  Dr JASPER MAIN  THIS poet was born at Hatherleigh in the reign of King James I He was a man of reputation as well for his natural parts as his acquired accomplishments He received his education at Westminster school where he continued 'till he was removed to Christ Church Oxon and in the year admitted student He made some figure at the university in the study of arts and sciences and was sollicited by men of eminence who esteemed him for his abilities to enter into holy orders this he was not long in complying with and was preferred to two livings both in the gift of the College one of which was happily situated near Oxford  Much about this time King Charles I was obliged to keep his court at Oxford to avoid being exposed to the resentment of the populace in London where tumults then prevailed and Mr Main was made choice of amongst others to preach before  his Majesty Soon after he was created doctor of divinity and resided at Oxford till the time of the mock visitation sent to the university when amongst a great many others equally distinguished for their loyalty and zeal for that unfortunate Monarch he was ejected from the college and stript of both his livings During the rage of the civil war he was patronized by the earl of Devonshire at whose house he resided till the restoration of Charles II when he was not only put in possession of his former places but made canon of Christ's Church and archdeacon of Chichester which preferments he enjoyed till his death He was an orthodox preacher a man of severe virtue a ready and facetious wit In his younger years he addicted himself to poetry and produced two plays which were held in some esteem in his own time but as they have never been revived nor taken notice of by any of our critics in all probability they are but second rate performances  The Amorous War a Tragedy printed in to Oxon  The City Match a Comedy acted before the King and Queen in Whitehall and afterwards on the stage in Black Fryars with great applause and printed in to Oxon  These two plays have been printed in folio to and vo and are bound together  Besides these dramatic pieces our author wrote a Poem upon the Naval Victory over the Dutch by the Duke of York a subject which Dryden has likewise celebrated in his Annus Mirabilis He published a translation of part of Lucian said to be done by Mr Francis Hicks to which he added some dialogues of his own though Winstanley is of opinion that the whole translation is also his  In the year he published several sermons and entered into a controversy with the famous Presbyterian leader Mr Francis Cheynel and his Sermon against False Prophets was particularly levelled at him Cheynel's Life is written by a gentleman of great eminence in litera  ure and published in some of the latter numbers of of the Student in which the character of that celebrated teacher is fully displayed Dr Main likewise published in the year a book called The People's War examined according to the Principles of Scriptere and Reason which he wrote at the desire of a person of quality He also translated Dr Donne's Latin Epigrams into English and published them under the title of A Sheaf of Epigrams  On the th of December he died and his remains were deposited on the North side of the choir in Christ's Church In his will he left several legacies for pious uses fifty pounds for the rebuilding of St Paul's a hundred pounds to be distribu  ed by the two vicars of Cassington and Berton fo  the use of the poor in those parishes with many  ther legacies  He was a man of a very singular turn of humour and t  ough without the abilities bore some resemblance to the famous dean of St Patrick's and perh  ps was not so subject to those capricious whi  which produced so much uneasiness to all who attended upon dean Swift It is said of Dr Main that his propension to innocent raillery was so great that it kept him company even after death Among other legacies he bequeathed to an old servant an old trank and somewhat in it as he said that would make him drink no sooner did the Dr expire than the servant full of expectation visited the trunk in hopes of finding some money or other treasure lest him by his  master and to his great disappointment the legacy with which he had filled his imagination proved no other than a Red Herring  The ecclesiastical works of our author are as follow  A Sermon concerning Unity and Agreement preached at Carfax Church in Oxford August Cor i  A Sermon against False Prophets preached in St Mary's Church in Oxford shortly after the furrender of that garrison printed in Ezek xxii He afterwards published a Vindication of this Sermon from the aspersions of Mr Cheynel  A Sermon preached at the Consecration of the Right Reverend Father in God Herbert Lord Bishop of Hereford Tim iv  Concio ad Academiam Oxoniensem pro more habita inchoante Jermino Maii  As a specimen of his poetry we present a copy of verses addressed to Ben

competition with antiquity with regard to the sublime excellencies of poetry Greece could boast an Euripides Eschylus Sophocles and Sappho England was proud of her Shakespear Spenser Johnson and Fletcher but then the ancients had still a poet in reserve superior to the rest who stood unrivalled by all succeeding times and in epic poetry which is justly esteemed the highest effort of genius Homer had no rival When Milton appeared the pride of Greece was humbled the competition became more equal and since Paradise Lost is ours it would perhaps be an injury to our national fame to yield the palm to any state whether ancient or modern  The author of this astonishing work had something very singular in his life as if he had been marked out by Heaven to be the wonder of every age in all points of view in which he can be considered He lived in the times of general confusion he was engaged in the factions of state and the cause he thought proper to espouse he maintained  with unshaken firmness he struggled to the last for what he was persuaded were the rights of humanity he had a passion for civil liberty and he embarked in the support of it heedless of every consideration of danger he exposed his fortune to the vicissitudes of party contention and he exerted his genius in writing for the cause he favoured  There is no life to which it is more difficult to do justice and at the same time avoid giving offence than Milton's there are some who have considered him as a regicide others have extolled him as a patriot and a friend to mankind Partyrage seldom knows any bounds and differing factions have praised or blamed him according to their principles of religion and political opinions  In the course of this life a dispassionate regard to truth and an inviolable candour shall be observed Milton was not without a share of those failings which are inseparable from human nature those errors sometimes exposed him to censure and they ought not to pass unnoticed on the other hand the apparent sincerity of his intentions and the amazing force of his genius naturally produce an extream tenderness for the faults with which his life is chequered and as in any man's conduct fewer errors are seldom found so no man's parts ever gave him a greater right to indulgence  The author of Paradise Lost was descended of an ancient family of that name at Milton near Abingdon in Oxfordshire He was the son of John Milton a moneyscrivener and born the th of December The family from which he descended had been long seated there as appears by the monuments still to be seen in the church of Milton 'till one of them having taken the unfortunate side in the contests between the houses of York and Lancaster was deprived of all his estate except  what he held by his wife  Philips's Life of Milton p Preface prefixed to the English Translation of his Letters of State  Our author's grandfather whose name was John Milton was underranger or reaper of the forest of Shotover near Halton in Oxfordshire but a man of Milton's genius needs not have the circumstance of birth called in to render him illustrious he reflects the highest honour upon his family which receives from him more glory than the longest descent of years can give Milton was both ed  cated under a domestic tutor and likewise at St Paul's school under Mr Alexander Gill where he made by his indefatigable application an extraordinary progress in learning From his th year he generally sat up all night at his studies which accompanied with frequent headaches proved very prejudicial to his eyes In the year he was entered into Christ's College in Cambridge under the tuition of Mr William Chappel afterwards bishop of Ross in Ireland and even before that time had distinguished himself by several Latin and English poems  Birch's Critical Account of Milton's Life and Writings  After he had taken the degree of master of arts in he left the university and for the space of five years lived with his parents at their house at Horton near Colebrook in Buckinghamshire where his father having acquired a competent fortune thought proper to retire and spend the remainder of his days In the year he wrote his Masque of Comus performed at Ludlow Castle before John earl of Bridgwater then president of Wales It appears from the edition of this Masque published by Mr Henry Lawes that the principal performers were the Lord Barclay Mr Thomas Egerton the Lady Alice Egerton and Mr Lawes himself who represented an attendant spirit  The Prologue which we found in the General Dictionary begins with the following lines  Our stedfast bard to his own genius true  Still bad his muse sit audience find tho' few  Scorning the judgment of a trifling age  To choicer spirits he bequeath'd his page  He too was scorned and to Britannia's shame  She scarce for half an age knew Milton's name  But now his fame by every trumpet blown  We on his deathless trophies raise our own  Nor art nor nature could his genius bound  Heaven hell earth chaos he survey'd around  All things his eye thro' wit's bright empire thrown  Beheld and made what it beheld his own  In our author published his Lycidas in this poem he laments the death of his friend Mr Edward King who was drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish seas in it was printed the year following at Cambridge in to in a collection of Latin and English poems upon Mr King's death with whom he had contracted the strongest friendship The Latin epitaph informs us that Mr King was son of Sir John King secretary for Ireland to Queen Elizabeth James I and Charles I and that he was fellow in Christ'sCollege Cambridge and was drowned in the twentyfifth year of his age But this poem of Lycidas does not altogether consist in elegiac strains of tenderness there is in it a mixture of satire and severe indignation for in part of it he takes occasion to rally the corruptions of the established clergy of whom he was no favourer and first discovers his acrimony against archbishop Laud he threatens him with the loss of his head a fate which he afterwards met thro' the fury of his enemies at least says Dr Newton I can think of no sense so proper to be given to the following verses in Lycidas  Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw  Daily devours apace and nothing said  But that twohanded engine at the door  Stands ready to smite once and smite no more  Upon the death of his mother Milton obtained leave of his father to travel and having waited upon Sir Henry Wotton formerly ambassador at Venice and then provost of EatonCollege to whom he communicated his design that gentleman wrote a letter to him dated from the College April and printed among the Reliquiae Wottonianae and in Dr Newton's life of Milton Immediat  ly after the receipt of this letter our author set out for France accompanied only with one man who attended him thro' all his travels At Paris Milton was introduced to the famous Hugo Grotius and thence went to Florence Siena Rome and Naples in all which places he was entertained with the utmost civility by persons of the first distinction  When our author was at Naples he was introduced to the acquaintance of Giovanni Baptista Manso Marquis of Villa a Neapolitan nobleman celebrated for his taste in the liberal arts to whom Tasso addresses his dialogue on friendship and whom he likewise mentions in his Gierusalemme liberata with great honour This nobleman shewed extraordinary civilities to Milton frequently visited him at his lodgings and accompanied him when he went to see the several curiosities of the city He was not content with giving our author these exterior marks of respect only but he honoured him by a Latin distich in his praise which is printed before Milton's Latin poems Milton no doubt was highly pleased with such extreme condescension and esteem from a person of the Marquis of  Villa's quality and as an evidence of his gratitude he presented the Marquis at his departure from Naples his eclogue entitled Mansus which says Dr Newton is well worth reading among his Latin poems so that it may be reckoned a peculiar felicity in the Marquis of Villa's life to have been celebrated both by Tasso and Milton the greatest poets of their nation Having seen the finest parts of Italy and conversed with men of the first distinction he was preparing to pass over into Sicily and Greece when the news from England that a civil war was like to lay his country in blood diverted his purpose for as by his education and principles he was attached to the parliamentary interest he though it a mark of abject cowardice for a lover of his country to take his pleasure abroad while the friends of liberty were contending at home for the rights of human nature He resolved therefore to return by way of Rome tho' he was dissuaded from pursuing that resolution by the merchants who were informed by their correspondents that the English jesuits there were forming plots against his life in case he should return thither on account of the great freedom with which he had treated their religion and the boldness he discovered in demonstrating the absurdity of the Popish tenets for he by no means observed the rule recommended to him by Sir Henry Wotton of keeping his thoughts close and his countenance open Milton was removed above dissimulation he hated whatever had the appearance of disguise and being naturally a man of undaunted courage he was never afraid to assert his opinions nor to vindicate truth tho' violated by the suffrage of the majority  Stedfast in his resolutions he went to Rome a second time and stayed there two months more neither concealing his name nor declining any  disputations to which his antagonists in religious opinions invited him he escaped the secret machinations of the jesuits and came safe to Florence where he was received by his friends with as much tenderness as if he had returned to his own country Here he remained two months as he had done in his former visit excepting only an excursion of a few days to Lucca and then crossing the Appenine and passing thro' Bologna and Ferrara he arrived at Venice in which city he spent a month and having shipped off the books he had collected in his travels he took his course thro' Verona Milan and along the Lake Leman to Geneva In this city he continued some time meeting there with people of his own principles and contracted an intimate friendship with Giovanni Deodati the most learned professor of Divinity whose annotations on the bible are published in English and from thence returning to France the same way that he had gone before he arrived safe in England after an absence of fifteen months in which Milton had seen much of the world read the characters of famous men examined the policy of different countries and made more extensive improvements than travellers of an inferior genius and less penetration can be supposed to do in double the time Soon after his return he took a handsome house in Aldersgatestreet and undertook the education of his sister's two sons upon a plan of his own In this kind of scholastic solitude he continued some time but he was not so much immersed in academical studies as to stand an indifferent spectator of what was acted upon the public theatre of his country The nation was in great ferment in and the clamour against episcopacy running very high Milton who discovered how much inferior in eloquence and learning the puritan teachers were to the bishops  engaged warmly with the former in support of the common cause and exercised all the power of which he was capable in endeavouring to overthrow the prelatical establishment and accordingly published five tracts relating to church government they were all printed at London in to The first was intitled Reformation touching Church Discipline in England and the Causes that have hitherto hindered it two books written to a friend The second was of Prelatical Episcopacy and whether it may be deduced from Apostolical Times by virtue of those Testimonies which are alledged to that purpose in some late treatises one whereof goes under the name of James Usher archbishop of Armagh The third was the Reason of Church Government urged against the Prelacy by Mr John Milton in two books The fourth was Animadversions upon the Remonstrants Defence against Smectymnuus and the fifth an Apology for a Pamphlet called a Modest Confutation of the Animadversions upon the Remonstrants against Smectymnuus or as the title page is in some copies an Apology for Smectymnuus with the Reason of Church Government by John Milton  In the year Milton married the daughter of Richard Powel  Esq  of Forresthill in Oxfordshire who not long after obtaining leave of her husband to pay a visit to her father in the country but upon repeated messages to her refusing to return Milton seemed disposed to marry another and in published the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce the Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce and the year following his Tetrachordon and Colasterion Mr Philips observes and would have his readers believe that the reason of his wife's aversion to return to him was the contrariety of their state principles The lady being educated in loyal notions  possibly imagined that if ever the regal power should flourish again her being connected with a person so obnoxious to the King would hurt her father's interest this Mr Philips alledges but with submission to his authority I dissent from his opinion Had she been afraid of marrying a man of Milton's principles the reason was equally strong before as after marriage and her father must have seen it in that light but the true reason or at least a more rational one seems to be that she had no great affection for Milton's person  Milton was a stern man and as he was so much devoted to study he was perhaps too negligent in those endearments and tender intercourses of love which a wife has a right to expect No lady ever yet was fond of a scholar who could not join the lover with it and he who expects to secure the affections of his wife by the force of his understanding only will find himself miserably mistaken indeed it is no wonder that women who are formed for tenderness and whose highest excellence is delicacy should pay no great reverence to a proud scholar who considers the endearments of his wife and the caresses of his children as pleasures unworthy of him It is agreed by all the biographers of Milton that he was not very tender in his disposition he was rather boldly honourable than delicately kind and Mr Dryden seems to insinuate that he was not much subject to love  "His rhimes says he flow stiff from him and that too at an age when love makes every man a rhymster tho' not a poet There are methinks in Milton's lovesonnets more of art than nature he seems to have considered the passion philosophically rather than felt it intimately"  In reading Milton's gallantry the breast will glow but feel no palpitations we admire the poetry  but do not melt with tenderness and want of feeling in an author seldom fails to leave the reader cold but from whatever cause his aversion proceeded she was at last prevailed upon by her relations who could foresee the dangers of a matrimonial quarrel to make a submission and she was again received with tenderness  Mr Philips has thus related the story  'It was then generally thought says he that Milton had a design of marrying one of Dr Davy's daughters a very handsome and witty gentlewoman but averse as it is said to this motion however the intelligence of this caused justice Powel's family to set all engines at work to restore the married woman to the station in which they a little before had planted her At last this device was pitched upon There dwelt in the lane of St Martin's Le Grand which was hard by a relation of our author's one Blackborough whom it was known he often visited and upon this occasion the visits were more narrowly observed and possibly there might be a combination between both parties the friends on both sides consenting in the same action tho' in different behalfs One time above the rest making his usual visits his wife was ready in another room on a sudden he was surprized to see one whom he thought never to have seen more making submission and begging pardon on her knees before him He might probably at first make some shew of aversion and rejection but partly his own generous nature more inclinable to reconciliation than to perseverance in anger and revenge and partly the strong intercession of friends on both sides soon brought him to an act of oblivion and a firm league of peace for the future and it was at length concluded that she should remain at a  friend's house till he was settled in his new house in Barbican and all things prepared for her reception The first fruits of her return to her husband was a brave girl born within a year after tho' whether by ill constitution or want of care she grew more and more decrepit'  Mr Fenton observes that it is not to be doubted but the abovementioned interview between Milton and his wife must wonderfully affect him and that perhaps the impressions it made on his imagination contributed much to the painting of that pathetic scene in Paradise Lost b in which Eve addresses herself to Adam for pardon and peace now at his feet submissive in distress  About the year our author wrote a small piece in one sheet to under this title Education to Mr Samuel Hartly reprinted at the end of his Poems on several occasions and in the same year he published at London in to his Areopagitica or a speech of Mr J Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England  In his Juvenile Poems were printed at London and about this time his zeal for the republican party had so far recommended him that a design was formed of making him adjutantgeneral in Sir William Waller's army but the new modelling the army proved an obstruction to that advancement Soon after the march of Fairfax and Cromwell with the whole army through the city in order to suppress the insurrection which Brown and Massey were endeavouring to raise there against the army's proceedings he left his great house in Barbican for a smaller in High Holborn where he prosecuted his studies till after the King's trial and death when he published his Tenure of Kings  and Magistrates His Observations on the Articles of peace between James Earl of Ormond for King Charles I on the one hand and the Irish Rebels and Papists on the other hand and a letter sent by Ormond to colonel Jones governor of Dublin and a representation of the Scotch Presbytery at Belfast in Ireland  He was now admitted into the service of the Commonwealth and was made Latin Secretary to the Council of State who resolved neither to write nor receive letters but in the Latin tongue which was common to all states  And it were to be wished  'says Dr Newton that succeeding Princes would follow their example for in the opinion of very wise men the universality of the French language will make way for the universality of the French Monarchy Milton was perhaps the first instance of a blind man's possessing the place of a secretary which no doubt was a great inconvenience to him in his business tho' sometimes a political use might be made of it as men's natural infirmities are often pleaded in excuse for their not doing what they have no great inclination to do Dr Newton relates an instance of this When Cromwell as we may collect from Whitlocke for some reasons delayed artfully to sign the treaty concluded with Sweden and the Swedish ambassador made frequent complaints of it it was excused to him because Milton on account of his blindness proceeded slower in business and had not yet put the articles of treaty into Latin Upon which the ambassador was greatly surprized that things of such consequence should be entrusted to a blind man for he must necessarily employ an amanuensis and that amanuensis might divulge the articles and said it was very wonderful there should be only one man in  England who could write Latin and he a blind one'  Thus we have seen Milton raised to the dignity of Latin Secretary It is somewhat strange that in times of general confusion when a man of parts has the fairest opportunity to play off his abilities to advantage that Milton did not rise sooner nor to a greater elevation he was employed by those in authority only as a writer which conferred no power upon him and kept him in a kind of obscurity who had from nature all that was proper for the field as well as the cabinet for we are assured that Milton was a man of confirmed courage  In our author published his Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio for which he was rewarded by the Commonwealth with a present of a thousand pounds and had a considerable hand in correcting and polishing a piece written by his nephew Mr John Philips and printed at London under this title Joannis Philippi Angli Responfio ad Apologiam Anonymi cujusdam Tenebrionis pro Rege Populo Anglicano infantissimam During the writing and publishing this book he lodged at one Thomson's next door to the Bullhead tavern CharingCross but he soon removed to a Gardenhouse in PettyFrance next door to lord Scudamore's where he remained from the year till within a few weeks of the Restoration In this house his first wife dying in childbed he married a second Catherine the daughter of Captain Woodcock of Hackney who died of a consumption in three months after she had been brought to bed of a daughter This second marriage was about two or three years after he had been wholly deprived of his sight for by reason of his continual studies and the headach to which he was subject from his youth and his perpetual tampering with physic  his eyes had been decaying for twelve years before  In he published his Defensio Secunda and the year following his Defensio pro Se Being now at ease from his state adversaries and political controversies he had leisure again to prosecute his own studies and private designs particularly his History of Britain and his new Thesaurus Linguae Latinae according to the method of Robert Stevens the manuscript of which contained three large volumes in folio and has been made use of by the editors of the Cambridge Dictionary printed to  In he published Sir Walter Raleigh's CabinetCouncil and in a Treatise of the Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes Lond mo and Considerations touching the likeliest Means to remove Hirelings out of the Church wherein are also Discourses of Tithes Churchfees ChurchRevenues and whether any Maintenance of Ministers can be settled in Law Lond mo  Upon the dissolution of the Parliament by the army after Richard Cromwell had been obliged to resign the Protectorship Milton wrote a letter in which he lays down the model of a commonwealth not such as he judged the best but what might be the readiest settled at that time to prevent the restoration of kingly government and domestic disorders till a more favourable season and better dispositions for erecting a perfect democracy He drew up likewise another piece to the same purpose which seems to have been addressed to general Monk and he published in February his ready and easy way to establish a free Commonwealth Soon after this he published his brief notes upon a late sermon entitled the Fear of God and the King printed in to Lond Just before the restoration he was removed from his office  of Latin secretary and concealed himself till the act of oblivion was published by the advice of his friends he absconded till the event of public affairs should direct him what course to take for this purpose he retired to a friend's house in BartholomewClose near WestSmithfield till the general amnesty was delared  The act of oblivion says Mr Phillips proving as favourable to him as could be hoped or expected through the intercession of some that stood his friends both in Council and Parliament particularly in the House of Commons Mr Andrew Marvel member for Hull and who has prefixed a copy of verses before his Paradise Lost acted vigorously in his behalf and made a considerable party for him so that together with John Goodwin of ColemanStreet he was only so far excepted as not to bear any office in the Commonwealth but as this is one of the most important circumstances in the life of our author we shall give an account of it at large from Mr Richardson in his life of Milton prefixed to his Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Paradise Lost  His words are  'That Milton escaped is well known but not how By the accounts we have he was by the Act of Indemnity only incapacitated for any public employment This is a notorious mistake though Toland the bishop of Sarum Fenton c have gone into it confounding him with Goodwin their cases were very different as I found upon enquiry Not to take a matter of this importance upon trust I had first recourse to the Act itself Milton is not among the excepted If he was so conditionally pardoned it must then be by a particular instrument That  could not be after he had been purified entirely by the general indemnity nor was it likely the King who had declared from Breda he would pardon all but whom the Parliament should judge unworthy of it and had thus lodged the matter with them should before they came to a determination bestow a private act of indulgence to one so notorious as Milton It is true Rapin says several principal republicans applied for mercy while the Act was yet depending but quotes no authority and upon search no such pardon appears on record though many are two or three years after but then they are without restrictions some people were willing to have a particular as well as a general pardon but whatever was the case of others there was a reason besides what has been already noted that no such favour would be shewn to Milton The House of Commons June vote the King to be moved to call in his two books and that of John Goodwin written in justification of the murder of the King in order to be burnt and that the Attorney General do proceed against them by indictment June an Order of Council reciting that Vote of the th and that the persons were not to be found directs a Proclamation for calling in Milton's two books which are here explained to be that against Salmasius and the Eikon Basilike as also Goodwin's book and a Proclamation was issued accordingly and another to the same purpose the th of August as for Goodwin he narrowly escaped for his life but he was voted to be excepted out of the Act of Indemnity amongst the twenty designed to have penalties inflicted short of death and August these books of Milton and Goodwin were burnt by the hangman The Act of Oblivion according to Kennet's Register was passed the th It is seen by this account that Milton's  person and Goodwin's are separated tho' their books are blended together As the King's intention appeared to be a pardon to all but actual regicides as Burnet says it is odd he should assert in the same breath almost all people were surprized that Goodwin and Milton escaped censure Why should it be so strange they being not concerned in the King's blood that he was forgot as Toland says some people imagined is very unlikely However it is certain from what has been shewn from bishop Kennet he was not That he should be distinguished from Goodwin with advantage will justly appear strange for his vast merit as an honest man a great scholar and a most excellent writer and his same on that account will hardly be thought the causes especially when it is remembered Paradise Lost was not produced and the writings on which his vast reputation stood are now become criminal and those most which were the main pillars of his fame Goodwin was an inconsiderable offender compared with him some secret cause must be recurred to in accounting for this indulgence I have heard that secretary Morrice and Sir Thomas Clarges were his friends and managed matters artfully in his favour doubtless they or some body else did and they very probably as being powerful friends at that time But still how came they to put their interest at such a stretch in favour of a man so notoriously obnoxious perplexed and inquisitive as I was I at length found the secret It was Sir William Davenant obtained his remission in return of his own life procured by Milton's interest when himself was under condemnation Anno A life was owing to Milton Davenant's and it was paid nobly Milton's for Davenant at Davenant's intercession The management of the affair in the house whether  by signifying the King's desire or otherwise was perhaps by those gentlemen named'  This account Mr Richardson had from Mr Pope who was informed of it by Betterton the celebrated actor who was first brought upon the stage by Sir William Davenant and honoured with an intimacy with him so that no better authority need be produced to support any fact  Milton being secured by his pardon appeared again in public and removed to Jewinstreet where he married his third wife Elizabeth the daughter of Mr Minshul of Cheshire recommended to him by his friend Dr Paget to whom he was relat  d but he had no children by her soon after the restoration he was offered the place of Latin secretary to the King which notwithstanding the importunities of his wife he refused we are informed that when his wife pressed him to comply with the times and accept the King's offer he made answer  'You are in the right my dear you as other women would ride in your coach for me my aim is to live and die an honest man'  Soon after his marriage with his third wife he removed to a house in the Artillery Walk leading to Bunhillfields where he continued till his death exc  pt during the plague in when he retired with his family to St Giles's Chalfont Buckinghamshire at which time his Paradise Lost was finished tho' not published till Mr Philips observes that the subject of that poem was first designed for a tragedy and in the fourth book of the poem says he there are ten verses which several years before the poem was begun were shewn to me and some others as designed for the very beginning of the tragedy The verses are  O thou that with surpassing glory crown'd  Look'st from thy sole dominion like the god  Of this new world at whose sight all the stars  Hide their diminish'd heads to thee I call  But with no friendly voice and add thy name  O Sun to tell thee how I hate thy beams  Which brings to my remembrance from what state  I fell how glorious once above thy sphere  'Till pride and worse ambition threw me down  Warring in Heaven 'gainst Heav'ns matchlefs King  Mr Philips further observes that there was a very remarkable circumstance in the composure of Paradise Lost which says he  'I have particular reason to remember for whereas I had the perusal of it from the very beginning for some years as I went from time to time to visit him in a parcel of ten twenty or thirty verses at a time which being written by whatever hand came next might possibly want correction as to the orthography and pointing having as the summer came on not been shewn any for a considerable while and desiring the reason thereof was answered that his vein never happily slowed but from the autumnal equinox to the vernal and that whatever he attempted at other times was never to his satisfaction though he courted his fancy never so much so that in all the years he was about his poem he may be said to have spent but half his time therein  Life of Milton p  '  Mr Toland imagines that Mr Philips must be mistaken in regard to the time since Milton in his Latin Elegy upon the Approach of the Spring declares the contrary and that his poetic talent returned with the spring This is a point as it is not worth contending so it never can be settled no poet ever yet could tell when the poetic vein would flow and as no man can make verses unless the inclination be present so no man can  be certain how long it will continue for if there is any inspiration now amongst men it is that which the poet feels at least the sudden starts and flashes of fancy bear a strong resemblance to the idea we form of inspiration  Mr Richardson has informed us  'that when Milton dictated he used to sit leaning backwards obliquely in an easy chair with his legs flung over the elbows of it that he frequently composed lying abed in a morning and that when he could not sleep but lay awake whole nights he tried but not one verse could he make at other times slowed easy his unpremeditated verse with a certain Impetus as himself used to believe then at what hour soever he rung for his daughter to secure what came I have been also told he would dictate many perhaps lines in a breath and then reduce them to half the number'  I would not omit says Mr Richardson the least circumstance these indeed are trifles but even such contract a sort of greatness when related to what is great  After the work was ready for the press it was near being suppressed by the ignorance or malice of the licenser who among other trivial objections imagined there was treason in that noble simile b i v  As when the sun new ris'n  Looks thro' the horizontal misty air  Shorn of his beams or from behind the moon  In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds  On half the nations and with fear of change  Perplexes monarchs  The ignorance of this licenser in objecting to this noble simile has indeed perpetuated his name but it is with no advantage he no doubt imagined that  Perplexes Monarchs  was levelled against the reigning Prince which is perhaps the  highest simile in our language how ridiculously will people talk who are blinded by prejudice or heated by party But to return After Milton had finished this noble work of genius which does honour to human nature he disposed of it to a Bookseller for the small price of fifteen pounds under such prejudice did he then labour and the payment of the fifteen pounds was to depend upon the sale of two numerous impressions This engagement with his Bookseller proves him extremely ignorant of that sort of business for he might be well assured that if two impressions sold a great deal of money must be returned and how he could dispose of it thus conditionally for fifteen pounds appears strange but while it proves Milton's ignorance or inattention about his interest in this affair it at the same time demonstrates the Bookseller's honesty for he could not be ignorant what money would be got by two numerous editions After this great work was published however it lay some time in obscurity and had the Bookseller advanced the sum stipulated he would have had reason to repent of his bargain It was generally reported that the late lord Somers first gave Paradise Lost a reputation but Mr Richardson observes that it was known and esteemed long before there was such a man as lord Somers as appears by a pompous edition of it printed by subscription in where amongst the list of Subscribers are the names of lord Dorset Waller Dryden Sir Robert Howard Duke Creech Flatman Dr Aldrich Mr Atterbury Sir Roger L'Estrange lord Somers then only John Somers  Esq  Mr Richardson further informs us that he was told by Sir George Hungerford an ancient Member of Parliament that Sir John Denham came into the House one morning with a sheet of Paradise Lost wet from the press in his hand and being asked what he  was reading he answered part of the noblest poem that ever was written in any language or in any age however it is certain that the book was unknown till about two years after when the earl of Dorset recommended it as appears from the following story related to Mr Richardson by Dr Tancred Robinson an eminent physician in London who was informed by Sir Fleetwood Sheppard  'that the earl in company with that gentleman looking over some books in Little Britain met with Paradise Lost and being surprized with some passages in turning it over bought it The Bookseller desired his lordship to speak in its favour since he liked it as the impression lay on his hands as waste paper The earl having read the poem sent it to Mr Dryden who in a short time returned it with this answer This man cuts us all and the ancients too'  Critics have differed as to the source from which our drew the first hint of writing Paradise Lost Peek conjectures that it was from a celebrated Spanish Romance called Guzman and Dr Zachary Pearce now bishop of Bangor has alledged that he took the first hint of it from an Italian Tragedy called I  Paradiso Perso still extant and printed many years before he entered on his design Mr Lauder in his Essay on Milton's Use and Imitation of the Moderns has insinuated that Milton's first hint of Paradise Lost was taken from a Tragedy of the celebrated Grotius called Adamus Exul and that Milton has not thought it beneath him to transplant some of that author's beauties into his noble work as well as some other flowers called from the gardens of inferior genius's but by an elegance of art and force of nature peculiar to him he has drawn the admiration of the world upon passages which in their original authors stood neglected and undistinguished If at any time he has adopted a sentiment of a cotemporary poet  it deserves another name than plagiary for as Garth expresses it in the case of Dryden who was charged with plagiary that like ladies of quality who borrow beggars children it is only to cloath them the better and we know no higher compliment could have been paid to these moderns than that of Milton's doing them the honour to peruse them for like a Prince's accepting a present from a subject the glory is reflected on him who offers the gift not on the Monarch who accepts it But as Mr Lauder's book has lately made so great a noise in the world we must beg leave to be a little more particular  Had Mr Lauder pursued his plan of disclosing Milton's resources and tracing his steps through the vast tracts of erudition that our author travelled with candour and dispassionateness the design would have been noble and useful he then would have produced authors into light who were before unknown have recommended sacred poetry and it would have been extreamly pleasing to have followed Milton over all his classic ground and seen where the noblest genius of the world thought proper to pluck a flower and by what art he was able to rear upon the foundation of nature so magnificent so astonishing a fabric but in place of that Mr Lauder suffers himself to be overcome by his passion and instead of tracing him as a man of taste and extensive reading he hunts him like a malefactor and seems to be determined on his execution  Mr Lauder could never separate the idea of the author of Paradise Lost and the enemy of King Charles Lauder has great reading but greater ill nature and Mr Douglas has shewn how much his evidence is invalidated by some interpolations which Lauder has since owned It is pity so much classical knowledge should have been thus prostituted by  Lauder which might have been of service to his country but partyzeal seldom knows any bounds The ingenious Moses Brown speaking of this man's furious attack upon Milton has the following pretty stanza  The Owl will hoot that cannot sing  Spite will displume the muse's wing  Tho' Phoebus self applaud her  Still Homer bleeds in Zoilus' page  A Virgil 'scaped not the Maevius' rage  And Milton has his Lauder  Gentleman's Magazine  But if Lauder is hot and furious his passion soon subsides Upon hearing that the granddaughter of Milton was living in an obscure situation in Shoreditch he readily embraced the opportunity in his postscript of recommending her to the public favour upon which some gentlemen affected with the singularity of the circumstance and ashamed that our country should suffer the granddaughter of one from whom it derives its most lasting and brightest honour to languish neglected procured Milton's Comus to be performed for her benefit at Drury Lane on the th of April upon which Mr Garrick spoke a Prologue written by a gentleman who zealously promoted the benefit and who at this time holds the highest rank in literature  This prologue will not we are persuaded be unacceptable to our readers  A PROLOGUE spoken by Mr GARRICK Thursday April at the Representation of COMUS for the Benefit of Mrs ELIZABETH

now called England from the first traditional Beginning continued to the Norman Conquest collected out of the ancientest and best authors thereof It is reprinted in the first volume of Dr Kennet's compleat History of England Mr Toland in his Life of Milton page observes that we have not this history as it came out of his hands for the licensers those sworn officers to destroy learning liberty and good sense expunged several passages of it wherein he exposed the superstition pride and cunning of the Popish monks in the Saxon times but applied by the sagacious licensers to Charles IId's bishops In a considerable passage which had been suppressed in the publication of this history was printed at London in to under this title Mr John Milton's character of the Long Parliament and Assembly of Divines in omitted in his other works and never before printed It is reported and from the foregoing character it appears probable that Mr Milton had lent most of his personal estate upon the public faith which when he somewhat earnestly pressed to have restored after a long and chargeable attendance met with very sharp rebukes  upon which at last despairing of any success in this affair he was forced to return from them poor and friendless having spent all his money and wearied all those who espoused his cause and he had not probably mended his circumstances in those days but by performing such service for them as afterwards he did for which scarce any thing would appear too great In he published at London in vo Paradise Regained a Poem in four Books to which is added Sampson Agonistes there is not a stronger proof of human weakness than Milton's preferring this Poem of Paradise Regained to Paradise Lost and it is a natural and just observation that the Messiah in Paradise Regained with all his meekness unaffected dignity and clear reasoning makes not so great a figure as when in the Paradise Lost he appears cloathed in the Terrors of Almighty vengeance wielding the thunder of Heaven and riding along the sky in the chariot of power drawn as Milton greatly expresses it  'with Four Cherubic Shapes when he comes drest in awful Majesty and hurls the apostate spirits headlong into the fiery gulph of bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms'  Dr Newton has dissented from the general opinion of mankind concerning Paradise Regained  'Certainly says he it is very worthy of the author and contrary to what Mr Toland relates Milton may be seen in Paradise Regained as well as Paradise Lost if it is inferior in poetry I know not whether it is inferior in sentiment if it is less descriptive it is more argumentative if it does not sometimes rise so high neither doth it ever sink below and it has not met with the approbation it deserves only because it has not been more read and considered His subject indeed is confined and he has a narrow foundation  to build upon but he has raised as noble a superstructure as such little room and such scanty materials would allow The great beauty of it is the contrast between the two characters of the tempter and Our Saviour the artful sophistry and specious insinuations of the one refuted by the strong sense and manly eloquence of the other'  The first thought of Paradise Regained was owing to Elwood the Quaker as he himself relates the occasion in the History of his own Life When Milton had lent him the manuscript of Paradise Lost at St Giles's Chalfont and he returned it Milton asked him how he liked it and what he thought of it  'which I modestly and freely told him says Elwood and after some further discourse about it I pleasantly said to him'  'thou hast said much of Paradise Lost but what hast thou to say of a Paradise Found He made me no answer but sat some time in a muse then broke off that discourse and fell upon another subject'  When Elwood afterwards waited upon him in London Milton shewed him his Paradise Regained and in a pleasant tone said to him  'this is owing to you for you put it into my head by the question you put me at Chalfont which before I had not thought of'  In the year he published his Artis Logicae plenior Institutio ad Rami methodum concinnata London in vo and in a Discourse intitled Of True Religion Heresy Schism Toleration and what best Means may be used against the Growth of Popery London in to He published likewise the same year Poems c on several Occasions both English and Latin composed at several times with a small Tractate of Education to Mr Hartlib London vo In he published his Epistolarum familiarium lib i Prolusiones quaedam Oratoriae in Collegio Christi habitae London in vo and in the same year in  to a Declaration of the Letters Patent of the King of Poland John III elected on the d of May Anno Dom now faithfully translated from the Latin copy Mr Wood tells us  Fasti Oxon col  that Milton was thought to be the author of a piece called the Grand Case of Conscience concerning the Engagement Stated and Resolved or a Strict Survey of the Solemn League and Covenant in reference to the present Engagement but others are of opinion that the stile and manner of writing do not in the least favour that supposition His State Letters were printed at London in mo and translated into English and printed as his Brief History of Muscovy and of their less known Countries lying Eastward of Russia as far as Cathay was in in vo His Historical Poetical and Miscellaneous Works were printed in three volumes in folio at London though Amsterdam is mentioned in the title page with the life of the author by Mr Toland but the most compleat and elegant edition of his prose works was printed in two volumes in folio at London by the rev Mr Birch now secretary to the Royal Society with an Appendix concerning two Dissertations the first concerning the Author of the ΕΙΚΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΗ the Portraiture of his sacred Majesty in his solitude and sufferings and the prayer of Pamela subjoined to several editions of that book the second concerning the Commission said to be given by King Charles I in to the Irish Papists for taking up arms against the Protestants in Ireland In this edition the several pieces are disposed according to the order in which they were printed with the edition of a Latin Tract omitted by Mr Toland concerning the Reasons of the War with Spain in and several pages in the History of Great Britain expunged  by the licensers of the press and not to be met with in any former impressions It perhaps is not my province to make any remarks upon the two grand disputations that have subsisted between the friends and enemies of Charles I about the author of the Basilike and the Commission granted to the Irish Papists as to the last the reader if he pleases may consult at the Life of Lord Broghill in which he will find the mystery of iniquity disclosed and Charles entirely freed from the least appearance of being concerned in granting so execrable a commission the forgery is there fully related and there is all the evidence the nature of the thing will admit of that the King's memory has been injured by so base an imputation As to the first it is somewhat difficult to determine whether his Majesty was or was not the author of these pious Meditations Mr Birch has summed up the evidence on both sides we shall not take upon us to determine on which it preponderates it will be proper here to observe the chief evidence against the King in this contention is Dr Gauden bishop of Exeter who claimed that book as his and who in his letters to the earl of Clarendon values himself upon it and becomes troublesomely sollicitous for preferment on that account he likewise told the two princes that the Basilike was not written by their father but by him now one thing is clear that Gauden was altogether without parts his Life of Hooker which is the only genuine and indisputed work of his shews him a man of no extent of thinking his stile is loose and negligently florid which is diametrically opposite to that of these Meditations Another circumstance much invalidates his evidence and diminishes his reputation for honesty After he had for a considerable time professed himself a Protestant and been in possession of an English bishopric and discovered an ardent  desire of rising in the church notwithstanding this he declared himself at his death a Papist and upon the evidence of such a man none can determine a point in disputation for he who durst thus violate his conscience by the basest hypocrisy will surely make no great scruple to traduce the memory of his sovereign  In a work of Milton's called Icon Oclastes or the Image broken he takes occasion to charge the king with borrowing a prayer from Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia and placing it in his Meditations without acknowledging the favour Soon after the sentence of the Regicides had been put in execution these Meditations were published and as Anthony by shewing the body of murdered Caesar excited the compassion of multitudes and raised their indignation against the enemies of that illustrious Roman so these Meditations had much the same effect in England The Presbyterians loudly exclaimed against the murder of the King they asserted that his person was sacred and spilling his blood upon a scaffold was a stain upon the English annals which the latest time could not obliterate These tragical complaints gaining ground and the fury which was lately exercised against his Majesty subsiding into a tenderness for his memory heightened by the consideration of his piety which these Meditations served to revive it was thought proper in order to appease the minds of the people that an answer should be wrote to them  In this task Milton engaged and prosecuted it with vigour but the most enthusiastic admirer of that poet upon reading it will not fail to discover a spirit of bitterness an air of peevishness and resentment to run through the whole Milton has been charged with interpolating the prayer of Pamela into the King's Meditations by the assistance of Bradshaw who laid his commands upon  the printer so to do to blast the reputation of the King's book Dr Newton is of opinion that this fact is not well supported for it is related chiefly upon the authority of Henry Hills the printer who had frequently affirmed it to Dr Gill and Dr Bernard his physicians as they themselves have testified but tho' Hills was Cromwell's printer yet afterwards he turned Papist in the reign of King James II in order to be that King's Printer and it was at that time he used to relate this story so that little credit is due to his testimony It is almost impossible to believe Milton capable of such disingenuous meanness to serve so bad a purpose and there is as little reason for fixing it upon him as he had to traduce the King for profaning the duty of prayer with the polluted trash of romances for in the best books of devotion there are not many finer prayers and the King might as lawfully borrow and apply it to his own purpose as the apostle might make quotations from Heathen poems and plays and it became Milton the least of all men to bring such an accusation against the King as he was himself particularly fond of reading romances and has made use of them in some of the best and latest of his writings  There have been various conjectures concerning the cause that produced in Milton so great an aversion to Charles I One is that when Milton stood candidate for a professorship at Cambridge with his much esteemed friend Mr King their interest and qualifications were equal upon which his Majesty was required by his nomination to  ix the professor his answer was let the bestnatured man have it to which they who heard him immediately replied  'then we are certain it cannot be Milton's who was ever remarkable for a stern ungovernable man'  Whether  this conjecture is absolutely true we cannot determine but as it is not without probability it has a right to be believed till a more satisfactory one can be given  In whatever light Milton may be placed as a statesman yet as a poet he stands in one point of view without a rival the sublimity of his conceptions the elevation of his stile the fertility of his imagination and the conduct of his design in Paradise Lost is inimitable and cannot be enough admired  Milton's character as a poet was never better pourtray'd than in the epigram under his picture written by Mr Dryden  Three poets in three distant ages born  Greece Italy and England did adorn  The first in loftimess of thought surpass'd  The next in majesty in both the last  The force of nature could no further go  To make a third she join'd the former two  This great man died at his house at Bunhill Nov and was interred near the body of his father in the chancel of the church of St Giles Cripplegate By his first wife he had four children a son and three daughters The daughters survived their father Anne married a masterbuilder and died in childbed of her first child which died with her Mary lived single Deborah left her father when she was young and went over to Ireland with a lady and came to England again during the troubles of Ireland under King James II She married Mr Abraham Clark a weaver in Spittalfields and died Aug in the th year of age She had ten children viz seven sons and three daughters but none of them had any children except one of her sons named Caleb and the youngest daughter  whose name is Elizabeth Caleb went over to Fort St George in the EastIndies where he married and had two sons Abraham and Isaac of these Abraham the elder came to England with governor Harrison but returned again upon advice of his father's death and whether he or his brother be now living is uncertain Elizabeth the youngest child of Deborah married Mr Thomas Foster a weaver and lives now in Hoglane Shoreditch for whom Comus as we have already observed was performed at DruryLane and produced her a great benefit She has had seven children three sons and four daughters who are all now dead This Mrs Foster is a plain decent looking Woman Mr John Ward fellow of the Royal Society and professor of rhetoric in GreshamCollege London saw the above Mrs Clark Milton's daughter at the house of one of her relations not long before her death when she informed me says that gentleman  'That she and her sisters used to read to their father in eight languages which by practice they were capable of doing with great readiness and accuracy tho' they understood no language but English and their father used often to say in their hearing one tongue was enough for a woman None of them were ever sent to school but all taught at home by a mistress kept for that purpose Isaiah Homer and Ovid's Metamorphoses were books which they were often called to read to their father and at my desire she repeated a great number of verses from the beginning of both these poets with great readiness I knew who she was upon the first sight of her by the similitude of her countenance with her father's picture And upon my telling her so she informed me that Mr Addison told her the same thing on her going to wait on him for he upon hearing she was living sent for her and  desired if she had any papers of her father's she would bring them with her as an evidence of her being Milton's daughter but immediately on her being introduced to him he said Madam you need no other voucher your face is a sufficient testimonial whose daughter you are and he then made her a handsome present of a purse of guineas with a promise of procuring for her an annual provision for life but he dying soon after she lost the benefit of his generous design She appeared to be a woman of good sense and genteel behaviour and to bear the inconveniencies of a low fortune with decency and prudence'  Her late Majesty Queen Caroline sent her fifty pounds and she received presents of money from several gentlemen not long before her death Milton had a brother Mr Christopher Milton who was knighted and made one of the barons of the Exchequer in King James II's reign but he does not appear to have been a man of any abilities at least if he had any they are lost to posterity in the lustre of his brother's  There is now alive a granddaughter of this Christopher Milton who is married to one Mr John Lookup advocate at Edinburgh remarkable for his knowledge of the Hebrew tongue The lady whom I have often seen is extremely corpulent has in her youth been very handsome and is not destitute of a poetical genius She has writ several copies of verses published in the Edinburgh Magazines and her face bears some resemblance to the picture of Milton  Mr Wood and after him Mr Fenton has given us the following description of Milton's person  "He was of a moderate size wellproportioned and of a ruddy complexion light brown hair and had handsome features yet his eyes were none of the quickest When he was a student in Cambridge he was so fair and clear that many called him the Lady of Christ'sCollege His deportment was affable and his gait erect and manly bespeaking courage and undauntedness while he had his sight he wore a sword and was well skilled in using it He had a delicate tuneable voice an excellent ear could pay on the organ and bear a part in vocal and instrumental music  Fasti Oxon p Ed  "  The great learning and genius of Milton have scarcely raised him more admirers than the part he acted upon the political stage has procured him enemies He was in his inclination a thorough Republican and in this he thought like a Greek or Roman as he was very conversant with their writings And one day Sir Robert Howard who was a friend of Milton's and a well wisher to the liberty of his country asked him how he came to side with the Republicans Milton answered among other things  'Because theirs was the most frugal government for the trappings of a Monarchy might set up an ordinary Commonwealth'  But then his attachment to Cromwell must be condemned as being neither consistent with his republican principles nor with his love of liberty It may be reasonably presumed that he was far from entirely approving of Cromwell's proceeding but considered him as the only person who could rescue the nation from the tyranny of the Presbyterians who he saw were about to erect a worse dominion of their own upon the ruins of prelatical episcopacy for if experience may be  allowed to teach us the Presbyterian government carries in it more of ecclesiastical authority and approaches more to the thunder of the Vatican than any other government under the sun Milton was an enemy to spiritual slavery he thought the chains thrown upon the mind were the least tolerable and in order to shake the pillars of mental usurpation he closed with Cromwell and the independants as he expected under them greater liberty of conscience In matters of religion too Milton has likewise given great offence but insidels have no reason to glory No such man was ever amongst them He was persuaded of the truth of the christian religion he studied and admired the holy scriptures and in all his writings he plainly discovers a religious turn of mind  When he wrote the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce he appears to have been a Calvinist but afterwards he entertained a more favourable opinion of Arminius Some have thought that he was an Arian but there are more express passages in his works to overthrow this opinion than any there are to confirm it For in the conclusion of his Treatise on Reformation he thus sclemnly invokes the Trinity  'Thou therefore that sittest in light and glory unapproachable parent of angels and of men next thee I implore omnipotent king redeemer of that lost remnant whose nature thou didst assume ineffable and everlasting love and thee the third subsistence of the divine infinitude illuminating spirit the joy and solace of created things one tripersonal godhead'  In the latter part of his life he was not a professed member of any particular sect of christians he frequented no public worship nor used any religious  rite in his family he was an enemy to all kinds of forms and thought that all christians had in some things corrupted the simplicity and purity of the gospel He believed that inward religion was the best and that public communion had more of shew in it than any tendency to promote genuine piety and unaffected goodness  The circumstances of our author were never very mean nor very affluent he lived above want and was content with competency His father supported him during his travels When he was appointed Latin secretary his sallary amounted to l per ann and tho' he was of the victorious party yet he was far from sharing the spoils of his country On the contrary as we learn from his Second Defence he sustained great losses during the civil war and was not at all favoured in the imposition of taxes but sometimes paid beyond his due proportion and upon a turn of affairs he was not only deprived of his place but also lost l which he had for security put into the Excise office  In the fire of London his house in Breadstreet was burnt before which accident foreigners have gone out of devotion says Wood to see the house and chamber where he was born Some time before he died he sold the greatest part of his library as his heirs were not qualified to make a proper use of it and as he thought he could dispose of it to greater advantage than they could after his death He died says Dr Newton by one means or other worth l besides his houshold goods which was no incompetent subsistence for him who was as great a philosopher as a poet  Milton seems not to have been very happy in his marriages His first wife offended him by her elopement the second whose love sweetness and delicacy he celebrates lived not a  twelvemonth with him and his third was said to be a woman of a most violent spirit and a severe stepmother to his children  'She died says Dr Newton very old about twenty years ago at Nantwich in Cheshire and from the accounts of those who had seen her I have learned that she confirmed several things related before and particularly that her husband used to compose his poetry chiefly in the winter and on his waking on a morning would make her write down sometimes twenty or thirty verses Being asked whether he did not often read Homer and Virgil she understood it as an imputation upon him for stealing from these authors and answered with eagerness that he stole from no body but the muse that inspired him and being asked by a lady present who the muse was she answered it was God's grace and holy spirit that visited him nightly She was likewise asked whom he approved most of our English poets and answered Spenser Shakespear and Cowley and being asked what he thought of Dryden she said Dryden used sometimes to visit him but he thought him no poet but a good rhimist'  The reader will be pleased to observe that this censure of Milton's was before Dryden had made any great appearance in poetry or composed those immortal works of genius which have raised eternal monuments to him and carried his name to every country where poetry and taste are known Some have thought that Dryden's genius was even superior to Milton's That the latter chiefly shines in but one kind of poetry his thoughts are sublime and his language noble but in what kind of writing has not Dryden been distinguished He is in every thing excellent says Congreve and he has  attempted nothing in which he has not so succeeded as to be entitled to the first reputation from it  It is not to be supposed that Milton was governed by so mean a principle as envy in his thus censuring Dryden It is more natural to imagine that as he was himself no friend to rhime and finding Dryden in his early age peculiarly happy in the faculty of rhiming without having thrown out any thoughts which were in themselves distinguishedly great Milton might without the imputation of ill nature characterise Dryden as we have already seen  These are the most material incidents in the life of this great man who if he had less honour during the latter part of his life than he deserved it was owing to the unfavourable circumstances under which he laboured It is always unpleasing to a good man to find that they who have been distinguished for their parts have not been equally so for their moral qualities and in this case we may venture to assert that Milton was good as well as great and that if he was mistaken in his political principles he was honestly mistaken for he never deviated from his first resolution no temptations could excite him to temporise or to barter his honour for advantage nor did he ever once presume to partake of the spoils of his ruined country Such qualities as these are great in themselves and whoever possesses them has an unexceptionable claim to rank with the good  We might have entered more minutely into the merit of Milton's poems particularly the great work of Paradise Lost but we should reckon it arrogant as well as superfluous in us to criticise on a work whose beauties have been displayed by the hand of Mr Addison That critic has  illustrated the most remarkable passages in Paradise Lost such as are distinguished by their sublimity and elevation such whose excellence is propriety others raised by the nobleness of the language and those that are remarkable for energy and strong reasoning  A later critic the ingenious author of the Rambler has animadverted upon Milton's versification with great judgment and has discovered in some measure that happy art by which Milton has conducted so great a design with such astonishing success  From these two writers may be drawn all the necessary assistances for reading the Paradise Lost with taste and discernment and as their works are in almost in every body's hands it would be needless to give any abstract of them here  Mrs KATHERINE PHILIPS  THE celebrated Orinda was daughter of John Fowles of Bucklersbury a merchant in London She was born in the parish of St Mary WoolChurch Mr Aubrey tells us in a MS of his in Mr Ashmole's study No Vol that she had the early part of her education from her cousin Mrs Blacket At eight years old she was removed to a school at Hackney and soon made great improvements under the care of Mrs Salmon so great that whoever reads the account that Mr Aubrey gives of her at that time of her life will consider her succeeding progress to be no more than what might be naturally expected from such indications  of genius He tells us  'that she was very apt to learn and made verses when she was at school that she devoted herself to religious duties when she was very young that she would then pray by herself an hour together that she had read the bible through before she was full five years old that she could say by heart many chapters and passages of scripture was a frequent hearer of sermons which she would bring away entire in her memory'  The above is extracted from Mr Ballard's account of the Ladies of Great Britain who have been celebrated for their writings and serves to shew the early piety of this amiable lady who lived to be distinguished for her ripened understandingShe became afterwards a perfect mistress of the French tongue and learned the Italian under the tuition of her ingenious and worthy friend Sir Charles Cotterel She was instructed in the Presbyterian principles which it appears by her writings she deserted as soon as her reason was strong enough to exert itself in the examination of religious points She warmly embraced the royal interest and upon many occasions was a strenuous advocate for the authority of the established church  She was married to James Philips of the Priory of Cardigan  Esq  about the year By this gentleman she had one son who died in his infancy and one daughter married to a gentleman of Pembrokeshire She proved an excellent wife not only in the conjugal duties and tender offices of love but was highly serviceable to her husband in affairs in which few wives are thought capable of being useful for his fortune being much encumbered she exerted her interest with Sir Charles Cotterel and other persons of distinction who admired her understanding for she had few graces of person in her  husband's favour who soon extricated him from the difficulties under which he laboured It no where appears that the husband of Mrs Philips was a man of any abilities and if he met with respect in the world it was probably reflected from his wife This lady had too much piety and good sense to suffer her superior understanding to make her insolent on the other hand she always speaks of her husband with the utmost respect under the name of Antenor In a letter to Sir Charles Cotterel after having mentioned her husband in the most respectful terms and of his willingness to forward her journey to London in order to settle his perplexed affairs she adds  "And I hope God will enable me to answer his expectations by making me an instrument of doing some handsome service which is the only ambition I have in the world and which I would purchase with the hazard of my life I am extreamly obliged to my lady Cork for remembering me with so much indulgence for her great desire to be troubled with my company but above all for her readiness to assist my endeavours for Antenor which is the most generous kindness can be done me"  As this lady was born with a genius for poetry so she began early in life to improve it and composed many poems on various occasions for her amusement in her recess at Cardigan and retirement elsewhere These being dispersed among her friends and acquaintance were by an unknown hand collected together and published in vo without her knowledge or consent This accident is said to have proved so oppressive to our poetess as to throw her into a  it of illness and she pours out her complaints in a letter to Sir Charles Cotterel in which she laments in the most affecting manner the misfortune  and the injuries which had been done to her by this surreptitious edition of her Poems  That Mrs Philips might be displeased that her Poems were pablished without her consent is extremely probable as by these means they might appear without many graces and ornaments which they otherwise would have possessed but that it threw her into a sit of illness no body who reads the human heart can believe Surreptitious editions are a sort of compliment to the merit of an author and we are not to suppose Mrs Philips so much a saint as to be stlipt of all vanity or that natural delight which arises from the good opinion of others however aukwardly it may be discovered and we may venture to affirm that Mrs Philips's illness proceeded from some other cause than what is here assigned  The reputation of her abilities procured her the esteem of many persons of distinction and fashion and upon her going into Ireland with the viscountess of Duncannon to transact her husband's affairs there her great merit soon made her known to those illustrious peers Ormond Orrery and Roscommon and many other persons of the first fashion who shewed her singular marks of their esteem While Mrs Philips remained in that kingdom at the pressing importunity of the abovementioned noblemen but particularly lord Roscommon she translated from the French of Corneille the tragedy of Pompey which was brought upon the Irish stage somewhat against her inclination however it was several times acted in the new theatre there with very great applause in the years and in which last year it was made public It was afterwards acted with equal applause at the Duke of York's theatre This  play is dedicated to the Countess of Cork Lord Roscommon wrote the Prologue wherein he thus compliments the ladies and the translator  But you bright nymphs give Caesar leave to woo  The greatest wonder of the world but you  And hear a muse who has that hero taught  To speak as gen'rously as e'er he fought  Whose eloquence from s  ch a theme deters  All tongues but English and all pens but hers  By the just fates your sex is doubly blest  You conquer'd Caesar and you praise him best  She also translated from the French of Corneille a Tragedy called Horace Sir John Denham added a fifth Act to this Play which was acted at Court by Persons of Quality The Duke of Monmouth spoke the Prologue in which are these lines  So soft that to our shame we understand  They could not fall but from a lady's hand  Thus while a woman Horace did translate  Horace did rise above the name of fate  While Mrs Philips was in Ireland she was happy in carrying on her former intimacy with the famous Jeremy Taylor the bishop of Down and Connor who had some time before done her much honour by writing and publishing a Discourse on the Nature Offices and Measures of Friendship with Rules for conducting it in a letter addressed to her It is probable that this prelate's acquaintance with so accomplished a lady as Mrs Philips might be one reason of his entertaining so high an opinion of the fair sex in general it is certain he was a great admirer of them by which the good sense as well as piety of that great man is demonstrated for whoever has studied life examined the  various motives of human actions compared characters and in a word scrutinized the heart will find that more real virtue more genuine and unaffected goodness exist amongst the female sex than the other and were their minds cultivated with equal care and did they move in the bustle of life they would not fall short of the men in the acute excellences but the softness of their natures exempts them from action and the blushes of beauty are not to be effaced by the rough storms of adversity that man is happy who enjoys in the conjugal state the endearments of love and innocence and if his wife is less acquainted with the world than he she makes a large amends by the artless blandishments of a delicate affection  We are persuaded our fair readers will not be displeased if we insert a paragraph from the discourse already mentioned by this worthy churchman it appearing to be so sincere a tribute to their merit  'But by the way madam you may see how I differ from the majority of those cynics who would not admit your sex into the community of a noble friendship I believe some wives have been the best friends in the world and few stories can outdo the nobleness and piety of that lady that sucked the poisonous purulent matter from the wounds of the brave Prince in the holy land when an assassin had pierced him with a venomed arrow and if it be told that women cannot retain council and therefore can be no brave friends I can best confute them by the story of Porcia who being fearful of the weakness of her sex stabbed herself in the thigh to try how she could bear pain and finding herself constant enough to that sufferance gently chid her Brutus for not trusting her since now she perceived that no torment could wrest that secret from her which she hoped might be entrusted to her If  there were no more things to be said for your satisfaction I could have made it disputable which have been more illustrious in their friendship men or women I cannot say that women are capable of all those excellencies by which men can oblige the world and therefore a female friend in some cases is not so good a counsellor as a wise man and cannot so well defend my honour nor dispose of relief and assistances if she be under the power of another but a woman can love as passionately and converse as pleasantly and retain a secret as faithfully and be useful in her proper ministries and she can die for her friend as well as the bravest Roman knight a man is the best friend in trouble but a woman may be equal to him in the days of joy a woman can as well increase our comforts but cannot so well lessen our sorrows and therefore we do not carry women with us when we go to fight but in peaceful cities and times women are the beauties of society and the prettinesses of friendship and when we consider that few persons in the world have all those excellences by which friendship can be useful and illustrious we may as well allow women as men to be friends since they have all that can be necessary and essential to friendships and those cannot have all by which friendships can be accidentally improved'  Thus far this learned prelate whose testimony in favour of women is the more considerable as he cannot be supposed to have been influenced by any particular passion at least for Mrs Philips who was ordinary in her person and was besides a married lady In the year Mrs Philips quitted Ireland and went to Cardigan where she spent the remaining part of that and the beginning of the next year in a sort of melancholy retirement as appears by her  letters occasioned perhaps by the bad success of her husband's affairs Going to London in order to relieve her oppressed spirits with the conversation of her friends there she was seized by the small pox and died of it in Fleet street to the great grief of her acquaintance in the d year of her age and was buried June in the church of St Bennet Sherehog  Ballard's Memoirs  under a large monumental stone where several of her ancestors were before buried Mr Aubrey in his manuscript abovementioned observes that her person was of a middle stature pretty fat and ruddy complexioned  Soon after her death her Poems and Translations were collected and published in a volume in folio to which was added Monsieur Corneille's Pompey and Horace Tragedies with several other Translations out of French London with her picture a good busto before them standing on a pedestal on which is inscribed Orinda it was printed again at London In a collection of Letters published by Mr Thomas Brown in are printed four Letters from Mrs Philips to the Honourable Berenice Many years after her death were published a volume of excellent Letters from Mrs Philips to Sir Charles Cotterel with the ensuing title Letters from Orinda to Polliarchus vo London Major Pack in his Essay on Study inserted in his Miscellanies gives the following character of these Letters  'The best Letters I have met with in our English tongue are those of the celebrated Mrs Philips to Sir Charles Cotterel as they are directed all to the same person so they run all in the same strain and seem to have been employed in the service of a refined and generous friendship In a word they are such as a woman of spirit and virtue should  write to a courtier of honour and true gallantry'  The memory of this ingenious lady has been honoured with many encomiums Mr Thomas Rowe in his epistle to Daphne pays the following tribute to her fame  At last 'twas long indeed Orinda came  To ages yet to come an ever glorious name  To virtuous themes her well tun'd lyre she strung  Of virtuous themes in easy numbers sung  Horace and Pompey in her line appear  With all the worth that Rome did once revere  Much to Corneille they owe and much to her  Her thoughts her numbers and her fire the same  She soar'd as high and equal'd all his fame  Tho' France adores the bard nor envies Greece  The costly buskins of her Sophocles  More we expected but untimely death  Soon stopt her rising glories with her breath  More testimonies might be produced in favour of Mrs Philips but as her works are generally known and are an indelible testimony of her merit we reckon it superfluous Besides the poetical abilities of the amiable Orinda she is said to have been of a generous charitable disposition and a friend to all in distress  As few ladies ever lived more happy in her friends than our poetess so those friends have done justice to her memory and celebrated her when dead for those virtues they admired when living Mr Dryden more than once mentions her with honour and Mr Cowley has written an excellent Ode upon her death As this Ode will better shew the high opinion once entertained of Mrs Philips than any thing we can say after giving a specimen of her  poetry we shall conclude with this performance of Cowley's which breathes friendship in every line and speaks an honest mind so true is the observation of Pope upon the supposition that Cowley's works are falling into oblivion  Lost is his epic nay pindaric art  But still I love the language of his heart  Mrs Philips's poetry has not harmony of versification or amorous tenderness to recommend it but it has a force of thinking which few poets of the other sex can exceed and if it is without graces it has yet a great deal of strength As she has been celebrated for her friendship we shall present the reader with an Ode upon that subject addressed to her dearest Lucasia  I  Come my Lucasia since we see  That miracles men's faith do move  By wonder and by prodigy  To the dull angry world lets prove  There's a religion in our love  II  For tho' we were designed t'agree  That fate no liberty destroys  But our election is as free  As angels who with greedy choice  Are yet determined to their joys  III  Our hearts are doubled by the loss  Here mixture is addition grown  We both diffuse and both engross  And we whose minds are so much one  Never yet ever are alone  IV  We court our own captivity  Than thrones more great and innocent  'Twere banishment to be set free  Since we wear fetters whose intent  Not bondage is but ornament  V  Divided joys are tedious found  And griefs united easier grow  We are ourselves but by rebound  And all our titles shuffled so  Both princes and both subjects too  VI  Our hearts are mutual victims laid  While they such power in friendship lies  Are altars priests and offerings made  And each heart which thus kindly dies  Grows deathless by the sacrifice  On the DEATH of Mrs PHILIPS  I  Cruel disease ah could it not suffice  Thy old and constant spite to exercise  Against the gentlest and the fairest sex  Which still thy depredations most do vex  Where still thy malice most of all  Thy malice or thy lust does on the fairest fall  And in them most assault the fairest place  The throne of empress beauty ev'n the face  There was enough of that here to assuage  One would have thought either thy lust or rage  Was't not enough when thou profane disease  Didst on this glorious temple seize  Was't not enough like a wild zealot there  All the rich outward ornaments to tear  Deface the innocent pride of beauteous images  Was't not enough thus rudely to defile  But thou must quite destroy the goodly pile  And thy unbounded sacrilege commit  On th'inward holiest holy of her wit  Cruel disease there thou mistook'st thy power  No mine of death can that devour  On her embalmed name it will abide  An everlasting pyramide  As high as heav'n the top as earth the basis wide  II  All ages past record all countries now  In various kinds such equal beauties show  That ev'n judge Paris would not know  On whom the golden apple to bestow  Though goddesses to his sentence did submit  Women and lovers would appeal from it  Nor durst he say of all the female race  This is the sovereign face  And some tho' these be of a kind that's rare  That's much oh much less frequent than the fair  So equally renown'd for virtue are  That it the mother of the gods might pose  When the best woman for her guide she chose  But if Apollo should design  A woman Laureat to make  Without dispute he would Orinda take  Though Sappho and the famous nine  Stood by and did repine  To be a Princess or a Queen  Is great but 'tis a greatne  s always seen  The world did never but two women know  Who one by fraud th'other by wit did rise  To the two tops of spiritual dignities  One female pope of old one female poet now  III  Of female poets who had names of old  Nothing is shown but only told  And all we hear of them perhaps may be  Maleflatt'ry only and malepoetry  Few minutes did their beauties light'ning waste  The thunder of their voice did longer last  But that too soon was past  The certain proofs of our Orinda's wit  In her own lasting characters are writ  And they will long my praise of them survive  Though long perhaps too that may live  The trade of glory manag'd by the pen  Though great it be and every where is found  Does bring in but small profit to us men  'Tis by the number of the sharers drown'd  Orinda on the female coasts of fame  Ingrosses all the goods of a poetic name  She does no partner with her see  Does all the business there alone which we  Are forc'd to carry on by a whole company  IV  But wit's like a luxuriant vine  Unless to virtue's prop it join  Firm and erect towards Heav'n bound  Tho' it with beauteous leaves and pleasant fruit be crown'd  It lyes deform'd and rotting on the ground  Now shame and blush  s on us all  Who our own sex superior call  Orinda does our boasting sex out do  Not in wit only but in virtue too  She does above our best examples rise  In hate of vice and scorn of vanities  Never did spirit of the manly make  And dipp'd all o'er in learning's sacred lake  A temper more invulnerable take  No violent passion could an entrance find  Into the tender goodness of her mind  Through walls of stone those furious bullets may  Force their impetuous way  When her soft breast they hit damped and dead they lay  V  The fame of friendship which so long had told  Of three or four illustrious names of old  'Till hoarse and weary with the tale she grew  Rejoices now t'have got a new  A new and more surprizing story  Of fair Leucasia's and Orinda's glory  As when a prudent man does once perceive  That in some foreign country he must live  The language and the manners he does strive  To understand and practise here  That he may come no stranger there  So well Orinda did her self prepare  In this much different clime for her remove  To the glad world of poetry and love  MARGARET Duchess of NEWCASTLE  THE second wife of William Cavendish duke of Newcastle was born at St John's near Colchester in Essex about the latter end of the reign of King James I and was the youngest daughter of Sir Charles Lucas a gentleman of great spirit and fortune who died when she was very young The duchess herself in a book intitled Nature's Pictures drawn by Fancy's pencil to the life has celebrated both the exquisite beauty of her person and the rare endowments of her mind This lady's mother was remarkably assiduous in the education of her children and bestowed upon this all the instructions necessary for forming the minds of young ladies and introducing them into life with advantage She found her trouble in cultivating this daughter's mind not in vain for she discovered early an inclination to learning and spent so much of her time in study and writing that some of her Biographers have lamented her not being acquainted with the learned languages which would have extended her  knowledge corrected the exuberances of genius and have been of infinite service to her in her numerous compositions  In the year she obtained leave of her mother to go to Oxford where the court then resided and was made one of the Maids of Honour to Henrietta Maria the Royal Consort of King Charles I and when the Queen was forced to leave the arms of her Husband and fly into France by the violence of the prevailing power this lady attended her there At Paris she met with the marquis of Newcastle whose loyalty had likewise produced his exile who admiring her person and genius married her in the year The marquis had before heard of this lady for he was a patron and friend of her gallant brother lord Lucas who commanded under him in the civil wars He took occasion one day to ask his lordship what he could do for him as he had his interest much at heart to which he answered that he was not sollicitous about his own affairs for he knew the worst could be but suffering either death or exile in the Royal cause but his chief sollicitude was for his sister on whom he could bestow no fortune and whose beauty exposed her to danger he represented her amiable qualities and raised the marquis's curiosity to see her and from that circumstance arose the marquis's affection to this lady From Paris they went to Rotterdam where they resided six months from thence they returned to Antwerp where they settled and continued during the time of their exile as it was the most quiet place and where they could in the greatest peace enjoy their ruined fortune She proved a most agreeable companion to the marquis during the gloomy period of exile and enlivened their recess both by her writing and conversation as appears by the many compliments and addresses he made her on that occasion  The lady undertook a voyage into England in order to obtain some of the marquis's rents to supply their pressing necessities and pay the debts they had been there obliged to contract and accordingly went with her brother to Goldsmith's Hall where it seems the committee of sequestration sat but could not obtain the smallest sum out of the marquis's vast inheritance which amounted to l per annum and had it not been for the generosity and tenderness of Sir Charles Cavendish who greatly reduced his own fortune to support his brother in distress they must have been exposed to extreme poverty  Having raised a considerable sum by the generosity of her own and the marquis's relations she returned to Antwerp where she continued with her lord till the restoration of Charles II upon which the marquis after six years banishment made immediate preparation for his return to his native country leaving his lady behind him to dispatch his affairs there who having conducted them to his lordship's satisfaction she soon followed her consort into England Being now restored to the sunshine of prosperity she dedicated her time to writing poems philosophical discourses orations and plays She was of a generous turn of mind and kept a great many young ladies about her person who occasionally wrote what she dictated Some of them slept in a room contiguous to that in which her Grace lay and were ready at the call of her bell to rise any hour of the night to write down her conceptions lest they should escape her memory  The young ladies no doubt often dreaded her Grace's conceptions which were frequent but all of the poetical or philosophical kind for though she was very beautiful she died without issue she is said to have been very reserved and peevish perhaps owing to the circumstance just mentioned  of having never been honoured with the name of mother  Mr Jacob says that she was the most voluminous writ  r of all the female poets that she had a great deal of wit and a more than ordinary propensity to dramatic poetry and Mr Langba  ne tells us that all the language and plots of her plays were her own which says he is a commendation preserable to fame built on other people's foundation and will very well atone for some faults in her numerous productions As the Duchess is said to be negligent in regard to chronology in her historical writings so others have been equally remiss in this respect with regard to her Grace for among the many authors who have taken notice of her not one has mentioned the year in which she died and even her monumental inscription where one might reasonably expect it is silent both in respect to her age and the time of her death But Mr Fulman in the th volume of his MS collections in the Corpus Christi College Archives observes that she died in London Anno and was buried at Westminster January where an elegant monument is erected to her memory of which take the following account given by Dr Crul in the Antiquities of that Church  'Against the skreen of the chapel of St Michael is a most noble spacious tomb of white marble adorned with two pillars of black marble with entablatures of the Corinthian order embellished with arms and most curious trophy works on the pedestal lye two images in full proportion of white marble in a cumbent posture in their robes representing William Cavendish duke of Newcastle and Margaret his duchess his second and last wife being the daughter of Sir Charles and the sister of lord Lucas of Colchester who as she had deservedly acquired the reputation of a lady  of uncommon wit learning and liberality so the duke her husband had rendered himself famous for his loyalty and constant fidelity to the royal family during the civil wars in this kingdom and in Scotland The duke having caused this stately monument to be erected here to the memory of his lady died soon after in the year aged and was interred here'  The Epitaph for the Duchess  "Here lies the loyal Duke of Newcastle and his Duchess his second wife by whom he had no issue Her name was' Margaret Lucas youngest sister to the Lord Lucas of Colchester a noble family for all the brothers were valiant and all the sisters virtuous This Duchess was a wise witty and learned Lady which her many books do well testify She was a most virtuous and loving and careful wife and was with her Lord all the time of his banishment and miseries and when they came home never parted with him in his solitary retirements"  The following is a catalogue of her works in which we have taken pains to be as accurate as possible in order to do justice to the poetical character of this lady  The World's

CAVENDISH  BAron Ogle viscount Mansfield earl marquis and duke of Newcastle justly reckoned one of the most finished gentlemen as well as the most distinguished patriot general and statesman of his age He was son of Sir Charles Cavendish youngest son of Sir William Cavendish and younger brother of the first earl of Devonshire by Katherine daughter of Cuthbert lord Ogle  Dugdale's Baron vol  He was born in the year and discovered in his infancy a promptness of genius and a love of literature His father took care to have him instructed by the best masters in every science He no sooner appeared at the court of King James I than the reputation of his abilities drew the attention of that monarch upon him who made him a knight of the Bath at the creation of Henry Prince of Wales  Dugdale vol p    In his father died who left him a great estate and having interest at court he was by letters patent dated Nov raised to the dignity of a peer of the realm by the stile and title of baron Ogle and viscount Mansfield and having no less credit with King Charles I than he had with his father in the third year of the  reign of that prince he was advanced to the higher title of earl of Newcastle upon Tyne and at the same time he was created baron Cavendish of Balsover Our author's attendance upon court tho' it procured him honour yet introduced him very early into difficulties and it appears by Strafford's letters that he did not stand well with the favourite duke of Buckingham who was jealous of his growing interest and was too penetrating not to discover that the quickness of his lordship's parts would soon suggest some methods of rising independent of the favourite and perhaps shaking his influence  "But these difficulties says Clarendon for he was deeply plunged in debt tho' they put him on the thoughts of retirement never in the least prevented him from demonstrating his loyalty when the King's cause demanded it"  Notwithstanding the earl's interest was not high with the ministers yet he found means so to gain and to preserve the affection of his Majesty that in the year when it was thought necessary to take the Prince of Wales out of the hands of a woman his Majesty appointed the earl his governor and by entrusting to his tuition the heir apparent of his kingdoms demonstrated the highest confidence in his abilities and honour  Dugdale ubi supra    In the spring of the year the troubles of Scotland breaking out induced the King to assemble an army in the North soon after which he went to put himself at the head of it and in his way was splendidly entertained by the earl at his seat at Welbeck as he had been some years before when he went into Scotland to be crowned which in itself tho' a trivial circumstance yet such was the magnificence of this noble  peer that both these entertainments found a place in general histories and are computed by the duchess of Newcastle who wrote the life of her lord to have amounted to upwards of ten thousand pounds He invited all the neighbouring gentry to pay their compliments to his Majesty and partake of the feast and Ben Johnson was employed in fitting such scenes and speeches as he could best devise and Clarendon after mentioning the sumptuousness of those entertainments observes that they had a tendency to corrupt the people and inspire a wantonness which never fails to prove detrimental to morals  As such an expedition as the King's against the Scots required immense sums and the King's treasury being very empty his lordship contributed ten thousand pounds and raised a troop of horse consisting of about knights and gentlemen who served at their own charge and was honoured with the title of the Prince's troop  Rushworth's collection vol p  Tho' these instances of loyalty advanced him in the esteem of the King yet they rather heightened than diminished the resentment of the ministers of which the earl of Holland having given a stronger instance than his lordship's patience could bear he took notice of it in such a way as contributed equally to sink his rival's reputation and raise his own and as there is something curious in the particular manner in which the earl of Holland's character suffered in this quarrel we shall upon the authority of the duchess of Newcastle present it to the reader  The troop which the earl of Newcastle raised was stiled the Prince's but his lordship commanded it as captain When the army drew near Berwick he sent Sir William Carnaby to the earl  of Holland then general of the horse to know where his troop should march his answer was next after the troops of the general officers The earl of Newcastle sent again to represent that having the honour to march with the Prince's colours he thought it not fit to march under any of the officers of the field upon which the general of the horse repeated his orders and the earl of Newcastle ordered the Prince's colours to be taken off the staff and marched without any When the service was over his lordship sent Mr Francis Palmer with a challenge to the earl of Holland who consented to a place and hour of meeting but when the earl of Newcastle came thither he found not his antagonist but his second The business had been disclosed to the King by whose authority says Clarendon the matter was composed but before that time the earl of Holland was never suspected to want courage and indeed he was rather a cunning penetrating than a brave honest man and was remarkably selfish in his temper  The earl of Newcastle however found himself hard pressed by the ministerial faction and being unwilling to give his Majesty any trouble about himself he was generous enough to resign his place as governor to the Prince and the marquis of Hertford was appointed in his room  His lordship having no more business at court and being unwilling to expose himself further to the machinations of his enemies thought proper to retire to the country where he remained quiet till he received his Majesty's orders to revisit Hull Tho' this order came at twelve o'clock at night yet such was his unshaken loyalty and af  ection that he went directly and tho' forty miles distant he entered the place with only three or four servants early the next morning He offered to his Majesty says Clarendon to have  secured for him that important fortress and all the magazines that were in it but instead of receiving such a command he had instructions sent him to obey the orders of the Parliament who suspecting his principles not to be favourable to the schemes of opposition then engaged in called him to attend the service of the house and some disaffected members formed a design to have attacked him but his character being unexceptionable their scheme proved abortive and he had leave to retire again into the country This he willingly did as he saw the affairs of state hastening to confusion and his country ready to be steeped in blood and sacrificed to the fury of party But when the opposition rose high and it would have been cowardice to have remained unactive he embraced the royal cause accepted a commission for raising men to take care of the town of Newcastle and the four adjoining counties in which he was to expeditious and successful that his Majesty constituted him general of all the forces raised North of Trent and likewise general and commander in chief of such as might be raised in the counties of Lincoln Nottingham Chester Leicester Rutland Cambridge Huntingdon Norfolk Suffolk and Essex with power to confer the honour of knighthood coin money print and set forth such declarations as should seem to him expedient of all which extensive powers tho freely conferred and without reserve his lordship made a very sparing use but with respect to the more material point of raising men his lordship prosecuted it with such diligence that in three months he had an army of eight thousand horse foot and dragoons with which he marched directly into Yorkshire and his forces having defeated the enemy at Pierce Bridge his lordship advanced to York where Sir Thomas Glenham the governor  presented him with the keys and the earl of Cumberland and many of the nobility resorted thither to compliment and assist his lordship  Clarendon p  In the course of this civil war we find the earl of Newcastle very successful in his master's service he more than once defeated Sir Thomas Fairfax the general of the Parliament and won several important forts and battles for which his Majesty in gratitude for his services by letters patent dated the th of Oct advanced him to the dignity of marquiss of Newcastle and in the preamble of his patent all his services says Dugdale are mentioned with suitable encomiums  In the year after Prince Rupert had been successful in raising the siege of York and flushed with the prosperity of his arms against the consent of the marquis he risked the battle of MarsoonMoor in which the marquis's infantry were cut to pieces Seeing the King's affairs in these counties totally undone he made the best of his way to Scarborough and from thence with a few of the principal officers of his army took shipping for Hamburgh and left his estates which were valued at upwards of twenty thousand pounds per ann to be plundered by the Parliament's forces After staying six months at Hamburgh he went by sea to Amsterdam and from thence made a journey to Paris where he continued for some time and where notwithstanding the vast estate he had when the civil war broke out his circumstances were now so bad that himself and his young wife were reduced to pawn their cloaths for sustenance  Life of the D of Newcastle p  He removed afterwards to Antwerp that he might be nearer his own country and there tho' under very great difficulties he resided for several years while the  Parliament in the mean time levied vast sums upon his estate insomuch that the computation of what he lost by the disorders of these times tho' none of the particulars can be disproved amount to an incredible sum but notwithstanding all these severities of fortune he never lost his spirit and was often heard to say that if he was not much mistaken the clouds of adversity which then hung over his country would be dispersed at last by the King's restoration that rebellion would entangle itself in its own toils and after an interval of havock and confusion order would return once more by the restoration of an exiled Prince Notwithstanding the hardships of an eighteen years banishment in which he experienced variety of wretchedness he retained his vigour to the last He was honoured by persons of the highest distinction abroad and Don John of Austria and several princes of Germany visited him  Ashmole's order of the garter  But what comforted him most was the company frequently of his young King who in the midst of his sufferings bestowed upon him the most noble Order of the Garter The gloomy period at last came to an end and the marquis returned to his country with his sovereign and by letters patent dated the th of March he was advanced to the dignity of earl of Ogle and duke of Newcastle He spent the evening of his days in a country retirement and indulged himself in those studies with which he was most affected  This noble person f  om his earliest youth was celebrated for his love of the muses and was the great patron of the poets in the reign of King Charles I This propension has drawn on him tho' very unjustly the censure of some grave  men Lord Clarendon mentions it with decency but Sir Philip Warwick in his history of the rebellion loses all patience and thinks it sufficient to ruin this great general's character that he appointed Sir William Davenant a poet his lieutenantgeneral of the ordnance insinuating that it was impossible a man could have a turn for poetry and a capacity for any thing else at the same time in which observation Sir Philip has given a convincing proof of his ignorance of poetry and want of taste The example of the glorious Sidney is sufficient to confute this historian and did not Mr Chillingworth combat with great success though in other branches of literature against the Papal church by the dint of reason and argument and at the same time served as engineer in the royal army with great ability  See his life by Mr des Maizeaux  The truth is this worthy nobleman having himself a taste for the liberal arts was always pleased to have men of genius about him and had the pleasure to rescue necessitous merit from obscurity Ben Johnson was one of his favourites and he addressed to him some of his verses which may be seen in his works  In the busy scenes of life it does not appear that this nobleman suffered his thoughts to stray so far from his employment as to turn author but in his exile resuming his old taste of breaking and managing horses than which there cannot be a more manly exercise he thought fit to publish his sentiments upon a subject of which he was perfectly master The title is The New Method for managing Horses with cuts Antwerp This book was first written in English and afterwards translated into French by his lordship's directions  This great man died in the possession of the highest honours and fairest reputation the th of December in the th year of his age His grace was twice married but had issue only by his first lady His titles descended to his son Henry earl of Ogle who was the last heir male of his family and died with whom the title of Newcastle in the line of Cavendish became extinct  In his exile he wrote two comedies viz  The Country Captain a Comedy printed at Antwerp afterwards presented by his Majesty's servants at BlackFryars and very much commended by Mr Leigh  Variety a Comedy presented by his Majesty's Servants at BlackFryars and first printed in and generally bound with the Country Captain it was also highly commended in a copy of verses by Mr Alexander Brome  He likewise has written  The Humourous Lovers a Comedy acted by his royal highness's servants Lond to This was received with great applause and esteemed one of the best plays of that time  The Triumphant Widow or the Medley of Humours a Comedy acted by his royal highness's servants Lond to which pleased Mr Shadwell so well that he transcribed a part of it into his Bury Fair one of the most taking plays of that poet  Shadwell says of his grace that he was the greatest master of wit the most exact observer of mankind and the most accurate judge of humour that ever he knew  Sir JOHN BIRKENHEAD  WINSTANLEY in his short account of this gentleman says that they who are ignorant of his works must plead ignorance of all wit and learning but the truth is though he made some figure in his time yet it was not so confiderable as to transmit his name with any lustre to posterity and Winstanley has been too peremptory in secluding those from wit who should be ignorant of the fame of Birkenhead This observation however excited us to a search after some particulars concerning him for Winstanley himself has given very few and closes his life in his usual way with only informing the readers that he lived in such a reign The best account we could find of him is in the Athenae Oxon of Wood Our author was son of Randal Birkenhead of Northwich in Cheshire Sadler and was born there he became a servitor of Oriel College under the tuition of Humphrey Lloyd afterwards lord bishop of Bangor He continued in the college till he was made bachelor of arts and then becoming Amanuensis to Dr Laud afterwards archbishop of Canterbury who taking a liking to him for his ingenuity did by his diploma make him master of arts An and by his letters commendatory thereupon he was elected probationer fellow of AllSouls College in the year following After the rebe  lion broke out and the King set up his court at Oxford our author was appointed to write the Mercurii Aulici which being very pleasing to the loyal party his Majesty recommended  him to the electors that they would chuse him moral philosophy reader which being accordingly done he continued in that office with little profit from it till at which time he was not only turned out thence but from his fellowship by the Presbyterian visitors Afterwards in this destitute situation Wood observes that he retired to London and made shift to live upon his wits having some reputation in poetry he was often applied to by young people in love to write epistles for them and songs and sonnets on their mistresses he was also employed in translating and writing other little things so as to procure a tolerable livelihood  Having in this manner supported the gloomy period of confusion he was at his Majesty's restoration by virtue of his letters sent to the university created doctor of the civil law and in he was elected a Burgess for Wilton to serve in that Parliament which began at Westminster the th of May the same year In November he received the honour of knighthood and January he was constituted one of the masters of requests in the room of Sir Richard Fanshaw when he went ambassador into Spain he being then also master of the faculties and a member of the Royal Society An anonymous writer tells us that Sir John Berkenhead was a poor alehousekeeper's son and that he rose by lying or buffooning at court to be one of the masters of requests and faculty office and also got by gifts at court l This is a poor reflexion upon him and indeed rather raises than detracts from his reputation for a man certainly must have merit who can rise without the advantage of fortune or birth whereas these often procure a fool preferment and make him eminent who might otherwise have lived and died in obscurity  It is said of Birkenhead that when an unmannerly Member of Parliament in opposing him took occasion to say that he was surprized to hear an alehousekeeper's son talk so confidently in the House he coolly replied I am an alehousekeeper's son I own it and am not ashamed of it but had the gentleman who upbraided me with my birth been thus descended in all probability he would have been of the same profession himself a reply at once sensible and witty Mr Wood however seems to be of opinion that he was too much given to bantering and that if he had thrown less of the buffoon or mimic into his conversation his wit would have been very agreeable He is charged by Wood with a higher failing which ought indeed rather to be construed one of the blackest crimes that is ingratitude to those who assisted him in distress whom says he he afterwards slighted This is a heavy charge and if true not a little diminishes his reputation but methinks some apology may even be made for his slighting those who assisted him in distress we find they were such persons as could never challenge esteem young men in love for whom he wrote sonnets and for whom he might have no friendship it often happens that men of parts are so unhappy as to be obliged to such people with whom were their situation otherwise it would be beneath them to associate and it is no wonder when prosperity returns that they in some measure forget obligations they owed to those of a rank so much inferior and something must be allowed to that pride which a superior understanding naturally inspires  Our author's works are  Mercurius Aulicus Communicating the Intelligence and the Affairs of the Court at Oxford to  the rest of the Kingdom the first of these was published on the st of January and were carried on till about the end of after which time they were published but now and then They were printed weekly in one sheet and sometimes in more in to and contain says Wood a great deal of wit and buffoonery  News from Pembroke

Martin's in the Fields leaving behind him a collection of Pamphlets which came into the hands of his executors Sir Richard Mason and Sir Muddeford Bramston  ROGER BOYLE Earl of ORRERY  WAS younger brother of Richard earl of Burlington and Cork and fifth son of Richard stiled the great earl of Cork He was born April and independent of the advantage of his birth and titles was certainly one of the ablest politicians as well as most accomplished noblemen of his age By the influence of his father with lord deputy Faulkland he was raised to the dignity of baron Broghill in the kingdom of Ireland in when only seven years old  Earl of Cork's True Remembrance  He received his education at the college of Dublin  where he studied with so much diligence as gave great hopes of his future atchievements and the rapid progress he made in erudition induced his father to send him about to make the tour of France and Italy under the care of one Mr Marcomes and in the company of lord Kynalmeaky his elder brother and this method the earl took to perfect all his sons after they had gone through the course of a domestic education and it is remarkable that all his children travelled under the same gentleman's protection who has no small honour reflected on him from his illustrious pupils Upon his return from his travels he found a war ready to break out against the Scots and was pressed by the earl of Northumberland the commander in chief of the expedition to share in reducing them but this commotion subsiding his lordship employed himself another way By his father's desire who loved to settle his children early in the world he married lady Margaret Howard daughter to the earl of Suffolk and setting out for Ireland landed there the very day the rebellion broke out viz Oct The post assigned him in this time of danger was the defence of his father's castle of Lismore in which he gave proofs of the most gallant spirit as well as political conduct The first of which he shewed in the vigorous sally he made to the relief of Sir Richard Osborn who was besieged in his own house by the rebels till relieved by lord Broghill who raised the siege and saved him and all his family  Morrice's Memoirs of E Orrery chap  and a strong proof of the latter by advising Sir William St Leger then president of Munster to act vigorously against the Irish  notwithstanding they produced the King's commission which he was penetrating enough to discern to be a forgery  After the cessation in Ireland lord Broghill came to Oxford then the residence of King Charles I and paid his duty to that monarch and was honoured with many private audiences when he represented to his Majesty the temper and disposition of the Irish Papists and the falshood of the pretended Committee they had sent over to mislead his Majesty that the King was convinced the Irish never meant to keep the cessation and that therefore it was not the interest of the English subjects to depend upon it  Now that we have mentioned the Irish Papists one thing must not be omitted as it is both curious in itself and reflects honour on lord Broghill Many years after the reduction of these rebels his lordship who was then earl of Orrery happened to pay a visit to the duke of Ormond at Kilkenny where he met with lord Muskerry who headed the insurrection and produced a false commission for what he did Finding Muskerry in an open good humour he took occasion to retire with him and to ask him in a pleasant manner how he came by that commission which had so much the appearance of being genuine  'Lord Muskerry answered I'll be free and unreserved with you my lord it was a forged commission drawn up by one Walsh a lawyer and others who having a writing to which the Great Seal was affixed one of the company very dextrously took off the sealed wax from the label of that writing and fixed it to the label of the forged commission Whilst this was doing another accident happened which startled all present and almost disconcerted the scheme The forged commission being finished  while the parchment was handling and turning in order to put on the seal a tame wolf which lay asleep by the fire awakened at the crackling of the parchment and running to it seized it and tore it to pieces notwithstanding their haste and struggle to prevent him so that after all their pains they were obliged to begin a new and write it all over again  Memoirs of the Earl of Orrery p  '  Lord Orrery struck with the daring wickedness of this action could not help expressing himself to that effect while Muskerry replied merrily it would have been impossible to have kept the people together without this device  'Till the death of King Charles I we find lord Broghill warm in the royal interest and that he abhorred those measures which he foresaw would distract his country and as soon as that melancholy event happened he quitted his estate  Carte's Life of the Duke of Ormond  as ruined past all hopes and hid himself in the privacy of a close retirement How he came afterwards to alter his conduct and join with a party he before so much abhorred we shall endeavour to shew  Upon his lordship's coming from Ireland he withdrew to Marston in Somersetshire where he had leisure to reflect on the ruined state of the Kingdom  Memoirs of the Interregnum p  and when he revolved in his mind its altered and desperate situation he was ashamed to think that he should remain an idle spectator of his country's miseries being of a different opinion from Mr Addison  'That when vice prevails and wicked men bear sway the post of honour is a private station'  These reflexions roused him to action and produced a scheme worthy of himself He resolved to attempt something  in favour of the King and accordingly under the pretence of going to the Spa for his health he determined to cross the seas and apply to Charles II for a commission to raise forces in Ireland in order to restore his Majesty and recover his own estate Having formed this resolution he desired the earl of Warwick who had an interest with the prevailing party to procure a licence for him to go to the Spa He communicated his scheme to some confirmed royalists in whom he thought he could confide and having rais'd a considerable sum of money he came up to London to prosecute his voyage Lord Broghil however was betrayed and the committee who then took upon them the government of the realm threatened him with destruction Cromwell interceeded and being sensible of his lordship's great abilities obtained a permission to talk privately with him before they proceeded to extremities Cromwell waited upon Broghill and reproached him gently for his intention which his lordship denied but Cromwell producing letters of his writing to several Royalists in whom he confided he found it was in vain to dissemble any longer The General then told him that he was no stranger to his merit tho' he had never before seen him and that as the reduction of Ireland was intrusted to him he had authority from the Committee to offer his lordship a command in that war and insisted upon his answer immediately as the Committee were then sitting and waiting his return Lord Broghill was infinitely surprized at so generous and unexpected an offer from Cromwell He thought himself at liberty by all the rules of honour to serve against the Irish whose cruelty and rebellion were equally detested by the royal party as by the Parliament and his life and freedom  being in danger if he refused he accepted the commission and immediately repaired to Bristol to wait there till forces should be sent him This story we have from Mr Morrice who heard it from lord Orrery himself and he adds that it is very probable his lordship's design was betrayed out of pure love and affection by his sister Ranelagh but how this love and affection enabled her to foresee that Cromwell would interpose to remove the danger which she exposed him to is left by the reverend author unaccounted for Ever after this interposition and friendly offer of Cromwell we find gratitude binding lord Broghill to a faithfull service in his interest and in the course of his ministry to Cromwell he prevented many shameful acts of cruelty which would have been otherwise perpetrated  No sooner had Broghill arrived in Ireland but his old friends flocked round him and demonstrated the great heigth of popularity to which he had risen in that kingdom nor did his accepting this new commission make him negligent of their interest for he did all he could for the safety of their persons and estates An opportunity soon presented in which he very remarkably distinguished himself He engaged at Macroom with two thousand horse and dragoons a party of Irish consisting of upwards of five thousand whom he totally defeated and took their general the titular bishop of Ross prisoner  Cox's History of Ireland vol part d p  This battle was fought May Lord Broghill offered the bishop his life if he would order those who were in the castle of Carigdroghid to surrender which he promised but when he was conducted to the place he persuaded the garrison to defend it to the last extremity Upon  this lord Broghill caused him to be hanged tho' Mr Morrice says the soldiers hanged him without orders and then commanded his heavy artillery to be brought up which astonished his own army exceedingly they knowing he had not so much as a single piece of battering cannon He caused however several large trees to be cut and drawn at a distance by his baggage horses the besieged judging by the slowness of their motion they were a vast size capitulated before they came up as his lordship advised threatening otherwise to give them no quarter He relieved Cromwell at Clonmell and assisted both him and his fatherinlaw Ireton in their expedition but because he could not moderate the fury of one and mitigate the cruelty of the other he incurred the displeasure of both and Ireton was heard to say that neither he nor Cromwell could be safe while Broghill had any command Notwithstanding the aversion of Ireton to his lordship yet he took care not to remit any of his diligence in prosecuting the war he marched to that general's assistance at the siege of Limerick and by his conduct and courage was the means of that town's falling into the hands of the Commonwealth and till Ireland was entirely reduced he continued active in his commission  When Oliver rose to the dignity of Lord Protector he sent for lord Broghill merely to have his advice and we are told by Oldmixon in his history of the Stewarts that he then proposed to Cromwell to marry his daughter to King Charles II and that as the Prince was then in distress abroad he doubted not but his necessity would make him comply with the offer he represented to the Protector the great danger to which he was exposed by the fickle humour of the English  who never doat long upon a favourite but pull that man from eminence to day whom they had but yesterday raised out of the dust that this match would rivet his interest by having the lawful prince so nearly allied to him and perhaps his grandchild the indisputed heir of the crown That he might then rule with more safety nor dread either the violence of the Royalists or the insidious enemies of his own government Upon hearing this Cromwell made a pause and looking stedfastly in my lord's face he asked him if he was of opinion that the exiled prince could ever forgive his father's murderer he answered as before that his necessity was great and in order to be restored to his crown would even sacrifice his natural resentment to his own ease and grandeur but Cromwell could not be induced to believe that ever Charles could pardon him  Whether lord Broghill was serious in this proposal cannot be determined but if he was it is certain he had a mean opinion of Charles to have capitulated upon any terms with Cromwell would have been betraying the dignity of his birth and his right to reign but to have stooped so low as to take to his arms a child of his who had murdered his father and driven him to his exile would have been an instance of the most infamous meanness that ever was recorded in history and all the blemishes of that luxurious Prince's character and the errors of his reign collected do not amount to any thing so base as would have been those nuptials  In the year it was proposed to his lordship by the Protector to go down to Scotland with an absolute authority either because he suspected Monk or was willing to give the people of that country some satisfaction who complained  of his severity but he was very unwilling to receive the charge and took it at last upon these conditions  Thurloe's State Papers  The first was that he should be left to himself and receive no orders and the second that no complaints should find credit or procure directions in his absence and the third that he should be recalled in a year He was very acceptable to the Scotch and gained a great influence over them by speaking and acting with moderation After his return he was with Whitlock and Thurloe admitted into all the confidence that could be expected from a person in the Protector's circumstances who if he had any chearful moments spent them in their company where he appeared quite another person than in the ordinary course of his conduct which was built on a policy suited to his condition the people he had to deal with and the critical juncture of the times Our author stood high in Cromwell's favour to the last and it was no doubt in some measure owing to his gratitude that he attached himself so firmly to his son and successor Richard It perhaps will appear strange but it is supported by evidence that Cromwell did not love his own family so well as lord Broghill did Being asked upon his deathbed whom he appointed his successor he answered  "That in such a closet his will would be found"  in which he named Fleetwood but one of the Protector's daughters getting first to the drawer she took the will and destroyed it  Morrice's Memoirs chap    Thus Richard against his father's intention obtained the government which however it is very plain he was not fit to hold for all the art  and industry of Broghill could never so govern his proceedings but that some steps either too violent or too remiss were taken by which his administration fell into contempt and doubtless the reason why Cromwell excluded his son was that he discovered his weakness and found him without a capacity of reigning When the oppression of committees the general distraction amongst the people and the anarchy into which the English affairs had fallen began to point towards a restoration we find lord Broghill declaring early for the King going over into Ireland there founding the minds of the officers and preparing that kingdom for the reception of his Majesty with open arms  Thus we have seen him discharge with honour the debt of gratitude he owed to Cromwell but notwithstanding the figure he made in the service it is by no means clear that ever he was warmly attached to the republic he was detected in having drank the King's health in company with the Protector's children which Oliver very prudently thought proper to pass over After the restoration Broghill wanted not enemies who insinuated things against him to King Charles and blamed his tardiness in procuring his Majesty's return but his lordship made it clear that he was the first who declared for him in Ireland and the most zealous as well as the most powerful promoter of his interest His Majesty was so well satisfied with his lordship's proceedings that he wrote to him with his own hand and thanked him for his loyalty  Budgel's Memoirs of the family of the Boyles  On September as an incontested proof of his Majesty's affection for his lordship he by letters patent advanced him to the honour of earl of Orrery in the county of  Cork  Collin's peerage vol iv p  and Sir Maurice Eustace a friend of the duke of Ormond's being appointed chancellor Roger earl of Orrery and Charles Coote earl of Montrath were with him made lords justices about the close of that memorable year  From that time till his death we find lord Orrery in the highest esteem in the three nations He was employed by his Majesty to confer with the earl of Clarendon whose imperious steps it seems had highly disobliged his master and when that great man fell the King made an offer of the seals to the earl of Orrery who on account of his want of bodily vigour declined it At the same time he accepted a most arduous and unpleasing office from the King and that was to expostulate with the duke of York and bring him to ask pardon for the haughty and insolent measures he took in supporting the chancellor  His Majesty warmly pressed him to become a favourer of the French alliance and for the reduction of the Dutch neither of which were at all agreeable to his notions and therefore that he might more concisely express the mischievous consequences he apprehended from these measures he reduced his thoughts into a poem and this was very well received by the King who thought to have made some impression on him in his turn in a long audience he gave him for that purpose but the earl's duty would not permit him to coincide in his opinion with the King when he was sensible that the King's scheme was contrary to the interest of the nation and this led him in plain terms to declare that he never would concur in counsels to aggrandize France which was already too great or to break the power of the Dutch which was barely sufficient for their own defence  Love's Memoirs of the Earl of Orrery    There is a particular circumstance in relation to this affair which must not be omitted When lord Orrery came from the audience of his Majesty he was met by the earl of Danby who asked him whether he had closed with the King's proposals to which lord Orrery answered no Then replied the other statesman  "Your lordship may be the honester man but you will never be worth a groat"  This passage is the more remarkable because Danby was of the same opinion with Orrery and temporized purely for the sake of power which cost him afterwards a long imprisonment and had very near lost him his life So dear do such men often pay for sacrificing honour to interest In the year Oct this great statesman died in the full possession of honours and fame he had lived in the most tumultuous times he had embarked in a dangerous ocean and he had the address to steer at last to a safe haven As a man his character was very amiable he was patient compassionate and generous as a soldier he was of undaunted courage as a statesman of deep penetration and invincible industry and as a poet of no mean rank  Before we give an account of his works it will not be amiss in order to illustrate the amiable character of lord Orrery to shew that tho' he espoused the Protector's interest yet he was of singular service to the nation in restraining the violence of his cruelty and checking the domineering spirit of those slaves in authority who then called themselves the legislature  The authors of the Biographia Britannica say  'that our author opposed in Parliament and defeated the blackest measure Cromwell ever entered into which was the passing a law for decimating the royal party and his lordship's conduct in this was by far the greatest  action of his whole life He made a long and an elaborate speech in which he shewed the injustice cruelty and folly of that truly infamous and Nerolike proposition Finding that he was likely to lose the question upon the division which probably would have issued in losing his life also he stood up and boldly observed  "That he did not think so many Englishmen could be fond of slavery"  Upon which so many members rose and followed him that the Speaker without telling declared from the chair the Noes have it and the bill was accordingly thrown out Upon this he went immediately up to Cromwell and said  "I have done you this day as great a service as ever I did in my life How returned Cromwell by hindring your government replied my lord from becoming hateful which already begins to be disliked for if this bill had passed three kingdoms would have risen up against you and they were your enemies and not your friends who brought it in"  'This Cromwell so firmly believed that he never forgave nor trusted them afterwards'  King Charles II put my lord upon writing plays which he did upon the occasion of a dispute that arose in the Royal presence about writing plays in rhime Some affirmed that it wa  to be done others that it would spoil the fancy to be so confined but lord Orrery was of another opinion and his Majesty being willing that a trial should be made laid his commands on his lordship to employ some of his leisure time that way which his lordship readily compl  ed with and soon after composed the Black Prince  It is difficult to give a full and accurate acc  nt of this nobleman's compositions for it must be owned he was a Letter statesman than a poet  and fitter to act upon the wide theatre of life than to write representations for the circumscribed theatre of the stage In the light of an author he is less eminent and lived a life of too much hurry to become a proficient in poetry a grace which not only demands the most extensive abilities but much leisure and contemplation But if he was not extremely eminent as a poet he was far removed above contempt and deserves to have full mention made of all his writings and we can easily forgive want of elegance and correctness in one who was of so much service to his country and who was born rather to live than to write a great part  According to the least exceptionable account his works are as follow  The Irish Colours displayed in a reply of an English Protestant to an Irish Roman Catholic Lond to  An Answer to a scandalous Letter lately printed and subscribed by Peter Walsh procurator for the Secular and Romish priests of Ireland This was the same infamous Walsh

in that deplorable massacre our author's mother came with her son into England and he having says Winstanley been trained up in learning was by the help of some friends educated at Oxford in the same college where his father formerly had been a student but as his circumstances were mean he was taken away from thence and bound apprentice to a bookseller in London but his genius being addicted to poetry before his time was expired he wrote a piece called Venus Cabinet unlocked and afterwards he married and set up for himself in which condition he did not long continue for being addicted to gaming he ruined his affairs In this distress he went over to Ireland and composed his Hic Ubique a noted comedy and which gained him some reputation He then returned to England reprinted his comedy and dedicated it to the duke of Monmouth from whom he received no great encouragement This circumstance induced him to reflect that the life of an author was at once the most dissipated and unpleasing in the world that it is in every man's power to injure him and that few are disposed to promote him Animated by these reflexions he again took a house and from author resumed his old trade of a bookseller in which no doubt he judged right for while an author be his genius and parts ever  so bright is employed in the composition of one book a bookseller may publish twenty so that in the very nature of things a bookseller without oppression a crime which by unsuccessful writers is generally imputed to them may grow rich while the most industrious and able author can arrive at no more than a decent competence and even to that many a great genius has never attained  No sooner had Mr Head a little recovered himself than we find him cheated again by the syren alurements of pleasure and poetry in the latter of which however it does not appear he made any proficiency He failed a second time in the world and having recourse to his pen wrote the first part of the English Rogue which being too libertine could not be licensed till he had expunged some of the most luscious descriptions out of it  Mr Winstanley p has informed us that at the coming out of this first part he was with  at the Three Cup tavern in Holborn drinking a glass of Rhenish and made these verses upon him  What Gusman Buscan Francion Rablais writ  I once applauded for most excellent wit  But reading thee and thy rich fancy's store  I now condemn what I admir'd before  Henceforth translations pack away be gone  No Rogue so well writ as the English one  We cannot help observing that Winstanley has a little ridiculously shewn his vanity by informing the world that he could afford to drink a glass of Rhenish and has added nothing to his reputation by the verses which have neither poetry nor wit in them  This English Rogue described in the life of Meriton Latroon a witty extravagant was published anno in a very large vo There were three more parts added to it by Francis Kirkman and Mr Head in conjunction  He also wrote  Jackson's Recantation or the Life and Death of a notorious highwayman then hanging in chains at Hamstead  Proteus Redivivus or the Art of wheedling Lond  The Floating Island or a voyage from Lambethanio to Ramalia  A Discovery of Old Brazil  The Red Sea  He wrote a Pamphlet against Dr Wild in answer to Wild's letter directed to his friend upon occasion of his

to the Isle of Wight  THOMAS HOBBS  THIS celebrated philosopher was son of Thomas Hobbs vicar of Westport within the Liberty of Malmesbury and of Charlton in Wilts and was born at Westport on the th of April  Wood ubi supra  It is related by Bayle that his mother being frighted at the rumours of the report of the Spanish Armada was brought to bed of him before her time which makes it somewhat surprizing that he should live to so great an age He had made an extraordinary progress in the languages before he arrived at his th year when he was sent to Oxford where he studied for five years Aristotle's philosophy In the year he took the degree of batchelor of arts and upon the recommendation of the principal of the college he entered into the service of William Cavendish baron Hardwicke soon afterwards earl of Devonshire  Athen Oxon p  by whom being much esteemed for his pleasantry and humour he was appointed tutor to his son lord William Cavendish several years younger than Hobbs Soon after our author travelled with this young nobleman thro' France and Italy where he made himself master  of the different languages of the countries thro' which he travelled but finding that he had in a great measure forgot his Greek and Latin he dedicated his leisure hours to the revival of them and in order to fix the Greek language more firmly in his mind upon his return to England he set about and accomplished a translation of Thucydides who appeared to him preferable to all other Greek historians and by rendering him into English he meant to shew his countrymen from the Athenian history the disorders and confusions of a democratical government  In the year the earl of Devonshire dying after our author had served him years he travelled again into France with a son of Sir Gervas Clifton at which time and during which preregrination says Wood  'he began to make an inspection into the elements of Euclid and be delighted with his method not only for the theorems contained in it but for his art of reasoning'  In these studies he continued till when his late pupil the earl of Devonshire called him home in order to undertake the education of his son then only thirteen years of age in all the parts of juvenile literature and as soon as it was proper for him to see the world Hobbs again set out for France and Italy and directed his young pupil to the necessary steps for accomplishing his education  When our author was at Paris he began to search into the fundamentals of natural science and contracted an intimacy with Marius Marsennus a Minim conversant in that kind of philosophy and a man of excellent moral qualities  In he was recalled to England but finding the civil war ready to break out and the Scots in arms against the King instigated by a mean cowardice he deserted his country in distress and returned to Paris that he might without interruption pursue his studies there and converse with men of  eminence in the sciences The Parliament prevailing several of the Royalists were driven from their own country and were obliged to take shelter in France The Prince of Wales was reduced likewise to quit the kingdom and live at Paris Hobbs was employed to teach the young Prince mathematics in which he made great proficiency and our author  sed to observe that if the Prince's application was equal  o the quickness of his parts he would be the foremost man in his time in every species of science All the leisure hours that Hobbs enjoyed in Paris he dedicated to the composition of a Look called The Leviathan a work by which he acquired a great name in Europe and which was printed at London while he remained at Paris Under this strange name he means the body politic The divines of the church of England who attended King Charles II in France exclaimed vehemently against this performance and said that it contained a great many impious assertions and that the author was not of the royal party Their complaints were regarded and Hobbs was discharged the court and as he had extremely provoked the Papists he thought it not safe for him to continue longer in France especially as he was deprived of the protection of the King of England He translated his Leviathan into Latin and printed it with an appendix in  About ten years afterwards the Leviathan was printed in Low Dutch The character of this work is drawn as under by bishop Burnet  'His Hobbs's main principles were that all men acted under an absolute necessity in which he seemed protected by the then received doctrine of absolute decrees He seemed to think that the universe was god and that souls were material Thought being only subtle and imperceptible motion He thought interest and fear were the chief principles of society and he put all morality in the following that which was our own private will  or advantage He thought religion had no other foundation than the laws of the land and he put all the law in the will of the Prince or of the people For he writ his book at first in favour of absolute monarchy but turned it afterwards to gratify the Republican party'  Upon his return to England he lived retired at the seat of the earl of Devonshire and applied himself to the study of philosophy and as almost all men who have written any thing successfully would be thought poets so Hobbs laid claim to that character tho' his poetry is too contemptible for critcism Dr White Kennet in his memoirs of the family of Cavendish informs us  'That while Mr Hobbs lived in the earl of Devonshire's family his professed rule was to dedicate the morning to his health and the afternoon to his studies and therefore at his first rising he walked out and climbed any hill within his reach or if the weather was not dry he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other till he was in a sweat recommending that practice upon his opinion that an old man had more moisture than heat and therefore by such motion heat was to be acquired and moisture expelled after this he took a breakfast and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl the countess and the children and any considerable strangers paying some short addresses to them all He kept these rounds till about o'clock when he had a little dinner provided for him which he eat always by himself without ceremony Soon after dinner he retired into his study and had his candle with ten or twelve pipes of tobacco laid by him then shutting the door he fell to smoaking and thinking and writing for several hours'  He retained a friend or two at court to protect him if occasion should require and used to say it was lawful to make use of evil instruments to do ourselves good  'If I were cast said he into  a deep pit and the Devil should put down his cloven foot I should take hold of it to be drawn out by it'  Towards the end of his life he read very few books and the earl of Clarendon says that he had never read much but thought a great deal and Hobbs himself used to observe that if he had read as much as other philosophers he should have been as ignorant as they If any company came to visit him he would be free of his discourse and behave with pleasantry till he was pressed or contradicted and then he had the infirmities of being short and peevish and referring them to his writings for better satisfaction His friends who had the liberty of introducing strangers to him made these terms with them before admission that they should not dispute with the old man or contradict him  In October when proceedings against him were depending with a bill against atheism and profaneness he was at Chatsworth and appeared extremely disturbed at the news of it fearing the messengers would come for him and the earl of Devonshire would deliver him up the two houses of Parliament commit him to the bishops and they decree him a heretic This terror upon his spirits greatly disturbed him He often confessed to those about him that he meant no harm was no obstinate man and was ready to make any satisfaction for his prevailing principle and resolution was to suffer for no cause whatever  Under these apprehensions of danger he drew up in an historical naration of heresy and the punishments thereof endeavouring to prove that there was no authority to determine heresy or to punish it when he wrote the Leviathan  Under the same fears he framed an apology for himself and his writings observing that the exceptionable things in his Leviathan were not his opinions so much as his suppositions humbly submited  to those who had the ecclesiastical power and never since dogmatically maintained by him either in writing or discourse and it is much to be suspected as Dr Kennet observes that upon this occasion he began to make a more open shew of religion and church communion He now frequented the chapel joined in the service and was generally a partaker of the sacrament and when any strangers used to call in question his belief he always appealed to his conformity in divine service and referred them to the chaplain for a testimony of it Others thought it a meer compliance with the orders of the family and observed he never went to any parish church and even in the chapel upon sundays he went out after prayers and would not condescend to hear the sermon and when any friend asked the reason of it he gave no other answer but this that preachers could tell him nothing but what he knew He did not conceal his hatred to the clergy but it was visible his aversion proceeded from the dread of their civil power and interest He had often a jealousy that the bishops would burn him and of all the bench he was most afraid of Dr Seth Ward bishop of Sarum because he had most offended him Dr Kennet further observes that his whole life was governed by his fears  In the first Parliament of while it seemed to favour the measures of the court he wrote a little tract in English wherein he demonstrated as himself tells us that all the power and rights necessary for the peace of the kingdom were inseparably annexed to the sovereignty of the King's person But in the second parliament of that year when they proceeded fiercely against those who had written or preached in defence of the regal power he was the first that fled went over into France and there continued eleven years Whether from  the dread of assassination or as some have thought  from the notion of ghosts and spirits is uncertain but he could not endure to be left in an empty house whenever the earl of Devonshire removed he would accompany him even in his last stage from Chatsworth to Hardwick when in a weak condition he dared not be left behind but made his way upon a feather bed in a coach tho' he survived the journey but a few days He could not bear any discourse of death and seemed to cast off all thoughts of it he delighted to reckon upon longer life The winter before he died he had a warm coat made him which he said must last him three years and then he would have such another A few days after his removal to Hardwick Wood says that he was struck with a dead palsy which stupified his right side from head to foot depriving him of his speech and reason at the same time but this circumstance is not so probable since Dr Kennet has told us that in his last sickness he frequently enquired whether his disease was curable and when it was told him that he might have ease but no remedy he used these expressions  'I shall be glad then to find a hole to creep out of the world at'  which are reported to be his last sensible words and his lying some days followin a state of stupefaction seemed to be owing to his mind more than to his body The only thought of death which he appeared to entertain in time of health was to take care of some inscription on his grave he would suffer some friends to dictate an epitaph amongst which he was best pleased with these words  " This is the true Philosopher's Stone"  He died at Hardwick as abovementioned on the th of Dec Notwithstanding his great age  for he exceeded at his death he retained his judgment in great vigour till his last sickness  Some writers of his life maintain that he had very orthodox notions concerning the nature of God and of all the moral virtues notwithstanding the general notion of his being a downright atheist that he was affable kind communicative of what he knew a good friend a good relation charitable to the poor a lover of justice and a despiser of money This last quality is a favourable circumstance in his life for there is no vice at once more despicable and the source of more base designs than avarice His warmest votaries allow that when he was young he was addicted to the fashionable libertinism of wine and women and that he kept himself unmarried lest wedlock should interrupt him in the study of philosophy  In the catalogue of his faults meanness of spirit and cowardice may be justly imputed to him Whether he was convinced of the truth of his philosophy no man can determine but it is certain that he had no resolution to support and maintain his notions had his doctrines been of ever so much consequence to the world Hobbs would have abjured them all rather than have suffered a moment's pain on their account Such a man may be admired for his invention and the planning of new systems but the world would never have been much illuminated if all the discoverers of truth like the philosopher of Malmsbury had had no spirit to assert it against opposition In a piece called the Creed of Mr Hobbs examined in a feigned Conference between him and a Student of Divinity London written by Dr Tenison afterwards archbishop of Canterbury the Dr charges Mr Hobbs with affirming  'that God is a bodily substance though most refined and forceth evil upon the very wills of men framed a model of government pernicious in its consequences  to all nations subjected the canon of scripture to the civil powers and taught them the way of turning the Alcoran into the Gospel declared it lawful not only to dissemble but firmly to renounce faith in Christ in order to avoid persecution and even managed a quarrel against the very elements of Euclid'  Hobbs's Leviathan met with many answers immediately after the restoration especially one by the earl of Clarendon in a piece called a Brief View and Survey of the dangerous and pernicious Errors to Church and State in Mr Hobbs's Book entitled Leviathan Oxon The university of Oxford condemned his Leviathan and his Book de Cive by a decree passed on the st of July and ordered them to be publickly burnt with several other treatises excepted against  The following is a catalogue of his works with as full an account of them as consists with our plan  He translated into English the History of the Grecian War by Thucydides London and in fol and since reprinted in two volumes in octavo  De Mirabilibus Pecci a Latin Poem printed at London it was translated into English by a person of quality and the translation was published with the original at London  Elementa Philosophica seu Politica de Cive id est de Vita civili politicâ prudenter instituendâ Paris in to Mr Hobbs printed but a few copies of this book and revised it afterwards and made several additions to it with which improvements it was printed at Amsterdam under the direction of Monsieur Forbier who published a French translation of it Dr John Bramhall bishop of Derry in Ireland in the Preface to his Book entitled a Defence of true Liberty  from an antecedent and extrinsical Necessity tell us  'that ten years before he had given Mr Hobbs about sixty exceptions one half political and the other half theological to that book and every exception justified by a number of reasons to which he never yet vouchsafed any answer'  Gassendus in a letter to Sorbiere tells us that our author's Book de Cive deserves to be read by all who would have a deep insight into the subject Puffendorf observes that he had been much obliged to

the most beautiful As for its being a close translation I doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds  not from the following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned He sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness His poetry like Ogilby's is too mean for criticism'  He left behind likewise several MSS Mr Francis Peck has published two original Letters of our author the first is dated at Paris October in which he resolves the following question Why a man remembers less his own face which he sees often in a glass than the face of a friend he has not seen a great time The other Letter is dated at Florence addressed to his friend Mr Glen and relates to Dr Heylin's History of the Sabbath  Thus have we given some account of the life and writings of the famous Philosopher of Malmsbury who made so great a figure in the age in which he lived but who in the opinion of some of the best writers of that time was more distinguished for his knowledge than his morals and there have not been wanting those who have declared that the lessons of voluptuousness and libertinism with which he poisoned the mind of the young King Charles II had so great an effect upon the morals of that Prince that our nation dearly suffered by this tutorage in having its wealth and treasure squandered by that luxurious Monarch Hobbs seems not to have been very amiable in his life he was certainly incapable of true friendship for the same cowardice or false principle which could instigate him to abandon truth would likewise teach him to sacrifice his friend to his own safety When young he was voluptuous when old peevish destitute alike of resolution and honour However high his powers his character is mean he flattered the prevailing follies he gave up virtue to  fashion and if he can be produced as a miracle of learning he can never be ranked with those venerable names who have added virtue to erudition and honour to genius who have illuminated the world by their knowledge and reformed it by example  Sir ASTON COKAINE  A Gentleman who lived in the reign of Charles I He was son of Thomas Cokaine  Esq  and descended from a very ancient family at Ashbourne in the Peak of Derbyshire born in the year and educated at both the universities  Athen Oxon p vol ii  Mr Langbaine observes that Sir Aston's predecessors had some evidence to prove themselves allied to William the Conqueror and in those days lived at Hemmingham Castle in Essex He was a fellowcommoner at Trinity College in Cambridge as he himself confesseth in one of his books After he had left the university he went to the Inns of Court where continuing awhile sor fashion's sake he travelled afterwards with Sir Kenelm Digby into France Italy Germany c and was absent the space of twelve years an account of which he has written to his son  Wood ubi supra  but it does not appear to have been printed He lived the greatest part of his time in a lordship belonging to him called Pooley in the parish of Polesworth in Warwickshire and addicted himself much to  books and the study of poetry During the civil wars he suffered much for his religion which was that of Rome and the King's cause he pretended then to be a baronet created by King Charles I after by violence he had been drawn from the Parliament about June yet he was not deemed so by the officers of the army because no patent was enrolled to justify it nor any mention of it made in the docquct books belonging to the clerk of the crown in Chancery where all Patents are taken notice of which pass the Great Seal Sir Aston was esteemed by some a good poet and was acknowledged by all a great lover of the polite arts he was addicted to extravagance for he wasted all he had which though he suffered in the civil wars he was under no necessity of doing from any other motive but profusion  Amongst our author's other poetical productions he has written three plays and a masque which are in print which we shall give in the same order with Mr Langbaine  A Masque presented at Bretbie in Derbyshire on TwelfthNight This Entertainment was presented before the Right Honourable Philip first Earl of Chesterfield and his Countess two of their sons acting in it  The Obstinate Lady a Comedy printed in vo London Langbaine observes that Sir Aston's Obstinate Lady seems to be a cousin Jerman to Massinger's Very Woman as appears by comparing the characters  The Tragedy of Ovid printed in vo 'I know not says Mr Langbaine why the author calls this Ovid's Tragedy except that he lays the scene in Tomos and makes him fall down dead with grief at the news he received from Rome  in sight of the audience otherwise he has not much business on the stage and the play ought rather to have taken the name of Bassane's Jealousy and the dismal Effects thereof the Murder of his new Bride Clorina and his Friend Pyrontus'  Trapolin creduto Principe or Trapolin supposed a Prince an Italian TragiComedy printed in vo London The design of this play is taken from one he saw acted at Venice during his abode in that city it has been since alter  d by Mr Tate and acted at the Theatre in DorsetGarden it is now acted under the title of Duke and No Duke  He has written besides his plays  What he calls a Chain of Golden Poems embellished with Mirth Wit and Eloquence Another title put to these runs thus Choice Poems of several sorts Epigrams in three Books He translated into English an Italian Romance called Dianea printed at London  Sir Aston died at Derby upon the breaking of the great Frost in February and his body being conveyed to Polesworth in Warwickshire besorementioned was privately buried there in the chancel of the church His lordship of Pooley which had belonged to the name of Cokaine from the time of King Richard II was sold several years before he died to one Humphrey Jennings  esq  at which time our author reserved an annuity from it during life The lordship of Ashbourne also was sold to Sir William Boothby baronet There is an epigram of his directed to his honoured friend Major William Warner which we shall here transcribe as a specimen of his poetry whichthe reader will perceive is not very admirable  Plays eclogues songs

Westmoreland and born at KirbyKendal in that county the th of April spent some time at Oxford and had so strong a propensity to the study of astronomy and mathematics that little or no knowledge of logic and philosophy was acquired by him  Wood Athen Oxon v ii  After this being possessed of some patrimony he retired from the university and indulged his genius till the breaking out of the civil wars when he grew impatient of sollitude and being of very loyal principles turned all his inheritance into money and raised for his Majesty a gallant troop of horse of which he himself was captain  After several generous hazards of his person he was routed about the st of March near Stow on the Would in Gloucesteshire where Sir Jacob Astley was taken prisoner and Sir George himself received several scars of honour which he carried to his grave  Wood ubi supra  After this he retired to Oxford the then residence of the King and had in recompence of his losses an employment conferred upon him under Sir John Heydon then lieutenantgeneral of the ordnance which was to receive and pay off money for the service of the magazine and artillery at which time Sir Edward Sherborne was commissarygeneral of it It was then that at leisure hours he followed his studies was deemed a member of Queen'sCollege being entered among the students there and might with other officers have had the degree of master of arts conferred on him by the members of the venerable convocation but neglected it After the surrender of the ga  son of Oxford from which time the royal cause daily declined our author was reduced to live upon expedients he came to London and in order to gain a livelihood he wrote several little things which giving offence to those in power he was seized on and imprisoned first in the Gatehouse then in Newgate and at length in Windsor Castle at which time when he expected the severest stroke of an incensed party to fall upon him he found William Lilly who had formerly been his antagonist now his friend whose humanity and tenderness he amply repaid after the restoration when he was made treasurer and paymaster of his Majesty's ordnance and Lilly stood prescribed as a rebel Sir George who had formerly experienced the calamity of want and having now an opportunity of retrieving  his fortune did not let it slip but so improved it that he was able to purchase an estate and in recompence of his s  edfast suffering and firm adherence to the cause of Charles I and the services he rendered Charles II he was created a baronet by patent dated st of December  Sir George was esteemed what in those days was called a good astrologer and Wood calls him in his usual quaint manner a thorough paced loyalist a boon companion and a waggish poet He died in the year at his house at Enfield in Middlesex and left behind him the name of a loyal subject and an honest man a generous friend and a lively wit  We shall now enumerate his works and are sorry we have not been able to recover any of his poems in order to present the reader with a specimen Such is commonly the fate of temporary wit levelled at some prevailing enormity which is not of a general nature but

was born in St Martin'sLane in London a little before the restoration of King Charles II and was christened in a private chamber the offices of the Common prayer not being then publickly allowed She gave the earliest discoveries of a great genius which being improved by the advantage of a polite education she became eminent in the  of poetry and painting and had her life been prolonged she might probably have excelled most of the prosession in both  Ballard's Memoirs of Learned Ladies  Mr Dryden is quite lavish in her praise and we are assured by other cotemporary writers of good probity that he has done no violence to truth in the most heightened strains of his panegyric let him be voucher for her skill in poetry  Art she had none yet wanted none  For nature did that art supply  So rich in treasures of her own  She might our boasted stores defy  Such noble vigour did her verse adorn  That it seem'd borrow'd where 'twas only born  That great poet is pleased to attribute to her every poetical excellence Speaking of the purity and chastity of her compositions he bestows on them this commendation  Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd  Unmix'd with foreign filth and undefil'd  Her wit was more than man her innocence a child  She was a great proficient in the art of painting and drew King James II and his Queen which pieces are also highly applauded by Mr Dryden She drew several history pieces also some po  traits for her diversion exceeding well and likewise some pieces of still life  Those engaging and polite accomplishments were the least of her perfections for she crowned all with an exemplary piety and unblemished virtue She was one of the maids of honour to the Duchess of York and died of the smallpox in the very flower of her age to the unspeakable grief of her relations and acquaintance on the th day of June in her th year  On this occasion Mr Dryden's muse put on a mournful habit and in one of the most melting elegiac odes that ever was written has consigned her to immortality  In the eighth stanza he does honour to another female character whom he joins with this sweet poetess  Now all those charms that blooming grace  The wellproportion'd shape and beauteous face  Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes  In earth the much lamented virgin lies  Not wit nor piety could fate prevent  Nor was the cruel destiny content  To finish all the murder at a blow  To sweep at once her life and beauty too  But like a hardened felon took a pride  To work more mischievously slow  And plundered first and then destroy'd  O double sacrilege on things divine  To rob the relique and deface the shrine  But thus Orinda died  Heav'n by the same disease did both translate  As equal was their souls so equal was their sate  Miss Killegrew was buried in the chancel of St Baptist's chapel in the Savoy hospital on the North side of which is a very neat monument of marble and freestone fixed in the wall with a Latin inscription a translation of which into English is printed before her poems  The following verses of Miss Killegrew's were addressed to Mrs Philips  Orinda Albion and her sex's grace  Ow'd not her glory to a beauteous face  It was her radiant soul that shone within  Which struck a lustre thro' her outward skin  That did her lips and checks with roses dye  Advanc'd her heighth and sparkled in her eye  Nor did her sex at all obstruct her fame  But high'r 'mongst the stars it fixt her name  What she did write not only all allow'd  But evr'y laurel to her laurel bow'd  Soon after her death her Poems were published in a large thin quarto to which Dryden's ode in praise of the author is prefixed  NAT LEE  THIS eminent dramatic poet was the son of a clergyman of the church of England and was educated at Westminster school under Dr Busby After he left this school he was some time at Trinity College Cambridge whence returning to London he went upon the stage as an actor  Very few particulars are preserved concerning Mr Lee He died before he was years of age and wrote eleven tragedies all of which contain the divine enthusiasm of a poet a noble fire and elevation and the tender breathings of love beyond many of his cotemporaries He seems to have been born to write for the Ladies none ever felt the passion of love more intimately none ever knew to describe it more gracefully and no poet ever moved the breasts of his audience with stronger palpitations than Lee The excellent Mr Addison whose opinion in a matter of this sort is of the greatest weight speaking of the genius of Lee thus proceeds  Spectator No vol st    "Among our modern English poets there is none who was better turned for tragedy than our author if instead of favouring the impetuosity of his genius he had restrained it and kep  it within proper bounds His thoughts are wonderfully suited for tragedy but frequently lost in such a cloud of words that it is hard to see the beauty of them There is an infinite fire in his works but so involved in smoke that it does not appear in half its lustre He  frequently succeeds in the passionate part of the tragedy but more particularly where he slackens his efforts and eases the stile of those epithets and metaphors in which he so much abounds"  It is certain that our author for some time was deprived of his senses and was confined in Bedlam and as Langbaine observes it is to be regretted that his madness exceeded that divine fury which Ovid mentions and which usually accompany the best poets  Est Deus in nobus agitante calescimus illo  His condition in Bedlam was far worse in a Satire on the Poets it is thus described  There in a den remov'd from human eyes  Possest with muse the brainsick poet lies  Too miserably wretched to be nam'd  For plays for heroes and for passion fam'd  Thoughtless he raves his sleepless hours away  In chains all night in darkness all the day  And if he gets some intervals from pain  The fit returns he foams and bites his chain  His eye balls roll and he grows mad again  The reader may please to observe the two last lines are taken from Lee himself in his description of madness in Caesar Borgia which is inimitable Dryden has observed that there is a pleasure in being mad which madmen only know and indeed Lee has described the condition in such lively terms that a man can almost imagine himself in the situation  To my charm'd ears no more of woman tell  Name not a woman and I shall be well  Like a poor lunatic that makes his moan  And for a while beguiles his lookers on  He reasons wellHis eyes their wildness lose  He vows the keepers his wrong'd sense abuse  But if you hit the cause that hurt his brain  Then his teeth gnash he foams he shakes his chain  His eyeballs roll and he is mad again  If we may credit the earl of Rochester Mr Lee was addicted to drinking for in a satire of his in imitation of Sir John Suckling's Session of the Poets which like the original is destitute of wit poetry and good manners he charges him with it  The lines miserable as they are we shall insert  Nat Lee stept in next in hopes of a prize  Apollo remembring he had hit once in thrice  By the rubies in's face he could not deny  But he had as much wit as wine could supply  Confess'd that indeed he had a musical note  But sometimes strain'd so hard that it rattled in the throat  Yet own'd he had sense and t' encourage him for't  He made him his Ovid in Aúgustus's court  The testimony of Rochester indeed is of no great value for he was governed by no principles of honour and as his ruling passion was malice he was ready on all occasions to indulge it at the expence of truth and sincerity We cannot ascertain whether our author wrote any of his plays in Bedlam tho it is not improbable he might have attempted something that way in his intervals  Mad people have often been observed to do very ingenious things I have seen a ship of  straw finely fabricated by a mad shipbuilder and the most lovely attitudes have been represented by a mad statuary in his cell  Lee for aught we know might have some noble flights of fancy even in Bedlam and it is reported of him that while he was writing one of his scenes by moonlight a cloud intervening he cried out in extasy  "Jove snuff the Moon"  but as this is only related upon common report we desire no more credit may be given to it than its own nature demands We do not pretend notwithstanding our high opinion of Lee to desend all his rants and extravagancies some of them are ridiculous some bombast and others unintelligible but this observation by no means holds true in general for tho' some passages are too extravagant yet others are nobly sublime we had almost said unequalled by any other poet  As there are not many particulars preserved of Lee's life we think ourselves warranted to enlarge a little upon his works and therefore we beg leave to introduce to our reader's acquaintance a tragedy which perhaps he has not for some time heard of written by this great man viz Lucius Junius Brutus the Father of his country  We mention this tragedy because it is certainly the finest of Lee's and perhaps one of the most moving plays in our language Junius Brutus engages in the just defence of the injured rights of his country against Tarquin the Proud he succeeds in driving him out of Rome His son Titus falls in love and interchanges vows with the tyrant's daughter his father commands him not to touch her nor to correspond with her he faithfully promises but his resolutions are baffled by the insinuating and irresistable charms of Teraminta he is won by her beauties he joins in the attempt to restore Tarquin the enterprize  miscarries and his own father sits in judgment upon him and condemns him to suffer  The interview between the father and son is inexpressibly moving and is only exceeded by that between the son and his Teraminta Titus is a young hero struggling between love and duty Teraminta an amiable Roman lady fond of her husband and dutiful to her father  There are throughout this play we dare be bold to affirm as affecting scenes as ever melted the hearts of an audience Why it is not revived may be difficult to account for Shall we charge it to want of taste in the town or want of discernment in the managers or are our present actors conscious that they may be unequal to some of the parts in it yet were Mr Quin engaged at either theatre to do the author justice in the character of Brutus we are not wanting in a Garrick or a Barry to perform the part of Titus nor is either stage destitute of a Teraminta This is one of those plays that Mr Booth proposed to revive with some few alterations had he lived to return to the stage And the part of Brutus was what he purposed to have appeared in  As to Lee's works they are in every body's hands so that we need not trouble the reader with a list of them  In his tragedy of the Rival Queens our author has shewn what he could do on the subject of Love he has there almost exhausted the passion painted it in its various forms and delineated the workings of the human soul when influenced by it  He makes Statira thus speak of Alexander  Not the spring's mouth nor breath of Jessamin  Nor Vi'lets infant sweets nor op'ning buds  Are half so sweet as Alexander's breast  From every pore of him a perfume falls  He kisses softer than a Southern wind  Curls like a Vine and touches like a God  Then he will talk good Gods how he will talk  Even when the joy he sigh'd for is possess'd  He speaks the kindest words and looks such things  Vows with such passion swears with so much grace  That 'tis a kind of Heaven to be deluded by him  If I but mention him the tears will fall  Sure there is not a letter in his name  But is a charm to melt a woman's eyes  His Tragedy of Theodosius or the Force of Love is the only play of Lee's that at present keeps possession of the stage an argument in my opinion not much in favour of our taste that a Genius should be so neglected  It is said that Lee died in the night in the streets upon a frolic and that his father never assisted him in his frequent and pressing necessity which he was able to do It appears that tho' Lee was a player yet for want of execution he did not much succeed though Mr Cibber says that he read excellently and that the players used to tell him unless they could act the part as he read it they could not hope success which it seems was not the case with Dryden who could hardly read to be understood Lee was certainly a man of great genius when it is considered how young he died he performed miracles and had he lived 'till his fervour cooled and his judgment strengthened which might have been the consequence of years he would have made a greater figure in poetry than some of his contemporaries who are now placed in a superior rank  SAMUEL BUTLER  THE celebrated author of Hudibras was born at Strensham in Worcestershire His father a reputable country farmer perceiving in his son an early inclination to learning sent him for education to the freeschool of Worcester under the care of Mr Henry Bright where having laid the foundation of grammar learning he was sent for some time to Cambridge but was never matriculated in that university  Life of Butler p  After he had resided there six or seven years he returned to his native country and became clerk to Mr Jefferys of Earl'sCroom an eminent justice of the peace for that county with whom he lived for some years in an easy though for such a genius no very reputable service during which time through the indulgence of a kind master he had sufficient leisure to apply himself to his favourite studies history and poetry to which for his diversion he added music and painting  The anonymous author of Butler's Life tells us that he had seen some pictures of his drawing which were preserved in Mr Jefferys's family which I mention not says he  'for the excellency of them but to satisfy the reader of his early inclination to that noble art for which also he was afterwards entirely loved by Mr Samuel  Cooper one of the most eminent Painters of his time'  Wood places our poet's improvement in music and painting to the time of his service under the countess of Kent by whose patronage he had not only the opportunity of consulting all kinds of books but conversing also with the great Mr Selden who has justly gained the epithet of a living library of learning and was then conversant in that lady's family and who often employed our poet to write letters beyond sea and translate for him He lived some time also with Sir Samuel Luke a gentleman of a good family in Bedfordshire and a famous commander under Oliver Cromwel  Much about this time he wrote says the author of his Life  'the renowned Hudibras as he then had opportunities of conversing with the leaders of that party whose religion he calls hypocrisy whose politics rebellion and whose speeches nonsense'  he was of an unshaken loyalty though he was placed in the house of a rebel and it is generally thought that under the character of Hudibras he intended to ridicule Sir Samuel Luke After the restoration of Charles II he was made secretary to the earl of Carbury lord president of the principality of Wales who appointed him steward of Ludlow Castle when the court was revived there and about this time he married one Mrs Herbert a gentlewoman of very good family Anthony Wood says she was a widow and that Butler supported himself by her jointure for though in his early years he had studied the common law yet he had made no advantage by the practice of it but others assert that she was not a widow and that though she had a competent fortune it proved of little or no advantage to Butler as most of it was unfortunately lost by being put out on bad security Mr Wood likewise says that he was secretary to the  duke of Buckingham when that lord was chancellor of the university of Cambridge and the life writer assures us he had a great kindness for him but the late ingenious major Richardson Pack tells a story which if true overthrows both their assertions and as it is somewhat particular we shall give it a place here Mr Wycherley had taken every opportunity to represent to his grace the duke of Buckingham how well Mr Butler had deserved of the Royal Family by writing his inimitable Hudibras and that it was a reproach to the court that a person of his loyalty and wit should languish in obscurity under so many wants The duke seemed always to hearken to him with attention and after some time undertook to recommend his pretensions to his Majesty Mr Wycherly in hopes to keep him steady to his word obtained of his Grace to name a day when he might introduce that modest unfortunate poet to his new patron at last an appointment was made Mr Butler and his friend attended accordingly the duke joined them But as the devil would have it says the major  'the door of the room where he sat was open and his Grace who had seated himself near it observing a pimp of his acquaintance the creature too was a knight trip by with a brace of ladies immediately quitted his engagement to follow another kind of business at which he was more ready than at doing good offices to men of desert though no one was better qualified than he both in regard to his fortune and understanding to protect them and from that hour to the day of his death poor Butler never found the least effect of his promise and descended to the grave oppressed with want and poverty'  The excellent lord Buckhurst the late earl of Dorset and Middlesex was a friend to our poet who as he was a man of wit and parts himself  knew how to set a just value on those who excelled He had also promises of places and employment from lord chancellor Clarendon but as if poor Butler had been doomed to misfortunes these proved  Posthumous Works of Wy  herly published by Mr Theobald  meer court promises Mr Butler in short affords a remarkable instance of that coldness and neglect which great genius's often experience from the court and age in which they live we are told indeed by a gentleman whose father was intimate with Butler Charles Longueville  Esq  that Charles II once gave him a gratuity of three hundred pounds which had this compliment attending it that it passed all the offices without any fee lord Danby being at that time high treasurer which seems to be the only court favour he ever received a strange instance of neglect when we consider King Charles was so excessive fond of this poem of Hudibras that he carried it always in his pocket he quoted it almost on every occasion and never mentioned it but with raptures  This is movingly represented in a poem of our author's published in his remains called Hudibras at Court He takes occasion to justify his poem by hinting its excellences in general and paying a few modest compliments to himself of which we shall transcribe the following lines  Now you must know sir Hudibras  With such perfections gifted was  And so peculiar in his manner  That all that saw him did him honour  Amongst the rest this prince was one  Admired his conversation  This prince whose ready wit and parts  Conquer'd both men and women's hearts  Was so o'ercome with knight and Ralph  That he could never claw it off  He never eat nor drank nor slept  But Hudibras still near him kept  Nor would he go to church or so  But Hudibras must with him go  Nor yet to visit concubine  Or at a city feast to dine  But Hudibras must still be there  Or all the fat was in the fire  Now after all was it not hard  That he should meet with no reward  That fitted out the knight and squire  This monarch did so much admire  That he should never reimburse  The man for th' equipage and horse  Is sure a strange ungrateful thing  In any body but a King  But this good King it seems was told  By some that were with him too bold  If e'er you hope to gain your ends  Caress your foes and trust your friends  Such were the doctrines that were taught  'Till this unthinking King was brought  To leave his friends to starve and die  A poor reward for loyalty  After having lived to a good old age admired by all though personally known but to few he died September and was buried at the expence of his good friend Mr Longueville of the Temple in the churchyard of St Paul's CoventGarden Mr Longueville had a strong inclination to have him buried in WestminsterAbbey and spoke with that view to several persons who had been his admirers offering to pay his part but none of them would contribute upon which he was interred privately Mr Longueville and seven or eight more following him to the grave  Mr Alderman Barber erected a monument to Butler in WestminsterAbbey  The poem entitled Hudibras by which he acquired so high a reputation was published at three different times the first part came out in in vo afterwards came out the second part and both were printed together with several additions and annotations at last the third and last part was published but without any annotations as appears by the printed copy The great success and peculiarity of manner of this poem has produced many unsuccessful imitations of it and some vain attempts have been made to translate some parts of it into Latin Monsieur Voltaire gives it a very good character and justly observes that though there are as many thoughts as words in it yet it cannot be successfully translated on account of every line's having some allusion to English affairs which no foreigner can be supposed to understand or enter into The Oxford antiquary ascribes to our author two pamphlets supposed falsely he says to be William Prynne's the one entitled Mola Asinaria or the Unreasonable and Insupportable Burthen pressed upon the Shoulders of this Groaning Nation London in one sheet to the other Two Letters One from John Audland a Quaker to William Prynne the other Prynne's Answer in three sheets fol The life writer mentions a small poem in one sheet in to on Du Val a notorious highwayman said to be written by Butler These pieces with a great many others are published together under the title of his Posthumous Works The life writer abovementioned has preserved a fragment of Mr Butler's given by one whom he calls the ingenious Mr Aubrey who assured him he had it from the poet himself it is indeed admirable and the satire sufficiently pungent against the priests  No jesuit e'er took in hand  To plant a church in barren land  Nor ever thought it worth the while  A Swede or Russ to reconcile  For where there is no store of wealth  Souls are not worth the charge of health  Spain in America had two designs  To sell their gospel for their mines  For had the Mexicans been poor  No Spaniard twice had landed on their shore  'Twas gold the Catholic religion planted  Which had they wanted gold they still had wanted  Mr Dryden  Juv Ded  and Mr Addison  Spect No Vol i  have joined in giving testimony against our author as to the choice of his verse which they condemn as boyish and being apt to degenerate into the doggrel but while they censure his verse they applaud his matter and Dryden observes that had he chose any other verse he would even then have excelled as we say of a court favourite that whatever his office be he still makes it uppermost and most beneficial to him  We cannot close the life of this great man without a reflection on the degeneracy of those times which suffered him to languish in obscurity and though he had done more against the Puritan interest by exposing it to ridicule than thousands who were rioting at court with no pretensions to favour yet he was never taken notice of nor had any calamity redrrssed which leaves a stain on those who then ruled that never can be obliterated A minister of state seldom fails to reward a courttool and a man of pleasure pays his instruments for their infamy and what  character must that ministration bear who allow wit loyalty and virtue to pass neglected and as Cowley pathetically expresses it  ' In that year when manna rained on all why should the muses fleece be only dry'  The following epigram is not unworthy a place here  Whilst Butler needy wretch was yet alive  No gen'rous patron would a dinner give  But lo behold when dead the mould'ring dust  Rewarded with a monumental bust  A poet's fate in emblem here is shewn  He ask'd for bread and he receiv'da stone  EDMUND WALLER  Esq  WAS descended of a family of his name in Buckinghamshire a younger branch of the Wallers of Kent He was born March at Coleshill which gives Warwickshire the honour of his birth His father dying when he was very young the care of his education fell to his mother who sent him to Eton school according to the author of his life but Mr Wood says  'that he was mostly educated in grammaticals under one Dobson minister of Great Wycombe in Bucks who had been educated in Eton school'  without mentioning that Mr Waller had been at all at Eton school after he had acquired grammar learning he was removed to King's college in Cambridge and it is manifest that he must have been extremely assiduous in his studies since he acquired so fine a taste of the ancients in so short a time for at sixteen or seventeen years of age he was chosen into the last Parliament of King James I and served as Burgess for Agmondesham  In the year when Prince Charles nearly escaped being cast away in the road of St Andre coming from Spain Mr Waller wrote a Poem on that occasion at an age when generally speaking persons of the acutest parts just begin to shew themselves and at a time when the English poetry had scarce any grace in it In the year he addressed a Poem to his Majesty on his hearing the news of the duke of Buckingham's death which with the former procured him general admiration harmony of numbers being at that time so great a novelty and Mr Waller having at once so polished and refined versification it is no wonder that he enjoyed the felicity of an universal applause These poems recommended him to courtfavour and rendered him dear to persons of the best taste and distinction that then flourished A Writer of his life observes as a proof of his being much caressed by people of the first reputation that he was one of the famous club of which the great lord Falkland Sir Francis Wainman Mr Chillingworth Mr Godolphin and other eminent men were members These were the immortals of that age and to be associated with them is one of the highest encomiums which can possibly be bestowed and exceeds the most laboured strain of a panegyrist  A circumstance related of this club is pretty remarkable One evening when they were convened a great noise was heard in the street which not a little alarmed them and upon enquiring the cause they were told that a son of Ben Johnson's was arrested This club was too generous to suffer the child of one who was the genuine son of Apollo to be carried to a Jail perhaps for a trifle they sent for him but in place of being Ben Johnson's son he proved to be Mr George Morley afterwards bishop of Winchester Mr Waller liked him so well that he paid the debt which  was no less than one hundred pounds on condition that he would live with him at Beconsfield which he did eight or ten years together and from him Mr Waller used to say that he learned a taste of the ancient poets and got what he had of their manner But it is evident from his poems written before this incident of Mr Morley's arrest that he had early acquired that exquisite Spirit however he might have improved it afterwards by the conversation and assistance of Mr Morley to whom this adventure proved very advantageous  It is uncertain at what time our author was married but it is supposed that his first wife Anne daughter and heir of Edward Banks  esq  was dead before he fell in love with lady Dorothy Sidney daughter to the earl of Leicester whom he celebrates under the name of Sacharissa Mr Waller's passion for this lady has been the subject of much conversation his verses addresied to her have been renowned for their delicacy and Sacharissa has been proposed as a model to succeeding poets in the celebration of their mistresses One cannot help wishing that the poet had been as successful in his Addresses to her as he has been in his lovestrains which are certainly the sweetest in the world The difference of station and the pride of blood perhaps was the occasion that Sacharissa never became the wife of Waller though in reality as Mr Waller was a gentleman a member of parliament and a person of high reputation we cannot at present see so great a disproportion and as Mr Waller had fortune as well as wit and poetry lord Leicester's daughter could not have been disgraced by such an alliance At least we are sure of one thing that she lives for ever in Waller's st  ains a circumstance which even her beauty could not have otherwise procured nor the lustre of the earl of Sunderland whom she afterwards married the countess of Sunderland like the radiant circles of that age long before this time  would have slept in oblivion but the Sacharissa of Waller is consigned to immortality and can never die but with poetry taste and politeness  Upon the marriage of that lady to lord Spenser afterwards earl of Sunderland which was solemnized July Mr Waller wrote the following letter to lady Lucy Sidney her sister which is so full of gallantry and so elegantly turned that it will doubtedly give pleasure to our readers to peruse it  MADAM  'In this common joy at Penshurst  The ancient seat of the Sydneys family in Kent now in the possession of William Perry  esq  whose lady is neice to the late Sydney earl of Leicester A small but excellent poem upon this delightful seat was published by an anonymous hand in entitled PENSHURST See Monthly Review vol II page  I know none to whom complaints may come less unseasonable than to your ladyship the loss of a bedfellow being almost equal to that of a mistress and therefore you ought at least to pardon if you consent not to the imprecations of the deserted which just Heaven no doubt will hear May my lady Dorothy if we may yet call her so suffer as much and have the like passion for this young lord whom she has preferred to the rest of mankind as others have had for her and may his love before the year go about make her taste of the first curse imposed upon womankind the pains of becoming a mother May her first born be none of her own sex nor so like her but that he may resemble her lord as much as herself May she that always affected silence and retirement have the house filled with the noise and number of her children and hereafter of her grandchildren and then may  she arrive at that great curse so much declined by fair ladies old age may she live to be very old and yet seem young be told so by her glass and have no aches to inform her of the truth and when she shall appear to be mortal may her lord not mourn for her but go hand in hand with her to that place where we are told there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage that being there divorced we may all have an equal interest in her again my revenge being immortal I wish all this may befal her posterity to the world's end and afterwards To you madam I wish all good things and that this loss may in good time be happily supplied with a more constant bedfellow of the other sex Madam I humbly kiss your hands and beg pardon for this trouble from  'Your ladyship's most humble servant E WALLER'  He lived to converse with lady Sunderland when she was very old but his imprecations relating to her glass did not succeed for my lady knew she had the disease which nothing but death could cure and in a conversation with Mr Waller and some other company at lady Wharton's she asked him in raillery  'When Mr Waller will you write such fine verses upon me again'  Oh Madam said he  'when your ladyship is as young again'  In the year Mr Waller was returned Burgess for Agmondesham in which Parliament he opposed the court measures The writer of his  life observes  Lise p    'that an intermission of Parliaments for years disgusted the nation and the House met in no good humour to give money It must be confessed some late proceedings had raised such jealousies as would be sure to discover themselves whenever the King should come to ask for a supply and Mr Waller was one of the first to condemn those measures A speech he made in the House upon this occasion printed at the end of his poems gives us some notion of his principles as to government'  Indeed we cannot but confess he was a little too inconstant in them and was not naturally so steady as he was judicious which variable temper was the cause of his losing his reputation in a great measure with both parties when the nation became unhappily divided His love to poetry and his indolence laid him open to the insinuations of others and perhaps prevented his fixing so resolutely to any one party as to make him a favourite with either As Mr Waller did not come up to the heighths of those who were for unlimited monarchy so he did not go the lengths of such as would have sunk the kingdom into a commonwealth but had so much credit at court that in this parliament the King particularly sent to him to second his demands of some subsidies to pay the army and Sir Henry Vane objecting against first voting a supply because the King would not accept it unless it came up to his proportion Mr Waller spoke earnestly to Sir Thomas Jermyn comptroller of the houshold to save his master from the effects of so bold a falsity for says he I am but a country gentleman and cannot pretend to know the King's mind but Sir Thomas durst not contradict the secretary and his son  the earl of St Alban's afterwards told Mr Waller that his father's cowardice ruined the King  In the latter end of the year he was one of the commissioners appointed by the Parliament to present their propositions for peace to his Majesty at Oxford Mr Whitelocke in his Memorials tells us that when Mr Waller kissed the King's hand in the garden at Christ's Church his Majesty said to him  'though you are last yet you are not the worst nor the least in our favour'  The discovery of a plot continues Mr Whitelocke  'then in hand in London to betray the Parliament wherein Mr Waller was engaged with Chaloner Tomkins and others which was then in agitation did manifest the King's courtship of Mr Waller to be for that service'  In the beginning of the year our poet was deeply engaged in the design for the reducing the city of London and the Tower for the service of his Majesty which being discovered he was imprisoned and fined ten thousand pounds As this is one of the most memorable circumstances in the life of Waller we shall not pass it slightly over but give a short detail of the rise progress and discovery of this plot which issued not much in favour of Mr Waller's reputation  Lord Clarendon observes  History of the Rebellion Edit Oxon vo    'that Mr Waller was a gentleman of very good fortune and estate and of admirable parts and faculties of wit and eloquence and of an intimate conversation and familiarity with those who had that reputation He had from the beginning of the Parliament been looked upon by all men as a person of very entire affections to the King's service and to the established government of church and state and by having no manner of relation to  the court had the more credit and interest to promote the service of it When the ruptures grew so great between the King and the two houses that many of the Members withdrew from those councils he among the rest absented himself but at the time the standard was set up having intimacy and friendship with some persons now of nearness about the King with his Majesty's leave he returned again to London where he spoke upon all occasions with great sharpness and freedom which was not restrained and therefore used as an argument against those who were gone upon pretence that they were not suffered to declare their opinion freely in the House which could not be believed when all men knew what liberty Mr Waller took and spoke every day with impunity against the proceedings of the House this won him a great reputation with all people who wished well to the King and he was looked upon as the boldest champion the crown had in either House so that such Lords and Commons who were willing to prevent the ruin of the kingdom complied in a great familiarity with him as aman resolute in their ends and best able to promote them and it may be they believed his reputation at court so good that he would be no ill evidence there of other men's zeal and affection so all men spoke their minds freely to him both of the general distemper and of the passions and ambition of particular persons all men knowing him to be of too good a fortune and too wary a nature to engage himself in designs of hazard'  Mr Tomkins already mentioned had married Waller's sister and was clerk of the Queen' council and of very good fame for honesty and ability great interest and reputation in the  city and conversed much with those who disliked the proceedings of the Parliament from whom he learned the dispositions of the citizens on all accidents which he freely communicated to his brother Waller as the latter imparted to him whatever observations he made from those with whom he conversed Mr Waller told him that many lords and commons were for a peace Mr Tomkins made the same relation with respect to the most substantial men of London which Mr Waller reported to the well affected members of both houses and Mr Tomkins to the well affected citizens whence they came to a conclusion that if they heartily united in the mutual assistance of one another they should be able to prevent those tumults which seemed to countenance the distractions and both parties would be excited to moderation The lord Conway at that time coming from Ireland incensed against the Scotch discontented with the Parliament here and finding Waller in good esteem with the earl of Norhumberland and in great friendship with the earl of Portland entered into the same familiarity and being a soldier in the discourses they had he insinuated it was convenient to enquire into the numbers of the well affected in the city that they might know whom they had to trust to Mr Waller telling Mr Tomkins this the latter imparted it to his confidents there and it was agreed that some trusty persons in every ward and parish about London should make a list of all the inhabitants and by guessing at their several affections compute the strength of that party which opposed an accommodation and that which was for it  Lord Clarendon declares that he believes this design was to beget such a combination among the well affected parties that they would refuse to conform to those ordinances of the twentieth  part and other taxes for the support of the war and thereby or by joint petitioning for peace and discountenancing the other who petitioned against it to prevail with the Parliament to incline to a determination of the war  'but that there ever was says the earl 'any formed design either of letting the King's army into London which was impossible to be effected or raising an army there and surprizing the Parliament or any person of it or of using any violence in or upon the city I could never yet see cause to believe'  But it unluckily happened that while this combination was on foot Sir Nicholas Crisp procured a commission of array to be sent from Oxford to London which was carried by the lady Aubigny and delivered to a gentleman employed by Sir Nicholas to take it of her and this being discovered at the same time Mr Waller's plot was the two conspiracies were blended into one tho' the earl of Clarendon is satisfied that they were two distinct designs His lordship relates the discovery of Mr Waller's plot in this manner  'A servant of Mr Tomkins who had often cursorily overheard his master and Mr Waller discourse of the subject which we are upon placed himself behind the hangings at a time when they were together and there whilst either of them discovered the language and opinion of the company which they kept overheard enough to make him believe that his information and discovery could make him welcome to those whom he thought concerned and so went to Mr Pym and acquainted him with all he had heard or probably imagined The time when Mr Pym was made acquainted with it is not known but the circumstance of publishing it was such as filled all men with apprehensions'  'It was on Wednesday the st of May their solemn fast day when being all at their sermon in St Margaret's church Westminster according to their custom a letter or message was brought privately to Mr Pym who thereupon with some of the most active members rose from their seats and after a little whispering together removed out of the church This could not but exceedingly affect those who stayed behind Immediately they sent guards to all the prisons at Lambeth house Elyhouse and such places where malignants were in custody with directions to search the prisoners and some other places which they thought fit should be suspected After the sermon was ended the houses met and were only then told that letters were intercepted going to the King and the court at Oxford which expressed some notable conspiracy in hand to deliver up the Parliament and the city into the hands of the Cavaliers and that the time for the execution of it drew near Hereupon a committee was appointed to examine all persons they thought fit and to apprehend some nominated at that time and the same night this committee apprehended Mr Waller and Mr Tomkins and the next day such as they suspected'  The Houses were or seemed to be so alarmed with the discovery of the plot that six days after they took a sacred vow and covenant which was also taken by the city and army denouncing war against the King more directly than they had done before The earl of Portland and lord Conway were imprisoned on Mr Waller's accusation and often confronted with him before the committee where they as peremptorily denying as he charging them and there being no other witness but him against them they were kept a while in restraint and then bailed Mr Waller after he had had  'says  the earl of Clarendon with incredible dissimulation acted such a remorse of conscience that his trial was put off out of christian compassion till he should recover his understanding and that was not till the heat and fury of the prosecutors was abated by the sacrifices they had made and by drawing visitants to himself of the most powerful ministers of all factions had by his liberality and penitence his receiving vulgar and vile sayings from them with humility and reverence as clearer convictions and informations than in his life he had ever had and distributing great sums to them for their prayers and ghostly council so satisfied them that they satisfied others was brought at his suit to the bar of the House of Commons on on the th of July where being a man in truth very powerful in language and who by what he spoke and the manner of speaking it exceedingly captivated the good will and benevolence of his hearers with such flattery as was most exactly calculated to that meridian with such a submission as their pride took delight in and such a dejection of mind and spirit as was like to couzen the major part He laid before them their own danger  nd concernment if they should suffer one of their body how unworthy and monstrous soever to be tried by the soldiers who might thereby grow to such power hereafter that they would both try those they would not be willing should be tried and for things which they would account no crime the inconvenience and insupportable mischief whereof wise commonwealths had soreseen and prevented by exempting their own members from all judgments but their own He prevailed not to be tried by a Council of War and thereby preserved his dearbought life so that in truth he did as much owe the keeping his head to that oration as Cataline did the loss of his to those of Tully and having done ill very  well he by degrees drew that respect to his parts which always carries some compassion to the person that he got leave to compound for his transgression and them to accept of ten thousand pounds for his liberty whereupon he had leave to recollect himself in another country for his liberty was to be banishment how miserable he had made himself in obtaining that leave to live out of his own And there cannot be a greater evidence of the inestimable value of his parts than that he lived in the good affection and esteem of many the pity of most and the reproach and scorn of few or none'  After this storm had subsided Mr Waller travelled into France where he continued several years He took over his lady's jewels to support him and lived very hospitably at Paris and except that of lord Jermyn afterwards earl of St Alban's who was the Queen of England's prime minister when she kept her court there there was no English table but Mr Waller's which was so costly to him that he used to say he was at last come to the Rump 'Jewel' Upon his return to England such was the unsteadiness of his temper he sided with those in power particularly the Lord Protector with whom he lived in great intimacy as a companion tho' he seems not to have acted for him He often declared that he sound Cromwell very well acquainted with the Greek and Roman story and he frequently took notice that in the midst of their discou  se a servant has come to tell him that such and such attended upon which Cromwell would rise and stop them talking at the door where Mr Waller could overhear him say  'The lord will reveal the lord will help'  and several such expressions which when he returned to Mr Waller he excused saying  'Cousin Waller I must talk to these men after their own way'  In he wrote a panegyric on Oliver Cromwell as he did a poem on his death in At the restoration he was treated with great civility by King Charles II who always made him one of his party in his diversions at the duke of Buckingham's and other places and gave him a grant of the provostship of EatonCollege tho' that grant proved of no effect He sat in several Parliaments after the restoration and wrote a panegyric upon his Majesty's return which however was thought to sall much short of that which he before had wrote on Cromwell The King one day asked him in raillery  'How is it Waller that you wrote a better encomium on Cromwell than on me'  May it please your Majesty answered the bard with the most admirable fineness  'Poets generally succeed best in fiction  Mr Waller continued in the full vigour of his genius to the end of his life his natural vivacity bore up against his years and made his company agreeable to the last which appears from the following little story  King James II having ordered the earl of Sunderland to desire Mr Waller to attend him one afternoon when he came the King carried him into his closet and there asked him how he liked such a picture  'Sir says Mr Waller my eyes are dim and I know not whose it is'  The King answered  'It is the Princess of Orange'  and says Mr Waller  'she is like the greatest woman in the world'  'Whom do you call so said the King'  'Queen Elizabeth said he'  'I wonder Mr Waller replied the King you should think so but I must confess she had a wise council'  and Sir said Mr Waller  'did you ever know a Fool chuse a wise one'  Mr Waller died of a dropsy October Finding his distemper encrease and having yielded  all hopes of recovery he ordered his soninlaw Dr Peter Birch to desire all his children to join with him and give him the sacrament He at the same time professed himself a believer in revealed religion with great earnestness telling them that he remembered wh  n the duke of Buckingham once talked profanely before King Charles he told him  'My lord I am a great deal older than your grace and I believe I have heard more arguments for atheism than ever your grace did but I have lived long enough to see there was nothing in them and so I hope will your grace'  It is said that had Mr Waller lived longer he would have inclined to the revolution which by the violent measures of James II he could foresee would happen He was interred in the churchyard of Beaconsfield where a monument is erected to his memory the inscriptions on it were written by Mr Thomas Rymer  He l  several children behind him He bequeathed his estate to his second son Edmund his eldest Benjamin being so far from inheriting his father's wit that he had not a common portion Edmund the second Son used to be chosen member of Parliament for Agmondesham and in the latter part of his life turned Quaker William the third son was a merchant in London and Stephen the fourth a civilian Of the daughters Mary was married to Dr Peter Birch prebendary of Westminster another to Mr Harvey of Suffolk another to Mr Tipping of Oxfordshire  These are the most material circumstances in the life of Mr Waller a man whose wit and parts drew the admiration of the world upon him when he was living and has secured him the applause of posterity As a statesman lord Clarendon is of opinion he wanted steadiness and even insinuates that he was deficient in point of honour the earl at least construes his timidity and apparent  cowardice in a way not very advantageous to him  All men have honoured him as the great refiner of English poetry who restored numbers to the delicacy they had lost and joined to melifluent cadence the charms of sense But as Mr Waller is unexceptionally the first who brought in a new turn of verse and gave to rhime all the graces of which it was capable it would be injurious to his fame not to present the reader with the opinions of some of the greatest men concerning him by which he will be be  ter able to understand his particular excellencies and will see his beauties in full glow before him To begin with Mr Dryden who in his dedication to the Rival Ladies addressed to the earl of Orrery thus characterizes Waller  'The excellency and dignity of rhime were never fully known till Mr Waller sought it He first made writing easily an art first shewed us to conclude the sense most commonly in distichs which in the verses of those before him runs on for so many lines together that the reader is out of breath to overtake it'  Voltaire in his letters concerning the English nation speaking of British poets thus mentions Waller  'Our author was much talked of in France He had much the same reputation in London that Voiture had in Paris and in my opinion deserved it better Voiture was born in an age that was just emerging from barbarity an age that was still rude and ignorant the people of which aimed at wit tho' they had not the least pretensions to it and sought for points and conceits instead of sentiments Bristol stones are more easily found than diamonds Voiture born with an easy and frivolous genius was the first who shone in this Aurora of French literature Had he come into  the world after those great genius's who spread such glory over the age of Lewis XIV he would either have been unknown would have been despised or would have corrected his stile Waller tho' better than Voiture was not yet a finished poet The graces breathe in such of Waller's works as are wrote in a tender strain but then they are languid thro' negligence and often disfigured with false thoughts The English had not at this time attained the art of correct writing but his serious compositions exhibit a strength and vigour which could not have been expected from the softness and effeminacy of his other pieces'  The anonymous author of the preface to the second part of our author's poems printed in the year  has given his character at large and tells us  'That Waller is a name that carries every thing in it that is either great or graceful in poetry He was indeed the parent of English verse and the first who shewed us our tongue had beauty and numbers in it The tongue came into his hands like a rough diamond he polished it first and to that degree that artists since have admired the workmanship without pretending to mend it He undoubtedly stands first in the list of refiners and for ought I know the last too for I question whether in Charles II's reign the English did not come to its full perfection and whether it had not had its Augustan age as well as the Latin'  Thus far this anonymous author If I may be permitted to give my opinion in so delicate a point as the reputation of Waller I shall take the liberty to observe that had he in place of preceding succeeded those great wits who flourished in the reign of Charles II he could never have rose to such great reputation  nor would have deserved it No small honour is due to him for the harmony which he introduced but upon that chiefly does his reputation stand He certainly is sometimes languid he was rather a tender than a violent lover he has not that force of thinking that amazing reach of genius for which Dryden is renowned and had it been his lot to have appeared in the reign of Queen Anne I imagine he would not have been ranked above the second class of poets But be this as it may poetry owes him the highest obligations for refining it and every succeeding genius will be ready to acknowledge that by copying Waller's strains they have improved their own and the more they follow him the more they please  Mr Waller altered the Maid's Tragedy from Fletcher and translated the first Act of the Tragedy of Pompey from the French of Corneille Mrs Katharine Philips in a letter to Sir Charles Cotterell ascribes the translation of the first act to our author and observes that Sir Edward Filmer did one Sir Charles Sidley another lord Buckhurst another but who the fifth says she I cannot learn  Mrs Philips then proceeds to give a criticism on this performance of Waller's shews some faults and points out some beauties with a spirit and candour peculiar to her  The best edition of our author's works is that published by Mr Fenton London containing poems speeches letters c In this edition is added the preface to the first edition of Mr Waller's poems after the restoration printed in the year  As a specimen of Mr Waller's poetry we shall give a transcript of his Panegyric upon Oliver Cromwell  A Panegyric to my Lord PROTECTOR of the present greatness and joint interest of his Highness and this Nation  In the YEAR  WHILE with a strong and yet a gentle hand  You bridle faction and our hearts command  Protect us from our selves and from the foe  Make us unite and make us conquer too  Let partial spirits still aloud complain  Think themselves injur'd that they cannot reign  And own no liberty but where they may  Without controul upon their fellows prey  Above the waves as Neptune shew'd his face  To chide the winds and save the Trojan race  So has your Highness rais'd above the rest  Storms of Ambition tossing us represt  Your drooping country torn with civil hate  Restor'd by you is made a glorious state  The seat of empire where the Irish come  And the unwilling Scotch to fetch their doom  The sea's our own and now all nations greet  With bending sails each vessel of our fleet  Your pow'r extends as far as winds can blow  Or swelling sails upon the globe may go  Heav'n that hath plac'd this island to give law  To balance Europe and her states to awe  In this conjunction doth on Britain smile  The greatest leader and the greatest isle  Whether this portion of the world were rent  By the rude ocean from the Continent  Or thus created it was sure design'd  To be the sacred refuge of mankind  Hither th' oppressed shall henceforth resort  Justice to crave and succour at your court  And then your Highness not for our's alone  But for the world's Protector shall be known  Fame swister than your winged navy s  ies  Thro' ev'ry land that near the ocean lies  Sounding your name and telling dreadful News  To all that piracy and rapine use  With such a chief the meanest nation blest  Might hope to lift her head above the rest  What may be thought impossible to do  By us embraced by the seas and you  Lords of the world's great waste the ocean we  Whole forests send to reign upon the sea  And ev'ry coast may trouble or relieve  But none can visit us without your leave  Angels and we have this prerogative  That none can at our happy seats arrive  While we descend at pleasure to invade  The bad with vengeance and the good to aid  Our little world the image of the great  Like that amidst the boundless ocean set  Of her own growth hath all that nature craves  And all that's rare as tribute from the waves  As Egypt does not on the clouds rely  But to the Nile owes more than to the sky  So what our Earth and what our heav'n denies  Our everconstant friend the sea supplies  The taste of hot Arabia's spice we know  Free from the scorching sun that makes it grow  Without the worm in Persian silks we shine  And without planting drink of ev'ry vine  To dig for wealth we weary not our limbs  Gold tho' the heaviest Metal hither swims  Our's is the harvest where the Indians mow  We plough the deep and reap what others sow  Things of the noblest kind our own soil breeds  Stout are our men and warlike are our steeds  Rome tho' her eagle thro' the world had flown  Cou'd never make this island all her own  Here the third Edward and the Black Prince too  France conq'ring Henry flourish'd and now you  For whom we staid as did the Grecian state  Till Alexander came to urge their fate  When for more world's the Macedonian cry'd  He wist not Thetys in her lap did hide  Another yet a world reserv'd for you  To make more great than that he did subdue  He safely might old troops to battle lead  Against th' unwarlike Persian and the Mede  Whose hasty flight did from a bloodless field  More spoils than honour to the victor yield  A race unconquer'd by their clime made bold  The Caledonians arm'd with want and cold  Have by a fate indulgent to your fame  Been from all ages kept for you to tame  Whom the old Roman wall so ill confin'd  With a new chain of garrisons you bind  Here foreign gold no more shall make them come  Our English Iron holds them fast at home  They that henceforth must be content to know  No warmer region than their hills of snow  May blame the sun but must extol your grace  Which in our senate hath allow'd them place  Preferr'd by conquest happily o'erthrown  Falling they rise to be with us made one  So kind dictators made when they came home  Their vanquish'd foes free citizens of Rome  Like favour find the Irish with like fate  Advanc'd to be a portion of our state  While by your valour and your bounteous mind  Nations divided by the sea are join'd  Holland to gain your friendship is content  To be our outguard on the continent  She from her fellowprovinces wou'd go  Rather than hazard to have you her foe  In our late fight when cannons did diffuse  Preventing posts the terror and the news  Our neighbour princes trembled at their roar  But our conjunction makes them tremble more  Your neverfailing sword made war to cease  And now you heal us with the acts of peace  Our minds with bounty and with awe engage  Invite affection and restrain our rage  Less pleasure take brave minds in battles won  Than in restoring such as are undone  Tygers have courage and the rugged bear  But man alone can whom he conquers spare  To pardon willing and to punish loath  You strike with one hand but you heal with both  Lifting up al that prostrate lye you grieve  You cannot make the dead again to live  When fate or error had our Age misled  And o'er this nation such confusion spread  The only cure which cou'd from heav'n come down  Was so much pow'r and piety in one  One whose extraction's from an ancient line  Gives hope again that wellborn men may shine  The meanest in your nature mild and good  The noble rest secured in your blood  Oft have we wonder'd how you hid in peace  A mind proportion'd to such things as these  How such a ruling sp'rit you cou'd restrain  And practise first over your self to reign  Your private life did a just pattern give  How fathers husbands pious sons shou'd live  Born to command your princely virtues slept  Like humble David's while the flock he kept  But when your troubled country call'd you forth  Your flaming courage and your matchless worth  Dazling the eyes of all that did pretend  To sierce contention gave a prosp'rous end  Still as you rise the state exalted too  Finds no distemper while 'tis chang'd by you  Chang'd like the world's great scene when without noise  The rising sun night's vulgar lights destroys  Had you some ages past this race of glory  Run with amazement we shou'd read your story  But living virtue all atchievements past  Meets envy still to grapple with at last  This C  sar found and that ungrateful age  With losing him went back to blood and rage  Mistaken Brutus thought to break their yoke  But cut the bond of union with that stroke  That sun once set a thousand meaner stars  Gave a dim light to violence and wars  To such a tempest as now threatens all  Did not your mighty arm prevent the fall  If Rome's great senate cou'd not wield that sword  Which of the conquer'd world had made them lord  What hope had our's while yet their pow'r was new  To rule victorious armies but by you  You that had taught them to subdue their foes  Cou'd order teach and their high sp'rits compose  To ev'ry duty cou'd their minds engage  Provoke their courage and command their rage  So when a lion shakes his dreadful mane  And angry grows if he that first took pain  To tame his youth approach the haughty beast  He bends to him but frights away the rest  As the vext world to find repose at last  Itself into Augustus' arms did cast  So England now doth with like toil opprest  Her weary head upon your bosom rest  Then let the muses with such notes as these  Instruct us what belongs unto our peace  Your battles they hereafter shall indite  And draw the image of our Mars in fight  Tell of towns storm'd of armies overcome  Of mighty kingdoms by your conduct won  How while you thunder'd clouds of dust did choak  Contending troops and seas lay hid in smoke  Illustrious acts high raptures do infuse  And ev'ry conqueror creates a muse  Here in low strains your milder deeds we sing  But there my lord we'll bays and olive bring  To crown your head while you in triumph ride  O'er vanquish'd nations and the sea beside  While all your neighbourprinces unto you  Like Joseph's sheaves pay reverence and bow  JOHN OGILBY  THIS poet who was likewise an eminent Geographer and Cosmographer was born near Edinburgh in the year  Athen Oxon vol ii p  His father who was of an ancient and genteel family having spent his estate and being prisoner in the King's Bench for debt could give his son but little education at school but our author who in his early years discovered the most invincible industry obtained a little knowledge in the Latin grammar and afterwards so much money as not only to procure his father's discharge from prison but also to bind himself apprentice to Mr Draper a dancing master in Holbourn London Soon after by his dexterity in his profession and his complaisant behaviour to his master's employers he obtained the favour of them to lend him as much money as to buy out the remaining part of his time and set up for himself but being afterwards appointed to dance in the duke of Buckingham's great Masque by a false step he strained a vein in the inside of his leg which ever after occasioned him to halt He afterwards taught dancing to the sisters of Sir Ralph Hopton at Wytham in Somersetshire where at leisure he learned to handle the pike and musket When Thomas earl of Strafford became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland he was retained in his family to teach the art of dancing and being  an excellent penman he was frequently employed by the earl to transcribe papers for him  In his lordship's family it was that he first gave proofs of his inclination to poetry by translating some of Aesop's Fables into English verse which he communicated to some learned men who understood Latin better than he by whose assistance and advice he published them He was one of the troop of guards belonging to the earl and composed an humourous piece entitled the Character of a Trooper About the time he was supported by his lordship he was made master of the revels for the kingdom of Ireland and built a little theatre for the representation of dramatic entertainments in St Warburgh's street in Dublin but upon the breaking out of the rebellion in that kingdom he was several times in great danger of his life particularly when he narrowly escaped being blown up in the castle of Rath  a  am About the time of the conclusion of the war in England he left Ireland and being snipwrecked came to London in a very nece  tous condition After he had made a short stay in the metropolis he travelled on foot to Cambridge where his great industry and love of learning recommended him to the notice of several scholars by whose assistance he became so compleat a master of the Latin tongue that in he published an English translation of Virgil which was printed in large vo and dedicated to William marquis of Hereford He reprinted it at London in fol with this title The Works of Publius Virgilius Maro translated and adorned with Sculptures and illustrated with Annotations which Mr Wood tells us was the fairest edition that till then the English press ever produced About the year our indefatigable author learned the Greek language and in four years time published in fol a translation of Homer's Iliad adorned with excellent sculptures illustrated  with Annotations and addressed to King Charles II The same year he published the Bible in a large fol at Cambridge according to the translation fet forth by the special command of King James I with the Liturgy and Articles of the Church of England with Chorographical Sculptures About the year he went into Ireland then having obtained a patent to be made master of the revels there a place which Sir William Davenant sollicited in vain Upon this occasion he built a theatre at Dublin which cost him l the former being ruined during the troubles In he published in London in fol a translation of Homer's Odyssey with Sculptures and Notes He afterwards wrote two heroic poems one entitled the Ephesian Matron the other the Roman Slave both dedicated to Thomas earl of Ossory The next work he composed was an Epic Poem in Books in honour of King Charles I but this was entirely lost in the fire of London in September when Mr Ogilby's house in White Fryars was burnt down and his whole fortune except to the value of five pounds destroyed But misfortunes seldom had any irretrievable consequences to Ogilby for by his insinuating address and most astonishing industry he was soon able to repair whatever loss he sustained by any cross accident It was not lo  till he fell on a method of raising a fresh sum of money Procuring his house to be rebuilt he set up a printingoffice was appointed his Majesty's Cosmographer and Geographic Printer and printed many great works translated and collected by himself and his assistants the enumeration of which would be unnecessary and tedious  This laborious man died September and was interred in the vault under part of the church in St Bride's in Fleetstreet Mr Edward Philips in  his Theatrum Poetarum stiles him one of the prodigies from producing after so late an initiation into literature so many large and learned volumes as well in verse as in prose and tells us that his Paraphrase upon Aesop's Fables is generally confessed to have exceeded whatever hath been done before in that kind  As to our author's poetry we have the authority of Mr Pope to pronounce it below criticism at least his translations and in all probability his original epic poems which we have never seen are not much superior to his translations of Homer and Virgil If Ogilby had not a poetical genius he was notwithstanding a man of parts and made an amazing proficiency in literature by the force of an unwearied application He cannot be sufficiently commended for his virtuous industry as well as his filial piety in procuring in so early a time of life his father's liberty when he was confined in a prison  Ogilby seems indeed to have been a good sort of man and to have recommended himself to the world by honest means without having recourse to the servile arts of flattery and the blandishments of falshood He is an instance of the astonishing efficacy of application had some more modern poets been blessed with a thousandth part of his oeconomy and industry they needed not to have lived in poverty and died or want Although Ogilby cannot be denomi  ated a genius yet he found means to make a genteel livelihood by literature which many of the sons of Parnassus blessed with superior powers curse as a very dry and unpleasing soil but which proceeds more from want of culture than native barrenness  WILMOT Earl of ROCHESTER  IT is an observation founded on experience that the poets have of all other men been most addicted to the gratifications of appetite and have pursued pleasure with more unwearied application than men of other characters In this respect they are indeed unhappy and have ever been more subject to pity than envy A violent love of pleasure if it does not destroy yet in a great measure enervates all other good qualities with which a man may be endowed and as no men have ever enjoyed higher parts from nature than the poets so few from this unhappy attachment to pleasure have effected so little good by those amazing powers Of the truth of this observation the nobleman whose memoirs we are now to present to the reader is a strong and indelible instance for few ever had more ability and more frequent opportunities for promoting the interests of society and none ever prostituted the gifts of Heaven to a more inglorious purpose Lord Rochester was not more remarkable for the superiority of his parts than the extraordinary debauchery of his life and with his dissipations of pleasure he suffered sometimes malevolent principles to govern him and was equally odious for malice and envy as for the boundless gratifications of his appetites  This is no doubt the character of his lordship confirmed by all who have transmitted any  account of him but if his life was supremely wicked his death was exemplarily pious before he approached to the conclusion of his days he saw the follies of his former pleasures he liv  d to repent with the severest con  ition and charity obliges all men to believe that he was as sincere in his protestations of penitence as he had been before in libertine indulgence The apparent forrow he felt arising from the stings and compunctions of conscience entitle him to the  eader's compassion and has determined us to represent his errors with all imagi  able tenderness which as it is agreeable to every benevolent man so his lordship has a right to this indulgence since he obliterated his faults by his penitence and became so conspicuous an evidence on the side of virtue by his important declarations against the charms of vice  Lord Rochester was son of the gallant Henry lord Wilmot who engaged with great zeal in the service of King Charles I during the civil wars and was so much in favour with Charles II that he entrusted his person to him after the unfortunate battle of Worcester which trust he discharged with so much fidelity and address that the young King was conveyed out of England into France chiefly by his care application and vigilance The mother of our author was of the ancient family of the St Johns in Wiltshire and has been celebrated both for her beauty and parts  In the year distinguished to posterity by the fall of Charles I who suffered on a scaffold erected before the window of his own palace our author was born at Dichley near Woodstock in the same county the scene of many of his pleasures and of his death His lordship's father had the misfortune to reap none of the rewards of suffering loyalty for he died in immediately before the restoration leaving his son as the  principal part of his inheritance his titles honours and the merit of those extraordinary services he had done the crown but though lord Wilmot left his son but a small estate yet he did not suffer in his education by these means for the oeconomy of his mother supplied that desiciency and he was educated suitable to his quality When he was at school it is agreed by all his biographers he gave early instances of a readiness of wit and those shining parts which have since appeared with so much lustre began then to shew themselves he acquired the Latin to such perfection that to his dying day he retained a great relish for the masculine firmness as well as more elegant beauties of that language and was says Dr Burnet  'exactly versed in those authors who were the ornaments of the court of Augustus which he read often with the peculiar delight which the greatest wits have often found in those studies'  When he went to the university the general joy which overran the nation upon his Majesty's return amounted to something like distraction and soon spread a very malignant influence through all ranks of life His lordship tasted the pleasures of libertinism which then broke out in a full tide with too acute a relish and was almost overwhelmed in the abyss of wantonness His tutor was Dr Elandford afterwards promoted to the sees of Oxford and Worcester and under his inspection he was committed to the more immediate care of Phinehas Berry fellow of Wadham College a man of learning and probity whom his lordship afterwards treated with much respect and rewarded as became a great man but notwithstanding the care of his tutor he had so deeply engaged in the dissipations of the general jubilee that he could not be prevailed upon to renew his studies which were totally lost in  the joys more agreeable to his inclination He never thought of resuming again the pursuit of knowledge 'till the fine address of his go vernor Dr Balfour won him in his travels by degrees to those charms of study which he had through youthful levity forsaken and being seconded by reason now more strong and a more mature taste of the pleasure of learning which the Dr took care to place in the most agreeable and advantageous light he became enamoured of knowledge in the pursuit of which he often spent those hours he sometimes stole from the witty and the fair He returned from his travels in the th year of his age and appeared at court with as great advantage as any young nobleman ever did He had a graceful and well proportio  e  person was  aster of the most refined breeding and po  ed a very obliging and easy manner He ha  a vast viva  ity of thought and  ex  ression and all who conversed with him entertained the hig  est opinion of his understanding and 'tis inde  d no wonder he was so m  h  essed at a court which abounded with men of wit countenanced by a merry prince who reli  d nothing so much as brilliant conversation  Soon after his lordship's return from his travels he  the fir  occa  on that offered to hazard his  in the service of his country  In the winter of the year he went to sea with the earl of Sandwich when he was sent out against the Dutch East India fleet and was in the ship called the Revenge commanded by Sir Thomas Tiddiman when the attack was made on the port of Bergen in Norway the Dutch Ships having got into that port It was says Burnet  'as desperate an attempt as ever was made and during the whole action the earl of Rochester shewed as brave and resolute a courage as possible A person of honour told me he heard the  lord Clifford who was in the same ship often magnify his courage at that time very highly nor did the rigour of the season the hardness of the voyage and the extreme danger he had been in deter him from running the like the very next occasion for the summer following he went to sea again without communicating his design to his nearest relations He went aboard the ship commanded by Sir Edward Spragge the day before the great seafight of that year almost all the volunteers that went in that ship were killed During the action Sir Edward Spragge not being satisfied with the behaviour of one of the captains could not easily find a person that would undertake to venture through so much danger to carry his command to the captain this lord offered himself to the service and went in a little boat through all the shot and delivered his message and returned back to Sir Edward which was much commended by all that saw it'  These are the early instances of courage which can be produced in favour of lord Rochester which was afterwards impeached and very justly for in many private broils he discovered a timid pusillanimous spirit very unsuitable to those noble instances of the contrary which have just been mentioned  The author of his life prefixed to his works which goes under the name of M St Evremond addressed to the Duchess of Mazarine but which M Maizeau asserts not to be his accounts for it upon the general observation of that disparity between a man and himself upon different occasions Let it suffice says he  'to observe that we differ not from one another more than we do from ourselves at different times'  But we imagine another and a stronger reason may be given for the cowardice which Rochester afterwards  discovered in private broils particularly in the affair between him and the earl of Mulgrave in which he behaved very meanly  See the Life of Sheffield Duke of Buckingham  The coura  e which lord Rochester shewed in a naval engagement was in the early part of his life before he had been immersed in those labyrinths of excess and luxury into which he afterwards sunk It is certainly a true observation that guilt makes cowards a man who is continually subjected to the reproaches of conscience who is afraid to examine his heart left it should appear too horrible cannot have much courage for while he is conscious of so many errors to be repented of of so many vices he has committed he naturally starts at danger and slies from it as his greatest enemy It is true courage is sometimes constitutional and there have been instances of men guilty of every en  rmity who have discovered a large share of it but these have been wrerches who have overcome all sense of honour been lost to every consideration of virtue and whose courage is like that of the lion of the desart a kind of ferocious impulse unconnected with reason Lord Rochester had certainly never overcome the reproaches of his conscience whose alarming voice at last struck terror into his heart and chilled the fire of the spirits  Since his travels and naval expeditions he seemed to have contracted a habit of temperance in which had he been so happy as to persevere he must have escaped that fatal r  ck on which he afterwards split upon his return to court where love and pleasure kept their perpetual rounds under the smiles of a prince whom nature had fitted for all the enjoyments of the most luxurious desires In times so dissolute as these it is no wonder if a man of so warm a constitution as Rochester could not resist the  too flattering temptations which were heightened by the participation of the court in general The uncommon charms of Rochester's conversation induced all men to court him as a companion tho' they often paid too dear for their curiosity by being made the subject of his lampoons if they happened to have any oddities in their temper by the exposing of which he could humour his propensity to scandal His pleasant extravagancies soon became the subject of general conversation by which his vanity was at once flattered and his turn of satire rendered more keen by the success it met with  Rochester had certainly a true talent for satire and he spared neither friends nor foes but let it loose on all without discrimination Majesty itself was not secure from it he more than once lampooned the King whose weakness and attachment to some of his mistresses he endeavoured to cure by several means that is either by winning them from him in spite of the indulgence and liberality they felt from a royal gallant or by severely lampooning them and him on various occasions which the King who was a man of wit and pleasure as well as his lordship took for the natural sallies of his genius and meant rather as the amusements of his fancy than as the efforts of malice yet either by a too frequent repetition or a too close and poignant virulence the King banished him the court for a satire made directly on him this satire consists of stanzas and is entitled The Restoration or the History of the Insipids and as it contains the keenest reslexions against the political conduct and private character of that Prince and having produced the ba  shment of this noble lord we shall here give it a place by which his lordship's genius for this kind of writing will appear  The RESTORATION or The

farewel sacred Majesty  Let's pull all brutish tyrants down  Where men are born and still live free  There ev'ry head doth wear a crown  Mankind like miserable frogs  Prove wretched king'd by storks and dogs  Much about this time the duke of Buckingham was under disgrace for things of another nature and being disengaged from any particular attachment in town he and lord Rochester resolved like Don Quixote of old to set out in quest of adventures and they met with some that will appear entertaining to our readers which we shall give upon the authority of the author of Rochester's Life prefixed to his works Among many other adventures the following was one  There happened to be an inn on Newmarket road to be lett they disguised themselves in proper habits for the persons they were to assume and jointly took this inn in which each in his turn officiated as master but they soon made this subservient to purposes of another nature  Having carefully observed the pretty girls in the country with whom they were most captivated they considered not whether maids wives or widows and to gain opportunities of seducing them they invited the neighbours who had either wives or daughters to frequent feasts where the men were plied hard with good liquor and the women sufficiently warmed to make but as little resistance as would be agreeable to their inclinations dealing out their poison to both sexes inspiring the men with wine and other  strong liquors and the women with love thus they were able to deflower many a virgin and alienate the affections of many a wife by this odd stratagem and it is difficult to say whether it is possible for two men to live to a worse purpose  It is natural to imagine that this kind of life could not be of long duration Feasts so frequently given and that without any thing to pay must give a strong suspicion that the innkeepers must soon break or that they were of such fortune and circumstances as did not well suit the post they were inThis their lordships were sensible of but not much concerned about it since they were seldom found long to continue in the same sort of adventures variety being the life of their enjoyments It was besides near the time of his Majesty's going to Newmarket when they designed that the discovery of their real plots should clear them of the imputation of being concerned in any more pernicious to the government These two conjectures meeting they thought themselves obliged to dispatch two important adventures which they had not yet been able to compassThere was an old cove  ous miser in the neighbourhood who notwithstanding his age was in possession of a very agreeable young wife Her husband watched her with the same assiduity he did his money and never trusted her out of his sight but under the protection of an old maiden sister who never had herself experienced the joys of love and bore no great benevolence to all who were young and handsome Our noble innkeepers had no manner of doubt of his accepting a treat as many had done for he loved good living with all his heart when it cost him nothing and except upon these occasions he was the most temperate and abstemious man alive but then they could never prevail with him to bring his wife notnotwithstandlng  they urged the presence of so many good wives in the neighbourhood to keep her company All their study was then how to deceive the old sister at home who was set as a guardian over that fruit which the miser could neither eat himself nor suffer any other to taste but such a difficulty as this was soon to be overcome by such inventions It was therefore agreed that lord Rochester should be dressed in woman's cloaths and while the husband was feasting with my lord duke he should make trial of his skill with the old woman at home He had learned that she had no aversion to the bottle when she could come secretly and conveniently at it Equipped like a country lass and furnished with a bottle of spiritous liquors he marched to the old miser's house It was with difficulty he found means to speak with the old woman but at last obtained the favour where perfect in all the cant of those people he began to tell the occasion of his coming in hopes she would invite him to come in but all in vain he was admitted no further that the porch with the house door ajar At last my lord finding no other way fell upon this expedient He pretended to be taken suddenly ill and tumbled down upon the threshold This noise brings the young wife to them who with much trouble persuades her keeper to help her into the house in regard to the decorum of her sex and the unhappy condition she was in The door had not been long shut till our impostor by degrees recovers and being set on a chair cants a very religious thanksgiving to the good gentlewoman for her kindness and observed how deplorable it was to be subject to such fits which often took her in the street and exposed her to many accidents but every now and then took a sip of the bottle and recommended it to the old benefactress who was sure  to drink a hearty dram His lordship had another bottle in his pocket qualified with a Opium which would sooner accomplish his desire by giving the woman a somniferous dose which drinking with greediness she soon fell fast asleep  His lordship having so far succeeded and being fired with the presence of the young wife for whom he had formed this odd scheme his desires became impetuous which produced a change of colour and made the artless creature imagine the fit was returning My lord then asked if she would be so charitable as to let him lie down on the bed the goodnatured young woman shewed him the way and being laid down and staying by him at his request he put her in mind of her condition asking about her husband whom the young woman painted in his true colours as a surly jealous old tyrant The rural innocent imagining she had only a woman with her was less reserved in her behaviour and expressions on that account and his lordship soon found that a tale of love would not be unpleasing to her Being now no longer able to curb his appetite which was wound up beyond the power of restraint he declared his sex to her and without much struggling enjoyed her  He now became as happy as indulgence could make him and when the first transports were over he contrived the escape of this young adultress from the prison of her keeper She hearkened to his proposals with pleasure and before the old gentlewoman was awake she robbed her husband of an hundred and fifty pieces and marched off with lord Rochester to the inn about midnight  They were to pass over three or four fields before they could reach it and in going over the last they very nearly escaped falling into the enemy's  hands but the voice of the husband discovering who he was our adventurers struck down the field out of the path and sor the greater security lay down in the grass The place the occasion and the person that was so near put his lordship in mind of renewing his pleasure almost in sight of the cuckold The fair was no longer coy and easily yielded to his desires He in short carried the girl home and then prostituted her to the duke's pleasure after he had been cloyed himself The old man going home and finding his sister asleep his wife fled and his m  ney gone was thrown into a state of madness and soon hanged himself The news was soon spread about the neighbourhood and reached the inn where both lovers now as weary of their purchase as desirous of it before advised her to go to London with which she complied and in all probability followed there the trade of prostitution for a subsistance  The King soon after this infamous adventure coming that way found them both in their posts at the inn took them again into favour and suffered them to go with him to Newmarket This exploit of lord Rochester is not at all improbable when his character is considered His treachery in the affair of the miser's wife is very like him and surely it was one of the greatest acts of baseness of which he was ever guilty he artfully seduced her while her unsuspecting husband was entertained by the duke of Buckingham he contrived a robbery and produced the death of the injured husband this complicated crime was one of those heavy charges on his mind when he lay on his deathbed under the dreadful alarms of his conscience  His lordship's amours at court made a great noise in the world of gallantry especially that which he had with the celebrated Mrs Roberts mistress  to the King whom she abondoned for the possession of Rochester's heart which she found to her experience it was not in her power long to hold The earl who was soon cloyed with the possession of any one woman tho' the fairest in the world forsook her The lady after the first indignation of her passion subsided grew as indifferent and considered upon the proper means of retrieving the King's affections The occasion was luckily given her one morning while she was dresling she saw the King coming by she hurried down with her hair disheveled threw herself at his feet implored his pardon and vowed constancy for the future The King overcome with the welldissembled agonies of this beauty raised her up took her in his arms and protested no man could see her and not love her he waited on her to her lodging and there compleated the reconciliation This easy behaviour of the King had with many other instances of the same kind determined my lord Hallifax to assert  "That the love of King Charles II lay as much as any man's in the lower regions that he was indifferent as to their constancy and only valued them for the sensual pleasure they could yield"  Lord Rochester's frolics in the character of a mountebank are well known and the speech which he made upon the occasion of his first turning itinerant doctor has been often printed there is in it a true spirit of satire and a keenness of lampoon which is very much in the character of his lordship who had certainly an original turn for invective and satirical composition  We shall give the following short extract from this celebrated speech in which his lordship's wit appears pretty conspicuous  "If I appear says Alexander Bendo to any one like a counterfeit even for the sake of that chiefly ought I to be construed a true man who is the counterfeit's example his original and that which he employs his industry and pains to imitate and copy Is it therefore my fault if the cheat by his wit and endeavours makes himself so like me that consequently I cannot avoid resembling him Consider pray the valiant and the coward the wealthy merchant and the bankrupt the politician and the fool they are the same in many things and differ but in one alone The valiant man holds up his hand looks confidently round about him wears a sword courts a lord's wife and owns it so does the coward One only point of honour and that's courage which like false metal one only trial can discover makes the distinction The bankrupt walks the exchange buys bargains draws bills and accepts them with the richest whilst paper and credit are current coin that which makes the difference is real cash a great defect indeed and yet but one and that the last found out and still till then the least perceivedNow for the politician he is a grave diliberating close prying man Pray are there not grave deliberating close prying fools If therefore the difference betwixt all these tho' infinite in effect be so nice in all appearance will you yet expect it should be otherwise between the false physician astrologer c and the true The first calls himself learned doctor sends forth his bills gives physic and council tells and foretells the other is bound to do just as much It is only your experience must distinguish betwixt them to which I willingly submit myself"  When lord Rochester was restored again to the favour of King Charles II he continued the same extravagant pursuits of pleasure and would even use freedoms with that Prince whom he had before so much offended for his satire knew no bounds his invention was lively and his execution sharp  He is supposed to have contrived with one of Charles's mistres's the following stratagem to cure that monarch of the nocturnal rambles to which he addicted himself He agreed to go out one night with him to visit a celebrated house of intrigue where he told his Majesty the finest women in England were to be found The King made no scruple to assume his usual disguise and accompany him and while he was engaged with one of the ladies of pleasure being before instructed by Rochester how to behave she pick'd his pocket of all his money and watch which the king did not immediately miss Neither the people of the house nor the girl herself was made acquainted with the quality of their visiter nor had the least suspicion who he was When the intrigue was ended the King enquired for Rochester but was told he had quitted the house without taking leave But into what embarassment was he thrown when upon searching his pockets in order to discharge the reckoning he found his money gone he was then reduced to ask the favour of the Jezebel to give him credit till to morrow as the gentleman who came in with him had not returned who was to have pay'd for both The consequence of this request was he was abused and laughed at and the old woman told him that she had often been served such dirty tricks and would not permit him to stir till the reckoning was paid and then called one of her bullies to take care of him In this  ridiculous distress stood the British monarch the prisoner of a bawd and the life upon whom the nation's hopes were fixed put in the power of a ruffian After many altercations the King at last proposed that she should accept a ring which he then took off his finger in pledge for her money which she likewise refused and told him that as she was no judge of the value of the ring she did not chuse to accept such pledges The King then desired that a Jeweller might be called to give his opinion of the value of it but he was answered that the expedient was impracticable as no jeweller could then be supposed to be out of bed After much entreaty his Majesty at last prevailed upon the sellow to knock up a jeweller and shew him the ring which as soon as he had inspected he stood amazed and enquired with eyes fixed upon the fellow who he had got in his house to which he answered a blacklooking ugly son of a w who had no money in his pocket and was obliged to pawn his ring The ring says the jewcller is so immensely rich that but one man in the nation could afford to wear it and that one is the King The jeweller being astonished at this accident went out with the bully in order to be fully satisfied of so extraordinary an affair and as soon as he entered the room he sell on his knees and with the utmost respect presented the ring to his Majesty The old Jezebel and the bully sinding the extraordinary quality of their guest were now confounded and asked pardon most submissively on their knees The King in the best natured manner forgave than and laughing asked them whether the ring would not bear another bottle  Thus ended this adventure in which the  learned how dangerous it was to risk  person in nightf  olics and could not  but severely reprove Rochester for acting such a part towards him however he sincerely refolved never again to be guilty of the like indiscretion  These are the most material of the adventures and libertine courses of the lord Rochester which historians and biographers have transmitted to posterity we shall now consider him as an author  He seems to have been too strongly tinctured with that vice which belongs more to literary people than to any other profession under the sun viz envy That lord Rochester was envious and jealous of the reputation of other men of eminence appears abundantly clear from his behaviour to Dryden which could proceed from no other principle as his malice towards him had never discovered itself till the tragedies of that great poet met with such general applause and his poems were universally esteemed Such was the inveteracy he shewed to Mr Dryden that he set up John Crown an obscure man in opposition to him and recommended him to the King to compose a masque for the court which was really the business of the poet laureat but when Crown's Conquest of Jerusalem met with as extravagant success as Dryden's Almanzor's his lordship then withdrew his favour from Crown as if he would be still in contradiction to the public His malice to Dryden is said to have still further discovered itself in hiring ruffians to cudgel him for a satire he was supposed to be the author of which was at once malicious cowardly and cruel But of this we shall give a fuller account in the life of Mr Dryden  Mr Wolsely in his preface to Valentinian a tragedy altered by lord Rochester from Fletcher has given a character of his lordship and his writings by no means consistent with that idea  which other writers and common tradition dispose us to form of him  'He was a wonderful man says he whether we consider the constant good sense and agreeable mirth of his ordinary conversation or the vast reach and compass of his inventions and the amazing depth of his retired thoughts the uncommon graces of his fashion or the inimitable turns of his wit the becoming gentleness the bewitching softness of his civility or the force and fitness of his satire for as he was both the delight the love and the dotage of the women so was he a continued curb to impertinence and the public censure of folly never did man stay in his company unentertained or leave it uninstructed never was his understanding biassed or his pleasantness forced never did he laugh in the wrong place or prostitute his sense to serve his luxury never did he stab into the wounds of fallen virtue with a base and a cowardly insult or smooth the face of prosperous villany with the paint and washes of a mercenary wit never did he spare a fop for being rich or flatter a knave for being great He had a wit that was accompanied with an unaffected greatness of mind and a natural love to justice and truth a wit that was in perpetual war with knavery and ever attacking those kind of vices most whose malignity was like to be the most diffusive such as tended more immediately to the prejudice of public bodies and were a common nusance to the happiness of human kind Never was his pen drawn but on the side of good sense and usually employed like the arms of the ancient heroes to stop the progress of arbitrary oppression and beat down the brutishness of headstrong  will to do his King and country justice upon such public state thieves as would beggar a kingdom to enrich themselves these were the vermin whom to his eternal honour his pen was continually pricking and goading a pen if not so happy in the success yet as generous in the aim as either the sword of Theseus or the club of Hercules nor was it less sharp than that or less weighty than this If he did not take so much care of himself as he ought he had the humanity however to wish well to others and I think I may truly affirm he did the world as much good by a right application of satire as he hurt himself by a wrong pursuit of pleasure'  In this amiable light has Mr Wolsely drawn our author and nothing is more certain than that it is a portraiture of the imagination warmed with gratitude or friendship and bears but little or no resemblance to that of Rochester can he whose satire is always levelled at particular persons be said to be the terror of knaves and the public soe of vice when he himself has acknowledged that he satirized only to gratify his resentment for it was his opinion that writing satires without being in a rage was like killing in cold blood Was his conversation instructive whose mouth was full of obscenity and was he a friend to his country who diffused a dangerous venom thro' his works to corrupt its members in which it is to be feared he has been but too successful Did he never smooth the face of prosperous villainy as Mr Wolsely expresses it the scope of whose life was to promote and encourage the most licentious debauchery and to unhinge all the principles of honourEither Mr Wolsely must be strangely mistaken or all other writers who have given us  accounts of Rochester must be so and as his single assertions are not equal to the united authorities of so many we may reasonably reject his testimony as a deviation from truth  We have now seen these scenes of my lord Rochester's life in which he appears to little advantage it is with infinite pleasure we can take a view of the brighter side of his character to do which we must attend him to his deathbed Had he been the amiable man Mr Wolsely represents him he needed  ot have suffered so many pangs of remorse nor felt the horrors of conscience nor been driven almost to despair by his reflexions on a mispent life  Rochester lived a profligate but he died a penitent He lived in defiance of all principles but when he felt the cold hand of death upon him he reflected on his folly and saw that the portion of iniquity is at last sure to be only pain and anguish  Dr Burnet the excellent bishop of Sarum however he may be reviled by a party with many other obligations conferred upon the world has added some account of lord Rochester in his dying moments No state policy in this case can well be supposed to have biassed him and when there are no motives to falsehood it is somewhat cruel to discredit assertions The Dr could not be influenced by views of interest to give this or any other account of his lordship and could certainly have no other incentive but that of serving his country by shewing the instability of vice and by drawing into light an illustrious penitent adding one wreath more to the banners of virtue  Burnet begins with telling us that an accident fell out in the early part of the Earl's life which in its consequences confirmed him in the pursuit of vicious courses  "When he went to sea in the year there happened to be in the same ship with him Mr Montague and another gentleman of quality these two the former especially seemed persuaded that they should never return into England Mr Montague said he was sure of it the other was not so positive The earl of Rochester and the last of these entered into a formal engagement not without ceremonies of religion that if either of them died he should appear and give the other notice of the future state if there was any But Mr Montague would not enter into the bond When the Day came that they thought to have taken the Dutch fleet in the port of Bergen Mr Montague tho' he had such a strong presage in his mind of his approaching death yet he bravely stayed all the while in the place of the greatest danger The other gentleman signalized his courage in the most undaunted manner till near the end of the action when he fell on a sudden into such a trembling that he could scarce stand and Mr Montague going to him to hold him up as they were in each others arms a cannon ball carried away Mr Montague's belly so that he expired in an hour after"  The earl of Rochester told Dr Burnet that these presages they had in their minds made some impression on him that there were separate beings and that the soul either by a natural sagacity or some secret notice communicated to it had a sort of divination But this gentleman's never appearing was a snare to him during the rest of his life Though when he mentioned this he could not but acknowledge it was an unreasonable thing for him to think that beings in another state were not under such laws and limits that they could not command their motion but as the supreme power should order them and that one who had so corrapted  the natural principles of truth as he had had no reason to expect that miracles should be wrought for his conviction  He told Dr Burnet another odd presage of approaching death in lady Ware his motherinlaw's family The chaplain had dreamed that such a day he should die but being by all the family laughed out of the belief of it he had almost forgot it till the evening before at supper there being thirteen at table according to an old conceit that one of the family must soon die one of the young ladies pointed to him that he was the person Upon this the chaplain recalling to mind his dream fell into some disorder and the lady Ware reprowing him for his superstition he said he was co  dent he was to die before morning but he being on perfect health it was not much minded It was saturday night and he was to preach next day He went to his chamber and set up late as it appeared by the burning of his candle and he had been preparing his notes for his sermon but was found dead in his bed next morning  These things his lordship said made him incline to believe that the soul was of a substance distinct from matter but that which convinced him of it was that in his last sickness which brought him so near his death when his spirits were so spent he could not move or stir and did not hope to live an hour he said his reason and judgment were so clear and strong that from thence he was fully persuaded that death was not the dissolution of the soul but only the separation of it from matter He had in that sickness great remorse for his past life but he afterwards said they were rather general and dark horrors than any conviction of transgression against his maker he was sorry he had lived so as to waste his strength so soon or that he had brought such an ill name upon himself and had an agony in his  mind about it which he knew not well how to express but believed that these impunctions of conscience rather proceeded from the horror of his condition than any true contrition for the errors of his life"  During the time Dr Burnet was at lord Rochester's house they entered frequently into conversation upon the topics of natural and reveal'd religion which the Dr endeavoured to enlarge upon and explain in a manner suitable to the condition of a dying penitent his lordship expressed much contrition for his having so often violated the laws of the one against his better knowledge and having spurned the authority of the other in the pride of wanton sophistry He declared that he was satisfied of the truth of the christian religion that he thought it the institution of heaven and afforded the most natural idea of the supreme being as well as the most forcible motives to virtue of any faith professed amongst men  'He was not only satisfied says Dr Burnet of the truth of our holy religion merely as a matter of speculation but was persuaded likewise of the power of inward grace of which he gave me this strange account He said Mr Parsons in order to his conviction read to him the  d  chapter of the prophesies of Isaiah and compared that with the history of our Saviour's passion that he might there see a prophesy concerning it written many ages before it was done which the Jews that blasphemed Jesus Christ still kept in their hands as a book divinely inspired He said as he heard it read he felt an inward force upon him which did so enlighten his mind and convince him that he could resist it no longer for the words had an authority which did shoot like rays or beams in his mind so that he was not only convinced by the reasonings he had  about it which satisfied his understanding but by a power which did so effectually constrain him that he ever after firmly believed in his Saviour as if he had seen him in the clouds'  We are not quite certain whether there is not a tincture of enthusiasm in this account given by his lordship as it is too natural to fly from one extreme to another from the excesses of debauchery to the gloom of methodism but even if we suppose this to have been the case he was certainly in the safest extreme and there is more comfort in hearing that a man whose life had been so remarkably prossigate as his should die under such impressions than quit the world without one pang for past ossences  The bishop gives an instance of the grea alteration of his lordship's temper and dispositions from what they were formerly in his sickness  'Whenever he happened to be out of order either by pain or sickness his temper became quite ungovernable and his passions so sierce that his servants were afraid to approach him But in this last sickness he was all humility patience and resignation Once he was a little offended with the delay of a servant who he thought made not baste enough with somewhat he called for and said in a little heat that damn'd fellow'  Soon after says the Dr I told him that I was glad to find his stile so reformed and that he had so entirely overcome that ill habit of swearing only that word of calling any damned which had returned upon him was not decent his answer was  'O that language of fiends which was so familiar to me hangs yet about me sure none has deserved more to be damned than I have done and after he had hambly asked God pardon for it he desired me to call the person to him  that he might ask him forgiveness but I told him that was needless for he had said it of one who did not hear it and so could not be ossended by it In this disposition of mind continues the bishop all the while I was with him four days together he was then brought so low that all hope of recovery was gone Much purulent matter came from him with his urine which he passed always with pain but one day with inexpressible torment yet he bore it decently without breaking out into repinings or impatient complaints Nature being at last quite exhausted and all the floods of life gone he died without a groan on the th of July in the d year of his age A day or two before his death he lay much silent and seemed extremely devont in his contemplations he was frequently observed to raise his eyes to heaven and send forth ejaculations to the searcher of hearts who saw his penitence and who he hoped would forgive him'  Thus died lord Rochester an amazing instance of the goodness of God who permitted him to enjoy time and inclined his heart to penitence As by his life he was suffered to set an example of the most abandoned dissoluteness to the world so by his death he was a lively demonstration of the fruitlessness of vicious courses and may be proposed as an example to all those who are captivated with the charms of guilty pleasure  Let all his failings now sleep with him in the grave and let us only think of his closing moments his penitence and reformation Had he been permitted to have recovered his illness it is reasonable to presume he would have been as lively an example of virtue as he had ever been of vice and have born his testimony in savour of religion  He left behind him a son named Charles who dying on the th of November was buried by his father on the th of December following he also left behind him three daughters The male line ceasing Charles II conferred the title of earl of Rochester on Lawrence viscount Killingworth a younger son of Edward earl of Clarendon  We might now enumerate his lordship's writings of which we have already given some character but unhappily for the world they are too generally diffused and we think ourselves under no obligations to particularize those works which have been so fruitful of mischief to society by promoting a general corruption of morals and which he himself in his last moments wished he could recal or rather that he never had composed  GEORGE VILLIERS Duke of BUCKINGHAM  SON and heir of George duke marquis and earl of Buckingham murdered by Felton in the year This nobleman was born at WallingfordHouse in the parish of St Martin's in the Fields on the th of January and baptized there on the th of February following by Dr Laud then bishop of Bath and Wells afterwards archbishop of Canterbury  Before we proceed to give any particulars of our noble author's life we must entreat the reader's indulgence to take a short view of the life of his grace's father in which some circumstances extremely curious will appear and we are the more embold  ned to venture upon this freedom as some who have written this life before us have taken the same liberty by which the reader is no loser for the first duke of Buckingham was a man whose prosperity was so instantaneous his honours so great his life so dissipated and his death so remarkable that as no minister ever enjoyed so much power so no man ever drew the attention of the world more upon him No sooner had he returned from his travels and made his first appearance at court than he became a favourite with King James who says Clarendon  'of all wise men he ever knew was most delighted and taken with handsome persons and fine cloaths'  He had begun to be weary of his favourite the earl of Somerset who was the only one who kept that post so long without any public reproach from the people till at last he was convicted of the horrid conspiracy against the life of Sir Thomas Overbary and condemned as a murderer While these things were in agitation Villiers appeared at court he was according to all accounts the gayest and handsomest man in his time of an open generous temper of an unreserved affability and the most engaging politeness  In a few days he was made cupbearer to the King by which he was of course to be much in his presence and so admitted to that conversation with which that prince always abounded at his meals He had not acted five weeks on this stage to use the noble historian's expression till he mounted higher being knighted and made gentleman of the bedchamber and knight of the most noble order of the garter and in a snort time a baron a viscount an earl a marquis and lord highadmiral of England lord warden of the ci  que ports master of the horse and entirely disposed all the favours of the King acting as absolutely in conferring honours and distinctions as if he himself had wore the diadem  We find him soon after making war or peace according to humour resentment or favour He carried the prince of Wales into Spain to see the Infanta who was proposed to him as a wife and it plainly enough appears that he was privy to one intrigue of prince Charles and which was perhaps the only one which that prince whom all historians whether friends or enemies to his cause have agreed to celebrate  or chas  ty and the temperate virtues There is an original letter of prince Charles to the duke which was published by Mr Thomas Hearne and is said once to have belonged  to archbishop Sancroft As it is a sort of curiosity we shall here insert it  "STENNY  "I have nothing now to write to you but to give you thankes both for the good councell ye gave me and for the event of it The King gave mee a good sharpe potion but you took away the working of it by the well relished comfites ye sent after it I have met with the partie that must not be named once alreddie and the culler of wryting this letter shall make mee meet with her on saturday although it is written the day being thursday So assuring you that the bus'ness goes safely onn I rest"  "Your constant friend CHARLES  "I hope you will not shew the King this letter but put it in the safe custody of mister Vulcan"  It was the good fortune of this nobleman to have an equal interest with the son as with the father and when prince Charles ascended the throne his power was equally extensive and as before gave such offence to the House of Commons and the people that he was voted an enemy to the realm and his Majesty was frequently addressed to remove him from his councils Tho' Charles I had certainly more virtues and was of a more military turn than his father yet in the circumstance of doating upon favourites he was equally weak His misfortune was that he never sufficiently trusted his own judgment which was often better than that of  his servants and from this diffidence he was tenacious of a minister of whose abilities he had a high opinion and in whose fidelity he put confidence  The duke at last became so obnoxious that it entered into the head of an enthusiast tho' otherwise an honest man one lieutenant Felton that to assassinate this court favourite this enemy of the realm would be doing a grateful thing to his country by ridding it of one whose measures in his opinion were likely soon to destroy it  The fate of the duke was now approaching and it is by far the most interesting circumstance in his life  We shall insert in the words of the noble historian the particular account of it  'John Felton an obscure man in his own person who had been bred a soldier and lately a lieutenant of foot whose captain had been killed on the retreat at the Isle of Ree upon which he conceived that the company of right ought to have been conferred upon him and it being refused him by the duke of Buckingham general of the army had given up his commission and withdrawn himself from the army He was of a melancholic nature and had little conversation with any body yet of a gentleman's family in Suffolk of a good fortune and reputation From the time that he had quitted the army he resided at London when the House of Commons transported with passion and prejudice against the duke had accused him to the House of Peers for several misdemeanors and miscarriages and in some declarations had stiled him the cause of all the evils the kingdom suffered and an enemy to the public'  'Some transcripts of such expressions and some  general invectives he met with amongst the people to whom this great man was not grateful wrought so far upon this melancholic gentleman that he began to believe he should do God good service if he killed the duke He chose no other instrument to do it than an ordinary knife which he bought of a common catler for a shilling and thus provided he repaired to Portsmouth where he arrived the eve of St Bartholomew The duke was then there in order to prepare and make ready the fleet and the army with which he resolved in a few days to transport himself to the relief of Rochelle w  ich was then besieged by cardinal Richelieu and for the relief whereof the duke was the more obliged by reason that at his being at the Isle of Ree he had received great supplies of victnals and some companies of their garrison from the town the want of both which they were at this time very sensible of and grieved at'  'This morning of St Bartholomew the duke had received letters in which he was advertised that Rochelle had relieved itself upon which he directed that his breakfast might be speedily made ready and he would make haste to acquaint the King with the good news the court being then at Southwick about five miles from Portsmouth The chamber in which he was dressing himself was full of company and of officers in the fleet and army There was Monsieur de Soubize brother to the duke de Rohan and other French gentlemen who were very sollicitous for the embarkation of the army and for the departure of the fleet for the relief of Rochelle and they were at that time in much trouble and and perplexity out of apprehension that the news the duke had received that morning might slacken the preparations of the voyage which their impatience and interest persuaded  them was not advanced with expedition and so they held much discourse with the duke of the impossibility that his intelligence could be true and that it was contrived by the artifice and dexterity of their enemies in order to abate the warmth and zeal that was used for their relief the arrival of which relief those enemies had much reason to apprehend and a longer delay in sending it would ease them of that terrible apprehension their forts and works towards the sea and in the harbour being almost finished'  'This discourse according to the natural custom of that nation and by the usual dialect of that language was held with such passion and vehemence that the standers by who understood not French did believe they were angry and that they used the duke rudely He being ready and informed that his breakfast was ready drew towards the door where the hangings were held up and in that very passage turning himself to speak with Sir Thomas Fryer a colonel of the army who was then speaking near his ear he was on a sudden struck over his shoulder upon the breast with a knife upon which without using any other words than that the villain has killed me and in the same moment pulling out the knife himself he fell down dead the knife having pierced his heart No man had ever seen the blow or the man who gave it but in the confusion they were in every man made his own conjecture and declared it as a thing known most agre  ing that it was done by the French from the angry discourse they thought they had heard from them and it was a kind of miracle that they were not all killed that instant The sober sort that preserved them from it having the same opinion of their guilt and only reserving them  for a more judicial examination and proceeding'  'In the crowd near the door there was found upon the ground a hat in the inside whereof there was sewed upon the crown a paper in which were writ four or five lines of that declaration made by the House of Commons in which they had stiled the duke an enemy to the kingdom and under it a short ejaculation towards a prayer It was easily enough concluded that the hat belonged to the person who had committed the murder but the difficulty  emained still as great who that person should be for the writing discovered nothing of the name and whosoever it was it was very natural to believe that he was gone far enough not to be found without a hat In this hurry one running one way another another way a man was seen walking before the door very composedly without a hat whereupon one crying out here's the fellow that killed the duke upon which others run thither every body asking which was he to which the man without the hat very composedly answered I am he Thereupon some of those who were most furious suddenly run upon the man with their drawn swords to kill him but others who were at least equally concerned in the loss and in the sense of it defended him himself with open arms very calmly and chearfully exposing himself to the sury and swords of the most enraged as being very willing to fall a sacrifice to their sudden anger rather than be kept for deliberate justice which he knew must be executed upon him'  'He was now enough known and easily discovered to be that Felton whom we mentioned before who had been a lieutenant in the army he was quickly carried into a private room by  the persons of the best condition some whereof were in authority who first thought fit so far to dissemble as to mention the duke only g  ievously wounded but not without hopes of recovery Upon which Felton smiled and said he knew well enough he had given him a blow that had determined all their hopes Being then asked at whose instigation he had performed that horrid wretched act he answered them with a wonderful assurance That they should not trouble themselves in that enquiry that no man living had cre  it or power enough with him to have engaged or disposed him to such an action that he had never entrusted his purpose or resolution to any man that it proceeded from himself and the impulse of his own conscience and that the motives thereunto will appear if his hat were found He spoke very frankly of what he had done and bore the reproaches of them that spoke to him with the temper of a man who thought he had not done amiss But after he had been in prison some time where he was treated without any rigour and with humanity enough and before and at his tryal which was about four months after at the King's Bench he behaved himself with great modesty and wonderful repentance being as he said convinced in his conscience that he had done wickedly and asked pardon of the King and Duchess and all the Duke's servants whom he acknowledged he had offended and very earnestly besought the judges that he might have his hand struck off with which he had performed that impious act before he should be put to death'  This is the account lord Olarendon gives in the first volume of his history of the fall of this great favourite which serves to throw a melancholy veil over the splendor of his life  and demonstrates the extreme vanity of exterior pomp and the danger those are exposed to who move on the precipice of power It serves to shew that of all kind of cruelty that which is the child of enthusiasm is the worst as it is founded upon something that has the appearance of principles and as it is more stedfast so does it diffuse more mischief than that cruelty which flows from the agitations of passion Felton blindly imagined he did God service by assassination and the same unnatural zeal would perhaps have prompted him to the murder of a thousand more who in his opinion were enemies to their country  The abovementioned historian remarks that there were several prophecies and predictions scattered about concerning the duke's death and then proceeds to the relation of the most astonishing story we have ever met with  As this anecdote is countenanced by so great a name I need make no apology for inserting it it has all the evidence the nature of the thing can admit of and is curious in itself  'There was an officer in the King's wardrobe in WindsorCastle of a good reputation for honesty and discretion and then about the age of fifty years or more This man had been bred in his youth in a school in the parish where Sir George Villiers the father of the Duke lived and had been much cherished and obliged in that season of his age by the said Sir George whom afterwards he never saw About six months before the miserable end of the duke of Buckingham about midnight this man being in his bed at Windsor where his office was and in very good health there appeared to him on the side of his bed a man of very venerable aspect who fixing his eyes upon him asked him if he  knew him the poor man half dead with fear and apprehension being asked the second time whether he remembered him and having in that time called to his memory the presence of Sir George Villiers and the very cloaths he used to wear in which at that time he used to be habited he answered him That he thought him to be that person he replied that he was in the right that he was the same and that he expected a service from him which was that he should go from him to his son the duke of Buckingham and tell him if he did not somewhat to ingratiate himself to the people or at least to abate the extreme malice they had against him he would be suffered to live but a short time and after this discourse he disappeared and the poor man if he had been at all waking slept very well till the morning when he believed all this to be a dream and considered it no otherwise'  'Next night or shortly after the same person appeared to him again in the same place and about the same time of the night with an aspect a little more severe than before and asking him whether he had done as he required him and perceiving he had not he gave him very severe reprehensions and told him he expected more compliance from him and that if he did not perform his commands he should enjoy no peace of mind but should be always pursued by him Upon which he propromisedto obey him'  'But the next morning waking exceedingly perplexed with the lively representation of all that had passed he considered that he was a person at such a distance from the duke that he knew not how to find any admittance into his presence much less any hope to be believed in what he should say so  with great trouble and unquietness he spent some time in thinking what he should do The poor man had by this time recovered the courage to tell him That in truth he had deferred the execution of his commands upon considering how difficult a thing it would be for him to get access to the duke having acquaintance with no person about him and if he could obtain admission to him he would never be able to persuade him that he was sent in such a manner but he should at best be thought to be mad or to be set on and employed by his own or the malice of other men to abuse the duke and so he should be sure to be undone The person replied as he had done before that he should never find rest till he should perform what he required and therefore he were better to dispatch it that the access to his son was known to be very easy and that few men waited long for him and for the gaining him credit he would tell him two or three particulars which he charged him never to mention to any person living but to the duke himself and he should no sooner hear them but he would believe all the rest he should say and so repeating his threats he left him'  'In the morning the poor man more confirmed by the last appearance made his journey to London where the court then was He was very well known to Sir Ralph Freeman one of the masters of the requests who had married a lady that was nearly allied to the duke and was himself well received by him To him this man went and tho' he did not acquaint him with all the particulars he said enough to him to let him see there was somewhat extraordinary in it and the knowledge he had of the sobriety and discretion of the man made the more impression on him He desired that by  his means he might be brought to the duke to such a place and in such a manner as should be thought fit affirming that he had much to say to him and of such a nature as would require much privacy and some time and patience in the hearing Sir Ralph promised he would speak first to the duke of him and then he should understand his pleasure and accordingly on the first opportunity he did inform him of the reputation and honesty of the man and then what he desired and all he knew of the matter The duke according to his usual openness and condescension told him that he was the next day early to hunt with the King that his horses should attend him to Lambeth Bridge where he would land by five o'Clock in the morning and if the man attended him there at that hour he would walk and speak with him as long as should be necessary Sir Ralph carried the man with him next morning and p  esented him to the duke at his landing who received him courteously and walked aside in conference near an hour none but his own servants being at that hour near the place and they and Sir Ralph at such a distance that they could not hear a word though the duke sometimes sp  ke and with great commotion which Sir Ralph the more easily perceived because he kept his eyes always fixed upon the duke having procured the conference upon somewhat he knew there was of extraordinary and the man told him in his return over the water that when he mentioned those particulars which were to gain him credit the substance whereof he said he durst not impart to him the duke's colour changed and he swore he could come by that knowledge only by the devil for that those particulars were known only to himself and to one person more who he was sure would never speak of it'  'The duke pursued his purpose of hunting but was observed to ride all the morning with great pensiveness and in deep thoughts without any delight in the exercise he was upon and before the morning was spent left the field and alighted at his mother's lodgings at Whitehall with whom he was shut up for the space of two or three hours the noise of their discourse frequently reaching the ears of those who attended in the next rooms and when the duke left her his countenance appeared full of trouble with a mixture of anger a countenance that was never before observed in him in any conversation with her towards whom he had a profound reverence and the countess herself was at the duke's leaving her found overwhelmed in tears and in the highest agony imaginable whatever there was of all this it is a notorious truth that when the news of the duke's murder which happened within a few months was brought to his mother she seemed not in the least degree surprized but received it as if she had foreseen it nor did afterwards express such a degree of sorrow as was expected from such a mother for the loss of such a son'  This is the representation which lord Clarendon gives of this extraordinary circumstance upon which I shall not presume to make any comment but if ever departed spirits were permitted to interest themselves with human affairs and as Shakespear expresses it revisit the glimpses of the moon it seems to have been upon this occasion at least there seems to be such rational evidence of it as no man however fortified against superstition can well resist  But let us now enter upon the life of the son of this great man who if he was inferior to his father as a statesman was superior in wit and wanted only application to have made a very  great figure even in the senate but his love of pleasure was immoderate which embarrassed him in the pursuit of any thing solid or praiseworthy  He was an infant when his father's murder was perpetrated and received his early education from several domestic tutors and was afterwards sent to the university of Cambridge when he had finished his course there he travelled with his brother lord Francis under the care of William Aylesbury esquire Upon his return which was after the breaking out of the civil wars he was conducted to Oxford and presented to his Majesty then there and entered into Christ Church Upon the decline of the King's cause the young duke of Buckingham attended Prince Charles into Scotland and was present in the year at the battle of Worcester where he escaped beyond sea and was soon after made knight of the garter He came afterwards privately into England and November married Mary the daughter and heir of Thomas lord Fairfax by whose interest he recovered all or most of his estate which he had lost before After the restoration at which time he is said to have possessed an estate of l per annum he was made one of the lords of the King's bedchamber and of the privy council lord lieutenant of Yorkshire and at last master of the horse  In the year being discovered to have maintained secret correspondence by letters and other transactions tending to raise mutinies among some of his Majesty's forces and stir up sedition among his people and to have carried on other traiterous designs and practices he absconded upon which a proclam  ion was issued the same year for apprehending him Mr Thomas Carte in his Life of the Duke of Ormond  B vl vol ii p    tells us  'that the duke's being denied the post of president of the North was probably the reason of his disaffection to the King and that just before the recess of the Parliament one Dr John Heydon was taken up for treasonable practices in sowing a sedition in the navy and engaging persons in a conspiracy to seize the Tower The man was a pretender to great skill in astrology but had lost much of his reputation by prognosticating the hanging of Oliver to his son Richard Cromwel and Thurloe who came to him in disguise for the calculation of nativities being dressed like distressed cavaliers He was for that put into prison and continued in confinement sixteen months whilst Cromwel outlived the prediction four years This insignificant fellow was mighty great with the duke of Buckingham who notwithstanding the vanity of the art and the notorious ignorance of the professor of it made him cast not only his own but the King's nativity a matter of dangerous curiosity and condemned by a statute which could only be said to be antiquated because it had not for a long time been put in execution This fellow he had likewise employed among others to excite the seamen to mutiny as he had given money to other rogues to put on jackets to personate seamen and to go about the country begging in that garb and exclaiming for want of pay while the people oppressed with taxes were cheated of their money by the great officers of the crown Heydon pretended to have been in all the duke's secrets for near four years past and that he had been all that time designing against the King and his government that his grace thought the present season favourable for the execution of his design and had his agents at work in the navy and in the kingdom to ripen the general discontents of the  people and dispose them to action that he had been importuned by him to head the first party he could get together and engage in an insurrection the duke declaring his readiness to appear and join in the undertaking as soon as the affair was begun Some to whom Heydon unbosomed himself and had been employed by him to carry letters to the duke of Buckingham discovered the design Heydon was taken up and a serjeant at arms sent with a warrant by his Majesty's express order to take up the duke who having defended his house by force for some time at least found means to escape The King knew Buckingham to be capable of the blackest designs and was highly incensed at him for his conduct last sessions and insinuating that spirit into the Commons which had been so much to the detriment of the public service He could not forbear expressing himself with more bitterness against the duke than was ever dropped from him upon any other occasion When he was sollicited in his behalf he frankly said that he had been the cause of continuing the war for the Dutch would have made a very lowsubmission had the Parliament continued their first vigorous vote of supplying him but the duke's cabals had lessened his interest both abroad and at home with regard to the support of the war In consequence of this resentment the King put him out of the privy council bedchamber and lientenancy of York ordering him likewise to be struck out of all commissions His grace absconding a procsamation was issued out requiring his appearance and surrender of himself by a certain day'  Notwithstanding this appearance of resentment against him yet Charles who was far from being of an implacable temper took Buckingham again into favour after he had made an humble submission  he was restored to his place in the council and in the bedchamber in and seemed perfectly confirmed in the good graces of the King who was perhaps too much charmed with his wit to consider him as an enemy  In the year the duke was supposed to be concerned in Blood's attempt on the life of the duke of Ormond This scheme was to have conveyed that nobleman to Tyburn and there to have hanged him for which purpose he was taken out of his coach in St James's Street and carried away by Blood and his son beyond Devonshire House Piccadilly but then rescued Blood afterwards endeavoured to steal the crown out of the Tower but was seized however he was not only pardoned but had an estate of five hundred pounds a year given him in Ireland and admitted into an intimacy with the King The reason of Blood's malice against the duke of Ormond was because his estate at Sorney was forfeited for his treason in the course of government and must have been done by any lord lieutenant whatever This together with the instigation of some enemy of the duke of Ormond's at court wrought upon him so that he undertook the assassination Mr Carte supposes that no man was more likely to encourage Blood in this attempt than the duke of Buckingham who he says was the most profligate man of his time and had so little honour in him that he would engage in any scheme to gratify an irregular passion The duke of Ormond had acted with some severity against him when he was detected in the attempt of unhinging the government which had excited so much resentment as to vent itself in this manner Mr Carte likewise charges the duchess of Cleveland with conspiring against Ormond but has given no reasons why he thinks she instigated the attempt  The duchess was cousin to the duke of Buckingham but it appears in the Annals of Gallantry of those times that she never loved him nor is it probable she engaged with him in so dangerous a scheme  That Buckingham was a conspirator against Ormond Mr Carte says there is not the least doubt and he mentions a circumstance of his guilt too strong to be resisted That there were reasons to think him the person who put Blood upon the attempt of the duke of Ormond says he  'cannot well be questioned after the following relation which I had from a gentleman Robert Lesly of Glaslough in the county of Monaghan esquire whose veracity and memory none that knew him will ever doubt who received it from the mouth of Dr Turner bishop of Ely The earl of Ossory came in one day not long after the affair and seeing the duke of Buckingham standing by the King his colour rose and he spoke to this effect My lord I know well that you are at the bottom of this late attempt of Blood's upon my father and therefore I give you fair warning if my father comes to a violent end by sword or pistol or the more secret way of poison I shall not be at a loss to know the first author of it I shall consider you as the assassin I shall treat you as such and wherever I meet you I shall pistol you though you stood behind the King's chair and I tell it you in his Majesty's presence that you may be sure I shall keep my word'  I know not whether this will be deemed any breach of decorum to the King in whose presence it was said but in my opinion it was an act of spirit and resentment worthy of a son when his father's life was menaced and the villain Blood who failed in the attempt was so much courted caressed and in high favour immediately afterwards  In June the duke was installed chancellor of the university of Cambridge and the same year was sent ambassador to the King of France who being pleased with his person and errand entertained him very nobly for several days together and upon his taking leave gave him a sword and belt set with Pearls and Diamonds to the value of pistoles He was afterwards sent to that King at Utrecht in June together with Henry earl of Arlington and George lord Hallifax He was one of the cabal at Whitehall and in the beginning of the session of Parliament February endeavoured to cast the odium of the Dutch war from himself upon lord Arlington another of the cabal In June he refigned the chancellorship of Cambridge About this time he became a great favourer of the Nonconformists February his grace and James earl of Salisbury Anthony earl of Shaftsbury and Philip lord Wharton were committed to the Tower by order of the House of Lords for a contempt in refusing to retract what they had said the day before when the duke immediately after his Majesty had ended his speech to both Houses endeavoured to shew from law and reason that the long prorogation was nulled and the Parliament was consequently dissolved  The chief of our author's works is  The Rehearsal a Comedy first acted on December It is said that the duke was assisted in writing this play by his Chaplain Dr Thomas Sprat Martin Clifford esquire master of the Charterhouse and Mr Samuel Butler author of Hudibras Jacob in his Lives of the Poets observes  'that he cannot exactly learn when his grace began this piece but this much says he  we may certainly gather from the plays ridiculed in it that it was before the end of and finished before because it had been several times rehearsed the players were perfect in their parts and all things in readiness for its acting before the great plague in and that then prevented it for what was then intended was very different from what now appears In that he called his poet Bilboa by which name Sir Robert Howard was the person pointed at During this interval many plays were published written in heroic rhime and on the death of Sir William Davenant whom Mr Dryden succeeded in the laurel it became still in greater vogue this moved the duke to change the name of his poet from Bilboa to Bayes'  This character of Bayes is inimitably drawn in it the various foibles of poets whether good bad or indifferent are so excellently blended as to make the most finished picture of a poeticâl coxcomb 'Tis such a masterpiece of true humour as will ever last while our English tongue is understood or the stage affords a good comedian to play it How shall I now avoid the imputation of vanity when I relate that this piece on being revived when I  T C  first appeared in the part of Bayes at the TheatreRoyal in CoventGarden in the year was in that one season continued to played upwards of forty nights to great audiences with continued mirthful applause As this is a truth I give it to the candid and let the relation take its chance though it should not be thought by some who may not abound in good nature that I only mean by this to pay due regard to the merit of the piece though it speaks for itself for without extraordinary merit in the writing it could never have gained such an uncommon run at the distance of fourscore years from its being first written when most of those  pieces were forgot which it particularly satirises or if remembered they were laughed into fame by the strong mockparodies with which this humorous piece of admirable burlesque abounds  Mr Dryden in revenge for the ridicule thrown on him in this piece exposed the duke under the name of Zimri in his Absalom and Achitophel This character drawn by Dryden is reckoned a masterpiece it has the first beauty which is truth it is a striking picture and admirably marked We need make no apology for inserting it here it is too excellent to pass unnoticed  In the first rank of these did Zimri stand  A man so various that he seemed to be  Not one but all mankind's epitome  Stiff in opinions always in the wrong  Was every thing by starts and nothing long  But in the course of one revolving moon  Was Chymist fidler statesman and buffoon  Then all for women painting rhiming drinking  Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking  Blest madman who could every hour employ  In something new to wish or to enjoy  Railing and praising were his usual themes  And both to shew his judgment in extremes  So over violent or over civil  That every man with him was God or devil  In squandering wealth was his peculiar art  Nothing went unrewarded but desert  Beggar'd by fools whom still he found too late  He had his jest and they had his estate  He laught himself from court then sought relief  By forming parties but could ne'er be chief  Thus wicked but in will of means berest  He left not faction but of that was left  It is allowed by the severest enemies of this nobleman that he had a great share of vivacity and quickness of parts which were particularly turned to ridicule but while he has been celebrated as a wit all men are silent as to other virtues for it is no where recorded that he ever performed one generous disinterested action in his whole life he relieved no distressed merit he never shared the blessing of the widow and fatherless and as he lived a profligate he died in misery a byword and a jest unpitied and unmourned  He died April Mr Wood says at his house in Yorkshire but Mr Pope informs us that he died at an inn in that county in very mean circumstances In his Epistle to lord Bathurst he draws the following affecting picture of this man who had possessed an estate of near l per annum expiring  In the worst inn's worst room with mat half hung  The floors of plaister and the walls of dung  On once a flockbed but repair'd with straw  With tapety'd curtains never meant to draw  The George and Garter dangling from that bed  Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red  Great Villiers liesalas how chang'd from him  That life of pleasure and that soul of whim  Gallant and gay in Cliveden's proud alcove  The bow'r of wanton Shrewsbury  The countess of Shrewsbury a woman abandoned to gallantries The earl her husband was killed by the duke of Buckingham and it has been said that during the combat she held the duke's horses in the habit of a page  and love  Or just as gay in council in a ring  Of mimick'd statesmen and their merry king  No wit to flatter left of all his store  No fool to laugh at which he valued more  There victor of his health of fortune friends  And same this lord of useless thousands ends  His grace's fate sage Cutler could foresee  And well he thought advised him 'live like me'  As well his grace replied 'like you Sir John  ' That I can do when all I have is gone'  Besides the celebrated Comedy of the Rehearsal the duke wrote the following pleces  An Epitaph on Thomas Lord Fairfax which has been often reprinted  A Short Discourse upon the Reasonableness of Men's having a Religion or Worship of God  This Piece met with many Answers to which the Duke wrote Replies  A Demonstration of the above Duty  Several Poems particularly Advice to a Painter to draw my Lord Arlington Timon a Satire on several Plays in which he was assisted by the Earl of Rochester a Consolatory Epistle to Julian Secretary to the Muses upon the Monument upon the Installment of the Duke of Newcastle the RumpParliament a Satire the Mistress the Lost Mistress a Description of Fortune  Several Speeches  MATTHEW SMITH Esquire  The following Account of this Gentleman came to our Hands too late to be inserted in the Chronological Series  THIS gentleman was the son of John Smith an eminent Merchant at Knaresborough in the country of York and descended from an ancient family of that name seated at WestHerrington  and Moreton House in the county pal of Durham Vide Philpot's Visitation of Durham in the Heralds Office page  He was a Barrister at Law of the InnerTemple and appointed one of the council in the North the fifteenth of King Charles I he being a Loyalist and in great esteem for his eminence and learning in his profession as still further appears by his valuable Annotations on Littleton's Tenures he left behind him in manuscript He also wrote some pieces of poetry and is the author of two dramatical performances  The Country Squire or the Merry Mountebank a Ballad Opera of one Act  The Masquerade du Ciel a Masque which was published the year that he died by John Smith of Knaresborough  Esq  eldest son and heir to this Matthew by Anne his wife daughter of Henry Roundell  esq  who dedicated it to the Queen  He was a person of the greatest loyalty and very early addicted to arms which made him extreamly zealous and active during the civil wars in joining with the Royalists particularly at the battle of MarstonMoor when he personally served under Prince Rupert for which he and his family were plundered and sequestered He also fined twice for Sheriff to avoid the oaths imposed in those days  THOMAS OTWAY  THIS excellent poet was not more remarkable for moving the tender passions than for the variety of fortune to which he was subjected We have some where read an observation  that the poets have ever been the least philosophers and were always unhappy in a want of firmness of temper and steadiness of resolution of the truth of this remark poor Mr Otway is a lively instance he never could sufficiently combat his appetite of extravagance and profusion to live one year in a comfortable competence but was either rioting in luxurious indulgence or shivering with want and exposed to the insolence and contempt of the world He was the son of Mr Humphry Otway rector of Wolbeding in Sussex and was born at Trottin in that country on March He received his education at Wickeham school near Winchester and became a commoner of Christ Church in Oxford in the beginning of the year He quitted the university without a degree and retired to London though in the opinion of some historians he went afterwards to Cambridge which seems very probable from a copy of verses of Mr Duke's to him between whom subsisted a sincere friendship till the death of Mr Otway When our poet came to London the first account we hear of him is that he commenced player but without success for he is said to have failed in want of execution which is so material to a good player that a tolerable execution with advantage of a good person will often supply the place of judgment in which it is not to be supposed Otway was deficient  Though his success as an actor was but indifferent yet he gained upon the world by the sprightliness of his conversation and the acuteness of his wit which it seems gained him the favour of Charles Fitz Charles earl of Plymouth one of the natural sons of King Charles II who procured him a cornet's Pommission in the new raised English forces designed for Flanders All who have written of Mr Otway observe that he returned from Flanders in very necessitous circumstances  but give no account how that reverse of fortune happened it is not natural to suppose that it proceeded from actual cowardice or that Mr Otway had drawn down any disgrace upon himself by misbehaviour in a military station If this had been the case he wanted not enemies who would have improved the circumstance and recorded it against him with a malicious satisfaction but if it did not proceed from actual cowardice yet we have some reason to conjecture that Mr Otway felt a strong disinclination to a military life perhaps from a consciousness that his heart failed him and a dread of misbehaving should he ever be called to an engagement and to avoid the shame of which he was apprehensive in consequence of such behaviour he in all probability resigned his commission which could not but disoblige the earl of Plymouth and expose himself to necessity What pity is it that he who could put such masculine strong sentiments into the mouth of such a resolute hero as his own Pierre should himself fail in personal courage but this quality nature withheld from him and he exchanged the chance of reaping laurels in the field of victory for the equally uncertain and more barren laurels of poetry The earl of Rochester in his Session of the Poets has thus maliciously recorded and without the least grain of wit the deplorable circumstances of Otway  Tom Otway came next Tom Shadwell's dear Zany  And swears for heroics he writes best of any  Don Carlos his pockets so amply had filled  That his mange was quite cured and his lice were all killed  But Apollo had seen his face on the stage  And prudently did not think fit to engage  The scum of a play house for the prop of an age  Mr Otway translated out of French into English the History of the Triumvirate the First Part of Julius Caesar Pompey and Crassus the Second Part of Augustus Anthony and Lepidus being a faithful collection from the best historians and other authors concerning the revolution of the Roman government which happened under their authority London in vo Our author finding his necessities press had recourse to writing for the stage which he did with various success his comedy has been blamed for having too much libertinism mixed with it but in tragedy he made it his business for the most part to observe the decorum of the stage He has certainly followed nature in the language of his tragedy and therefore shines in the passionate parts more than any of our English poets As there is something familiar and domestic in the fable of his tragedy he has little pomp but great energy in his expressions for which reason though he has admirably succeeded in the tender and melting parts of his tragedies he sometimes falls into too great a familiarity of phrase in those which by Aristotle's rule ought to have been raised and supported by the dignity of expression It has been observed by the critics that the poet has founded his tragedy of Venice Preserved on so wrong a plot that the greatest characters in it are those of rebels and traitors Had the hero of this pla  discovered the same good qualities in defence of his country that he shewed for his ruin and subversion the audience could not enough pity and admire him but as he is now represented we can only say of him what the Roman historian says of Catiline that his fall would have been glorious si pro Patria sec concidisset had he so fallen in the service of his country  Mr Charles Gildon in his Laws of Poetry stiles Mr Otway a Poet of the first Magnitude  and tells us and with great justice that he was perfect master of the tragic passions and draws them every where with a delicate and natural simplicity and therefore never fails to raise strong emotions in the soul I don't know of a stronger instance of this force than in the play of the Orphan the tragedy is composed of persons whose fortunes do not exceed the quality of such as we ordinarily call people of condition and without the advantage of having the scene heightened by the importance of the characters his inimitable skill in representing the workings of the heart and its affection is such that the circumstances are great from the art of the poet rather than from the figure of the persons represented The whole drama is admirably wrought and the mixture of passions raised from affinity gratitude love and misunderstanding between brethren ill usage from persons obliged slowly returned by the benefactors keeps the mind in a continual anxiety and contrition The sentiments of the unhappy Monimia are delicate and natural she is miserable without guilt but incapable of living with a consciousness of having committed an ill act though her inclination had no part in it Mrs Barry the celebrated actress used to say that in her part of Monimia in the Orphan she never spoke these words Ah poor Castalio without tears upon which occasion Mr Gildon observes that all the pathetic force had been lost if any more words had been added and the poet would have endeavoured in vain to have heightened them by the addition of figures of speech since the beauty of those three plain simple words is so great by the force of nature that they must have been weakened and obscured by the finest flowers of rhetoric  The tragedy of the Orphan is not without great blemishes which the writer of a crisicism  on it published in the Gentleman's Magazine has very judiciously and candidly shewn The impetuous passion of Polydore breaks out sometimes in a language not sufficiently delicate particularly in that celebrated passage where he talks of rushing upon her in a storm of love The simile of the bull is very offensive to chaste ears but poor Otway lived in dissolute times and his necessity obliged him to fan the harlotface of loose desire in compliance to the general corruption Monimia staying to converse with Polydor after he vauntingly discovers his success in deceiving her is shocking had she left him abruptly with a wildness of horror that might have thrown him under the necessity of seeking an explanation from Castalio the scene would have ended better would have kept the audience more in suspence and been an improvement of the consequential scene between the brothers but this remark is submitted to superior judges  Venice Preserved is still a greater proof of his influence over our passions and the faculty of mingling good and bad characters and involving their fortunes seems to be the distinguished excellence of this writer He very well knew that nothing but distressed virtue can strongly touch us with pity and therefore in this play that we may have a greater regard for the conspirators he makes Pierre talk of redressing wrongs and repeat all the common place of malecontents  To see the sufferings of my fellowcreatures  And own myself a man to see our senators  Cheat the deluded people with a shew  Of Liberty which yet they ne'er must taste of  They say by them our hands are free from fetters  Yet whom they please they lay in basest bonds  Bring whom they please to infamy and sorrow  Drive us like wrecks down the rough tide of power  Whilst no hold's left to save us from destruction  All that bear this are villains and I one  Not to rouse up at the great call of nature  And check the growth of these domestic spoilers  Who make us slaves and tell us 'tis our charter  Jaffier's wants and distresses make him prone enough to any desperate resolution yet says he in the language of genuine tenderness  But when I think what Belvidera feels  The bitterness her tender spirit tastes of  I own myself a coward bear my weakness  If throwing thus my arms about thy neck  I play the boy and blubber in thy bosom  Jaffier's expostulation afterwards is the picture of all who are partial to their own merit and generally think a relish of the advantages of life is pretence enough to enjoy them  Tell me why good Heaven  Thou mad'st me what I am with all the spirit  Aspring thoughts and elegant desires  That fill the happiest man ah rather why  Didst thou not form me sordid as my fate  Base minded dull and fit to carry burdens  How dreadful is Jaffier's soliloquy after he is engaged in the conspiracy  I'm here and thus the shades of night surround me  I look as if all hell were in my heart  And I in hell Nay surely 'tis so with me  For every step I tread methinks some fiend  Knocks at my breast and bids it not be quiet  I've heard how desperate wretches like myself  Have wandered out at this dead time of night  To meet the foe of mankind in his walk  Sure I'm so curst that though of Heaven forsaken  No minister of darkness cares to tempt me  Hell hell why sleep'st thou  The above is the most awful picture of a man plunged in despair that ever was drawn by a poet we cannot read it without terror and when it is uttered as we have heard it from the late justly celebrated Booth or those heartaffecting actors Garrick and Barry the flesh creeps and the blood is chilled with horror  In this play Otway catches our hearts by introducing the episode of Belvidera Private and public calamities alternately claim our concern sometimes we could wish to see a whole State sacrificed for the weeping Belvidera whose character and distress are so drawn as to melt every heart at other times we recover again in behalf of a whole people in danger There is not a virtuous character in the play but that of Belvidera and yet so amazing is the force of the author's skill in blending private and public concerns that the ruffian on the wheel is as much the object of pity as if he had been brought to that unhappy fate by some honourable action  Though Mr Otway possessed this astonishing talent of moving the passions and writing to the heart yet he was held in great contempt by some cotemporary poets and was several times unsuccessful in his dramatic pieces The merits of an author are seldom justly estimated till the next age after his decease while a man lives in the world he has passion prejudice private and public malevolence to combat his enemies are industrious to obscure his fame by drawing into light his private follies and personal malice is up in arms against every man of genius  Otway was exposed to powerful enemies who could not bear that he should acquire fame amongst whom Dryden is the foremost The enmity between Dryden and Otway could not proceed from jealousy for what were Otway's when put in the ballance with the amazing powers of Dryden like a drop to the ocean and yet we find Dryden declared himself his open enemy for which the best reason that can be assigned is that Otway was a retainer to Shadwell who was Dryden's aversion Dryden was often heard to say that Otway was a barren illiterate man but  'I confess says he he has a power which I have not'  and when it was asked him what power that was he answered  'moving the passions'  This truth was no doubt extorted from Dryden for he seems not to be very ready in acknowledging the merits of his cotemporaries In his preface to Du Fresnoy's Art of Painting which he translated he mentions Otway with respect but not till after he was dead and even then he speaks but coldly of him The passage is as follows  'To express the passions which are seated on the heart by outward signs is one great precept of the painters and very difficult to perform In poetry the very same passions and motions of the mind are to be expressed and in this consists the principal difficulty as well as the excellency of that art This says my author is the gift of Jupiter and to speak in the same Heathen language is the gift of our Apollo not to be obtained by pains or study if we are not born to it for the motions which are studied are never so natural as those which break out in the heighth of a real passion Mr Otway possessed this part as thoroughly as any of either the ancients or moderns I will not defend every thing in his Venice Preserved but I must bear this testimony to his memory that the passions  are truly touched in it though perhaps there is somewhat to be desired both in the grounds of them and the heighth and elegance of expression but nature is there which is the greatest beauty'  Notwithstanding our admiration of Dryden we cannot without some indignation observe how sparing he is in the praises of Otway who considered as a tragic writer was surely superior to himself Dryden enchants us indeed with flow'ry descriptions and charms us with what is called the magic of poetry but he has seldom drawn a tear and millions of radiant eyes have been witnesses for Otway by those drops of pity which they have shed Otway might be no scholar but that methinks does not detract from the merit of a dramatist nor much assist him in succeeding For the truth of this we may appeal to experience No poets in our language who were what we call scholars have ever written plays which delight or affect the audience Shakespear Otway and Southern were no scholars Ben Johnson Dryden and Addison were and while few audiences admire the plays of the latter those of the former are the supports of the stage  After suffering many eclipses of fortune and being exposed to the most cruel necessities poor Otway died of want in a public house on Towerhill in the  d  year of his age He had no doubt been driven to that part of the town to avoid the persecution of his creditors and as he durst not appear much abroad to sollicit assistance and having no means of getting money in his obscure retreat he perished It has been reported that Mr Otway whom delicacy had long deterred from borrowing small sums driven at last to the most grievous necessity ventured out of his lurking place almost naked and shivering and went into a coffeehouse on Towerhill  where he saw a gentleman of whom he had some knowledge and of whom he sollicited the loan of a shilling The gentleman was quite shocked to see the author of Venice Preserved begging bread and compassionately put into his hand a guinea  Mr Otway having thanked his benefactor retired and changed the guinea to purchase a roll as his stomach was full of wind by excess of fasting the first mouthful choaked him and instantaneously put a period to his days  Who can consider the fate of this gentleman without being moved to pity we can forgive his acts of imprudence since they brought him to so miserable an end and we cannot but regret that he who was endowed by nature with such distinguished talents as to make the bosom bleed with salutary sorrow should himself be so extremely wretched as to excite the same sensations for him which by the power of his eloquence and poetry he had raised for imaginary heroes We know indeed of no guilty part of Otway's life other than those fashionable faults which usually recommend to the conversation of men in courts but which serve for excuses for their patrons when they have not a mind to provide for them From the example of Mr Otway succeeding poets should learn not to place any confidence in the promises of patrons it discovers a higher spirit and reflects more honour on a man to struggle nobly for independance by the means of industry than servilely to wait at a great man's gate or to sit at his table meerly to afford him diversion Competence and independence have surely more substantial charms than the smiles of a courtier which are too frequently fallacious But who can read Mr Otway's story without indignation at those idols of greatness who demand worship from men of genius and yet can suffer them to live miserably and die neglected  The dramatic works of Mr Otway are  Alcibiades a Tragedy acted at the Duke of York's Theatre dedicated to Charles Earl of Middlesex The story of this play is taken from Cor Nepos and Plutarch's Life of Alcibiades  Titus and Berenice a Tragedy acted at the Duke's Theatre dedicated to John Earl of Rochester This play consists of but three Acts and is a translation from M Racine into heroic verse for the story see Suetonius Dionysius Jasephus to which is added the Cheats of Scapin a Farce acted the same year This is a translation from Moliere and is originally Terence's Phormio  Friendship in Fashion a Comedy acted at the Duke's Theatre dedicated to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex This play was revived at the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane and was damned by the audience on account of the immorality of the design and the obscenity of the dialogue  Don Carlos Prince of Spain a Tragedy acted at the Duke of York's Theatre This play which was the second production of our author written in heroic verse was acted with very great applause and had a run of thirty nights the plot from the Novel called DonCarlos  The Orphan or the Unhappy Marriage a Tragedy acted at the Duke of York's Theatre dedicated to her Royal Highness the Duchess It is founded on the History of Brandon and a Novel called the English Adventurer Scene Bohemia  The History and Fall of Caius Marius a Tragedy acted at the Duke's Thearre dedicated to Lord Viscount Fall  land The characters  of Marius Junior and Lavinia are borrowed literally from Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet which Otway has acknowledged in his Prologue  The Soldier's Fortune a Comedy acted at the Duke's Theatre This play is dedicated to Mr Bentley his Bookseller for the copy money as he tells us himself see Boccace's Novels Scarron's Romances  The Atheist or the Second Part of the Soldier's Fortune a Comedy acted at the Duke of York's Theatre dedicated to Lord Eland the eldest son to the Marquis of Hallifax  Venice Preserved or a Plot Discovered a Tragedy acted at the Duke's Theatre dedicated to the Duchess of Portsmouth Of this we have already given some account and it is so frequently acted that any enlargement would be impertinent It is certainly one of the most moving plays upon the English stage the plot from a little book giving an account of the Conspiracy of the Spaniards against Venice  Besides his plays he wrote several poems viz  The Poet's Complaint to his Muse or a Satire against Libels London in to  Windsor Castle or a Monument to King Charles the Second  Miscellany Poems containing a New Translation of Virgil's Ecologues Ovid's Elegies Odes of Horace London  He translated likewise the Epistle of Phaedra to Hyppolitus printed in the Translation of Ovid's Epistles by several hands He wrote the Prologue to Mrs Bhen's City Heiress Prefixed to Creech's Lucretius there is a copy of verses written by Mr Otway in praise of that translation  JOHN OLDHAM  THIS eminent satyrical poet was the son of the reverend Mr John Oldham a nonconformist minister and grandson to Mr John Oldham rector of NunEaton near Tedbury in Gloucestershire He was born at Shipton where his father had a congregation near Tedbury and in the same county on the th of August He was educated in grammar learning under the care of his father till he was almost fitted for the university and to be compleatly qualified for that purpose he was sent to Tedbridge school where he spent about two years under the tuition of Mr Henry Heaven occasioned by the earnest request of alderman Yeats of Bristol who having a son at the same school was desirous that Mr Oldham should be his companion which he imagined would much conduce to the advancement of his learning This for some time retarded Oldham in the prosecution of his own studies but for the time he lost in forwarding Mr Yeat's son his father afterwards made him an ample amends Mr Oldham being sent to Edmund Hall in Oxford was committed to the care of Mr William Stephens of which hall he became a bachelor in the beginning of June He was soon observed to be a good latin scholar and chiefly addicted himself to the study of poetry and other polite acquirements  Life of Mr Oldham prefixed to his works vol i edit Lond  In the year he took the degree of bachelor of arts but left the university before  he compleated that degree by determination being much against his inclination compelled to go home and live for some time with his father The next year he was very much afflicted for the death of his dear friend and constant companion Mr Charles Mervent as appears by his ode upon that occasion In a short time after he became usher to the freeschool at Croyden in Surry Here it was he had the honour of receiving a visit from the earl of Rochester the earl of Dorset Sir Charles Sedley and other persons of distinction meerly upon the reputation of some verses which they had seen in manuscript The master of the school was not a little surprized at such a visit and would fain have taken the honour of it to himself but was soon convinced that he had neither wit nor learning enough to make a party in such company This adventure was no doubt very happy for Mr Oldham as it encreased his reputation and gained him the countenance of the Great for after about three years continuance at Croyden school he was recommended by his good friend Harman Atwood  Esq  to Sir Edward Thurland a judge near Rygate in the same county who appointed him tutor to his two grandsons He continued in this family till After this he was sometime tutor to a son of Sir William Hicks a gentleman living within three or four miles of London who was intimately acquainted with a celebrated Physician Dr Richard Lower by whose peculiar friendship and encouragement Mr Oldham at his leisure hours studied physic for about a year and made some progress in it but the bent of his poetical genius was too strong to become a proficient in any school but that of the muses He freely acknowledges this in a letter to a friend written in July  While silly I all thriving arts refuse  And all my hopes and all my vigour lose  In service of the worst of jilts a muse  * * * * * * * * * * * *  Oft I remember did wise friends dissuade  And bid me quit the trifling barren trade  Oft have I tryed heaven knows to mortify  This vile and wicked bent of poetry  But still unconquered it remains within  Fixed as a habit or some darling sin  In vain I better studies there would sow  Oft have I tried but none will thrive or grow  All my best thoughts when I'd most serious be  Are never from its foul infection free  Nay God forgive me when I say my prayers  I scarce can help polluting them with verse  The fab'lous wretch of old revers'd I seem  Who turn whate'er I touch to dross of rhime  Our author had not been long in London before he was found out by the noblemen who visited him at Croyden and who now introduced him to the acquaintance of Mr Dryden But amongst the Men of quality he was most affectionately caressed by William Earl of Kingston who made him an offer of becoming his chaplain but he declined an employment to which servility and dependence are so necessarily connected The writer of his life observes that our author in his satire addressed to a friend who was about to quit the university and came abroad into the world lets his friend know that he was frighted from the thought of such an employment by the scandalous sort of treatment which often accompanies it This usage deters men of generous minds from placing themselves in such a station of life and hence persons of quality are frequently excluded from the improving agreeable  conversation of a learned and obsequious friend In this satire Mr Oldham writes thus  Some think themselves exalted to the sky  If they light on some noble family  Diet and horse and thirtypounds a year  Besides the advantage of his lordship's ear  The credit of the business and the state  Are things that in a youngster's sense sound great  Little the unexperienced wretch does know  What slavery he oft must undergo  Who tho' in silken stuff and cassoc drest  Wears but a gayer livery at best  When diner calls the implement must wait  With holy words to consecrate the meat  But hold it for a favour seldom known  If he be deign'd the honour to sit down  Soon as the tarts appear Sir Crape withdraw  Those dainties are not for a spiritual maw  Observe your distance and be sure to stand  Hard by the cistern with your cap in hand  There for diversion you may pick your teeth  Till the kind voider comes for your relief  For meer board wages such their freedom sell  Slaves to an hour and vassals to a bell  And if th' employments of one day be stole  They are but prisoners out upon parole  Always the marks of slavery remain  And they tho' loose still drag about their chain  And where's the mighty prospect after all  A chaplainship serv'd up and seven years thrall  The menial thing perhaps for a reward  Is to some slender benefice prefer'd  With this proviso bound that he must wed  My lady's antiquated waiting maid  In dressing only skill'd and marmalade  Let others who such meannesses can brook  Strike countenance to ev'ry great man's look  Let those that have a mind turn slave to eat  And live contented by another's plate  I rate my freedom higher nor will I  For food and rayment truck my liberty  But if I must to my last shift be put  To fill a bladder and twelve yards of gut  Richer with counterfeited woodenleg  And my right arm tyed up I'll choose to beg  I'll rather choose to starve at large than be  The gaudiest vassal to dependancy  The above is a lively and animated description of the miseries of a slavish dependance on the great particularly that kind of mortification which a chaplain must undergo It is to be lamented that gentlemen of an academical education should be subjected to observe so great a distance from those over whom in all points of learning and genius they may have a superiority Tho' in the very nature of things this must necessarily happen yet a high spirit cannot bear it and it is with pleasure we can produce Oldham as one of those poets who have spurned dependence and acted consistent with the dignity of his genius and the lustre of his profession  When the earl of Kingston found that Mr Oldham's spirit was too high to accept his offer of chaplainship he then caressed him as a companion and gave him an invitation to his house at HolmesPierpont in Nottinghamshire This invitation Mr Oldham accepted and went into the country with him not as a dependant but friend he considered himself as a poet and a clergyman and in consequence of that he did not imagine the earl was in the least degraded by making him his bosom companion Virgil was the friend of Maecenas and shone in the court of Augustus and if it should be observed that Virgil was a greater poet than Oldham it may be answered Maecenas was a greater man than  the Earl of Kingston and the court of Augustus much more brilliant than that of Charles II  Our author had not been long at the seat of this Earl before being seized with the small pox he died December in the th year of his age and was interred with the utmost decency his lordship attending as chief mourner in the church there where the earl soon after erected a monument to his memoryMr Oldham's works were printed at London in two volumes mo They chiefly consist of Satires Odes Translations Paraphrases of Horace and other authors Elegiac Verses Imitations Parodies Familiar Epistles cMr Oldham was tall of stature the make of his body very thin his face long his nose prominent his aspect unpromising and satire was in his eye His constitution was very tender inclined to a consumption and it was not a little injured by his study and application to learned authors with whom he was greatly conversant as appears from his satires against the Jesuits in which there is discovered as much learning as wit In the second volume of the great historical geographical and poetical Dictionary he is stiled the Darling of the Muses a pithy sententious elegant and smooth writer  "His translations exceed the original and his invention seems matchless His satire against the Jesuits is of special note he may be justly said to have excelled all the satirists of the age"  Tho' this compliment in favour of Oldham is certainly too hyperbolical yet he was undoubtedly a very great genius he had treasured in his mind an infinite deal of knowledge which had his life been prolonged he might have produced with advantage for his natural endowments seem to have been very great But he is not more to be reverenced as a Poet than for that gallant spirit of Independence he discovered and that magnaninity which scorned to stoop to any servile submissions for patronage He had  many admirers among his cotemporaries of whom Mr Dryden professed himself one and has done justice to his memory by some excellent verses with which we shall close this account  Farewel too little and too lately known  Whom I began to think and call my own  For sure our souls were near allied and thine  Cast in the same poetic mould with mine  One common note on either lyre did strike  And knaves and fools were both abhorred alike  To the same goal did both our studies drive  The last set out the soonest did arrive  Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place  While his young friend perform'd and won the race  O early ripe to thy abundant store  What could advancing age have added more  It might what nature never gives the young  Have taught the numbers of thy native tongue  But satire needs not those and wit will shine  Thro' the harsh cadence of a rugged line  A noble error and but seldom made  When poets are by too much force betray'd  Thy gen'rous fruits tho' gather'd e'er their prime  Still shewed a quickness and maturing time  But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhime  Once more hail and farewel Farewel thou young  But ah too short Marcellus of our tongue  Thy brows with ivy and with laurels bound  But fate and gloomy night encompass thee around  DILLON WENTWORTH Earl of ROSCOMMON  THIS nobleman was born in Ireland during the lieutenancy of the earl of Straf  ord in the reign of King Charles I Lord Strafford was his godfather and named him by his own  irname He passed some of his first years in his native country till the earl of Strafford imagining when the rebellion first broke out that his father who had been converted by archbishop Usher to the Protestant religion would be exposed to great danger and be unable to protect his family sent for his godson and placed him at his own seat in Yorkshire under the tuition of Dr Hall afterwards bishop of Norwich by whom he was instructed in Latin and without learning the common rules of grammar which he could never retain in his memory he attained to write in that language with classical elegance and propriety and with so much ease that he chose it to correspond with those friends who had learning sufficient to support the commerce When the earl of Strafford was prosecuted lord Roscommon went to Caen in Normandy by the advice of bishop Usher to continue his studies under Bochart where he is said to have had an extraordinary impulse of his father's death which is related by Mr Aubrey in his miscellany  'Our author then a boy of about ten years of age one day was as it were madly extravagant in playing getting over the tables boards c He was wont to be sober enough They who observed him said God grant  this proves no ill luck to him In the heat of this extravagant fit he cries out my father is dead A fortnight after news came from Ireland that his father was dead This account I had from Mr Knowles who was his governor and then with him since secretary to the earl of Strafford and I have heard his lordship's relations confirm the same'  The ingenious author of lord Roscommon's life publish'd in the Gentleman's Magazine for the month of May has the following remarks on the above relation of Aubrey's  'The present age is very little inclined to favour any accounts of this sort nor will the name of Aubrey much recommend it to credit it ought not however to be omitted because better evidence of a fact is not easily to be found than is here offered and it must be by preserving such relations that we may at least judge how much they are to be regarded If we stay to examine this account we shall find difficulties on both sides here is a relation of a fact given by a man who had no interest to deceive himself and here is on the other hand a miracle which produces no effect the order of nature is interrupted to discover not a future but only a distant event the knowledge of which is of no use to him to whom it is revealed Between these difficulties what way shall be found Is reason or testimony to be rejected I believe what Osborne says of an appearance of sanctity may be applied to such impulses or anticipations  "Do not wholly slight them because they may be true but do not easily trust them because they may be false"  Some years after he travelled to Rome where he grew familiar with the most valuable remains of antiquity applying himself particularly to the knowledge  of medals which he gained in great perfection and spoke Italian with so much grace and fluency that he was frequently mistaken there for a native He returned to England upon the restoration of King Charles the IId and was made captain of the band of pensioners an honour which tempted him to some ext  avagancies In the gaieties of that age says Fenton he was tempted to indulge a violent passion for gaming by which he srequently hazarded his life in duels and exceeded the bounds of a moderate fortune This was the fate of many other men whose genius was of no other advantage to them than that it recommended them to employments or to distinction by which the temptations to vice were multiplied and their parts became soon of no other use than that of enabling them to succeed in debauehery  A dispute about part of his estate obliging him to return to Ireland he resigned his post and upon his arrival at Dublin was made captain of the guards to the duke of Ormond  When he was at Dublin he was as much as ever distempered with the same fatal affection for play which engaged him in one adventure which well deserves to be related  'As he returned to his lodgings from a gaming table he was attacked in the dark by three ruffians who were employed to assassinate him The earl defended himself with so much resolution that he dispatched one of the aggressors while a gentleman accidentally passing that way interposed and disarmed another the third secured himself by flight This generous assistant was a disbanded officer of a good family and fair reputation who by what we call partiality of fortune to avoid censuring the iniquities of the times wanted even a plain suit of clothes to make a decent appearance at the castle but his lordship on this occasion presenting him to the duke of Ormond with great importunity prevailed  with his grace that he might resign his post of captain of the guards to his friend which for about three years the gentleman enjoyed and upon his death the duke returned the commission to his generous benefactor'  Fenton  His lordship having finished his affairs in Ireland he returned to London was made master of the horse to the dutchess of York and married the lady Frances eldest daughter of the earl of Burlington and widow of colonel Courtnay  About this time in imitation of those learned and polite assemblies with which he had been acquainted abroad particularly one at Caen in which his tutor Bochartus died suddenly while he was delivering an oration he began to form a society for refining and fixing the standard of our language In this design his great friend Mr Dryden was a particular assistant a design says Fenton of which it is much more easy to conceive an agreeable idea than any rational hope ever to see it brought to perfection This excellent design was again set on foot under the ministry of the earl of Oxford and was again defeated by a conflict of parties and the necessity of attending only to political disquisitions for defending the conduct of the administration and forming parties in the Parliament Since that time it has never been mentioned either because it has been hitherto a sufficient objection that it was one of the designs of the earl of Oxford by whom Godolphin was defeated or because the statesmen who succeeded him have not more leisure and perhaps less taste for literary improvements Lord Roscommon's attempts were frustrated by the commotions which were produced by King James's endeavours to introduce alterations  in religion He resolved to retire to Rome alledging  'it was best to sit next the chimney when the chamber smoaked'  It will no doubt surprize many of the present age and be a just cause of triumph to them if they find that what Roscommon and Oxford attempted in vain shall be carried into execution in the most masterly manner by a private gentleman unassisted and unpensioned The world has just reason to hope this from the publication of an English Dictionary long expected by Mr Johnson and no doubt a design of this sort executed by such a genius will be a lasting monument of the nation's honour and that writer's merit  Lord Roscommon's intended retreat into Italy already mentioned on account of the troubles in James the IId's reign was prevented by the gout of which he was so impatient that he admitted a repellent application from a French empyric by which his distemper was driven up into his bowels and put an end to his life in  Mr Fenton has told us that the moment in which he expired he cried out with a voice that expressed the most intense fervour of devotion  My God my father and my friend  Do not forsake me at my end  Two lines of his own version of the hymn Dies irae Dies illa  The same Mr Fenton in his notes upon Waller has given Roscommon a character too general to be critically just  'In his writings says he we view the image of a mind which was naturally serious and solid richly furnished and adorned with all the ornaments of art and science and those ornaments  unaffectedly disposed in the most regular and elegant order His imagination might have probably been fruitful and sprightly if his judgment had been less severe but that severity delivered in a masculine clear succinct stile contributed to make him so eminent in the didactical manner that no man with justice can affirm he was ever equalled by any of our nation without confessing at the same time that he is inferior to none In some other kinds of writing his genius seems to have wanted fire to attain the point of perfection but who can attain it'  From this account of the riches of his mind who would not imagine that they had been displayed in large volumes and numerous persormandes Who would not after the perusal of this character be surprized to find that all the proofs of this genius and knowledge and judgment are not sufficient to form a small volume But thus it is that characters are generally written We know somewhat and we imagine the rest The observation that his imagination would have probably been more fruitful and sprightly if his judgment had been less severe might if we were inclined to cavil be answer'd by a contrary supposition that his judgment would have been less severe if his imagination had been more fruitful It is ridiculous to oppose judgment and imagination to each other for it does not appear that men have necessarily less of the one as they have more of the other  We must allow in favour of lord Roscommon what Fenton has not mentioned so distinctly as he ought and what is yet very much to his honour That he is perhaps the only correct writer in verse before Addison and that if there are not so many beauties in his composition as in those of some of his contemporaries there are at least fewer faults Nor is this his highest praise for  Mr Pope has celebrated him as the only moral writer in Charles the IId's reign  Unhappy Drydenin all Charles's days  Roscommon only boasts unspotted lays  Mr Dryden speaking of Roscommon's essay on translated verse has the following observation  'It was that says he that made me uneasy till I tried whether or no I was capable of following his rules and of reducing the speculation into practice For many a fair precept in poetry is like a seeming demonstration in mathematics very specious in the diagram but failing in mechanic operation I think I have generally observed his instructions I am sure my reason is sufficiently convinced both of their truth and usefulness which in other words is to confess no less a vanity than to pretend that I have at least in some places made examples to his rules'  This declaration of Dryden will be found no more than one of those cursory civilities which one author pays to another and that kind of compliment for which Dryden was remarkable For when the sum of lord Roscommon's precepts is collected it will not be easy to discover how they can qualify their reader for a better performance of translation than might might have been attained by his own reflexions  They are however here laid down  'Tis true composing is the nobler part  But good translation is no easy art  For tho' materials have long since been found  Yet both your fancy and your hands are bound  And by improving what was writ before  Invention labours less but judgment more  Each poet with a different alent writes  One praises one instructs another bites  Horace did ne'er aspire to epic bays  Nor lofty Maro stoop to lyric lays  Examine how your humour is inclin'd  And watch the ruling passion of your mind  Then seek a poet who your way does bend  And chuse an author as you chuse a friend  United by this sympathetic bond  You grow familiar intimate and fond  Your thoughts your words your stiles your souls agree  No longer his interpreter but he  Take then a subject proper to expound    But moral great and worth a poet's voice  For men of sense despise a trivial choice  And such applause it must expect to meet  As would some painter busy in the street  To copy bulls and bears and every sign  That calls the staring sots to nasty wine  Take pains the genuine meaning to explore  There sweat there strain tug the laborious oar  Search every comment that your care can find  Some here some there may hit the poet's mind  Yet be not blindly guided by the throng  The multitude is always in the wrong  When things appear unnatural or hard  Consult your author with himself compar'd  Who knows what blessings Phaebus may bestow  And future ages to your labours owe  Such secrets are not easily found out  But once discovered leave no room for doubt  Truth stamps conviction in your ravish'd breast  And peace and joy attend the glorious guest  They who too faithfully on names insist  Rather create than dissipate the mist  And grow unjust by being over nice  For superstition virtue turns to vice  Let Crassus ghost and Labienus tell  How twice in Parthian plains their legions fell  Since Rome hath been so jealous of her fame  That few know Pacorus or Monaeses name  And 'tis much safer to leave out than add    Abstruse and mystic thoughts you must express  With painful care but seeming easiness  For truth shines brightest thro' the plainest dress  Your author always will the best advise  Fall when he falls and when he rises rise  Nothing could have induced us to have laboured thro' so great a number of cold unspirited lines but in order to shew that the rules which my lord has laid down are meerly common place and must unavoidably occur to the mind of the most ordinary reader They contain no more than this that the author should be suitable to the translator's genius that he should be such as may deserve a translation that he who intends to translate him should endeavour to understand him that perspicuity should be studied and unusual or uncouth names sparingly inserted and that the stile of the original should be copied in its elevation and depression These are the commonplace rules delivered without elegance or energy which have been so much celebrated but how deservedly let our unprepossess'd readers judge  Roscommon was not without his merit he was always chaste and sometimes harmonious but the grand requisites of a poet elevation fire and invention were not given him and for want  of these however pure his thoughts he is a languid unentertaining writer  Besides this essay on translated verse he is the author of a translation of Horace's Art of poetry with some other little poems and translations published in a volume of the minor poets  Amongst the MSS of Mr Coxeter we found lord Roscommon's translation of Horace's Art of Poetry with some sketches of alterations he intended to make but they are not great improvements and this translation of all his lordship's pieces is the most unpoetical  END the of SECOND VOLUME
