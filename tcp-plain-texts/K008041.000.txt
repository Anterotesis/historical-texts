 THE REGISTEROFFICE A FARCE OF TWO ACTS  ACTED at the THEATREROYAL in  DruryLane  By J REED  DUBLIN Printed for H SAUNDERS R WATTS and W WHITESTONE Booksellers in  Skinnerrow  MDCCLXI  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr KING  THE Bard whose Hopes on Comedy depend  Must strive Instruction with Delight to blend  While He who bounds his less aspiring Views  To  Farce  the  Combrush  of the  comic  Muse  With Pleasantry alone may fill the Scene  His Business chiefly this to cure the Spleen  To raise the pensive Mind from  Grave  to  Gay  And help to laugh a thoughtful Hour away  If any quibbling Wit dispute my Thesis  Pd ask the Use of half our  petty Pieces  Nay Sirs My Question still shall higher climb  Pray what's the Use of  fullpric'd  Pantomime  How does the pleasur'd Eye with Rapture glance  When mingling Witches join in  hobbling  Dance  When wriggling  Harlequin  the magic Sage  In hornpipe Amble traverses the Stage  When trembling  Pierrot  in his Quivering shines  An Ostrich enters or a Serpent twines  When  headless  Taylors raise the laughing Fit  Or flourdredg'd Footmen twirl upon a Spit  But oh How loud the Roar how dear the Rumble  When Scaffolds MortarBoards and Bricklayers tumble  When  Clodpate  runs or limps or quaintly rears  From LaundressTub his  anabaptist  Ears  While all the Wit these Exhibitions draw  Is comprehended in a CryO  Laa  Our Author in this awful Court of  Drury  Submits his Cause to an impartial Jury  No friendly Junto he tonight employs  To catch by  favouring  Hands the public Voice  He founds on  British  Candour all his Trust  Convinc'd a  British  Audience will be Just  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  HARWOOD BY Mr AUSTIN  FRANKLY Mr BADDELEY  GULWELL Mr PACKER  WILLIAMS Mr ACKMAN  Lord BRILLIANT Mr CASTLE  Capt Le BRUSH Mr KING

prithee  Harwood  what in the Name of Mystery hath brought thee to town at this unfashion∣able Time of the Year  Har  The Loss of my fair Housekeeper  Fran  The Loss of  Maria  Is she dead  Har  Worse my dear  Frankly  elop'd  Fran  Elop'd Why I thought you had so great a Re∣gard for each other that you had been as inseparable as old Age and Avarice or a Coquette and a LookingGlass  Har  I thought so too but Women are as changeable as their Dresses there is no answering for the Humours of the Sex tho' Faith I cannot altogether excuse myself in the Affair of our Parting  Fran  Prithee explain  Har  You know  Charles  after the Death of my Wise whom with Shame I must own I never thoroughly lov'd as she was not mine but my Father's Choice I prevail'd on  Maria  who was either beggar'd by an unnatural Fa∣ther or a villainous Uncle to take upon her the Care of my Family Her good Sense Beauty and Behaviour imperceptibly won my Heart but my Pride forbidding me to marry a Woman without a Fortune I made use of every Means in my Power togain her Affections  Fran  I understand you to gain them in the old Way  Har  But the fair  Maria  was so much upon her Guard or so obstinately virtuous that nothing but downright Matrimony would induce her to listen to my Sollicitations  Fran  An unreasonable Gipsy And so you dropp'd the Affair  Har  Not quite so hasty in your Conclusions good SirAfter a vast Profusion of lying and swearing which fail'd of the desir'd Success I determin'd to make my grand Attack  Fran  Resolv'd like a Man of Spirit  Har  And accordingly one Night the last Week  When ev'ry Eye was clos'd and the pale Moon  And Stars alone shone conscious of the Theft  Hot with the  Gallic  Grape and high in Blood  and so forth I began my Assault  Fran  Bravo  Har  It would be needless to tell thee I was repuls'd In short the dear lovely affronted virtuous  Maria  so highly resented the Familiarity that she instantly left the House and from that Hour I have not set Eye on the fair Enslaver  Fran  And so you are come to Town to hire a new Housekeeper  Har  No to marry my old one if I can be so fortu∣nate as to encounter herI must have herI cannot be easy without herI have some faint Hopes of meet∣ing with her as she was seen on the  London  Road Which do you think the most likely Way of finding her out  Fran  Humthis requires some thoughtayPray what do you think of a penitential Advertisement  Har  No hang it Should I be discovered for the Au∣thor it would make me too ridiculous  Fran  That's true I must confessstaydo you ima∣gine she will be looking after another Place  Har  I fancy she will as her Finances must below  Fran  Then the only Method I can put you into is an Application to some of our IntelligenceWarehouses  Har  I don't understand your cant Phrase Pray what do you mean by an IntelligenceWarehouse  Fran  A RegisterOffice  Har  Oh I take you the Places where Servants may be heard ofPray were not these Offices invented by the ingenious Author of  Tom Jones  Fran  They wereThe Project hath been and still is of great Utility to the Publick but as there is no general Rule without an Exception this laudable Institution hath been strangely perverted thro' the Villainy and Avarice of some of it's ManagersThere is an old Rascal in this Neighbourhood who hath amass'd a tolerable Fortune by Abuses of this Kind His Office is frequented by Per∣sons of every Degree and among it's other Con∣veniences the good old Trade of Pimping is carried on with great Success and Decency I believe as many Proselytes have been made to the Flesh by the Knavery of this Rascal as by the most successful Bawd in Town  Har  So I find the old Fellow is a Genius in his Way  Fran  A complete one Our old Schoolfellow  Jack Williams  is his Clerk from which honourable Employ∣ment he retires in a few Days to a Stewardship to which I have lately recommended himBy his Means I have often had an Opportunity of overhearing some Passages which have afforded great Humour and Entertainment  Har  If my Heart were not so full for the Loss of this dear Woman I could like to throw away an Hour in an Amusement of this Kind  Fran  That you may this very Morning if you please I'll introduce you It will help to dissipate your Melan∣choly for the Loss of your fair Deserter  Har  Psha I am not in a Humour to relish any Plea∣santry excuse me  Charles  some other Time I'll ac∣cept of your Offer  Fran  Since you are so serious I must insist on your going Why thou art as melancholy as a superseded PlacemanCome come  George  don't despair I war∣rant we will find out  it's  Charmer in a few DaysYou must go with me  Harwood  Har  Then I am ready to attend you  Fran  Allons donc  Exeunt  Scene a RegisterOffice  Enter WILLIAMS  Wil  The Business of the

Direction of so conscientious a Person as Mr  Gulwell  instead of a publick Good becomes a publick EvilMy upright Master seldom feels any Reflections of this Kind Avarice is his leading Principle and

commonly called  Brush  but  le Brush  is the Name my Family was  ariginally  nay even so lately as  Harry  the  Eight  known by a Name Sir given by Way of Distinction to one of my  Auntsisters  that was General under  Allafraid  the Great for so victoriously  sweeping  away  hole  Armies of the EnemyOur Family had all their Estate  consisti∣cated  in the Broils between the  Yorkshire  and  Lancashire  Line so that their  Predecessors  have been a little out of Repair to the present Time and the Name  regenerated  into plain  Brush  Gul  Sir as your Family hath been so long reduced how came you by the Education you talk of  Capt  Sir I was taught to read and write  freegratis  for nothing at a Charity School and attended Lord  Pli∣ant  to the University where you know there is many Opportunities for a Man of  Talons  to improve himself  Gul  Right Sir such Opportunities that I have fre∣quently known a Valet return from thence full as wise as his Master  Capt  Egad Sir I see very plainly you're a Gentle∣man that knows what's what  Gul  And pray Captain what were your favourite Studies at College  Capt  Logic and Poetry the only two Studies sit for a Gentleman as the first will teach you to cheat the De∣vil and the last to charm the Ladies  Gul  I should be glad to have a little Conference with you on the latter for I am a bit of a Dabler in it  Capt  Then  serously  as a Friend I would  dissuade  you to look out damn'd sharp or upon my Soul you'll catch a Tartar For I have not met with any Body that was fit to hold the Candle to me in Poetry for a long  Serus  of

where I was Recruiting I had the good Fortune to pick up a maiden Lady pretty well stricken in Years with a Fortune of three thousand Pounds in the Stocks Now Sir as the Interest of the Money and my present Pay will scarce be sufficient to maintain me for you know Sir a Soldier and a Gentleman is  anonymous  Characters and a Man in my Office must live up to his DignityI say Sir as the Interest of Mo∣ney is damn'd low I have a Desire to purchase a Cornecy or a Company of Foot that I may be better able to live like a Gentleman  Gul  Posts of this kind frequently fall under my Dis∣posal I think it a prudent and honourable Intention in you as in case of Mortality the Provision for your Lady will be larger  Capt  Pho Dam the old Hag I don't care if the Devil had her I have been married above two Months and was as tired of her in the first Fortnight as a mo∣dern Man of Quality after a Twelvemonth's Cohabita∣tion I have for these five Weeks past done every thing in my Power to break her Heart but egad it is made of such tough Stuff such  penctrable  Stuff as my Friend  Shakespear  calls it that I believe I shan't be able to  defect  the Business dammeIn short my Disappointment hath thrown me into such a hellish  Deel ha me  that the Devil fetch me if I know for the Blood and Soul of me how  to  execrate  myself out of it For I want to be rid of her most cursedly that's certain  Gul  There are Waysmany Ways Captain by which such a Business may be brought about  Capt  True Sir My Serjeant  Tom Spaterdash  who is a damn'd  cute  Dog as any in the  Coppercan  System You don't

would beg leave to ask why you are so desirous of parting with a Woman who hath been so great a Benefactress to you I should be afraid your Patron and his Lady would resent such BehaviourWill you be

Pliant  is my Friend but Truth is more my Friend And tho' some Persons will affirm that Truth ought not to be spoken at all Times yet no Philosopher not no body else would ever venture to affirm but that Truth ought to be spoken at sometimeswhich being grantedI say Sir which being granted it must follownecessarily fol∣low Sir that tho' Truth ought not to be spoken at all Times Occasions and Seasons yet seasonable Truths may be occasionally spoken at all TimesBut this Sir is the very Profundity of Logic and consequently out of the Reach of  every  Capacity wherefore I shall descend into the  Spear  of common Sense to be the better under∣stood  Gul  Sir I must acknowledge that your Arguments are very Sublime and Logical but yet they are no An∣swer to my QuestionPerhaps I have been too rude to press you on the Occasion there may be some  Lady  in the Case who  Capt  Egad Sir you're in the Right I had not been Married above ten Days till I fell most  consumedly  in Love with a Niece

but not as one may say aaan absolute DislikeBut Sir to  proceed  in my StoryIf I could but break my Wife's Heart I should assuredly marry my Niece in less than a Month after her Decease A  seprate Maintainance  won't do or Mrs  Le Brush  should have it with all my Soul but if we part you know all Hopes of breaking her Heart are overShe hath offered to  seprate  if I would give her two hundred Pounds in ready  Rhino  and al∣low her for Life an annual Provision of fifty Pounds  per Annum  every Year  Gul  Which you have refused I suppose  Capt  Refused Most certainly Sir I was almost  pu∣trified  with Astonishment at the  agregious  Impudence of her DemandI shall not consent to allow here a Shilling more as Fifteen a YearShe may live very comfortably very comfortably on it in the  North  Gul  Truly Sir I think fifteen Pounds a Year a very genteel Allowance especially as she brought you so small a Trifle as Three Thousand  Capt  I think so too egad But these old Devils have no Conscience at all damme Well Sir you'll give me an Answer as soon as possibleYou may hear of me at Mrs  Dresden  's a Milliner under the  Peeaches  in  Com∣monGarden  Gul  writing  Very well SirI'll

be a great Slur and Reproach to my Reputation if I named them in my Will and you know one would wish to die with a  good Name  Besides he convinced me of the exceeding great Sinfulness of leaving any

was not privy to the Fraud of your Brotherinlaw's signing a  counterfeit  Will but on∣ly called hastily in to witness the Signature The other Evidence is dead therefore there is no Danger from that QuarterDon't be afraid Mr  Tricket  I'll answer for the Validity of the WillI thought you had known the Law better in these Cases than to be afraid of such a Bugbear as a Chancery Suit  Trick  You

Snarewell  that you have been the Cause of bringing many a young Creature to Shame It is but therefore  Poetical  Justice that you should be obliged to contribute to the Support of  ruin'd  Innocence

resolved not to oppose the Execution of itNow My dear  Maria  I have two Favours to ask of you both of which I hope you will grant me  Ma  Sir you have been my Deliverer and cannot ask any Thing Consistent with Honour that I shall refuse  Har  First then I must desire you to forgive the Cause of your quitting my House in the next Place that you will return with me to  Somersetshire  not in the Capacity of a Housekeeper but a WifeDon't imagine the Re∣covery of your Fortune hath induced me to this Proposal Mr  Frankly  can convince you the sole lntent of my Journey to Town was to marry

 hath turn'd out a lucky Affair  Har  Fortunate for me indeed And were I not fully convinced of the great Service arising to the Commu∣nity from the Institution and proper Management of a  RegisterOffice  I should be apt to conclude from the Trick Villainy and Chicanery I have seen practised within this Hour that none but a  Fool  or a  Knave  would ever set foot within it's Walls  Exeunt  The END  ADVERTISEMENT  As there is a  palpable Similarity  between the Characters of Mrs COLE in the  Minor  and Mrs SNAREWELL in the foregoing Performance it may not be unnecessary to declare that the  RegisterOffice  was put into Mr  Foote  's Hands in  August  on his Promise of playing it at one of the PatentTheatres in the ensuing Season
