dumb or blind as occasion shall requireIt will also enable you to imitate any voice as well as assume whatever character you please  HARLEQUIN  Assume whatever character I pleaseI am told London swarms with people who can do that without a magic ringOne part of its virtue I can easily conceive to be inestimable for I am not to learn that great things may be done there by having what they call the command of a few voices  FAIRY  Yes yesYou won't find liberty of speech the least of my favours  HARLEQUIN  O I know the first men in the kingdom are speechmakers and practise their trade not only all day but sometimes all night too But however fond I may be of the speaking Harlequins my strong attachment is to my brethren of the  sword  FAIRY  I perceive you have been in London beforeThen you

The  Fairy  appears in a Tree and speaks  Behold me hereAccompanied by some of my invisible agents you shall repair to the spot where you first saw me which  may perhaps ere this by the spells of the wicked Nordin be rendered a mere desert You will at worst find some vestiges which may lead to the well and its neighbourhood there I'll meet you In the mean time  Mr Dumbâ–ª  and his  Intended  will
