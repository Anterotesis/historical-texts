 A FOURTH DISCOURSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR    In VIEW of the Present Controversy between INFIDELS and APOSTATES  Canes qui  oblatrant contra Inquisitionem Veritatis  Clem Alex  By THOMAS WOOLSTON sometime Fellow of  SidneyCollege  in  Cambridge  LONDON Printed for the Author and Sold by him next Door below the  Star  in  Aldermanbury  and by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price One Shilling  TO THE Right Reverend Father in GOD  FRANCIS  Lord Bishop of St ASAPH  MY LORD  _IF the  Convocation  had been sitting I would have made this Dedication to them and humbly implored of them what for their Love to the Fathers they would readily have granted a Recommendation of these my  Discourses  on  Miracles  to the  Clergy  But being unhappily disappointed of a Session of that  Reverend  and  Learned  Body for whose wise Debates and orthodox Votes I have such a Veneration as is not to be express'd in a few Words I presently  turn'd my Thoughts on your  Lordship  to whom a  Dedication  is due because of your Respect often declared for the Authority of the Fathers which induces me to think you now approve of the Use I have made of them  But what I am here to applaud your  Lordship  for is your  Discourse  call'd  Difficulties and Discouragements  c That admirable Satire against modern Orthodoxy and Persecution How was I tickled in the Perusal of it It is plainly the Sense of your Soul or you had set your Name to it And if the Temptation of Praise for it had not been too great to be resisted I could have wish'd you had always conceal'd your self and then you had not written against the Grain an aukward Piece on  Church Power  like a Retractation to reingratiate your self with some Ecclesiastical  Noodles  whom you no more than I need to care for  I have sometimes wondered  My Lord  where and when the Great Mr  Grounds  imbibed his notable Notions about Religion and Liberty for he suck'd them not in with his Mothers Milk who I suppose train'd him up in the Belief of Christianity But when I consider'd that he was once the  Pupil  of Mr  Hare  at  Cambridge  my wonder ceas'd Under your  Lordship  's Tuition it seems he laid the Foundation of his distinguish'd Learning and Opinions His Pupillage will be your immortal Honour I wonder none of the Writers against him have as yet celebrated your Praise for it How does he imitate and resemble his  Tutor  in Principles I can't say he surpasses you since there is such a Freedom of Thought and Expression in your  Difficulties  c so strongly savouring of Infid  ty that he has not as yet equall'd  Upon your  Lordship  's Advancement to a Bishoprick  Difficultys and Discouragements  not withstanding I wish'd without prescribing to the Wisdom of the Government in the choice of a learned Prelate that the great Mr  Grounds  for the good of the Church too might be soon consecrated And I should not have despair'd of it but that he's a Gentleman of real Probity and Conscience and might possibly boggle at Subscriptions unless you and Bishop  Hoadly  could help him to some of your  Reserves  and  Distinctions  wherewith you must be both well Stock'd to overcome that  Difficulty  And why should not  Dean Swift  for his Writings as well as some others be made a Bishop I should like to see him one if the  then  Right Reverend Bishop  Grounds  would not think him for his  Tale of a Tub  too loose in the Faith for his Company  Don't imagine  My Lord  that I am forming of Schemes for my self to be a Bishop Tho these my  Discourses  on  Miracles  are of very great Merit as well as your Lordship's  Difficulties  c yet you may be assured I have no such View when I tell you that the Honour the Fathers have exalted me to of a  Moderator  in this Controversy  sets me above all Ecclesiastical Preferment excepting the  ArchBishoprick  of  Canterbury  which I'm afraid will be void before the King is apprised of my singular Worth and Qualifications for it  But however if such excellent  Prelates  as  Grounds    Hoadly    Swift    Hare  and  my self  were at the Head of Ecclesiastical Affairs what would we do What should we not do What would not this freethinking Age expect from us Nothing less than that according to our Principles we should endeavour to set Mankind at perfect Liberty and to lay open the dirty Fences of the Church call'd Subscriptions which are not only the Stain of a good Conscience but the  Discouragements  your  Lordship  hints at in the Study of the Scriptures And if we made a Push for an Act of P  t to turn the  Clergy  to Grass after King  Henry  VIIIth's Monks and Fryars where would be the Harm of it Nay the Advantage to the Publick as well as to Religion  would be great if their Revenues were apply'd to the Payment of National Debts with a Reserve to our selves remember  My Lord  of large Emoluments out of them according to our great Merits otherwise worldlywise Men will repute us impolitick Fools which you and Bishop  Hoadly  I humbly presume will never endure the Reproach of  So hoping your Lordship will accept of this Dedication to your Praise in as much Sincerity as it is written I subscribe myself  My LORD  The Admirer of your Difficultys and Discouragements  Tho Woolston  London  May    A FOURTH DISCOURSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR  c  _NOW for a  fourth  Discourse on  Jesus  's Miracles which as before I begin with a Repetition of the three general Heads at first proposed to be treated on and they are  I To show that the Miracles of healing all manner of bodily Diseases which  Jesus  was famed for are none of the proper Miracles of the  Messiah  neither are they so much as a good Proof of his divine Authority to found a Religion  II To prove that the literal History of many of the Miracles of  Jesus  as recorded by the  Evangelists  does imply Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities consequently they either in the whole or in part were never wrought as it is commonly believed nowadays but are only related as prophetical and parabolical Narratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  III To consider what  Jesus  means when he appeals to his Miracles as to a Testimony and Witness of his divine Power and to show that he could not properly and ultimately refer to those he then wrought in the  Flesh  but to the mystical ones he would do in the Spirit of which those wrought in the Flesh are but mere Types and Shadows  I am upon the second of these Heads and according to it have in my  former Discourses  taken into examination  eight  of the Miracles of  Jesus    viz  those  Of his driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple  Of his exorcising the  Devils  out of the Madmen and sending them into the Herd of Swine  Of his Transfiguration on the Mount  Of his healing a Woman that had an Issue of Blood twelve Years  Of his curing a Woman that had a Spirit of Infirmity eighteen Years  Of his telling the  Samaritan  Woman her fortune of having had five Husbands and being then an Adulteress with another Man  Of his cursing the Figtree for not bearing Fruit out of season And  Of his healing a Man of an Infirmity at the Pool of  Bethesda  Whether it be not manifest that the Literal and Evangelical Story of these Miracles from what I have argu'd and reason'd upon them does not consist of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities according to the Proposition before us let my Readers judge and so I come to the Consideration of  A ninth Miracle of  Jesus    viz  that  John ix  of his giving sight to a Man who was  born blind by the means of Eyesalve made of Dirt and Spittle  Blindness as far as one may guess by the Evangelical History was the Distemper that  Jesus  frequently exercis'd his Power on And there is no doubt to be made but he heal'd many of one Weakness Defect and Imperfection or other in their Eyes but whether he wrought any Miracle upon any he is supposed to have cured is uncertain There are as it's notorious many kinds of Blindness that are incurable by Art or Nature and there are other kinds of it that Nature and Art will relieve a Man in But whether  Jesus  used his healing Power against the former as well as the latter sort of Blindness is more than can be affirm'd or at least proved by our  Divines  And unless we knew of a certainty that the sore or blind Eyes  Jesus  cured were absolutely out of the reach of Art and Nature  Infidels  will imagine and suggest that he was only Master of a good Ointment for sore Eyes and being successful in the use of it ignorant People would needs think he wrought Miracles  The World is often bless'd with excellent  Oculists  who thro' Study and Practice have attain'd to wonderful Skill in EyeMaladies which tho they are of various  sorts yet by Custom of Speech all pass under the general Name of  Blindness  And sometimes we hear of famous  ChanceDoctors  like  Jesus  who by a Gift of God Nature or Fortune without any Skill in the Structure of the Eyes have been very successful in the Cure of one Distemper or other incident to them Such was Sir  William Read  who tho no Scholar nor of acquir'd Abilities in  Physick  and  Surgery  yet cured his Thousands of sore or blind Eyes and many of them too to the surprise and astonishment of profess'd  Surgeons  and  Physicians  Whether He or  Jesus  cured the greater number of Blindness may be question'd To please our  Divines  it shall be granted that  Jesus  cured the greater Numbers but that he cured worse or more difficult Distempers in the Eyes can't be proved Sir  William  indeed met with many Cases of blind and sore Eyes that were out of the reach of his Power and so did  Jesus  too or he had never let great Multitudes of the blind and otherwise distemper'd People go unheal'd by him Our  Divines  will here say that it was never want of Power in  Jesus  but want of Faith in the diseased if he did not heal them but in other  Surgeons  and  Physicians  it is confessedly their own Insufficiency To which I have only this  Answer that our  Physicians  and  Surgeons  are to be commended for their Ingenuity to impute it to their own Defect of Power and not to lay the Blame upon their Patients when they can't cure them And it is lucky for us Christians that we have  this Salvo  for the Credit of  Jesus  's miraculously healing Power that it was not fit he should exert it against Unbelief otherwise reasonably speaking He with Sir  William Read    Greatrex    Vespasian  our former  Kings  of  England  and  SeventhSons  must have pass'd but for a  ChanceDoctor  But to come to the particular Consideration of the Miracle before us  Jesus  restored it seems a blind Man to his Eyesight by the use of a peculiar Ointment and washing of his Eyes as directed in the Pool of  Siloam  Where lies the Miracle I can't see it but hope our  Divines  will take their opportunity to point it out to me Our  Surgeons  with their Ointments and Washings can cure sore and blind Eyes of one sort or other and  Jesus  did no more here and yet he must be reckon'd a Worker of Miracles and they but artificial Operators where's the Sense and Reason of this difference between them If Mr  Moor  the  Apothecary  for the notable Cures he performs by the  means of his Medicines should write himself and be accounted by his Admirers a  Miracleworker  he and they would be but laugh'd at for it And yet  Jesus  for his curing the sore Eyes of a poor Man with an Ointment must be had in veneration for a divine and miraculous Operator as much as if by the breath of his Mouth he had removed an huge Mountain  A Miracle if I mistake not the Notion of our  Divines  about it is a supernatural Event or a Work out of the Power of Nature or Art to effect And when it is spoken of the Cure of a Disease as of Blindness or Lameness it ought to be so represented as that skilful and experienced  Surgeons  and  Physicians  who can do strange and surprizing Cures by Art may give it upon their Judgment that no Skill of Man could reach that Operation but that it ought to pass for the Work of a divine and almighty Hand and Power But there is no such care taken in the Description of any of the Diseases which  Jesus  cured much less of this before us against the miraculousness of which consequently there are these two Exceptions to be made  First  That we know nothing of the Nature of this poor Man's Blindness nor  what was the defect of his Eyes nor whether it was curable by Art or not Without which Knowledge it is impossible and unreasonable to assert that there was a Miracle wrought in the Cure of him If his blindness or weakness of Eyesight was curable by human means and Jesus did use those means there's an end of the Miracle If the  Evangelist  had given us an accurate Description of the Condition of this Man's Eyes before Cure we could have judg'd better But this is their constant neglect in all the Distempers  Jesus  heal'd and is enough to induce us to doubt of his miraculous Power There are as I have said some sorts of sore or blind Eyes curable by Art as Experience does testify and there are others incurable as  Physicians  and  Patients  do lament Of which sort this Man's was we know not The worst that we know of his Case is that he was blind from his Birth or Infancy which might be and yet Time Nature and Art may give relief to him As a Man advances in Years the diseases of Childhood and Youth wear off What we call the  King'sEvil  or an Inflamation in the Eyes in time will abate of its Malignity Nature will not only by degrees work the Cure itself but the seasonable help of a good  Oculist  will soon expedite  it tho in time of Infancy he could be of no use And who knows but this might be the Case of this blind Man whose Cure  Jesus  by his Art did only hasten and help forward However there are Grounds enough to suspect that it was not divine Power which heal'd this Man or  Jesus  had never prepared and order'd an  Ointment  and  Wash  for him  Should our  Divines  suppose or describe for the  Evangelist  a state of Blindness in this Man incurable by Art that would be begging the Question which no Unbeliever will grant But to please them I will yield without Enquiry into the Nature of this Man's Blindness that if  Jesus  had used no Medicines if with only a word of his Mouth he had cured the Man and he had instantaneously recover'd as the Word was spoken here would have been a real and great Miracle let the Blindness or Imperfection of the Man's Sight before be of what kind or degree soever But  Jesus  's use of Washings and Ointments absolutely spoils and destroys the Credit of the Miracle and we ought by no means to ascribe  that  to the immediate Hand and Power of God which  Medicines  and  Balsams  are apply'd to the Effect of And this brings me to the  Second  Exception against the miraculousness of the Cure of this blind Man which is that  Jesus  used human means for the Cure of him which means whether they were at all proper and effectual in themselves do affect the Credit of the Miracle and give occasion of suspicion that it was Art and not divine Power that heal'd him or  Jesus  for his Honour had never had recourse to the use of them And what were those Means or that Medicine which  Jesus  made use of Why "He spit upon the Ground and made a Balsam of Dirt and Spittle and anointed the poor Man's Eyes with it and he recover'd" A strange and odd sort of an Ointment that I believe was never used before nor since for sore and blind Eyes I am not Student enough in  Physick  and  Surgery  to account for the natural and rational use of this Balsam but wish that skilful Professors of those Sciences would help me out at this difficulty If they could rationally account for the use of this Eyesalve tho it was by supposing that Jesus imperceptibly had in his Mouth a proper unctuous and balsamick Substance which he dissolv'd into Spittle they would do great service to a certain Cause and I wonder none of them  whether well or ill affected to Religion have as yet bent their Thoughts to it  In the Practice of  Physick  and  Surgery  there are sometimes very odd and unaccountable Medicaments made use of and nowandthen very whimsical and seemingly ridiculous ones by old Women to good Purpose But none of them are to be compared to  Jesus  's Balsam for sore Eyes I have heard of a merry  Mountebank  of Distinction whose catholick Medicine was  HastyPudding  which indeed is a notable Remedy against the  Esuriency  of the Stomach that the Poor often labour under But  Jesus  's EyeSalve for absurdity whim and incongruity was never equall'd either in jest or in earnest by any  QuackDoctor  Whether  Infidels  think of this Ointment of the Holy  Jesus  with a smile or reflect on it with disdain I can't guess As to myself I should think with St  Chrysostom  Quid Lutum illinere oportet hoc potius caecum reddere quis unquam hoc pacto curatus est  In Loc Johan  that this EyeSalve of  Jesus  would sooner put a Man's Eyes out than restore a blind one to his Sight And I believe that our  Divines  for the Credit of the Miracle and our  Surgeons  for the Honour of their Science will  agree that it could not be naturally operative and effective of the Cure of the blind Man  What then was the Reason of  Jesus  's using this strange EyeSalve when for the sake of the Miracle and for the honour of his own Power he should have cured the Man with a word speaking This is a Question and Objection in St  Cyril  Quam ob causam dicet aliquis cum omnia solo Verbo praestare possit nulloque negotio Lutum quidem sputo macerat  In Loc Johan  against Ministers of the Letter who are obliged to give an Answer to it that will consist with the Wisdom and Power of  Jesus  otherwise they must give up the Miracle or make him a vain insignificant and trifling Agent St  Cyril  of whose mind I am says  Sed Rationem quandam mysticam habet Vis Rei istius de sputo  Ibid  that the Reason of the use of this Balsam made of Dirt and Spittle is to be fetch'd from the Mystery But in as much as our  Divines  will never agree to that which would be of ill Consequence to their Ministry they must give a good Reason of their own which I despair of seeing that will comport with the Letter  St  Irenaeus  too says  Ei autem qui caecus fuerat a Nativitate jam non per sermonem sed per operationem praestitit visum non vanè neque prout evenit hoc faciens sed ut osteneret manum Dei eam quae ab initio plasmavit Hominem  c  Contra Haeres L v c  that the  Clay and Spittle  was of no service to the Cure of the blind Man and yet  Jesus  did not use it  in vain  Is not this an Inconsistency How will our  Divines  adjust it With  Irenaeus  I am sure they'll not mystically solve the Difficulty therefore if they don't provide another Solntion of it to satisfaction either their Ministry of the Letter or the Reputation of  Jesus  and this Miracle must suffer for it  I am puzzled to think how our  Divines  will extricate themselves out of this Strait and account for the use of this EyeSlave without any Diminution of the Miracle Surely they will not say that  Jesus  used this sensless and insignificant Ointment to put a  Slur  upon the Practice of  Physick  and  Surgery  as if other Medicines were of no more avail than his  Dirt  and  Spittle  They have more wit than to say so least it incense a noble and most useful Profession not so much against themselves as against  Jesus  and provoke them to a  nicer and stricter Enquiry than I can make into his Miracles the Diseases he cured and his manner of Operation and to infer from thence that he could be no miraculous Healer of Diseases who used Medicines nor his  Evangelists  orthodox at Theology who were so inexpert at Anatomy and the Description of bodily Distempers This might be of bad Consequence to Religion And yet I wonder that none of them who may be supposed a little disaffected to Christianity have taken the Hint from this pretended Miracle before us and some others to endeavour at a Proof of  Jesus  's being little better than a  QuackDoctor  If I was what I am not an  Infidel  I should think from the Letter of this Story that  Jesus  was a  juggling Impostor  who would pass for a miraculous Healer of Diseases tho he used underhand proper Medicines The  Clay and the Spittle  he made an open shew of as what to Admiration he would cure the blind Man with but in reserve he had a more sanative Balsam that he subtilly slip't in the room of the Clay and repeatedly to good purpose anointed the Man's Eyes with it But as the Authority of the Fathers and their mystical Interpretation of this Story is alone my  safeguard against such an ill opinion of  Jesus  so I would now gladly know upon what Bottom the Faith of our  Divines  can stand as to this Miracle and  Jesus  's divine Power in it  I have perused some of our  Commentators  on the Place and don't perceive that they hesitate at this strange EyeSalve nor make any Questions about the pertinent or impertinent Use of it Whether it is that they sleep over the Story or are aware of greater Difficultys in it than can be easily surmounted and therefore dare not touch on't I know not But now that we enjoy Liberty of Debate which will make us Philosophers and I have taken the Freedom to make a stricter Scrutiny than ordinary into  Jesus  's Miracles and to consider what absurditys their Storys and  this  in particular are clog'd with it is incumbent on our  Divines  to answer solidly these Questions  viz  What was the Reason of  Jesus  's Use of this EyeSalve made of Clay and Spittle Whether if it was of service to the Cure of the blind Man it does not destroy the Miracle And if it had no Effect in the Cure of him whether  Jesus  was not a  vain  and  trifling  Operator making use of insignificant and impertinent Medicines to the Diminution  of his divine Power These Questions are not ludicrous but  calm and sedate Reasoning  which  Bishop Smalbroke  See his Sermon before the Societys for Reformation  p    does not disapprove of Therefore a grave rational and substantial Answer is expected to them such as will be a Vindication of the Wisdom and Power of  Jesus  without any Diminution of the Miracle  Should our  Divines  say that this Matter was an Act of unsearchable Wisdom and must be left to the Will of our Saviour and not curiously pry'd into any more than some other Dispensations of Providence that are past finding out This Answer which I believe to be the best that can be given will not do here The Miracles of  Jesus  are as our  Divines  own Appeals to our Reason and Senses for his Authority and by our Reason and Senses they are to be try'd condemn'd or approved of If they will not abide the test of Reason and Sense they are to be rejected and  Jesus  's Authority along with them Therefore a more close pertinent and serious Answer is to be given to the said Questions which as I believe to  be impossible consistently with the Letter so our  Divines  must of necessity go along with me to the Fathers for a mystical and allegorical Interpretation of the Story of this EyeSalve or the Miracle will fall to the Ground and  Jesus  's divine Power be in great danger with it  St  Cyril  who is one of  Bishop Smalbroke  's Greek Commentators that should strictly adhere to the Letter signifies as I before observ'd that  Jesus  's Use of this Clay and Spittle would be an Absurdity if it was not to be accounted for from the Mystery  Eusebius Gallicanus  treating on this Miracle says  Ipse Salvator noster apertissime ostendit quod ejus Miracula aliquid significent dum ea faciendo alivuid agit quod Ratione carere videatur Nisi enim aliquid significaret quid necessarium fuit in hujus caeci Illuminatione ut Lutum faceret quo oculos ejus liniret cui solum dicere sufficiens erat Quaeramus igitur significationem videams quid caecus iste significet  In Homil quarta post quart  Dominicam  "that our Saviour apparently manifests that his Miracles are of a spiritual and mystical Signification because in the Work of them he does somewhat or other that literally has no Sense nor Reason in it As for Instance in the Cure of this blind Man what occassion was there  for  Clay and Spittle  to anoint his Eyes if it was not of a mystical meaning when with a Word of his Mouth  Jesus  could have cured him Let us then set aside the Letter of the Story and search for the Mystery and consider who is meant by this blind Man  c  "  Origen  too upon occasion of this Miracle and its Absurdity according to the Letter says  Similitudo erat Typus futurorum unumquodque quod fiebat in Corpore Veluti nescio quis à Nativitate caecus Visum recuperavit Vere autem caecus iste erat à Nativitate Gentilium Populus cui Salvator reddidit Vi  Saliva sua ungens oculos ejus mittens ad  Siloam  quod interpretatur missus mittebat quippe illos quos spiritu unxit ad Apostolos  In Isai  c vi  "that whatever  Jesus  did in the Flesh was but a Type and Figure of what he would do in Spirit as is apparent from the Miracle of his curing a blind Man which nobody knows why it was so done if it be not to be understood of a mystical Ointment to open the Eyes of the blind in Understanding"  And who then is this blind Man mystically St  Augustin  Genus humanum est iste caecus  In Loc Johan  St  Jerome  Caecus humanum Genus significatur  In Com Johan    Eusebius Gallicanus    Caecus iste a Nativitate Genus humanum esse videtur à primo homineHaec enim caecitas non Corporis sed Animae est  In Loc supra laudat  St  Theophilus  of  Antioch  Per caecum naturaliter non videntem illuminaeeum significat Genus humanum  In Loc Johan    Origen  Vere autem caecus iste erat à Nativitate Gentilium Populus  In Isai  c vi  St  Cyril  of  Alexandria  Caeci hujus Curationem in figuram typum vocationis Gentium accepimus  In Loc Johan  and St  Theophylact  Intellige hoc Miraculum spiritualiter Nam caecus quidem erat omnis homo à Nativitate id est ab Initio Mundi  In Loc Johan  Four of them  Bishop Smalbroke  's Greek and literal Commentators say this  blind Man  is a Type of Mankind of all Nations who in the Perfection of Time signified by the Sabbath  In Sabbato est figura ultimi Temporis  St Cyril in Loc Johan  in the Story is to be cured of this Blindness in Understanding  And what is Mankind's Blindness here signified St  Augustin  Caecitas est Infidelitas  In Loc  St  Cyril  Caecus qui destituitur divino Lumine  De Adorat  p  and St  Thyophylact  Caecus qui sedet in tenebris omnis Ignoranti  non potuit videre Conditorem Mundi  In Loc Johan  say it is Ignorance Error and Infidelity or the want of the intellectual Sight and Knowledge of  God and his Providence  Origen  Literam Legis sequentes in Errores Superstitiones Infidelitatem incurrunt  In Matt Tract  xxvi  St  John  of  Jerusalem  Caecus iste est caecus in Litera hoc statu Sa  ari non potest  In Marc  c viii  and St  Theophylact  Caeci qui imperiti Scripturarum  In Loc Johan  Still  Bishop Smalbroke  's literal and Greek Commentators tell us the Reason of this spiritual Blindness of Mankind and that is because they adhere to the Letter of the Scriptures  And how will  Jesus  or right  Reason  and  Truth  which are his mystical Names cure Mankind of this his spiritual Blindness By his mystical  Spittle  temper'd with mystical  Dirt  And how shall we do to understand this mystical Ointment so as to make it a proper Medicine for Mankind's spiritual Blindness St  Theophilus  of  Antioch  Lutum vero factum de Saliva oris Domini ac positum super oculos caeci significat hic quod naturae  rat opere suo implere Figulum  In Loc Johan  has an allegorical Interpretation of this  Clay  and  Spittle  of our Lord but as it is hard to apprehend his meaning I shall not here insist on it  Origen  says  Saliva sua ungens Oculos caeci mittens ad  am  quod interpretatur  Missus  mittebat quippe illos quos spiritu unxit c  In Isai c  vi  that the anointing of the blind Man's Eyes with  Spittle  is to be understood of the Unction of the  Spirit  of Christ But this does not give us rightly to understand the Metaphor and Figure St  John  of  Jerusalem  says that by the  Clay  and  Spittle  is meant  Saliva est perfecta Doctrina  In Marc  c viii  perfect Doctrine  which in Truth may open the Eyes of Mens Understanding But what is  perfect Doctrine  Why to help the Fathers out here without departing from their Opinions by the  Spittle  of Jesus must be understood the  Water  of the Spirit instill'd into the  Earth  of the Letter of the Scriptures which temper'd together does in the Judgment of them all make  perfect Doctrine  to the opening of the Eyes of our Understanding in the Knowledge of the Providence of God of all Ages which Knowledge Light Sight or Illumination Mankind has hitherto wanted  St  Irenaeus  Ei autem qui caecus fuerat à Nativitate jam non per sermonem sed per operationem praestitit Visum non vanè neque prout evenit hoc faciens sed ut ostenderet manum Dei eam que ab Initio plasmavit hominem Quapropter expuit in Terram fecit Lutum superlinivit illud Oculis ostendens antiquam Plasmationem quemadmodum facta est manum Dei manifestans his qui intelligere possunt per quam è Limo plasmatus est homo  Cont Hareses L  v  c    gives an excellent and mystical Reason by himself for the use  of this Ointment of  Clay  and  Spittle  to the Cure of this blind Man which I shall not stay to illustrate but only have cited it for the Meditation of the Learned and Curious  The Story of the blind Man as St  John  has related it is long and would take up more time than I have to spare at present to go thro' all the Parts of it What I have done at present is enough to awaken others to the Consideration not only of the Absurdities of the Letter but of the mystical Interpretation of the rest  The Miracle which consisted literally in the Cure of a blind Man by the use of an Ointment made of  Dirt  and  Spittle  is absurd sensless and unaccountable but in the Mystery there is Wisdom and Reason And the Cure of Mankind of the Blindness of his Understanding by the  Spirit  's being temper'd with the  Letter  of the Scriptures which is the mystical  EyeSalve  will not only be a most stupendous Miracle but a Proof of  Jesus  's  Messiahship  beyond all contradiction in as much as by such an opening of the Eyes of our Understandings which have been hitherto dark we shall see how he is the Accomplishment of the Law and the Prophets And so I pass to a  Tenth Miracle of Jesus  viz  John ii  That of his turning Water into Wine    at a Marriage in  Cana  of  Galilee This is call'd the beginning of  Jesus  's Miracles but whether it is to be understood of the  First  of his whole Life or of the  First  that he wrought in  Cana  of  Galilee  is not agreed amongst  Divines  I shall not enter into the Dispute which as it is of no Consequence to my Cause in hand so I shall pass it by and not urge any Arguments for or against either side of it  Tho I would not for the World be so impious and profane as to believe what is contain'd and imply'd in the Letter of this Story yet I am still too grave to handle it as ludicrously as I ought and it is now against the grain that I write so freely as I shall against it being unwilling not only to put the  Clergy  out of all Temper but to give  Scoffers  and  Infidels  so great an Advantage against their Ministry of the Letter Some may wonder that I who have gone so far in the ludicrous display of the gross Absurdities of some other Miracles should boggle at this But to be ingenuous and speak the Truth sincerely  I am still a Christian for all what the  Bishop  of St  David  's  See his Speech in Convocation printed in the  PostBoy  of  March  the th  Archdeacon Stubbs  and others would make of me upon the Principles of the Fathers and have a greater Veneration for the Person of the Holy  Jesus  than to be forward to make such sport with him his Mother and his Disciples as this Story affords Scope for And if it was not for the necessity of turning the  Clergy  's Heads to the Consideration of Mysterys this Miracle should have been pass'd by in silence  There were some antiently whom St  Chrysostom  Rursus hoc in loco calumniantur nonnulli hunc ebriosorum fuisse Conventum  c In Loc Johan  writes of whether  Jews    Gentiles  or  Hereticks  I know not who took great offence at the Story of this Wedding accounting it from what is related in St  John  as a riotous Feast and that  Jesus  and his Mother and his Disciples not only bore a part in the Revellings but were most to blame for them or he should not have countenanced them with his Presence much less promoted them by the Change of a large quantity of Water into Wine for the use of a Company who were already  drunk  with it But I with St  Chrysostom  am inclined to believe that if  Jesus  did grace this Wedding with his Presence there was no Excess encouraged or so much as suffer'd at it If he did accept of the Invitation of the Bridegroom it was for an opportunity not so much to turn  Water  into  Wine  as to make a proper Discourse to the People of conjugal Duties and as he was a searcher of the Hearts secretly to admonish the Married of the Sin and Mischief of Adultery tho we read not of a seasonable and good Word spoken at it  And the Empress  Eudocia  a nursing Mother of the Church has given us a Poetical and I hope a fictitious Description of this Wedding She makes a sumptuous and voluptuous Feast of it and writes  Pueri aut Saltatores volutabantur in his autem Tibiae Lyraeque Vocem habebant Mulieres autem Cantum accipientes volvebantur per medias Quaecunque optimatum erant uxores atque filiae Ill vero ad Saltationem desiderabilem Cantum Conversi delectabantur c In  HomeroCenton Empress  of  Musick  and  Dancing  in abundance enough to make us think of such Mirth and Pastime here as was unbecoming of a Company of Saints to be present at Whether it was that this  Empress  being only accustom'd to the Excesses of a Court could form no meaner Conceptions of a Country Wedding or whether she had any extrascriptural Authority for what she writ I know not But I believe that if  Jesus  was at all at a MarriageFeast the whole was conducted with Decency Order and Sobriety and if he there wrought any Miracle it was to manifest his Glory to the Conversion of some and Confirmation of the Faith of others  And our  Translators  of the  Bible  too have given occasion to suspect somewhat of Excess at this Wedding or they need not have made the Waterpots to hold two or three Firkins apiece If I had been the Translator they should not have held above two or three  Pints  apiece which Measure is as agreeable to the Original as  Firkin  neither can I imagine that  Jesus  if he did convert Water into Wine would do it in so large a Measure for fear of an intemperate abuse of it but only gave the Company a cast of his miraculous Power and a little taste of his Love and Goodwill to them  Such are the Conceptions that to the Honour of  Jesus  I am willing to form of this  Wedding  and wish that the  Letter of the Story did suggest no worse Thoughts of it to us I should be pleas'd if no  Infidel  really could what I but for the sake of the Mystery most unwillingly should write any ludicrous Descants on it But if this Story had been related of  Apollonius Tyanaeus  as it is of our  Jesus  I would have ridicul'd and satiriz'd it to the utmost of my Power and have render'd him and his Disciples of all Nations as contemptible as I could for the Belief of it and I don't doubt but our Christian  Priests  would have given me ample Praises and Commendations for so doing It is said of  Apollonius  that for the Entertainment of his Friends he commanded variety of nice Dishes of Meat together with Bowls of choicest Wine all on a sudden to descend upon his Table and range themselves in good Order Whether there was any Truth in this Miracle of  Apollonius  is not the Question but Mr  Chandler  Vindication of the Christian Religion  p  could see a Fault in it tho none in  Jesus  's Wine at this Wedding as if it was done for the Pleasure of luxurious Appetites tho we read of no Intemperance at it which can't be said of the  WeddingFeast  before us Our  Divines  I suppose no more than myself believe any thing of the said Miracle in  Apollonius  but if it was really wrought I fancy I could have lampoon'd him for it and would have made it a diabolical Work like that as Fables go of the Feastings of  Wizards  and  Witches  and our  Divines  passing by  Jesus  's  Wine  here would readily as they are Believers of the Storys of Witchcraft have struck in with me  But setting aside that miraculous Story of  Apollonius  which has but  one  Voucher the Case before us is  Jesus  's  turning Water into Wine  for the use of Men who had before  well drank  How shall I force Nature and Faith to ridicule this Story How shall I lay aside that profound Veneration for the Holy  Jesus  which Conversation with the Fathers more than the Prejudice of Education has begotten in me and ludicrously here treat him and his Miracle too as is incumbent upon me to make way for the Mystery In short I can't do it in my own Name but having met with a satirical Invective of a supposed Jewish  Rabbi  to this purpose I here publish it that our  Clergy  as well as myself may think of an Answer to it and so prevent that Mischief it may do by being  handed about among  Jews  and  Infidels  in Manuscript It is as follows  You Christians pay Adoration to  Jesus  whom you believe to be a divine Author of Religion sent of God for the Instruction Reformation and Salvation of Mankind and what induces you to this Belief of him is besides some obscure Prophecies which you can't agree upon and which neither your selves nor any body else understands the Application of the History of his Miracles But I wonder you should have a good opinion of him for his Miracles which if he wrought no better than what are recorded of him by your  Evangelists  are if duly consider'd enough to alienate your Hearts from him I can't spare time now to examine into all of them but according to the cursory Observation I have made on them there is not one so well circumstanced as to merit a considerate Man's belief that it was the Work of an omnipotent allwise just and good Agent Some of them are absurd Tales others foolish Facts others unjust Actions others ludicrous Pranks others jugling Tricks others magical Enchantments and if  many of them had been better and greater Operations than they are and of a more useful and stupendous nature than they seem to be yet the first Miracle that he wrought  viz  that of his  turning Water into Wine  at an extravagant and voluptuous Wedding at  Cana  of  Galilee  is enough to turn our Stomachs against all the rest It is in itself enough to beget in us an ill opinion of  Jesus  and to prepossess us with an aversion to his Religion without farther Examination into it It is enough to make us suspect his other Miracles of what name soever to be of a base magical and diabolical Extraction or he had never set up for a divine worker of Miracles with so ill a grace Would any sober grave serious and divine Person as you Christians suppose  Jesus  to have been have vouchsaf'd his Presence at a Wedding where such Levities Diversions and Excesses in our Nation of the  Jews  as well as in all others were indulg'd on such Occasions as were not fit to be seen much less countenanc'd by the  Saint  you would make of him If your  Jesus  his Mother and his Disciples had not been merry Folks in themselves they would  have declined the Invitation of the  Bridegroom  nay if they had been at all graver and more serious People than ordinary no Invitation had been given to such  SpoilSports  But boon Companions they were and of comimical Conversation or there had been at a Wedding no room for them You Christians may fancy what you please of  Jesus  and his Mother's Saintship but the very Text of the Story implies they were Lovers of good Fellowship and Excess too upon occasion or he had never upon her Intimation turn'd so large a quantity of Water into Wine after all or most of the Company were far gone with it You may suppose if you please that all were sober and none intoxicated and that the want of Wine proceeded from the abundance of Company rather than excess in drinking but why then did  John  the  Evangelist  use the word  which implies they were more than half seas over And if  Jesus  and his Mother had not both a mind to  top  them up the one would not have requested nor the other have granted a Miracle to that purpose Whether  Jesus  and his Mother themselves were at all  cut  as  were others of the Company is not so certain She might be an abstemious Dame for ought we know tho if old Stories are true of her familiarity with a  Soldier  of whom came her  chara Deûm Soboles  in all probability she would take a  Dram  and a  Bottle  too But it looks as if  Jesus  himself was a little  in  for't or he had never spoke so waspishly and snappishly to his Mother saying  Woman    what have I to do with thee mine Hour is not yet come  which was very unbecoming of a dutiful Son who excepting when he ran away from his Parents and put them to  Luke ii  Sorrow  and  Trouble  to look him up was and is still in Heaven say the  Roman Catholicks  a most obedient Child You modern Christians may put what Construction you can upon the words above of  Jesus  to his Mother to salve his Credit but the Fathers of your Church  Christus asperius respondit quid tibi mihi Mulier  St Chrysost in Loc Johan  Vide  Theophylact in Loc  confess them to be a sharp and surly Reply to her which if it did not proceed from the natural badness  of his Temper derived  ex traduce  from his supposed Father yet was certainly the effect of Drinking and that's the more likely because it is a  broken  and  witless  Sentence such as  Fuddlecaps  utter by halves when the  Wine's in  and the  Wit's out  Your modern  Commentators  are sadly puzzled to make good Sense of this broken and abrupt Sentence of  Jesus  and a pertinent Reply of it to what his Mother said to him  they have no Wine  If you will bear with me I'll help you out at this dead lift and give you the true meaning of it  thus Jesus  's Mother being apprised of a deficiency of Wine and willing as well as the  Bridegroom  that the Company should be thorowly merry before they parted intimates to her Son whom she knew to be initiated in the Mysterys of  Bacchus    that they had no Wine  But before she could finish her Request to him He mistaking her meaning imagines she was cautioning against drinking more Wine and exhorting him to go home whereupon he takes her up short and quick saying  Woman    what have you to do with me  for that too is the  English  of the  Greek  I'll not be interrupted  in my Cups nor break Company  for mine Hour is not yet come  to depart But after he rightly apprehended her he goes to work and rather than the Company should want their fill by trick of Art like a  Punchmaker  meliorates Water into what they call'd Wine That this is the obvious Interpretation and natural Paraphrase of the Words before us shall be try'd by the absurd Comments nowadays put upon them that are enough to make a considerate Man laugh if not hiss at them  Some antient Hereticks  Vide Sanctum Augustinum  In Loc Johan  very gravely infer'd from this Expression  Woman    what have I to do with thee  that  Mary  was neither a Virgin nor  Jesus  her Son or he had never accosted her with such blunt Language that implys they could not be so akin to each other This was a perplexity to St  Augustin  and gave him some trouble to explain the Expression consistently with her Virginity for all she cohabited with the old Carpenter and his Filiation But this being a quibble that has been long since dropt I shall not revive nor insist  on it But that the Expression above do's suppose a little Inebriation in  Jesus  I may averr neither is there a better Solution to be made of it  The Fathers of your Church being sensible of the absurdity abruptness impertinence pertness and senslesness of the Passage before us according to the Letter had recourse to a mystical and allegorical Interpretation as the only way to make it consistent with the Wisdom Sobriety and Duty of the Holy  Jesus  But you  Moderns  abandoning Allegories and Mysteries in Miracles have endeavour'd I say to put other Constructions upon it as may comport with the Letter and Credit of Jesus But how insipid and sensless they are I appeal to a reasonable Man who will give himself the trouble to consult them upon the Place and save me the pains of a tedious and nauseous Work to recount them for him  But to humour the Christian Priesthood at this Day I will suppose that  Jesus  and his Mother and Disciples tho Fishermen to have been all sober grave and serious at this Wedding suitably to the Opinion that their Followers  now would have us to entertain of them But then it is hard to conceive them less than Spectators and even Encouragers of Excess and Intemperance in others or  Jesus  after their more than sufficient drinking for the satisfaction of Nature had never turn'd Water into Wine nor would his Mother have requested him to do it if I say they had not a mind and took Pleasure in it too to see the Company quite  stitch'd up  A sober prudent and wise Philosopher or  Magician  in the place of  Jesus  if he had an Art or Power to turn Water into Wine would never have exercis'd it upon such an occasion no not to please his best Friends nor in obedience to the most indulgent Parent What would he have said in such a Case That the Company had drank sufficiently already and there was no need of more Wine The Bridegroom had kindly and plentifully entertain'd his Guests and he would not for the Honour of God who had endow'd him with a divine Power be at the Expence of a Miracle to promote the least Intemperance Whether such a Speech and Resolution in  Jesus  upon this occasion  would not have been more commendable than what he did let any one judge  If I was a Christian I would for the Honour of  Jesus  renounce this Miracle and not magnify and extol it as a divine and good Act as many nowadays do I would give into and contend for the Truth of  that Gloss  which the  Gentiles  of old  Apud St Chrysostomum  in Loc Johan  by way of Objection put upon it  viz That the Company having exhausted the Bridegroom's Stock of Wine and being in Expectation of more  Jesus  rather than the Bridegroom should be put to the Blush for deficiency palm'd a false Miracle by the help of the Governour of the Feast upon a drunken Crew    that is having some spirituous Liquors at hand mingled them with a quantity of Water which the Governour of the Feast vouch'd to be incomparable good Wine miraculously made by  Jesus  and the Company being thro' a vitiated Palate uncapable of distinguishing better from worse and of discovering the Fraud admired the Wine and the Miracle    and applauded  Jesus  for it and perhaps  became his Disciples upon it  If I I say was a Disciple of  Jesus  I would give this Story such an old turn for his Credit And I appeal to indifferent Judges whether such a daubing of the Miracle to remove the Offence of  Infidels  at this Day would not be politically and wisely done of me Whether modern Christians may be brought into such a Notion of this supposed Miracle I know not but really there is room enough to suspect such a Fraud in it  But supposing  Jesus  's Change of Water into Wine to have been a real Miracle none commission'd of God for the Reformation and Instruction of Mankind would ever have done it here Miracles as Mr  Chandler  Vindication of the Christian Religion  p  says excellently well  must be such things as that it is consistent with the Perfections of God  to interest himself in and again  they must argue not only the Power of God but his Love to Mankind and his Inclination to do them good  which this of  Jesus  is so far from that it has an an evil Aspect and Tendency as is above represented consequently it is  to be rejected and no longer esteem'd a divine Miracle neither is  Jesus  to be received as a Revealer of God's Will for it as Mr  Chandler  will bear me witness  No doubt on't but you Christian Priests would have us  Jews  and  Infidels  to believe the whole Company at this Wedding for all what is intimated by St  John  to the contrary to consist of sober and demure Saints I will suppose so but then what occasion had they at all for Wine What reason could there be for God's Power to interpose and make it especially in so large a quantity for them I can conceive none If any of the Company had been taken with fainting Fits and  Jesus  for want of a Cordial Bottle had created a chearing Dram or two I could not have found fault with it tho even here if he had restored the  Patient  with a word of his Mouth it had been a better Miracle than making of Wine for him But that he should make for a Company of Sots a large quantity of Wine of no less than twelve or eighteen Firkins of  English  Measure enough to intoxicate the whole Town of  Cana  of  Galilee  is  what can never be accounted for by a Christian who should one would think wish this Story for the Reputation of  Jesus  expunged out of the New Testament  Besides if  Jesus  had really and miraculously made Wine which no Power or Art of Man could do he should to prevent all suspicion of deceit in the Miracle have done it without the use of Water You Christians say he is the original Cause of all Things out of Nothing why then did he not  Sed quanam gratia antequam implerentur non fecit Miraculum quod longè fuisset admirabilius Siquidem aliud est subjectae Materiae qualitatem mutare aliud ipsam substantiam ex nihilo facere  Chrysos in Loc  create this Wine out of nothing why did he not order the Pots to be emptied of their Water if there was any in them and then with a word of his Mouth command the filling them with Wine instead of it Here had been an unexceptionable Miracle which no  Infidels  could have cavil'd at for any thing but the  needlessness  of it But this subject Matter of Water spoils the Credit of the Miracle The WaterPots it seems are to be fill'd before  Jesus  could do  the notable Feat is not this enough to make us think that Jesus was but an artificial  Punchmaker  Could not he create Wine without Water for a Transmutation Yes you'll say he could what was the Reason then that he did not This is a reasonable Question to a learned Priesthood and a rational Answer should be given to it And a Question too it is that heretofore has been under debate Some said that the Water might be used to abate of the  Saepe obest Magnitudo ne Miracula creditu sint facilia  Theophylaect in Loc  immensity of the Miracle which otherwise for its greatness might have surpass'd all belief But this Reason will not do A Miracle can't be too great in itself if well attested to transcend Credit but it may easily be too little to conciliate the Faith of a FreeThinker The Fathers of your Church fetch'd a Reason for the use of Water here from the Mystery but since Mysterys on Miracles are set aside by the Priesthood of this Age they are to assign another and good Reason of their own or this Miracle is to be rejected as a piece of Art and Craft in the Operator  if for no other Reason than this that  Jesus  used Water to make Wine  All that I have to say more to this Miracle is that it is to be wish'd if Jesus could turn Water into Wine that he had imparted the Secret and Power to his Disciples of the  Priesthood  of all Ages since which would have been of greatest Advantage to them in this World He has empower'd them they say to remit Sins which few old Sinners think themselves the less in danger for And he has enabled them some say to transubstantiate Bread into Flesh and Wine into Blood which none but foolish and superstitious Folks believe they ever did And he promised to invest them with a Power to do greater Miracles than himself even to remove Mountains and to curse Trees but I thank God they never were of so strong a Faith as to put it in Practice or we might have heard of the  natural  state as well as we do now of the  civil  state of some Countrys ruin'd and overturn'd by them But this Power to transmute  Water into Wine  without Labour and Expence would have been of better worth to them than all their other Priestly Offices Not that our Conduits  would thereupon run with Wine instead of Water or that Wine would be cheaper and more plentiful than it is now excepting among themselves if they could withal curse Vineyards They would make the best Penny they could of their divine Power And as surely as they can now sell the Waterdrops of their Fingers at a Christening at a good Rate they would set a better Price on their miraculously made Wine and give a notable Reason for its dearness  viz  that Miracles should not be  cheap  which would bring them into Contempt and lessen the Wonder and Admiration of them  So ends the Invective of a suppos'd Jewish  Rabbi  against this Miracle which our  Divines  as well as myself are to consider of an Answer to Whether they shall think themselves able to answer the rational Parts of it consistently with the Letter I know not but I own myself unable and believe it impossible for them to do it And therefore they must of necessity go along with me to the mystical Interpretation of the Fathers or this Miracle will turn to the dishonour of  Jesus  and disadvantage of his Religion  Justin Martyr  In Dialog cum Tryphone  p    says it is absurd to take the Stories of the Marriages and Concubinages of the  Patriarchs  of the Old Testament in a literal Sense And indeed literally consider'd they are some of them too luscious Tales to be related by divine and inspired Penmen whereupon he as well as St  Paul  and  PhiloJudaeus  In Lib de Abrahamo  turn these Stories for the Honour of God and Edification of his Church into an Allegory Consequently if  Justin  had had an occasion to speak of this Marriage before us there's no doubt on't but he would have made Mystery of all and every Part of it  To the same purpose  Origen  In Matt Tract  xxii  says "That since the Law is a shadow of good Things to come and writes sometimes of Marriages and of Husbands and Wives we are not to understand it of Marriages according to the Flesh but of the spiritual Marriage between Christ and his Church As for Instance  Abraham  had two Sons  c  here we ought not to confine our Thoughts to carnal Marriages and their Offsprings but to extend them to the Mysteries  here signified And there are almost a thousand other places in Scripture about Marriages but in every place  unusquisque Locus castum divinum de Nuptiis continet Intellectum secundum Expositionem moralem  is to have a divine moral and mystical Construction put on't Whoever therefore reads the Scriptures about Marriages and understands no more by them than carnal Marriages he errs not knowing the Scriptures nor the Power of God" From hence may be easily concluded what was  Origen  's opinion about this Marriage in  Cana  of  Galilee  if there were no other Passages in him for a Confirmation of it But to come closer to the Purpose  St  Augustin  Aliquid enim in ipsis factis innuit nobis puto quia non sine causa venit ad Nuptias Excepto Miraculo aliquid in ipso facto Mysterii Sacramenti latet Pulsemus ut aperiet de Vino invisibili inebriet nos  In Loc Johan  says there is Mystery signified in the Story of this Marriage as in all  Jesus  's Miracles which it becomes us to open and search for till if possible we are  inebriated  with the spiritual and invisible Wine that  Jesus  made  at this Feast And again  Nihil dicemus quid sibi velint Hydriae quid Aqua in Vinum conversa quid Architriclinius quid Sponsus quid Mater Jesu in Mysterio quid ipsae Nuptiae  Ibid  says Let us then consider the several Particulars of the Story and what is meant by the six Waterpots and the Water that is turn'd into Wine and the Governor of the Feast and who are the Bridegroom and the Bride and who is the Mother of  Jesus  in a Mystery and what is to be understood by the Marriage  And again says St  Augustin  Per hoc invitatus Dominus venit ad Nuptias ut ostenderetur Sacramentam NuptiarumIllarum Nuptiarum Sponsus Personam Domini figurabat cui dictum est servasti bonum Vinum usque adhuc Bonum Vinum id est Evangelium servasti usque adhuc  Ibid  there is Mystery in this Marriage or  Jesus  upon no invitation had gone to it The Bridegroom is our Lord himself to whom it is said thou hast reserv'd the good Wine of the Gospel  until now  that is until the typified Time of the Celebration of this mystical Marriage which according to St  Augustin  Sex Hydriae sunt sex Aetates Temporum capientes Prophetiam pertinentem ad omnes gentes sive in duobus generibus hominum id est Judaeis Graecis sive in tribus propter Noe tres Filios  Ibid  is to be on the sixth Age of the World signified by the six WaterPots holding two or three Firkins apiece  that is all Mankind as they are divided into the  two  sorts of  Jews  and  Gentiles  or into  three  as they are descended of the  three  Sons of  Noah  And in another Place the same St  Augustin  interpreting this Story says  Vocatur Salvator ad Nuptias hoc est Ecclesiae voto spiritus sanctus invocaturVenit cum Discipulis suis id est in Loco sancto Turba sanctorum Mirabilia Dei Maria Mater expectat hoc est Virtutem Christi expectat EcclesiaMaria ait ecce Vina deficiant hoc est Vinum Spiritus Ecclesia optat excipereNumquid Mulierem dicit Jesu Mariam quae Virgo post Pactum inventa est Sed Ecclesiam alloquitur quae non solum Mulier sed meretrix nuncupatur  In Sermon  xcii  Append  thus "Our Saviour is invited to a Marriage what can that mean but that the Holy Spirit is courted and invocated by the Church wishing to be espoused to him  Jesus  comes with his Disciples that is into a holy Place of a Company of Saints  Mary  the Mother of our Lord signifies to him  that they have no Wine  so the Church makes known to him the Deficiency of the Spirit which she waits for the Power of And if  Jesus  calls  Mary  a Woman he means the Church who by Transfiguration may be a Virgin the Mother the Spouse of Christ and a Whore too"  And again St  Augustin  explaining  Vinum multis Locis accipimus Scripturas Sanctas meracissimum Vigorem coelestis sapientiae continentes quibus incalescant sensus inebrientur Affectus Ope+rante Christo in Cana Galileae Vinum defecit Vinum fit id est Umbra removetur Veritas praesentatur Recedit Lex Gratia succedit Carnalia spiritualibus commutantur Bonum quidem Vinum est vetu Testamentum sed sine spirituali Intellectu vanescit in Litera  In Sermon  xc  Append  Sed illud quod in Litera Legis aquam sapiebat dum spiritualiter intelligi fecit aquam in Vinum convertit  In Sermon  xci  Append  what is meant by the Water and the Wine that it wou'd be turn'd into at the Time of the spiritual Celebration of this Marriage of Christ with his Spouse of the Church says plainly enough that by  Water  is meant the Letter of the Scriptures and by the best  Wine  is to be understood spiritual Interpretations which would transport the understandings of Men with divine knowledge and warm their Hearts and Affections into a spiritual  Inebriation  after the similitude of Wine natural  St  Theophilus  of  Antioch  a most antient Greek Commentator who according to  Bishop Smalbroke  should strictly adhere to the Letter says  Per Nuptias Conjunctionem Christi Ecclesiae hoc est Veteris Novi Testamenti Traditionem debemus accipere Sponsus est Christus Architriclinius est Moses  In Loc Johan  that by this Marriage  is meant the Conjunction of Christ and his Church as it is the Tradition of the Old and New Testament And that  Jesus  himself is the Bridegroom and  Moses  the Governor of the Feast  Other Fathers such as St  Cyril  St  Theophylact  and St  Jerome  are of the same mind about the mystical Interpretation of this Marriage as might be prov'd by Passages out of them if I had room here to cite them But I must observe here that according to the Fathers the Story of this Marriage is but another Emblem of the Marriage of the Lamb with the Bride of the  New Jerusalem  spoken of in the  Revelations  to which all the Fowls of the Air will be invited that is spiritual and heavenly minded Christians who  Volucres Coeli sunt verè puri ad caelestis sapientiae Cognitionem evolare parati  Clem Alex Strom L  iv  soar and fly aloft in their divine and sublime Contemplations on the anagogical Sense of the Scriptures which will exhibit those intellectual Dainties they are there to be entertain'd with  What I have here said out of the Fathers to the Story of this Marriage is enough to quicken our  Divines  to search for the like mystical Interpretation of the whole The Part of it that's most  difficult to be spiritually expounded is that saying of  Jesus  to his Mother  Woman    what have I to do with thee mine Hour is not yet come  For the clear Interpretation of which I own I meet with little in the Fathers But St  Augustin  Quid mihi tibi est Mulier Procul dubio Fratres latet ibi aliquid Mysterii  In Loc Johan  assures us there's latent Mystery in the words How then shall we come at it Why if we cast away the  Interrogation  and look upon the Sentence as ellyptical like an infinite number of prophetical ones the Sense paraphrastically and agreeably to the rest of the Mystery arises thus In answer to the Woman of the Church's Expectation of the Wine of the Spirit  Jesus  will tell her or make her to understand of what importance it is to her and himself to be supply'd with that mystical Wine to her Edification which it was not his time to pour forth upon the Church till the Celebration of his Nuptials with her  And thus have I done with the Miracle of  Jesus  's turning Water into Wine at a Marriage of  Cana  of  Galilee  Whether it be not an absurd and offensive Story according to the Letter let any  one judge If the supposed Jewish  Rabbi  has forced a worse Sense upon it than it will naturally bear our  Clergy  may expostulate with him for it which they hardly will any otherwise than by Exclamations against him without Reason and Authority But in the mystical Operation of this Miracle at the Marriage of Christ with his Church there will be the Wisdom and Power and Goodness of God visible And it will be a demonstration of  Jesus  's  Messiahship  in as much as the Water of the Letter of the Law and the Prophets can't be turn'd into the Wine of spiritual Interpretations but we must discern how he is the Accomplisher and Fulfiller of them And so I pass to an  Eleventh Miracle of Jesus  viz  Matt ix Mark ii Luke v  That of his healing a Paralytick for whom the Roof of the House was broken up to let him down into the Room where  Jesus  was  And this Story without excepting that of the Pool of  Bethesda  is the most monstrously absurd improbable and incredible of any according to the Letter There is not one Miracle of  Jesus  specifically related that does not labour under  more or less Absurdities either in Substance or Circumstance But this for number and greatness of Absurdities I think surpasses them all And the Absurdities of it too are so obvious and stare a Man in the Face that I wonder they are hitherto overlook'd and that considerate and intelligent Persons have not before now hesitated and boggled at them If Interest had not blinded the Eyes of our learned  Clergy  they would easily have descry'd the Incredibilities and Absurdities of this Story and in another  Impostor  's Case presently have pointed them out to the ridicule of his Admirers and Adorers  If a Man was to torture his Brains for the Invention of a romantick Tale of improbable and surprizing Circumstances that he might withal hope to palm for a Truth if it was but for a Week or a Day upon the Faith and Understanding of the Credulous he could never have presumed I think so far upon the weakness of their Intellects as to imagine any thing so grosly and notoriously contradictory to Sense and Reason would have gone down with them as is  this  before us which has pass'd currently thro' many Ages of the Church has been read with attention by the Learned and revered  by the rest of Christians without any exception hesitation or doubt of the Truth of it In short so palpable is the falsity of the Story of this Miracle that it requires no Sagacity to detect it and was it not for the sake of the Mystery more than to expose the Folly of the  Clergy  in believing of it I had never bestow'd the following Pains on it  The People it seems so press'd and throng'd about the Door of the House where  Jesus  was that the Paralytick and his Bearers could not get near it What did they so throng and press for Was it to see  Jesus  who was  without Form and Comeliness  according to the Prophet  Isaiah  or who was one of the most graceful of the Sons of Men as  Painters  and  Publius Lentulus  do describe him This could not be the Reason of the Croud Tho a Person extraordinary either for Beauty or Deformity may attract the Eyes of the People and occasion too a Throng about him yet this could be no Reason for a  Press  about  Jesus  at  Capernaum  where he dwelt and was commonly seen and well known  Was it then to hear him preach Nor this neither Tho an excellent Preacher does sometimes and a very indifferent one does oftener draw multitudes  after him yet  Jesus  as a Prophet was without Honour at  Capernaum  his own Country consequently it is not to be supposed that for his Doctrine he was so much follow'd here tho we read that he  preach'd the Word unto them  Was it then to behold him working of Miracles and curing of the diseased This is the likeliest Reason of the Crouds and Throng about him And perhaps it was a Day appointed beforehand for his healing of the diseased which might occasion a more than ordinary Concourse of the People But then this Reason would have induced the People to make way for the  Lame    Blind  and  Paralyticks  to come to  Jesus  or they frustrated their own Hopes and Expectations of seeing Miracles wrought and acted more unreasonably than ever Mob did or can be supposed to do  But whatever was the Reason of this tumultuous Crouding which is hard to be accounted for it's said the poor  Paralytick  with his Bearers could not get to the Door of the House for the  Press  and therefore in all haste is he haul'd to the Top of the House and let down thro' a breach of the Roof into the Room where  Jesus  was What need  was there of such haste and pains to get to  Jesus  for a Cure It was but waiting a while not many Hours and in all probability the Tumult would be appeas'd and access easily had to him But that the Bearers of the poor Man should enterprise a trouble and difficulty that could not require less Time than the Tumult could be supposed to last is a little strange and somewhat incredible  St  Chrysostom  says  Paralyticus repletum videret Theatrum Aditus interclusos Portum obseptumNon tamen dixit Propinquis suis quid hoc Rei est Expectemus quousvue Domus evacuetur Theatrum dimittatur recedent vui congregati sunt poterimus privatim ad illum accevere  In Homil de hoc Paralyt  that the  Paralytick  saw that the Marketplace or Street was throng'd with People who had obstructed all Passage to the House where  Jesus  was and yet he did not so much as say to his Friends and Bearers "What's the Reason of this Tumult Let's stay till it is appeas'd and the House clear'd of the People who ere long will depart and then we shall privately and quietly get admittance to Jesus" But why did he not say so Any one beside himself and his Bearers if they had any Reason and  Senses about them would have so argued St  Chrysostom  says it was their  Faith  that made them in such haste to get to  Jesus  But I should have thought their  Faith  might have work'd  Patience  and disposed them to stay till Jesus could come out to them or they get in to him And it is an Addition to the strangeness and incredibility of the Story that it did not  But supposing this  Paralytick  in such haste and danger of Life that he could not wait the dispersion of the Tumult but for want of a free entrance at the Door is cost what it will to be rais'd to the top of the House and a breach must be there made for him The Question is whether such an Enterprize was or could be feisable and practicable I have no Conception of the possibility of it If they could not get to the Door of the House for the Press of consequence they could not come at the Sides of it How should they over the Heads of the People That's not to be imagined consequently here's another difficulty in the Story that renders it yet more strange and incredible  But without questioning the possibility and easiness of getting the  Parlytick  and his Couch over the Heads of  the Mob to the sides of the House thither he is brought where we now behold him and his Bearers with their Pullies Ropes and Ladders that were not at hand nor could suddenly be procured hauling and heaving him to the top of the House Of what height the House was is not of much Consequence Some for the Credit of the Story may say  Dicet aliquis valde dimissum fuisse Locum à quo per Tegulas deposuerunt Paralytici Lectum  Johan Nepot Hieros in Loc Luc  it was a  very low one  tho antient and modern  Commentators  are pretty well agreed that it was an  upperRoom  where  Jesus  was consequently the House was at least two Stories high But if it was much higher I'll allow that Art and Pullies which they wanted for the present would raise the Man and his Bed to the top of it So we will not dispute nor differ upon that matter On the top of the House then we are now to behold the  Paralytick  and his Bearers with their Hatchets and Hammers  c  which they forgot to bring with them for they could not think of any use they should have of them uncovering the Roof of the House breaking up  Tiles    Spars  and  Rafters  and making a Hole capacious enough for the Man and  his Bed to be let through An odd strange and unaccountable Work  this  which if they had not been cunning Fellows would hardly have enter'd into their Heads to project But at work they are when it was well if Jesus and his Disciples escaped with a only broken Pate by the falling of Tiles  c  and if the rest were not almost smother'd with the Dust for it was over their Heads that the breach was made Where was the good Man of the House all this while Would he suffer his House to be thus broken up and not command them to desist from their foolish and needless Attempt till the Mob was quell'd and there was a free entrance at the Door of his House which could not be long first Is there nothing in all this of difficulty and obstruction in the way of the belief of this Story  Some modern  Commentators  being aware of these difficulties in this Story and willing to reconcile Men to the easier belief of it say as  Drusius  Judaeorum Tecta plana erant non in Coni formam fastigiata  In Loc Luc  did that the Houses of  Judaea  were  flatroof'd    and not ridg'd  And Doctors  Lightfoot  and  Whitby  In Loc Marci  say there was  a Door on their flat Roofs by which the  Jews  used to ascend to the top of their Houses where they discours'd on the Law and religious Matters and that it was thro' such a Door by a little widening of the sides of it that the  Paralytick  was let down in the presence of  Jesus  To which Opinion I would yield if it was not liable to these Objections  viz  that it is not reconcilable to what St  Luke  says of  their letting the Paralytick down thro' the Tiling with his Couch in the midst where Jesus was  nor hardly consistent with what St  Mark  says of their  uncovering  and  breaking up the Roof of the House  which Expressions the  Evangelists  had never used if there had been a Door for him to descend by But to indulge  Lightfoot  and  Whitby  in their Notion I may ask them what occasion was there then of widening the doorway and breaking down the sides of it They'll say because the Passage otherwise was too narrow for the Man's Couch to get thro' Why then did not they take him out of his Couch and let him down in a Blanket a Chair or a Basket Or rather why did not  Jesus  to prevent this Trouble and Damage to the House ascend thro' this Door to the Top of it and there speak the healing  Word to this poor Man To say that  Jesus  could not or would not go up to the Paralytick I would not for Fear of an Imputation of Blasphemy against me Our  Divines  therefore are to look for what they'll hardly find an Answer to the said Question which will consist with the Wisdom the Goodness and Honour of  Jesus  or here will be another and insuperable Bar to the Credibility of this Story  In short there are more and greater Difficultys affecting the Credit of this Miracle on the side of  Jesus  than any before urg'd Could not he as it was antiently  Numquid enim facilem illi potuit Accessum reddere  Apud Chrysostom de hoc Paralyt  objected have made the Access to himself more easy Could not he to prevent all this Trouble and Pains of getting to the Top of the House and of breaking up the Roof of it have desired or even forc'd the People to make way for this poor Man and his Bearers This was not impossible for him to do If it was hard for another it was not for him who was omnipotent He that could drive his Thousands before him out of the Temple and draw as many after him into the Wilderness might surely by Force or Persuasion  have made the People how unreatonably mobbish soever to retreat And shy did he not Without a good and satisfactory Answer which I can't conceive to this Question here is the most unaccountable and incredible part of the whole Story that reflects on the Wisdom the Power and Goodness of  Jesus  If there had been no other absurd Circumstances of it this is enough to spoil its Credit so far as that I believe it impossible for  Ministers  of the  Letter  with all their Wit Penetration and Sagacity to get over it  Believe then the Story of this Miracle thus taken to Pieces who can It is such an Accumulation of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities that a Man of the most easy Faith if he at all think can't digest It's not credible I said to suppose the People of  Capernaum  where  Jesus  dwelt and was well known and little admired would at all  press  to see or hear him And if the occasion of their Concourse was to behold his Miracles it is less reasonable to think they would tumultuate to their own disappointment but rather make way for the diseased for the satisfaction of their own Curiosity to come to him And if they did mob it to their own disappointment about the  Door of the House it was next to impossible for the poor Man and his Couch to be heav'd over their Heads and rais'd to the top of it More unreasonable yet to think the Master of the House would suffer the Roof of it to be so broken up But most of all against Reason to suppose  Jesus  would not give forth the healing word and prevent all this Labour or by his divine Power disperse the People that the  Paralytick  might have present and easy access to him  Whether all this be not absolutely shocking of the Credit of this Story let my Readers judge In my Opinion no Tale more monstrously romantick can be told I don't here question  Jesus  's Power to heal this Paralytick nor the miraculousness of the Cure of him The trouble of that Question is saved me by the many other incredible Circumstances of the Story which are such a Contradiction to Sense and Reason as is not to be equall'd in any thing that's commonly receiv'd and believ'd by Mankind  Cicero  says that there is nothing so absurd which some of the Philosophers have not held And they might and did some of them hold gross Absurdities But the Letter of the Story of this Miracle before us which is the Object of the Faith  of our learned Priesthood at this Day a is match for the worst of them  But as absurd as this Story is I expect that our  Clergy  will be disgusted at my ludicrous display of it and that ArchDeacon  Stubbs  in particular will again be ready to exclaim against me and say that this is turning a  miraculous Fact  and a  divine Testimony  of our Religion into Ridicule Whereupon it is to be wish'd  that ArchDeacon  would write what would be a Pleasure to see a Vindication of this Story If he can account for the possibility and credibility of the Letter of it he shall have my leave to make another dull Speech in  Convocation  against me And it is not unlikely but he may say as much for it as another Man For as the Story is senseless so it is the better suited to his Head and Brains But if he don't I much question whether any other Clergyman of more Wit will appear in Defence of it  So absurd is the Letter of this Story that for the Honour of  Jesus  and Credibility of his Gospel it is absolutely necessary to turn it into Allegory To the Fathers then let us go for their help in this Case If they did not read me a better Lecture upon this Miracle than do our  modern  Commentators  I should be almost tempted to renounce my Religion upon it But as they have rationally and rightly instructed me in its true meaning so I retain my Christian Faith and admire the Sublimity of the Mystery which I am now to give an account of  By this  Paralytick  St  Hilary  In Paralytico Gentium universitas offertur medenda  In Loc Matt  says is to be understood  Mankind  of all Nations which opinion too the Fathers held of the  Paralytick  who was heal'd at the Pool of  Bethesda  And by his Palsy is not meant any bodily Distemper but the spiritual Palsy of the Soul that is as St  Augustin  Paralyticus potest intelligi Anima dissoluta Membris id est bonis operibus  Inter Quaest Evang  and St  Jerome  Paralysis Typus est Torporis quo piger jacet in Malitia Carnis habens desiderium Salutis Torporis Ignavia duplis Cogitationibus ac si enervatus Membris ostendit  In Loc Marci  interpret a dissoluteness of Morals and an unsteadiness of Faith and Principles which is the Condition of Mankind at present who want  Jesus  's help for the Cure of it  Eusebius Gallicanus  In hoc enim quod ait remittuntur tibi Peccata interiorem hominem id est spiritum paryliticum esse demonstrat Hoc enim non dixisset si ad Corporis Infirmitatem respexisset Non ideo Corpus sanatur quia Anima à peccatis liberatur  In Homil in Dominic  xix  post Pentecost  says our Saviour's words signify  that it is not a bodily but a spiritual Disease here meant or he had never said to the Paralytick  Son    thy Sins are forgiven thee  which words respect the inward Man and demonstrate the Palsy here to be a disease of the Soul  The Man sick of the Palsy had  four Bearers  And who are they mystically in this Case Why the Fathers  Sed qui sun  isti quatuor qui hunc Paralyticum portant Domino offerunt Per hos enim nescio qui melius quam quatuor Evangelistae intelligi possunt Nulla enim Anima nisi per istos Domino offertur nulla Anima nisi per istorum fidem sanatur  Euseb Gallican ibid  Sum Paralyticus quia non operantur immobiles sunt Vires Animae meae ad bonum sed si a quatuor Evangelistis gestatus adductus fuero ad Dominum tunc audiam remittuntur Peecata  Theophylact in Loc Marci  understand by them the  four Evangelists  on whose Faith and Doctrine Mankind is to be carry'd unto Christ for no Soul can be brought unto him for the Sanation of his Sins and Errors but by these  four  But to the top of the House is Mankind thus paralytically diseased to be carry'd by the four Evangelists his Bearers And what then is this House and its Top The House of  Jesus  is the intellectual Edifice of the World otherwise call'd Wisdom's House of the beautiful Buildings of which the Scriptures prophetically  treat therefore to the  sublime Sense  of the Scriptures call'd the Top  Tectum Domus qua Christus docet ascendendum id est Sacrae Scripturae Sublimitas est appetenda  Bedae in Loc Lucae  of the House is Man to be taken He is not to abide in the  low and literal Sense  Non utique in Infimis exterius qua turbae tumultuantur remanendum sed Tectum Domus c  Ibid  of them where People  press  and strive in vain to come to  Jesus  But if he is taken to the Sublimity of the Scriptures and there  open  Patefacto Tecto aeger ad Jesum summittitur quia reseratis Scripturarum Mysteriis ad Notitiam Christi pervenitur  Bedae in Loc Marci  Est Paralysis interior ut pervenias ad Christum forte enim latet Medicus intus est hoc est iste verus Intellectus in Scripturis occultus est exponendo quod occultum est aperi Tectum depone Paryliticum  Augustin in Serm  XLVI  Sect  Impediri turbis nisi Tecta id est operta Scripturarum aperiat ut per haec ad Notitiam Christi perveniat  Ejusdam in Quaest    ta in Evangel Lucae  the House  of Wisdom he will presently be admitted to the Presence and Knowledge of  Jesus  Venerable  Bede  who is altogether a a Transcriber of the Fathers for which Reason I cite him among the Fathers says  Et bene Domus Jesu juxta alterius Evangelistae Narrationem tegulis esse contecta reperitur quia sub contemptibili Literarum Velamine si adsit qui reseret divina spiritualis Gratiae Virtus invenietur Denudatio etenim Tegularum in Domo Jesu Apertio est in utilitate Literae sensus spiritualis arcanorum coelestium  In Loc Marci  that by the  Tiles  of the House  spoken of in St  Luke  is meant the  Letter  of the Scriptures which is to be laid open for the manifestation of Christ and of divine Mysteries to the healing of Man's spiritual Palsy the unsteadiness and dissoluteness of his Morals and Principles  So much in short then to the mystical Interpretation of the Story of this Miracle The literal Sense of it is so encumber'd with romantick Circumstances as are enough to turn a Man's Heart against Christianity it self But in the Mystery there will be a most stupendous Miracle which will be not only an Argument of  Jesus  's divine Power but of his  Messiahship  as certainly as his House of Wisdom of which the Scriptures write is open'd to the Manifestation of his Presence and to the Cure of Mankind of his paralytical Disease call'd an instability of Faith and Principles  And thus have I in this  Discourse  taken into Examination three more of  Jesus  's Miracles which I submit to the Judgment of my Readers whether the literal Story of them does not consist of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilites according to the Proposition before us and whether there is not a necessity for the Honour of  Jesus  to  turn them into prophetical and parabolical Narratives of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  My next  Discourse  if my mind hold shall treat on the three Stories of  Jesus  's raising of the dead  viz  of the Widow of  Naim  's Son of  Jairus  's Daughter and of  Lazarus  after which I will give the literal History of Christ's Resurrection that sandy Foundation of the Church a Review and so conclude my Discourses on the Miracles of our Saviour  To run thro' all the Miracles of  Jesus  and handle them in the manner I have done the foregoing would be a long and tedious Work But if our  Divines  shall think I have selected only those Miracles which are obnoxious to Cavil and Ridicule and have omitted others that literally are a more unexceptionable Testimony of  Jesus  's divine Power and Authority I will for their Satisfaction take more of them to Task and give the Letter of their Stories the like ludicrous treatment If I mistake not the Miracles already spoken to together with those of  Jesus  's raising of the dead and of his own Resurrection are the most famous and remarkable of any others And according to the Observation I have  made on the rest they are no less but rather more liable to Ridicule and Exception But if any are of a contrary Opinion and will let me know which in their Judgment are more unexceptionable Miracles I will vouchsafe them an Examination I am sure there is not one Miracle which the Fathers of the Church did not turn into Allegory and if we don't at this Day make mystical Operations of them they will none of them according to the Letter stand their Ground nor abide the Test of a critical Inquiry into them  I don't expect that this  Discourse  will be any more pleasing and acceptable to the  Clergy  who are  Ministers  of the  Letter  of  Jesus  's Miracles as well as of the Prophecies of him than any of my former But their Displeasure in the Case will give me no Disturbance nor am I concern'd about any Resentment they can make of it If they are offended at these  Discourses  they should as they came forth have written solid Confutations of them and so have prevented my Publication of any more of this kind But instead of serious and potent Reasonings against me I have met with little else but oral Railings Exclamations Defamations and attempts for Prosecution  which have been so far from terrifying me that they give me a secret Pleasure and animate me to proceed in the Undertaking in hand  I did not much question but the  Bishop  of St  Davids  whom I look'd upon as a Person of Ingenuity and Learning would before this Time have publish'd somewhat in Confutation of one or other of my former  Discourses  Whether he was not obliged to it or to make me some publick Reparation of the Injury done to my Reputation by his slanderous Sermon I appeal now to the worshipful  Societys  for Reformation of Manners to whom and to other Civil Magistrates I hope his Sermon without Reason will be a Caution that no PulpitInvective move them to prosecute or think the worse of any Author  Liberty of thinking writing and judging for our selves in Religion is a natural a Christian and a protestant  Right  It is a  Right  that the Magistrate as well as the Subject are interested in and are to see to the Conservation of or their Understandings as well as their Purses will be ridden and oppress'd by an ignorant and tyrannical Priesthood I urge not this for my own security against Prosecution for Infidelity and Blasphemy declaring  that if the  Bishops  of  London  St  Davids  or  ArchDeacon Stubbs  who are zealous for Persecution will but engage me on the Stage of Controversy and make good their Accusations against me I will submit to the worst Punishment that can be inflicted on the worst Offender  In the mean time I will go on with my Undertaking to the advancement of Truth and demonstration of the  Messiahship  of the Holy  Jesus  to whom be Glory for ever  Amen  FINIS  BOOKS written by Mr  WOOLSTON  and sold by him next Door
