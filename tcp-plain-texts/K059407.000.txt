 THE CASE Fairly Stated between the  TURKY  Company AND THE  Italian  Merchants  By a MERCHANT  LONDON  Printed in the Year  THE CASE Fairly Stated between the  TURKY  Company AND THE  Italian  Merchants  _THE  Turky  Company wou'd be but ill Charg'd with so much Art in the Conduct of their Trade if they were capable of using no Art in the Defence of it  No Man can charge them with want of Cunning in what they now push at  and had they us'd as much Honesty in their Argument as they shew Art in their Design some plain Questions and Answers wou'd bring us all to the End of the Dispute and the House of Lords had not had the Trouble of this Act  The Papers they have hitherto publish'd have generally aim'd at two Things and both of them seem to be unfair and something sophistical I am loth to call it Shuffling with respect to the Persons of the Gentlemen concern'd but Necessity obliges me to say That what they offer evidently looks one Way but means another the specious Pretences they make for the publick Good of Trade Encouragement of Manufactures and the like are only Covers to conceal the grand End of separate Interest which 'tis manifest is the Thing they aim at  They pretend in their Papers to advocate for the Good of their Country against the Encouragement given by the  Italian  Merchant to the  French  to sell their  Cloth in  Turky  by taking off the Raw Silk which is the Return whereas really they are in their Capacity as a Company the Reason of all the Encouragement the  French  meet with in the  Turky  Trade and if it were not for the ill Conduct of the  Turky  Company the  French  wou'd have no Silk to sell nor vend any Cloth in  Turky  worth naming  They pretend that the supporting the  Turky  Company is the Interest of the Trade whereas their being a Company in the Sense of their present Management is the great Obstruction of the Trade and will if not restrain'd be the Ruin of it  In their Papers therefore it is evident they aim at suppressing the  Italian  Merchant's Trade to  Turky  and at engrossing the Trade of selling Cloth in  Turky  and of Silk in  England  in order to imposing their own Price upon the Buyers of Cloth Abroad and the Manufacturers of Silk at Home Both which would if  obtain'd effectually declare them a Monopoly in the grossest Sense of that Word  Their Oppressions Abroad their unfair Dealings with the Merchants who from  Leghorn  interfere as they call it with their Trade their ByLaws their arbitrary Proceedings upon them and all the rest of their ill Conduct they give up and seem to plead Guilty to them all so they can but get this Bill  With so much Eagerness they push for this Bill that they not only manag'd their Introduction into it with the utmost Art and push'd it on with unweary'd Application to hinder their Books being look'd into but they said they were willing to consent to any future Laws to limit nay even to punish their Exorbitance so they may but be indulg'd with the Advantages they drive at in this Bill  In a Word they were in such a Passion for this darling Bill that they are willing to give up their Reputation as a Company submit to all the Parliament may think fit to do with them or all the Punishment that may be inflicted upon them provided they may but save THIS BILL  It is their own Expression in one of their Cases  Possibly the  Turky  Company may have committed Faults and made unfitting ByLaws If they have done both yet  THIS BILL  may be necessary  And in another Place  All that can be objected against the  Turky Company  may be remedy'd by a  BILL  in another Parliament and they may take  ANOTHER TIME  for the remedying of it If a Company oppresses the Parliament may curb and restrain it by  FUTURE LAWS And the like  I wou'd not treat the Company with Indecency but this seems to me to be little more than that of a Man detected of a grievous Trespass craving Leave for an immediate Power to oppress and injure his Neighbour and putting off the Examination and Punishment of his own Crime to another Season as if the remedying the Grievance on one side had not the same Justice in it and did not call for the same Concern of the Publick to rectify as the other I might have illustrated this by a more severe Simily if I were willing to carry Things to the heighth  But let us take these Gentlemen in their own Way and use their own Words as above  Possibly the Company have committed Faults and made unfitting ByLaws  It is most certain they have and I inter what I believe every one will grant  viz  Therefore it is not reasonable those that have already abus'd their Power shou'd be now enabled to abuse it farther And I humbly hope that the Nature of the Companies ByLaws and Orders may be inspected  What they now ask is neither more or less than to have a Power granted them to oppress and injure the Traders to  Turky  by way of  Italy  who they grant already they have injur'd and oppress'd As to the Bill they demand the Nature of it shall presently appear when the Fraud of the Design is more effectually laid open Something extraordinary must sure be the Case that these Men are so very earnest to have the Examination of the Conduct of the  Turky  Company put off it is a shrewd Suspicion of Guilt when Men are so extraordinary shy of coming to an Examination see how it runs thro' all their Arguings  If the Bill passes  say they again  the Conduct of the  Turky Company  all their  ByLaws  and  even their  Charter  if lyable to any just Exceptions may be examin'd afterwards by Parliament  Very good and why not now Why must not the Parliament be allow'd to examine Now into their Conduct their ByLaws their Oppressions their arbitrary Proceedings and their Charter if lyable to Exceptions as there is some Reason to believe they all are  Nor is the examining into these Things so incongruous to the Bill depending as they would insinuate I alledge and undertake to make it appear that the Bill they seek cannot be rational if the other Conduct of the Company is fully examin'd into and therefore it is not at all unreasonable to demand that both be enter'd into together 'tis a great Mistake to say that the Conduct of the Company has no Relation to this Bill On the contrary if the Company have misbehav'd if they have oppress'd and injur'd the FairTraders if their byLaws are unjust and they are a real Monopoly and ablove all if they seek to be able to act as a Monopoly by Virtue of this Bill then 'tis absolutely necessary to examine their Conduct before this Bill should pass  As for Example  If this Bill in its Nature tends to making the Company a Monopoly if it is evident that in soliciting  this Bill  they aim at a Power to monopolize if it appears that  this Bill  if pass'd will put that Power into their Hands Then with humble Submission to the House it is absolutely necessary to examine into the Abuse of the Power they have and the Reason of the Power they seek and of their seeking it and all before this Bill be suffer'd to pass  And what can it be but this plain Dependance of these Things one upon another that makes these Men so backward to have their Conduct examin'd But that they are sensible that if the House should ransack their Behaviour and the Use they have made of the Powers and Privileges which they have been entrusted with they would see very good Reason to consider well of it before they entrusted them any farther  Nor is this an unjust or an unfair Reflection because we that are oppress'd by the Company and have Reason feelingly to mention the Abuse of the Powers they have been entrusted with have much  more Reason than other Men to conclude what Use they would make of it if farther Powers were committed to them as a Company  And here because I am necessarily to enter with Plainness and Freedom upon the Detecting a general Scheme of Fraud and Injustice which evidently seems to run thro' the whole Course of this Matter and that as above much less Honesty than Art shews itself in the earnest Solicitations which are and have been made for this Bill I must be allow'd to distinguish between the Gentlemen concern'd in their personal and private Capacities and in their Capacities as a Company  In their former Capacities I have nothing in the least to say here is no personal Satyr intended nor do I direct any Reflection in this Affair to this or that particular Man There are without Doubt many worthy and honourable Persons in the  Turky  Company  But their Conduct as a Company is another Thing and no Man's private Reputation is concern'd in it and yet  I must acknowledge my self to be of the same Mind which King  Charles  IId gave as his Opinion to a certain Lord Mayor of  London    viz  That it was not possible for a Man to act in a Society with the same Honesty and Jussice as in their separate and private Capacities but that all Societies and Companies were Tyrants and Oppressors by the Nature of the Thing  Having made these Postulata with the GentlemenMembers of the Company as private Persons I shall with the more Freedom speak to their Behaviour as a Company  I have mention'd how strange it is that these Gentlemen should be so very Earnest for this Bill and for its passing without enquring into their Conduct I shall now unravel this Mystery and lay it open to the World and when I have done so the Wonder will cease  The first Reason is because enquiring into their past Conduct will necessarily discover the True but conceal'd Design of  the Bill  It will discover the Reason for endeavouring to obtain it  It will discover the Consequences of it if obtain'd  That the Discovery of any or of all these Things would most effectually overthrow the Bill seems reasonable for me to conclude from the Knowledge I have of the certain Application of the House of Peers to detecting all clandestine Measures Projects and Attempts couch'd under the specious Pretence of Right Property Publick Good and the like by which the Subjects are frequently impos'd upon the Publick abus'd and private Persons injur'd  It will be impossible the House can see the exact Connection that there is between the former Conduct of that Company and the Attempt couch'd under the Cover of  this Bill  and not see how artfully they seek to protect their past ill Conduct by obtaining an Authority for worse and to support the Oppressions of their former Measures by enlarging them in those they should now get Power to act by  To bring this Home to the Point in Discute that is to say  the Bill  The Pretences of the Bill are specious  viz    That the Raw Silk which the  Italian  Merchants import from  Leghorn  is  French  and the Return for their  French  Cloths sold in  Turky  That the Quantity of the said Silk imported into  England  is very great  That it is injurious to the  Turky  Trade  If these Things were really so every Man should grant the Consequence at the first Word  viz  that  the Bill was necessary  which is what they alledge  But as was said in one of the  Italian  Merchant's Cases These Things would go a  great Way in the Charge  but for one Misfortune  attending them which is  that  they happen not to be TRUE  The chiefest Evidence they bring of it is That in the Years and a very great Quantity of Raw Silk was bought in  France  brought to  Leghorn  and shipp'd to  England  Now tho' I should grant this that in those two Years a great deal of  French  Raw Silk was brought from  Marseilles  yet that will neither prove that it has been so in other Years or that it can ever happen so again Nor if it were to happen again can they argue from it any Advantage to the  French  Trade or Disadvantage to the  English  but just the contrary as will appear in the following Heads  From the Reason and Occasion of the  French  Merchants having that great Quantity of Raw Silk upon their Hands at that Time  viz  That they had a Prospect of an open Trade with  England  for their Wrought Silks  the Treaty of Commerce being then on foot here  Which failing and the Alteration of their Coin happening at the same Time they were oblig'd to sell off the Silk Raw at a very great Loss so that half the Banquiers of  Paris  half the Banquiers of  Lions  and almost all the Merchants  at  Marseilles  were ruin'd by it and became Bankrupt having lost above one third of the Value of their Capital Stock If this be the Way that the  Italian  Merchants shall always encourage the  French  Trade the  French  will have little to boast of and the  Levant  Company little to complain of  It is well known that the  French  did not receive that great Quantity of Silk which was then upon their Hands in Return for Cloth or any Manufactures all the Cloth that cou'd have been in  France  cou'd not have purchas'd it but they sent away Ready Money and bought up such a Quantity  upon the Prospect  of Advantage by the Treaty of Commerce in  England as above  the Disappointment of which was the Ruin of so many Merchants there  When the Raw Silk in  France  was thus cheap and bought by us so much to their Loss it was greatly wanted in  England  and the Price in  January  refus'd by  Turky  Merchants here was  s  and  s  per lb  and there was not Silk enough to be had in  England  to employ our Weavers or to carry on our own Silk Manufacture  so that  at this Time which these Men dwell so much upon the Importation of  French Turky  Silk was infinitely the Advantage of our Trade and in Proportion ruinous to  France  And the Silk so Imported was about  June  sold to our Manufacturers in  London  at  s  And the Price will be always kept low so long as there can be two Importations  This sufficiently answers the great Importation in the Years on which these Men insist so much and proves that it was a Circumstance of Trade which can never happen again and if ever it shou'd wou'd every Bale of it be an incredible Advantage to  England  and a Disadvantage to  France  And 'tis hop'd that an extraordinary Case which can never in the ordinary Course of Trade happen again will not be look'd upon a sufficient Reason to break into an Act which is the support of our Navigation  That it cannot be thus now is plain and the  Italian  Merchants have made it appear so by the Calculation of the Price of Silk at  Leghorn  and at  London  which generally is and for the last three Years has been from  s    d  to  s    d per lb  cheaper in  London  than at  Leghorn  which is a sure Rule to judge by why this Importation cannot be considerable for that Merchants never extend or continue a Trade that they cannot carry on but to Loss Nor indeed can there ever be any considerable Importation of Raw Silk from  Leghorn  but when the  Turky  Company by their oppressive Limitations and other monopolizing Arts restrain or withhold the Importation of a Quantity sufficient for the Market on purpose to advance the Price for their private Gain And this Engrossing is so easy to them such a Grievance to Trade and so injurious to our Manufactures in  England  that even the Possibility of their doing so is an unanswerable Reason against their Bill and proves that it not only is not NECESSARY as they pretend but that it is absolutely necessary their Power of imposing upon the Market as above should be restrain'd  The  second Head  is the Quantity which they pretend is Imported to which the  Turky  Merchants have annex'd no Evidence expecting to be taken upon their Words This Quantity they alledge to be about an hundred Bales a Year but this the  Italian  Merchants deny and appeal to the CustomHouse Books for their Proof Also they have prov'd at the House of Commons that in the current Year all the Raw Silk imported at  Leghorn  from  France  amounts to no more than thirty six Bales And that  Italy  for expence of their own Silk Manufacture annually uses two or three hundred Bales of  Turky  Raw Silk  The last is That this is injurious to the  Turky  Trade and this they explain two Ways  That it is the Return of the  French  Cloths sold in  Turky  and consequently assists the  French  in their Sale of Cloth in  Turky  That it ruins the Market for the  Turky  Raw Silk here at  London  by sinking the Price of it so as to make  the Merchant lose by his Goods or keep them on his Hands unsold  The  first  is incumbent on the  Levant  Company to prove which they only barely asserted when on the contrary the  Italian  Merchants prov'd that from  Leghorn  according to the constant course of Trade all the  Turky  Raw Silk imported from  Italy  was the Return of  English  Manufactures And to this they offer'd to call Merchants who had resided there for these Forty Years last past  To the  second  the  Italian  Merchants say That the affording all Commodities to our Manufactures cheap is a General Benefit and the Importing them dear will make our Neighbours undersell us  Now neither of these being true as above how will it appear that this Trade is injurious to the  Turky  Trade from and to  England  The Appearance of these Things being thus and all these Pretences for the Bill being thus repeal'd and expos'd it leads me to the original Design of the  Turky  Merchant's pushing this Affair so warmly  and to enquire what must be the true Reasons for their desiring the Bill to stop the Importation of so small a Quantity of Raw Silk as  communibus annis  is brought into  England  from  Leghorn  And this Question necessarily carries me back to view the State of the  Turky  Trade which I shall study to do as clearly and with as much Brevity as I have done the  French  The Trade to  Turky  is carry'd on in a Company their Charter their Privileges their Manner of carrying on their Trade is known The Number of Persons concern'd in their Trade or Free of their Company is great they tell us they are above Two Hundred and others may and indeed all even the  Italian  Merchants themselves may be Free of this Company paying the usual Fine at their Admission and taking the Freedom of the City also  But I suppose it will not be contended that the Gross of the Trade to  Turky  is carry'd on by a very few Men and even of those few a yet fewer Number have the governing Influence of the Trade and can go far very far to limit the  rest by their Interest to Ship or not to Ship Trade or not to Trade as their Quantities of Goods Abroad or at Home want a Market or want a Price  And as this is an Article which renders the Company a most effectual Monopoly when they make Use of it so it is evident that it is but a little while since they did effectually make Use of it to the great Injury of the Trade and this Power together with an Oath every Merchant must take if he will come in to be Free of this Company and which subjects him to be subject to such monopolizing Arts as those is the Reason why the  Italian  Merchants have always declin'd the Company and carry'd on their Trade to  Turky  by the Way of  Leghorn  In Favour of this Trade which as it is a fair and just Branch of Commerce and was found to be very considerable but above all as it was found to be a just Check upon the  Turky  Company and calculated to prevent the Encroachment they were always apt to run into for their private Ends to the Injury of the  English  Trade and Art of Navigation a Law particularly calculated for the  Encouragement of Trade and the Encrease of our Shipping thought fit by a Clause on Purpose to make Provision for the Trade of the said  Italian  Merchants and that they shou'd be allow'd to import the  Asiatick  Goods by Way of  Leghorn  And here I must say lies the whole Stress of the Bill now depending It is this Trade to  Turky  by the Way of  Leghorn  that the  Turky  Merchants push at The bringing some  French  Raw Silk by Accident and on an extraordinary Occasion when it may be very cheap in  France  and very dear in  England  this is made the specious Pretence but is nothing in the Case it is the  Italian  Merchant's Trading to  Turky Viâ Leghorn  that is the Grievance This is that they shoot at tho' they set up the other as a Blind  To clear themselves of this and if they would have the House believe them to be as good Patriots as they pretend why do they not declare openly that they desire nothing but to prevent the bringing in  Turky  Raw Silk bought of the  French  that the  French  may not be encourag'd to carry on the  Turky  Trade  to their Disadvantage and to send greater Quantities of  French  Cloth to  Turky  and the like  Had this been the real and only Thing they had sought what Need had they to strike at the Root of the  Italian  Trade which is so much more considerable and advantageous than their own Why Petition for the Repeal of a Clause which admits them to bring Home the Returns of their Trade to  Turky  Why had they not only pray'd that an ACT might pass to prohibit Raw Silk from  France  being imported by Way of  Leghorn  in which all the  Italian  Merchants would readily have concurr'd and are still ready to do it  Or on the other hand if they were not asham'd at thus publickly aiming to monopolize both the Cloth Trade in  Turky  and the Silk Trade in  England  I say if they were not asham'd of such an open Attempt to engross an exclusive Trade and that they could think a House of Commons the Guardians of Liberty could be capable of being brought into such an Invasion of the Liberties of Trade why did they not petition fairly That  the  Italian  Merchants might not carry  English  Cloths and Tin into  Turky Viâ Leghorn  or in a Word that if they did they should not be allow'd to bring back the Returns of it into  England  This had been indeed to have acted with less Cunning but with more Honesty than to aim and strike fairly at this Prohibition under Pretence of prohibiting bringing in  French Turky  Silk a Thing which as it is prov'd is seldom done so it is plain it can never be done but to our Advantage and the Loss of the  French  Merchants  unless it be  as above  when the  Turky  Merchants have put the Dice upon  the Market  and rais'd the Price to an unreasonable and injurious Heighth  and then the Refuge of a  French  Market or of any other Market would be but a Justice to the Manufactures and a just Check upon the Engrossers  It seems necessary in the next Place to give a short State of this  ByTrade  as they would call it from  Italy  to  Turky  or from  England  to  Turky  by Way of  Italy  The  Turky  Merchants take much Pains to represent this Article as very small and inconsiderable but why then do they not propose to the Parliament that in the Bill they solicit for a Clause be reserv'd for leaving this little small inconsiderable Trade entirely free and its Returns free to be brought Home If it be small the Damage to them must likewise be small Why is it so hotly oppos'd and attack'd if it were really so small and inconsiderable as they represent it I can answer for the  Italian  Merchants that they would not have struggled with them for the preserving it and even the Opposition made to them by the  Italian  Merchants is an Evidence to all the World that it is very far from being a small and inconsiderable Trade  By this very Thing the whole Quarrel may be decided If the  Turky  Merchants aim only at and desire only the preventing the bringing  French Turky  Silk hither and are willing to leave the  Italian  Trade to  Turky  and back to  England  by the Way of  Leghorn  open as it always was let them say so ask for that and the  Italian  Merchants will heartily join with them but while they thus push at one  Thing under Pretence of another they most plainly discover what they endeavour to conceal  It is meet therefore to put this Affair in a clear Light The  Italian  Merchants Trade to  Turky  by Way of  Leghorn  is far from being small or inconsiderable they export and sell in  Turky  from to Thousand Pounds a Year in  English  Cloth and in Tin Lead  c  a considerable Sum and they bring back the Returns of it to  Leghorn  Great Part of those Returns being sold in  Italy  the Produce of which must be clear Gain to the Publick Stock of  Great Britain  it would be very hard if they should be deny'd the Privilege of  English  Men and of bringing Home the rest to sell in their own Country as Markets may present  Except in the Cases already mention'd they bring no Silk from  Marseilles  and nothing but the Exorbitances of the  Turky  Company imposing upon the Markets as before can make it practicable If the House thinks fit even to prevent it under those Exorbitances they submit it wholly  to the Wisdom of Parliament but they humbly hope they have a Right of Property in common with the rest of his Majesty's faithful Subjects to bring back and vend in open Market the Returns of the  English  Woollen Cloths and other Products of their own Country which they export and without which they cannot carry on their Trade  While the Company oppose so just a Request how can they take it ill that we say they are a dangerous Monopoly and how can they clear themselves of the Charge while they seek to be the only Exporters of Cloth to the whole  Turkish  Empire and the only Importers of Raw Silk to the King's Dominions Is it not plain that in this Case they would consult their own Advantages rather than the Demands or Occasions of the Manufacturers  This is the Article the Company visibly press for and it cannot be deny'd but it is of great Consequence to them that is to say to them personally and as a Company but the more it is so of the more fatal Consequence would it be to the Trade in general seeing they would  as above put their own Price upon their Woollen Cloth at home to the Impoverishing if not Destruction of the Manufacturer and their own Price upon their Silk at Home Nor would it weigh with them that by this Conduct they would lessen the Consumption of  English  Cloth in  Turky  and to hold it up to a Price for their private Gain keep it always scarce at Market forbidding their Members in  England  to ship but in general Ships sometimes once a Year sometimes once in two Years or more as they think fit without regarding that by this Means there would be many Thousands of Cloths less exported than the Markets would otherwise carry off to the irreparable Damage and Discouragement of Woollen Manufactures and the Encouragement of the  French  and the Ruin of the Clothiers who when they had made large Quantities of Cloth for the  Turky  Trade must be oblig'd to keep them on Hand or perhaps sell them under Price to two or three rich money'd Men who make Use of the Necessities of the poor Clothiers for that very Advantage all which still proclaims them a Sett of Monopolizers in the worst Sense of the Word  And this very Practice throws another Charge back upon them which they never can get off from and which they now endeavour to put upon the  Italian  Merchants  viz  That whereas they alledge that the  Italian  Merchants are the Supporter of the  French  Trade to  Turky  the contrary of which is manifest the  Turky  Company by not duly supplying the Markets by laying Mulcts and Restraints upon the  English  Cloth which comes there by Way of  Leghorn  by swearing their Factors and Servants not to sell any of their Goods but for present Payment whereas the  French  give Credit where there is any Certainty or Security of being paid By these I say and many such like Methods they are themselves the Encouragers and indeed the Supporters of the  French  Trade to  Turky  who on the contrary were the Markets constantly and fully supply'd and proper Measures for Trade pursu'd as would be if the Trade were open'd as it might be would not be able to vend one quarter Part of the Cloth which they now sell there I do not mean by this totally to lay open the  Turky  Trade but humbly hope your Lordships in your great Wisdom will put it on the foot the  Russia  Company was by an Act of the  th  of King  William  and Queen  Mary  and I do believe such an Act would effectually drive the  French  out of the  Turky  Trade and have the same effect that had  viz  That instead of six or seven Sail of Ships the then  Russia  Company annually employ'd and the now  Turky  Company annually employs the next Year the  Russia  Merchants sent Sail of Ships and do now annually employ above a hundred and twenty and our  English  Manufactories are now carry'd to Places where before they were never so much as heard of And this would be the Case of the  Turky  Trade were the  Levant  Company regulated by a like Act of Parliament and the Honour of the  English  Nation kept up with a much less Charge on our Manufactures than it now is for the Trade being more diffusive half  per Cent  instead of two would be sufficient to defray the necessary National Charge  So that in a Word it is the  Turky  Company who encourage the  French  and many Ways this may be made out As for Example the  d  of  May  by laying a Mulct of five Dollars  per  Cloth on all  English  Cloth which comes thither  from  Leghorn  when the  French  Cloth comes in Free forbidding  English  Cloth from  Leghorn  to come in  English  Ships but permitting  English  Ships to bring  French  and  Dutch  Cloth Free as above They tell us if we  stop the  French  Silk from coming hither we destroy them at once  How can they impose this upon Mankind when 'tis known that all the Cloth the  French  Merchant can send to  Turky  will not supply the Demand they have for Silk in  France  But they buy a great deal with ready Money as was the Case those two Years and when they lost so much Money by it as almost ruin'd them all And what must our poor Manufacturers have done in  England  in those two Years had they not been supply'd by the  Italian  Merchant's buying that Silk cheap Is it not evident their Goods must have cost them here  l per Cent  more than the  French  and  Italians  cou'd have imported them at the Consequence of which must have been that our  English  Manufacturers must have been starv'd and Wrought Silks from all our neighbouring Manufactories instead of  Turky  Raw Silks wou'd have been run in upon us from Abroad  It is deny'd and has already been explain'd that  Turky  Raw Silk ever did or ever can come from  France  hither by Way of  Leghorn  in the ordinary Course of Trade 'Tis plain it can never come but when their Markets in  France  are so full and so low as that they must sell it to great Loss or when our Markets starv'd by the Cunning of the Company are so extravagantly dear that to reduce the Price will be our Gain so that in short to bring the  Turky  Silk in either of those two Junctures will be always to our Gain and to the Loss of the  French  And in which of these two lies the Advantage to  France  I would fain have these Gentlemen answer  But let us examine next what Disadvantage the  Turky  Company can pretend to suffer from the  Italian  Trade Can any Merchants complain of the Competitors who cannot trade under them but at a Disadvantage of or  per Cent  and if they please or  per Cent  unless Means can be found to evade the Force of their Impositions it cannot be the Advantage must lie somewhere else and it is manifest it does so  viz  in the having Power by an exclusive Trade to impose  other Rates and Prices upon the Markets Abroad and at Home than they have ever yet been able to do This it is they aim at and this they find they can come at no other Way but by putting a Stop to the Merchants sending Cloth to  Turky  by Way of  Leghorn  and bringing back the Silk to  London  and this they cannot expect but by perswading the World to believe than which  nothing can be more false  that this Silk comes from  France  Again to prove the Inconsistence of this Pretence I would desire those Merchants to calculate the Price which this Silk costs the  French  Merchants in  Turky  whether it be bought for Cloth or for Money let them add to it the Charges of carrying first to  Marseilles  then bringit from  Marseilles  to  Leghorn  then shipping it again for  England  Commission in all those Places and Charges of sundry Sorts also Insurance and the like and then let them take the Price in  France  and at  London  at the same Time and tell us if the  French  gain or lose by the Trade If the  first  let them prevent it by such legal Methods as they shall think fit If the  last  which I affirm is true what can be the Meaning of so warmly  engaging against a Trade which the  French  lose Money by  I observe in several of the Cases given out by the  Turky  Company they would be thought very popular and claim it of the World that they are the great Encouragers of the Woollen Manufacture and that they not only export great Quantities but that they take all proper Measures to encourage the Consumption of it in the Country whither they carry it  But were this true how comes it that there are so many ByLaws for the Discouraging any one to bring it thither but themselves such as laying a Mulct or Duty of Dollars  per  Bale upon all the  English  Cloth that shall come by Way of  Leghorn  not allowing it to be brought in  English  Ships when at the same Time  as before  the  Dutch  and  French  Cloth  as I have observ'd already  may come in  English  Bottoms also forbidding their Factors there to sell any  English  Cloth but for the Company and the like  Let any indifferent Person judge whether this is encouraging or whether it is not rather a visible Combination to discourage  and destroy the Trade of our  English  Cloth in  Turky  With what Assurance can these Men bring a Rabble of Packers and ClothDressers Clothiers and Dyers and other Mechanicks up to the Door of the House to solicit in their Cause as if the whole Manufacture was concern'd which is making the poor ignorant Clothworkers and Manufacturers so many Soliciters against themselves and bringing them to be Parties to their own Destruction as Manufacturers  So also they bring the Pewterers and Dealers in Tin insinuating that they are great Benefactors to the Tinmines supposing perhaps that this may have some Influence on such Members as represent the Stannary Towns and who are suppos'd to have Estates in the Mines of Tin in the Counties of  Devon  and  Cornwal  But are they so ignorant as to imagine that the  Cornish  Gentlemen do not know that the  Italian  Merchants are much greater Exporters of Tin than the  Turky  Merchants even to above double the Quantity and that as well to  Turky  as  Italy  Which Things if duly known  and if the  Italian  Merchants were as much enclin'd to make themselves popular and needeed it as these Men do would presently bring the Manufacturers Dyers Dealers in Tin and the like to appear on their Side rather than on the other  But I leave all these little Things as Artifices too mean to be taken Notice of and fit only to assist a bad Cause I come next to enter into the Merit of this Question with Regard to the Navigation It must be of some Concern to let the World see how many Ways this Company who value themselves so highly are an Obstruction and Discouragement to our Navigation and to the employing both Shipping and Seamen even in this very Trade in which they would pretend to recommend themselves  They were indeed enquir'd of at the Bar of the House how many Ships they employ'd to  Turky  in a Year and tho' I hear they answer'd falsly and said Ten which is more than they employ and in some Years send none at all yet at best what Number of Ships is this to boast of or to give them any Claim to be Encouragers of Navigation  On the other hand the  Italian  Merchants alledge That they hinder by their Limitations upon the Trade ten times more Ships being employ'd than all the Trade they carry on employs Tho' they have all the Grand Seigniors Dominions for their Trade the others only  Italy  they employ or Ships a Year the  Italian  Trade near to many of which lie mouldring in Port while the  French  and other foreign Vessels Thanks to the Company's By Laws and Restrictions run away with all the Freights to  Turky  whilst our Ships for want of Employ as usual in the  Levant  are oblig'd to return home Empty  Which Way shall these Men be discours'd with Let impartial Men but hear their Argument How incoherent How inconsistent with itself If they talk of our Importation to  England  'tis exceeding great On the other hand if they talk of our Exportation from  England  'tis exceeding small tho' we vend and send or  l  a Year in  English  Cloth to  Turky  by Way of  Leghorn  If we speak of our Trade to  Turky  they tell us one Ship a Year will bring  all our Returns and there is not above Cloths a Year brought into  Turky  and yet at the same Time speak of our Returns as a Thing fatal to their Trade To avoid the Absurdity of these Things they insist and affirm That the Silk we import is from  France  offering nothing to prove it but their affirming positively that it is so the Credit of which the  Italian  Merchants desire to be excus'd as to their giving any Weight to and as positively deny it  But there is a Way how the  Turky  Merchants may obtain all that they ask'd and which if it may be obtain'd no Cloth will be carry'd to  Turky Viâ Leghorn  any more and no Raw Silk be brought from  France Viâ Leghorn  any more no Clamour against the  Turky  Company's being a Monopoly will be made any more no Interruption to our Navigation will be made by the Company more but the Trade will flourish the Company will be enrich'd and the Nation also And this is but by  laying open the Trade  to all Mankind on the foot of the  Russia  Company to trade freely and unconfin'd to send out Ships when they will and by what Ways they will and every body being  left to push their own Trade there is no doubt but the Grand Seignior's Dominions and the Kingdoms and Countries of  Persia Georgia Armenia  and the  Caspian  Sea might if Encouragement was given them consume much more  English  Cloth than is now sold among them  This and no other is the Way effectually to encrease the Trade to Ruin the  French  Manufactories of Cloth and to encourage both the  English  Manufacture and Navigation and in this Case a few Years wou'd bring the  Turky  Trade not to employ seven Ships a Year but seventy and perhaps sevenscore Ships  For then wou'd all the Trade be encourag'd together and those Ships that had a Hundred and perhaps two Hundred Bales of Cloth on Board wou'd run away take in Freight for other Places as for  Genoa Leghorn Naples Messina  and so to  Smyrna  or  Constantinople  and thus instead of few Ships there wou'd be many Sail in a Year employ'd  And then the Trade wou'd appear as it indeed is very considerable whereas now  tis contracted 'tis limited and indeed by those Limitations 'tis almost quite lost  The  Russian  Company is an Instance of this who while they were under the like Limitations as the  Turky  Company sent usually or Ships a Year to  Archangel  whereas they now employ above Sail of large Ships a Year one Year with another and they export infinitely more Woollen Manufactures to that Country than ever they did before and thus pushing the Trade on with all the Art and with the utmost Diligence they have brought Infinite Numbers more of People to use the  British  Manufacture than ever used it before  The like is before us and the like Advantages offer themselves for by this one Act  viz    of laying the Trade open  Industry wou'd have her Hands at liberty to struggle and to push the Trade into Countries and among Inhabitants that were never heard of before Methods wou'd then be used by the vigilant Merchant to send his Goods and to sell his Goods without exacting ready Money where Payment was sure leaving the Factor a discretionary Power to act as for himself  As The Trade wou'd thus be better'd so the Encouragement to Shipping the Encrease of Seamen and above all the Consumption of our Manufactures wou'd be enlarg'd and then the MockComplaint of the Importation of Raw Silk from  Marseilles  wou'd be at an End neither wou'd there be any Occasion of a Bill to prevent the Importation of  Asiatick  Goods from  Leghorn  every Merchant having a Liberty in the Course of his own Business to bring away the Returns directly  Likewise as a far greater Number of Ships wou'd go to  Turky  having but Part of their Loading thither from  England  and having the Liberty to take in Goods for  Leghorn Naples  and  Messina  in their Way to  Turky  so in their Return having Part of their Loading for  Italy  or  England  there being a constant Trade to and from  Turky  to  Italy  the Freight of which is considerable they will be enabled to take the rest of their Loading in  Italian  Goods at  Messina Naples  or  Leghosn  as Opportunity presents or as their Employers direct So that in this Case the End of the Act of Navigation which as I said before was to encrease and encourage  English  Seamen and  English  Shipping  especially Ships of Force wou'd much better be answer'd than by carrying on a narrow contracted Trade as now they do manag'd by about thirty Merchants only and those Thirty managd again by Two or Three by which the whole Commerce is straighten'd the Consumption of  English  Cloth hinder'd and the  Dutch  and  French  encourag'd to carry Cloth to  Turky  and worm us out of the Trade  This laying open the Trade may with Ease be so regulated as that the Ambassadors Consuls and other Officers necessary to act there may be still maintain'd and all the necessary Expences of the Trade be supply'd either by the Commerce itself or by the Publick for which suitable Provision may be made as to the Wisdom of the Parliament shall seem meet And for the compleat and easy Direction Whereof a Scheme of suitable Measures shall be presented to the House whenever such a Thing shall come upon the Stage nor is there any Doubt to be made but that the  Italian  Merchants will be able to answer all the Objections that can be justly brought against such a Change of the Company's Constitution  By the aforesaid Case which I think I have stated impartially it is humbly hop'd that the  Italian  Merchants as  Englishmen  have a natural Right to the Trade to the Grand Seignier's Dominions I shall only give the Heads of some few restrictive Orders and instance others whereby they have Tax'd our Woollen Manufactures and Navigation and prohibited even their own Members from Trading in such Manner and at such Times as they thought proper and your Lordships may then judge whether a Company with Power or assuming a Power to make restrictive Laws be a Monopoly or not  The  first  is A Mulct of  per Cent  upon all Cloth which should by Freemen be sent to  Turky  other than in General Ships laid about  Ap    Resolv'd that no Ship go to  Turky  till  October  and that then they would consider when General Ships should go That Order was continued for six Months longer which produc'd a Motion in the House of Commons against the Exorbitant  Power of the Company to the Prejudice of the Woolleu Manufactures in general and Sir  John Eyles  Sir  Peter Delmé  and others in particular had large Quantities of Cloth by them ready for the  Turky  Market  An Oath against Trusting which will be attested to be prejudicial to the Woollen Trade by their own Factors who resided several Years Abroad  Letters wrote to their Consul at  Smyrna  in Case Mr  Elliot  and Mr  Smith  refus'd to take an Oath ordering him to desire the Embassador's Warrant for seizing and sending the said Gentlemen home  About the Year an Order to prevent their own Members sending Cloth by Way of  Leghorn  to  Turky  and whereas no Penalty could be levy'd before without Conviction the Words  whereof you shall be convicted  shall for the future be left out  An Affirmation exacted from their own Members before they should be permitted to load their Goods on the Ships then bound to  Turky  that they had not from the  th  of  October  to the  th  of  July  laden any Goods or Merchandize for their own or any others Account during the said Time for  Turky  To prevent their Factors tho' for  Italy  trading with Unfreemen the Affirmation to be taken The Penalty if refus'd to make the Affirmation to be depriv'd of his Trade and pay double Duties  About the Year an Order to their Consuls to Levy before it should be Landed five Dollars upon all  English  Cloth which upon any  English  Ship or Ships for Account of Foreigners should be Imported into the Grand Seignior's Dominions from  Legborn  The usual Consulage to be paid on all Goods and Money imported into  Turky  by  English  Ships who come to load Corn and over and above the  Commander or Commanders of such Ship or Ships to give Bond of Dollars to secure the Company from any  Avania  of the  Turks  and upon Oath to give the Embassador or Consul an exact Account of the Ship and to pay one Dollar  per  Ton of  Killows  of Corn if for Account of Unfreemen  A Broke or Duty of  per Cent  upon all  English  Goods or Manufactures carry'd into any Port of the Grand Seignior's Dominions on  Engglish  Ships from  Italy  or any Port of Christendom for Account of Aliens or Persons not Free of the Company and the Lord Embassador or Consuls to require Payment before they suffer such  English  Ships to depart This Order was made about the Year  An Order to their Factors not to load any Goods or Merchandize whatsoever on any  English  Ship or Ships for  England  which from  Italy  may or shall bring any  English  Cloth  An Order made in the Year reciting That whereas Captain  Beal  had by Freights in the  Levant  Seas  gain'd a sufficient Sum to purchase a Loading of Currants and had on the Value of the said Loading of Currants paid only the customary Consulage it is order'd That in Case Mr  Porten  here of whom the Company had made a Demand of double Consulage should not pay it that in such Case if ever the said Captain  Beal  shall return to the Grand Seignior's Dominions they desire their Embassador and require their Consul to Batulate both Ship and Captain And it is further order'd That no  English  Ship whatsoever but such as belong wholly to Freemen of the  Levant  Company or are Freighted by the  Levant  Company shall for the future load any Fruit  ERRATA  PAge lines for  House of Commons  read  Parliament  And whereever it is called a  Bill  it should be  Act
