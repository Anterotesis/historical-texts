interdicted at present from writing to her and the sentiments which now oppress me are indeed on  all  accounts improper to offer a mind pierced by so similar a sorrow Yet to restrain the whole dreadful weight in my own bosom would surely kill me Do  you  then O my dear cousin my worthy Caroline do  you  assist me  Tell me I conjure you where the feeling heart shall find a sanctuary Tell me what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which assails an unhappy woman when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the most complicated and decisive Henry your  favourite  Henry is gone you know to defend his country to signalize his bravery and to serve his King I admit the propriety of the enterprize according to the laws of  honour  but I weep at the extremity of its horror when tried by the laws of  feeling  and  humanity  The glowing arguments of that dear departed I did not dare to oppose  I faintly breathed the female resistance I feared lest my affection might seem to be selfish by contesting the point of separation I violated the softness of my sex and the tenderness of my nature to restrain the flowing tide that rose in billows to my hearr which laboured with the agony of suppression His being this moment upon the sea eager to gain the seats of hostility is a proof of it Perhaps I might have seduced him from this adventure since humanity and love oh how opposite from ravage and war are the principles which figure fairest in the spotless history of Henry's youth But I dreaded the after operations of inexorable honour which might detest the  trembling hand that saved it from the sword  Yet  now  my Caroline  now  that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings and can no longer be disarmed by their sweet oppression suffer oh suffer me to mournsuffer me to execrate that insatiate and wanton  power  which scatters desolation o'er the land Ah this dire  daemon  of  battle  this  daemon  who with giant footsteps tramples upon the best and most beautiful affections of the soulwho delights to hear the wail of the wounded and the groans of the expiringwhose vessels sail upon a sea of tears and are wasted by sighs which are extorted from the tender bosom  I see I see the sanguinary power He shoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy in a robe of crimson ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries The soft verdure of the spring withers into the sterility of winter as he advances The streams of plenty which fertilized a happy world stand checked in their progress or roll onward a bed of troubled waters Behold where the ruthless monarch approaches The bounties and the beauties of nature fall before him Territories are torn up by the roots and empires mingle in the common ravage Chained to his triumphal carbehold the lover the orphan the friend the father and the widow Oh Heavens Fear despair and all the bleeding virtues  and all the family of pain form his retinue Dreadful dreadful procession And all for whatfor what my Caroline Wherefore is the peace of the world thus to be destroyed wherefore is man to raise his hand against the life of man and deliberate murder to be entitled to applause  Hear O humanity the reply and be  still  if thou canst The rulers of different realms in the wanton exertion of power infringe upon what is falsely called the property of each other Men who are utter strangers to the very persons of one another and are separated perhaps by partitions of a thousand leagues quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which  shall presently cover the toiling race and the lives of a people are devoted to the sword Earth itself wide as is extended her beautiful domain is not  enough  extensive for these pigmy mortals to divide amongst themselves nor are the natural miseries of a very shorn life with all its moral all its civil all its social evils sufficient without the aids of untimely and  voluntary  slaughter The hurry of the scene the din of the battle and that political music which drowns the cry of distress may  pass over  these sentiments and humanity will not have time to hear nor to be heard But in the quieter moment when the  gentle  power revisits the bosom and resumes the lovely throne from whence she has been driven oh  how impious and how contemptible will appear those bickerings which terminate in the effusion of human blood And could these heroes enter coolly into the  consequence  of this barbarous practice this practice of defacing and hacking away the express image of their God to ascertain privileges in a world which was made for the reception and accommodation the peace and the pleasure of  all  mankindcould they be spectators of the calamity which equally attends the shout of victory and the shriek of defeat could they behold the inconsolable wife sink upon her widowed bed and the child stretching forth its little hands in vain to greet a returning fathera father left naked mangled  and unburied upon a foreign and an inhospitable shorewould not the touch of human pity assert its softening pressure and all agree to cultivate the blessings of universal brotherhood  How many wretches forlorn and fallen are at this instant pining away on the sorrowsteeped couch while the heedless multitude echo the praises of one who has earned a laurel at the expence of adding acres to his King and anguish to his countrywomen I am no politician Mrs Arnold I am a human being I am a christian I am one who prosess to adore a religion of peaceone too who can never be persuaded that the  cherub countenance of manthe express image of the deity is created thus fair and thus amiable to be cruelly sported away in the riots of ambition pride and folly  Ah my dear Henry alive as thou art to all that is most endearing what will be  thy  sensations  after  the bloody affray Thou whose bosom is gentler than the mildest and kindliest breezes of the springwhat wilt  thou  feel should some hapless woman attended by all her little orphans demand of thy victorious hand the slaughtered husband and the slaughtered sire Or should but thy  fancy  suggest such a groupe rushing through the ranks and in piercing tones of  agony exclaiming  "restore restore  them to me"how would'st thou support it Thou Hammond whom the female sigh the female tear the female shriek would at any time penetrate to the soul  On the other hand and the chance alas is equal should it be  thy  fate to falloh thou dearest bestbeloved and most  worthy  to be soshould the malignant star that influences full often the hero's fortunesshould it ordain that  O Caroline Caroline I congeal with horror I can derive no lasting serenity from the pious example of the resigned Louisa I rage I rave I  cannot bear it Indeed I cannot Hope duty religion are insufficient I shall be detected in the deepest exigence of my sorrowThe tears are deluging my paper My senses seem to turnI am bowed to the earthI amOh how shall I conceal what I amHow disguise the horrors which press down the spirit of the most afflicted  EMMA  LETTER LV  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  MY fair pupil makes a surprising progress in her new studies and were not her heart too soft to support the pain occasioned by her hand she would in a little time perform her amputation and dress her wound with the best of us  She seeks this barren novelty of knowledge by way of solace yet it affords her little for through all her efforts to amuse and to disguise I can see her distress Ah Frederick that it was permitted me to relieve that distress Yet if  Henry  's image still exists in her bosomand oh  how likely that it shouldit would be the very  phrenzy  of hope to expect success on my part Would I had continued in India Fortune has been extremely perverse The gaiety of my character is passing away Every pleasant habit is dropping from me and the peace of my soul is about to take flight Can a virtuous passion produce these revolutions Yes Frederick nothing  but  a virtuous passion  can  produce them It is a  chaste affection  and will depend upon it be one way or another rewarded But it is very poignant and yet we best love the wounds of elegant tenderness when they cut most deeply into the heart My affection for Emma increases with the increasing difficulty  of declaring it and though a much longer silence seems intolerable to  break  that silence appears a circumstance yet less to be supported by  Your ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LVI  TO EMMA CORBETT  WELL my dear and dutiful daughter ever kind and ever considerate to me I have not teazed you by premature importunityI left you quietly to the effects first of society and then of solitude I want words to tell you how I am touched by those exertions you have made to acquire a conquest of reason over passion and though I have sometimes detected the tear upon your cheek and felt the breath of your sigh as it broke by stealth from your bosom yetIn short my sweet girl it seems now to be a proper crisis to communicate the hopes anxieties and expectations  of my heart O I have some important secrets to disclose yet I tremble to begin Wherefore  should  I tremble You are delicate and obliging Ere I quit this sublunary scene I have  two  great ends to wish accomplished and after that welcome the moment which shall reunite me to the cherub who was once your mother and who gave to me my NOW only childwho gave the pledge of her fidelity to these paternal arms in this very roomfor  here  was Emma born and here is the proper place to date an address which intreats her to make her birth a blessing to me  When  and  where  then shall an aged father whisper his wishes to a daughterO let the reciprocal duties be  exchanged my dear Emma without  much  delay I love you with my whole soul and you will return the full luxuriance of my affection The Times are greatly changed and require great innovations of conduct New modes of duty spring from new circumstances Let us generously accommodate ourselves to incidents which render improper to day what might yesterday be right I solicit an interview Take your own time yet think that time is very  precious  and treat me like a friendtreat me like a father Enough I write to my child I write to Emma and her heart will tremble to the tender claims of  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER LVII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  O My father why this unnecessary preparation this awful ceremony Why the formal interview so solemnly announcedannounced too by a  letter  written under the same roof Ah what sir does it portend  Two  points two  great  points have you to adjust  I comeI  fly  to your apartmentto that  beloved  apartment where my virtuous motherI cannot go on I confess that some terrible suggestions have seized my heartBut I will not indulge them I will attend my dearest father ere this billet can well reach his expecting hand from  EMMA  LETTER LVIII  TO LOUISA CORBETT  I AM suddenly summoned into my father's apartment He is not there but I attend his coming In ascending the stairs I trembled at every step In this very room I was born How could my father have the fortitude to  sell  this mansionhow could he Hah I hear a noiseHe is coming For some days I have penetrated a certain design and I predict the purpose of this meeting PerhapsOh Heaven he is just at the door He stops at the head of the stairsI hear him sigh heavily This is not I feel a moment in which I can bear any addition  of distress Here is a private door that leads to my apartment My father is pacing about on the other side I hear the handle of the door shake in his hand Some violent agitation is upon him At  this  time the interview would kill me He is opening the door I hasten my retreat  Adieu  LETTER LIX  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I SEND this my dearest father to your apartment to beg you will defer the honour you intend me till a quieter opportunity I find myself so extremely and suddenly indisposed that I should ill reward  your  kind attention by dividing  mine  and indeed were I not afraid of seeming to press too hardly on your indulgence I should intercede with you to make my excuses for absenting myself this whole day from the company below that I may try to recover myself by keeping quite still in my own chamber  EMMA  LETTER LX  TO EMMA CORBETT  MY dear child thank you for this relief It is mutual though I deplore the occasion Take a moment of better spirits and better health for our affectionate conversation Compose yourself Nurse your tender heart into tranquillity I should not be equal  myself  to the task this morning Pass the day in all the privacy you think fit and for your excuses to the worthy Sir Robert depend upon your friend and father  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER LXI  TO EMMA CORBETT  MY DEAR COUSIN  IT is with great willingness I sit down to make a reply to the letter you addressed to me but it is not without much concern that I find it necessary to use the pen in answer to those which you addressed to Louisa whose present state of health is such as to prevent her writing Anxious however even as she presses the pillow of sickness to alleviate the suspense of her beloved Emma in regard to the promised articles of confidence she instructs me to acquaint you in the concisest way that I am able of the  means by which she became the wife of your unfortunate brother as well as with the reasons which prevailed with her to keep that union a secret from  his  family from her  own  and from the  world  She conceives too that the deeper colours of distress in  her  fate may by comparison alleviate the softer tints of wretchedness in  yours  for at the worst my dear cousin as matters now stand you have a lover living who is very properly the object of many a charming hope while the poor Louisa is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lovereven a husband and a father who is the object of many a misery too mighty for the solace of sighs and tears  With respect to the letter I have had the pleasure to receive from you it bespeaks a heart overflowing with streams of genuine philanthropy and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett But believe me believe a woman who has been connected from her infancy with men devoted to the trade of armsbelieve the daughter of a veteran chief and the widow of one who felt the military passion in all its forcebelieve  her  when she tells you that such gentle arguments are never of the least consequence in the eyes or on the minds of a soldier They serve only to make female weakness the more pitied by the men who think the dignity of a more resolved courage  concerned  to shew itself in  contrast  Sometimes it is true the tears of a wife will excite the manly drop in the eye of a husband but it tarries not The voice of public fame is on these occasions louder than that of private affection The world fixes an earnest look on the actions of an officer One hero inflames another the sparks of glory pass like an electric power the necessity of a brave  example  becomes apparent the profession soon grows into a darling passion The blood warms the genius of war takes possession of every faculty homeconnexions are forgotten the scene of action terminates the prospect the warrior can see no farther Valour and victory seem marching before him There is  not leisure for a private emotion and tenderness would assist the efforts of his foe He gives himself up therefore nobly and absolutely to the battle wounds can make no impression upon him in the progress of his ardent career and death itself is in that moment less terrible than defeat  These my lovely cousin are not the sentiments of a theorist but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who practised every action they relate In the period of peace few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the English officers and all the endearing qualifications which make up the great domestic characters are to be found amongst  them but in the day of contest my cousin a different duty calls upon them and military fame is as easily wounded and its wounds as vital to felicity as those of a woman  Let not your glowing pencil paint the protectors of our country as beings destitute of every tender feeling but allow for their situation which sometimes renders incompatible the immediate union of love and glory or the duties of peace with the duties of war  While I close this sentence Louisa expresses a wish to write to you  herself  Tomorrow she imagines that she shall be equal to the task and she  assures me that nothing which relates to the history of  her  husband and  your  brother can come so properly from any pen as her own In the hope of her gaining strength for the friendly effort I will fold up my letter and bid you farewell  CAROLINE ARNOLD  PS I find you are still indisposed and may perhaps want amusement in your solitude To this end I send you the FRAGMENT of a little military history found amongst my father's papers It will shew you that humanity and bravery are nearly allied and that the tender husband and good soldier often form the same  character though they cannot always exert themselves in the same moment or perhaps were we to scrutinize nicely we should in reality find that when the soldier is hazarding his life and liberty for that of his wife his children his countrymen and his King he is  then  the tenderest lover the worthiest husband the best parent the most loyal subject and the most valuable citizen I believe it was written by my father in his youth and I consider it as a family relique  Adieu  A Military Fragment  THE CARBINES  OH for the history of that wound said I seeing a scar upon the cheek of the person appointed to shew me the hospitalOh for the history of that wound  Not worth the telling answered the man pointing to the stump of his left thigh as to a more important subject of curiosity He took me into a different quarter of the building which presented the lodgings of those who were pensioners In each was a smallbed  bed a chair and a table The attendant's name was Julius Carbine At a door leading into one of the apartments he stopped and then looked through an aperture which commanded the room  The luckiest of all moments said Juliusfor brother Nestor will soon be at it and it is a day of discipline We will enter  Julius said the owner of the apartment as we entered sit down with your company The side of the bed was covered with a clean white cloth by a little girl who opened the door and I had also a little girl with me and we all sat down It was actually  the  brother  and not the brother  soldier  only to whom Julius introduced us In their appearance there was a fraternal similarity not so much consisting in the features and limbs which remained as in the misfortunes which had happened to those invisible parts which lay scattered in different quarters of the globe  Julius was the younger of the Carbines and as he placed himself  sideways  upon the bed and desired Carbine the elder whose name was Nestor to suspend the attackhe told his story  We slept in the same cradle and were nursed up for the service Our little arms  He flourished a stump which projected about four inches from the right shoulderOur little arms  But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of himself I should offer some description of his person as well as that of his brother Nestor It is the stump of Julius which reminds me of this  Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure who in the uprightness of his youth must have risen six feet from the earth perpendicularly He had the marks of about seventy years wearing in his faceallowing for the natural vigour of his form the  invasions of incident time and profession The present stoop in his shoulders was favourable to the height or rather to the want of height in his apartment It is not without just cause that I called Nestor a  remnant  Nature originally mixed up in him her fairest proportions At the time I saw him he was a capital figure reduced For instance if you looked him in the face or more properly to speak in the residue of his face you would perceive in his left cheek a deep scarification which boasted no sort of rivalship with the glorious embrowning of the other that had received no injury Though Nestor himself said "the whole cheek in comparison with the half cheek  looked like an errant poltroon" "It is a cheek" cried he "which seems to have done no duty now here" continued he turning the other side to view with much triumph "here are the signs of service"  Both the Carbines indeed had  served  to some purpose In point of honorary credentials there was little cause of jealousy Nothing could be more equally divided than the mutual marks of brotherhood in bravery Sorely battered were the outworks of both It is worth while to observe how the matter was settled to their satisfaction and credit The thigh of Julius became the victim of a parapet but then Nestor was even with  him when he had the honour to drop his left arm in the counterscarp But as if fortune did not imagine an arm and that a  left  arm a sufficient equivalent to a whole thigh amputated at one decisive whizz by a cannon ball she deprived Nestor of his right foot which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders The younger Carbine had the track of a musquet visible at the extremity of his neck and the bullets with which that musquet was charged slanted along the left jaw carrying off some of the finest teeth in the world and which perhaps are even yet to be seen in one of the fossés To bring the military scale even on the part of Julius he has the good fortune to  conceal under his hat which upon account of that concealment he seldom wears a respectable confusion which beginning at the left ear swept away not only the greatest part of that but all that grew in its path from one end to the other which distinguishing stroke is in honour of the bastion But Julius had his  unostentatious  wounds too his shirt covering no less than six insomuch that his bosom was crossed this way and that direct and transverse like a draughtboard I detected the flush of something like victory in the countenance of Julius as he threw open his chitterlin and opened his shirtcollar under pretence of too much heat but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition  by baring his right arm to his shoulder or rather begging  me  to bare it and there discovering a masked battery of blows which were a fair match for those in the breast of Julius  Thus were the testimonies of their prowess participated and if said they either of us could have boasted a less equal division it would have been a blow too many for our friendship and perhaps have bred ill blood betwixt us  Here the fragment is torn  the veteran Carbines after having platooned and pioneered it for a number of years in the cause of their country found at length they could keep the field no longer  They entered the Temple of Peace but not quite on the footing of ordinary members The senior Carbine privately enjoyed some small privileges and the junior was in possession of the casualties derivable from shewing the hospital to such as had the curiosity to survey it and he hopped about with his  ruins  in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration  A second rent in the fragment  Now Nestor was a man of inalienable affections They were not to be subdued The military passion was by no means dead in his bosom The heart of the soldier was still visible in his little bedchamber There were to be seen suspended from the walls the battered corslet that had covered his breast and the firelock whose iron mouth was almost worn out by the loadings They were brightly burnished and the nicest care taken to clean them weekly  But this was nothing The practical part of a soldier's discipline did  Nestor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter  No sooner were we all seated by the side of the bed than a singular ceremony began He had six sons all little all living for their country and in secret training for the battle under their father It was his custom thrice in the week to turn the key upon all the pensioners but his brother and instruct his family in the art of war Poor as he was he had actually been at the cost of equipping them had fitted up for them something that resembled a uniform and in miniature accoutrements presented them with the sword the musquet and the bayonet  The soldier's science was taught them by the veteran One branch or another of the art military was the subject of every day The sons of Nestor Carbine knew not the enervating luxuries of artificial heat they thawed the severity of the seasons with nobler fires Their education was wholly martial At night they listened to the lecture and their swords were drawn forth to practice what they had heard in the morn They engaged their strengthening arms in the  mock  fight that they might be prepared for the  real  one It was now the evening of the ravelin then of the flanking now of the fortification then of the fossé now of the halfmoon then of the epaulement now of the saps and  then of the ambuscade now of the hornworks and then of the bastion now of the gabion and then again of the mines the parapet the battery or the tenaille  They had just began an engage ment as we entered the room  It will be best related before the younger Carbine tells his story Let him therefore repose a little longer upon the bed  The stripling troops were drawn up three deep in the center of the room and the object of attack was a large deal trunk set upright betwixt the contending parties One side were to  oppose and one to defend The father was commander and in good time came the brother who instead of reposing on the bed as abovementioned sprung up with surprizing agility and hopped away to head the adverse party making a kind of warlike music with a little drum tattoo'd by the timber instrument that served him for an arm Nestor meantime assumed a whistle which served for a clarionet  The engagement was carried on in the exactest military order they advanced they retreated they rallied and they came on again Every little heart panted with ambition every eye sparkled with expectation of victory  The mimic ardour soon became real and the two generals were themselves wrought up into a serious sensation Julius shouted and Nestor encouraged But presently the aspect of the battle altered for one of the  besiegers  a boy of uncommon bravery took one of the  besieged  prisoner The conqueror flourished his little foil but the captive shed tears of slavery and sorrow The general on the worsted side affected to be dismayed His opponent spirited up his army pursued his victory took a  second  of the enemy prisoner and the town that is the  box  was taken  A shout of joy was heard on one side while the poor remains of the  conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior encampment behind the bed Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drumstick but Nestor and his troops having burst the city gates that is the box  lid  proceeded to plunder It contained all the magazines of the enemy consisting of new foils martial caps belts wooden bayonets confections and fruits These were the prizes of conquest They were all fairly won and divided amongst the victors according to seniority The little girl who had sat on the bed now sprung up took a small ozier basket from a hook and strewed flowers in the path of the victorious singing a song of triumph as they marched round the  room The ceremonies however being over both parties came forward and shook hands very heartily in token of good will and then the affair ended with  God save great George our King  and a general huzza  Our little arms continued Julius whom I will interrupt no more were nursed into early vigour for the field for our father whose bones  May every Saint bless them said Nestor  have been reposing more than half a century in different parts of Flanders and Germany struck first into that mode of training which my brother has adopted Other people's children have playthings given them because forsooth they whimper for them but we were never allowed so much as a hoop or a top till we gained it by a victory We knew the difficulty of obtaining the prize and valued it the more and thus were fitted for deeds of hardihood ere other infants had an idea of glory  Poor creatures said Nestor's second son scornfully  We  could vault upon the steeds of the menage before  they  could keep  the saddle of their wooden ponies Ripe for practice we were sent forth at an early age to the field and both of us entered as volunteers in the service of our country  We did so said Nestor  Naturefor which stump as I am I still thank hergave us no bad forms and though we took the field with faces  s effeminate as that of our motherYou was reckoned the very model of her you know Nestoryet the first campaign left us no room to blush upon that score Our virgin engagement happened in the hottest glow of the summer and we were soon rid of a delicacy which is inglorious  on the front of a soldier Oh with what pleasure did we contemplate the alterations at our return  I remember it said Nestor smiling  The traits of the mother were quite worn out by the weather In every lineament there was seasoning The sun had written hero in our countenances and we rejoiced in the dignity of the tan  But mark the joke sir a fantastical pair of wenches pretended to love us in our fairweather suit of features before we made the first sally that is before we were  worth  loving but took it into their heads to quarrel with our  appearance the very moment we returned They wanted still to see the red and white of the  woman  and so took to themselves new paramoursThe jades gave us up sir for a couple of fellows who would shudder at the patter of a hailstorm  So much the better said Nestor We have had the satisfaction to see one of the rascals hanged for sheepstealing and the other you know is to be put into the pill  ory this day se'ennight  And I'll be prepared for him I warrant ye exclaimed one of the boys  No child said Nestor he is no mark for the son of a soldier  After this sir we had no lazy periods of peace Some part or another of Europe was continually beating the drum or sounding the trumpet in the ear of England It was our duty to go forth in her defence  Father said the eldest of the boys when is it likely we shall have a  war  My brother sircontinued Carbine who was not put out by any family remarksmy brother sir had the honour of the first misfortune  You do not call it by a right name said Nestor  He  triumphed in the first testimony of the warrior  I am an elder brother said Nestor and the first blow was my birthright  But I was soon even with him for towards the close of the campaign a random shotwhen I was thinking of nothing less gave the four fingers of my left hand to the enemy In that condition we entered into winter quarters  But no sooner was my brother cured of the wound in his face  You may see the mark of it here sir said Nestor  in his face than he received one much deeper in his heart  In his  heart  cried the youngest of the six sons clapping his hand on his father's sidewhy you joke here it is alive and merry now I can feel it beat  God keep it so answered the eldest It will be a sore day for us when that stops I promise thee  Give me thy hand Ferdinand said Nestor and brother do you go on with your story for it entertains the gentleman and his little daughter and I like to hear it You were always good at a story from a child Go on  would you believe it sir that a fellow so sliced should have the impudence to attack one of the prettiest girls in England  In the  world  you might have said cried Nestor shaking his knee  like a brave boy of the blade he pushed his point right on turned his  worst  side to the wench and insisted upon her taking the scars as a recommendation  Why they  were  so said Nestor holding his knee still while he spoke  in this manner he continued to batter the citadel which trembled  in the bosom of the poor girl and in less than a month no time at all for such a siege he entered the fair castle of her affections in triumph  By the blood that I have shed sir said Nestor and by the drops which  yet  flow in my body Frances was the best and bravest wench that ever lay by the side of a soldier  Nestor said Julius hold your tongueHis limbs sir were almost constantly on the move War carried them away What of that His joke was ready Never mind Frances would he say to his wife I am the winner yet Fear nothing Were I reduced to my trunk I should flourish  still my girl A soldier whose children have blood in their veins is invulnerable He is immortal in his sons  Let us  engage  father said one of the boys eagerly as he brandished his soil  Thus would my brother heal up the wounds of the war but be that as it may wounds are but sorry things in a family Often has my brother disputed with me on this subject "Julius would he say thou art but half a loyal subject still  thou  givest to thy country the services only of an individual while  I  furnish it with the force of a whole family As an  individual  thou must soon die but  hadst thou taken care to  multiply  thyself as I have done thou mightest well expect to live and conquer these thousand years Brother brother it is a false notion a soldier ought of all men in his Majesty's dominions the soonest to marry he ought indeed" Notwithstanding this sir I could never be prevailed upon No though an honest girl offered to sling my knapsack across her shoulder after the loss of my thigh To confess the plain truth to you I did not like certa in ceremonies betwixt my brother and sister at their partings Frances indeed wept but little but in my opinion she  looked  a much deeper sorrow than is to be expressed by a pair of wet eyes  Nestor hemm'd violently  And as to my brother though he cocked his hat fiercelypretended to have caught coldrubbed up his accoutrements and blustered mightily he never was steadily himselfand how the devil  should  he be for a week after These things sir are against the grain The brush of a bullet is nothing at all it may take off your head or it may only take off your hat either way no great matterbut the cries of a womanthe piercing agonies of a wife to come across one's thoughts in the last momentsno sir no damn itthere is no bearing that I will live and die a batchelor  But this is not the worst sir  Death  sometimes comes at the bottom of the account to  unsoldier  a man He knocked at brother Nestor's door and carried Frances away while she was nursing him of a fever into which he was thrown by the pain of a wound Zounds that was a terrible day Nestor was it not  Terrible said Nestor turning his head from the company  She died suddenly Courage said I brother He waved his hand and spoke not Brother said I have courage "Fool replied he in a passionif he had called me so in cold blood I would have had him out  Fool said he in a way that one could not but forgive him stamping his foot on the ground at the same time am I thinkest thou before GOD ALMIGHTY or the enemy What has courage to do before HIM thou should'st tell me to be  patient  I said no more for the poor Frances lay dead before his eyes and there being but one bed of any size the living and the dead lay together  Child said Nestor to the little girl his daughter who was sobbing at the side of the bed with her apron thrown over her eyescome hither Thou art  like  thy motherkiss me  Nestor continued Julius tied the crape round his arm and his soul was  in mourning He gave Frances to the earth Decency  Go no farther  said Nestor  Decency required  my  attendance sir My poor Carbine shed then the first tears that I ever saw upon his cheek Oh he was melted down into something softer than his mother He wanted to prevent the man from striking the nails into the coffin  Julius GO NO FARTHER I say cried Nestor pressing his daughter close to his breast  I wish my uncle would hold his tongue said one of the boys  He opened the closed lid and peeped in continued Julius He cast a lingering look into the grave He drew his hand gently over the coffin as the sexton was beginning to lower it He kneeled down to see that it was put  softly  into the ground He let it go and said he was perfectly resigned then came away and then returned then went off a second time and sought the grave again wringing his hand and declaring he was perfectly resigned all the time  Wilt  kill  me Julius said Nestor stop I say  in short sir hehehedid so many things upon that occasion  that surely if a man has any love for a woman he ought to be a batchelor  The fragment is here defaced and illegible for some pages  after the engagement the solemn thoughts again came on Julius rubbed his face twice or thrice along the pillow and declared that while the wind continued in that quarter his old achs would twinge him a little  And in this hospital sir we are now laid up for life said Julius  He rubbed his face again upon the pillow Well said he rising every dog has his day  Upon this Nestor began to whistlenot one of those tunes which arise from vacancy but a whistle truly contemplative it was more slow and pensive as he proceeded and in its closing cadence a tear started from his eye Streaming almost to the borders of the upper lip it settled there and though as he waved his head backwards and forwards it trembled upon the edge of his cheek it did not fall  When he had opened the door I stole an Opportunity to put something into his hand  He took it as money ought to be taken by a brave or worthy man who wants assistance and sees no shame in receiving it A sober smile came into his countenance but the TEAR continued  His daughter's hand was still closed in his but she looked at the tear and was taking out her handkerchief  Let it alone my dear said Nestor IT IS YOUR MOTHER'S  How are the Carbines to be envied said I when we were stepping into the street  You flatter us replied Nestor bowing gently  I went two paces and turned back  The tear had verged off possibly while he was bowing  It had got upon  my  little girl's face and there it hung like a dewdrop from a rosebud  Good God said I how rapid an exchange  In saying this I found it had vanished from the cheek of my daughter in the time that I was making the exclamation  Alas it is  quite  gone then said I  No upon lifting my hand to my face sometime after I found the precious offering of sympathy had changed a  third  time its residence and was trembling on my  own  cheek I blessed it and  LETTER LXII  TO EMMA CORBETT

ESQ  THE days of drollery are no more The character of my heart is changed Emma is sick Her father is labouring with some deep and concealed calamity and from these incidents of the family you will gather the unhappy situation of  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXVI  TO LOUISA CORBETT  I KNOW not whether I shall live long enough to relate the horrors of my situation  On the evening of the day that I desired the suspension I felt an impulse more strong and more sacred than that of common curiosity to know the full scope of my suspicions  Before  this interview my distress appeared sufficiently great Alas we are continually exclaiming that the heart will break without knowing what additional burthens it will bear even when we think it is  most  surcharged  Come hither dear Emma said my fatherdrawing me gently to himhis hand trembling as he touched my gown  Come hither I want to thank you for the long series of soft compliances which your dutiful heart hath poured into this aged bosom  But  for thee my child your unfortunate father would have no pillow to support him  Unfortunate  sir did you say  O  most  unfortunate my Emma I am in distress  worldly  distress And it is so extreme that I have been compelled ah hard necessity to dispose  of this fair mansion which hath more than a century owned a Corbett for its Lord This very room my dear which gaveoh spare me Emmathis very room the consecrated spot of  thy nativity  is now another's and so are the late hereditary lands that smile around it The ruin has been  deliberate  too and I have concealed it from every eye even and indeed chiefly from  thine  till now that I am in the  arms of poverty  There is at this moment an execution entering my house in London which contains the last reliques of a fortune that some years since amounted to an hundred thousand pounds  That accursed warthat dire  American  contentionthat civil fury which hath separated the same interests of the same people  Here it begins my childbut where will it close Oh slaveryoh imprisonment how terrible are thy horrid walls and galling fetters to  one  whose bosom burns with the divine flame of libertyhow insupportable to an old manto a father whose daughter's  consequence  in life must flow from  his  O thou lovely stream from a fountain whose sources are stoppedwhat  what  is to be done  The  decisive  blow came yesterday upon me I had ere this in reserve one rich casketbut it is gone the last capture has deprived us of it It would have been enough for  my  age and for  your  youth but the post of yesterday  It is unnecessary to detail the calamity It is crushing it is irremediable it is ruinous I am in beggary  Oh Emma bred up to elevated expectations what is to become of thee Your brother is slain Your father old and enervated a prey to pain of body from the most piercing of human disorders and to anguish of mind from reflections the most cutting  Your property both at home and abroad for mine was naturally your's lost or despoiled  Oh Emma what is to become of thee Would you renovate my youthwould you rebuild your fortunes  I could not speak Louisa  If you  would  continued my father receive with a smile those accents which inform you there is a gentlemanrich generous virtuous worthy and of whom you have a good opiniona gentleman who would esteem the  hand of Emma    Ah what have I saidoh shameful sacrificepardon pardon me my child You shall  not  be  sold  my love No no let us be above the sordid commerce Let us enter the gloomy gates together Let us be poorlet us be necessitouslet us combat the common wants of naturebut let us not be  contemptible  I sunk deathlike into his arms a weeping father's arms which staggering under their burthen bore me to the bed There I still lie and there probably in a few daysOh farewell to  EMMA  LETTER LXVII  TO EMMA CORBETT  Prior to the receipt of the above  NO my loved sister I will not cannot send a long story A few pages will comprise the main circumstances and let those suffice till days of future conversation Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage and Edward had already sufficient to his wishes He acquainted his father of the love which he bore to Louisa It produced a dispute My brother happened to be present He entered as your father exclaimed "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Louisa  Hammond of scarce an hundred pounds a year"The conversation stopped  Sir said Henry to Edward when they were alone had any man living but Emma's father spoke in those terms of my sister he should have been punished for it severelyI love  Emma Corbett  and to her he is indebted for  And I love  Louisa Hammond  sir replied your brother but my father has an arm of his own and that failing he has that of a  son  to defend him from the insults of a boy should he  dare  to  It is an improper place to discuss the question said Henry They went out Henry commanded Edward in terms of intolerable severity never to offer his hand to Louisa while Edward insisted that Henry should desist from farther engaging the affections of Emma The inhibition was promised to be observed and a breach of it was to terminate in the last frightful decision amongst men Edward ceased his visits and I knew not the cause Henry did the same and you was equally ignorant of the motive I fell sick a fever seized my spirits and my life was despaired of Edward heard of my illness and came to visit me at a time that he knew Henry was from home  He found me in the extremitythe fever was become putrid and the physician ordered no one to approach my breath any nearer than could be avoided the bed was strewed with the herbs which are supposed to prevent infection Regardless of this and every other image of selfpreservation Edward rushed into my chamber threw himself upon his knees by the side of the bed and hung his head over my face which received and welcomed the tender tears that were streaming from his eyes O Louisa Louisa said he I can bear it no longer At these words Henry was heard upon the stairs Edward leaped upHeavens said he can it be possible is Henry returned Well it is  no matter My brother entered the room and at the sight of Edward stept back like a man astonished Edward ran up to him threw his arms about his neck and insisted that the embrace should be returned Oh Henry he exclaimed too long have we mutually suffered a false delicacy to prevail Enough have we sacrificed to pique for Emma and Louisa have been the victims I heard that your sister was dying and I could not deny myself the mournful privilege of a friendwill you chide me for it Henrywill you still withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett  Will you  This was the first moment I had been informed of the dispute The surprise  was too much for me in the  firmest  state of my constitution In the condition I  then  was it had wellnigh proved fatal All which my strength suffered me to do was to raise myself on my pillow fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty and with feeble accents to implore they would spare my last moments and not embitter them by  their  enmity  Ere I had uttered this Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other and Henry said alas Edward I  owe  you more than this for on my part was the promise first broken I have secretly maintained the usual correspondence with Emma since she has been away and found  the  tenderness  superior to the  anger  of my temper Indeed we have  both  been wrong Henceforward let us be  more  than friendsif possible let us be brothers Shall we not my Edward  Again Emma I clasped my hands and a sudden sense of joy came over me that gave a turna  happy  turn to my disorder I recovered It was agreed between us that the  cause of the quarrel  and the means of t he reconciliation should be equally a secret The families were reunited and none but Edward Henry and Louisa could account for the late coolness on the part of the two former But the harmony was not of long duration  it was again interrupted by your father's violence in the cause of  America  opposed to that of my brother in the cause of  GreatBritain  Edward sided with the former and though it no longer prevented an intercourse between us it threatened an eternal separation of political interests At the same time Henry was permitted to address you and Edward continued openly his partiality for me Nay your father at last declared he hoped still to see two countries restored to the embraces of each other and two happy matches to felicitate their union You were my dear Emma fortunately from home on a visit during most of these transactions and your Henry did not think it prudent  to break the thread of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to cross it at home The contest now became fierce on the other side the Atlantic and threatened to carry bloadshed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property Louisa said he to me one evening I must cross the seas my fortune is in danger it concerns equally you and me that I should endeavour to desend it yet I will wait another month to hear the event of terms that are proposing between the countriesif they produce  peace  you know how ready I shall be to continue in England if they  fail  of that end you must have resolution enough to part from me for a short  season But continued he as no man can tell the chances of the slightest separation I ardently wish to call you by the tenderest of all human titles  mine  before I go  Publickly  this cannot be done for though my father affects to consent our union would make himun happy No Louisa let our happiness be known only to ourselves till it is proper to communicate ir Impart it nor till my return at least to Emma to Henry or to any part of the family I have my reasons for it even more strong than those that have been already related  Soon after this conversation Emma we were privately married and none of the appointments that led to the  ceremony or which succeeded it were discovered or suspected Previous to the voyage of my hapless husband he put into my hand a sealed paper containing his will and he desired I would not open it till his return In the fond hope of that return being possible I have till within these few days kept the seal unbroken and now alas I find it is a testamentary disposal of his property abroad bequeathed entirely to me as sole executrix  Yes my dear Emma there  is  a fatherless Edward and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of its birth before he died I repeatedly sent letters full of all a  mother's minute and affecting solicitude but I received no replies To Mrs Arnold dear and generous friend as she is I owe the power of keeping my husband's secret notwithstanding an event that promised to betray it The poor little one was lately taken ill and his death every moment expected It was that oh Nature made me write the disordered scrawl which intreated Emma to forbear her visit On my reaching the house of our worthy Caroline I found the cold hand of death lay heavy on my child I wept sore I offered up the prayer of the desolate widow not  wholly  to bereave me and begged ah how earnestly  the Blessed God to restore  one  or receive  both  My prayer was heard My child grew well Your letter came in the warmest newest and most melting moment of matron extacy The smile of the babe was in my eye and in my heart I saw miniatur'd forth the features of the murdered Edward Oh the beautiful extreme of rapture It grew too big for bearing I devoured my child with kisses I ran with weeping joy to Mrs Arnold I thought of thee oh lovely Emma as of Edward's sister and I gave thee in that charmingly unguarded period the dear deposit of my bosom which none but Caroline shares with thee  Edward the  infant  Edward sleeps as I write this His gentle breathing is as the music of the spheres to his mother's ear Ah had there been a pausea stopan  eternal  stop in that harmony what should I have done But he lives and I will not murmur Oh for health to rear his tender youth Emma you are his aunt and oh should this feeble frame fail to hold out so long as he may want a protector and when alas will that cease to bewill you notah will you not be unto him a mother Consider that he has  many  claims upon you He is the son of Edward your brother and the child of  LOUISA  LETTER LXVIII  TO LOUISA CORBETT  O Wonderworking Providence I feel your intelligence dearest Mrs Corbett in every vein I acknowledge you as a friend I receive you as a sister But  there  is the  boundary  of my power Embrace your child and do not complain Louisa you may now receive an example of patience from the fortitude of Emma The father and the child are both in the bed of sickness and both labouring in the dire extremes of distemper and distress I can no more Farewell I murmur not  EMMA  LETTER LXIX  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  CASTLEBERRY is the seat of confusion and calamity It seems as if I were doomed to be the murderer of my guests I can impute the illness of parent and child to no other cause than because the one too much  desires  a match which the other with too much reason  detests  Oh mighty God the mystery is explained Let the  inclosed  speak it for I have not power to transcribe  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXX  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  The inclosed  I AM not made for hypocrisy You see the gloom of my soul It sits in my countenance nor am I able to disguise it It is now  my  turn to desire you will deal with  me  plainly Within a few hours my fortunes are altered so much for the worse that it is impossible for me to desire you will advance farther in the treaty relating to Emma I cannot now give her a single guinea all she will ever have is three thousand pounds which is a legacy nor can I expect your passion to weigh down every pecuniary consideration Three thousand pounds  Sir Robert is  poverty  to what my child might have expected Suffer us then to depart I am stung to the quick by various wrongs By the close of the week I hope we shall be well enough to set out Excuse the awkwardness of corresponding under the same roof There are points that cannot be spoken to This is one I venerate and love you But do not mention the subject to Emma or to  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER LXXI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THERE wanted no fresh impediments They were manifold and mighty enough before To pursue my intentions after what I am now told would be  indeed  impracticable I should tremble to approach Emma lest I should seem to act the part rather of a purchaser than a lover O I blame not that lovely pride which poverty begets in a generous mind Shall I barely  bargain  for the hand of Emma Yet how shall I resign it Let me think  I have hit upon an expedient Mr Corbett but it will want your suffrage and assistance There is but one way left to honour and oblige me and I call on you by the rights of ancient friendship to comply with my request  No it cannot be It will not bear reflection I must submit to my fate But do not leave me yet Repose Recover Meditate what is best to be done Tell me the extent of your misfortune and let us mutually concert its mitigation  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THE irresolute note which I sent this morning to your chamber is not worth your attempting to decypher I wanted to express my sympathy of your present misfortune in a way more answerable to the emotions of my friendship I wished to gather such knowledge of some persons  connected with your loss  as might enable me to plan some pious fraud to relieve your stuation without wounding your delicacy But I should make bungling work of it and destroy the felicity I intended to promote I am a man of plain feelings and have no dexterity of address when it is necessary  to adorn them Accept then dear Corbett of an honest mind in lieu of elegant manners Is any decoration necessary to introduce a friendly circumstanceand if there is not wherefore do I thus lengthen the preface  Corbett I am one of those whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow for I value money merely as it conduces to my happiness My happiness depends on society and not on myself alone I have fixed it in the dear domestic circle that encloses Emma and her father Beyond that barrier I do nor desire to wander and if I can promote their felicity my own will of necessity be compleat  You see my system It is simple and concise By uncommon chance I am become rich you know The sum I possess is too much to be dissipated and not enough if I had a passion to accumulate It is quite sufficient to render three persons happy so far as happiness takes its colour from money Amongst three persons then let it be divided but let only two of those know the source by which the third is supplied You may easily persuade Emma to believe what indeed will be true that by an unexpected turn your losses are repaired She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze herself about the means Or if she  should  enquire her curiosity is of a tender kind and will readily  be pacified I hope you love me too well to make scruples and yet I shall prepare myself to combat them It is really a very hard and mortifying thing that these  bareweight  duties betwixt friend and friend should be so rare as to make the offer of them a matter of embarrassment as if there was nothing expected in society but its etiquette and professions All I desire is that you will lose no time in settling your affairs and no otherwise remember the  mode  by which they are accommodated than as it may impress your bosom with tender sensations and strengthen the cement of that alliance which is formed between us With Emma I will on the above conditions take my chance as before  but for the wealth of worlds I would not have her acquainted with a tittle of our private transactions Nor must you attempt to sway her Leave her to the same chances as would  before  have happened It is very unreasonable that I should expect her to marry  me  for  affection  but for Heaven's sake save me the distress of accepting the sacrificed hand of gratitude I am glad it is in my power to offer my testimonies of friendship to you before she has been  influenced  I will be with you presently and you shall have no prejudices of custom about you till you detect any thing of what is foolishly called the wisdom of the world clinging to the hand or the heart of  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXIII  TO SIR ROBERT RAYMOND  WHAT can I say to you Represent to yourself an old man bathing his pillow with the tears of his heart and suddenly struck first with fortune then with transport Oh Raymond Raymond the world sees these friendships too seldom to authorise our accepting them and many a man has been ruined because custom permitted him not to be much obliged My misfortunes indeed have arisen from the dire casualties of war and not from the wasting luxuries of peace Public desolation and not private vice has produced them  Yetthe sum so largethe situation so criticalthe  Well well I will try to recover myself and we will converse but I tremble strangely I almost think I could  make  such an offer even at this frozen time of life for my heart is yet warm but oh how shall I bring myself to  receive  it I could bear your superiority but how can I  The world is too strong for the stoutest of us Sir Robert At what a pitch must vulgar errors have arrived and what a miserable age must we live in when the hand of liberality itself  trembles  while it is extending lest its motive should  in short my friend I cannot write but come to me  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER LXXIV  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  I FANCY there was some  mistake  in the letter that I enclosed from Corbett for I find his affairs are all readjusted and the generous refusal of my overtures to Emma at a time when most parents would think them most acceptable has no longer force The prohibition is taken off and I am again at liberty to make myself tenderly unhappy  Corbett is now as much recovered in health as in his circumstances and word is just brought that Emma is better O my heart how shall I support the sight of herIf her sickness  has made any great alterationif she appears to be in pain or in any kind of danger I shall assuredly discover myself Methinks I have more fondly wish'd myself her husband since her confinement and indisposition than while she was rejoicing in health and pleasure I do not desire to unite myself to her beauty more than to her weakness and distress Surely Frederick the tender offices of a friend are  most  amiable where they are  least  observed by the world The feeblenesses to which the tender frame of woman is subject are perhaps more seducing than her bloom The  healthy  flower looks superior to protection and expands itself to the sun in a kind of  independent  state but in nursing that which  droops  sweetly dejected and is ready to fall upon its bed our care becomes more dear as it becomes more  necessary  It is the  parent  and the  friend  rather than the mere  gardener  that on  such  an occasion influences and indeed it will I believe be found upon all occasions that the gentlest parts of our nature are the best and objects are beloved in proportion not as they are strong forcible and defended but as they are gentle unresisting and pathetic  Emma dines below stairs I have not seen her for several days In the present state of my heart Frederick  can you not imagine the nature of a sensation which partakes equally of hope and fear If you  can  you will ascertain the present situation of  Your ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXV  TO EMMA CORBETT  YES my dear child what I asserted to you this morning is true By a chance seldom happening to persons in distress I have recovered myself It was like a recovery in the last struggling moment of a man's life for had the relief been delayed longer it would have been the death of my credit and you would have mourned over these white hairs in a  prison  Oh the  means  the MEANS my child by which this mighty blessing was effected The generous hand the generous heart from whence but I am forbid to speak Cannot you  guess  No It is impossible  It seems to be a flight too sublime too near Heaven for any earthly power to And yet if there  should  be any human being who has rescued your father from shame and yourself from indigenceif oh Emma there  should  be such a character moving under your eye and inviting your notice whatwhat are the emotions what the sentiments you owe him  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER LXXVI  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  FREDERICK I have again beheld the source of my admiration and distress She came she sat at table said a few words in a silver voice sighed softly and retired I never beheld any "mortal creature of earthly mould" so touchingly sweet She is more interesting as she is less in her bloom Sorrow has taken the rose out of her cheek and left only the lily which seems charmingly to lament the loss of its companion She rises every moment upon me and sickness which has weakened  her frame  appears to have given strength to  my affection  My wishes are augmented  but my expectations are not advanced I see the policy of retreat and while I  acknowledge  it am preparing to go on Yes Frederick I am resolved to open the subject and that immediately  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXVII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THESE transitions are almost too much for mebut I welcome the dear agitating stroke that gives felicity to my father As the billet which expresses it came to hand I was about to seek your bosom my venerable parent and  there  assure you with how chearful a  heart  I would follow you through every turn of your fortune and with how ready a  hand  I would labour for our subsistence I had prepared many a tender argument to prove the  frugality of nature  and to shew how easily and how cheaply she might be supplied I would have represented to you the sweets of a couch  which should have been smoothed by a daughter's care and of wholsome viands provided by your child Nor should I have failed to remind you of what in your tenderness rather than in your hurry you have forgotten namely that sum of  three thousand pounds  which in right of my late uncle I am to inheritnor of those glittering baubles which it would be  infamous  in Emma to  reserve  or to  wear  while her father is in distress But these arguments are unnecessary as you are restored to happiness and there is it seems some noble instrument which Providence has made use of to produce the blessing What sentiments and what sensations I owe to both need scarcely be made a question  If my soul is not insensible it must pour itself forth in gratitude and prayer in wonder and in praise But still methinks this friendship should be accepted sparingly my dear father While a large sum of money is within the compass of our  own ability  should not our first application be to that and  Pray forgive me you taught me to love the language of nature and must not be angry when occasion calls it forth Benevolence is a beam from Heaven and descends into the heart of man to inspirit and to chear but if we do not properly  oeconomize  it if we are  lavish of the lustre  and do nothing  of ourselves while it is darting upon us  in short my father I feel myself a little  jealous  that when it became necessary for you to place a confidence in any  second  being you did not shew your usual affection for  EMMA  LETTER LXXVIII  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  SOON after breakfast this morning while Corbett and I were walking in the garden he took hold of my hand and laying it to his breast said "Now then Sir Robert is the time my daughter is recovered Take an opportunity to display your generous attachment Faith Frederick I do not see the generosity of trying to possess a fine young woman I will give you an opportunity continued Mr Corbett and pray Heaven it be in her power to give you the possession of her hand and her heart"  IN CONTINUATION  MrCorbett informs me that Emma is now gone into the library She is he says all  tenderness  today It is then the crisis of declaration the season most proper to speak and I think I was never more  unfit  for the undertaking O that I were younger handsomer less rich and more engaging Indeed I wish most of those things altered with which till I beheld Emma Corbett I was perfectly satisfied Not a syllable however of Henry falls from her Surely that looks well At what a twig doth the drowning catch I will not close this letter till I can add to it the particulars of our conference  IN CONTINUATION  It is past It is decided I have read my fate without disclosing my condition I entered the library and found Emmaah how shall I describe to you the situation in which I found her She had been observing the ravages of war as they are figured in the prints which are hung around the room I saw the tears still standing in her eyes O those eyes  And what has been the matter Emma said I  I have been weeping over the representation of a  compleat victory  replied Emma She then traced the bloody progress of the pictured battle and in all the pathos of philanthropy addressed me thus  "O Sir Robert behold the images of conquest and defeat Observe two mighty hosts of human beings met together after the most deliberate plans of attack to butcher one anotherto perpetrate  generally  that very crime which in any  particular  instance is punished by the restitution of a shameful death To destroy an individual is ignominy but at the massacre of an army the trumpet sounds its note of boldest triumph  The gallows and the halter the awful trial or gloomy dungeon preceding these are prepared for him who in the phrenzy of passion or the raging of desire deprives the irritating object of farther  power  to torment while the laurel the bay contribute to the garland of  those heroes  who after returning from the cities they have depopulated and the territories they have laid waste come blushing home in all the honours of blood and of slaughter  She paused a moment A glow of generous scorn was in her eye and she again extended her white arm along the picture and proceeded  "Here sir you may observe lawful and  glorycrowned murder  exhibited  in every form Seesee into that wretch's quivering side the ball has just enteredHere lies a head severed from the bodyThere are the mangled reliques of an arm torn from the shoulder and there the wounded horses are trampling upon their wounded masters  "Rightsterritoriesand privileges disputed or invaded are the great justifications Poor puerile and insufficient  "Ah EARTH thou common parentthou whose nourishing bosom furnishes to  all  the children of  content  that will  cultivate  thee how art thou made the object of ambition and the  motive of sanguine altercation Into what ridiculous portions of ideal property art thou cut out How art thou quarrelled how contened for How often doth the bounteous sun that shines upon thy surface to expand the grain and to cherish thy various productionsOh how often do his beams retire and leave thy verdant mantle dipt in gore Yet thou hast  thyself  improvident mother of these wrangling emmets thou hast  thyself  been in some measure accessary to these horrors Oh that pernicious and fascinating  dross  that glows within thee Why was not the mischievous radiance concealedWhy was the cunning and the curiosity of the child thus permitted to rip the  very bowels  of its parent  and wage unnatural war with his brother about the division of the spoil Avarice and ambition are of the same family and assist the vices of each other the one delights in the plunder the other in the havock by which it is obtained  "But yonder the ruin is more rapid and

phrenzy of tenderness  and  humanity  but it trod too quickly on her late recovery She is again carried to her bed Unhappy Emma  Oh Mr Berkley what remains She has rescued me from the misery of a declaration at least Her own passion is hopeless yet fixed but mine is in despair She has added at once to my love and to my distress What nobleness of sentimentWhat virtuous sorrowWhat sacred  integrity  of attachment I shall be glad when the time for their departure arrives I shall ever be united to the family but it is impossible I find to live longer as a part of it  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXIX  TO C CORBETT ESQ  THE heart of your daughter my dear friend is not at her disposal Let her never know a circumstance which can only render her unhappy  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXX  TO LOUISA CORBETT  WE are returned to town The several inclosures will acquaint you with the affecting transactions which have past since the last stop in our correspondencea stop my dear Louisa made in very  sympathy  for though you have of late repeatedly told me that you found a pathetic kind of pleasure in sharing griefs so congenial to your own I could not but blush at the pain which I must often have created you Yet nature at this very timepoor feeble nature strongly prompts me to repeat the fault My heart swells high with sorrow and I stand in need of the participating  Louisa Nor will any  but  Louisa soothe me Mrs Arnold is generous and sensible elegant and informed but oh she has not drank so largely of that bitter yet salutary cup which subdues the effervescence of the spirit and disposes us to melt at the miseries of another She is a widow without knowing the value of her husband and love seems a secondary passion in her mind to that of glory  How is it my friend that we do not hear from Henry Ah what an affecting difference betwixt a postoffice and a ship  O  distance  DISTANCE it is now I begin to feel what thou art Join I  conjure you Louisa the prayer of Emmasupplicate the Power at whose command the winds and the waves are still supplicate him in behalf of a hapless woman whose treasure is tossing on a precarious sea Beseech that the hospitable barks may salute each other and that their separation may alleviate mine Implore that these things be granted and my heart shall be at rest  At rest and will my alarms be hushed by such a circumstance Are the beating of the  billows  all I have to fear Alas the perils of the water are merely introductory to those of the land Scarce will the dangers of the stood be past ere those of the  field come on Which way then shall my petition be directed The policy of nations and the dictates of nature the voice of ambition and that of peace are so distinct that a perpetual war seems to be proclaimed between  divine  and  human  institutions The tender and graceful interest which nature bids us take in the fate of those whose lives and fortunes are dear to us make us wish well to the natives of our country and the friends of our heart and it is on this principle but not for the parade of dominion or the barbarian flush of victory that I wish well to the cause of Henry and his associatesI do not say COUNTRYMEN for it appears that  we  are at war with these as  they  with us a large and  once  loving  family divided against itself Whom are  we  Louisa to consider then as enemy and whom as friend WE suffer alas bitterly from the contest on either side Oh God of tranquility heal up the  mutual  wound and suffer not that which is terrible between  different  people even in  hostile  nations to become more intolerably so by allowing it to rage amongst  brethren  The paths of military honour Louisa are cut through the bowels of humanity and heroism laughs at the apostrophe of pity but I who want refinement to extinguish the simplicity of my sensations shall yet persist  to call even  victory  a calamity I am extremely ill but have relieved myself by writing  Adieu  EMMA  LETTER LXXXI  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  I MOVE up and down obedient to the impulse of my passion  I am now in London attending the sick chamber of Emma into which I gain access only by virtue of my profession Her affection preys fast upon her health Yet it becomes her age and its object is amiable It is an affection which nature virtue and religion conjoin to make respectable Youth gives it a new charm Misfortune throws over it a tender and interesting shade Sickness adorns it with peculiar softness and absence  assists sensibility in rendering the whole more touching  Such is the love of Emma while  mine  is the passion of a man who hovers round the idol of his heart with the most doating fondness at the time that he is convinced of the folly and impropriety  In vain Frederick you ridicule invite and advise I cannot quit Emma She is sick and I am wretched She loves another and it does not relax the diligent attentions I pay to her virtue and her beauty She has fallen in the path of my life and I make a dead stop I cannot  passion Sneer not jest not but pity my sensibility and if you choose to call it by a more censurable name whatsoever it be  pity me by that  I am trying to recover myself but make no progress To speak the truth I undertake the business with reluctance and cannot expect to succeed in it  Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER LXXXII  TO EMMA CORBETT  There will be no occasion my beloved girl to use any longer the fortunes of a daughter or a friend I still have a succedaneum in the care of Providence who has in some measure repaired the depredations of war  Your cousin Fanshaw is just dead and though he would suffer neither of us to approach him while living how inconsistent has at length made his will in my favour annexing this remarkable codicil "To Charles Corbett ten thousand pounds because I hear he is a sufferer by the  war with  America  and to Emma Corbett his daughter whose fortune must of course be lessened by the same means five thousand pounds provided she  does not marry an officer or any person concerned in promoting the contest"  AdieuLet these tidings revive you  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER LXXXIII  TO C CORBETT ESQ  BLESSED be the memory of the man whose generosity has taken such a load from my heart Yes my dear and venerable father I  am  revived Sickness and sorrow stand suspended at your tidings We have now sufficient to gratify every wish that contented natures can form I had been casting about for means to seduce you into accepting my freewill offering or tendernessmy mite of duty but my perplexity is relieved Ten thousand pounds will gild the evening of a virtuous life and three are competent to all the wants of  EMMA  LETTER LXXXIV  TO LOUISA CORBETT  THIS yetcontinued delay terrifies me Oh what minutes have I told overwhat days and weeks have I pass'd▪  I conjure you to let Roberts purchase all the papers he can collect for a month back and send them without loss of time to the trembling  EMMA  LETTER LXXXV  TO EMMA CORBETT  THREE  thousand pounds my sweet daughter why that which is properly your  own  independence is now  eight  thousand How could you congratulate  me  and forget to felicitate  yourself  But you generously annihilated the latter consideration in reflecting upon the first Such is the noble negligence of your nature I must assist you too in observing that the barriers of graceful pride are now thrown down and the avenue open clear and unobstructed to any tender partiality which you suppose may gratify the expectations of your most affectionate father  C CORBETT  LETTER LXXXVI  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I WILL not affect to misconceive you my only parent You seem constantly anxious to connect me with some worthy man as the associate of my life yet do not recollect that my choice is made my principles fixed and my heart  inalienably  engaged An unsubdued veneration for truth attends me I caught the inspiring affection I bear her from the respectable authors of my being It is a prejudice as early as it is amiable and you should not wonder if I walk steadily in the way of my directors This sir I have often told you I have been brought up to consider the happiness  of life not as deducible from the maxims of the world but from implicit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has seated upon the throne of the soul as an unerring judge in all cases of moral arbitration It has been a hard task for me to struggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our house and though the burst of nature has sometimes broken unawares it was not in  those  seasons that I was the most unhappy When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me when I sought the silent corner and could secretly commune with my own heart and enter into all its inclinings then  then  my father it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedness came over her  for she found it impossible to wean her affections from an object one so entirely and with so good reason approved and now so entirely and you will pardon me without any solid reasons rejected I have not at this period my dearest father collection of mind enough for much argument but you will please to recollect that it was you who first kindled the sparks of tenderness for Henry Besides that we were brought up together when gentle impressions are easily admitted and unreservedly avowed you represented him as an orphan of honour talents and goodsense I depend on every thing you say and was charmed with a sentiment correspondent to my own The affection was full grown  and had expanded into blossom ere you attempted to destroy or even to check it Then  all at once  you said you had your reasons which to this hour remain partly unexplained to desire I would think no more of Henry Hammond yet you averred it was not fortune nor any other circumstance relating to what the world calls  a good match  that created a change in your esteem Want of  worth  I am sure it  could  not be and yet you still persist to dissuade me from attaching myself to merit elegance and virtue  I am glad this method of addressing each other by letter though in the same house has by accident been adopted It appeared awkward at  first but hath now the familiarity of a habit It may well be said in  my  case "to excuse the blush and pour out all the heart" Yet wherefore do I talk of blushing Surely it is not necessary I yield not to any romantic pomps of passion I make it not a subject where it can be likely to create one discordant feeling I love with simplicity and truth and it is far beyond my powerfar even as the preservation of a solemn vow is from the breach of it to change my object but with a change of its purity The oaths that are taken at the altar sir may  ratify  tenderness but cannot  create  it and amongst the sordid connections of men it is not uncommon to be invested with the public sanction without  ever receiving a private assent from the understanding or the heart I do not think the law of the land of itself sufficient to make a woman happy Marriage is a very honourable but it may be a very miserable institution that is it may produce misery while it confers honour The  ceremony  is only the  seal  of mutual love but the  bond  should be made before and in point of attachment I hold myself at this moment as religiously united to Henry as if all the forms of the earth had passed my lips in confirmation The same idea will be lodged in my bosom whether that confirmation be remote or near It is not intended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only It is to last for life  It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure and nothing but death is to extinguish it Thus contracted my father in spirit and in truth you will easily judge how light must be the sacrifice of my cousin's strange legacy The  political  tenets of Mr Hammond have nothing to do with my friendship for him As they have carried him into a dangerous path of life far from  me  I so far deplore them I chose not the  officer  but the  man  and though it is alas but too unlikely that our  personal  interests should be made  one  yet the union of our souls is too sincere and too strong for five and twenty times the conditional five thousand pounds  to loosen or dissolve I felt myself about to declare that not  any  earthly motive could induce me to embrace this gorgeous bribe but I am suddenly checked and find upon scrutiny into this filial bosom O my dear  dear  father that  one  motive and  only one  there  might  have been which could make your Emma  the victim of money  Had the late convulsions of fortune remained in their full forcehad it pleased God to  increase  their violence had all that could have been raised by the aids of property and industry proved insufficientand had those venerable hairs been  indeed  consigned to sorrow and none but a  daughter  's duteous  hand to help a parent's poverty in that dire case my beloved father if you have a true sense of my nature you will guess what I should have been tempted to do I should have accepted the conditions in the codicil and secured to my father a resource from indigence at a time of his life when humanity is the least able to bear it I would  not  then have "marred an officer engaged in the national contest" Yet even  then  my affection would remain though its  timate views would be changed  In the private recesses of my soul the image of Henry would still be engraved and although I sacrificed all  that was possible or necessary to duty it would be long very long ere I could withdrawthat chaste and channing sentiment which gives me in all transitions a title to esteemah more than esteemto  love    him tenderly  EMMA  LETTER LXXXVII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  At NewYork Boston or elsewhere in the army of General in America  OH Henry I can bear it no longer Heaven knows where you may be at this moment Heaven knows whether you exist My alarm is extreme I hazard the fate of a few lines If they reach you relate your situation relate your disasters Do not torturedo not kill me but seize the first instant to quiet the terrors of my heart You do not Knew what I am enduring for your dear sake You do not know what domestic calamities have been heaped upon the anguish which seemed to  admit no exaggeration Not one moment's peace not one moment's health shall I know till I hear from you  Hear from you Perhaps alas even while I writeperhaps some savage hand  Oh Henry Henryto love virtuously constantly and entirelyto know the full  value  and the full  danger  of the beloved objectto  wish  information yet  dread  to hear it is it oh is it amongst the supremest of curses or of blessings  EMMA  LETTER LXXXVIII  TO HENRY HAMMOND ESQ  ALTHOUGH I have a letter now tossing with the sea and know it must be many a day upon its perturbed bosom ere it gets to hand yet I again have taken up the pen with increase of terror and if it were possible of tenderness I am ill and they will not suffer me to quit my chamber They want to deny me the use of the only instruments which can even have a chance of conveying to you the state of my heart They tell me it is dangerous How I despise their pedantry I want not to be taught the  theory  of patience I have  prattifed  it long But horrors  too great for patience itself at length invade me Oh by the agony which you cause and by all the dreadsul nights and days that you make me suffer  respect my misfortunes  Relieve recompense and redress them One page one line one sentence will suffice Say but that all is wellsay that you breathe and I will be again composed Oh Mr Hammond wheresoever you are or whatever has befallen you if there has been a possibility of sending to me you  should  in pity to the condition of my mind you  ought  to have remembered me Unlesswhich heaven avertahI will not suffer myself to rest amoment on such a horrid thoughtand yet this suspensethis agonizing suspense  presents nothing but images the most dire Tell me explicitly fully circumstantially I conjure I  insist  that you let me know every thing without disguise without delay Alas how I write onhow I rave But I will be very calm indeed I will I will endeavour to fit my mind for every stroke but  Oh Hammond Hammond what a wretch have you made

well Behold the inclosed Sanctify it with a sister's kiss but oh erase not those which Emma has impressed on every line It is dated at sea but the intelligence chears me I trust in Providence and am most happy Receive my treasure but keep it not beyond the returning of the post  So  long I part from this dear associate of my pillow in love to thee thou sister of Henry I cannot sleep while it is out  of my possession It is an instance of my friendship which surpasses all common bounds My fever abates my pulses resume a wholsome measure Hope is busy in every vein I can bear the visitation of the sunbeam and will now retire to rest softly supplicating that Power which alone can relieve me to continue the bounty he has begun  Adieu  EMMA  LETTER XC  TO EMMA CORBETT  The inclosure from Mr Hammond  AT length my beloved friend an opportunity presents itself I had prepared a large pacquet against this dear chance but it was filled with gloom despondence and images of severe distress  Better prospects  appear and I have buried my ill news in the ocean We are joined by ships which are freighted with large and liberal offers of  conciliation  They are formed methinks to suit the ambitious and grasping spirit even of an American and they must I think be accepted Once more regulated by maternal laws the wayward child  shall again prosper The treasures of either hemisphere shall again be shared The arms of a great nation shall no longer be employed to annoy but to defend Our refractory fellowsubjects shall soften into their former sentiments I am now Emma within sight of the land Reconciliation is expanding her angel plumes before us and my presence will I trust be no further necessary than as it will give me an opportunity to  witness  the joy when a truant child is restored to the protection of an offended parent GreatBritain all insulted as she is ineffective as have been her affectionate advances and scorned as have been her professed kindness shall receive with transport her America  The temporary estrangement shall only serve like the quarrel of friends to brighten the bonds of future amity  O PEACE thou image of Divinity itselfdescend oh descend upon  that earth  from whence the mistakes of altercating relations have so long affrighted thee Melt the hearts of contending countrymen and shape every jarring interest they maintain all all confess thy celestial sway Subdue gentlest power the fierce soul of ambition soften the sinews of authority and let the countenance of offended Majesty share the tenderness of a fatherah come I implore thee and come without delay Let not  Henry fight against the cause for which Edward fell Let there be no longer cause to fight Expand thy snowy wing over the same peoplereplace brother in the embraces of brother and friend in the foldings of friend Let a soldier in  this  instance supplicate thee to sheathe the sword Reserve his arm for the  natural  enemies of his country and make it not a duty to go forth against a  civil  foe I address thee O loveliest O divine spirit of Peàce in the name of all the dear and delicate affectionsaffections which make up thy enchanting train I call upon thee in the names of nature reason humanity and good saithin the names of father child and all connections that are most precious  I call in the names of Emma and Louisa My invocation can ascend no higher nor can  Hahsoft soft my Emmamethinks the invocation is heard The courted Deity descends in all the benignity of her brightness She is surrounded with sunbeams softened by tender fleecings of sky which form her chariot The eternal olive mixes in the ray which waves over the turrets of the western world War is disarmed The horrid parent of fetters is  himself  in chains He sullenly yields his giant limbs He is bound as a prisoner and the victory is given to nature and to peace  Oh what a lucid throng comes forward as incident to the conquest The Arts revive The Muses confess the triumph of the Affections with a song Vegetation though lately trampled down springs up and freshens under the feet of Industry and Repose who both assist the general restoration of their flowery realms The sacred power of  Friendship  regains his station in the human mind The tender power of  Love  reascends his throne and stretches his roseat sceptre over the human heart The trembling maidsthe  Emmas  which

promiseand oh what sweet and affecting pleasure it affords me while I am writing this the barks of fair proposal making the be  t of their way before me I anticipate the transport with which my tidings will be receivedand imagine the effect they will have on the exaclest form and most touching features my eyes ever beheld I see methinks  the soft tear of genuine joy course along the cheek or bathing the crystal that covers my portraitthe invisible sigh steals through its vermeil passagesthe rosy gates of life and love are opened to welcome the news and balmily breathe over it a tender aspiration  Adieu Adieu the pacquets are ready I am in hope I am in heaven  Adieu  HENRY HAMMOND  LETTER XCI  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  AFORTUNATE change has happened Frederick in this family since my last Emma is all rapture and all health She has heard from Henry Hammond and the effect of this intelligence  writes triumphant low  upon every feature Her languor is gone Her tears stream from  bappiness  only She sighs with bliss  Upon my entering the room about an hour ago she caught hold of my hand and as I was about feeling her pulse exclaimed"O Sir Robert the panacea is arrived I am well I am happy"  By my soul Frederick her joy and her sorrow are alike amiable and though both are to me as adverse winds yet the more she distresses me the more I love her  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XCII  TO LOUISA CORBETT  O Good God who shall presume to fathom the depths of human misery when it is thy will to exercise the chastening rod The felicity so lately brought me was as the lightning before the storm and only announced its approach The thunderbolt has at length fallen to crush the most unfortunate  EMMA CORBETT  LETTER XCIII  TO EMMA CORBETT  IS he then dead  is  he  too numbered with the slain and hath the noble youth so  soon  followed the lovely Edward Alas I suspected this even while your letter of fairer information lay before me In vain expectance of finding something that relates to the sate of my husband even against the convictions I have of his death I fondly examine every paper and public print relating to the war that falls in my way In the Gazette of last night I perceive there has been an engagement and  read with streaming eyes an account of the wounded and the slain Yet are you  sure  of your intelligence  I hope it is in part illfounded for I perceive not the name of Hammond in either list An Ensign  Haddock  and a Captain  Hammerson  are mentioned amongst the  wounded  but these do not approach very near even in sound I will enquire farther immediately mean time hopehope every thing dearest friend My brotheroh noI will not have it so  LOUISA CORBETT  LETTER XCIV  TO LOUISA CORBETT  THE  Gazette flain wounded  Oh I had no conception to what an extreme of misery I was reserved You have mistaken me but of what dire information has that mistake been productive There  has  then been an engagement You have seen the bloody list It must have been  purposely  concealed from me The skirmish you say was sudden You read of a Captain  Hammerson  In the hurry of war it is easy to drop one syllabie or to add another These conflicts are too great  The inclosed will shew you that the wounds of Henry need not have been subjoined to the violence of a parent blinded by the rage of hydra  party  The  wounds  of Henry did I sayO holdhold my heart I cannot bear itindeed I cannot  Adieu I will think upon a remedy  Adieu  EMMA  LETTER XCV  TO EMMA CORBETT  EMMA be yourself You  must  make one generous effort I see you languishing under my eye and canot bear it Thrice have I seen you in the sick chamber within a few weeks It is easy to perceive that your whole soul is pining after Henrythe  perfidious  Henry with whom your union  must never be  while you think proper to own a  father  and accept his  protection  I tell thee Emma that were he this moment  returned  and returned with what degenerate Britons  now  call  glory  nay could he lay the conquest of the plundered colonies at  thy feet  there exists a reason  which would make it vileyes mark the strength of the termVILE in  Emma Corbett  to accept it But I see nothing less than the entire explanation of the fact will convince thee To crush therefore every lingering hope at once know thou dear infatuated thy father still leans his very soul on the welfare of America Those fortunes which have been destroyed those debts which have impoverished me as well as those ample streams of commerce which rolled unobstructed from shore to shore were  l dedicated to injured America For  thy brother's blood was shed and had I yet more sons more fortunes and more resources they should all be at the service of that violated country  She is injuredshe is aggrieved my daughter Her oppressions are at my heartThe strings that fix it to my bosom are trembling for herShe glows with a generous love of freedomShe has been condemned without a hearingShe was stabbed into resistanceThe sword was held to her throat ere she thought of selfdefence Conflagration famine and parricide have entered her late peaceful habitationsThe common bounties of Providence have been denied herThe blood of citizens of brothers and of friends are flowing in rivers through her streets  I have not Emma been one of those who hawk about my principles  and saunter in babbling ignorance from coffeehouse to coffeehouse I am  fixed  in  my  politicks and think my steady adherence to them a part of my  religion  Since we are cruelly taught to make a sanguinary mark of distinction betwixt an Englishman and and an American I own myself the latter and deplore the infirmities that prevent me from rushing to the field My child my child I know the ruinous rapacity the murder the VIILAINY of this unnatural war I enter deeply and pathetically into every wrong which America sustains It is the only point wherein I am enthusiastic and it is the only point where enthusiam is great and glorious Do not imagine rash girlmonstrous  thoughtdo not DARE to imagine ungrateful Henry shall ever receive the hand of Emma Spare me beloved daughter in this one partthis sore this tender partand in every  other  command your father You owe me this submission you owe me this FAVOUR this  indulgence  I would have preserved your Hammond and opposed his entering into this wicked employment but it was impossible High of heart he scorned to be even  tenderly  controuled I endeavoured to win him generously over to an honourable cause He called it insult bribery baseness The military distraction was throbbing in every vein When I argued he justified every measure of ministry  GreatBritain  he said was grossly abusedher lenity scornedher laws defiedher sublime prerogative contemptuously set at nought He spoke loud and vehement of American  rebellion  The honour of the empire he said now depended on the exertion of each individual and it was the duty of every young man whom every tie of interest every bond of loyalty and every principle of policy called upon to manifest his zeal his courage and his attachment He went on my child in all the foaming folly of youth declaring that he should account himself base were he to deny the  contribution  of his arm The greater his love for  Emma  the nobler his  sacrifice  he said He was determined he had made up  his mind and was resolved to defend his country or gloriously perish in her ruins I pitied his delirium yet venerated his ardour Well directed of what was it not susceptible He was above admonition and kept erring on In true tenderness to thee my Emma I forgot the dignity of age and even stooped to intercede After all my letters to him were in vain I privately sought a personal interview but his boiling spirit took fire I reluctantly withdrew and gave up the point  Oh America thou bleeding innocent how art thou laden with oppressions Oh my child my child Nature Religion and Religion's  God  are on her side and will you take to your arms and to your embraces a youth who propensely  violates  these a cruel youth whose reeking blade may at this moment smoke with kindred gore Tyranny hath not a reserve of barbarity in store She is exhausted Your Henry is a  volunteer  amongst those who as an acquisition to the British army have added the tomahawk the hatchet and the scalping knife And will the tenderhearted Emma continue to love such a barbarian Away away it will not bear a thought Banish obliviate  detest  him He is in open rebellion against the  laws of nature  Let your affections flow into a fairer channel  ah suffer a parent's hand to pilot them He has a  friend  in reserve my dear  such  a friend  But tell me that you have  resumed yourself  Tell me that you are  indeed  my daughter  Adieu  CHARLES CORBETT  LETTER XCVI  TO FREDERICK BERKLEY ESQ  I WILL withdraw my foolish self from this  illstarred attempt  Go down to Castleberry and I will meet you there without delay  The perplexity of interests in this family where each part opposes the other and where still greater entanglement is promised are really too many for  me  who have made a sudden transition from quietness to agitation  You cannot reprobate my weakness in a keener style of censure than I myself do Oh I know full well the  unfitness of such storms to the sober season of my life I conceal the cause from all but you and your reproof shews me how little mercy I might expect were that cause imparted to less generous hearts  The matter grows too interesting A certain darling passion which scarce confines Corbett on this side phrenzy and the avowed preengagements of Emma which are more than barriers of iron against me unite to point at the necessity of retreat  Expect  me therefore and when we are together prepare yourself with subject of conversation which indeed may take any turn but that of my  infirmity  all men who are  conscious  they possess any  proscribe this In happiness and in misery Frederick we have a few grains of selflove and while all its proud associates croud about us we suffer no theme to be discussed that can humiliate us to ourselves  Your's ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XCVII  TO THE SAME  STOP stop dear friend Visit not Castleberry yet I have twice attempted to take leave and twice failedtwice packed and twice unpacked my portmanteautwice ordered my servant to get horses and twice pretended to be weatherwise and as an excuse for  changing my mind  have prophesied a  change of atmosphere  In the noontide brightness of the sun I have predicted storms and hurricanes and it is in vain the fellow casts his eye to the heavens and declares that the weather is fixed It is his master alas and not the air which is unsettled  A little delay can make no difference Indulge me Humour me  Within a post or two I will decide and decide too as you and as  common sense  demands of me  Farewell  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XCVIII  TO THE SAME  I COME my dear Frederick I come The confusion of the Corbettsthe absurd yet afflicting emotions of my own heartthethetheIn shortI set out tomorrow  Adieu  ROBERT RAYMOND  LETTER XCIX  TO C CORBETT ESQ  I HAVE a suspicion that Mr Hammond is wounded let that circumstance oh my father account to you for the horrors of mind which have for some days locked up every power of hand and of voice The former faculty is in some measure restored so far at least as tremblingly to trace upon paper something like an answer to your affecting favour every syllable of which is as an envenomed arrow fixing in my bosom Your determined objection then to poor Henry is at last accounted for I thought the sanguine track of party was washed wholly from a father's heart by the  blood of my brother Shall political prejudices interrupt the finest affections of humanity Horrid is the aspect of battle view it on either side It cannot shift to an attitude nor take  one position  to soften its terrors upon the reflecting  mind  To THAT it is uniformly odious nor is it at all amended by considering that as it began soon after the  creation  it will scarcely end till the  destruction  of the world It has even within the narrow precincts of  our  family divided the son from the father and the lover from his mistress let it not be rendered  more  dire by setting the interest of the daughter against that of her most honoured parent since  that  would be to encourage the madness of mortals  and the civil pestilence that in the form of a  familywar  is gone forth against us It would violate the gentle laws of nature and tear down those conciliating ties which fasten  kindred  in one vast chain of connexion ample as earth and beautiful as heaven You have painted your own patriotism and that of Henry sir with equal vigour of language at least you have said enough either way to prove that  both  fancy the  cause adopted  is the cause of rectitude and glory When one side attacks the other must naturally defend on which account while the spirit of contention remains some will vehemently censure the very measures which some as vehemently applaud But in avowing your own enthusiasm  my dear father do you not in effect justify that of Henry You both seem to hug to your bosoms a political Cleopatra for whose sake you are willing to gain or to lose a world England is to Henry what America is to you Each insists that he is espousing the cause of an injured friend and while this is the case how can it be expected that  either  should yield In fact would not such a concession according to the prescriptions of  honour  in this world's acceptation of the word be accounted base You have you say attempted to direct the sword of Henry on the better side of the dispute  Which  is that better side Henry declares for Britain you for America What third person shall  decide between you The feeble voice of a woman will neither be heard or admitted Else might she venture to assert that your countrymen are bleeding abroad while the point of right and wrong is adjusting at home This however is clear my dear father from your own premises if Henry thought himself insulted by the proposal of changing his side  you  would have been no less stung had a similar proposition come from  him  to  you  And this proves that both are acting on what is called patriotic principle What right reason then has the one to be displeased with the other Yet upon this displeasure on your part you urge me to withdraw my vows Are then virtuous resolutions  so to be withdrawn my father When affection is fashioned by the feelings and long cherished in a soul which neither projects nor practises any ill whose every thought is submitted to the holy criticism of Heaven nor ever dreads the scrutinyis it under these circumstances of a texture so convenient as to shift from object to object with every gale of opinion and move away at the word of command Wherefore let me once again tenderly enquire wherefore did you originally inspire me with a veneration for sober reason why infuse in me a steady and generous way of thinking Was it designed for ornament or for use If not intended as the  governing rule of conduct  through every meander of this mortal pilgrimage oh wherefore did you not at  first  even in the nursery while every power was impressive and would have taken the form you chose to give itwherefore  then  did you not lead me into the path that I was to tread without stop or turning Alas you have given me fixed principles acknowledged they were good saw them with joy take root in my heart and now you expect in their fullest growth and finest foliage that they should suddenly perish But the habits of my youth are grown so strong that I feel it is too late for me to deal in disguises I will not now begin an artificial character Oh suffer me to implore you sir to continue  my attachment to Truth and Nature I know nothing of state wrangles or Congress quarrels I mix not with the infuriate errors of party I only act up to those simple principles of moral life which assure me that constancy in favour of  a known valuable object  not obstinate predilection to a  bad one  is the basis on which the superstructure of all that is noble just and good must be raised My wisdom is extremely limited It stretches not into those maxims which desolate the earth for a vapour of victory nor does it presume to penetrate the wiles of government All it  does  pretend to belongs to that small and dear system in which every woman ought to be instructed namely that a  wellfixed  tenderness  should never be removed that it should brave the storms of fortune and distress that while life remains it should be the animating  purpose  of life to  cultivate  it and that death and death  only  should dissolve the bonds which virtue had made If my beloved father would for one moment lay the clamorous contentions of a bickering species aside and submit to be charmed by that dispassionate power which decides calmly of truth and falshood he would be convinced of this I am sure he would for his nature is gentle and his heart is soft Ah think what a task it is for your soulsick Emma to be under the necessity of using these pleadings at  such a time  Come to her bed side  perhaps the cause of  our  disputes may now  Oh for pity my father hasten to meaid me in this dreadful conflictrescue me from myselfwipe away the bitterest tear that anguish ever drew from the heart of a daughter and recover me ere it be yet too late from the arms of death  EMMA  END OF THE
