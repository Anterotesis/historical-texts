Country and Benevolence to the whole Race of Mankind Had I known a truer Friend to  Christianity  in General or to the  Church  in Particular your  Lordship  had not been troubled with this  Address  nor with the Protection of this Work which is design'd for the  Cure    Relief  or  Entertainment  of the Valetudinary Weak and Diseas'd in  Body  or  Mind  Your  Lordship  's natural and acquir'd  Endowments  enable  You to judge  solidly  how well it may be fitted for that  End Good Lady  HUNTINGDON I believe has benefited by some of the Rules for Health laid down in this Treatise as have some others of the Branches of your  Noble Family  Lady  Betty  's eminent  Christian  Virtues are not only universally admir'd but  felt  These Considerations make this Work your  Lordship  's peculiar  Property  and I am greatly pleased with an Opportunity publickly to declare the  Honour  and  Esteem  I have for the Family of the HASTEINGS and in particular how deeply I am  My LORD  Your Lordship's most faithful humble Servant GEO CHEYNE  Bath  Aug  THE PREFACE  THE following  Essay  was written to instruct all sober and serious Persons how to preserve or regain their Health but chiefly to direct and relieve my  Fellowsufferers  the  Scorbutic    Gouty    Consumptive  or  Nervous  Valetudinarianlowlivers to make them pass their Lives the most comfortably the  Degree  of their Distempers the  Time  of Life the  Nature  of Things and the secret Orders of  Providence  will permit And since they must be deprived in some Degree of the  grosser  sensual Pleasures since all sentient and  intelligent  Beings are made for Happiness will by mere  Instinct  seek it  somehow  and somewhere since their necessary  Lowliving  will naturally  in time at least make them  highspirited  and their  intellectual Organs  more acute  penetrating  and  delicate  I have endeavour'd by the following  Discourses  to supply them with some suitable  Entertainments  and  Amusements  such as I have often agreeably diverted my leisure Hours with    True Philosophy  is the  Science  of living the most happily through the whole  Period  of our Existence the Nature of things will permit  Physic  is but one Branch of this  Philosophy  and regards but one part of our Composition and but for a small  Period  of our Duration  True Philosophy  takes in the whole Extent of our Being from its most distant Beginning to its most advanced Stages possible or conceiveable True Physic is that only which directs how the Body may be preserved the most  healthful  the intellectual Organs depending on the Body the most acute the  Senses  the most perfect and the  Limbs  the most  active not for a while only and by Fits and Starts but uniformly as long as  they  were made to last and as the  original  Frame and Texture will permit Any thing less than this is but as a Part to the Whole an imperfect and unfinish'd  Sketch  of such a  Philosophy  and such a  Physic  their Theory and  Principles  was intended by the following  Essay  and  Discourses  They were composed at different Times and on different Occasions but one general  Scheme  and one manner of  free philosophizing  and  easy Conjecturing  runs through them all one to wit where the fundamental  Truth  or  Proposition  in general is suppos'd either  allow'd    reveal'd  or already  demonstrated  But the  Why  the  final Causes  the  moral Consequences  and the particular  Detail  is only here conjectured about from probable or  philosophic Principles  This necessarily makes them more  loose    unguarded  and  immethodical  and the  same things to be often repeated But I had neither  Leisure    Relish  nor  Strength of Application  to remedy these Faults it would have cost me more  Trouble  than the first  Composure  All I could obtain of myself was to make a short more distinct  Abstract  of the whole and join a few  Explications  to prevent  Cavil  and all  Mistakes  not wilful and disingenuous if possible  I am very sensible by this Work I shall make myself obnoxious to two very different kinds of Men the  Stiff    Rigid  and  Precise  and the  Licentious    Unguarded    Spurious    FreeThinkers  The  first  very probably will censure my  Conjectures  and  Sentiments  as  dangerous  and  presumptuous  and  myself  as being  wise above what is written  and arrogantly prying into the  Secrets  of infinit Wisdom It is very possible I may have been  faulty  in this particular I am sensible that some even undoubted  Truths  that may hurt the  Weak  ought to be concealed  or enjoy'd only in secret the same Degrees of  Light  not being equally  luminous  and  perceptive  to all Eyes But since  old Men  and Valetudinarians especially become as it were  Children  a second time and in their  second Childhood    those  must have their  Rattles  as well as these I thought it safer as I am sure it is much more entertaining to play with  Ideas    philosophic Conjectures  and such  Amusements  how weakly soever founded as tend to make  Virtue  and its  Source  amiable justify the  Conduct of Providence  and mend and rejoice the  Heart  without hurting the  Head  than to dwell on the dark Side of Things that lead to  Pyrrhonism    Fatalism    Infidelity  and  Despair  If I thought I had advanced any thing  derogatory  from the  Amiableness  of infinit Perfection  contrary  to the Doctrine of the earliest and purest Times of  Christianity    contradictory  to the  Analogy  of Faith and the  Form of sound Words  I had committed these  Sheets  to the  Flames  with the  Hand  of their  Author    before I had published them But on the contrary I hoped they might agreeably entertain my  Valetudinarian  who being placed by his low Health in the  middle State  between both  Worlds  the  old  and the  new  must unavoidably at some times  figure  to himself some sort of a  Map  of the next World I was therefore willing to try to  illuminat  it the best I could and to trace some of the  Outlines  of the  Passages  from  this  to  that Mansion  by endeavouring to  illustrat  from not so common a Set of  Principles  and  Philosophy  some great and fundamental  Truths  establish'd on more  popular Proofs  viz that there is no Possibility of Happiness here or hereafter without  Purity  of  Heart  and  Life  and that the true  Reason  of the present  Darkness  both in  Providence  and  Revelation  is the Difficulty of recovering this  Purity of Heart and Life  to its utmost Perfection in free  lapsed  Intelligences consistent with their  Liberty  and the  Harmony  of the Divine Attributes  which infinit  Power  and  Wisdom  will not I might say cannot counter act  I apprehend less Quarter from the opposit  Set  of Men who may honour me with  Enthusiasm    Romanceing  and  Castlebuilding  without any solid Foundation All I have to say is that perhaps my Manner of explaining some great and fundamental Truths and a few of the Consequences I draw by my  Method  may be defective And perhaps from some of the  Links  being dropt and from Faults in the  wording  the  Chain  of the Reasoning may not be always  clear  and  strong  but I am sure the  Foundation  is  solid  and  just  and allow'd to be such by all  true Philosophers  and without it all  general  and  abstracted  Reasoning on these  imperceptible  Subjects must be vain I mean without admitting  Analogy  For without supposing the Evidence and Probability of it it being in  Things  only what  Proportion  is in  Numbers  and its  Progressions  being only  like the higher and subsequent Terms of a  Series  in  Algebra  from some of the first and simplest  Terms  being given no  general Laws  nor  universal Propositions  can be found out in  Mathematicks    Philosophy  or  Morality  For  Induction  either in  Experiment    Observation  or  Calculation  must be always  particular  and limited Perhaps the  Method  when managed by a  clearer Head  and a more  solid Judgment  may become a noble  Source  of  divine Knowledge  and a  sublime Philosophy Mathematicians  well know that there are several different  Methods  of investigating the same Propositions in  Algebra  and  Geometry  and there is scarce a  Geometer  but has his own  Method  of  Investigation  The same Conclusions drawn from different demonstrated  Truths  give a sensible  Pleasure  and a stronger  Conviction  to an honest Heart and a Lover of Truth and I could not but be delighted with the  Universality    Simplicity  and  Luminousness  of the  Method  of  Analogy  and the other Principles I have laid down in the following  Discourses  not having met with an  Objection    Difficulty  or even a  Puzzle  almost in  Nature    Providence  or  Revelation  which had not an easy consequential or probable Solution from them which is at least a Prejudice in their Favour I had nothing to do but to try the  Difficulty  in its most simple and obvious Cases as I used to do in  Algebra  to find out  universal Canons  and attentively to observe the Conditions of the  Progression  till the higher Terms involved the Complication  There are some Persons made so by  Nature  that they are  slow    dark    gloomy    joyless    puzzling  and  perplexing  and they pass for the wise prudent guarded Men of the  World  They may attack  Error  but seldom find out  Truth  by themselves like the  Scuttlefish  they spout out their own  black Liquor  on the  pellucid Element  If they are  honest  and  sincere  they are much to be pitied and are to be treated with  Humanity  and  Charity  being in the State of those born  poor  and  blind  and so destitute of the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life They must do the best they can and be charitably supplied and with Docility be willing to be led by others and thus tho' their Trial might be  hard  and  severe  yet their Victory would be  meritorious  and  glorious  But on the contrary it often happens that  Licentiousness    Selfsufficiency  and a supercilious Contempt of others are the true Causes of their  Darkness  and  Indigence  and that they have themselves by wrong or no Culture stunted the  Organs  of their Faculties and by a perpetual  Malregimen  have distorted them  I take  common Happiness  in our natural State at present to lie in the Pursuit of the general Measures of Thinking Acting and Living follow'd by the greatest part of the middling Rank of  our  Species  as it is in their Order in other  Animals  and  common Sense  as it is distinguished from cultivated and refin'd Sense to lie in assenting and conforming to the  Truths  and  Manners  agreed upon explicitly or implicitly in the  Community  where Providence has placed us without some  irresistible  that is  miraculous  Evidence or a  peaceable    silent  and not  intermeddling  Selfconviction to the contrary And he who pretends to be  happy  as to his outward Circumstances out of  common Life  or  wise  as to intellectual Endowments out of  common Sense  in Things on a Level with his  Occupation  and  Education  I take him always to labour under some undiscover'd  chronical nervous  Distemper be the other Appearances what they will and have been seldom mistaken in a  particular Case  For tho' a  sound Mind  be not the  only  sure Evidence of a  sound Body  yet it will always shew that none of the great  Organs  of Life is intirely spoilt or greatly  damaged  however tender and  delicate they may be It is more difficult than perhaps most Men are aware of to determin with any Degree of Exactness the  Limits  that separat  Wisdom  from  Folly    Wrongheadedness  from  intellectual Sanity  the most perfect Man here has a  Mixture  of both  Optimus ille    qui minimis urgetur  Certain it is that  true Wisdom  and a  sound Mind  consists in first  pondering  and then  doing  every thing as near as we can with  Order    Number    Weight  and  Measure  But since  Precision  is incompatible with  Finitude  if we endeavour to be constantly  progressive  towards Perfection tho' by gentle Steps neither stopping nor turning aside but doing the best we can without  Scrupulosity  and generously hopeing and believeing that infinit Wisdom and Goodness has or will supply the  rest  in his own Time and Manner  we cannot fail  Were I to  choose  for myself considering the many certain  Miseries  and  Temptations of this State of  Probation  the  few  uncertain  Antidotes  and much  fewer  sincere durable and real  Pleasures  I had much rather have the weaker than the stronger  System  of Nerves within the  Extremes  I had rather choose to be contented with the  slight  and  slender  than covet the strong and  pungent  Pleasures I had rather be happy in a  Dream  than miserable  awake  In a word I had rather choose to be an innocent benevolent tho' weaker and more  credulous  Person than a  malicious    critical    spurious Freethinker  even with regard to this Life only They most certainly are  comparatively    unhappy  and  joyless  in themseves and are  unharmoniously  fram'd in  Body  as well as  Mind  who can delight and employ their  Talents  on throwing  Darkness  and  Doubts  even on the imaginary Happiness suppose it such of their  FellowCreatures  Nothing but  Rancour  and  acrid Juices  could be pleased with tearing and destroying  Childrens  Playthings  and the wisest Man here is comparatively but a  Child  As to myself I can  honestly affirm  I have had but  one  uniform manner of thinking in  Philosophy    Physic  and  Divinity  in the main ever since my Thoughts were  fix'd  and my Principles  establish'd  They may have had  Alternatives  of greater  Light  and  Darkness  occasionally and transiently according to the  State  of my  Spirits    Knowledge  and  Experience  but in the  Heart of my Soul  so to speak I have been uniform and under the same  Convictions  as to the  Fundamentals  of these  Sciences  and always thought  spurious FreeThinkers    active Latitudinarians  and  Apostolic Infidels  it being a Contradiction they can be certain in their  Negative  Opinions or by them when propagated should do any Good to their FellowCreatures but an infinit deal of Hurt under some obstinat bodily Distemper and much more proper Subjects for  Medicin  than  Argument  and that a  low Diet  long and obstinatly persisted in would at last cure both their Body and their Mind so far as it depends on the Body especially where Vice and Infidelity have not become habitual as they certainly have in old Sinners As I firmly believe and am as much convinced as I am of any natural Effect that Waterdrinking only will preserve all the Opulent healthy from every mortal Distemper bateing Accidents hereditary and epidemical Diseases and that a Diet of Milk and Seeds with Waterdrinking only duly continued and prudently managed with proper Evacuation Air and Exercise is the most infallible  Antidote  for all the obstinat Diseases of the Body and Distemperature of the Mind so far as it depends on the Body the present State of Things will permit and that it will cure every Disorder in the Body cureable and render the  Distemperature  of the Mind more tractable and that in all Events it will make both  more tolerable than they can possibly be otherwise This  Regimen  I have for these twenty Years first and last pursued and shall with the Divine Aid persist in it to my last Moments hitherto I thank GOD with as much Vivacity Health and Activity as can be expected at my time of Life under such a gouty scorbutic and nervous Habit The State of my Intellectuals will be best known by the following Discourses which were design'd to  illustrate  the  Principles    Theory  and  moral  Uses of  philosophical Medicin  The  practical Inferences  and the  Conclusions  drawn from them in particular Cases and Diseases confirm'd by forty Years Experience and Observation will follow in due Time in a Treatise intitled  The natural Method of Cure in the Diseases of the Body    and Distempers of the Mind thereon depending  if GOD shall see fit by the Preservation of my  Health  and  Faculties  THE General CONTENTS  A

   Order  and  Choice  fittest to preserve  HEALTH  prolong  LIFE  and produce equal good  SPIRITS  in Persons of all Ages and Constitutions  § THERE is not a more pernicious Error in  Physic  or one more opposit to the Expectation of Patients  viz  the Preservation or Recovery of their  Health  than that very common and universally received Opinion That there are  Bodies  in Nature or in the  Materia Medica  or such as may be found out by  Art  by dividing compounding or altering them by the  Tortures  of the  Fire  which will suddenly  or in any great Degree change or destroy the  Malignity  of the morbid  Humors  of  animal Bodies  or will intirely alter the Nature Qualities Figure Size and Laws of  Cohesion  of the  Particles  that compose their  Fluids  and  Solids  from an unsound and unhealthy State to one of a  kindly  and benign Nature a wild Notion at first introduc'd and propagated by  enthusiastical Chymists    Quacks  and  SymptomDoctors  An  animal  Body is nothing but a  Compages  or Contexture of Pipes an  hydraulic Machin  fill'd with a Liquor of such a Nature as was transfus'd into it by its  Parents  or is changed into by the  Nature  of the  Food  it is nourish'd with and is ever afterwards good bad or indifferent as these two Sources have sent it forth The  Primae Viae  or the  alimentary Tube  is as it were a  Common Sewer  may be foul'd or clean'd in various Manners and with great Facility it is wide open and reasonably strong in most  Animals  But from the  Intestines  into the  Habit  which only ought to be reckon'd the Body or the  Vehicle  of the  Soul  and into the  sanguiferous Tubes  into the  Glands  and  Bowels  the Passages from thence are so streight and narrow that they are but  infinitesimal Pores  rather than  Orifices    Strainers  and  Searches  rather than  Mouths  of  Tubes  and are scarce ever visible or perceptible in a healthy State and the Supply and Nutriture of the  Fluids  and  Solids  must pass under the  Form of a  Steam  or  Vapour  through them and not in the Form of a  Liquor  either for  Food  or  Physic  either to increase the Quantity or alter the Quality of the Blood and Juices and the  Solids  which  concentred    consolidated  and  condens'd  into their real or first  Formation Size  would not equal a  Grain  of  Sand  are permanent and dureable and continue pretty much in that State of  Elasticity  and Firmness they were first created with and they are strong or weak small or coarse  firm  or  lax  loose or  elastic  blunt or sharp as they were first made by the  supreme Artificer  or are alter'd somewhat by the original  Dyscrasy  or Distempers of the Parents the  Mother  can only mend or spoil their Juices which might be easily perfected by long Continuance in a  sweetening Diet  during their younger Days which if they survive they generally grow stronger as they grow older become the  Genii  and the Governors of the World because the  Solids  thus purified come from the  Father  alone and continue much the same all the Time of their Duration on this  Globe  except so far as the small  temporary  and  fugitive  Alteration that  Diet    Exercise  or  Evacuation  or mild ponderous Medicines long continued may make on them so small a Matter it really is that  Physic  or the  Materia Medica  can perform on the Habit on the  Solids  at least and yet it is only in and by them that  Health    long Life  and  Serenity  are to be had The most that  Physic  or  Physicians  can do is in and by the  Primae Viae  or alimentary Tube through these fine lacteal  Searches  into the  Habit  § WHAT is it then will it be said that  Art    Physic  or a  philosophic Physician  can truly do to relieve the Miseries Pains and Diseases of their  FellowCreatures  A great deal if judiciously and honestly directed and obstinatly and exactly pursued  viz  by mending the  Juices  in the Manner Nature the Distemper the Age and the Habitudes of the Patient point out  These  the Juices are the only things in an animal Body in the Power and under the Dominion of a  Physician  If the  principal Intentions  of the  Physician  be to mend the Blood and Juices  they  will in time and by the wise  Mechanism  of Nature rectify and confirm the  Solids  into their proper Situation and  Tone  for it is out of and by the Juices that the  Solids  are nourish'd figur'd and cloath'd  Air  and  Exercise  will give them the proper Firmness and Degree of  Elasticity  and then the  animal Functions  will be perform'd with Facility and Pleasure and thereby the Person will enjoy  Health  and  Serenity Art  can do nothing but remove Impediments resolve Obstructions cut off and tear away  Excrescences  and Superfluities and reduce Nature to its primitive Order and this only can be done by a proper and specific  Regimen  in Quantity and Quality by Air and Exercise and by welljudg'd and timeous Evacuation and prepareing  the morbid Juices for easier Elimination by Means which I fear lie in a narrow Compass and depend mostly on the mild mineral Medicins which were never originally design'd by Nature to be introduc'd into an animal Body and always rend tear and wear them out faster like  Spirits  and  chymical  Medicins but in bad Cases are at first at least necessary judiciously managed with proper  Dilution  §  PHLEBOTOMY  will directly let out a Part of the bad and vicious  Juices  to be immediatly supplied with good  ones  from proper Regimen by making the Vessels more  roomy  and thereby enabling the  Circulation  to make her fuller Rounds for when the BloodVessels are  too turgid  and full or the Juices too thick gross and sizy to tumify them the natural  Secretions  and Discharges will be too small to admit into them new fresh sweet  Juices  from Food or Physic which welltim'd partial and frequent  Phlebotomy  will much assist  Vomits  drive forcibly out of the upper Part of the  chyliferous Tube  not only its noxious Contents but strongly squeeze all the  Glands  which are infinit of the  Abdomen  dissolve and  fuse  by its  Convulsions  and internal Compressure their Contents and that of the universal Mass of the Fluids and promote their  Expulsion  and  frequently repeated  are of more Use and Efficacy than all the other Evacuations join'd together for they not only truly  reach the Habit supply the Place of Exercise cleanse the  internal Viscera  and  Glands  which can by no other means be reached but compress squecze and drive out the most distant Obstructions by setting the whole  System  and the most remote  Fibre  in violent Action and Play and where the Solids and natural Strength will admit are I think the most  universal Remedy  known to  Art  if obstinatly and long persisted in in  chronical  and  obstinat  Cases especially for most infallibly they bring out all the latent most remote  Morbosities  in the Habit dissolve and fuse them and mix them with the universal Mass of Fluids in the Trunks of the great Vessels to be more readily and easily thrown out of the Habit but  they are a hard Work  and few can bear them  Purges  clean and empty the lower Part of the  chyliferous Tubes  leave the  Glands  situated there more Freedom to part with their  Obstructions  by subsequent Repetitions but this  Evacuation  tho' much easier yet is a  great way about  and of slow and small Efficacy in great Diseases unless the  Malady  be situated in the lowermost Regions of the Body and even then  Vomits  do it sooner and more effectually and in weak Habits and  nervous  Distempers Purges ruffle extremely  Diaphoretics  I think do little in these our  Northern Climats  unless they be very gentle and are useful only in  acute Cases  where Nature tends towards a  Crise  in chronical Cases they heat and inflame and only  spend the thinnest and most  aqueous  Parts of the Fluids which are generally most innocent  Diuretics  scour and clean the  urinary  Passages and carry off  scorbutic  and  nephritic Salts  but to be innocent or efficacious they ought to consist of the thinnest softest and coolest of all Liquors that is the purest Water just soften'd and  acuated  by the Meal or Salt of some proper Vegetable  Blisters  are mostly  Topical  they melt  fuse  and draw forth the viscid Serum from the  capillary  Vessels and leave Room for a freer Circulation and when promoted and effected by  Cantharides  have a sensible Effect on the most distant Fluids and Solids and in acute Cases they are indeed the greatest and most effectual  Remedy  These are most and chiefest of the Evacuations used in the Practice of  Physic  and judiciously and properly pursued are of the greatest Consequence to lay a solid Foundation for a  Cure  §  MERCURY  and  Antimony  alone with their milder Preparations judiciously managed and united with the specific Juice of  Vegetables  that Experience has determin'd proper for the Distemper upon all the Reasoning and Experience I have ever had bids fairest for attenuating the Juices and opening the Obstructions in the small Vessels and  Glands  and so fitting the morbid Particles for Elimination but they are a twoedged Sword and destroy weak Persons in unskilful Hands but I have Occasion to speak more explicitly of  their Nature and Effects in another Place  Nitre  and its Preparations especially the  animal  Preparation of it in  Woodlice  has been thought by all  Antiquity  the most innocent and yet most effectual of all the  saline Tribe  of Medicins to cool deterge and open Obstructions and its sensible Effect in dividing the  BloodGlobules  in the  Lungs  and giving it thereby its  Scarlet  Colour and its Efficacy in propagating and quickening  Fire  and Light in both which Effects it has undoubtedly a great Power if not the greatest shew its  Energy  and in  febrile  Exacerbations especially of the  Symptomatic  kind from malignant Ulcers and an  inflammatory  State of the Blood when plentifully diluted with  pure  Water and long continued I think and have found it the best if not the only  Remedy  sufficient to justify the great Encomium on the  Natron  of the Antients When the Blood is sufficiently  fus'd  and the  Glands  made sufficiently open and pervious by  Evacuation  and  Diet  then  Steel    Bark  and  Bitters  judiciously prepared and fitted to the original Strength of the  Solids  of the Patients will be found the most effectual to wind up the  Springs  of  Life  and to give a  Tension  due  Tone  and proper Degree of  Elasticity  to the  Solids  the  Fibres  and Nerves but especially the  Membranes  which I think are the true and only  Seats  of  Spring  and  Elasticity  and the proper immediat Instruments of  Motion  and the  Functions  in an  animal Machin  Long and great Evacuation and a thin cool Diet while  they are pursued to  fuse  thin and attenuat the Juices must of Necessity  relax  and let down the  Spring  of all the  Solids  when the Juices are sufficiently thin'd and attenuated which  Bloodletting  will always discover then to give Strength Vigour and Activity to the Patient that all the  Secretions  may be duely made the sole  Intention  to perfect the Cure I say is to wind up the  Solids  again as far as  Art  can which I fear is not far at least I have never found it much nor very dureable for all  Astringents  are of the Nature act by the same Laws and have the Effect that  Wine  and  spirituous Liquors  have and are not unlike the buckling upon  Pipes  and boiling soft broken Hair they will give them a new  Tension  and proper Figure for a short time but their Efficacy and Relief is only  fugitive  and transient and never dureable and they effect at the same time a thickening incrassating and sizeing on the Blood and Juices while they are winding up braceing and contracting the  Solids  for the Effects of the Qualities and Powers of all Bodies both  Liquids  and  Solids  of Food and  Physic  are always in a  duplicat  Proportion of the Distance from the  Centre  of their component  Particles  There is indeed this Difference between  Bark    Bitters  and  Steel  and that of  strong Liquors  that the Sides of the Vessels especially their fine close  membranous  Coats imbibe attract and preserve the  astringent  Virtue and Qualities of  Bark    Bitters  and  Steel  and such Astringents and Bracers longer  by reason of their innate  attractive  Virtue on the Particles of such Bodies their greater  Solidity  and closer  Texture  than the  Blood Globules  and the circulating Fluids do which are in a perpetual  Flux  and  spirituous  Liquors mixing more immediatly fully and by closer and larger  Contacts  with the circulating Juices spend their Efficacy on them and thicken them faster For these Causes and Reasons I say  strong  Liquors must have a more immediat and stronger Effect on the Blood and Juices for condensing and thickening them than  Steel    Bitters  and  Bark  and suchlike Astringents can have and so spirituous Liquors much indulged must necessarily have a much quicker and more  deleterious  Effect on animal Fluids than  Steel  and  Astringents  can but still they both act in one  Tenor  and by one  general Law  and  Steel    Bitters  and Astringents improperly and intemperatly us'd and overdos'd will have the same kind of bad Effects and produce the same  Symptoms  and Diseases that Intemperance in strong Liquors will only they are sooner felt are less grateful and bewitching are much less or not at all craved and consequently are sooner given over  § IT is  Diet  alone proper and specific  Diet  in  Quantity    Quality  and  Order  continued in till the Juices are sufficiently thinn'd to make the Functions regular and easy which is the sole  universal Remedy  and the only Mean known to Art or that an animal Machin  without being otherwise made than it is can use with certain Benefit and Success which can give  Health    long Life  and Serenity There is an  innate  Degree of Strength and  Elasticity  in the  Solids  to circulat the Liquors and promote the  Secretions  and carry on the  vital Functions  with which one comes into the World which they derive from their  Birth  and  Parents  which is ever after but little alter'd even either by  Art  or  Diet Growth  Inlargement of the Body and crusting over the original Solids and  Maturation  only fills the linear and infinitesimal original  Tubes  and Vessels with a proper Liquor to stretch extend and plump them as a Sack is fill'd with Grain or a Bladder with Air or Water from that Liquor their  Coats  the fleshy and nervous  Fibres  of the Muscles  Tendons  and  Membrans  and other Solids of the Body is thicken'd crusted over and condens'd the  Spring    Elasticity  and motive Power lies solely and intirely in the original primary divinely organis'd linear  Fibrils  and the  Membrans  made of them The Incrustration and Incrassation from the Fluids in the  Tubes  superinduced on them but weakens their original  Spring  and  Elasticity  both by its Weight and  incommensurat Vibrations  as we find by the  Elasticity  of Twigs the  sharp Notes  of fine small Hairs and the  Agility  of young Animals The  Elasticity  consists mainly in the original Degree of  Attraction  in the component  elementary  Particles of the  linear Fibrils  primarily fashion'd by the  Author  of  Nature  and it is in this  Elasticity  alone the Force Power and Pleasure of Life and of the  animal Functions  consists If the  Elasticity  of these Solids be such as easily readily and pleasantly to overcome and slide over all the  Rubs  Impediments and  Letts  in the  Functions  whatever State the Fluids be in then the Animal is healthy active and gay otherwise if they are perform'd with Labour and Struggle and from too great Efforts of the  selfmotive  Principle on the primarily  divinely organis'd Vehicles  and its Load of Crust which is laid on it to defend it from the Injuries of this  Element  and ruinous  Planet  we are now confin'd to For as a  Surgeon  lays a Plaister on a Sore to defend it from the  Air  and the  Touch  of hard rough Bodies if this  Plaister  itself should be hard rough  corrosive  or stimulating it would become a Pain and Incommodity instead of a Pleasure or Defence It is out of the Juices that circulat in the  Tubes  that this  plaistering  is made on the  primitive  sensible  elastic Fibrils  and it is therefore of the last Consequence and indeed the  One  thing necessary that these Juices be the sweetest lightest and most  lenient  possible and this we can only bring about by Diet  soft    sweet    cool    mild Diet  § SOME Persons have industriously and designedly spread it about that I was of Opinion that a  sole  strict Vegetable or  Milk  and  Seed Diet  was the best and fittest for all  Persons    Climats  and Ages without Exception or Limitation and the  only one  proper approv'd by the  Author  of  Nature  and  specific  to cure all animal Distempers advised my Patients no other or pretended to cure them no other way be their Distemper what it will My Opinions are of little Consequence to the World and I hope I have too little Value or Regard for them as they are  mine  to be any Degree  sanguin  or concern'd for their Reception I have and I hope have always express'd so great a Regard for the  Wisdom    Fitness  and Propriety of Things as discover'd by  Revelation  from whence the Patent for  animal  Food is deriv'd not to set up my Opinions or Ideas in Opposition to those of  holy Writ  and the Divine  Spirit  speaking in it The Wisdom of  Man  even that of the highest  Cherubim  is but  Foolishness  when compared with the  Omniscience  of  God  and his wise Providence He that  made  us and sent us here knows best what is fittest for us to answer and bring about his own Designs of  Love  and  Mercy  But I am thoroughly convinced from  Reason    Experience    Philosophy  and  Revelation  that in our  present State  in this our  probatory  transitory Situation on this ruinous  Globe  sensibly and  evidently spoil'd a second time by the  Deluge  on which we are now situated that  animal Food  their Juices and  integral Particles  are the fittest and most proper to produce most quickly and more immediatly the firmest hardest human Flesh and warmest strongest Blood There is a  Similarity  and  Homogeneity  between the  muscular Flesh  of tender sweet  Animals  and that of the  human  Body the  integral Particles  of the  Solids  of the  first  and the component  Globules  of their Juices are ready  form'd    figur'd  and adjusted to build up the  Flesh  and cloath the Solids and furnish out the Juices of the  latter  they are at hand adjusted by  Square  and  Compass  directly to be laid together to  rear  the  Solids  and their Juices are inur'd and familiaris'd to perform the  Meanders  of the Circulation and with Facility to perform all the  animal Functions  with the least Labour or Struggle less than those of  Vegetables  in general as a  Mason  will sooner and more strongly build the Walls of a House who has hewn plain  rectangular  Stones at hand than one who has rough Stones only Sand and Mortar all which must be first figur'd or prepar'd for a solid dureable  Building  All this I think is true just and  philosophical  and while Youth and tolerable Health continues none ought to  alter  the common temperat Diet of the middling Rank of those among whom he lives for a particular or  artificial  one without  a particular  Call  and the best Advice Nay I think such a Change unnatural out of the Order of  Providence  and in some Degree  immoral  When a Person is tolerably well and not far advanced into Life to change an  animal  for a  vegetable  Diet to avoid mere Possibilities and future  Contingencies  is arrogantly prying into the divine Decrees and insolently  criticising  the Conduct of his Providence If God's Design is to purify us by Pains and Penalties here ours ought not to be only the mere enjoying the  Kingdoms of this World  and the  Glories  thereof If his be to shorten the Time of our Sufferings by rendering them more  intense  ours ought to be to bear them as long as by his Assistance we possibly can in the common Course of Nature and Providence for if we  cowardly  fly from them on one Side He has Power and Skill enough to double them in another in this Particular  whatever is    is best  But if we should find our Pains and Sufferings so intense that they are no longer tolerable but hinder instead of promoting what is our  Duty  and  Vocation  and what we are convinced is best for us then he has advised us  when persecuted in one City    to flee to another  Then and only then when  animal Food  will no longer do we are to try what  Milk  and  Seeds  can do to ease our Pain It is only the  Cross  of  God's Appointment  and which he declares his by natural Causes and in the Course of his Providence  unforeseen  and  unavoidable  which we are to  take up daily  and with all the Joy Alacrity and Resignation that the Meaning of a  Cross  can imply that is  the best we can  with the Aid of his  Grace  And if Suffering Punishment Pains and Penalties and shortening the Duration of our Imprisonment here be the very best for us in our present Situation and State and if  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors naturally necessarily and  mechanically  produce these Effects more readily than  Vegetables  Milk and Seed Foods and aqueous Liquors then was it with infinit Wisdom Kindness and Fitness that the Holy Spirit permitted  animal  Food and inlarged the  Materials  of our  Aliment  even tho' his first Intention for Man had been Vegetables only which could only be in a paradisaical State or on a better unspoil'd  Planet  But the real Truth is  Nature  our  Globe  the various unkindly  Climats  the different Ages States Conditions and Circumstances under which Man is at present render it utterly  impossible  and  impracticable  that Man should be advis'd order'd or commanded by infinit Wisdom to live only on  Vegetables  It is not and it cannot be by  Bread alone  that Man can live at present it cannot answer the Ends Uses and Occasions Men are now necessitated to pursue Great and sudden Efforts of  Prowess  and Strength cannot be answer'd or executed by  Vegetables  and Water only they are too thin weak and poor  Youthhood  Vigour  Robustness and great Action would be tortur'd and languish under Bread and Water in ever so great Plenty  Milk    Fruits    Seeds  and  Vegetables  in any Perfection are of much greater Expence and Labour to procure than that the Poor and Necessitous now can afford them especially in  Northern Climats  they have lost their Vigour Energy and Balsam since the Deluge Milk is appropriated for Children and not grown Men to answer the Ends of Providence But to explain my Thoughts on this Matter as a  Physician  only as clearly and precisely as I can as they flow from natural Philosophy the animal Oeconomy and my own  Experience  I say That after a  Fever  or any  acute  Distemper is over and had its perfect  Crise  and the Person is not past the  Meridian  of Life the Blood and Juices by the strong and violent Labour of the Solids being sufficiently  ground    effete  and  languid  a  Milk    Seed  or  vegetable Diet  is by no means long and obstinatly to be continued in it would continue the Party  too languid  the  Juices too thin and vapid  and the  Spirits  too low and therefore he ought absolutely to be directed to an  animal  Diet and  temperatly  strong Liquors of the lightest most nourishing and  balsamic  Nature to be gradually and cautiously enter'd upon especially as he begins to be capable of  Air  and  Exercise  If upon takeing away a few Ounces of Blood only out of a large  Orifice  the  Curd  is found too thin tender watery and  too readily  fusible  or dissolvible in warm Water and the  Serum  too clear whiteish or in too great a Quantity a  Milk    Seed  and  vegetable Diet  is by no means to be longer continued in but is to be altered gradually into light sweet and young  animal  Food and temperat fermented Liquors If after two three four or five Years the Disorders for which a low cool Diet was advis'd and enter'd upon with sufficient Strictness and Precision is not cured or greatly reliev'd the Party may conclude that a low cool Diet will not make a perfect Cure and must with Patience and a general Regularity enter on common Life and not be longer scrupulous or anxious about  Regimen  in the Quality but in the Quantity and submit to the Order of Providence and use the Means that Experience or the best Advice suggests to alleviat the  Symptoms  and do the best he can  taliter qualiter  if he is under Fifty To such as have an original hereditary weakly  scorbutical  or  scrophulous  Habit and are far advanced in Life who have  mesenteric glandular  Obstructions with feeble Solids and little Strength and Vigour a  Milk    Seed  and  vegetable Diet  with  aqueous  Liquors is by no means to be advis'd for as the Case is absolutely incureable it were in vain to torment and restrain them more cruelly than their Distemper itself does they must not be forbid but rather indulged the common  Comforts  and  Gratifications  of Life It is to such that St  Paul  's Advice to  Timothy  is just as well as kind  to drink a little Wine for their Stomachs sake    and their often Infirmities  A general Moderation and an Observation of the  Juvantia  and  Laedentia  is only to be advised and the Use of these Means known to Art to alleviat  Symptoms  In all  eruptive  Cases in all acute and  periodical  cutaneous Cases in the actual Fits of the  Gout  in the  second Fever  of the SmallPox in  Fevers  verging towards a  Crise  to drive out from the Centre to the Circumference any changeable Disorder and universally in all Cases where the  vital Indications  languish and labour and Nature is in a Struggle to throw outward  Morbosity  she is most certainly to be assisted by generous  cordial  and warmer Medicins and higher  Diet  to further the End Nature points at These are some of the Cases where too low and cool a  Regimen  is by no means to be advised or pursued And  lastly  Whenever the End of a low Diet is obtained  viz  the  sweetning  and  thinning  the Juices and the  Symptoms  are abated or cured the Diet is to be heighten'd and gradually and cautiously rais'd at least if the Party be under Fifty I will now suggest as plainly in what Cases I think it is to be advised and tried As to the Healthy and Well I have nothing here to say  Sufficient for the Day is the Evil thereof  § IT is only to those whose  Stomach  and Digestion is so weak and relax'd that they  cannot concoct without extreme Suffering any such Proportion even of tender  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors as may be sufficient to nourish and support them To  those  whose Blood and Juices are evidently so  thick    gross  and  viscid  that it fills and obstructs the Vessels so  tumidly  that they cannot receive a sufficient Quantity of either  Medicin  or  Food  to cure or preserve them the Circulation and Perspiration being intirely at a stand To  those  who are subject to perpetual  Haemorrhages  Inflammations or constant small acute  Fevers  To  those  who are after the great Meal towards Midnight  hectical  or  consumptive  To  those  labouring under a  scorbuticonervose Atrophy  and wasting To  those  labouring under hereditary early knotted disabling and painful  Gouts  or  Stone  To  those  who are highly hereditarily and early  scrophulous  or  scorbutical  To  those  who are  leprous  and universally crusted over with  cutaneous Blotches  and  Scabs  To  those  who are  epileptical  early in Life with a thin  cacochymic  Habit To  those  who are constantly  hysterical  or  hypocondriacal  with frequent  Fits  and  Convulsions  under a weak thin Habit which threaten a  Consumption  for I have always observed these obstinat violent  hysteric  and  hypocondriac  Fits in young slender Persons to be the first  Stage  of a real  Phthisis Pulmonum  or at least of a  nervous Atrophy  and if it was not cured or prevented in this its first  Stage by the same Means and Regimen commonly the Refuge of the subsequent Stages they were not to be ever after remedied they being sure Presages of  Tubercles  in the Lungs To  those  that are plainly  cancerous  in short to  those  chiefly who after they have long and strictly follow'd the best Advice and the most effectual Remedies still labour under some atrocious painful and dangerous Distemper to such and such only have I ever advised a total rigid  Milk  and  vegetable Diet  with  aqueous Liquors  but no longer to be continued than till the  Symptoms  were extremely mitigated or intirely overcome and then if it was after the  Meridian  of Life to be persisted in obstinatly if long before it to be gradually and cautiously alter'd into common Life with great Temperance and I know all honest and experienced  Physicians    antient  and  modern  are and must be of the same Mind  § THE great and essential Difference between  animal  and  vegetable  Food is much the same as between  Chemical  and  Galenical  Medicins  Chemical  Medicins are the suppos'd at least their most active Virtues and Qualities of  Plants    Metals  and  Minerals  contracted and concentred into a small Volume by the Tortures of the Fire their useless or destructive Parts separated and thrown away and their useful and  sanative  Qualities compacted and united into an immediat  Contact  and condensed They would be of admirable Use and Convenience if these suppos'd  Facts  and such mentioned Virtues were just solid and true or if an  animal  Body could bear them without greater or more fatal future Injuries than their present Benefit how great soever or Convenience can compensat But it is most certain that such  Medicins    Drugs  or Bodies are the most destructive to animal Bodies if long and in great Quantities thrown in that Malice can invent beyond Gunpowder itself and even spirituous Liquors for not only Nature has provided none such but as  Poisons  in venomous Creatures to kill their Enemies or cook them for their Food but that the Particles of Fire the most destructive of any are so closely impacted and  transubstantiated  in as never to be afterwards separated from them and that their component  Particles  are so minutely divided by the  Tortures  of the Fire as to acquire such a Force of  Attraction  towards the Particles of animal Bodies such a  Polarity  as Dr  Lister  observed in all Calcinations both of  Vegetables  and  Minerals  so constantly to answer the  Magnet  that they become Iron  Bristles  Nails and Lancets darting directly and perpendicularly into the Solids so as quickly to tear rend and destroy or fix them and so can never be proper for  Food  or  Physic  whereas  Galenical  Medicins consisting of the  integral Particles  of  Vegetables    Metals  or  Minerals    dissolved only by gentle Heat and Moisture in a watry  Menstruum  have none of these  deleterious  Qualities on  animal  Bodies but become their Food as well as Physic and naturally take the Places of the morbid Particles of animal Habits which Time and the natural  Functions mechanically  throw off Just so  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors are the smallest most  elementary  and  attractive  Particles united and concenter'd like the Rays of the Sun in the  Focus  of a Burningglass Their delicious Flavour and Savour consists in their greater abundance of  Oil  and  Salts  which are the most active and consequently the most destructive to animal Bodies If they are sufficiently diluted and their  Volume  and Quantity increas'd by the more innocent and unactive Particles of fine Earth and Water they may be safely used approaching thereby very near to  Vegetables  Juices and fermented Liquors much diluted with Water become the nearest Approximation to  pure Water  the only  Beverage  designed and fitted by Nature for  long Life    Health  and  Serenity  and the whole Study of the Patient and Intention of the  Physician  ought to be to find out this just  Mediocrity  of  animal  and vegetable Food when combin'd for  Aliment  and of  fermented  and aqueous Liquors mix'd for  Beverage  which is the most proper for preserving his Health or curcing his Disorders for there is very little in the  Specification  of the  Diet  whether it  be all  Vegetable  or partly  Animal  partly  Vegetable  some Vegetables being more  deleterious  to  animal  Constitutions than some  animal  Substances and there is but a very little Difference between pure  warm  Water and cold Water  warm'd  with a very little Wine the just Mixture and  Proportion  suited to the Constitution and Distempers of the Patient is by far the greatest Affair tho' in the Distempers by me just now  specified  that are painful and dangerous too great Exactness both in Quantity and Quality is never to be  slighted  for in a true  statical  Balance such as the Constitutions under the mentioned Diseases are a few Grains or Spoonfuls thrown in will destroy the  Equilibrium  of Health and Ease  § THE Benefits a Person who desires nothing but a  clear Head  and  strong intellectual Faculties  would reap by religiously drinking nothing but  Water  tepid or cold as the Season is while he is yet young and tolerably healthy well educated and of a sober honest Disposition are innumerable As That he would live probably till towards an  hundred  Years of Age that being the Term of Life appointed by the Design of the Creator even after the  Deluge  and after that eating of  animal  Food was permitted before as it is believ'd  fermented  Liquors were invented at least if we have any regard for  Moses  's History which yet cannot be denied to be one  of the justest Accounts of these early Times That he would thereby constantly enjoy a  clear  Head  calm  at least  governable  Passions a Facility in  intellectual  Applications and in the Acquisition of Virtue and so having a longer Duration secur'd to him and all Impediments removed he might make surprizing and wonderful Advances in  both  He would thereby be secur'd against all the great  atrocious  and  frightful  Distempers such as  Melancholy    Lowness  of  Spirits    Wrongheadedness    Lunacy  and  Madness  the Bane of the finest best and most penetrating Spirits in  Great Britain  For I defy any Man to give an Instance of any furious  Madness  or great and obstinat  Lunacy  or  Melancholy  in any one who soon after Twenty enter'd on Water drinking only let him eat what he can for it is  fermented  Liquors only that inflame the  Membrans  and  membranous Tubuli  the  Nerves  which are the bodily Organs of  intellectual  Operations It is the  Fire    Sulphur  and  volatile Tartar  of  fermented  Liquors that inflame corrugat and stimulat these  Membranes  and their linear Threads into violent Succussions that break and tear them which are the immediat Cause of these frightful and overwhelming Distempers as they are of the painful tortureing ones  Gout    Stone    Cancer  and  Consumption  For tho' Gluttony will thicken the  Curd  of the Blood and thereby cause Obstructions in the  Glands  and  Capillaries  from whence many  and various Distempers may arise yet will they be of the obtuse slow lingering Kind and in which Nature will always give a timeous and early Warning by  Inappetency    Nausea    Vomiting    Purging    Sweating    Spitting  or  Rheums  which will opportunely stop the Progress and while Water is plentifully then craved and given it will carry on distance in the Circulation and dilute this too viscid  Curd  to prevent an intire Obstruction of the  animal  Functions or destroy Life and hinder the Generation of  Gout    Stone    Cancer  and  Consumption  which are solely produc'd by the hard salin Concretions of  fermented  Liquors But The most signal Benefit a Man will reap from early Waterdrinking solely while as yet in tolerable Health is being preserv'd from the  acute    sudden  and  mortal  Distempers as  Apoplexies    Suffocations    Fevers  of all kinds  Pestilences  and  Pleurisies  It is to  fermented    strong  or  spirituous  Liquors solely that these quick and destructive Distempers owe their true Cause which give no Warning and admit of no Cure At least Waterdrinking solely is the only Preservative I am certain known or knowable to Art Accidents  epidemical  Causes a constant Neglect or a total Inability to guard against the Dangers of the other  Nonnaturals  absolutly necessary towards perfect Health and Life may produce some Degrees of these mention'd grand Distempers but then under sole Waterdrinking  they will neither be so painful nor dangerous For it is certain Waterdrinking Dilution and  thin  Diet is the only Mean known to Art and Experience to cure them when Persons are already seiz'd with these Distempers join'd with strong and proper Evacuations and whatever will cure will prevent as Water pour'd on will extinguish Fire so it will prevent its being kindled or beginning If these frightful painful and mortal Distempers happen sometimes in  Eastern  or  Southern  Climats where  fermented  Liquors are not much in Use it is because they wallow and indulge in some things almost equally as pernicious and inflammatory as these  strong  Liquors as high in  Aromaticks    eastern Gums  and  Juices    Opiats  the  volatile cepacious Roots    Fruits  and  Seeds  of the  poisonous    soporiferous  or  stimulating  kind with which those Climats abound which is the sole Cause of all their  inflammatory  Distempers and unnatural and dissolveing Lust for these are all but  dry Drams  of a more dureable and adhesive Nature than some of the  liquid  ones for Fire is still Fire whether  Solar  or  Culinary    Natural  or  Chemical  whether it is  transubstantiated  into  liquid  or  solider  Matter and Water is its only Extinguisher  § I HAVE said that the  Quantity  of  Aliment  Meats and Drinks is of much greater Consequence in general than the  Quality  for the Preservation of Life Health and Serenity If a Man study the  least  light or heavy will not so much incommode him The great End and Use of a  low Diet  or one of  Milk    Seeds  and  Vegetables  is to mend the  Juices  to cool attenuat and sweeten the circulating  Fluids  whatever  Diet  does this must  mechanically  relax unbend and let down the  Spring  of the Solids It is true the Superiority of the  Force  or  Spring  of the Solids must be always greater than the  Resistance  of the Fluids else the Animal could not live at all that is the  animal Functions  could not be perform'd and this  Superiority  must be continued in some Proportion whatever  Regimen  the Animal uses so long as it lives But it is certain a cool thin sweetning Diet attenuats the  Fluids  in a greater  Proportion  than it relaxes and unbends the  Solids  because All the  Secretions  are from the  Fluids  and not from the  Solids  and they spending and wasting  faster  must be sooner supply'd and alter'd by the proper Food Because the immediat Action of  Food  and  Physic  is upon the  Fluids  and they absorb and consume most of their Virtue and Efficacy and the  Solids  are never acted upon by them till the  Fluids  are fully saturated and  transubstantiated  into their Substance And Because all Fluids by their Nature are sooner and more readily acted upon and alter'd into foreign Qualities than any Solids possibly can and  hence it comes to pass that a Person on the immediat Change and for some considerable Time after in passing from a  high  to a  low Diet  will find his Health wonderfully mended for the better because the Resistance of the  Fluids  is immediatly lessen'd which will again even under the same  Diet  in Quantity and Quality wonderfully and as it were unaccountably totter and alter for the worse which happens on the  Despumation  of the  Glands    Capillaries  and  Solids  while they are  spewing  out and  disgorgeing  their  morbid  Contents on the  Primae Viae  but which by proper and  specific  Evacuations Exercise and  Astringents  afterwards will generally be set to rights again if the Person be at a  proper  Time of Life that is under Fifty for after that there is little Encouragement from any Mean but gentle  Evacuation  and a Perseverance in the  regulated Regimen  Nay even he must proceed lessening it in  Quantity  at least if not in  Quality  by proper Degrees and at proper Periods descending out of  Life  as one ascends into it  viz  by  MilkPorridge    WaterGruel    Panada  and the like But the great Benefit and Advantage a Man reaps from a  low    cool    thinning    sweetning Regimen  of Milk Seeds and Vegetables above what he can have under any Diet of  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors is that he can keep the  stretched  and extended Bowels and BloodVessels always fuller and plumper and in their  natural  Tension  and Situations and consequently will make the  Secretions  more plentifully and all the  Functions  will be more natural and easier than under a spare  cautious  and anxiously  guarded  starving  Regimen  of so little  animal  Food as is absolutly necessary as a weak Person will walk more easily in Stays than loose some lame Persons in a  Boot  than a Stocking and a  defensive Plaister  will keep a  Sore  easier than when it is bare and Excesses are neither so painful nor dangerous under the  first  as under the  second  Regimen and the same Person may safely venture on at least  four times  as much  Vegetable  Seed and Milk Food as he dare of  animal  Food of any kind at least of  dense    hard  or fullgrown  animal  Food  § I THINK the natural Order and  Progression  in  Regimen  for those who are ordain'd to or for those whose  Vocation  and  Occupation  is  sedentary  and  studious  who by the  Order  of  Providence  and Situation of Life have been  signatur'd  to intellectual Professions and for all those who would cultivat and maintain  clear Heads  and quick  Senses  to the last is from their Birth till Fifteen to persevere in a gradually increasing temperat  Diet  without fermented Liquors from Fifteen to Fifty to be only temperat in  animal  Foods and  fermented  Liquors after Fifty to give up  animal Food Suppers  and  fermented  Liquors after Sixty to give up  all animal Food  and  then every ten Years after to lessen about a quarter of the Quantity of their  vegetable  Food and thus gradually descend out of Life as they ascended into it And that all Persons subject to  inflammatory Distempers    Gouts    Erisipelas's    hot Scurvies    Leprosies    Asthma's    Jaundices    Colicks    nervous Lownesses    violent Headaches    Haemorrhages  and  Haemorrhoids    Anasarca's    Ruptures  or  white Swellings  tho' otherwise strong hearty hale and of a seeming sound Constitution ought to give up Meat Suppers and all fermented Liquors and that the Children of all Fathers for Mothers are not here to be minded who have died before Thirtyfive of any  natural Distemper  whatever and all the Children begot of  Fathers  after Sixty ought to live without  Meat Suppers  or  fermented  Liquors and that all Persons whatever whatever Age they be of or of whatever Nature their Complaints and Disorder may be if upon repeated small  Phlebotomies  and without transient Accidents as  Colds    Damps    Blasts  and  Bruises  they constantly observe their Blood sizy  viscous  and  glutinous  ought directly to be put on a low Diet either of Milk Seeds and Vegetables only or at least of one without Meat Suppers and fermented Liquors and this  Regimen  with proper attenuant alterative and sweetning Medicines which in the Nature of things ought to be of the mild  ponderous  and  mineral  Tribe to be continued  till at least this Size and Glew be broken and dissolved else they can never expect uniform and continued Health for such a Regimen and such Medicins must do this in Time else nothing in Nature possibly can  §  UNPHILOSOPHICAL  and unexperienced Persons tho' they know and observe the great  critical  Alteration that happens in the  Sex  in or about Fifty and that without a special Care both in the  Regimen  proper  Evacuation  and  alterative  Medicins they are in great Danger either of their Lives or of some  chronical  and obstinat Distempers that make their Lives ever after miserable and uncomfortable after that Period yet think this  Misfortune  peculiar to  Females  and that the  Males  have a Privilege and Security to be luxurious and sensual to the last which is the  true Reason  why so few die  natural Deaths  and that most pass as really and truly out of Life in a violent untimely Manner as a  Felon  who suffers under  public Justice  The  Matter  of  Fact  and Order of Nature is this Fifty was design'd as the  Meridian  of Life in this our  lapsed  State and Duration on this ruinous  Planet  from this  solstitial  Point it is a Descent out of Life From the  Birth  upwards to this Point the Solids were developeing expanding crusting over and hardening to their utmost Extension Firmness and Density and thereby their  Elasticity  beginning  then at Fifty to weaken and unbend and they to  ossify  the  Digestions  become grosser and more imperfect the  Secretions  lessen and all the  animal Functions  labour and then if due Care is not taken to obviat these Effects the  chronical  Distempers naturally arising out of these Causes and that lurked in the  original Constitution  begin to emerge and sprout out the  Viscera  to  tumify  and  obstruct  the  Glands  then swell and press on the circulating BloodVessels the  Capillaries  to coalesce become full and dense and the  Nerves  and  Membranes  are interrupted in their  Play  and Vibrations and all the  animal Machin  labours and the Functions are perform'd heavily with Pain and Struggle This is the true Time and  Season  of Life for Attention Consideration and Care of a wise Man and a  Philosopher  The  Hyperbolic Curve  of Life is at the Point of its Return  downwards  again and if then proper Care be taken by some few Evacuations Alteratives and a Regimen to put a  Drag  on the Wheels of Life that they may go down gently calmly and serenely these become more useful to themselves and others than in the first ascending part of Life and this happens equally to both the  Sexes  for it is not from this Season being the common  Period  of the  Fertility  of the  Female Sex  that these Appearances happen but is a  general Law  of  Nature  to both  Sexes  from the Causes assign'd for all the Difference of the  Sexes  lies in the different  Configuration  of the superinduc'd Crust or Shell laid over the primitive  aethereal  Body which in both is probably pretty near of the same Figure Size and Materials originally  § IT is not an unpleasant  Speculation  to  contemplat  the Order of Nature in its  Progression  towards reducing this our Tabernacle of Clay into its original Dust from its Cradle to its Coffin especially in those who live the whole Duration of the natural Life The Diseases of  Infancy  are generally  Scabs    Blotches  and  Blains  over the Face Head Eyes and Ears sometimes  Fits  and Convulsions and such  Cephalic  and Head Distempers and these are certainly  constitutional  and  parental  Disorders communicated by the morbid Juices of the  Parents  the Colicks  Vomitings  and  Diarrhoea's  succeeding come from the improper Nourishment in  Quantity  or  Quality  of the  Mothers  or  Nurses  the  Measles  and  Smallpox  are also original and parental Impurities convey'd to the Blood and Juices in the Birth from too high and too much animal Food and are most of them the Diseases of the upper Region of the Body When Nature has struggled by these to purify the Juices by such  Despumations  then come the Distempers of the  Breast  and  Lungs  in  Coughs    Catarrhs    Consumptions    Asthma's    Pleurisies  or  Peripneumonies  after these come Pains in the  Stomach    Heartburnings    Colicks    bilious Vomitings    Jaundice  and  Diarrhoea's  then succeed  Gouts    Stone  and  Gravel    Palsies    Rheumatisms  and fixing of the Joints and very often  Ruptures    Piles  or  Mortifications  in the  Bowels    Feet  or  Toes  the Diseases of the  lower  Regions All I would insinuat by this  Reflection  is that  Nature  seems to aim and would certainly if not interrupted by Accidents obtain and pursue a kind of a  regular  and uniform  Progression  in her Course of  dissolving  and  mouldering  into Dust this  Adamical  Crust of  Clay  by Distempers  topical  and  local  from the  Head  through the  Viscera  to the  Feet  and Joints till like a  dying Vegetable  she has fix'd it in the Earth from whence it sprung This is certainly her  general Law  if not interrupted by  original    parental  Diseases or Accidents hurting some of the  Organs  before it was born or by  Accidents  proper and peculiar to the Party itself or a general  bad Regimen  which may quicken this  Progress  or throw it out of its natural  Progression  on a weaken'd Part that may discompose the  general Law  of  Nature  § FOR Perspicuity and Brevity I distinguish  four Orders  and Degrees of  Regimen of Diet  that is of Meat and Drink  viz  The  common Diet  of a reasonable Proportion of  animal Food  and  fermented Liquors  common to the  middling Rank  of the Healthy  Temperat and Sober in every  Climat  or Country A Diet of plain fresh  animal  Food once a Day without any  fermented  Liquor only plain Water or Toast and tepid Water for Beverage or one of one Day Meat without  Wine  and another Day a little  Wine  without  Meat  which I would call the  trimming Diet  A Diet without any  animal Food  but one of  Milk    Seeds    Fruits  and  Vegetables  any thing where the Life of no Animal is wanted to compose or dress such as Eggs Gravey and the like A  total strict Milk  and  Seed Diet  only without any other Materials Of these I intend to say something in  general  and in this Order both as to their Times and Cookery But first as to the  Order  or Time of changeing any one of these different kinds of  Regimen  one for another  § WHEN a Person is tolerably well and is subject to no painful or dangerous Distemper I think it his Duty and the Order of  God  and  Providence  to  let Well alone  and with general Temperance without Solicitude Anxiety or Scrupulosity to persevere in the  common Regimen  of the middling healthy temperat Order of Men in the Country and  Climat  where he was born or long habituated To follow St  Paul  's Advice in another Case to ask no Questions about what he should  eat  for Health's sake or rather our  Saviour  's Counsel not to be  solicitous  or take  anxious  Care  about what he should eat    or what he should drink    or wherewithal he should be cloathed  but without Curiosity or Nicety take a Share of whatever is presented For to live at such a Time and in such a Circumstance  medically  is truly to live miserably and  propter vitam vivendi perdere causas  It is enough for a  wise Man  and a  Christian Philosopher  to stop and attend to  Diet  and  Regimen  when by the  Order  of  Providence  his natural and providential Course of common  Regimen  is  barr'd  up by some Disorder or Distemper and then wise Nature will give him timeous Warning by  Inappetency  a  Nausea  Reaching  Vomiting  a Flatulence Fulness or Pain in the Stomach for all Distempers begin first at the Stomach or Bowels and then ascend to the  Head  which is the Language of the  God  of  Nature  saying to the Person  Man    take Care  and then and only then ought a  Christian Philosopher  mind his  Regimen  and by  Evacuation  moderat  Fasting  or  Exercise  endeavour to relieve or remove the Grief or apply to some honest experienced  Physician  for Advice  § IF the Case is  acute  the Party is not generally at least for any Time in a Condition to observe or direct for himself But seldom any notable Errors are committed in  Regimen  then for on the slightest Attempts to any great Excess either in  Quantity  or  Quality  Nature immediatly  revolts  and the Party suffers to such an Extremity by the  Exacerbations  of his  Symptoms  that any notable Progress in such an unnatural  Regimen  cannot possibly be receiv'd or persisted in and yet I have seen and felt by the Indiscretion of  Friends  or the officious Sedulity of  Nurses  the poor Patient suffer to mortal  Agonies  and sometimes to Death in  acute  Cases by improper Loads of  high Foods  or liquid or solid  Drams  and  Cordials  and many have suffer'd more from high and hot Drugs than ever they could from the Distemper In  acute Cases  seldom any thing that is given either for  Food  or  Physic  passes the  Primae Viae  unless it be extremely  light  and  liquid  In such the wiser  Antients  scarce ever administred besides proper Evacuation any thing but tepid  Water  simple  Oxymel  or Water soften'd or sharpned by the  Flour  or Meal of some proper or  specific Vegetable  Long obstinat Fasting continued even  ad Deliquium  with plentiful  Dilution  and the Evacuation indicated by the Nature of the Distemper was their most  universal Remedy  But it is not of Regimen in  acute Cases  that I here intend to speak my sole Business is with  chronical  Cases  § BUT since  chronical  Cases are only  acute  Cases diluted and drawn out into a longer Time with weaker  Paroxysins  and a more protracted  Crise  since Nature has a  general Law  and  Type  by which she governs and  signatures  such  acute  Distempers especially in those who follow  her Laws  and Simplicity and not disturbed by  spurious Art  or Accidents since  Fasting  proper  Evacuation  and  Dilution  are the great Remedies indicated in  acute  Cases it is natural and highly probable to suppose that proper  Evacuation  Abstinence and thin cool soft  Regimen  longer persisted in will be the single Intention pointed out and the great and  cardinal  Remedies in chronical Cases and therefore when a Person under common Life is seized with a  chronical  Distemper which by prudent Abstinence and lessening the Quantity of this  common Diet  is not remov'd he ought to apply to the proper  Directors  of Health and follow their Advice religiously in the Use of Medicins and  Regimen  they order and if in  three Months  time in  chronical  Cases by rigorously pursuing the order'd Medicins and Regimen their Symptoms are not totally remov'd or greatly reliev'd and mitigated he may I think fairly conclude the  Regimen  was not low cool and thin enough for the End propos'd and therefore ought to resolve to sink his  Regimen  both in Quantity and Quality and enter upon what I call the  trimming Diet  § BUT before any Person resolves to sink or alter his  Regimen  of Diet or any prudent  Physician  ought to advise such an Alteration  he ought always to premise a gentle partial  Phlebotomy  out at the  largest  Vein and from the largest Orifice commonly open'd for a small  Trunk  of a Vein will only send out such Blood as is much different from the  Crase  of the whole Mass the Circulation being slower in the small  Branches  the  Viscidity  is generally impacted into the smallest in a greater Proportion and the  serous  Part by the Slowness is perspired or run off by the  Lymphatics  and lateral Branches and a small  Orifice  either compresses and breaks the Texture of the  Curd  of the Blood disunites and separates the  Globules  so that the Observation cannot be fairly or with any Degree of  Accuracy  made but by comparing the Blood so let out with other sound healthy Blood for Example that of a healthy Person or of a Bullock or Sheep if the Difference in  Taste    Colour    Cohesion  of the Globules and  Curd  and the Proportion thereof to the  Serum  be in all or most of these Distinctions greatly different from those of the  sound Blood  it may fairly be concluded that the  Regimen  of Diet both in  Quantity  and  Quality  is to be sunk and lessen'd and that proper and  specific  alterative Medicins to thin and sweeten the Blood are indicated especially those of the mild ponderous Nature at first with the  Galenical  Vegetables which universal Experience has assign'd as  specific  in a Distemper of such a Denomination and the Evacuations of the  Primae Viae  by gentle  Vomits  and  domestic Cathartics  as the Symptoms exasperat for tho' a Person may still suffer even when the Blood thus let out for Experiment's sake mostly appears on such gross Experiments tolerably good and not differing greatly from  sound Blood  in the Size the bad Juices being confin'd to the  Capillaries    Glands  and great  Viscera  yet these will never be open'd and render'd pervious till the Blood in the great Trunks of the Vessels be first attenuated  thin'd  and  sweeten'd  And he will never be long or uniformly well who has  bad Juices  circulating in these greater Vessels it is a certain  Symptom  that it must be much worse and more  sizy  in the small  lateral Branches  the  Capillaries  and the  Glands  of the  Viscera  and it is  Diet alone  and it chiefly join'd with mild ponderous Remedies at first  Evacuation    Air  and  Exercise  that can at last alter or  antidote  these morbific Symptoms And if after three Months Use of the Medicins advis'd in  chronical Cases  by an honest experienced Physician the Blood on such a Trial continues bad that is  sizy    liverish  with either too little  Serum  tho' clear or too much but  muddy  then I think the  trimming Diet  ought to be tried  viz  one of white Meat in a moderat Quantity once a Day with  Milk    Seeds  and  Vegetables  for the other Meals and  aqueous Beverage  or one Day a little plain Meat of any kind once a Day with  aqueous Beverage  that Day and the next Day only  Milk    Seeds  and  Vegetables  with about a  Gill  of some sound old Wine with or without Water and this  Regimen  with a due Care of the other  Nonnaturals  proper  Evacuation  and due  Exercise  I think ought to be continued for one whole Year or two in obstinat  hereditary chronical  Cases for I think acquir'd ones will scarce require so long Time or such Severity of  Regimen  to be cured or at least greatly alleviated unless their Excesses have been violent or that they are far advanced in Life  § BUT since such Cases do daily happen both in  hereditary  Distempers and those acquir'd by an obstinat  Malregimen  long continued in that after a full  Twelvemonth  or more of a  trimming  Regimen of Diet with proper  Evacuation  and  specific  Alteratives the Blood on makeing the Trial as above described continues still  bad  and  sizy  then I think all Medicin except domestic Evacuations or Alteratives may be fairly cashier'd and laid aside as of little or no Use and the whole Stress and Hope laid on  Diet  and  Regimen  only by sinking it in Quantity as well as Quality and confineing one's self to  Milk    Seeds    Fruits  and  Vegetables  well dress'd or much dissolv'd by  culinary  Fire to evaporat the Wind and drinking only  tepid Water  or some specific mineral Water as the Case requires and  Wine  only  as other Persons use Spirits on dangerous Symptoms as a Cordial and on Extremities and this  Method  and  Regimen  ought to be continued for  two Years  more at least And I think in Persons of a tolerable Constitution and where some of the  great Viscera  are not intirely spoil'd and irremediably consumed this Method and Diet cannot fail of having salutary Effects of a perfect Cure or a very considerable Relief and then if the Party is not past the  Meridian  of Life the Person may without Fear or Danger gradually and by slow Degrees rise again to the  trimming  Diet and from it return back again by the same Steps he descended into common Life and only on  Exacerbations  and stated Seasons sink into his lower Regimen for a Preservative  § BUT after all this Care and Perseverance in a  milk    seed  and  vegetable Diet  with  aqueous Beverage  if on a Trial after the manner mentioned the Blood be still sizy as it often is in bad Constitutions and obstinat Cases and the  Symptoms  still severe and depressing the only thing remaining for such a Person with any Reason or Expectation of Success of a total Cure or any notable Alleviation of his  Symptoms  is for the Person to enter on a  total rigid strict milk and seed Diet only  without Butter Eggs or any other Vegetables but Wheat Barley Rice Oats Sago and the like seed Meats and even to make his Milk the  thinnest possible skim'd Milk sweet Buttermilk sweet Whey or the Whey made with a Mixture of sour Milk or OrangeWhey or Whey made with the Juice of some specific Vegetable especially in  scorbutic    gouty    pulmonic  and  icteric  Cases which is the  Base  of most of the  chronical  Distempers in  England  and Bread or Seeds dress'd made with Milk only for Seeds are young Vegetables and are neither so hard of Digestion so windy nor abound with the  essential  Salts of Plants Roots and Fruits And even the  Quantity  of the  Regimen  is to be minded little at a time but oftener never either to load the Stomach nor compress the  Nerves    Membranes  and  Fibres  Fulness and Compression even by such Foods like  Stops  in  musical Chords  will interrupt their easy regular and  harmonious  Vibrations and Play and so will sink the Spirits and make the  Functions  labour This Regimen ought at last to be tried all other Methods not succeeding One would not buy  Gold too dear  but Health and free Spirits are more precious  than Gold  and a wise Man would give up every thing else for them This  Regimen  will infallibly have one of these two Effects it will either totally cure him if the great  Viscera  are not quite consumed or make him  lie down  more easily and will infallibly give him longer Time and better Spirits to settle his  temporal  Affairs and give all the Attention to his  future State  the Nature of Things will then admit  § MOST People that enter on a  low Diet  for Health and Spirits intirely  counter act  and  defeat  its beneficial Effects I have known some  Men  of  Quality  and  Gentlemen  of  Fortune  who have been advis'd a  low Diet  have their  Vegetables  of the  highest  and  rankest Flavour  dress'd high with  burnt Butter    hot Spices    Aromatics    Onions    Eggs  and  Salt  so that they were infinitly more deleterious and hurtful than a moderat Quantity of plain  animal  Food once a Day could possibly be The  meager  fasting and  Lent Times  among the  Catholicks  in  French    Italian  and  Spanish Cookery  with their high  Fish Sauces  will much sooner inflame the Blood produce  Gout    Stone  and  Fevers  than a  Bit  of Chicken  Veal    Lamb  or any white Meat plainly dress'd possibly can All the beneficial and salutary Effects of a  low  and  vegetable Diet  I have ever observ'd have been owing in atrocious obstinat and painful Distempers to  Milk  and  Seeds only  and even these the  thinnest  and the  least  the Person could be tolerably easy under from the Pain of Hunger And it is not easily to be credited what wonderful Effects even in the most desperat and universally  condemn'd  to  Death  Distempers I have seen perform'd by such a  Regimen  duly and obstinatly persisted in especially in Persons under Fifty  Epilepsies  totally cured  hereditary Gouts  almost eradicated  universal Lepers  made clean  Stones  in the  Bladder  and  Kidnies  laid quiet  Cancers  healed or palliated ulcerated  Lungs  made sound and  schirrous  Livers made pervious But all this has been constantly brought about by a total obstinat and continued milk and seed Diet only but in all such  incurable  Cases the Diet is to be persisted in to the last Day of Life for I have always observed when such return'd to a high or common Diet only their Distempers always return'd with greater  Violence  as in Reason and true  Philosophy  must have been expected For the Solids being brought down and relax'd to a Level and  Equilibrium  with such a Diet become infinitly sensible delicat and tender and such strong  Aliment  becomes an universal Stop and Obstacle to their Play and Vibrations like sticking down a  musical Chord  all along with  Pins  and interrupts marrs and confounds the whole  animal Functions  and  Oeconomy  and brings on all the old Symptoms enraged  § IT is true to live thus poorly  anxiously  and attentively is a most  miserable  kind of Life to which the  Brave  the  Bold  and the  Unbeliever  will brag he should prefer  Death  itself But I who give little Credit to such  Bounces  know  Selfpreservation  to be the great Law in Nature never met one but the true practical and habitual  Christian  among my many Patients and even scarce these who was truly willing and pleas'd to  strip  and lie  down and only him who was always resign'd to the Order of Providence either in  Life  or  Death  and even not  Him  at all Times and in the dark Moments of  Trial  or any but the extremely miserable in Life But here the Case is not mere  dying  but  living  a  dying Life  perhaps for many Years Here it is in two Evils  violent Pain  or extreme Lowness and Languishing or tolerable good Spirits and sufferable Pain at the Tax and Charge of a transient momentary sensual Gratification choosing the least on the other side it is a voluntary and a resolute withdrawing from the Orders and future unknown Designs of  Providence  over us when a very certain Mean at least in due Time of escaping or at least greatly diminishing these Miseries is offer'd In short not to take up with a low Regimen here is a plain Rebellion against the Orders and Designs of Providence manifested by Nature the Relations of Things  Philosophy  and Experience for the mere Gratification of vitious morbid Appetites In a word it is deliberat  Suicide  the greatest of all Rebellion and Sin  § IN  Lowness of Spirits  want of  natural Rest  great  Anxiety  involuntary dark and terrifying  Thoughts    Ideas  and Imaginations there are but these  three  infallible immediat Reliefs or Remedies A  Vomit  that can work briskly quickly and safely and Experience and Use can only determin what that  one shall be for it is not the  Evacuation  or Quantity of the Discharge that is to be so much minded as the  internal Action  the strong  Convulsion  the internal  Exercise  and the  cleaning  squeezeing and compressing the  knotted  and  tumified  Glands of the  Primae Viae  warm Water  Chamomile  or Carduus  Tea  and without drinking any thing I have often effected a present perfect Relief by mere urging and tickling the Throat and Glands with the Finger or a Feather by bringing the Muscles of the  Abdomen  into repeated  Efforts  and  Kecks  and so have frequently discharged Loads of  Phlegm  and thin  Rheum  which always greatly reliev'd and this Method frequently nay sometimes daily repeated and with greater Safety and less Trouble pursued will answer the Ends in tender and delicat Constitutions under a Regimen of formal and artificial Vomits and I earnestly recommend the Trial and frequent Practice of it to all tender lowliving  Valetudinarians  as what they will find infinit Benefit from and much easier and safer than artificial Apothecary Vomits when they have made the Practice of it easy and familiar The Strong and  Robust  whose  Fibres  are firm and  callous  will require stronger for a present Relief and they must be repeated whenever the Symptoms exasperat Great frequent and continued  Exercise  especially a  Horseback  because this Exercise by the frequent  Succussions  opens all the  Glands  of the  Abdomen  of the  Mesentery  and  Liver    where the Evil generally lies Walking because of the universal Action of all the  Solids  and its forceing the Perspiration is the best Exercise to  preserve Health  and  good Spirits  but  Riding  is best to recover them to this the  Fleshbrush  for half an Hour Morning and Night ought to be join'd to uncork the  Plugs  and concreted Recrements that stop the Mouths of the  perspiratory Glands  and then washing with  tepid Water  in  Winter  and  cold Water  in  Summer  the whole Skin to scour off these  Impurities  and drying well after and having always a large broad soft  Girdle  of Leather quilted with Cotton to wear about the  Loins  like a  Stay  or  Swaith  to keep the  Viscera  in their natural Situations the  Lacteals  and  Intestines  in their natural  Curvatures  and the  Bowels  from being too  pendulous  especially in thin and wasteing Persons Religiously to study and practice the  lightest  and the  least  of Food they can be tolerably easy under The least unnecessary Burthen  compressive  Constriction or Ligature on the tender delicat  Fibres    Nerves  or  Membranes  hinders their easy pleasant and natural  Play  and  Vibrations  which is the immediat Cause of  Lowness  and  Anxiety  it is like  nailing  or sticking down with  Pins  or  Stops  the  Play  of a  musical Chord  whence  Discord  must necessarily ensue In short to preserve or obtain  good Spirits  in very low Cases a Man must be in a constant  Course of  Selfdenial  as to  Aliment  and make as it were  Hunger  his greatest and only Pain but nothing but Experience and constant Observation of the  Juvantia  and  Laedentia  is sufficient to determin to each Individual respectively how far this is to be carried  Prudence  is the first of all Natural as well as  Christian Virtues    Gold  may be bought too dear but  wise Nature  always tells us how far this Method ought to be carried by the Intenseness of our Cravings when gone too far and then a Person under no unnatural or vitious  Passion  or  Lunacy  will obey her  Calls  by giving her what she  craves  so as to make her tolerably easy But these are the most general certain  Antidotes  against extreme Lowness and Anxiety known to me the Reliefs of  Art  and  Medicin  are not my Design at present here  § SOME Persons have found great Relief on Lowness a bad  Constitution  and  nervous  Distempers on Change to a  Southern  and warmer Climat from a  Northern  and colder But I never observ'd that Benefit dureable or in any Degree perfect unless the Party continued all the rest of his Days in that  Climat  and  Country  and tho' proper Air and Warmth be a most  comfortable  and  cherishing  thing to  animal  Bodies yet it is observing the Diet liveing in the manner of the Country that  contributes most to the Cure or Relief for it is well known that in warm Countries and  southern Climats  the Diet there is not only exceeding spare and  light  but almost altogether  Vegetables  The Heat and Rarefaction of the Air and constant Perspiration make a full high  rank  Diet certain Pain or Death And even the Materials of their Food there the  Animals  and  Vegetables  are lighter and less  rank  and destructive in their Nature and more stimulating the Natives scarce ever taste fermented or strong Liquors and indulging in them is the sole notorious Cause of the  sudden Deaths  of all our  Soldiers    Seamen  and  Traders  It is true  eastern  and  southern  Nations use many and the highest  Aromatics  with their Vegetables and they are but  dry Drams  of as pernicious a Nature almost as our liquid ones and this is the sole Cause of their  unnatural Lust  and  Leachery  of their  acute Distempers  and  short Lives  But when a  valetudinary  Person goes to a  southern  Country for his Health and lives as he used in his  northern  Country he rather grows worse for the  Climat  and if recover'd by the Air and Traveling and observing the  Regimen  peculiar to the Healthy in that  Climat  if he returns and does not continue the Regimen of Diet by which he was recover'd he falls back again and the  second  Error is worse than the  first  and in Truth to travel through or live even  a few Months or Years in a  southern  Climat and afterwards be obliged to pass his Life at Home in a  northern Climat  is but only roasting at the Fire or going strait out of a very hot Room into the cold Air to freeze and chill the faster and more intensely for  Reaction  is always equal to  Action  § As to the  Quantity  of Foods of any kind  strong    middling  or  weak  fittest to prolong Life and prevent or cure Diseases the most proper for each Individual there is no possible way to determin it to any Precision it must be different according to the  Size    Strength    Age    Constitution    Habitude    acquir'd  or  hereditary  Distempers of each Particular which are as various as their Faces  Wise Nature  had so contriv'd us had we follow'd her Simplicity and Order in our Diet that our  Appetites  and  Craveings  should be a sufficient  Rule  but having by long  Habitudes  and  Example  spoil'd corrupted and disorder'd her  Laws    Sensations  and  Order  she is not  now  in all Cases sufficient to determin this Affair The best  Rules  I think a wise Man can folfollow are To use the plainest most tender least  poignant  and savoury Meats fully dress'd he can find and to abate in  Quantity  what he is forced to increase in the  Quality  of his Food To take the  least  possible he can be tolerably easy under from the Pain of  Hunger  To observe for some Time and with some Care what  Foods  in Quantity and Quality he is easiest under and the natural  Rest  the natural  Secretions  and the animal Functions labour  least  and are most pleasantly perform'd under To observe the  Quantity  after the great Meal he can apply his  Head  his  Attention  and his  Body  to their proper Offices with the greatest Facility and Pleasure under To follow the Quantity and Quality of those Foods that give him regularly one figur'd  Stool  a Day only For  one Month  to try double the Quantity or at least one  third  or less more than he us'd of the same kinds of Food and observe what Difference this makes in his  Functions    Intellectual  or  Animal  and by some repeated Trials of this kind summing up the whole and takeing the  half  of this Quantity divided by the Number of Days as the  Medium  between the least or greatest Quantity To try by a  Sanctorian  Chair the Quantity and Quality of those Foods that perspire the  most  and  soonest  and reduce the Body to pretty near always the same Weight Or Lastly Without Care Anxiety or Perplexity to study and pursue the  lightest  and  least  of Food he can possibly be easy under for without all doubt Nature will to a Man of a sober Mind and in his right Senses by acute and intolerable Pains from  Hunger  apprize him at least in some time if he has underdos'd  her So far may suffice to an honest prudent Person as to the Quantity of Food or the Materials of the  Curd  of the Blood As to the  Liquids  or the Materials of the  Serum  I am perfectly convinced Nature never intended any thing but  pure Water    Water  being  signatur'd  by its greatest  Fluidity  and  Insipidity  for carrying  alimentary  Particles readily and pleasantly through all the strait  Meanders  of  animal  Life and having design'd fermented Liquors and the Juices of  Fruits  and  Vegetables  for  Physic  only and they are when us'd with Intemperance or as common Beverage the sole universal and adequat  natural Cause  of most acquir'd Distempers and Waterdrinking only the proper and adequat  Antidote  for such But if a Man will drink vinous and fermented Liquors then the best are those that are of a middling Strength the  lightest    oldest  and  ripest  which have spent or drop'd their  saline    tartarous  and grossest Particles by Age and Maturity on which Account the old  Rhenish  or  Hock  ripe  Claret  or  Burgundy  neat old  Port  and  Madera  will be preferable and the rich fat fiery oily and gross Wines are only to be us'd as  Cordials  and  Drams  on Necessity and Extremity But always the least is the very best of all fermented Liquors whatsoever  § WHOEVER can resolve in  bad Spirits  a bad Constitution and in advanced Life  to go into a Regimen may I think fairly be manumitted from  Drugs  that is from any kind of Alteratives even the Preparations of  Mercury    Steel    Antimony    Sulphur  and all those of the ponderous and mineral Kind they will only tear and rend his tender Bowels and Vessels and even from every sort of the  violent  and  active  kind and trust simply to Nature and domestic  Evacuation  as the  Symptoms  exasperat  viz  little  Bleedings  gentle and weak  Emetics  Stomach  Purges    mineral  Waters of a proper kind gentle Air and Exercise and a  Regimen  of the  lightest  and  least  no regular Meals but a little at a time and oftner for as Nature will not now on its  Decline  bear the violent and  active  Remedies without being torn to pieces so there is not sufficient Time in Life remaining for strong Health and they must consider what Nature can  bear  and  do  and follow her by their  Feelings  rigidly and treat themselves as  Children  the  second  time by giving her barely the  lightest  and the  least  she can be tolerably easy under and always endeavouring to lessen the Quantity and Quality of the Diet as her  active  and  digestive  Powers weaken and decrease for one Day tolerably easy by the Strength of  Nature  only will be better than two such by the Help of Art for her  Recovery  and prolonging her Life  § IN a  low Regimen  even when upon Necessity and under prudent  Counsel  and Advice when a Person has enter'd upon it and has continued in it for a long time they may have many  Plunges    Discouragements  and  Exacerbations  especially as the peccant Matter becomes collected from the Mass of Blood by the greater  Glands  and is now soliciting to be  pumped  off or driven out by the  Commonsewer  besides Accidents the  Inclemency  and Alterations of the  Seasons  especially  Spring  and  Autumn  when  animal  as well as  vegetable  Nature undergoes some notable Alterations none ought to be so scrupulously nice as not at such a Time to lay aside their  low  Milk and  Seed  or  vegetable  Diet and take to a little  white  Meat and fermented Liquors upon  Nausea    Inappetency  and transiently to  brace  the Solids to get Strength to throw off the still remaining Load of  Morbosity  and  Viscosity  this is but like standing to take a little Breath in ascending a  steep  Mountain But then they ought as soon as this periodical  Paroxysm  is remov'd by proper Evacuation and this temporary  braceing Regimen  to return to their  cooling    soft    sweetning  and  thinning  Diet in order to purify the Juices totally This  Interruption  will only retard the  Cure  a short time and will give Strength to perfect it at last as far as the  Nature  of Things will permit For it is to be believ'd  as a  certain Truth  without which no Patient will be encouraged to proceed that it is to a low cool thin  Diet  alone with proper and indicated Evacuation that the Blood is to be at last mended and the highest Health the Constitution will permit is to be obtain'd  § To  conclude  this tedious Detail of the two  animal Food  or  fermented Liquors  either of any kind that is in Use if my Opinion were to be  ask'd  Which of the  two  is most pernicious to  animal  Bodies or in which of the  two  Mistakes or  Excesses  are most pernicious fatal and most productive of the  severe  Distempers I would not hesitate a Moment to ascribe to  fermented  or  distill'd  Liquors of any kind the whole Blame of all or most of the painful and  excruciating  Distempers that afflict Mankind It is to it alone all our  Gouts    Stones    Cancers    Fevers  high  Hysterics    Lunacy  and  Madness  are principally owing It is the true  Pandora  's Box And he who would timeously give up while he is tolerably well  fermented  Liquors and drink nothing but  pure tepid Water  need never seek nor want any other  Cure  or  Medicin  but gentle and proper  Evacuation  occasionally be his Distemper what it will He may then freely give up any Concern about what he should  eat  let him without Fear follow Nature and his Appetite in whatever plain Meat is presented  he can be in no Danger from any  fatal  or dangerous Distemper Waterdrinking to those that are already tolerably well begun early at least under Thirtyfive or after when no  chronical    hereditary    mortal  Distemper is rooted is the true and universal  Panacea  and the  Philosopher  's  Stone God  has not only  permitted  but by a wife Appointment of his Providence has in many Cases made  animal  Food absolutely necessary and indispensable and for great  high Health  and  Spirits    warm  and strong Blood bodily  Prowess  and great  Labour  it is the only proper Food but for  fermented  Liquors I know no Command Counsel or Example Certainly  wise Nature  who has provided liberally Supplies for all our Wants has furnish'd us none of it it is the Invention of spurious and luxurious Art and it is present Death to  many  and the natural  Aversion  of all Animals who follow pure Nature It certainly shortens the Duration of  Life  to all that use it even with  Moderation  and is the alone  adequat  Cause of all the  mortal  painful and atrocious Distempers As a Medicin present Relief and as a  bitter Chalybeat Potion  on Occasions and Extremities it might be a tolerable  Medicin  but as common Beverage it is a slow but certain Poison  FOR a  Conclusion  I will from the whole set down a few  Aphorisms  that may perhaps  instruct and ease the Memory of the  Valetudinarian  Aphorism  A CONSTANT Endeavour after the  lightest  and the  least  of Meat and Drink a Man can be tolerably easy under is the  shortest  and most infallible  Mean  to preserve  Life    Health  and  Serenity  Aph  HE that would preserve a  clear Head  and equal Spirits must keep his  Stomach  clean his  Bowels  moderatly empty and uncomprest  Aph  ON  bad Nights    Lowness    Flatulence  and Oppression of  Spirits  of any Continuance the only certain  Reliefs  are a small  Phlebotomy  a gentle  Vomit  a  domestic Purge    rideing  a Horseback and a  Regimen  of the  lightest  and the  least  persisted in  Aph  SMALL frequent  Phlebotomies  are the quickest and most effectual Mean to mend the  Blood  and to cure  Cacochymy  if a  Regimen  of the lightest and least be joined  Aph  GENTLE and repeated Evacuation upwards and downwards especially and perhaps only  Vomits  by the Medicins most familiar and experienced the  Action  and Exercise of Vomiting is its chief Use are the  surest    quickest  and most effectual Mean to prevent or remedy the ill Effects of Gluttony Overloading and Repletion that is almost all chronical Distempers provided the  lightest  and the  least  be join'd afterwards  Aph    DISEASES  are always to be cured by their  Contraries  the  high Diet  by the  low  the  hot  by the  cool  the  sapid  by the  insipid  the  thick  and gross by the  thin  and poor  Repletion  by  Fasting    Inactivity  by  Exercise  Health acquir'd and possessed lies in the middle Regimen between these two  Extremes  Aph    PERFECT Health  and  good Spirits  depend chiefly if not only on the easy and pleasant Play or Performance of the  Animal Functions    viz  the  Digestion    Circulation    Respiration    Perspiration    muscular Motion  and the  Secretions  Aph  HE that would be soon  well  must be long  sick  that is treat himself as a  Valetudinarian  in most things  Aph    EXERCISE  and  gentle Evacuation  will supply the Place of  Abstinence  and  Abstinence  will supply the Place of  Evacuation  but the first two are still preferable because they damage the  Solids  least  Aph    QUANTITY  in Food will supply  Quality  and  Quality  will supply the Place of  Quantity  but in very bad Cases it is most secure to join  both  Aph  THERE is but little in a  specific Regimen  of  Diet  to remedy or antidot a  specific Distemper    Abstinence  in general or a constant Endeavour after the  lightest  and the  least  will constantly supply the Place of any  specific  particular  Regimen  of Diet But in very bad Cases a particular  Choice  of the most  specific Regimen  that  Art    Experience  and  Philosophy  shew to be most proper is not to be neglected  Aph  THE  Regimen of Diet  by which one is cured of a particular Distemper ought to be coninued at least in some Degree especially if the Person is not much under  Fifty  else the Distemper will return with more severe and worse  Symptoms  than at first as  Experience  has constantly shew'd  Aph  Every  wise  Man after  Fifty  ought to begin to lessen at least the  Quantity  of his  Aliment  and if he would continue free of great and dangerous Distempers and preserve his  Senses  and  Faculties  clear to the  last  he ought every seven Years go on abateing  gradually and sensibly and at last  descend  out of Life as he  ascended  into it even into the Child's Diet  Aph  He that is  old  when he is young that is treats himself as a wise  old Man  does or ought to do by great  Temperance    Air  and  Exercise  if he lives past Thirtyfive will be young when he grows old in Years  Aph  No Person of any Fortune ever died or suffer'd  acute  Pains or mortal Distempers by the  too cool    too little  or too  insipid  in Diet all by the  too hot    high  and  savoury  But Virtue and Health lie in the  golden Mean  so difficult to be found and only to be secur'd by the  lightest  and the  least  a Man can be tolerably easy under  Aph  THE eternal  Law  of Nature by intense Pain in  Craveing  and  Hunger  will never suffer a Person in his right Senses to go on long obstinatly and to his Hurt in the  too little  Aph    WATER pure    clear and insipid  is the sole  Beverage  that can procure or continue  Health  and a  clear Head  being the  sole  Fluid that will pass through the smallest animal  Tubes  without Resistance next to it are  aqueous  or weak fermented Liquors  Aph    WATER tepid or cold  or impregnated with the  specific Vegetables  or  Minerals  that Experience has found proper to  antidot  a given Distemper is the true  Panacea  in both  acute  and  chronical Distempers  Nature has prepared no other  Medicin  for us but Water impregnated with  Vegetables  in their  Juices  or natural  Mineral  Waters on the Surface of the Earth  Aph    MILK  is the only  Food  prepared by Nature for young that is weak and tender  animal  Bodies and there is no real Difference between a  young    tender    animal Body  and a diseased grown  Animal  but that of the  two  the  last  is the worst but it will cost Labour and Patience to make  Milk  agree in  bilious  Cases  Aph    MILK  and sweet sound Blood differ in nothing but in  Colour Milk  is  Blood  which almost directly comes from the Chyle into the Teats of the  Animal  and  Blood  is  Milk  which has gone many Rounds in the  Circulation  and is ground a little in the  Lungs  where being mixt with the  Nitre  of the Air it receives its  Scarlet  Colour it is a Medium between  animal  and  vegetable  Food  Aph  WHEY sweet or medicated with the Juice of any  specific  Plant Sage Balm or  Orange or antiscorbutic vulnerary or pulmonic Plants will supply the Place and are preferable to most Decoctions of Plants Infusions  Apozems  and  DietDrinks  whatsoever except those of the strong Detergents as  HorseRadish    MustardSeed  and the like where necessary  Aph    GOATS Whey  being a natural Infusion from gentle Heat and gentle  Triture  of the fine  aromatic  and  nitrous  Vegetables on which  Goats  feed only is one of the very best Diluents Detergents Cleansers and Sweetners of  scorbutic  and  salin Cacochymies  Aph    FRICTION  Morning and Night and in Winter Washing with warm and Drying before a Fire and in Summer with cold Water is an excellent  Mean  to facilitat and promote the Perspiration to clean the  Cuticle  and cure  cutaneous  Uncleanness and  Defedations    cold Batheing  is excellent and preferable to every Washing in Cases where the Blood is sweet and thin the Solids too lax only  Aph    CINCTURE  with a broad quilted Belt about the Loins to keep the  Bowels  in their natural Situations and the  chylous Vessels  in their best  Locality  and in flabby Constitutions weak  Bowels  and  Atrophies  is of great Benefit  Aph RIDEING  is the best of all Exercises to get Health and to promote the  Digestions  especially in  nervous Distempers  where the  Abdomen  and the  Meseraic Glands  are principally affected But  Walking  is best to preserve Health already got because it is the most natural and the most universal Promoter of all the Excretions  Aph  IN  Nature  or  Art  there is no such immediat Cure for low Spirits Anxiety and Want of Sleep as rideing a Horseback long Journies with Fasting or rather a very soft light Feeding with warm thin Liquors at RestingPlaces but that the least possible that actual  Fainting  will permit  Aph  NEXT to  Rideing  is either a  Vomit  or Fasting almost to Faintness and then only a little spiced Wine and Water warm and a Mouthful or two of  dry Bisket  every th or th Hour with continued  Friction  with a coarse Cloth warm Flannel or a FleshBrush especially on the  Spine  in  Faintings  and extreme  Lowness  Aph  TO procure  natural Rest  nothing is like four or five middling Pills of true  Assafoetida  with four or five Grains of pure succatrine Aloe taken going to Bed  Aph  THE only Way to secure tolerable  Spirits  in very low Cases is a constant Endeavour to make Hunger the greatest Pain and to cheat the  Appetite  and Craveing with little warm light Liquors at large Intervals  Aph GOOD Hours  will be always a most beneficial Mean to preserve Health and Spirits to go to Bed by Ten and rise by Six  Aph  WHOSOEVER would preserve his Health and Spirits to the last even when he is in Possession of it ought to pass through the great Operations of  Physick  in the  Spring    viz  To  bleed    vomit  and  purge  whether he have apparent Necessity or not for  Seurvy  or  scorbutick Juices  is the great chronical and fundamental Distemper of  Britain  all the rest are but Sprouts and Branches of it And therefore  Aph VOMITS  often repeated at least as often as the Symptom of any Ail aggravats increases or exasperats are the sole  universal Antidot  and  Panacea  of  Britain  an ailing Person cannot repeat  them  too often they will always prove beneficial and  salutary  Aph  IN  cold Feet  nothing like batheing them in tepid Water a little before going to Bed  Aph  A  low Diet  seldom extirpats or totally eradicats any  hereditary chronical  Distemper unless it be in the young the middlingaged or the strong and healthy who have otherwise tolerable  Stamina  in the very  puny  delicat and  slender  in the  old  and far advanced in Life even after Fifty in the strongest it only abates the Violence of their  Symptoms  makes them less severe and the Returns seldomer and only prolongs the Duration of their Lives  Aph  THE natural Diseases of the  Poor  and  Necessitous  are generally owing to a  bad  unwholesome unsound Diet and the Want of due Care of the other  Nonnaturals  Cleanness and Shelter and are generally cured by their  Contraries    viz  a good  wholesome  plain Diet and a due Cleanness Shelter from the Inclemency of Seasons and an easy Mind  Aph  IF it happen that the  Poor  and those having no Property of their  own  by  Stealth    Robbery  or  unlawful  Means enter on and pursue the  Luxury  of the  Rich  and Opulent not having the other Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life neglecting or not being able to afford or being inured to want the necessary Care of the other  Nonnaturals  their Diseases are then the most  atrocious    painful and miserable of any which is the Reason that the  acute  and  contagious  Distempers begin first spread faster and are more  mortal  among  them  than those of the better Sort  Aph    DIET  a proper well regulated and parsimonious cool Diet is the far greatest  Article  of long Life and Health but the other  Nonnaturals  are to be carefully attended to and guarded against else it will not avail alone which is the Case in  Monasteries    Desarts  and long  Sea Voyages  DISCOURSE I Philosophical CONJECTURES ABOUT THE NATURE and QUALITIES OF THE Original Animal Body AND OF ITS PROGRESSIVE STATE IN ITS Several Stages of EXISTENCE  Cor xv  There is a natural Body and there is a spiritual Body  DISCOURSE I  Philosophical CONJECTURES ABOUT THE NATURE and QUALITIES OF THE Original Animal Body AND OF ITS PROGRESSIVE STATE IN ITS Several Stages of EXISTENCE  § THERE are  Animalcules  which being endued with Life and Motion must consequently perform  Animal Functions  that are less than any Object perceptible by our Senses  THIS is beyond all Doubt from  Microscopical  Discoveries in  Pepper Water    Spring Water    Vinegar    Sperm  the  Urine  and fluid Juices of almost all morbid Animals and  Mr  Lewenhoeck  has shewn that there are Animals many Thousands of which would not equal a visible Grain of Sand and that there are  Tubes  in Animals of which several Hundreds would not equal a common Hair and the smallest  Animals  to carry on Life must necessarily have all the chief  Organical  Parts of the greatest Animals at least  analogically  § An  organized  Animal Body could not possibly at first have been formed nor can its  Functions  be now accounted for or explained by mere  Mechanism  or the Laws of Motion which now obtain without the Sagacity and Agency of a  primary selfexistent  Cause nor can the  Functions  be continued without the Superintendance and Influence of a  selfmoving    selfacting secondary Agent  informing and acting on it continually  THIS is not only demonstrable from the  Inertia  and Passivity of Matter from the obvious Contradiction of a  perpetual circular  Motion which is the Case of all Animals the Motion of the  Heart  and the  Muscular  Force of the BloodVessels being the Cause of the  Circulation  and the  Circulation  being the Cause efficient or occasional of the Motion of the  Heart  and of the  Muscular  Fibres But that mere  Mechanism  acts only according to the  Surfaces  of Bodies and yet it is probable  that animated Bodies act according to their  Solidities  and that every  Atom  of an animated Body is constantly in Action for the Preservation and Wellbeing of the whole  Machin  and also for exerting that particular  Animal Function  which its Figure Situation and Use in the Animal requires Besides natural and simple  Mechanism  can act only from One  Centre  of Motion or Impulse in One single  Direction  only whereas  Curvature  requires different Direction every Moment and consequently various  Centres  of Motion or Impulse Now if we consider the Varieties of Motions and Directions in the Joints and Muscles of Animals but especially the  infinite  Variety of  Curvatures  in the  Arteries    Veins  and  Nerves  and particularly in the  Glands  we will readily perceive it to be utterly impossible and a Contradiction that an Animal Body could have been at first  formed  without a  Supramechanical Organisation  or that it should continue to  live  and perform  Animal Functions  without the continual Agency and Superintendance of a  secondary  selfactive and selfmotive Principle  § It is highly probable that the first  Elements  of Bodies or the  least  and  last  Particles of Matter are  solid    hard  and  indivisible  by any  finite  Power or Force whatever because by  Friction    Collision  and  Use    they are not worn out and lose not their  Original  Figure and Size since they are still fit for the Ends and Purposes of their first Institution  § GOD and  Nature  do nothing in vain and since  Body  must necessarily be always endued with some Figure being neither infinitely small nor infinitely great where Figure may possibly be thought to evanish the three most simple Figures of all solid Bodies  viz Spheres    Cubes  and  equilateral triangular Prisms  might possibly at first have made all the Diversities of the primitive original Particles of  specific  Bodies These Figures with the particular Laws of  Attraction  and  Union  thence arising together with different  Diameters  and various  Combinations  may have made all the Differences of Bodies  § THE several  Elements  or the several  Aggregats  or Masses of the different original Particles now commonly called  Elements  as  Water    Air    Light    Salt  and  Earth  have each some specifick Qualities which distinguish them from each other and which they never entirely lose in any State whatsoever but which may be swallowed up and rendered unactive when blended and combined with other Particles as they are in the  integral  Particles of natural Bodies as these are constituted in this our  System  WATER has its Incompressibility the Rotundity or at least the  Spheroidity  of its constituent Particles its Transparency or refractive Power its Admission of  Salts  into its Substance without greatly increasing its Dimensions at least in a certain Quantity and Proportion nay sometimes lessening them  AIR has its Elasticity its  repulsive  Force its  acid  and  nitrous  Spirit and its  vivifying  Quality to Fire and Animal Life  LIGHT has its Activity Velocity Tenuity of its Particles and its Fitts of easy  Transmission  and  Reflection  and probably a greater Gravity or  Byas  on one Side than the other of its Particles  SALT has its Solubility in Water only its penetrating Virtue on Bodies and its stimulating Quality on  animal Fibres  A greater Degree and particular Law of the  attractive  Force of its Particles on one another whereby its  Clusters  are generally of regular and nearly similar Figures terminated by plain Surfaces  EARTH has its greater Gravity loose Connexion and less Attraction of its Particles its Friability and irregular Figure being probably the  Ramenta  or  Abrasions  of the other  Elements  PERHAPS the  primitive Animal Body  might consist of the  First  pure specific and sublimed  Elements  harmoniously combined and elegantly ranged in their Original Natures of which our present patch'd gross Bodies are only the confused dense Kind as our present Globe of  Earth  its  Water    Salt    Air    Light  and  Earth  are but probably the  putrified  Carcase of the primitive  Planet  but both may continue to have some remote  Analogy  to one another as a Carcase hath to a living Beauty or an  Egyptian Mummy  to a living  Cleopatra  ACCORDING to this  Analogy  then may not the Matter and Substance of the original firstcreated  Vehicle  or Animal Body be of such Elements of the original Kind of a  celestial  and  spiritual  Nature so to speak infinitely more subtile and refined than the Matter of  Light  more elastick than the finest  Aether  and whose Particles might have had as it were an infinite Power of  Attraction  even at finite Distances and consequently might pervade all gross Bodies of our  System  without Resistance or Pain  § On such an  analogous  Supposition or Conjecture the Fineness Elasticity and Law of  Attraction  in the Particles of such a  spiritual Animal  Matter might admit of Degrees  as all Finites must necessarily do and the Degree might be in Proportion to the natural and moral Powers of the Spirit conjunctly  IT seems highly probable that all finite created  Spirits  have and must have material  Vehicles  of Purity and Fineness in Proportion to their natural and moral Powers conjunctly not only to limit and direct their  Energy  and Efficiency but to  commerciate  with other Animals and inanimat created Natures none but the Supreme Spirit  the Father of Spirits  being absolutely and entirely an infinitely pure  immaterial Spirit  acting by his Power and Energy with equal Facility at all possible Distances And the  Vehicles  or original Bodies of all created Spirits might possibly be of some such Nature as this described Matter which may be called  spiritual Matter  or  Element  § This  spiritual animal Body  at first divinely organized may be rolled up folded together and contracted in this present State of its Duration into an infinitely small  Punctum Saliens  into a  Miniature  of a  Miniature in infinitum  lodg'd in the Loins of the Male of all Animals for it is highly probable the Female was but a  secondary  Intention or a  Buttress  to a falling Edifice and proceeding in a  diverging Series  and progressive Gradation that in due Time it may be fit to be nourished  and increased by the Juices of the proper Female and thereby enabled to bear the Coarseness and Injuries of this  ruinous Globe  and gross Element to which it is to be condemned for a certain Period  § IT would seem that this  spiritual Body  of this refin'd subtile Matter divinely organized by an infinite Degree of  Attraction  to its particular informing  Spirit  and by an individual  Fitness  and  Congruity  to the specific immaterial Inhabitant is so intimately united with it in its original  Creation  that they are  never  after to be separated whatever future State they may go into by any finite Power whatsoever no more than the Firmness and Solidity of the primitive original  Atoms  of of Matter can be broken or divided by any natural Power So that in whatever Afterstates it may exist or whatever  Plaister  or Vehicle of a denser and coarser Element may be superinduced the  spiritual  Inhabitant and the  primitive  CreationBody go inseparably together And as this refined spiritual Body might have been the  Creation  primitive Body so it may purified develop'd and mundify'd become the last  Resurrection  and  glorify'd  Body  § It seems highly probable  analogous  to the other Appearances of Nature and congruous to rational Agency if we suppose the first Being  rational    intelligent  and  wise  acting  with Designs and Purposes that the confining of  intelligent  or  sentient  Beings for so long a Time to so dark and strait a Prison in the Origin Seeds and Eggs of Animals on this  ruinous Globe  must have been for some wise and good End and Purpose in God's  moral  Government of his int ligent and sentient Creatures perhaps for  Punishment  Correction progressive Purification and painful Sensation  A Body hast thou given me  was said of our  Saviour  to make him passive  Feeling and Experience  being the most effectual Mean to admonish and teach finite wandering and heedless Beings at least this seems one Part of the Design  § THAT in our present Scene of Existence our  natural Powers  are tied down sopited and fettered by the Manner of our  Origination  and coming into rational Life is selfevident The wisest and best Man on the Earth as to rational and intelligent Living was first like a mere  Vegetable  or  Plant  afterward a mere  Animal  or  Brute  and but at last very late and only for a short Time the rational and  complete Man  and this Truth might be further illustrated and even demonstrated from the Qualities of  Matter  which are contrary to and destructive of the Qualities of  Spirit  Now this Progression must have some End and Purpose in the Intention of a wise and good Cause and may suppose that by the Abuse of Liberty and  idolatrising the Creatures the  moral Powers    Justice    Goodness    and Truth  being erased and cancell'd in the  Spirit  the most effectual Mean and Expedient to restore them was to tye down contract and sopite the  natural Powers  of the Soul  Living    Perceiving    and Willing  to a  Level  and Equality with these defaced  moral Powers  that by the Use of the proper Means they might without Letts or Obstacles from these  natural Powers  gradually improve and grow up together in the same Degree and Order at least this may be One not improbable End and Design of Providence in this  progressive  Growth of the natural Powers of the human Spirit since it is evident in Fact that where the  natural and moral Powers  of the Soul rise to any Degree this Progression is observed  § The  Works  of God are without Repentance the true unbodied Spiritual Substance in intelligent and sentient Natures being an  Emanation    Efflux    Ray  or  Spark  or if I durst use such figurative Language an  infinitesimal Miniature  of his  Substance  and of his  living    perceiving and willing  or whole Nature who is  Selfexistent  After flowing from him can no more  perish  or cease to  live    perceive  and  will  than necessary Selfexistence can cease to be so that  Living    Perceiving and Willing  i e  Cogitation  can never be totally extinct in any intelligent and sentient Being Never in the  Root    Faculty  or  Power    tho' they may be and often are in the  Acts  like Fire in Ashes  Annihilation  is contradictory to and destructive of infinite Wisdom and Power and unworthy of infinite Perfection requiring the same  Omnipotence  that  Creation  does  Reaction  being always equal to Action And  Selfactivity  being an  infinitesimal Miniature  of necessary Existence and Omnipotence The  first Being  might as justly be supposed capable of destroying Himself as his  Miniature  Images Besides it were neither wise nor good even in a  Man  to suffer the  Heir Apparent  of a great Kingdom to destroy or annihilate himself if it were possible by Correction Restraints Time and due Culture to fit him for the Possession and sure every Thing that is wise and good is possible to the  best  of Beings These  Natural Powers  may be sopited contracted and hindred from issuing into Action as we see they are in sound Sleep in some Diseases  Syncope  's and many other Cases by Obstacles of and Resistances from gross Matter by Bonds Fetters and Chains made of these our  Elements  and the coarser and straiter these Fetters and Chains are the straiter and closer the Prison may be and the weaker and fewer may be the Acts of the natural Powers till this Prison become almost dead Matter and a  Dungeon  or a mere Point Now infinite Wisdom and Power being as it were necessitated by the infinite  Benevolence  of his Nature to lay out all the  Energy of his Omnipotence and Omniscience to recover and restore his Miniature Images consistent with the  Harmony  of his own Attributes and with the Usage of their natural Powers neither of which he could force or offer Violence to seems to have contrived this wonderful Expedient  viz  to tye down sopite and restrain the Acts and Exertion of the natural Powers of laps'd  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings for a determin'd Space of Time by Chains and Fetters made of the  Elements  of this ruinous  Globe  in order to punish and purify them and so to vindicate his  Sovereignty  to repair the Indignity done to his  Purity  to warn and deter the other Orders of his standing  Hierarchies  and at the same Time by lessening the Strength and Activity of the natural Powers in their full Vigour to allow Freedom and Uninterruption from them for the Restoration and Advancement of the moral Powers  § WERE the  natural Powers  of a free laps'd and intelligent Being greatly and eminently higher than the  moral Powers  in the present State they must necessarily clash with interrupt and greatly hinder the Acquisition of the moral Powers For  Example  unerring Evidence irrefragable Demonstration absolute Certainty must necessarily interfere with  Humility    Dependence    Resignation    Faith  and  Trust  and consequently with all Merit Gratitude  and Love What Faith What Resignation What Merit is there in believing the Propositions of  Euclid  In this we are as much passive in our immaterial Principle as in our Material We trust our Lives and Fortunes to a Seaman or Coachman not on Demonstration and absolute Certainty but because we believe them to be  honest  able Persons in their several Vocations Faith and Hope must eternally exclude  Mathematical  Certainty Perfect Demonstration and absolute Certainty would exclude Choice Election and Preference in finite dependent Creatures It is  Probability  alone  Verisimilitude    Analogy  and  final Causes  or  Revelation  that can be the proper Evidence to produce  Faith  and to give Merit Choice Election and Preference to the Actions of finite laps'd and dependent Creatures and this whole present Scene of Providence and the Darkness Obscurity and seeming Deformity on the Face of Nature and the Works of an Allwise Allgood Being seem only contrived and calculated to preserve the natural Powers of lapsed finite Intelligences  inviolate  and at the same Time to  harmonise  with the Divine Attributes For had the  natural  Powers continued in their Perfection and full Extent while the  moral  Powers were cancell'd and extinguish'd they could never have been restored consistent with the Harmony of the Divine Attributes and the natural  unperishable and inviolable Powers of free Intelligences Liberty to do Good or Evil  PreExistence  abus'd universal  Restoration  and final  Confirmation  consistent with the Harmony of the  Divine Attributes  and the  natural Powers  of lapsed Intelligences well explain'd will remove all the possible Difficulties and Obscurity in Nature Providence and Revelation  § To comprehend ascertain and demin with  Precision  and  Mathematical  or  Metaphysical  Certainty the real Nature or Substance of any thing small or great is incompatible with  Finitude  and the sole incommunicable Attribute of the  Deity  and if lapsed finite Creatures such as we of the human Race are supposed to be could attain to it it would destroy our Liberty to act whose very  Essence  consists in doing any thing or its contrary and determin us infallibly to one  Tenour  of Action as certainly as one Impulse or one  Centre  of  Motion  in a Body would determine it to one  Direction  or in a Right Line and consequently would counteract our  Recovery  and  Restoration  and render it impossible And the most perfect  Cherubim  in Heaven to perpetuate and  eternise  its Happiness must necessarily have made a surrendry and sacrifice of its  Will  to infinite Goodness and its  Understanding  to infinite Wisdom and tho' all that are admitted to the  Beatific Vision    see God Face to Face  or  see as they are seen  yet it can be only  pro Modulo suo  and tho' the  Faith  and Trust necessary to us here in our uncertain lapsed probatory State when we come to  Glory shall be done away  yet  naked Faith  or a  Faith  founded solely on the  Ipse Dixit  of infinite Perfection as well as  pure Love  or love of Infinite  Perfection  for itself or for its own  Amiability  is indispensibly necessary even in Heaven to perpetuate and  eternise  the Felicity of the most perfect  Seraphim  As our bodily Eyes are utterly incapable of perceiving the  real  and  positive  Magnitude Dimensions and Distance of material Objects nothing but their  relative  ones so is the most sublime and perfect created Understanding for ever incapable to discover and comprehend the  precise  Nature  Essence  or Qualities of the  First  Being or of any of his  lowest  Works  Objects  are perceiv'd or comprehended not according to their own absolute  precise  and  positive  Nature by created Understandings of any  Order  and  Degree  but  respectively  and  relatively  according to the  Degree  and  Extent  of  their  Faculties and yet a  Miniature  may be truly a Picture and as just an one in  small  as one at  length  and between the  First  Being and the absolute Nature of his Works as conceiv'd and comprehended by  creaturely  Faculties there will be allways the Proportion of  Infinite  to  Finite  And when  Jesus Christ  said he was the  Truth  the  absolute Truth  he as really affirm'd his  Divinity  as when he said  he that hath seen me    hath seen the Father  or  I and the Father are one  for the absolute  precise Metaphysical Truth  of real positive Things is inseparable from the  Divine Nature  and he could not be honest and sincere even as a  Creature  if in such a  momentuous  and and fundamental  Point  he could lead Creatures into a Mistake an honest Person would have trembled to come so near plain  Blasphemy  and yet he says his Words  are Spirit and Truth  But I beg Pardon for this Digression out of the Sphere of Philosophy  § THE subjecting  material  Bodies the outward Creation and perhaps spiritual Natures to  general  and invariable Laws the continuing these under the  Lapse  which were and must have been establish'd in the State of Innocence I say the Continuance of these seems to be another Expedient of infinite Wisdom to preserve Liberty in the Recovery of the moral Powers of lapsed Intelligences and to conciliate the  Harmony  of the Divine Attributes Without these general Laws discoverable only to any Degree by just  Observation    calm Attention    accurate Experiment  extensive  Induction  and  Calculation  there could be no Room for Correction Amending for  Choice  and  Election  or for moral  Good  and  Evil  but Things would happen in the  intellectual and  moral System  as they are supposed to happen in the  natural System  on the  Epicurean  Scheme by  Chance    Casualty  Fits and Starts or fatal Necessity which is absolutely to deny the  first Being  to be a rational intelligent and free Agent for infinite Wisdom can do nothing but for  wise  Ends and Purposes and must contrive Means which have a natural and necessary Tendency and Fitness for these Ends If these Means be not seen by us or being in some measure seen may seem not to attain their Ends it is because being finite  lapsed  Creatures our narrow Capacities cannot reach them or because all the  Conditions  requisite to make them effectual were not present in a particular Case for infinite Wisdom must act uniformly with  Order    Number    Weight  and  Measure  all which nothing but general Laws and Canons can effect as is well known to  Geometers  and plainly exemplified in the universal  Canons  of  Algebra  If these general Laws be duly investigated cautiously guarded and all the necessary  Conditions  be taken in they can never fail of obtaining their End and Effect unless infinite Wisdom and Power  suspend  them for a limited Time to manifest his Power or for moral Ends and Purposes or unless they are kept from attaining their natural Ends directly by the voluntary and free  Agency  of imperfect human Intelligences  § THE only Thing worthy of a true  Philosopher  is with Attention to draw up and collect as many as he possibly can of these  general Laws  of the Divine Agency in the natural moral and intellectual World for his own Use or that of his FellowIntelligences For without all Doubt they must be some few of the most obvious of the Laws of infinite Wisdom laid down as the  Plan  by which all his  Works of Wonder  were at first form'd and are still govern'd And tho' in Him all this great Affair was but one single  Act  of Wisdom and Power yet in regard to us his  infinitesimal Miniatures  now in a lapsed State they must be consider'd by Parts in different Acts and divided  Sections  and view'd separately in Proportion to our weak and limited Faculties For certainly  general Laws  and universal Rules are the  Method  of Divine Agency and of his wise Providence  § THE general Laws of  Motion  the Laws of simple  Mechanism  the Laws of  Refraction  and  Reflection  and many more such general Laws both in natural  Philosophy  civil Society and human Policy are pretty well known and adjusted in all the polish'd Nations of the World and it is not improbable such general Laws may obtain in other  Systems  at least  analogically  and they actually do so as far as our Observation reaches And it is very probable that similar and  analogous  general Laws have place in the  moral    spiritual  and  intellectual  World For  God  is the same  Yesterday    Today    and for Ever  his Nature Attributes and Agency uniform And since he acts by  general Laws  in material Agency it is highly probable and conformable to his infinite Wisdom to act in the same uniform Manner in all his Operations  ad extra  and as far as just Observations have been made and wellgrounded Conclusions drawn by  Analogy  we shall find it so in all the  Systems    Moral    Spiritual  or  Divine  tho' these last have been but little studied and timorously applied to by Persons of a proper Spirit and Genius out of Dread of the odious Designation of  Enthusiasm  or Superstition but future Ages may perhaps get over this  Terror  for the Method has a solid Foundation in the Nature of Things  § THESE  general  Laws of the Divine  Oeconomy  in Creation and Providence or the Rules of consummate Wisdom and Fitness which the  Supreme Being  has chalk'd out and laid down are without all Doubt inexhaustible and incomprehensible to such an Order of Beings as we are in our present State and undiscoverable to any Degree of Perfection  for who can search out the Almighty to Perfection  Perhaps the Discovery of them may be a Part of the Happiness and Perfection of another State of Existence and some small Portion of the  Employment of happy  contemplative  Spirits in other Regions and there  The Works of the Lord will appear wonderful to them that delight therein  For if the First Being be rational intelligent wise and good as doubtless he is infinitely so there must of Necessity be in all his Works Conduct and Actions  ad extra  one perpetual  Analogy  and one continued  Harmony  through the Whole and in every single Part each individual  Organ  and  Law  must be fitted to this great End  viz  the Perfection of the Whole and of each Part and he who considers the  Oeconomy  of Nature  Providence  and  Restoration  with greatest Attention and Humility will most clearly discern this Wisdom Fitness and Divine Order in them  § SUPPOSE an infinitely wise powerful and good Being did intend to produce something new that he had no Pattern or Model of before Him as the first intelligent Cause could not possibly have in  Creation  as an Artificer for Example to descend the lowest in a Similitude he could only express in sensible Images the  Genius    Nature  and  Ideas  of his own Mind and fit the Parts and Organs of such a  Machine  to the End and Use for which it was designed with  Number    Weight  and  Measure  and so to compare great Things with small  Supreme Wisdom  having nothing but Himself his own beneficent Nature and Attributes  before Creation to copy forth and represent could in all his Works of Wonder delineate nothing but his own Substance Nature Wisdom Goodness Justice and Truth So that all Nature all Creation all the Worlds the  Material    Moral  and  Spiritual  can possibly be nothing else but the supreme immense and infinitely perfect Being  display'd    pourtray'd  and made  sensible  and perceptible  Mundus universus nihil aliud est    quam Deus explicitus  said a learned Man To think otherwise is a sort of  Blasphemy  and degrading of infinite Wisdom and Perfection below finite lapsed human Intelligences For there is no possible Work of any Man but which in some Degree is a Picture of himself of his own Idea or of the Constitution and Complexion of his Mind at that Time  § IF then there be a perpetual  Analogy  running through all the Works of God  Natural    Moral  and  Spiritual  if all his Workings  ad Extra  be Representations Pictures and  Hieroglyphicks  stronger or weaker more general or more particular of his own Nature Complexion and Attributes if the  material inanimated System  of outward Things being contrived with infinite Fitness Justness Propriety and Delicacy do represent his infinite Wisdom and Power in a more sensible yet in a darker and weaker Manner and if the  Oeconomy  of his universal  and particular Providence and the amazing  Oeconomy  of the  Restoration  of every individual lapsed Being be stronger and more irresistible Evidences and Representations of his infinite  Penetration  so to speak  Benevolence  and  Power  then it must be acknowledged that through all his Works there runs one perpetual  Progression  one continual  Analogy  and uninterrupted  Harmony  of his own Nature Wisdom and Power and that as  Proportion  is the  Medium  and true Logic of material Natures and Beings so  Analogy  is the true  Key  and  Analysis  of  spiritual  Natures and Qualities and as the  Data  of the  first  is in Sensation or the Notices from our Senses or accurate Experiment so the  Data  of the  last  is in Attention and Reflexion upon our own spiritual Natures and their Operations and Experience of the Qualities Sentiments and Passions of our own Hearts and Souls and carrying these to as great a Height as possible For I can conceive no clearer or more distinct Manner to give a Child or an ignorant Person an  Idea  tho' low and imperfect of the  first Being  than to tell him He is like the  Soul  or  living Nature  of the best and most amiable Person he ever knew infinitely exalted without his Imperfections but who has  Life  and  Being  from Himself only whereas all his Creatures are  Emanations  from Him and the Works of his Power And what is this but a true  Analogy  Just such a one as  when we give an Infant or ignorant Person an Idea of the  Sea  by shewing him the nearest great  Lake  and telling him that the Sea is of the same Nature but vastly bigger  § IT is plain from the natural civil and sacred History of the whole human Race from the visible and perceptible State of our  Globe  its surrounding  Atmosphere  kindred  Planets  and their Influences upon ours that  Pain    Suffering  and  Misery  is as natural and necessary to us here in this present State as  Existence  is It is utterly unavoidable but in  Degree  none ever lived but felt it it some Kind or Degree or other The Extreme Tenderness and Delicacy of our  lumbaginous  and  spermatic  State subject us to the Distempers and Sufferings arising from the Indiscretions and bodily Diseases of our Parents The Weakness and Helplessness of  Childhood  and Infancy expose us to innumerable Accidents and Distempers The imprudent and improper Nourishment in Quantity or Quality given us by our  Mothers  or  Nurses  bring naturally on us Suffering and Misery The Grossness Coarseness and Inclemency of the  Element  we live and breathe in  mechanically  infects us with its noxious and deleterious Qualities Ignorance bad Example contagious Custom and popular Errors and Prejudices continue the Hazards and Dangers of  Childhood  Strong Passions and Appetites a wrong  Turn of  Head  or  Heart  a corrupt and degenerate Age strengthen and confirm our Miseries and Misfortunes in  Youthhood  Disappointments Misfortunes Cares Want of or the bad Usage of the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life Luxury or Intemperance Famine or Scarcity  Epidemical  Diseases or unforeseen Accidents one or other or perhaps all together make the Complexion of  Manhood  And  old Age  the  Cardinal  Disease of human Life finishes the dark Scene of human Misery with perpetual Aches Sores and Infirmities of Body and Mind a more sensible Dotage and Childhood a  Taedium Vitae  with a Desire of Dissolution which is yet accompanied with a terrible Dread of it all these conclude this  Climax  and Progression of Misery through which the very best and wisest that lasts out the natural Duration of Life must pass for his  Punishment    Expiation  and  Purification  not to mention the Remorse and internal Crucifixion of those who feel a  Law in their Members warring against the Law of their Minds  in a perpetual Strife and Conflict It is only in and through the  Oeconomy  of the Restoration by the Knowledge of the  Gospel  that these natural necessary and unavoidable Pains Punishments and Miseries can be turned may be reckoned and are really  Mercies    Blessings    fatherly Corrections  lose their Stings and become  Righteousness    and Peace    and Joy in the Holy Ghost  § PAIN  Punishment  and  Suffering  then would seem to be a natural necessary and as it were a  mechanical  Mean of Expiation Purification and Perfection to all sentient and intelligent Beings in this present State of Existence which Virtue Attention and Care can only lessen but which none can totally but only in a small Degree avoid if not by and through the Means just now mentioned As rubbing hard Bodies against one another is the only Method to  polish  and  finish  them and the harder and longer the  Friction  the finer the Polish and the more perfect the Figure so Pain in sentient and intelligent Beings arises from  Resistance to Action  or from  Reaction  which in spiritual as well as material Agency is always equal and contrary to  Action  Sentient Beings naturally necessarily and as it were  mechanically  recede from and exert a Principle of  Resistance  and  Reaction  to the Cause of Pain intelligent Beings  caeteris paribus  necessarily fly from it with greater Velocity from the united Force of  Sensation  and  Reflection  Sensation and Perception begin the Aversion and Reluctance to the Cause or Occasion of Pain and Reflection turns it into an Abhorrence and Detestation  § CONSCIOUSNESS of the Reasons and Effects seems in no wise absolutely necessary towards  Purification  in general at least towards  the first Degrees of it as we see in  Brutes    Children  and  Ideots  Pain and Punishment in such a Degree and often repeated will naturally bring them to abstain from that for which they suffer  Consciousness  of the End and Design of it seems only necessary to accelerate perfect and turn into a  Habit  the Aversion and Abhorrence of what has caused Pain and to strengthen that Habit into a second Nature as Wood is made streight first by softening it by Fire and then keeping it by Cords and Weights in a Situation contrary to its  Curvature  Pain and Punishment soften and melt down the Subject  Consciousness  fixes and hardens it and gives it an habitual contrary Nature  Consciousness  attends single  Acts  only and not  Habits  when the Habit is perfected Consciousness vanishes and dies away as a perfect Musician while playing on an Instrument reflects not on single Strokes distinctly so that  Consciousness  seems necessary as a  Check  or  Bar  to prevent Relapses and seldom takes place till the End and Design of Punishment is in some Degree obtained  § FROM what has been said it is evident that this our  Planet  and its Appendages is really and literally a Prison or Gaol a Place of Banishment of Pains and Punishment for a certain Period of Time to lapsed sentient and intelligent Beings like  Siberia  among the  Ruffians  the  Bastille  or the  Pierre incise  with the  French  or the  Plantations  or  Newgate  among us And the Inhabitants of both Kinds sentient and intelligent are without a Figure Prisoners Slaves and Felons under a State of Expiation and Purification Our whole  Creation  our intire  System  in regard to our defaced and spoilt  Planet  labours like Slaves at the Oar is in  Travail  in a perpetual  Fermentation  and  Effervescence  as in a malignant Fever working for a  Crise  and Delivery Some Individuals may be delivered sooner some later according as their Expiation and Purification is perfected and at last the whole  System  and all its Inhabitants must naturally and necessarily but  harmoniously  or  analogically  and according to general Laws undergo some great and violent  Crise  and an universal  GaolDelivery  will be brought about but when and how this will be accomplished is beyond Conjecture  a Thousand Years are but as a Day here  and the Ways of the  Almighty  are past finding out It would seem as if the only  Problem  or Difficulty to speak so in regard to Omnipotence where no real Difficulty can happen worthy of infinite Wisdom to  solve  were to recover perfect and establish in perpetual and unrelapsing  Order  and  Purity  free and lapsed intelligent Beings consistent with the  Harmony  of his own Attributes and the  natural Powers  with which he has endued them How infinite Wisdom and Power will  bring this about we can only conjecture in a few general  Hints  from such of his  general Laws  as are obvious from  final Causes  which are plain and must include some Part of the Ends in rational Agency and from dark Sketches of the  Analogy  of Things not impossibly thus  § AN infinitely wise good and powerful Being having created this  System  we cannot suppose but it must have been as perfect and blissful as its Nature could admit and his sentient intelligent Creatures as happy as their Natures and Order could allow and that he must have furnished them with Means and Power to perpetuate if not increase this Perfection and Happiness But from the very Nature and Essence of  Liberty  whoever has a Power to continue or increase in a State must also have a Power to fall back or decrease whatever is  finite  must necessarily be  fallible  Now suppose such finite fallible Beings actually lapsed the same wise and good Being must have ordered Things so not only that they should recover and rise again but that their Fall and  Lapse  should at last be a Mean not only to strengthen confirm and fix them in Happiness ever after and this seems the only Mean by which fallible free lapsed Creatures once actually fallen could be brought to an illapsing State of Stability but even to increase the Degree of their Happiness and Perfection and this I think would not only be the full and plenary  Solution of this infinitely difficult  Problem  but one worthy of its allwise and allpowerful Author only and this he has effected I think by these three Expedients or Means By continuing  general Laws  of Agency in material moral and spiritual Actions plainly intimating that the Concurrence of the same Causes and Conditions will always produce the same Effects and so leaving Room for Consideration Amendment Improvment Choice and the Discernment of moral Good and Evil and thus securing  Liberty  and the other natural Powers of lapsed Intelligences By tying down sopiting and suspending the  natural Powers  of the Soul for so long a Time as is its Duration from the first original  Male  till the Bonds and Chains by which their Exertion is restrained be broken and untyed by Death That during this Time the Benefit acquired by the progressive Parentage if  they  happen to return to Order and Habits of Virtue or have their moral Powers recovered may operate on these  infinitesimal Miniatures  by mending their Natures that they themselves may have time given to recover into Order and that the Interruption from the  natural Powers  arrived at their Perfection might not prevent the Acquisition and Recovery of the  Moral Powers  And By the  Oeconomy  of  Redemption  by a  Saviour  which doubtless was projected before the Creation of the World or this System and when the proper  Disposition to receive it and to reap the Benefit of it is acquired and which may in some Time or Place  explicitly  or  implicitly  be revealed to finish the Work of Restoration But that not being my Province in a  Philosophical Disquisition  I proceed  § IT is the grossest Absurdity and Contradiction to suppose that an infinitely wise and beneficent Being would make either  sentient  or  intelligent  Beings suffer merely for Suffering's Sake He must have had just good and kind Reasons for this his  strange Work  And since it is certain that both  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings do and must unavoidably  suffer  and are in a State of Punishment Misery and Banishment here it necessarily follows that they are in a State of Expiation Purification and progressive Perfection in their respective Orders and will at last be set free made happy and perfected and confirmed in that State for ever  Omnipotence  surely can and  infinite Goodness  I hope will do all this  § IF all is not Deceit and Illusion it must be evident to a  Demonstration  that nothing imperfect or unhappy in its Order can come out of the Hands of infinite Perfection and yet it is Fact that all  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings here are universally more or less miserable and imperfect and that there never  was any human Creature in his right Senses which in a whole Duration of human Life felt not and thought not himself unhappy miserable and imperfect at least for some time if not for the most of his rational Life and wish'd not himself earnestly better wiser more perfect and happy It is impossible that infinite Wisdom and Goodness can punish  sentient  and  intelligent  Creatures or make them miserable but for some wise and beneficent End and Purpose from whence it will be evident to a rational Person that of necessity there must have been a  State of Existence prior  to this present wherein all those  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings while in a  collective Mass  which have been or shall be on this  Globe  had misbehaved rebell'd and run into Disorder probably by idolatrising Creatures and  Self  and preferring them to the  Creator  And the Account of this Rebellion and Lapse in  Revelation  may refer only to the last  Scene  or Act in the Tragedy or the new modelling this  secondary State  or partially  lapsed System  when the slightest Trial of Faith and Obedience was made for certainly  Nemo repentè fit turpissimus  finite Creatures can naturally acquire Habits of Virtue and Vice or indeed of any kind only by  Degrees  or single Acts repeated Certain  Consciousness  or clear distinct Knowledge of this  preexistent State  would only feed idle Curiosity and might hinder and counteract that implicit  Trust Dependence and absolute Resignation in every Thing so absolutely necessary to relative Perfection and Happiness For the Point in View of infinite Perfection is to bring all the finite sentient and intelligent Creatures to an absolute  voluntary Surrendry  and  Trust  of themselves and every Thing relating to them in Time and Eternity to his Will and Pleasure  implicitly  nothing less being sufficient to establish and perpetuate the Divine Sovereignty  harmonise  his Attributes and  eternise  the Peace Happiness and relative Perfection of universal Nature which different  Willing  would eternally confound and perplex anew and bring on a  second  or perpetuate the present  Lapse  § IT is not impossible that there are other  States    Mansions  and  probatory Celestial Regions  proper and peculiar to the several imperfect Degrees of the moral Faculties of spiritual Intelligences with their  CreationBodies  or Vehicles according to the several remaining  Degrees  of Imperfection even almost  in infinitum  in an ascending or descending  Progression  Infinite Wisdom and Goodness may have appointed in general a certain limited Period beyond which the Incrustation of their  CreationBodies  cannot last things being in such a State But the actual Approach may be quicker or slower according to certain Terms and Conditions which we know to be the Case of our present  mortal Tabernacles    and according to the bad or good Usage of our Liberties in the Use of the Means afforded us for acquiring the  moral Virtues  and affixing the  moral Powers  in confirm'd Habits we may ascend into more pure more happy and more perfect  Regions  or descend into more gross miserable and dark  Dungeons  almost  in infinitum  But it would also seem that  sentient  and  intelligent  Creatures could suffer Pain and Misery only to a certain finite and limited Degree tho' the Time may be eternal all Spirits being immortal by Nature all the  Activities  and  Passivities  of such Beings being necessarily  finite  and limited and when they come to that  Point  they must necessarily return wish for Deliverance cry for Mercy Pity and Freedom and endeavour it with the whole natural Powers of their Spirits and to this  Point  only it would seem an infinitely  wise    beneficent  and  powerful  Being can intend to bring his lapsed wandering  miniature  Creatures now under the  Gospel  and that he should be ready to receive them into Mercy and allow them the Means for restoring and recovering their lapsed  moral Powers  But how long Time it may require to bring them to this absolutely necessary Point no Reason or  Philosophy  whether an  Indefinite  that is a  creaturely  or  relatively infinite  Time can determine and  Revelation  has not made it plain and explicit but on the contrary has left it not only dubious but seems to point otherwise to be sure not before all are brought  to this indispensable Point of  Returning  The  Oeconomy    Satisfaction  and  Sufferings  of the  GodMan Jesus Christ  could be only sufficient to render that Expiation and Restoration of the moral Power in a finite Time which in its own Nature and the Nature of  God  and of his Purity must have been Infinite and Eternal The repairing the  Indignity  and  Affront  done to his Sovereignty and Purity and the deterring his other standing Creatures from  Lapse  and  Rebellion  is not perhaps left in their Power to prevent that may be done by the necessary and unavoidable Pains and Sufferings they must undergo from the painful and leprous  Incrustation  of the several  Elements  they must pass through their  returning  into Order their Acquisition of the  moral Powers  of the Soul and fixing them in these and consequently in permanent Happiness intirely depends on themselves and the Use of the Means afforded  § IT is no easy Matter to form any precise limited Idea or Notion of  Substance  either  Material  or  Spiritual  all we certainly know of either is that they  exist  are Realities and are the  Base  or Subject of real Qualities But we can no more penetrat into the  Substratum  or Support of these Qualities by the natural Activity of our Spirits than our Eyes can see Objects at a certain Distance such is the Nature Frame and Limitation of our Order and Rank of  natural Powers  We certainly know that  material Substance  is the  Substratum  of  Extension    Impenetrability    Passivity  and  Figure  and spiritual Substance of  living    perceiving  and  willing  that is of  Cogitation  or  Thinking  and also of  beginning  Motion in Bodies and giving them a particular  Direction  The Aggregate or Sum of all these respective Qualities most of which are contrary to the others may be bound together or united by some  Bond of Union  which we shall never have any direct or immediate Conception of till we throw off this material  Incrustation  that intangles and fetters the full Exercise and Penetration of our natural Powers And therefore if we dropt both Substances as  unknown  and  unknowable  Things at present or rather if we suppos'd both only mere  Capacities    Recipients    Canals  or passive Subjects of contrary Qualities as they flow or are deriv'd from the primary Source and selfexistent Cause of all  Activity    Qualities  and  Realities  whose whole End and Use of these  Capacities  was to receive and contain these Qualities limiting contrary and destructive of each other respectively or lastly if as  Geometers  use the Method we make the one  Positive  the other  Negative  this way of considering this dark Subject might perhaps throw some Light on it And then imagin'd that  Matter  or  Body  was  analogous  to but yet nowise the same with but quite contrary tho' not contradictory to  Spirit  infinitely condens'd  concentred or incrassated And that  spiritual  Substance was  analogous  to  Matter  infinitely rarefied refin'd or  sublim'd  Then in the  Geometrical  Manner of considering such respective Qualities and their Subject  Body  infinitely rarefied refin'd and sublim'd would at last terminat in limited  Space  or  Expansion  and limited  Space  or  Expansion  infinitely condens'd contracted and inspissated would end in solid indivisible Points or  Monads  the common Idea of the component Particles of Body And yet that Body should be rarefied into  Space  or  Space  condens'd into Body is an absolute Contradiction and Impossibility only this Manner in which Geometers consider infinitely  little  or infinitely  great  Quantities is here suggested as an Illustration of material and spiritual Substance so difficult to be explain'd But we not being able to conceive or comprehend  Infinitude  or infinite Agency its Effects and Consequences it may perhaps be said that this is only explaining one  Obscurity  by a  greater  It may be so All then we are absolutely certain of is that these essential Qualities of  Matter  and  Spirit  respectively  viz  in  Matter    Extension    Impenetrability    Divisibility    Mobility    Passivity  and  Figure  and in Spirit  Living    Perceiving    Willing    Selfactivity    Selfmobility  and the Power of  beginning  Motion and giving  Direction  to Bodies must necessarily be uniform and always the same in Degree  whatever State or Circumstances they may be in These respective Substances are always in their own Nature and Essence so  contrary  and destructive of one another in their Qualities that they become a perpetual Bar Obstruction and Obstacle to the Exertion of these their essential Qualities They are not indeed  contradictory  or destructive of one another's Qualities in every Degree they are not  incompatible  and  unallyable  as we know by Fact but they are  contrary  and one Degree of the Qualities of the one destroys a relative equal or proportional Degree of the Qualities of the other and the  Sum total  of these Qualities in the one destroys the  Sum total  of the Qualities of the other equally or proportionally like  Light  and  Darkness  and an infinite Degree of the one may sopite or totally obstruct the  sensible Actions  of the other tho' not annihilat or absolutely destroy the other in its Root or Nature But  Infinitude  being above our Capacities we can only speak of the Effects of their Contrariety and Opposition in their finite Degrees and pronounce nothing of the Effects of  infinite  Operations only we are certain that no less than an infinite Power and Operation in the one can totally extinguish and annihilat the Nature and Operations of the other  Reaction  being always contrary and equal to  Action  We may have a fine  Illustration  and  analogous  Resemblance of this infinite contrarv Action from the Nature  of an infinite  converging Series  in which from the next immediate Step in the Progression by passing through  infinitely little  of that Order the Terms from  positive  become  negative  and likewise from some  Particles  of Matter which after having got without their  Sphere  from  attractive  become  repulsive  in respect to a particular  Centre  these Hints are far from an affirming or any Endeavour to prove that  Matter  is only infinitely  condens'd Spirit  and  Spirit  only infinitely  refin'd Matter  as to their several Substances For the  Fact  I think false impossible and contradictory for  Matter  however refin'd and sublim'd is still  Matter  and has the opposite Qualities to  Spirit  and have their essential Qualities in direct Contrariety and were it otherwise in this Manner of illustrating the Subject the Proof were absolutely impossible because the Effects of  infinite Power  and  Agency  are known and knowable by Him only whose Attributes are infinite Power and Might If the  Proposition  and Effect was true and real no  finite  Agency could effect it nor  finite  Understanding evince it But these Instances are adduc'd only as an  Illustration  to remove the seeming  shocking  Absurdity and Terror in most good Persons Minds from affirming any Resemblance or  Analogy  between  material  and  spiritual  Substances for these evidently shew that  similar  and  analogous  Effects are Realities in the Nature of Things  tho' their Manner and Process be inconceiveable to us finite Beings and also as much as in me lies to take off any Mistakes and Misapprehension as if I advanc'd any thing in the  Philosophic  Explication of these  Mysteries  of Nature inconsistent with  Revelation  or  Religion  as the Reverend Dr  Brown  Bishop of  Cork  has done in his  Divine Analogy  not fully having understood my Manner of explaining the Subject or perhaps I had not made my Meaning sufficiently clear and plain as the Subject is in itself almost inexplicable and ought to be guarded with all possible Precision if at all handled  § IN my poor Way of conceiving and conjecturing from the obvious  Appearances  in Nature subjected to Sense from the  final Causes  the Supreme Rational Being may possibly have in such  external Operations  from the  Analogy  carried from the Things that are seen to those that are invisible and only intelligible the most probable and satisfactory Account that can be found of the  Oeconomy  and Plan of the Restoration of finite lapsed Intelligences seems to be this at least these may possibly be some of the  prominent Lines  of this  Plan  Some finite free Intelligences of the several  Orders  in the living  Hierarchies  having by the Abuse of their  Liberty  and committing  Idolatry  by too inordinate Commerce with the Creatures and habitually turning  away from their Source the  Creator  destroyed and cancell'd the  moral Powers  of their  spiritual  Natures  Infinite Wisdom  and  Power  by the Necessity of his  beneficent  Nature employing the whole Force of his  Omnipotence  and  Omniscience  to restore and recover them without committing  Violence  on their  natural Powers  or on the  Harmony  of his own  Attributes  first ties down and contracts their  natural Powers  with Chains of gross Matter from a purposely or mechanically ruin'd and defac'd  Elementary Globe  such as our present Habitation is Chains which the  natural Powers  of the  Spirit  are necessarily obliged to endeavour to be unloosing all the Time from the  original Creation  of this gross Body during which Time Means Opportunity and Leisure is allow'd for the  Acquisition  and  Restoration  of the  moral Powers  As Felons and Robbers are tam'd and mended by working in the Mines and tugging at the Oar By the Toil Labour and Suffering from this working off and melting down the gross and leprous  Plaister  superinduc'd on the primitive  Creation  Body by fileing purifying and breaking these Chains which fetter the Activity and free Agency of the  natural Powers  of the Soul on this  CreationBody First  Reparation and an  Amende honorable  is made to infinite Purity and Sovereignty and the bad Example to other  Intelligences  remov'd And in the mean time outward and inward Means  may be offer'd and bestow'd by external Providences  suprahumane  and  imperceptible  Aid and  Grace  and the Light and internal Operation of the  Divine Word  and  Reason  the  Messiah  for recovering the defac'd  moral Powers  of the Soul Some are under this Operation a shorter some a longer Time according to the Wisdom and Designs of the Sovereign  Reason  and the Mansion they are to fill in the new  Jerusalem  even till the last  Scene  which in the Nature of gross corruptible Matter can last but a  finite Time  either in the Nature of the  Elementary Planet  itself with its  Appendages  or in the Incrustation on the primitive  Creation  Bodies made of this elementary Matter which must crumble and dissolve into Dust within certain Limits of Time by the establish'd Law of Nature the  first  possibly from the Expence and Fixation of  Water  as Sir  Isaac Newton  insinuates and the  other  necessary Fluids the  others  for want of  Nutrition  and  Chylification  and both by Natural and general Laws but still within certain Limits less than real  infinite  But both must at last be perfectly purified the  Earth  and its  Appendages  possibly by an universal  Conflagration  the particular gross Plaistering by being dissolv'd into its  original Dust  that the primitive  Creation  Body may be disincumber'd and made supple and pliable to obey the Dictates of the informing immaterial  Spirit  and the  Spirit  by the Acquisition and habitual fixing of the Moral Powers For there cannot be a more  certain and indubitable Truth than that nothing  imperfect  in its Order could come out of the Hands of infinite Perfection and that nothing  impure  or imperfect in its Order can return to live and commerciate with or be united to God perfectly finally and immutably  § This  Infinitesimal  Particle of Celestial Matter this  Miniature  of a  Miniature in infinitum  decreasing in a continued  analogical  Progress and stor'd up in the Seeds of all Animals and Vegetables from the first to the last Animal and Vegetable this divinely organis'd Vehicle or  Corpuscle  in which the immaterial Principle was inspir'd in its Creation and to which it is so intimately united by a particular Law of Union and an individual  Fitness  and  Congruity  is inseparable from it in all its future States and Circumstances of Duration at least by any Degree of  Force  less than  infinite  The  immaterial Spirit  the Spiritual Inhabitant of this  Celestial Vehicle  is in its own Nature immortal and imperishable being an  infinitesimal Miniature  of the Divine Nature and Substance which is  Selfexistent  I say then the  Spirit  the immaterial Substance that informs this  aethereal Creation  Body is of its own Nature  immortal  and  imperishable  but the  material Vehicle  tho' of a refin'd and  aethereal  Substance is only eternal by the Divine Order and Appointment and  comparatively  in respect of other grosser and more dense Compounds of which Time and Use may alter the Form tho' not  destroy the Substance and perhaps their Perpetuity may be continued by a divine primary or secondary spiritual Influence from both these immortal Principles I am sensible these strong Figures may be expos'd to  Ridicule  and interpreted  profanely  by light Persons but when they understand and can explain with  Precision  what the Force of  Infinitude  small or great is their Raillery and Levity may be tolerable such of Necessity must be the Language when we attempt to express perceptible only and  spiritual  Things I hope I have a due Sense of the Purity and Perfection of the Divine Nature and Spiritual Things not to expose them maliciously and designedly to Contempt and Ridicule My whole Design is to help honest and sincere Persons to some  Ideal  Knowledge which at best is but a poor Affair that may possibly comfort and mend the  Heart  without hurting the  Head  § IF there is any  Verisimilitude  or Consistency in this  Sketch  it will follow from it that the lighter and thinner while sweet and healthy the  Crust  and  Plaister  from this  elementary System  that is laid over this  Creation  Body the more the natural Powers of the Spirit will be at Liberty to exert their Functions and acquire the moral ones the Sufferings and Miseries of the present State of our Existence will be fewer and less intense and  the total Disengagement of the  Spiritual  Inhabitant from its Prison and Load will be more easy and perfect and we shall shake off our  Chains  and Fetters as we do our Cloaths to go to Bed The universal Law of Nature for every  sentient  and  intelligent  Being that is brought on this  elementary Planet  is  first  to have its spiritual and its celestial Body tied down and concentred by Chains and Fetters of this Element into a  Miniature  of a  Miniature  then into a  Punctum Saliens  and at last into a sensible elementary Body During all this Time the spiritual Nature is working like a Slave in the Mines or at the Oar to extend this celestial Body to its original  analogous  Figure and Dimensions by breaking all its elementary Fetters while yet at the same time it is crusting over more densely the primitive  celestial  Body by Nutrition and the animal Functions with a gross  leprous  Plaister when the Creation Body is intirely develop'd by giving a Facility to its Organs of all kinds by  Culture  and  Use  in their several Ways its intellectual Faculties get Power and Liberty to exert themselves during which Time the Acquisition of the moral Powers may and ought to take Place and by Degrees and in a nearly determinable Period this Plaister dries hardens and at last crumbles into Dust and then the Spirit with the celestial Body if but partially purified passes into other  States    Elements  and  Mansions  as its Degree of moral  Virtue or Acquisition of moral Powers require  § FROM this Representation of the State and Progress of  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings in Spirit and Body during their Banishment to this  ruinous Planet  it follows that the  Root    Faculty  and  Capacity  of the Spirit or its natural Powers continue  potentially  and  radically  the same or that  living    perceiving  and  willing  as to their Essence Power and Capacity are in all States radically and invariably the same tho' their Exercise Acts and Exertion be restrain'd and sopited by gross Matter Whoever considers the invariable Nature of spirit must be convinc'd that its giving Motions with their several Modifications must always radically and potentially be the same and uniform however their Acts may be suspended sopited or destroyed by gross Matter and the Immechanism of Bodies and that all the  Functions  of the Body all its voluntary and  involuntary  Motions all its  living  and  vital  Actions all its internal and external Operations all its  Sensations    Passions  and  Willings  that depend on the Body are all but  Cogitation  or  Thinking  in some Degree or other and its several  Modifications  as really as  intense  fullgrown Thinking with Reflexion or Meditation is in a Word that the  Soul    Spirit  or living Principle is really the true and only intelligent Being and the Body only is its Organ Instrument  or Tool and but a passive Adjunct of the living Intelligence and consequently that our acquir'd  Knowledge  is but  Remembrance  that a  moral Sense  and  Faculty  that  innate Ideas  of  God  and  Virtue  of  moral Good  and  Evil  That  spiritual Sensation  and  spiritual Senses  and that the  Soul  uses material Organs tho' not of gross Matter only in all its Operations all these are as much  Philosophical Realities  however ridiculed and exposed by ignorant Persons as the same Things are when sensibly and outwardly transacted on our finish'd and perfect external Senses and that All our  Culture    Study  and  Labour  to acquire Sciences and Knowledge or to perfect our natural Powers terminat only in  fileing  off  melting  away and  scraping  down those Chains and Crust superinduced upon them and are only removing  Superfluities  reducing  Excrescences  and rendering the gross  Patchwork  superinduced on our spiritual Body pliant supple and correspondent with the least Resistance to it that the  Creation  Body may be at Liberty to extend and disincumber itself And  Lastly  That the shortest and readiest Way to true and solid  Knowledge  is to endeavour with the utmost Vigour and strongest Effects of our  spiritual  Nature to recover and acquire the moral Powers of the Soul defac'd and cancelled by the  Lapse  viz  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  or in the  Revelation  Language  Faith    Hope    and  Charity  to which these will be found when justly explained intirely  analogous  and consonant for it could only be to allow Time and Uninterruption from the  natural  Powers had they been always in their full Extent and Force that they have been thus ty'd down and sopited so that now they can only rise and extend in Proportion as the  moral Powers  are acquired  § THE  Activity    Sensibility  and  Penetration  the voluntary and involuntary  Motions  of this our Elementary Body the animal  Functions  the more material Acts of  Thinking  and  Cogitation  such as  Sensation    Memory    Imagination    Attention  c are all radically and primarily perform'd by the  Selfaction  and  Selfmotion  of the immaterial  Spirit  on this  Creationaethereal Body  principally as  Sulphureous Inflammations  raise Mountains and as  Springs  and  Weights  move  Clockworks  with this notable Difference that the first has an internal immortal Spring of  Selfaction  the other only a temporary and transitory one Perhaps for  Example  towards  voluntary  and  involuntary Motion  or towards the Exertion of the  animal Functions  I say perhaps there may not be wanted any  foreign    independent  and  perplex'd subtile Fluid  of whatever Nature if the animal Appearances and Functions can be more simply as clearly and fully explained by the Action of a  selfactive  and  selfmotive  spiritual  Substance informing and influencing a fitly and  divinely organized aethereal Body  and thereby immediately impressing its Action and Energy on the gross earthly Plaister laid over it A true  spiritual Substance  of the very lowest Order must necessarily have in itself a  Spring  of Selfaction a  Principle  and Faculty of Selfmotion from its own  internal  Nature and Essence I can have no Notion of a  spiritual  Substance that has not a Power of beginning and impressing Motion on Matter or Body fitly disposed there seems no Distinction so essential between  Spirit  and  Body  as  Activity  and  Passivity  'tis true this Activity in created spiritual Substances is finite and limited and may be further restrained by  gross Matter  to any Degree but it will be always sufficient to begin and impress Motion on Body so long as the  Inertia  of Body is not greater than the  Selfactivity  of such an  Order  of spiritual Substances else it could not in any Sense be called  selfactive  And to produce  muscular Motion  and the  animal Functions  and Appearances there may be nothing more necessary than  Selfactivity  and  Selfmobility  in a greater or lesser Degree and divine Organisation Fitness and not insuperable Resistance or rather a ready  Facility  in the primitive  aethereal  Vehicle which may overcome the Load of Plaister and Rust laid over it I say perhaps this may be sufficient to account fully for all the animal Appearances a foreign  subtile  Fluid  may be necessary to explain the Appearances of  inanimated  Matter but seems here  superfluous  and looks perplex'd and operose and unlike the Operations of the  God of Nature  which are always from easy and simple  Causes  and by one such Cause produce various and beautiful Effects And I think there is scarce accounting for the infinitely different Degrees of Sensibility the Degrees of Stature and Growth and the Degrees of Penetration and of quick and slow Thinking Memory and Solidity both in sentient and intelligent Animals without allowing the Plaistering and Soder on the  Creation  aethereal Body to sit lighter thinner and less incumbring on some than on others and the aethereal Organs to be more at Liberty in the vastly sensible and quick Thinkers and Feelers than in the slow  § IT would seem in this progressive State of Purification of lapsed  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings that when one  Crust  or  Plaister  from the Element to which they are confined is worn off another may grow on of the Nature of the  Celestial  or  Terrestrial Mansion  which they inhabit fitted to the Degree of the acquired  moral Powers  and this in a continual  Ascent  or  Descent  till the moral Powers are perfected and confirmed into  Habits  and the aethereal or spiritual Body is purified and refined from all the  Dross  and  Rust  it had contracted and then will be  accomplished their last permanent and eternal State suited to their  Order  § THE specific Law of  Attraction    Fitness  and Similarity of the  Element  or  Planet  to the Degree of the moral Purity or Impurity in  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings may as naturally and necessarily determin and  attract  them to this their specific  Region  or  Mansion  as the Eggs of Insects and Seeds of Plants scattered and blown by the Wind are directed drawn and adhere by  Electricity  to the Leaves of those  Plants  and  Trees  only which are fittest and have the most proper Juices for their  Adhesion    Incubation  and  Vivification  and for crusting them over to defend their Delicacy and Sensibility while young and tender from such Injuries as would put an End to Life For a Law of  Attraction    Fitness  and  Similarity  will be found to hold good either simply or in some kind of Proportion or  analogically  through all Creation as well in  Spirits  as in  Bodies  in the  natural    moral  and  celestial  Worlds till the first and supreme Being become locally and finally  All in all  and that All be in him with Perfection and  analogous  Similarity in their several Natures as the  Fish  or  Rivers  are in the Sea and that he acts and influences and gives Perfection and Happiness to all Things He has made  CONCLUSION  THIS  rude  and unfinished  Sketch  may possibly be thought by some an  imaginary  and  enthusiastical Romance  and so perhaps it may be It is innocent if a  Fable  and if thought otherwise by proper and competent Judges I should renouce and disclaim it But on the most intense anxious and mature  Observations  and  Reflexions  on universal Nature on allowing the Supreme Being to be a  wise    good    powerful  and  rational  Agent admitting  final Causes  when they are obvious and  Analogy  when plain and simple the  Outlines  and  Groundwork  of this System may be just and solid however faulty the  Detail  and  Execution  may be I can be answerable for nothing but the Honesty of my Intention in it  END of the FIRST DISCOURSE  DISCOURSE II Philisophical CONJECTURES ABOUT THE Preference of VEGETABLE TO ANIMAL FOOD AND OF THE End and Design of PROVIDENCE IN Appointing the FIRST AND ON TRIAL Permitting the LATTER  Gen i  And God said Behold I have given you every Herb bearing Seed which is upon the Face of all the Earth and every Tree in which is the Fruit of the Tree yielding Seed to you it shall be given for Meat  Gen ix  Every living thing that moveth shall be Meat for you even as the green Herb have I given you all things  Ver  But Flesh with the Life thereof which is the Blood thereof you shall not eat  DISCOURSE II  Philosophical CONJECTURES ABOUT THE Preference of VEGETABLE TO ANIMAL FOOD AND OF THE End and Design of PROVIDENCE in Appointing the  First  and on Trial Permitting the  Latter  § IT is certain that by our Make by the Frame of our  Organs  we are now fitted as for Vegetable so for Animal Food The Form of  some  of our Teeth the  Liver  the  Pancreas  and many other of our internal Bowels and  conglomerate Glands  seem primarily and chiefly designed and fitted to  antidote  the Mischiefs arising from  animal Food  and  fermented Liquors  at least for some Time and in the Days of our Youth  and Vigour For certainly a Part of the  Designs  of any intelligent Agent may be known by  Analogy  justly drawn and by  final Causes  and is the best Evidence finite and lapsed Creatures seem capable of receiving in the Designs and Contrivances of the  Creator  till they come to converse with him  Face to Face  They may be mistaken in them as well as in every other kind of  Evidence  being finite lapsed and consequently  fallible  Creatures But this seems to be the only  Evidence  they are capable of at present in such Matters and may shew evidently the Design of the  Author of Nature  as a  convex Screw  of any Number of Spires shews that it was design'd to fit some concave one of the same Number of  Spires  and  Diameter Chance  is only a  technical  Word to denote our Ignorance of the true and  physical  Cause of Order and Design and yet admitting the Existence of  Chance  that through the whole human Race there should have been in the infinite Number of their Organs a perfect Similarity by  Chance  only and not Design may by a fair  Calculation  be shewn to be as  infinite  to  finite  that is mathematically impossible But the  Question  I design to treat of here is Whether  Animal  or  Vegetable  Food was in the original Design of the  Creator  intended for the Food of Animals and particularly of the  human Race  And I am almost convinced it  never was  intended  but only  permitted  as a  Curse  or Punishment and a  Cure  for a  Malady  or as the  French  term it a  pisalle  and because infinite Wisdom and Power could make no more of his corrupted rebellious free Creatures in their present State and for this infinitely wise and paternal End He seems to have permitted it To let them  feel  and experience the natural and necessary Effects of their own Lusts and Concupiscence by painful and cruel Distempers  Feeling  and Experience being the surest Means by which a finite lapsed Creature can know and learn To shorten the Duration of their natural Lives that  Sin    Misery  and  Rebellion  might not increase infinitely To produce naturally and in a Manner consistent with  Liberty  and the other natural Powers of the Soul which being deriv'd from Him and being his  Miniature  Images He neither could nor would force or destroy those Sufferings and Miseries and Dislike of  inordinate Lusts  and Enjoyments that might make them think ponder and return to  Order    Love of Virtue  and its  source  and  Original  And To sink and contract the  natural Powers  of the Soul viz  Living    Understanding  and  Will  by means of such frail Bodies into a  Level  with the decayed and lapsed  moral Ones    viz Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  which by this Rebellion were greatly corrupted and degraded  The Reasons that incline me to think in this Manner are these following  § WHATEVER be the true  primogenial  and last Principle of Bodies beyond which it is impossible to  analyse  or divide them these are incontestably found in all  animal  and  vegetable  Bodies as has been before observ'd  Sulphur  Oil or material Heat from whence Spirit and Activity  Salt  or hard angular Particles highly attractive and dissolvable in Water  Air  or small elastic Particles  Water  or  Phlegm  from whence alone Fluidity And lastly  Earth  the Base and  Substratum  of these others In the due and proportional Union of these do the Variety and Difference of animal Substances consist Now it is past all Doubt in Philosophy and in philosophical  Chemy  that  animal Substances  of most kinds possess in a much greater Proportion the  two first  of these Principles  viz Salts  and  Oils  than  Vegetables  which partake more of the last  viz Air    Water  and  Earth  But from many undeniable Experiments the two first Principles are known to be the most active  energic  and  deleterious  and tend more by their Activity to the Division Dissolution and Destruction of the Subject than those others when they enter in any great Proportion The  Jelly  the Juice or Chyle of  animal  Substances is  infinitely more tenacious and glewy  Vide  Memoirs of the Academy Royal for and  and its last Particles more closely united and separated with greater Difficulty than those of  vegetable  Substances This is evident from the Experiments made with them in joining of Wood and is known to all  Artificers  and may be made manifest to the Senses in the Difference between the Tenacity of  Campjelly  or  Fishglew  and that of Paste made of Flower or Barley or from the Strength of  Ropes  or  Cords  made of  Catgut  or  Leather  and those made of  Tow  or  Hemp  of the same  Diameter  And therefore  animal Food  must much sooner more strongly and irremediably make Viscidities in  animal  Fluids and more  schirrously  obstruct the  Capillaries  and  Glands  than vegetable Substances But the far more pernicious and destructive Part is the  Salts  and  Oil  abounding more in most  animal  than in  vegetable  Substances of which there are so many and convincing Demonstrations that none can have any Doubt of it that has the least Acquaintance with natural  Philosophy  For our Blood and Juices being nourish'd and supply'd by such  Substances  as abound most with these active  elementary  Principles must necessarily be stored and saturated with  Salts  and  Sulphurs  and these being always in a  State of  Action  are the true original and the most adequate Causes of the most excruciating Distempers When to these  strong    fermented  and  spirituous  Liquors are added as a Vehicle or diluting Mixture and join to the  Salts  and  Sulphurs  of animal Substances not only their  inflammable  Spirits and  tartarous  Salts but their condensing and hardening Quality on the Food in the Stomach the Digestion is by that means hindered and stopped and the Food not being sufficiently divided and comminuted but broken only into gross Particles does more quickly and obstinately thicken the Juices and obstruct the  Glands  and  Capillaries  than  vegetable  Substances Animal Juices and Substances before they were turned into Flesh must have been strain'd through infinitely smaller and more numerous  Tubes  such as the last and extreme  Capillaries  are some of which are not bigger than the  six hundredth part  of an Hair by which Means their Particles must be render'd extremely smaller and finer and consequently have a much greater Degree of  Attraction  than those of Vegetables which pass through fewer  Strainers  and have no other motive Powers but the  Heat  of the  Sun  whereas those of animal Substances have besides the  Sun  the Force of  muscular  Digestion and of the Motion of the Heart the Flesh of Animals I say must upon this Account necessarily consist of smaller  Particles and so be united with a greater Force and endow'd with a greater Degree of  Attraction  and consequently must with far greater Difficulty be digested and separated than  vegetable  Substances possibly can And hence it is that  carnivorous  Animals are much more  deleterious  Food being endow'd with much finer and more pungent  Salts  and  Sulphurs  than those Animals that live on  Vegetables  only as both the higher  Savour  and deleterious Effects of the first abundantly shew From all which it is plain to a Demonstration that animal Substances must naturally and necessarily  incrassate  the Juices and produce  Obstructions  in the  Glands  and  Capillaries  and consequently create Pains and Diseases much more readily than vegetable Substances It is plain by Weight that the Substance of most animal Food is specifically heavier than that of most  Vegetables  commonly used for Food sometimes in the Proportion of three to two The  Fibres  and Juices of animal Bodies are not only more compact and closely united and have fewer  Vacuities  than those of Vegetables whereby the digestive Powers have less Difficulty in concocting and grinding equal Quantities of  Vegetable  than  animal Food  but by the less  Flavour  and  Savour  of vegetable than animal Food the Appetite is sooner satisfied and is under less Temptation to Excess in the first than in the latter and it  is consequently better and sooner digested circulated and secreted especially by tender and delicate digestive Powers and so cannot so readily cause  Viscidities  and  Obstructions Lastly  Infinite  Experiment  and the best  natural Philosophy  confirm to a Demonstration that those Substances which have least of  Salt  and  Sulphur  of  Spirit    Oil  and hard pungent Particles and most of soft Earth Water and Air are the fittest to circulate and be secreted through animal Tubes create least Resistance to the motive Powers tear rend and wear out the  Tubes  themselves least and form less obstinate and powerful Obstructions in the smaller Vessels and consequently that  vegetable  Substances which consist of a less Proportion of  Salts  and  Sulphurs    i e  of pungent and fiery Particles and of a greater Proportion of Earth Water and Air  i e  of less active and cooler Particles will be less ready to create Diseases and shorten Life than an equal Quantity of animal Substances which have all these in an  inverted  Proportion In a Word vegetable Substances are more  rare  less  compact  less  coherent  more easily dissolvable and digestible turn into a lighter  Chyle  have less  Salt    Oil  and  Spirit  and consequently are less heating and inflaming than animal Substances and so obstruct and tear animal Tubes less  § IF this Account be just and  philosophical  and if it be lawful at all to enquire into final Causes which if the first Being be  rational  and  intelligent  and acts with Design and for some End is not only lawful but laudable when done with Modesty and Humility then certainly  one  Part of his Design in permitting  animal  Food must of Necessity have been to shorten the  Duration  of human Life to  create  or at least to  permit  us by it to multiply and enrage Diseases Misery and Sufferings since it is evident to a Demonstration that it must always produce this Effect and will always have it preferable to  vegetable  Food and whatever  is  naturally and necessarily  is  and is permitted by the  first Being  we may with the utmost Certainty conclude was at least  one  Part of his Design and if Suffering Pain and Misery here be necessary for our  Purification  and  Recovery  out of this degenerate State then very probably that might be his Design in this Permission  This Phaenomenon  in Providence the Permission and Use of  animal  Food and  Fact  in  Revelation  is not accountable any otherwise than that Pain Suffering and Diseases being a natural and necessary Mean of  Expiation  and  Purification  in the Oeconomy of Restoration  Infinite Wisdom  permitted it tho' unwillingly as his  strange Work  against the Grain as it were for that End solely as a kind  Father  suffers his unnatural and perverse Son to be carried to  Gaol  to suffer Hunger Cold Pain and Confinement there as the only Mean to make him sober considerate wiser and better For that  animal Food  and  fermented  Liquors will more readily certainly and cruelly create and exasperate Diseases Pains and Sufferings and sooner cut off Life than  vegetable  Food will there can be no more Doubt than in any Proposition of  Euclid  if  Reason    Philosophy  the  Natures  of Things or  Experience  have Evidence or Force in them and it is very observable that this Indulgence for animal Food was not granted till the  Aera  of  Longaevity  was expir'd or at least they took place together and not till the spiritual Corruptions of  Pride    Tyranny    Malice    Revenge    Murder  and  brutal  Commerce so universally raged that infinite Wisdom to begin a new World was forced to destroy by a  Deluge  the whole Race of Mankind except a few of the most innocent and least deprav'd  Individuals  such as they were far from perfect but the least bad of the Race this seems so if any Credit be given to the  Jewish  History of Nature  § IT will be no Difficulty to one acquainted with  Revelation  to find the like Permissions in the divine  Oeconomy  Nothing is more plain and demonstrable from  Nature  and its  eternal Laws  and from Justice and Equity than that in the original Intention  one  Woman  was design'd for one  Man  and no more for there being no Difference between the  Sexes  but in their outward Frame and the  Configuration  of the Shell or Tabernacle their essential Nature and  spiritual  permanent Form being of the same Degree constant and invariable different  Culture  and Form makeing all the real Difference infinite Wisdom might then with the same Wisdom and  Propriety  have given the  Male  more  Eyes    Stomachs  or  Heads  as more  Wives  and yet for the  Hardness of their Hearts    God  permitted Plurality of Women to the  Jews  This same People tho' they had not only  God  's general and imperceptible  Providence  as we now have for their Government and Direction but his  miraculous  sensible and visible Presence to instruct and guide them yet they wanted a  King    as the other Nations had  and he gave them one in his  Wrath  Infinite Goodness intending always by the whole Power of his  Omnipotence  and  Omniscience  to restore his lapsed and rebellious Creatures consistent with their  Liberty  and the  natural Powers  he had given them and the  Harmony  of his own  Attributes  descends below his first Intention and drops the  primary  and  original  Perfection of his Commands to them for a Time to condescend to their Weakness and Infirmity in order afterwards to bring them up to it again As a kind  Father  who to wean his rash and giddy Child from the  Fire holds his Finger near a Candle till he begets a sensible Fear and Dread in him of being too familiar with that dangerous  Element  § UPON the Foot of  natural Religion  only and from the strict Rules of natural  Justice  and  Equity  how any one can justify the taking away the Life of a  FellowCreature  out of  Wantonness    Luxury  and  Riot  and not from Necessity and Selfdefence so long as there may be found sufficient Store of  vegetable  Food to carry on the Expences of  Living  and the more agreeable Performance of the  animal Functions  to give a living Creature the greatest Pain it can possibly receive and take from it the only Happiness it is capable of  viz  its  Life  which none can restore or recompense merely to scratch  callous Organs  more sensibly how I say to account for this barbarous and savage Wantonness on the foot of mere  natural Religion  and natural Equity only without  Revelation  I can by no means conceive That the infinitely wise  Author  and  Lawgiver  of Nature who sees through the whole  System  of  Intelligences  at once and perfectly knows for what Ends and Purposes he has made them and sent them here and is the sole  Proprietor  of Life and Happiness may dispose of them how he pleases knows when they have finish'd their  probatory  and  expiatory  Course and is  able to recompense the Loss of a  lower  Life by the Gift of a higher for it is not impossible the  Animals  may have been a lower Order of  rational Intelligences  who  lapsing  less are sooner and with less Suffering recover'd and since they suffer with us they may be restor'd with us the Apostle says  the whole Creation travelleth together  that is probably the whole  System  of  Saturn  the Goal of God's Creation For  Him  I say to give up the Lives of a lower Rank of Beings for the  Expiation    Instruction  or  Admonition  or other Benefit of a higher may be an Act of great  Justice    Wisdom  and  Goodness  And if it might be allow'd us to conjecture one wise  End  and Purpose in this  Permission  of  animal  Food might be to punish admonish and correct us by bodily Distempers so as to bring us to reflect repent and amend or even to shorten the Time of our Sufferings here and by the Violence of our Diseases and a nearer Prospect of  Death  and a future  Reckoning  to reclaim us sooner and more effectually and at the same Time to advance these  Victims  to a higher State of Being and Happiness Probably for these mention'd but to be sure for wise and good Ends and Purposes has  God  by  Revelation  given us a Permission or  Patent  for the Use of  animal  Food But for  fermented  Liquors  He  has given us none that I know of neither are they natural or proper nor were they ever approv'd  or recommended for common Use or as proper and ordinary Drink but only as  Physick  or a  Cordial  on  Festivals  or at  Sacrifices  on  Sickness  or in Extremities In the early and innocent Ages of  golden  Simplicity no Hint supposes them commonly known or tried And if fermented and spirituous Liquors were used only as  bitter Draughts    Cordials  and  chalybeat  Medicines to brace and wind up the Stomach and alimentary Tubes and Solids transiently for a short Time on Sickness Lowness Fainting Fatigue and  inclement  Seasons as they seem to be intended by the  Author  of Nature they might be Blessings and great temporary and transient Reliefs but as they are now used constantly at Meals as common  Beverage  to dilute solid Food and to make Persons easy under a Load of high rich animal Food they become the efficient Causes of most Diseases and upon the most  serious  Enquiry I could never find an  adequate  natural Cause for the Frequency of  nervous  and atrocious chronical Distempers now from what they were formerly nor of the  Stuntedness    Punyness  and Feebleness so conspicuous among the  better Sort  from what they were before the  Conquest  and in our  Gallic  Wars but the free and frequent Use of strong and  spirituous  Liquors and rich and high Foods with foreign  Cookery  at that Time introduced first and living in great Towns and using only Coaches and Chairs  and sedentary Employments and Diversions And drinking  Water  only and living  low  is the only  adequate Antidote  and Remedy for these Distempers thus produced for no Axiom is so certain in Physick as that  Diseases must be cured by their Contraries  § THE Hurt and Damage all  fermented  Liquors do an  animal  Body is evident from many Considerations as That it hardens constricts and binds up the Fibres and strongly unites the Particles of  animal  Substances so that they are with much greater Difficulty separated and divided  i e  digested A Piece of Meat will continue sweet and sound for many Years in Wine or strong Beer or in any strong fermented Liquor the Liquor cementing and pinning together the Parts of the Meat and the same happens when they are mixed in the Stomach by which the  Digestibility  and easy Dissolution of it is obstructed so that in such a Mixture  Mutton  is turned into  Beef  and  Beef  into  ShoeLeather  There is in strong Liquors a crisping corrugating or  caustic  Quality workt on the Fibres which burns and dries them up and destroys their  elastic  and  ductile  Virtue and consequently renders them unfit to be broken and divided in the Stomach This is evident from the Use commonly made of strong Beer as the best Plaister for  Sprains    Relaxations  and  Strains  and that Brandy will really stop  Haemorrhages  and Ruptures in the BloodVessels  by burning and wrinkling the tender Fibres and Capillaries and so by this crisping Quality must keep Food from being readily and perfectly digested The Fire and Heat in strong Liquors by stimulating and twitching the  Fibres  and Coats of the BloodVessels and Nerves and consequently bringing them into quick and frequent  Vibrations  and elastic Efforts will break and tear the Fibres of the alimentary Tubes and separate their Union and Continuity so as at last to wear out these Organs at least much sooner and with greater Pain and Suffering than Water or aqueous Liquors possibly can  Lastly  It is a common and wellknown Experiment that to  stunt  the Growth of young Animals as Dogs and Cats they need only be frequently rubbed over with Brandy Rum or any Spirit This stops the  Ductility  and Extension of the young animal  Fibres  that they cannot be dilated and develop'd by the Force of the Circulation and so  stunts  their Growth From all which it is plain that strong but especially  spirituous  Liquors are really  Poison  to an animal Constitution and their ill Effects not only in shortening the Lives but in stunting the Growth and Stature of the lower Rank of People from the late frequent Use of Gin Punch and other spirituous Liquors have become so flagrant as to call aloud for the just Indignation of the  Legislature  and it is to be wished that an effectual Remedy may be found out for so  destructive an Evil And I am fully convinced that the primary and original Design of the  Author of Nature  for the solid Food of Animals was nothing but earthy Particles mixed with Water and Air finely divided and cemented only with the least  Oil  and  Salt  possible as they are found in Seeds Fruits young Vegetables and  farinaceous  or  pulpous  Roots with Water only for Drink which alone would make the Animal last the longest and with the fewest Pains and Diseases But this Diet must be only tried and begun with the  Young  while their Fibres are tender and sweet  § THAT all sensitive as well as intelligent Creatures are in an  expiatory    purifying  and  progressive  State here and going on to a greater Degree of Perfection and a nobler State of Being in their several Orders is demonstrable from the utter Contradiction and Impossibility there must be that an infinitely wise and good Being could create sentient and intelligent Beings to  suffer  for no other Reason but for the sake of  Suffering  or that he should make Creatures to  suffer  for any other End or Purpose but for  Expiation    Purification  and  progressive Perfection  of Being and to establish and confirm them in their acquired State of Perfection  Neque enim    sub justo Deo    miser esse quisquam    nisi mereatur    possit  says St  Augustin  most divinely Most of  the  Animals  are  Martyrs  for the human  Species  in Food or  Sacrifice  Some of them are Food for one another all of them are subject to  epidemical  Diseases and casual Misfortunes a few of them pass their Time much more comfortably than others all of them but unhappily at best and go through Death at last All this must be for some wise Purpose and none can be nobler than that of  Expiation    Purification  and  progressive Perfection  of Being and silent  Admonition  and teaching  us  their superior  Order  of  Beings Consciousness  of this End either to them or us might retard this Effect  Childhood    Idiotism  and many  cephalic  and  nervous  Distempers can bring no  Consciousness  of the divine End and Design of this  Oeconomy  along with them even to intelligent Beings it is sufficient that  Consciousness  come when the End is accomplished or the designed  Perfection  attained At what Time  animal  Food came first in Use is not certainly known He was a bold Man who made the first  Experiment    Illi robur et aes triplex circa pectus erat  To see the Convulsions Agonies and Tortures of a poor  FellowCreature  whom they cannot restore nor recompense dying to gratify  Luxury  and scratch  callous  and rank  Organs  must require a rocky Heart and a great Degree of Cruelty and Ferocity I cannot find any great Difference on the Foot of natural Reason and  Equity  only between feeding on  human Flesh  and feeding on brute animal Flesh except  Custom  and  Example  I believe some rational Creatures would suffer less in being fairly butcher'd than a strong  Ox  or  red Deer  and in natural  Morality  and Justice the Degrees of Pain here make the  essential  Difference for as to other Differences they are relative only and can be of no Weight with an  infinitely perfect Being  Did not  Use  and  Example  weaken this Terror and make the Difference Reason alone could never do it Perhaps it may be conjectur'd that since  Sacrifices  were certainly an  original    reveal'd  or  traditional  Institution and that no Nation under the Sun hitherto known was without them they being it would seem a chief Part in the grand  Oeconomy  of the  Restoration  Sacrifice I say might have been originally instituted To  admonish  and  inform the Sinner  silently and without committing Violence on his  Liberty  what he deserves and implicitly to tell him that he deserves the same  Death  he makes the poor Brute undergo For the  Liberty  of Mankind seems so precious being the Root of Intelligence that it is wonderful in how many Shapes  infinite Wisdom  and  Goodness  has put Himself in the Conduct of  Providence  and Nature to preserve it inviolate and at the same time to instruct and admonish his free lapsed Intelligences I believe a good natural  Philosopher  might shew with great  Reason and Probability that there is scarce  Beast    Bird    Reptile  nor  Insect  that does not in each particular  Climat  instruct and admonish Mankind of some necessary Truth for their Happiness either in Body or Mind And To continue the  Expectation  of all Ages of some more noble and meritorious  Sacrifice  some time or other to be celebrated And it is not impossible that the rude and untaught  Mob  who were employed in the lower servile Offices about  Sacrifices  might have been the first who ventured on  animal  Food if it was not instituted afore as a  Sacrament  with the same Intention as the  Eucharist  was afterwards their Station habituating them to bear with less Pain the Sufferings of their FellowCreatures while sacrificed and they finding it  palatable  and  luscious  might recommend the Use of it to Others Perhaps I say this might have been the Original Institution of  animal  Food among all  Nations  However as this is only a remote Conjecture to account for the early Commencement of  animal  Food so contrary to the original Nature of Man and the Design of the  Creator  and has no Regard to those concern'd in our unbloody Sacrifice I proceed now to observe how cautiously and with what an evident  Forbid  the  Jewish  Law directs this  Permit  of animal Food  viz  absolutely and positively not to eat the  Blood  of the  Animal  in which not only its Life but its  most delicious Savour and most  deleterious  Qualities chiefly consist and because Blood  Globules  by their Rotundity Volubility and Elasticity resist  Trituration  that is Digestion Now this in Reality and by  Insinuation  and  Moral  is to say That since for the  Hardness  of your Hearts and your present unconquerable Lustings you cannot be brought to abstain altogether from  animal  Food yet because in the  Blood  is the  Life thereof  and all its deleterious morbific and noxious Qualities you are to drain it as much as possible of all its Moisture and Juice for the Serum as well as the Grume mostly consists of  globular  Particles and eat it plain roasted or boiled to drain it still more By this Method  animal  Food will be much less pernicious and will approach very near to  Vegetables  There is no understanding this  Permission  any other Way nor is it otherwise to be reconciled to common Sense or rational Conception however both  Jews  and  Christians  have at present dwindled and diluted its true Import out of Luxury  § THIS Doctrine is further confirm'd by this surprising Circumstance in the Permission that there is a very particular and otherwise unintelligible Distinction made between  clean  and  unclean  Beasts either to be sacrificed or eaten for Food and a distinguishing  Mark  assign'd how to know the last And  since it comes from the same Source with the  Permission  of  animal  Food these two must have some material Difference in the Nature of Things and that can be none other but that the Flesh of these last cannot be so readily digested and squeezed from their Blood but that it will have sufficient remaining of a more deleterious Nature to inflame and  mortify  the Juices of those who use it freely and to enrage and  madden  their Passions and he who is deeply acquainted with  natural Philosophy  and the  History  of the unclean  Animals  will be sensible of the Justness of this Prohibition and Observation From whence it is natural to conclude that tho' for the  Hardness  and Perverseness of Mens Hearts  animal  Food was permitted and indulged yet it was with such various  Clogs  and  Exceptions  as might make it as little pernicious as possible For the same Reason likewise was the  Fat  of the  Sacrifice  forbid to be eaten And all this to shew that it was with great  Reluctancy  and in mere Condescension and contrary to the  original  Intention it was thus permitted And tho' under the new Dispensation St  Peter  was informed by a  miraculous Vision  that nothing was now  common  or  unclean  yet it was not till  Selfdenial    Poverty of Spirit  and  Mortification  or abstaining from the Lusts of the Flesh were established as the fundamental Doctrines of this new  System  which when sincerely believed and strictly followed would leave no  room for Difference of Food or  ceremonial  Distinctions which served only as a  Schoolmaster  to bring them to these purer and more universal Doctrines of  Christ  It is certain at the Creation there could be no such Thing as an Indulgence for  animal  Food if only  Pairs  of each  Animal  were created at first  § I MUST however own that I think some  vegetable  Food of much  Salt    Oil  or luscious Juice and  Poignancy  as much or more deleterious inflaming and incrassating than some mild animal Substances For Example  Onions    Shallot    Mustard    Horseradish  all the  Nutkinds    Eastern Gums    Balsams    Raisins    Pickles    Spices    Aromatics  strong fermented  Sours  rich and fat late Fruits as dry yet  plump Grapes  much  Sugar  and the like these are in some delicate Constitutions more poisonous and hurtful to an human Body than a Bit of the  muscular  and lean Flesh of  Chicken    Veal    Lamb    Rabbit    Partridge    Turkey  and the like white and young animal Foods whose Whiteness and Tenderness shews there is little or no red  Blood Globules  in them and are consequently more easily digestible and less deleterious These  Vegetables  may be allowed in small Quantities as a  Sauce  or  Relish  to otherwise insipid and unpalatable vegetable Food to sickly Appetites but in great Quantities and without Caution they will hurt heat and thicken the Blood and Juices of tender Constitutions  which is the sole Cause of the acute Distempers of all the  Eastern  and  Southern  Nations who do not deal or but very sparingly in strong fermented Liquors Without doubt plain  Milk  the genuine Soup prepar'd by the Author of Nature and of a middle Nature between animal and vegetable Substances boiled or raw or prepared with Seeds as  Rice    Sago    Barley    Wheat    Millet  and the like is the best and safest of all Foods for such tender Constitutions as being in itself Blood that has not as yet often passed through the Lungs to give it its  scarlet Colour  and deleterious Qualities but is drawn almost directly from the Stomach and Lacteals from an  Emulsion  made there and Cookery of Nature of Grass and Vegetables with pure Water and designed by the  Author of Nature  for the Cure and Nourishment of the Young Tender and Delicate And I can see no Difference between a young or tender and delicate Animal by Nature and one made so by a Disease but that such a Diet is still more necessary for the last than for the first The mealy Roots and early Fruits are next to these such as  Potatoes    Turnips    Carrots    Skirrets  and the like  Strawberries    Cherries    Currants    c  and only in the last Place and Degree is the  Saladin    Colworts  and latter and richer Fruitkinds and Winter Vegetables as containing too much Air or Wind And the  Author of Nature  has with such a Profusion of Kindness  secured against Want or Famine that in inclement Seasons and bad Years if the Earth cannot produce Plenty  above  Ground it secures it  under  Ground in bulbous knotted or mealy Roots even in Snow or Frost  § AGAINST this Doctrine that animal Food was permitted for a  Punishment  and that fermented Liquors are not an Institution of Nature and its Author those who have Regard for  Revelation  whence the Patent for animal Food is drawn may object that our  blessed Saviour  who was  without Sin  eat and drank of what was set before him that his first  Miracle  was supernaturally producing Wine to celebrate the Marriage of  Cana  in  Galilee  that he was accounted a Winebiber that he eat and drank with  Publicans  and  Sinners  that he wrought other  Miracles  to produce  animal Food  to a Multitude that St  Peter  had a  miraculous Vision  to instruct him that no sort of Food was unclean that the  Eucharist  is celebrated in Wine and that St  Paul  advises  Timothy  to drink Wine for his Infirmities To all which I answer That the Question is not what is now best and fittest in the  present  Ends of Providence in order to restore and recover Man from his lapsed and fallen State but what was probably the first Design of our  Creator  in our primitive unlapsed State before we and our Habitation the  Earth  with its  Atmosphere  and Appendages  were thus spoilt and disordered One sort of Repair Props or Support may be proper or necessary for a Habitation in one Degree of Ruin and Decay that would by no Means be necessary or proper in another or lower Degree There is neither  Virtue  nor  Vice  in abstaining from one sort of Food more than another but as it is commanded by lawful Superiors all that is here considered is which of the two  vegetable  or  animal  Food in the Nature of Things by the  animal Oeconomy  and as human Creatures and their Food are now constituted is  physically  and experimentally fittest to carry on and prolong Life with the least Pain fewest Diseases and for the longest Time  Virtue  and  Vice  are of quite another Consideration and depend on the  internal Principle  and Disposition the Quantity Manner and Order in which these necessary Supports are taken not on the Things themselves But if it be asked Which of the two  Diets  is most conducive to  Virtue  or  Vice  Which of the two is most likely to facilitate the Acquisition of  Virtue  What is abovesaid plainly determines it in Favour of a  low Diet  for by it the bodily Passions being made cooler and weaker the Blood and Juices being sweetened the intellectual  Organs  thereby render'd cleaner more agile and penetrating  Reason  and the  spiritual Nature  of Man has more Liberty to act and meets with less Difficulty and Resistance in its Operations  As to our blessed  Saviour  he having come to seek and to save what was lost was obliged to take the World as he found it in order to raise it from that Degree of  Perdition  in which it was then plunged He took upon him the Form of a  Servant  he took not the Nature of  Angels  but the Nature of the Seed of  Abraham  he was in all things like unto us  Sin only excepted  Those to whom he came and among whom he dwelt and convers'd could at first neither receive nor understand his  sublime Doctrines  he had many Things to say even to his Disciples which they could not then  bear  and yet this Doctrine of the Preference and greater Advantages of  vegetable  than of  animal  Food is virtually and implicitly contain'd in the general Doctrine of  Selfdenial  and  Poverty of Spirit  in the Sense of the  Evangelic Counsels  that carry quickest into  Perfection  where  Celibacy  is preferr'd to  Marriage  for in the Kingdom of  Glory  they are neither married nor given in Marriage but are as the  Angels  of God so strongly and preeminently inculcated in the Gospel as any who reads and considers it must plainly see I readily grant and have given the Reasons and  Philosophy  of these Things that in our present lapsed State in the present Infertility and insufficiently nutritive Qualities of the  Vegetables  in the present Curse on the Earth and the Necessity of Labour Handicrafts  mechanical  Force and  martial  Prowess while Wickedness is so powerful  and the Wicked so numerous there is a Necessity for high  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors in some Cases and to some Persons to secure against and remedy these Evils But the sole  Question  here is Whether this Diet will prevent Diseases or lengthen Life so effectually as the other Or whether Providence has not designed and appointed vegetable Food for the  Cure  and  Antidote  of the Pains and Diseases naturally and necessarily arising from animal Food and fermented Liquors Perhaps  God  in his moral Government of the World has design'd animal Food more readily to punish those who will not be drawn by Love and Beauty  ie  to purify some sorts of Men by Pains and Sufferings I willingly allow that  fermented  and sometimes  spirituous  Liquors are excellent Remedies temporary Filips Whips or Spurs in Faintness Sickness Labour or festival Occasions for  Joy  and promoting of Friendship and on Necessities and in Extremities But I contend then and then only they ought to be used and that there is neither Precept Example nor Encouragement from  Reason    Experience  or  Revelation  to use them otherwise or as they are now used for  common  Food and daily  Beverage  whence they become one Cause of all the great Diseases of the present Age From these general Considerations all the mention'd Difficulties have an easy  Solution  to the Candid and Ingenuous I am not fighting  Prizes  nor making Articles of a  Creed  That infinite Wisdom foresaw and laid in Provision and the necessary Precaution and  Antidote  for the most deleterious Effects of animal Food and fermented Liquors for a short time seems to me evident for these Reasons In that He provided the  Liver  the  Pancreas  and other internal  Glands  in Animals these vastly strong complicated and elabour'd  Organs  to draw out the most poisonous Parts of strong Meats and Drinks the stronger the  Liver  and the larger that  Organ  grows the more  Bile  it throws out on the  Commonshoar  the  Intestines  to deprive the Chyle of its churlish Salts and acrid  Sulphurs  and thus makes the  Liver  an useful Medicine to promote the animal Functions  Digestion    Chylification  and the  peristaltic Motion  and then throw its useless Parts out of the Habit By the createing mineral and ponderous Medicines  Mercury  chiefly to open Obstructions break saline Concretions and dissolve the  Tenacity  of the  Globules  and  Serum  And In providing  mineral  Waters of so various and complicated Natures for the same Ends and Purposes which they will wellchosen effect at last as certainly as those formerly mentioned Now it is plain to a  Demonstration  that under a vegetable Diet all those have little or no Use in Medicine nay any one who is acquainted with the Delicacy Tenderness and Sensibility of the internal and infinitely minute Parts of  an animal Machine must know that they are not only in a great Degree useless but hurtful and tend to tear dissolve and destroy the infinitely minute Fibrils of which the Solids of an  animal Machin  are formed So that their final End and Design in Providence must have been to  antidote  the ill Effects of  animal Food  and strong  fermented Liquors  to a certain Degree and for a certain Time  probably  till some time after the Meridian of Life while the Organs had attained their utmost Extension and Firmness for it is not improbable that none of the Mineral Waters existed under the  Form  and in the Manner they now appear till after the  Deluge  the  Aera  of  animal Food    fermented Liquors  and the  shortness of Life  § To the Appearance of the present State of Nature that seems to clash with this Doctrine  viz  the vast nay infinite Mass of  Life  or  living Creatures  generated by Heat and Moisture the many  Millions  of  organiz'd  Seeds of  Plants  and  Animals  destroyed every Season the Impossibility of having any Sort of  Food  or even  pure  Water without destroying and devouring  Millions  of  Animaculs  that  here  almost each Animal devours and lives upon another and that both in the  sentient  and  intelligent  Creation there seems to be a natural and unconquerable Appetite and craveing Desire of  animal  Food and an insatiable  Thirst of Blood To these and suchlike Prejudices I cannot call them Objections it may be answer'd I First That these Facts are not denied but are of no Weight against the Propositions here chiefly asserted  viz  That it is  Philosophically  certain that  animal  Food is in its own Nature more ready to produce Distempers than vegetable Food That it is therefore highly probable that an infinitely good and wise Being would not appoint in his first Intention  animal  but  vegetable  Food at least to his  intelligent  and rational Creation and which accordingly is confirm'd from  Revelation  And The chief Assertion here made is That in Consequence of these two  Propositions  it follows that  vegetable  Food Seeds especially must be the proper  Antidote  and Cure of the Diseases brought on by  animal  Food But II It may be consider'd as St  Paul  asserts that this whole  Creation  the whole  System  but chiefly this our  Globe  with all its Inhabitants  labours  and is under a  mortal  Distemper and in  Travail  like a parturient Woman to throw off this present  Load of Corruption    Deteriority  and  Lapse  that it may regain its original  Spirituality    Purity  and  Liberty  it is at present in a State of  Expiation    Purification  and  progressive Perfection  every Thing is out of its natural Order the  System  is as it were in a Fever and every Part and Particle is in Action like the Body of a Man in a  febrile Fermentation  to throw off its peccant Humours  and to bring the whole Compound into  Order    Regularity  and  perfect Health  But III These very Appearances on which the Objection is founded confirm to a  Demonstration  what I assert  viz  That all  animal  Life here is in an  expiatory    purifying  and  progressive  State towards its original Perfection for it would be the grossest Contradiction to suppose that an  infinitely good  and  wise  Being should give Pain to any of his Creatures for any other End but to reclaim and perfect them that He alone knows when his  Justice    Purity  and the  Amende Honorable  and the Infection of Impurity are perfectly answer'd and cancelled in their present State of  Melioration  and so knows when and how it is fittest to put an End to it by Death that is by the Rupture and Dissolution of their gross and earthy  Prison  form'd out of this our ruinous  planetary System  now spoil'd and defac'd to set the indwelling  spiritual  Inhabitant free into some more  pure  and  refin'd System  and that  animal  Life of all Kinds and Degrees does and must necessarily suffer here by bodily Wants and Infirmities by the Injuries and Inclemencies of  Seasons  by the  Rapacity  and  Ferocity  of their FellowCreatures besides a thousand other  Accidents  and at last most intensely by their Death and the Rupture of their outward Shell or Tabernacle From all this is a plain Demonstration that they are in a State of Suffering Expiation and progressive Purification and  that at last they will all be set at Liberty and become the Sons and Children of God in some Degree or Order or other according to his original Intention and the Plan of this his universal  Monarchy  and Kingdom laid before the Foundation of the World and all this Darkness Sufferings and unintelligible Play is only to save human Liberty and produce at last  pure Love  and  naked Faith  IV No body ever denied that  Animals  of all Kinds might be destroyed even  intelligent  as well as  sentient  when it is done for some wise or useful Purpose as in  Selfdefence  or even for moral Purposes implicitly to admonish and teach others their Duty what they deserve or what they are to  believe  and  hope  these Purposes with all their particular Circumstances are under the  moral  Government of an infinitely wise Being The only  Question  here is Whether they may reasonably and justly be put to  Pain  unnecessarily and  wantonly  or for no wise End or Purpose but only to scratch  callous  Pallates when other Means of Health may be had more effectual and no less pleasant V It is not altogether  Fact  that Animals devour one another from any other Reason but for Want of sufficient Plenty of proper vegetable Food as Seeds tender Plants mealy Roots and the like which even the most  carnivorous  Animals will brouze on when they can meet with it in Plenty as is well known in  natural History  and even the  Fish which of all Animals are the most  voracious  will readily feed on Balls of Meal and Milk without offering to devour one another as the  ingenious  Mr  Andrews  of  Norfolk  has found by Experiment for having put several Sorts of small and great Fishes together into a large whiten'd  Pond  of clear Water where they might all be easily seen and number'd and feeding them with Balls made of Milk and Flower which were put into pervious  Troughs  he found at least thought that they did not offer the least Violence to one another VI Allowing Animals to be actuated by a spiritual or immaterial Principle of the same  Nature  with intelligent Creatures yet they are not of the same Degree and Order with them they may be  intelligent  Creatures of an  inferior Order  beginning lower and verging more slowly towards their intended Perfection they may be under different Conditions of Purification and may pass the whole of their Duration here in the State of  Infants  who dye before they are born or before they arrive at the Use of Reason and yet in other States of Being may grow and advance to a much higher Perfection of  Sensation  and  Intelligence  than we can readily imagine For to me it seems utterly incredible that any Creature whether  sentient  or  intelligent  should come into this  State  of Being and Suffering for no other Purpose than we see them attain here and it is equally incredible that any Creature should  spontaneously exert animal and muscular Function  ie  should live and feel without some Degree of an  immaterial    immortal  and  selfactive  Spirit Matter and its Laws can never account for such Appearances There must be some infinitely beautiful wise and good  Scene  remaining for all  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings the Discovery of which will ravish and astonish us one Day Moderately wise Ends Purposes and Means are unworthy of infinite Perfection whatever  God  does must be every way worthy of Himself His  Working  may serve many wise and good Ends and Purposes here but the last and great End of all must be of  Dignity  and  Majesty  worthy of Him tho' we cannot yet a great while comprehend it  § To conclude It is plain from  Revelation  that  animal Food  was  permitted  and  fermented Liquors  not  forbidden  and consequently that there is neither  Virtue  nor  Vice  in the Use of them absolutely but in the Order Time Quantity and other Circumstances of their Usage That in our present  Situation  and under our present Circumstances for  some  Persons and in Order for  some  Purposes a reasonable Quantity of  animal Food  and  fermented Liquors  may be absolutely necessary It is plain from  Reason    Philosophy  and  Experience  that  Excesses  in high  animal Food  and  strong fermented Liquors    are the true efficient and most general Cause of most  atrocious  and dangerous Distempers and consequently that  vegetable Food  and  unfermented Liquors  are the true and natural  Antidote  of such Distempers That  animal Food  and  fermented Liquors  will more probably and more naturally cause Distempers and shorten Life than  vegetable Food  and  unfermented Liquors  That a moderate and small Quantity of  animal Food  and  generous fermented Liquors  will naturally tighten harden and strengthen give Firmness and Force to animal Solids and Fibres and enrich warm and invigorate the Blood and Juices and consequently is safest to all subject to eruptive Distempers as Gout Erisipelas  c  in the  Fits  But at the same time that it hardens and tightens the Solids it condenses and thickens the Juices and renders the Animal of a shorter  Duration  of Life and more subject to  Diseases Lastly  That for bodily Strength  animal Food  and  fermented Liquors  seem fittest but for  intellectual  Exercises  vegetable Food  and  unfermented Liquors  seem appropriated and that consequently the best Way to secure the  golden Mediocrity  between  bodily  Strength and  spiritual  Force the State fittest for the Generality of Mankind is for the healthy to confine themselves to about a Pound at least half a Pound of  animal Food  and a Pint at least half a Pint of  fermented Liquors    daily But for the unhealthy  valetudinary  and studious to sink below this  Medium  in both these till by Experience and Observation they find that Quantity of either they are easiest under and to stick to that should it even be to descend totally into Vegetables Milk and Seeds with unfermented Liquors  END of the SECOND DISCOURSE  DISCOURSE III A Philosophical THEORY FOUNDED ON EXPERIMENTS OF THE NATURE and LAWS OF Minute Inanimat Bodies AND THEIR SYSTEMS in general  Rom viii  For we know that the whole Creation groaneth and travaileth in Pain till now  DISCOURSE III  A Philosophical THEORY Founded on EXPERIMENTS OF THE NATURE and LAWS of Minute INANIMAT BODIES and their  Systems  in general  PREFACE  THAT the  Curious  and  Philosophical  Reader who possibly may be entertain'd with such  Speculations  may have in one general View what has been or will be incidentally hinted in my preceding and succeeding Works concerning the Nature of  Minute Bodies  their  Systems  and  Laws  I have collected into a few  Propositions  what I have found scatter'd in the  Works of  Philosophers  and  Mathematicians  of most Note on that Subject particularly those of Sir  Isaac Newton  These I have connected the best I could and in some Particulars have adventur'd to supply with Conjectures by  Analogy  from their general Nature leaving every one to judge for himself according to his  Taste  and  Liking  there being nothing of what is here laid down very material to the practical Part of these Discourses  PROPOSITION I  THE  Elements  or least and last Particles of  Matter  are of various  Sizes    Densities  and  Figures  Those of the  first Order  or the very least are almost infinitely small hard and  elastic  pervading all Bodies but pervious to none such as are probably the Particles of the  Etherial  or  Newtonian  Fluid The Particles of the  second Order  are compos'd of these and consequently are of a greater Size but less  dense  and  elastic  being pervious to the Particles of the first Order and themselves pervading all others Of this kind are probably the Particles of  Light  The Particles of the  third  and last  Order  are compos'd of those of the second Order bearing such Proportion to them in Size  Density  and  Elasticity  as they do to those of the  first Order  SCHOLIUM  IT is beyond all Doubt that the Quantity of  solid  Matter in this material  System  is very small in respect of the interspers'd  Vacuities  It is demonstrably certain that a solid  Cube  or  Sphere  of a Mile or Furlong or even a Yard in  Diameter  being divided sufficiently small and its Parts ranged in a proper  Order  would furnish  Solidity  enough to answer all Appearances Suppose the Particles all  Cubes  and to be so united by the  Contact  of their  Angles  as to make  cubical  Interstices then the  Vacuity  would be equal to the  Solidity  and since Matter is divisible  in infinitum  this Vacuity may be encreas'd to any Proportion of  Majority  We actually find that  Water  and  Mercury  will pass through the  Pores  of  Gold  and Sir  Isaac Newton  has demonstrated that  Gold  must have many times more  Pores  than solid  Parts  and yet it is the heaviest of all Bodies  Light  passes through the most opake Bodies when shreded sufficiently thin it scarce meets with any Resistance in its Passage through clear  Glass  and  Aether  pervades all Bodies with very little or no Resistance From all which it manifestly appears how small a Proportion there is between the  Solidity  and  Vacuities  in our  System  PROP II  THE  Elements  of Bodies or the least and last Particles of whatever  Order  are solid hard and indivisible at least by natural and created Powers else it would be in the Power of  Natural Means  and created Agents to alter the present  Constitution  and  Nature  of Things For a  World  made up of Particles broken and worn out would be quite different from what it now is and altogether insufficient to answer the Ends and Purposes of  Nature  PROP III  Analogous  to of the same Nature and probably from the same Cause with  Gravity  in the great Bodies of Universe the  Sun    Planets  and  Fixt Stars  which acts as the Squares of the Distance reciprocally there is in the least and  elementary  Particles of Matter a Principle of  Attraction  and  Repulsion  whereby they  attract  and  repell  one another according to some constant and invariable  Law  whatever that may be  SCHOL I  WHAT this  Law  is by which the  Particles  of  Matter attract  and  repel  each other no Observations or Experiments hitherto made have been sufficient to determine only thus much is certain that in receding from the Point of  Contact  it decreases in a greater Proportion  than that of the  duplicate Ratio  of the Distance  reciprocally  for by that Law the Force of  Attraction  at any small assignable Distance would be nearly the same whereas it is manifest from Observation and Experience that it is exerted only at or near the Point of  Contact  Sir  Isaac Newton  has calculated from the  Inflection  of the Rays of  Light  that the attracting Force in the Point of Contact is times greater than the Force of  Gravity  and the ingenious Mr  Hales  has shewn by a great Variety of  Experiments  that the  repulsive  or  elastic  Force which probably arise from one and the same Cause in some sorts of  Particles  are likewise  immensly  great  SCHOL II  IF  Particles  mutually  attract  each other as the  Cubes  of their Distances  reciprocally  the Force of  Attraction  in the Point of  Contact  will be infinitely greater than at any assignable Distance According to  this  Law which seems to obtain at least very nearly in the smallest  Particles  of  Matter  if the Force of  Attraction  in the Point of  Contact  be not infinitely greater than the Force of  Gravity  it will be infinitely  less  than that Force of  Gravity  at any assignable Distance But tho' the Force of  Attraction  in the Point of  Contact  is very great yet it is not infinitely greater than the Force of  Gravity  seeing the Parts of  any Body may be separated by a finite assignable Force and therefore at a  given  Distance it must vanish or become  infinitely  small  SCHOL III  REPULSION  begins and goes on where  Attraction  ends and o constitutes the middle Point in the  Progression  between them or o  i e  infinitely small of the same Order is the last Term and Limit of  Attraction  and the first of  Repulsion  and they probably go on according to the same  Law  and  Progression  tho' with contrary Directions For as Sir  Isaac Newton  observes those Particles which recede from one another with the greatest  repulsive  Force and are with the greatest Difficulty brought together cohere most strongly when brought into  Contact  PROP IV  THE  Cohesion  of the small Particles of Matter is in the  compound Proportion  of the  Quantity  of their cohering  Surfaces  and the  Quantity  of their  attractive  Powers and their  attractive  Powers are  caeteris paribus  as their  Densities  or the Quantities of Matter they contain  COROL  HENCE it follows that the less the cohering  Surfaces  are  caeteris paribus  the less will be the Degree of  Cohesion  and that the  least Degree of  Cohesion  is when the  Surfaces  touch in a Point only or are  Spheres  or  Spheroides  PROP V  THE Power or Force of  Attraction  in small Particles of Matter increases as the Size of the Particles is diminish'd For as this Force acts only in or near the Point of  Contact  it will be proportional to that  Contact  or in the  compound Ratio  of the  Density  of the Particles and the  Largeness  of their  Surfaces  but the  Surfaces  decrease as the  Squares  of the  Diameters  while the  Solidities  decrease as their  Cubes  and therefore the smallest Particles of Matter having the largest  Surfaces  in Proportion to their  Solidities  and more of their Points coming into  Contact  will have the greatest  attractive  Force in Proportion to their  Bulk  PROP VI  THE  Gravities  of Particles decrease as the  Cubes  of their  Diameters  for their  Gravities  are as their Quantities of Matter which in  homogeneous  Bodies are as the  Cubes  of the  Diameters  COROL  HENCE it is that  Mercury  from the Smallness and Divisibility of its Parts is so easily raised and that Bodies may be suspended in  Fluids specifically  lighter than themselves  PROP VII  IF the Parts of a Body immers'd in a  Fluid  are more strongly  attracted  by the  Fluid  than they are by one another they will mutually recede from each other with a  Force  equal to the Excess of the one  Attraction  above the other and will be equally diffus'd through the Fluid And hence the Nature of  Solution    Separation  and  Diffusion  PROP VIII  IF  Particles  suspended in a  Fluid  and  attracting  each other are  elastic  after their  Collision  they will  resile  from one another and meeting with other Particles they will be  reflected  till by such  Actions  and  Reactions  a  Fermentation    Effervescence  and  Ebullition  is produced  PROP IX  IF  Particles  suspended in a  Fluid  and  attracting  each other are not  elastic  they will not be reflected from one another but coalesce into  Masses  till their  Gravity  exceeding that of the  Fluid  they will sink and be precipitated The same thing will be produced by increasing or diminishing the Gravity of the  Menstruum  in which the Particles are suspended  PROP X  THE  Figures  of the Elements of all pure  unelastic  and incompressible  Fluids  must necessarily be  spherical  or at least approaching thereto for were they of any other  Figure  their  Surfaces  would touch in more Points than one and consequently they would  cohere  And the  Elements  of solid Bodies probably may be of the Figure of some one or other of the regular Solids as  Cubes    Triangles    Prisms    c  so that their Surfaces coming into  Contact  they may attract each other with the greater Force  SCHOL  WHAT may be the Figure of the Elements of  elastic  Fluids as the Air and the  Newtonian Aethereal Fluid  is not material to enquire since their  Fluidity  does not arise from the Figure but the  repulsive  Force of their Particles  PROP XI  THE  Elasticity  of solid Bodies is the Effect of the  attracting  Force of their Particles for when the small contiguous and cohering Particles of a Body are by a  Stroke  or any external Violence separated from each other to extremely small Distances if this  Force  is taken off the separated Particles will by the Force of  Attraction  rush back into their  Contacts  with an accelerated  Velocity  and the Body will recover its pristin Figure But if the Particles are so far separated as to be without their  Spheres  of  Attraction  they will remain in that  Disjunction  and the Body will be uncapable of recovering its former State  PROP XII  THAT Bodies under a  Rotation  fly off in the  Tangent  is only a Consequence of that general  Law  by which they persevere in the same State of Rest or moving uniformly in a  streight  Line unless they are made to change that  State  by some external Force impressed for the Direction of a Body moving in the  Circumference  of a  Circle  is in the  Tangent  and it is made to describe the  Circle  only by the  central Attraction  which ceasing to act the Body will proceed in its proper Direction or will fly off in the  Tangent  PROP XIII  THE  Figures  of Bodies and their Actions on one another arising from the Principles of  Attraction  and  Repulsion  together with the Motions impressed on them by  living  and  intelligent  Agents will probably account for most of the Appearances of the  material  World if  mechanically  adjusted and treated according to these mentioned Laws  PROP XIV  AIR is a  System  of Particles endued with a  repulsive  Force which being fixt in all  animal    vegetable  and  mineral  Substances are by  Fire    Fermentation    Putrefaction    Dissolution  or any other  intestine Action  or  Reaction  set at Liberty and thrown off into an  elastic  State and carrying along with them  Ramenta  or Abrasions of the Bodies they were fixt in they compose our Atmosphere which is a  Chaos  of such Particles of various  Solidities    Gravities  and  attractive  and  repulsive  Powers acting by the establish'd  Laws  of  minute  Bodies and hence its  Compression    Weight    Elasticity  and various Degrees of  Density  SCHOL  THE  Density  of the  Air  is proportionate to its  Compression  and therefore the  centrifugal  or  expansive  Force by which its Particles endeavour to recede from one another must be in the  reciprocal  Proportion of their Distances or in the direct  subtriplicate Ratio  of their  Densities  PROP XV  EARTH  is only a loose Collection of the different  elementary  Particles of Matter of all the three Orders thrown together without any regular Combination or  Cohesion  as  Whiteness  is a Blending and Mixture of all the differentlycolour'd  Rays  of  Light  PROP XVI  WATER  is a Collection of the Solutions of tasteless and insipid  Salts  originally  fixt    crystalis'd  and  dispers'd  quite through the  Globe  but kept in  Fluidity  by Heat like melted Lead And different  Salts  are Water united with a little  Air  and some  Earths    acid  or  sulphureous  in a  crystalis'd  State as  Ice  is Water congeal'd and Water is  Ice  dissolv'd But this is not intended as a Definition but only as an Illustration All Salts are soluble by Water and all Water evaporated drops a  saline  Substance mixt with  Earths  PROP XVII  ACIDS  seem to be compos'd of such elementary Particles as are endued with a very great  attractive  Power whence by insinuating themselves into the  Pores  of Bodies and  attracting  their Particles more strongly than these Particles  attract  one another they thereby separate and divide them  SCHOL  POSSIBLY the Figures of Acids may be  triangular Prisms  or such like to facilitate their Entry into Bodies and to separate their Particles like Wedges for all Matter must have some Figure  PROP XVIII  HEAT  as it is a Property of Bodies is only the brisk  vibrating Action  and  Reaction  of the  elastic repelling Nitre  of the  Air  and the  aethereal Fluid  with the strongly  attracting acid Sulphur  which  Sulphur  by its  Analysis  is found to contain an inflammable Oil an  acid Salt  a very fixt Earth and a little  Metal  COROL  HENCE the  Affinity  between  Light  and  sulphureous  Bodies and the true Nature of  Oils  and  inflammable Spirits  which are nothing but a great deal of  Sulphur  a fine or light  acid Salt  a very little  Water  and  Earth  SCHOL  SINCE it has been found that a  Thermometer  in an exhausted Receiver will rise and fall as much and almost as soon as another  Thermometer  placed by it in the open Air it seems to follow that  Heat  is conveyed and propagated from one Body to another by some  subtle elastic Fluid  pervading all Bodies and it is not improbable that the  Vibrations  of this  Medium  in hot Bodies contribute to the Intenseness and Duration of their  Heat  And since smooth polish'd Bodies with  plain Surfaces  cling together as strongly in an  exhausted  Receiver as in the  open Air it is not improbable that their  Cohesion  may be caused by this same  Medium  Both Experiments go a great way to ascertain the  Existence  and Necessity of some such  aethereal Fluid  PROP XIX  LIGHT  seems to be the  vibrating  Particles of a hot Body driven off by the  repelling  Force with an  immense Velocity  which is continued and augmented by the  aethereal Fluid  and the  Attraction  of the Bodies it meets with in its Progress  SCHOL I  SINCE as Sir  Isaac Newton  has observ'd  Light  is convertible into  Bodies  and Bodies into  Light  and that it is probable that  Light  is only the Particles of a  hot  Body thrown off with an immense  Velocity  it would seem that these Particles which constitute Light are the  elementary  Particles of the  second Order  with which  sulphureous  and oily Bodies from the great Activity  Attraction  and  Elasticity  of their Parts appear to be saturated and abound for these being smaller and more  elastic  than the Particles of the  third Order  will be thrown off with a very great  Velocity  which we know to be an essential Property of the  Rays  of  Light  and they will likewise pervade all Bodies which is also a Property belonging to the  Rays of Light    there being no Body however dense or close in its Texture which by being shreded thin does not become transparent  SCHOL II  THE  Rays of Light  seem to consist of Particles of different Sizes that being necessary to produce the various Colours and different Degrees of  Refrangibility  the least of which make  Violet  the weakest and darkest of the Colours and are most easily diverted from the  right  Course by  refracting  Surfaces and the rest as they are bigger make the stronger and more  lucid  Colours as  Blue    Green    Yellow    Red  and are with more and more Difficulty diverted  SCHOL III  THE  Sun  and  fixt Stars  are immense  Globes  of Matter saturated with these Particles of the  second Order  and so being heated  red hot  are kept in Heat by their  intestine  Motion and the  Action  and  Reaction  of their Parts with the  aethereal Fluid  their dense  Atmospheres  by their Compression keeping their Parts from flying off or consuming too fast  SCHOL IV  IT is not impossible that our  Earth  with its  Satellit  the  Moon  the other  Planets  in this our  System  with their  Satellites  but especially  the  Comets  should be all of them  Betteringhouses  according to the  Dutch  manner of speaking  Prisons    Dungeons  and Places of Punishment for  Trial    Expiation  or progressive  Purification  of the several Sorts Orders and Degrees of lapsed  sentient  and  intelligent Beings  That they are not and cannot be  permanent  or  eternal  in their present State  Philosophy  and  Astronomy  furnish innumerable Arguments to convince any thinking Person Most of their  Orbits  are  elliptical  which certainly is not so simple or perfect a Figure as a  Circle  The  Planes  of their  Orbits  cut one another at irregular various and vastly different  Angles  which at least in our present way of thinking is not so  harmonious  Besides the unaccountable  Oddnesses  in most of their  diurnal  and  annual Revolutions  the  Nutations  of their  Axes  their  Rings    Spots  and  Girdles  which at least savour not of that  Simplicity  Perfection and Beauty conspicuous in most of the other Works of the  Author of Nature  Moreover as to our  Planet  in particular it has so many untoward Marks and oblique  Symptoms  of a designed  Deteriority  that it would require a Volume to enumerate those daily observed by  Astronomers  and  natural Philosophers  besides those now mentioned which are common to most of them Our Earth has in particular  barren and unfruitful Climates    unhospitable and uninhabited Regions    unhealthy and mortal Seasons    Tempests    Thunder and Lightning    Vulcanos    Plagues and epidemical or infectious Atmospheres  All which could never proceed from an infinitely good and wise Being if his Design was not to punish and correct But all these seeming Deformities are kind and  fatherly  Designs of Wisdom and have infinitely beautiful  final Causes  and Motives and are strong and amazing Instances of his  Being    Love  and  Wisdom  if they are reckon'd only  Correction  and  Bettering Mansions  of no durable or permanent Stability but verging and growing into some  progressive  beautiful and  final  State by general Laws which  State  in due Time will appear and emerge and then He may as He did at first say of all his Works they were good and perfect in their  Order  And then the  Son  shall give up the Dominion to his  Father  in a much happier and more perfect Condition than it was at first made as  He  said of Himself that  He  came that all God's Creatures  Sentient  and  Intelligent  and consequently their  Habitations  and  Mansions    should have Life  that is have Perfection and Happiness  and have it more abundantly  PROP XX  FLAME  is the  sulphureous  or oily Smoak of a hot Body agitated to such a Degree as to be  ignited  PROP XXI  THOSE Bodies are transparent whose  Pores  are sufficiently small to attract the  Rays of Light  and  rectilinear  to transmit them Thus Paper is made more transparent by having its Pores fill'd or lessen'd with Water or Oil  THE following Propositions are manifest from Experiment  Vide  Boyle  the  Philosophical Transactions  and the  Memoirs  of the  Academy Royal      MERCURY  consists of smaller Particles than any known Fluid for it will pass where no other Fluid can  THE Particles of  Mercury  in all their Divisions preserve a spherical Figure from the strong Attraction of their Parts as is evident by fine Glasses And the smaller the Particles the more perfect the Spheres as the same Glasses demonstrate    MERCURY  is the heaviest of all natural Fluids being times heavier than  Water  THE Particles of  Mercury attract  some Bodies the most of any as  Gold  and fly from  others the most as  Oil of Vitriol  and all  Acids  COROLLARIES  THEREFORE the Particles of  Mercury  are the most easily rais'd by Heat being divisible into the smallest Parts which though not sensible yet are known by their Effects in  Silver Water    Mercurial Steams  and  Exhalations  and their ready passing through all  animal  Substances  THEREFORE the Particles of  Mercury  have the greatest  Momentum  and Force being the heaviest of all natural Fluids  THEREFORE the Particles of  Mercury  by their  Smallness    Sphericity  and  Weight  being actuated and rais'd by Heat readily pervade all animal fleshy Substances which are but  Spunges  with communicating Cells as is evident from the Effects of  Fumigations  and the  Palsies  of those who silver Glass or dig in the Mines of that  Mineral  MEDICAL COROLLARIES  THEREFORE the Particles of  Mercury  are the fittest to break the Cohesion of all  Viscosity  and divide its Substance by its Weight in Animal Tubes from which  Viscosity  all the  cold chronical  Diseases most probably proceed  THEREFORE the Particles of  Mercury  are fittest to open all Obstructions in the small Capillary or  Lymphatic  Vessels from their  Smallness    Weight  and  Sphericity  THEREFORE the Particles of  Mercury  from their  Smallness    Weight  and  Sphericity  are fittest to make the  Circulation  whole and entire quite around  THEREFORE  Mercury  is the only proper  Antidote  for such  Palsies  whose Cause is the  Tenacity  of the Juices in the small BloodVessels pressing upon the  Nerves  and  Fibres  and so interrupting their  Vibrations  and Actions  THEREFORE  Mercury  is the best  Antidote  for the  Scurvy  in the first Intention by its  Smallness  its  Weight  and  Sphericity  breaking the  Salts  and larger Concretions obstructing the  Lymphatics  THEREFORE  Mercury  is also the best  Antidote  for the  Gout  in the first Intention readily opening those small Vessels which are the most difficult to be dilated by reason of their Compression betwixt bony  Articulations  even though their Smallness should be such  that of them can make up but the Thickness or Bulk of one  Hair  But a thin cool  Dyet  must continue them  pervious  when  Mercury  has made them so  THEREFORE  Mercury  duly prepar'd and judiciously manag'd is the only proper  Antidote  for the Diseases produced by Excesses of any kind especially of animal Food and fermented Liquors    MERCURY  by its  Weight  and  Sphericity  will infallibly burst those Vessels whose Obstructions cannot be dissolved or opened driving the Substance of these Obstructions through the Sides of the slender  Lymphatic  Vessels and will infallibly tear the small Vessels whose Sides are very rare and slender or whose Pores are made very large by  Putrefaction  THEREFORE  Mercury  is a divine  Antidote  or  real Poison  according to the Person prescribing or the Case it is prescribed in  THE best Preparation of  Mercury  is that wherein its Particles are most minutely divided and kept at the greatest Distance from one another  THAT Preparation of  Mercury  is the best where after a due Division into its smallest  Parts the Mixture is made with  that  Body which has the most  specific  Virtue against the Disease Thus the  Aethiops cum Sulph  is best for  Inflammations    Piles  the  Gout  the  Erysipelas    c  and that with  Antimony  against  cutaneous  Distempers that with  Volatiles  and  Foetids  in  Nervous  Cases that with  Bark  and  Bitters  in  Intermittents  and so in others  THEREFORE the  Aqua Mercurialis  is the very safest general Deobstruent in very weak Persons did it not require too long time to produce any salutary Effect  Mercury alcalisated  or kill'd with any calcin'd Body given often and in small Doses is the next  Cinnabar next  to that and then  Aethiops    c  ALL  Mineral  Medicines ought to be infinitely divided before they are sent into an Animal Body they never having been intended by the  Author of Nature  to enter there but in their  minutest  Particles and Divisions as we may see by  Nature  's preparing in this Manner  Mineral  Waters of all kinds fitted for the Cure of almost all  chronical  Diseases if join'd with a proper Regimen except perhaps some few of those begot by unnatural cramming with Mixtures of Salts Spices Oils and inflammable Spirits  or those begot by contagious venereal Diseases    MERCURY  with the Salts such as  Calomel  the  Turbith    Sublimat    red    white  and  green Precipitate  are of all Preparations the most prejudicial and injurious to animal Habits these saline Mixtures tearing the small Vessels where Diseases are mostly generated and in whose Integrity all the Delicacy of Life consists But they are thereby of the quickest Effect in Cases that depend on Expedition as the  Hydrophobia  inflammatory  Rheumatism  and the like  GENERAL MEDICAL COROLLARIES  As  Water  alone  Bloodwarm  is the best Diluent so  Mercury  is the best  Deobstruent  but as  Water  alone may be too sluggish so  Mercury  alone may be too active and ponderous for tender and delicate  Animal  Solids especially in its fluid State or mix'd with  Salts  or too active Bodies and therefore the absolutely best Preparation of  Mercury  is when being divided by the utmost possible Art it is join'd with the most  specific vegetable  Medicines against the Distemper that it can conveniently be united with and fixt in  As the  Fineness  or  Smallness  of Particles together with the Largeness of their Surfaces make  Hardness  or the greatest  Cohesion  in Bodies as has been shewn by Proposition IV and V and may be seen in finewoven  Cloth    Gold    Marble    Crystal    Shells    Salts  and  Diamonds  and as  Earths    Water    Milk    watery Fluids  and  vegetable Substances  consist mostly of Water and rare loose fine Earths with a little grosser  Salts  and  Sulphurs  of small or no Cohesion it is evident that such Substances are fittest for weak  tender  and  valetudinary  Persons as affording all the Materials of  Nutrition  and being more easily resolvible into their  integral  Particles and are most proper Food for intellectual Purposes which depend on the easy Performance of the  animal Functions  as  nervous  Distempers arise chiefly from their labour'd Performance compressing by their Weight and Hardness the too tender and delicate membranous  Tubuli  of the  Nerves  and so stopping or retarding their  Vibrations  and  Oscillations  tho' they are not so proper for  mechanical  Strength and Force  GENERAL SCHOLIUM  IN these few Propositions are contain'd the Principles of all the natural  Philosophy  hinted at in my medical Treatises If it is just or  approaches the Truth as I hope it does then it must necessarily follow That soft mild and cool Foods are fittest to carry on the  animal Functions  the most readily freely naturally and lastingly That  Spirits    Salts    chymical Oils  which are but Spirits condens'd and every thing that has pass'd the  Tortures  of the  Fire  abounding with Particles small hard  caustic  for calcin'd  Antimony  will be increas'd one fifth in its Weight and highly  attractive  are most pernicious to  animal  Habits not only burning and tearing the delicate  Fibres  and Vessels like  Caustics  and  Lancets  but by their  attractive  Powers violently corrugating and contracting the  Fibres  so that in habitual Drinkers Drammers and high Feeders their  Tone  and  Elasticity  is entirely destroy'd by their sudden and alternate  Contractions  and  Relaxations  Vide  Hales's Haemostaticks  while at the same time the Juices are thicken'd and coagulated by the spirituous Mixture and so dispos'd to form  Obstructions  and  Concretions  in the smaller Vessels And therefore they ought never to be used but as  Spurs  and  Whips  to push on and stimulat the sluggish  Organs  for a time and make them carry off the Overload with a short Vigour and so are only proper in Extremities as a present Filip That  animal  Foods whose Parts have been first divided  by  animal Organs  and afterwards attenuated and refin'd by those of other  Animals  and mixed with great Quantities of  animal  Salts and Oils when again taken into  animal  Habits for Food where they undergo a third Subtilization or  Milling  or the Flesh of  Animals  that live on  animal  Food are so minutely divided as by Proposition IV to acquire the greatest Degree of  Attraction  and therefore when introduc'd into the small  Tubes  and capillary Vessels in great Quantities they must form  Obstructions  of the strongest Cohesion and Tenacity That  Mercury  in some Shape or other is the only proper Deobstruent and Dissolvent in all  chronical  Cases and in those  acute  ones that come nearest to them especially in those who have fed much and long on  animal  Foods and  fermented  or  distill'd  Liquors That  Milk  and  Vegetables  are not only the sole rational and proper Food of tender or diseased  Animals  but from the Grossness of their Parts and their small Degree of  Attraction  and Cohesion consequent thereupon being dissolv'd by a less Force than  animal  Food are fittest to carry on the most pleasantly all the  Functions  in which  Health    Serenity  and  free Spirits  consist That therefore  Milk    Seeds    Fruits  and  mealy  Vegetables with Waterdrinking are undoubtedly the most infallible Means to preserve the  Faculties clear  and  acute  and to acquire  Activity  and long  Life  whatever  mechanical  Force and Strength may require for sudden strong Efforts On the whole as  Water  with a little fine vegetable  Earth    Salt  and  Sulphur  seems to me to be the  proper  Food intended by  Nature  for  Animals  and as it is  Water  alone which conciliats that  Fluidity  absolutely necessary to Juices circulating in  Tubes  the more it partakes of this  Element  the fitter it is for the  animal  Functions  Mercury  seems to be the only other Fluid that has the Qualities fitted for circulating and destroying  Viscosity  so that in fine the two proper  Antidotes  intended by Nature for chronical animal Diseases especially those of the worst Kind seem to be  Mercury  somehow prepared and  Water  naturally or artificially impregnated the one for animal and the other for  vegetable  Feeders  DISCOURSE IV Philosophical CONJECTURES ON SPIRITUAL NATURE THE HUMAN SPIRIT in Particular  Gen i  And God said Let us make Man in our Image after our Likeness  Ver  So God created Man in his own Image in the Image of God created He him  DISCOURSE IV  Philosophical CONJECTURES ON SPIRITUAL NATURE THE HUMAN SPIRIT in Particular  § THE  natural Faculties  Properties or Attributes of all rational  Spirits  and human Intelligences and indeed of all Intelligences of whatsoever  Order  or  Degree  are incontestably these three  Perception  or Understanding  Willing  Chusing or Freedom  Memory  Reflection or Attention Out of these  three  all the Operations of a human  Spirit  may be deduced and suppose  living  or actuating some  Vehicle  as their  Base  and though they may be and are justly considered separately yet in wellexercised and duly cultivated  Spirits  they are sometimes so instantaneous as to seem one and the same Act of the  Mind  and are called by  the general Name of Thinking or  Cogitation  when either in separate  Acts  or instantaneous and all Spirits differ chiefly in the Degrees of these  natural Powers  § HOWEVER uncommon the Expression may seem yet to those who admit a  Deity  or supreme  Spirit  of infinite Perfection the  Author  and first  Cause  of all Things finite  Spirits  of all possible  Orders  can be conceived  philosophically  no otherwise than as  Miniatures    Effluxes    Emanations    Infinitesimals  or infinitely small  Sparkles  of this infinite Source of  Living    Intelligence    Action    Perfection  and  Happiness  voluntarily emitted lighted up or  created  by this infinitely perfect  Being  and endow'd with his  radical  and  essential  Qualities and Attributes of  Life    Activity  and  Intelligence  so that all  Spirits  are in their own Natures diminutive or infinitely small  Deities  and necessarily now they are created and have a derivative Existence from Him must partake of his  Immortality    Intelligence  and  Freedom  or his  Divine Nature  and  Image  and consequently can never be  annihilated  forced or deprived of the Powers of  Perception    Intelligence  and  Willing  no more  He  can  § THESE  Faculties  and Powers of all  Spirits  are not only to be  felt  but distinguished in every  human  Mind duly exercised  and cultivated by  attentively  considering its Nature and Operations but necessarily follow by  Analogy  from the Nature of the  first  Cause that Being of infinite Perfection the  Deity  who being of infinite  Wisdom  and  Power  could find nothing without  Himself  before Creation to be a  Model  or  Pattern  for his intelligent Creatures and therefore stamp'd them with his own most  glorious Image  creating them little  Divinities  resembling Himself in his  radical  and  essential  Attributes so as at last to become  similar  to Him in Perfection and Happiness in their several  Orders    Gradations  and  Ranks  For  infinite  Perfection wanting nothing and to whom no Happiness nor Perfection could be  added  could have no other  End  or  View  in producing rational  Intelligences  into  Being  but to make them happy by partaking of his  essential  Happiness in their several  Orders  and  Ranks  that is in becoming  similar  to him in his  natural  as well as  moral  Attributes his natural ones as has been said being  Life    Intelligence  and  Activity  his  moral  ones  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  in which  two  united consists the Perfection and Happiness of all  intelligent  Creatures  § IN a mere  Philosophical  Disquisition though no Argument is to be taken from  Revelation  yet to express my Meaning so as to leave no room to be mistaken by such to whom  Revelation  is familiar I shall represent it in the Words of the Scriptures It is said in  Genesis  on the Design of the  Creation  of the  human Soul    Let us make Man after our own Image  and again  in the Image of God created he him  and elsewhere  You are God  's  Images  And to shew the human  Rank    David  says  He was created a little lower than the Angels  and our  Saviour  speaking of  Marriage  says that in Heaven  they are neither married    nor given in Marriage    but are like the Angels  and the same Manner of describing the human  Spirit  frequently occurs in the  Scriptures  both of the  old  and  new Testament  § IT is a frequent and common Opinion of all  Pagan  and  Christian  Antiquity that all created Intelligences have Bodies or  Vehicles  of one kind or another fitted to their  Order    Rank  Degree of  Purity    Habitation  and  Situation  It is highly probable and  philosophical  to think there is no perfectly  pure  and immaterial  Spirit  but the  Supreme Spirit  the  Father  and  Creator  of all Spirits and that all created  Spirits  how high and sublime soever have proper and peculiar Bodies and  organiz'd  Cases not only to circumscribe and limit their  Powers  and their  Extension  and  Expansion  but to enable them to communicat and commerciat with to contemplat and admire the Contrivance of the  material  World  to converse with the lower Ranks of Intelligences that we certainly know have material  Vehicles  such as we of the  human  Race are but also to execute the Orders of the Divine  Oeconomy  and Providence over the whole  System  of Intelligences and material World And accordingly we find Mention made in  holy Writ  of a  natural  Body and a  spiritual  Body and of the  Sun  and  Planets  having a particular  Glory  in their Bodies peculiar to themselves and of the  glorious  Appearance and  Radiation  of our  Saviour  's Body on the  Mount  And it is very absurd and almost  blasphemous  to think these  Myriads  of  Stars  and Luminaries that appear in a Winter Night in the Heavens and its  milky Way  to be nothing but twinkling  Tapers  uninhabited and designed only to be stupidly and ignorantly  gaz'd  on by us  § WHAT a  spiritual  Substance or of what Nature the  Substratum  of these Faculties of  Understanding  and  Will  or of  Thinking  is we shall never perfectly know till we arrive at the World of  Spirits  and drop this coarse  earthly  Tabernacle Indeed we know nothing of the internal  Substance  of any Being all we know or can know is their sensible Qualities and the  Effects  of them on us and something in general we learn of inanimated Bodies and their  Laws  from the  Uniformity  of these Effects And we may be certain that  spiritual  Substance is in most if not all its Qualities contradictory at least  contrary  to Body or  material  Substance and  vice versâ  For  Example  we know that Matter is absolutely  passive  and equally susceptible of  Motion  or  Rest  and that  Spirit  or spiritual Substances are  selfactive  and  selfmotive  and the immediate productive Cause of all Motion in Body and consequently is endow'd with  Freedom  or  Liberty  We know that  Matter  is  impenetrable  and that two Bodies cannot possess the same  Space  at the same  time  but  Spirits  may and can pervade and penetrat one another at least by their  spiritual  Virtue and  Energy  as is evident from  Persuasion    Conviction    Reasoning  and  Compassion  and suchlike spiritual Actions It is true the  Sphere  of their  Activities  is limited and circumscribed but we also know that the  Spirit  acts in every Point of that  Circumscription  as we find by our Bodies every Part of which is more or less sensible by the  membranous  Mouths of the nervous  Tubuli  being spread over all the solid Parts of an  animal Body  and we know no  Body  or mere Matter that is so  Matter  is certainly divisible in  infinitum  and may be actually divided into very small Parts but  Spirit  having no sensible Parts is neither  divisible  nor  discerptible  Persons of light Understandings and gross Conceptions may dispute or ridicule these Truths but they must be  poor Philosophers  who can think them not highly  probable  and have a mean Notion of the Extent of Nature and its  Author  Four  of the greatest  Philosophers  of this or any other Age to wit Sir  Isaac Newton  Mr  Leibneitz  Mr  Hugens  and Mr  Fatio  when they describe the  Matter  which they suppose to be the Cause of  Gravity  consider it as  infinitely  small in its Particles  infinitely  rare  infinitely  elastic and moved with an  infinite  Velocity And the  first  of these by a very strong Figure calls it  Spiritus quidam Subtilissimus  What these  four Infinitudes  may effect on  Matter  to destroy at least these gross palpable and sensible Qualities we observe in it such as sensible  Extension    Impenetrability  and  Passivity  I will not take upon me to determine But all the Notion we can now form of  Spirit  is to  divide    refine    sublime  and  exalt  Body and Matter  ad infinitum  so that we be sure it can have very little of the  sensible  Qualities and this I fear is as far as  Philosophy  can go while we have only gross and palpable  Vehicles  of Clay For by  Analogy  to infinitely divided subtiliz'd sublim'd and refin'd  material  substance we form the only Idea Notion or Perception we can now frame of  spiritual  Substances and that is but a gross one and neither just nor true  §  LIVING    Sensation  or  Actuation  of Matter is not easy to define or describe  Existence  or Being belongs to  Matter  as well as  Spirit  but  Life  Sensation or Perception and their Consequences belong only to some one  Rank  of Spirit or Mind and I may defy all  the  Philosophers  and  Mathematicians  that ever have been to explain consistently from  Matter  and  Mechanism  alone as it now obtains the  Life    Growth  and  Fecundity  of the lowest  Plant  or  Vegetable  at least its  Seed  or  Seeding  much less of the least  Insect  or  Animal  and least of all of a  rational    sentient  and  percipient  Being So that whereever there is any  Degree  of  Life    Vegetative    Sensitive  or  Rational  there is probably some Degree of a  Soul  or  Spirit    immaterial    immortal  and  progressive  so that  Life  or Animation in all Creatures in general is indeed Matter  organiz'd  and actuated by a  Spirit  or  Soul  of some one  Rank  or  Degree  or other I mean only created Life or Life  derivative  as it is in Creatures for in the  Creator  Life is without  Matter  without  Body  or  Vehicle  and without  Limits  or Possibility of Nonexistence or not Living The best Notion Idea or Perception we can frame of created Life is that of a nice delicate finely contriv'd  Machine  of a vast Variety of  Organs  set in Motion by the  first Cause  and continued by an internal selfmotive  Spring  which  Spring  is this  spiritual  Substance  § As we have some Notion of what Extent the bestform'd and most cultivated human  Spirit  is there may be  Myriads  of a lower Rank of the same  Species  and that as under the human  Species  there is an almost  infinite Variety of the  brutal  and irrational  Species  and under these a like or greater Variety of the  vegetable  Kind from the Moss on the  Wall  and the  coralline Seaplant  up to the highest  Divine    Philosopher  or  Mathematician  of the human Race and that all the several  Species  from the highest to the lowest sink so gradually into one another that it is impossible to determine where one  Degree  ends or the next begins So it is also highly probable that above the  human  Species there are  Orders    Ranks  and  Hierarchies  rising gradually and insensibly without  Limits  and without  End  This the Dignity Power Wisdom and Goodness of the  first  infinitely perfect Being and the  Analogy  of Things seem to oblige us to  conjecture  or hope and the infinite Variety of  Systems    Fixt Stars  which we known to be  Suns  and very probably have  primary  and  secondary Planets    analogous  to ours and the infinite Expansion of  Space  makes it probable and  philosophical  And as an  Angel  is only of a little higher and more noble Order than the  human  Race and all created Intelligences have  Vehicles  or Bodies of an  Order  and  Purity analogous  to their  Rank  and  Degree  in the  Scale  of Intelligences we may fairly and  philosophically  define a pure original not  lapsed    Angel  of the lowest  Order  a  spiritual  Substance of the next immediat Order above the  Human  actuating a divinely  organiz'd  Body of a Purity  and Sublimity  analogous  to their Order and the Perfection of his informing Spirit  § WE have a pretty clear Perception of what the human Race is at present both in their Body and Spirit He that has a just though not an adequate Idea of  infinite  Perfection that is of  infinite  Power Wisdom and Goodness can find no possible Reason or Motive why such a  Being  should create Intelligences imperfect in their  Order  unhappy and perishing when the  same  Power Wisdom and Goodness could either have totally abstain'd from creating  them  at all or have made them to be at last happy in their  Order  and  Rank  consistent with their Natures and his own  Malice  and  Difficulty  having no Place in such a  Being  But any one who considers this ruinous disorder'd  Globe  and the Miseries Darkness and Wretchedness of the whole  System  of Intelligences that inhabit it cannot but conclude one of these  two  either that their  Author  had not Power to make them otherwise or that they have wilfully forfeited their  Rank  and his Favour and Protection by transgressing the Terms and Conditions on which they were intitled to it and so being left to reap the Fruits of their own Labour sunk into a  lapsed  disorderly Condition  §  INFINITE  Power Wisdom and Goodness could primarily and originally bring no Intelligence into Being with rational and intelligent  Spirits  actuating divinely  organiz'd  Bodies or Vehicles but under these  two  Conditions That the  organiz'd  Body should be supple pliable and joyfully obedient to all the  Dictates  and Commands of the free intelligent  Spirit  And That the  Spirit  should be supple pliable and obedient to the  Dictates  and Influences of the  Eternal  and  infinitely  perfect  Spirit  its  Author  and  Creator  And in these  two  its  original  Innocence Happiness and Perfection must necessarily have consisted And this was and must have been the true  original  and  paradisaical  State of both Body and Soul of the human Race and must be the Constitution and Complexion of the  unfallen angelical  State and of all the  Hierarchies  of unlapsed  Spirits  Which  two  Conditions I think necessarily infer a  preexistent  State to our present one since we do not find them in ourselves now  § ALL created Intelligences being  free  and finite must of Consequence be  fallible  and liable to run into  Disorder  as well as capable of obeying  Order  For they could not be  free  unless they had the Power of chusing either Side Selfactivity being of the  Essence  and Root of  Intelligence  and perhaps the Source  from which it springs so that all created  finite free  Intelligences were naturally capable of Falling of Rebellion and Disorder An  infinitely  wise and intelligent Being of sufficient Power could not make another intelligent  Being  with Desires Impressions and  Pantings  after a State which was according to Order to his Nature and the Nature of Things unless at the same time  He  had appointed Means and proper Objects to satisfy these just and natural  Desires  no beneficent and good Being could act so Now that we at least many of us of the  human  Race have yet a Notion and  Idea  of a better State of Being and Acting than we find ourselves in and wish and pant after it is most certain and undeniable every honest and thinking Person must find  a Law in his Members    that wars against the Law of his Mind  and wishes and desires to be freed from the one that he may conform to the other Now this is what is called the  Lapse  or Fall and if this State of Imperfection last for ever so must the  Fall  and till this Desire or Panting be satisfied the intelligent Creature cannot be completely happy and for this End was the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  intended  § How and by what  Steps  the  Lapse  was brought on is of no Consequence for us precisely to know The  Design  and Point in  View  of all the  Oeconomy  of Providence and  of  Jesus  is to restore us with the Consent Concurrence and Integrity of our three  radical  Attributes of  Living    Activity  or Freedom and  Intelligence  which He cannot do Violence to they being immediately derived from Himself whose  Images  and  Miniatures  all Intelligences are And the Means that alone can effect this without intrenching upon these essential and radical Qualities are  pure Love    naked Faith  and  universal Resignation  which Means we could not perfectly use if  precise  Truths particular and specific  Steps  and the naked Nature of Things were always pointed out to us This at first at least would infallibly weaken our  Faith  and  Trust  counteract our  Resignation  and destroy our  Liberty  and therefore all that is reveal'd concerning  this  and the other Truths of past future and invisible  States  is general undetermin'd and indefinite and the  Precision  is promis'd only on our Advancement and Progress  He that doth the Will of my Father    shall know of the Doctrine  Our  first  Lesson is just what is absolutely necessary to begin our Return the Knowledge of more Truths and greater  Precision  is to reward our Progress The next immediate Step or what is to be done daily and hourly we are never ignorant of in our Duty and that is all that is necessary the rest are all wisely put out of our Reach and do not belong to us now till we advance that Step and when we  come into the proper Disposition of Body and Mind to benefit by the just and precise Knowledge of these mentioned and suchlike Divine Truths though absolute  Precision  be inconsistent with  Finitude  we shall admire and adore the Wisdom of our  Teacher  for having conceal'd from us what would then have hurt us as much as for these  general  Truths which serve sufficiently to  animate  and encourage us in our now travelling and  probatory  State for both are directed with  equal  Wisdom If we are ignorant it is because we are not come into the proper Disposition to benefit by Knowledge or that more precise Knowledge would hurt us and draw us out of our  Orbit  or shortest Road  § IF we may be allow'd to conjecture with Humility and Modesty about such unreveal'd and indefinite  Truths  and  States  we may reasonably think that this  Lapse  was not brought about all at once but  Step  by  Step  by many  Machinations  Plots and Contrivances of the superior  lapsed Intelligences  on the Inferior  Nemo repente fit optimus aut turpissimus  Finite Intelligences must form and acquire all their  Habits  by repeated  Acts  and  Step  by  Step  So that in all Probability the  Fall  might have been a long time in bringing about and innumerable Numbers of all the several  Ranks  and  Orders  and some of all the different  Hierarchies  might have been  brought into this  general Rebellion  and have gradually departed from that  pure Love    naked Faith  and  universal Resignation  which alone made the Essence of their Perfection and Happiness though in the  brief  contracted Account we have of it in  Revelation  it is compriz'd in a few general Words which is all we in our present  State  it seems could bear without Violence being committed on our  Liberties  our universal  Resignation  obstructed and the Merit of  pure Love  and a generous Trust and Confidence in infinite Perfection destroy'd more explicit and detail'd Accounts might have nourished  Pride    Presumption  and  Selfsufficiency  and so sunk us deeper  § OUR  Senses  were given us to  commerciat  with material Objects and to perceive and enjoy the Beauties of the  inanimate  Creation as well as to limit the  Extension  and  Expansion  of our Powers and Faculties and by them all our Sensations  Ideas  and Pictures of Bodies and inanimate Creatures are convey'd to the  sentient  and  intelligent  Principle The Key and Mean of all our  natural  Knowledge of them is  Experiment  or Observation perform'd by our Senses simply or improv'd by  Art  and the  Logic  of all human and natural Knowledge about them is  Proportion  justly apply'd For  Syllogism  and formal Argument is but  Proportion  express'd in abstracted Terms or the  Ideas  meant by these  Terms and this is the true and only Mean of natural Knowledge about  Bodies  and their natural Qualities and  Laws  In  spiritual  Truths imperceptible and immaterial  Beings    viz  about their Nature Qualities and Ranks can know nothing naturally and humanly unless it be infus'd and impress'd by some other  Spirit  but by  Analogy    Similitude    Allegory    Trope    Metaphor  or  Figure  referring them to and comparing them with our own intelligent and sentient  Spirit  and its Manner of Operation and then cloathing them with such Terms or referring them to such Knowledge as we have receiv'd from  Sensation  or from  Proportion  and this is the only  Mean  and Instrument of human Knowledge we can possibly have in the Nature Qualities and  moral  Relations of  Spirits    spiritual  and  moral  Actions and Duties The  sentient  and  intelligent  Principle or  Soul  is the Spring or Source of both  Keys  or Kinds of  Logic  without which both would be equally useless Culture and Experience is in  spiritual  Knowledge what  Experiment  and Observation is in  sensitive  Knowledge  Analogy  is to the  first  what  Proportion  is to the  second    Similitude    Allegory    Trope    Metaphor  and  Figure  all the Appendages of  Analogy  or a more distant or near Approximation to it are what a more or less accurate a general or more particular  Experiment  and Observation or juster and clearer  Proportion  apply'd to material Objects is in  sensitive  Knowledge and a close simple full and cogent  Analogy  is as just and coercive a Demonstration in  spiritual  Knowledge as a  Mathematical  or  Geometrical  one is in  sensitive  Knowledge  Scripture    Revelation  and our own inward  Feelings  of the Operations of our  Soul  give the  Data    viz  the general Propositions the accurate Observations on them  analogous  to Mr  Flamstead  's or Dr  Halley  's Observations of the  Appulses  of the Moon to the Fixed Stars from sufficient Numbers of which the great Orbit of the Lunar Revolution is determin'd by comparing them with the general  Law  of Attraction Here  Revelation  gives us the  Observations  the Knowledge we have of the Nature of the Operations of our own  Spirits  gives us the general  Law  and  Analogy  may answer to  Algebra  and  Calculation  in  Astronomy  and mix'd  Mathematics  and we may err and blunder in the  first  for want of Care and Attention as we may in the  last  being ever finite and consequently fallible  § THE Account we have in  Revelation  of the  Lapse  may have a  literal    natural  and material Meaning as all the Words and Works of  God  have a  natural  or  literal    spiritual  and  divine  Meaning and Use else he were not  God  that is a Being of  infinite  Perfection and these Meanings may only  develope  and unfold themselves and appear to different Persons according to their different Degrees of  Purity  and Perfection the  literal  and  cortical  Meaning and Use may be fitted to  elementary  and initiating Persons and be  just  and  true  in its Degree and the  others  proper only for the more advanced and this with infinite Variety Justness and Property Now in  Moses  's Account of the  Lapse  the  Tree of Life  of the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  the  Serpent    Paradise  and all the  Scene  and  Group  of this mysterious Affair was certainly  literal    material  and  real  as there represented and described but perhaps happen'd not till the last Act of this  Tragedy Paradise  was certainly a most delicious and enchanting Place of  material  and bodily Delights the  Tree of Life  and its Fruit was design'd to perpetuat the Life and Health of the then newmodell'd though not perhaps  Ethereal  Vehicle the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil  certainly communicated by its Fruit Pain Diseases and Death to this partially incrusted Body The  Serpent  no Doubt was a lapsed  Spirit  embodied in this then more  beautiful Animal  Now as all this Scene may have also  spiritual  Meaning as well as a  literal  and elementary one of more Consequence to our Happiness and Perfection to be known and believ'd as the  Spirit  is of more Value than the  Body  why may not  Paradise  mean in this Sense the  three  original and fundamental Powers of  the Soul  Living    Activity  or Liberty and  Intelligence  or its original and immutable Nature and Constitution intrusted with us finite Intelligences to cultivate improve and exalt The  Tree of Life  be  Him  from whom all Life and Being proceeds the  Father  of us all The  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil  the primary  Image  of the  Deity  the  Son of God  by whose  Oeconomy  Evil known and felt could only be done away and eraz'd or his divine Nature Justice Goodness and Truth which  Image  was in the human Nature defac'd by trusting it to his own  Spirit  and Liberty The  Serpent  the  grand Deceiver  or  lapsed  spiritual Nature in General or one of the highest  Order  of the  lapsed Hierarchy  And so the whole Scene of the  Lapse  may be more properly and feelingly  allegoriz'd  or explain'd in plain Terms to an honest and ingenuous Heart  viz  thus All created finite Intelligences being  free  and consequently  fallible  innumerable Numbers of them through  Pride    Selfsufficiency  and Desire of  Independence  trusting to and conducting themselves by their own  natural  Lights as being made little  Deities  and deriveing with their Being from their Author a  Ray  Efflux or  infinitesimal  Emanation of his  Selfexistence    infinite Activity  or Power and infinite Wisdom that is of his Nature and essential Attributes deriving I say  dependent  and  derivative  Living Freedom and Intelligence  but affecting Independency and departing from  pure Love    naked Faith  and  universal Resignation  to infinite Perfection they gradually sunk into  Selfishness    Propriety  and  inordinate Love  of the Creatures and instead of being govern'd absolutely in all things by the Providence Influences Impulses and Suggestions of the  Eternal Spirit  they affected to be govern'd by their own natural Spirits and selfish and narrow Views and Prejudices and became as it were  independent  unguarded and unrestrain'd  Thinkers  and  Actors  prying into and determining in all Matters whatsoever and instead of being resign'd to the  universal Reason  and sovereign  Will  and Order of Divine Providence found Fault with criticis'd grumbled at and blasphem'd the Conduct and  Oeconomy  of infinite Wisdom and gradually departed from  pure Love    naked Faith  and  Trust  and  universal Resignation  the  sole  Means to preserve them in the Perfection of their dependent State and in  Similarity  to his  moral Attributes  and so fell from the perfect Happiness of their Rank and derivative Being  Self  spurious  Self  became  transubstantiated  into their thus deprav'd Natures  § WHEN human Nature had thus  lapsed  by affecting Independence and desireing to govern itself by its own natural Spirit solely and wallowing in the Objects of Sense and swallow'd in  Creaturepleasures  it being  an  eternal Law  establish'd in Nature for many wise and great Ends and by  Analogy  as we find it extending from  material  to  spiritual  Things  viz  that  Like draws and is equally drawn to Like  or that Bodies and Spirits attract and unite with  similar Bodies  and  Spirits  from the universal Principle of  Attraction  and  Union  the human Body did hence necessarily and  mechanically  as it were contract a Rust Grossness  Stupor  and Inactivity and became restive and disobedient to the Commands of the natural  Spirit  gradually degenerating into an  earthly    gross    material  Prison or  Dungeon  and the  Spirit  was hereby more contracted restrain'd and limited in its original and immutable Attributes of  Liveing    Activity  and  Intelligence  as to their Extention Purity the Quickness and Exertion of their Acts for all Spirits are limited and tied down to the  Nature    Order  and  Purity  of their  Vehicles  while their Union lasts though their natural Powers in their  Fund  and Essence be immutable and constantly the same so that their natural Spirits now being assisted by the  supernatural Grace  and Influence of the  Eternal Spirit  procur'd by the Mediation of  Jesus  must work out their Recovery and Restoration by gradually returning to their  original Order  § PERHAPS as all animated Beings  Sentient  or  Intelligent  must necessarily be  cloath'd with some  Vehicle  purer or grosser  ethereal  or  planetary  fitted to the  Mansion  they are confin'd to and to their Degree of Purity in their moral Powers and their Extention or Rank of natural Powers so all  created free Intelligences  of whatever Order or Degree must necessarily pass through some State of  Probation  Apprenticeship and Trials of their  Love    Faith  and  Patience  before they can arrive at their  final  immutable and for ever  permanent  State and the  Mansion  they are eternally to inhabit afterwards That something like this was the general Sense of Mankind seems to be hinted in all  Pagan  Antiquity that we have any Accounts of  Egyptian    Syrian    Grecian  and  Roman  by their  Initiations  into the  Mysteries  of their  Gods  and this chiefly in order to produce an habitual Firmness Force and Stability on finite free labile Intelligences in the different Institutions It would seem as none but  God  is a pure  Spirit  in his Nature and Substance none but  God  can be  infallible  and  impeccable  And that all Creatures being finite and  free  must necessarily by their Nature be  labile    fallible  and  peccable  and that even infinite  Wisdom  and  Power  could not make a  Creature  for  God  cannot work Contradictions that was of its own Nature  illabile    infallible  and  impeccable  but that before that  secondary  Nature of eternal  Infallibility    Illability  and  Impeccability  could be brought about on the  most perfect of created Intelligences it must necessarily be by confirm'd  Habits  produced by repeated  Acts  and perfected into  pure Love  and  naked Faith  or into an absolute Surrendry of their  natural  and  moral Powers  to infinite Perfection which alone can produce derivative  Infallibility  and  Illability  on them and so  eternize  Perfection and Happiness and which only can be produced by various Trials Essays and Temptations to the contrary  He who never was tempted    what knoweth he  Thus the  Son  of  God  as  Man  was made  perfect  by Suffering As a  Potter  gives Firmness and Impenetrability to his  Earthen Ware  by keeping it in the Fire till it vitrifies Had  Lucretia  lived to all Eternity her  Chastity  would never have been doubted whereas  Cleopatra  must not only first have made an  Amende Honorable  but have pass'd through several severe new  Trials  before her's could have been believ'd We plainly find by  Revelation  that many of all the several  Hierarchies  fell on their  Trial  for tried they must have been else they could not have  fallen  for  Reaction  always supposes  Action  As it is the Nature of  Pride  and  Malice  to be spiteful infectious and tempting in Hopes that Numbers may make them overlook'd or too powerful and so secure we find they or their Leader suppose his Name  Lucifer  had a great hand in the human  Lapse  as it is glanced at under the  Serpent  that tempted  Eve  And from this  Fall  of the  Angels  the natural and plain Account of  Daemonology  and the early impious  Heresy  of the  Manichaeans    Lucifer  and his  Angels  is to be deriv'd What the  Trials  of these  fallen Angels  were and in what manner those of the Angels in the several  Hierarchies  who stood combated kept firm and unshaken and thereby were for ever confirm'd  establish'd  and  eterniz'd  and perhaps increas'd and inlarg'd in  Purity    Lustre  and  Glory  by their Victory is not reveal'd nor to be discover'd but by  Analogy  or Conjecture The  History  of the human  Lapse  is so brief and obscure in  Moses  perhaps partly  allegorical  partly  literal  with a plain Design to damp idle or hurtful  Curiosity  and so prevent our being hurt thereby by withdrawing us from the  one thing necessary  that it amounts almost to a total  Forbidding  and a Warning from prying with too much Eagerness into this  mysterious  Affair and to leave things secret the  Secreta Imperii Divini  to  God  All that is certain is that we are  lapsed  at present or in a State of Trial and Probation we of the  human  Race on this ruinous  Planet  and cannot possibly now be as we came out of the Hands of our infinitely wise good and powerful  Creator Preexistence  the Manner of our  Lapse  the Duration of our Banishment and the last Term and Limits of our  Restoration  are with  infinite  Wisdom and Goodness in their Detail conceal'd  from us because they would infallibly  hurt  us if more  precise  they might obstruct the Merit of  Faith  or draw us out of the shortest Way  Either  of these two Manners of explaining the  Lapse  may suffice an honest modest  Philosopher  who is sensible of his own limited Faculties to make the Affair neither improbable nor impossible especially when he finds himself both imperfect unhappy and unfit to be finally united with a  Being  infinitely perfect and happy as He now is I chuse the  first  as more conformable to  Revelation  and the Form of  sound Words  and every modest  Christian Philosopher  will be cautious  not to be wise    above what is written  § WHETHER this  Globe  of  Earth  as we now inhabit it was the  original  and  primitive  Seat of  innocent  and  unlapsed  human  Spirits  and by the  Energy  and Force of the  Lapse  was gradually and necessarily and according to the present Laws of Bodies turn'd into the ruinous dark dismal State it is now in and such elementary and clayey Prisons made of it as our present  Vehicles  and the human  Race  with all the Spirits concern'd in the  Rebellion  thrust down and confin'd upon it is not material to be known nor perhaps  philosophically  to be determin'd It seems most probable and conformable to the  Analogy  of Things and the common  Laws  of  Nature that it gradually and naturally changed from its  original  Beauty and superior Place among the  Stars  into its present ruinous and decay'd  State  from the natural  Malignity  and deleterious  Energy  of the  Rebellion  in its primitive Inhabitants which perhaps was gradual What is certain is that such a Place as  Paradise  is describ'd is now nowhere to be found on it and that  balancing  the Inconveniencies with the Advantages of want of  Light  and  Sun  and of cold uncertain and various  Seasons  of  Barrenness  and Mountains cover'd with  Ice  and  Snow  of the one Part with the  Hurricanes    Tempests    Volcano's    Earthquakes    Thunder  and  Lightning  poisonous  Insects  and ravenous and savage  Beasts  scorching Heats and  pestilential  Winds Blasts or Damps of the other the whole  Globe  is pretty near equal in Conveniencies and no particular Place without its  Comforts  and  Inconveniencies  So that either  Paradise  was on some other  Planet  or which is most natural to suppose Crime  Rebellion  and Disorder have had a  physical  and necessary Influence on the Matter or Vehicle belonging to each human  Spirit  and thus the whole Mass of rebellious  Intelligences  with the  Globe  they inhabited was naturally and  physically  chang'd and disorder'd I say it is most natural and  philosophical  and perhaps a necessary Consequence of  physical  Efficiency and  Energy  to conclude that the  Spirit  according to its  Degree of Purity or Depravity should purify and sublime or corrupt and disorder the  elementary  Vehicle with which it is cloathed as  Fire  turns Bodies into its own Nature and  Cold  deadens and incrassats them according to the Degree of their Intenseness We see  Luxury  inordinat  Leachery  Riot and Laziness first incrassat then inflame and at last  mortify  and  putrify  human and animal Bodies and Abstinence a low and cool  Regimen  Exercise and Air  lighten  enliven and  volatilize  them And it is not impossible that a whole Race and all the Inhabitant Mass of such corrupted and putrified Bodies and deprav'd and degenerated  Spirits  may have had such an insensible and gradual Influence on a whole  Globe  its  Atmosphere  and different Regions as quite to alter its  original  Nature as we see Heaps of putrifying  Fish    Insects  and the Carcasses of Men by the  Fermentation  and  Volatilization  of the animal Salts from intense Heat produce an universal  Plague  and  Pestilence  as was that of  Athens  and many others Thus far the Change of our  Planet  might have been a natural and necessary Consequence at least the  Elements  or Beginning of such a Depravation of the Bodies of its Inhabitants and their Habitation which no doubt infinite Wisdom and Power who directs the natural and necessary Effects of his  inanimat  Creation for the moral Purposes of his  intelligent  Creatures supernaturally and out of the  general  Law  establish'd for  material  Bodies and  spiritual  Substances may have heighten'd exasperated or even quicken'd according to his Pleasure for the wise Ends and Purposes of his  Providence  and thus might have destroyed that  Paradise  which by Rebellion and Disorder had been abus'd  viz supernaturally  and contrary to the general  Laws  of the  Celestial  Motions might have changed the  Orbit  the  Centre  of  Rotation  the Distance of the  Earth  from the  Sun  and the  Angle  of the  Ecliptic  with the  Equator  to reverse the  Elements  destroy its  Figure  and Structure and thus to weaken the Fertility and produce the rest of the Appearances we now observe on our  Planet  and throughout the whole  Solar System  which have many evident Marks of  Ruin  and Desolation and this for a Punishment and expiatory Purification of the  lapsed  Inhabitants And thus also the  Deluge  might have been brought on after the Destruction of a  paradisaical Globe  by altering only its  Centre  of  Gravity  and after the same Manner other Changes might have been produc'd  § AN  animal  Body is nothing but a  System  or Aggregat of mere mechanical Powers  viz  of  Ropes    Pullies    Levers    Tubes    Glands    Strainers  and the like  viz  One great Pipe with infinite Branches infinite in Number Fitness and Delicacy secreting proper and  specific  Liquors to keep them these Solids in Repair  and preserve them in their due Tone and a proper Degree of  Elasticity  thereby to serve the Intentions and answer the  Ends  of the intelligent Spirit while confin'd to this  Planet  And as I have often used the Similitude I still find it the most proper  viz  that the Body this earthly  Vehicle  and  Machin  is as it were a curious finely contriv'd  Organ  or musical Instrument whose  Keys    Stops  and  Pipes  were all originally elegantly adjusted and duly tun'd for the Use of the  Musician  or indwelling  Spirit  In this Fitness and Propriety to answer the Purposes of the  Creator  does the  Union  consist if that is partly disorder'd this  Union  is partially dissolv'd while the great and necessary Parts are tolerably sound the  Union  will still subsist tho' imperfectly but if these essential  Organs  are quite spoiled the  Union  will be totally dissolv'd and the Inhabitants by the eternal  Laws  of  Spirits  must necessarily find out and pass into some other  astral Vehicle  or  musical Organ  proper for its then Degree of Purity or Corruption as an  Insect  is by the great  Law  of  Instinct  directed to deposit her  Eggs  on those Leaves or Trees that are fittest to preserve and  vivify  them or a  Bird  seeks by  Instinct  the Situation and Materials for her  Nest  that is most proper to shelter and accommodate her  Young  and this perhaps in a continual Progression from  astral Vehicle  to  Vehicle  perpetually refining as the rational free Intelligence  purifies in its  moral  Capacity or Attributes  §  MATTER  or Body is essentially incapable of any thing but  Division    Figure    Motion  and Situation It is naturally  passive  and to make it  active  or capable of  Selfmotion  is an absolute Contradiction and Impossibility for  two  opposite and contrary Principles can never subsist in the same Subject and therefore it must be intirely inert and  passive  and for ever continue in the State it is put in unless it be chang'd by some  external Force  and that can never be effected but by a  Spirit  or spiritual Substance which on the contrary is essentially  selfactive  and  selfmotive  and by its Agency determines the Motion and Rest and different Directions and Actions of Bodies It is true this  Agency  is under certain Restrictions being limited and subjected to the general  Laws  of the  Nature  of Bodies but the Beginning End and Degree of the  Force  and Motion and all other Changes produc'd in Bodies are from the  Energy  and Action of  spiritual  Substances either  primary  or  secondary  original or created so that where Matter  Mechanism  and its Powers and  Laws  end there  spiritual  Agency and  Energy  begin And therefore I fear that Sir  Isaac Newton  's  Spiritus quidam subtilissimus    Descartes  's and  Leibnitz  's  Vortices    Hugens  's and  Fatio  's infinitely rare rapid subtil Matter with the Qualities they must endow them to solve Appearances I mean only in animated Bodies for in Inanimat it may be required nay some such Fluid seems necessary I think is I fear imaginary and without Foundation from sufficient Experiment or the  Anology  of Nature unless by their infinitly subtil Matter they mean real  spiritual  Substance or else the first  Elements  of Bodies for Matter must be extended divisible  inert  and gravitat else it can be no longer Matter and when such immaterial and as it were selfmoving Matter is granted it will separate us but one Step further from  spiritual  Substance and Agency or the perpetual Influence of the  First Cause  in whom all things  live    move and have their Being  And I fear the whole of the Supposition how  mechanical  and adequat soever to answer Appearances in all  animated  Beings and in all Accounts of it given by these great Men has not that Simplicity and Beauty conspicuous in and  essential  and necessary to all the Works of God  i e  to  infinit  Wisdom and Power Of the same kind are  animal Spirits  in the Account of  muscular Motion  and on the whole I can conceive Matter no otherwise but as divided extended mov'd and figur'd and actuated and directed by  Spirit  which only can act on it by its own  selfmotive Energy  tho' that too is limited and circumscrib'd by Matter  in all created  Spirits  If Experiment or repeated Observations should ascertain the Existence of such an infinitely rare and  elastic  Matter necessarily which I fear it will hardly do then we must submit to receive it but I think since  Resistance  will always necessarily accompany Matter in  Motion  how small rare or  elastic  soever it will of consequence at last alter the Figure and Direction and abate the Force and Figure of the Particles so as to render them unfit to produce the Effect and answer present  Appearances  and perhaps this System may be so ordain'd at first thus to end But still as we must stop somewhere at last and admit of  spiritual  Agency to impress the  first  Motion nothing but repeated and undeniable  Experiment  and  Observation  should induce us to multiply Causes and allow any such Fluid intervening between  animated  Matter and the  first  or  secondary  Movers This will be better understood by an  Example  It is well known what Pains have been taken and how many  Hypotheses  have been fram'd not only by  Physicians  but  Geometers  of the  first Rank  to explain  muscular Motion  and all I think hitherto in vain This subtil Matter under the Name of  animal Spirits  or at least in propagating them and even Sir  Isaac  's  Spiritus subtilissimus  has been imploy'd for this Purpose tho' with little Satisfaction to most attentive and qualify'd Judges How much more natural  philosophical  and  simple  is it to suppose the  Nerves  to be infinitly delicat and  mechanically  adjusted membranous  Tubes    Twists  or  Ropes  whose  Elasticity  and  Mechanism  is preserv'd by an internal milky soft  Pith  which Membranes receive their first Impression and  Impulse  from the  selfmotive Principle  within us for the  selfmoveing Principle  must communicat the first Impulse either on this suppos'd intermediat  Fluid  or on these  Membranes  and either of them is equally unintelligible and explicable but the last is the shortest way and therefore likeliest to be the Method of the  Author of Nature  who always works the shortest Way and after the simplest Manner as may be mathematically demonstrated in all his real and natural Workings and communicat and propagat it by proper and  harmonious Oscillations  to the Muscles by whose  mechanical  Structure those  harmonious  Motions are excited into Action by that admirable Mechanism so fully and justly explain'd by the learned and ingenious Dr  Alexander Stewart  How much more simple and natural is it to conceive that the Surfaces of Bodies their Effluvia or repelling  Steams  communicat certain justly proportion'd and commensurable  Undulations    Vibrations  and  Tremors  to such  membranous Pipes  which the natural  Sagacity  of the intelligent Principle knows by its own innate Powers to indicat the Presence of such and such Bodies in the  same Manner as the  Governor  of a besieg'd Town or the several Ships of a  Fleet  understand what such a Number of  Guns  or such a  Flag  import and signify Thus Things are easy intelligible and simple We daily see and hear what fine Pieces of  Music  a skilful  Musician  can fling off a welltun'd Instrument from the various Motions of his  Fingers  or  Voice  But this I propose as a mere Illustration If  Experiment  should shew the Necessity of the mentioned  ethereal Fluid  even then I think it will take Place only in  unanimated Nature  And if there is any Regard to be had to such an  Hypothesis  before it be absolutely decided by Experiment it must be because  Nature  and its  Author  never act by  Starts  Fits and Intervals but by slow uniform and imperceptible Degrees tho' the Progression is often not to be determin'd by finite Experiments or finite Capacities But even tho' the Organs of Sense may and do want  Media  the  animal Functions  are too intimat and necessary to Life to need such  §  LIFE    Activity  and  Intelligence  are natural and necessary in some Degree to all  spiritual  Beings as all the Consequences and Combinations of them are as being  Miniatures    Sparkles  or  Infinitesimals  of the  Deity  All of the same Order  Rank  or  Hierarchy  have these nearly in the same  Degree  and these  Hierarchies  and Ranks differ only in their  Degrees of these primary  Attributes  What may make the most apparent Difference in this  State  of things in the  Individuals  of the same  Rank  or  Species  is perhaps the more coarse or elegant Texture or the Fitness or Unfitness of their  ethereal Vehicles  in their first Formation as they primarily came out of the Hands of their  Maker  All the  radical  Differences conspicuous in the human Race now are owing to the different  Frame    Texture  and  Culture  of their bodily Machin and its spiritual Organs so that  originally  there must have been no Difference of  Sexes  because at  last  in their restor'd and recover'd State there will be none they will in that respect be like the  Angels  as  Revelation  expresly asserts Something  analogous  to  Creative  Fecundity possibly may be even in  Angels  and primarily may have been too in the  human  Race because of their  Similarity  and Resemblance to those  Angels  and to their grand Original the  Deity  I say some  miniature  Resemblance of his  Creative  Power might have been in them Beneficent Nature must be necessarily  communicative  and earnestly desirous there may be infinitly more Beings to contemplat worship and adore the infinitly perfect Being and admire the Operations of his Hands to imitat Him and partake of his  Felicity  But how this  Creative  Power or earnest Desire of more Intelligences operated then I will not take upon me to conjecture But certain it is that the Division  of the  Sexes  was after the  Lapse  was begun and perhaps when it was far advanc'd possibly to put a Drag on it and prevent the final Degeneracy into  Selflove  or an idolatrous and unnatural Commerce with the  brute  Creation  § IT is both  philosophical  and highly probable to suppose that the Bodies as well as the  Spirits  of all the  human  Race were created at one and the same time at least were sent into these  Adamical Dungeons  they now inhabit at one and the same time The Spirit endow'd with the  three  radical Qualities of  Life    Activity  and  Intelligence  in the Perfection that belong'd to its Order and  Species  and the Body in the Perfection of their then Estate at least in the original and first Stock in whose Loins were included in  Miniatures  and  Infinitesimals  in a perpetual Progression descending all the Race and Mass that should ever  exist  of that Species This will be no Difficulty to those who know and understand the infinit Divisibility of Matter and the Doctrine of  first    second    third  and consequent  Fluxions  or  Differences  as they are now demonstrated and explain'd These  infinitesimal  Bodies have probably been animated and growing in their own Manner and according to their  Laws  from their first Formation and from the Time of the primary general  Creation  till they arriv'd at their full Maturity No doubt both these  miniature  and  mature  Bodies were vastly different from what we find our  lapsed  earthly Tabernacles now are As the  Spirit  was perfect in its Kind so was the  Body  As the  Spirit  was pliant supple and chearfully obedient to the Influences of the  Eternal Spirit  which was breath'd into it by the Spirit of God  viz pure disinterested Love  so was the  Body  pliant and obedient to the Commands of the human  Spirit  All was Order Peace Love and  Harmony  and probably the Frame and Figure of the Body might be in many Particulars different from what we now find it as we have observ'd of the Difference of the  Sexes  in the former  Section  and these Differences may be necessary in one State of the Progression and may naturally drop off and decay in another when of no further Use Instances of which we may see in the different Shapes of  seminal  Animalculs  Eggs    Nymphae  and  young Insects  from what they have when arriv'd at Maturity of a  Chick  in the  Egg  from what it is when perfectly grown in the several Stages of the  Silkworm  and most other animated Beings Vegetables as well as Animals And this is a just and wise Contrivance and evidently demonstrates  Design  in the Maker to fit the living Creature for its several Situations But what is most material is that even this now  Adamical  and gross Tabernacle of ours must necessarily contain under it the Principles  Elements  Springs and  linear Root  of that  ethereal  or  paradisaical  Body it was created in and of that perhaps  glorious  Body it will be restor'd to at last in the final Recovery which perhaps are both the same But this can be no Difficulty to those who know that the Rays of the  Sun  are but Matter and Body which may be contain'd in a Dungeon of Putrefaction and in a  Dunghil  as well as in the  azure Sky  and that the Particles of Matter  attract  and  repel  each other in different Circumstances and purify and sublime as well as incraffat and condense by the mere Force and Energy of the present  Laws  of Nature And this  Law  by which the whole Stock of such an Order and Rank of Intelligences advances in a certain  Progression  towards Happiness and Perfection the Confirmation and Stability of which is only to be found in the  last  and most perfect State of Purity and Happiness as being  free  but  finite  and consequently  fallible  Creatures must absolutly depend on and be brought about by Experience confirm'd Habits many appropriated  Trials  and much gradual Labour for nothing is more certain than the Axiom  Nemo repente fit turpissimus aut optimus  This  Law  I say of deriving the whole Race from such a radical Stock in an increasing  Progression  was a  noble  Design and of infinite Love and Wisdom for rendering the succeeding and posterior Generations Partakers of all the Acquisitions of  Wisdom    Knowledge  and other  Improvements  of their Predecessors But as  Corruptio optimi est pessima    by the  Lapse  all the contrary has happen'd and  Aet as parentum pejor avis tulit  Nos nequiores mox daturos  Progeniem vitiosiorem  So that what infinit Love and Goodness could not effect that is render  finite fallible  Intelligences  fixed  and eternally  stable  in Order and Purity  Punishment    Experience  and  Trial  may at last effect tho' in an unnatural and retrograde Manner But for this Misfortune infinit Wisdom is no more to be blam'd than a kind  Father  that leaves a comfortable Subsistence to a  prodigal Son  is to be charg'd with the Miseries and Diseases he has contracted in squandering it  § THERE may possibly be original Difference in the Complexion and Frame of the Spirits of the same  Rank  and  Order  of Intelligences some have one or more of their  natural  and  radical  Attributes in a greater Degree of Perfection than others which certainly are heighten'd by the different Degrees of Perfection and Improvement of their  moral  Qualities it being sufficient to constitute their Degree or Rank that the  Sum total  of their Qualities one to compensat the other be originally pretty near  equal  But I should think the greatest Difference consists in the  Culture The righteous Man is more excellent than his Neighbour  says the  Royal Prophet    which is only from his  cultivating  into higher  Habits  his  moral  Qualities and it is the same with both Parts of the Compound the Qualities of which in all  finite free  Intelligences must ever depend to a certain Degree on  Culture  and  Improvement  in the Docility or Facility of the  Spirit  and  Pliancy  of the Body He that by  Study  entering into his own Heart thinking reflecting remembering and acting cultivats his  Spirit  will continually acquire a Facility Quickness and  Penetration  in  intellectual  Opperations and he that by  Air    Exercise  a low  Diet  and proper and welltim'd  Remedies  improves and heightens his Health and perfects his  animal Functions  will be fitter and more capable to improve his  intellectual  Faculties The bodily  Machine  disorder'd or spoil'd will sink debase blunt and confound the Operations of the  Spirit  and the  Spirit  violently agitated or too closely confin'd will disturb the  Oeconomy  of the bodily Functions and the perfect State of Health and the last Perfection of all intelligent Creatures consisting of an intelligent  Spirit  and a material  Machine  depends on the perfect  Sanity  and  Harmony  of  both  united in their respective  Order  and Rank A superior Degree of Perfection in either will consist with an inferior Degree in the other but when either the  Spirit  is quite uncultivated or in an  infinitesimal Degree  only the  radical  Qualities of  Living    Activity  and  Intelligence    may be dwindled into that one of mere  Living  as in Children and  Ideots  perhaps  Brutes  and when the Body is much in Disorder the  spiritual  Faculties however cultivated either wander at random or act irregularly But the  Fund  of the  Spirit  or the radical Qualities may be eternally the same invariable and unalterable in their  Order  and  Rank  whatever happens to the bodily  Machine  only the sensible and  elicited Acts  will vary and alter or which is the same thing the radical Qualities of  Living    Activity  and  Intelligence  may be invariable in the  Rank  and Degree proper to such a  Species  of spiritual Nature whatever Machine or bodily  Organ  it be cloathed with only it cannot exert its elicit or exterior  Acts  without a proper  Machine  As a  Musician  is still in his Nature and  Fund  a good  Musician  whether he has an  Organ  or musical Instrument to play on or not or whatever sort of musical Instrument he has but he never can perform an  harmonious  pleasant Piece of  Music  without having a perfect and proper  musical  Instrument An  Angel  is still an  Angel  in his Nature whatever  Vehicle  he appear in but cannot perform his Office to the human  Species  unless he appear in some Shape or  Vehicle  familiar and proper to his Commission So that as to the human  Species  the present Body and  Vehicle  was design'd and is necessary only to commerciat and communicat with the  System  of Bodies or Beings  cloathed with material and sensible Appearances and Qualities as they now are in their ruinous State For as to invisible imperceptible and  spiritual  Objects and  Beings  the first  Elements  of any Knowledge about them must intirely and solely be deriv'd from  Analogy  to the Ideas and Resemblances of Things convey'd to the  sentient  Principle through the  Senses  and when these  elementary  Steps are gone through and become familiar and easy  spiritual  Agency and Operation if such be allow'd may then begin its Influence and Effects For when the Mind has been duly cultivated and habituated to a Faculty of  Thinking  to  abstracted  Sentiments Reflections and  Ideas  then rational  spiritual  and closer  Thinking  becomes familiar and easy But the  Rudiments  and initial Procedure must be deriv'd through the Senses in Perceptions and  Ideas  excited by Matter and its Qualities but improved by  Analogy  and its Appendages  Trope    Metaphor    Similitude  and  Hieroglyphic  § THE natural Progression and  final  Cause or Reason of this  Oeconomy  as far as  philosophical  Reasoning may go in such Matters may be this The original and  radical  Qualities of all  spiritual  Natures being as has been often said  Liveing    Activity  and  Intelligence  and these being unalterable and eternally the same in the specific  Order  and Rank a vast Number perhaps of all the several Orders  of the  Hierarchies    lapsed  and fell and ran into Rebellion and Disorder being finite and free and so defac'd and lost their  moral  Qualities of  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  Infinit  Wisdom  and  Love  then always intending to recover and restore his  lapsed  Creatures must by the eternal unalterable  Laws  of his Nature bring it about in a Manner consistent with their original and  radical  Qualities that is by preserving their  Life  or  Liveing  their  Activity  or  Liberty  and their  Intelligence  or  Understanding  In loseing their  moral  Attributes they perhaps lost or spoil'd their  paradisaical  or  glorious  Body with which they were originally cloath'd and were newcloath'd over it with a crass unactive  Tabernacle  or Prison such as we find our present  Adamical  one now is by which means our  radical  Qualities were greatly confin'd and more narrowly circumscrib'd and we were reduc'd to a State of  Annihilation  and Extinction as to them as it were for a long Tract of Time Our radical Qualities of  Liveing    Activity  and  Intelligence  being thus reduc'd to the single one of  Liveing  as the whole human Race actually once were in the  Loins  of their first Parent  Adam  or whoever was the first of the human Race From that time they have been  developeing  extending and unfettering their  Adamical  Tabernacles every one in his Order thus spread over the internal  ethereal  Vehicle till they came to a certain Degree of Maturity and had  form'd the several newcloath'd  Organs  Pipes and Springs of this  second Adamical Machin  fit to perform the  probatory  and  expiatory Harmony  in this Period of Duration in order to acquire and regain their  moral  Attributes of  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  and to return into  Order  and consequential Happiness Finite Beings are absolutely uncapable to regain these  moral  Attributes consistent with their natural and necessary ones but by a gradual Progress  viz  by  Labour    Patience    Experience  and  Trial  by which they may be gradually confirm'd into permanent  Habits  and advanced to the Degree of their Order and  Rank  or perhaps higher and thus their natural Attributes being depress'd and sunk into an Equality with their  moral  Ones by being thus cloathed and circumscrib'd with gross Vehicles their natural Powers are preserv'd from Violence and only  sopited  for a time till the  moral  Qualities begin to rise and then both may go on in the same Pace which it would seem could by no other possible or imaginable Means be so consistently brought about For the natural Attributes of  Liveing    Activity  and  Intelligence  preserv'd at their utmost original Extent must necessarily have counteracted and clashed with the Acquisition of the  moral  Attributes to any Degree of Perfection For Example innate  precise  Knowledge and a penetrating Understanding in any thing in this our  lapsed  Estate would necessarily have counteracted  Dependence Meekness Poverty of Spirit Humility  pure Love  and universal  Charity  and unbounded  Liberty  must have clash'd with Restraints  Submission  and  Resignation  now at least so absolutely necessary to the Acquisition of the  moral  Powers to any Degree and so of the rest of the moral Attributes But by thus depressing the  natural  Attributes to the  Level  of the  moral  ones both may without Violence be in time restor'd to their appointed Order and  Degree  that is they gradually and Step by Step may be turn'd into permanent  Habits  by the Divine Grace and the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  § HENCE the  moral  Attributes being defac'd by the  Lapse  and the  natural  ones brought down to a Level with them by confining them to gross  Vehicles  or Prisons the whole of the  intellectual  Operations must in some measure depend on the bodily  Machin  as well as the Degree and Perfection of the  moral  Attributes in this present  lapsed  State at least in its first Steps and Initiation The  intellectual  Operations can never be so regularly and perfectly exerted while the  Body  is in Disorder a sick and diseased Person seldom  perceives  truly nor reasons justly and a  vicious  Person never judges solidly that is by  Number    Weight  and  Measure  nor acts perfectly But that this may be more clearly understood it may want a little further Detail  I say nothing here of a possible  passive  State in advanced Christianity that being above  Philosophy  or Conjecture and perhaps the last  Scene  of the  Drama  of Restoration  § WHAT Men call a  Genius  or a Man of fine natural Parts a  Hero  or a  Philosopher  before the Fund the whole created spiritual Substance or the moral as well as the natural Attributes be acquir'd and cultivated into a Habit is much owing to the Perfection of the  Machin  or Vehicle and its spiritual or  ethereal  now cloathed over with Clay  Organs  The  intellectual  Faculties require proper  Organs  Springs Ropes and Pipes to perform their Operations by as well as the Senses and these probably are the  Arteriolae    Fibrils  and  membranous Tubuli  prolong'd of the cortical and glandular Parts of the Brain which are diversify'd and delicatly modify'd  ad infinitum  the Detail and Mechanism of which never was nor perhaps ever will be  philosophically  explain'd But that the Perfection of the  intellectual  Operations in our present State depends in some measure on the Soundness and  Integrity  of the Body and these particular  Organs  there are many undeniable Evidences to prove as shall be afterwards shewn What I would here insinuat is that the  Delicacy  Fineness and Perfection of one  Set  of these intellectual  Organs  beyond that of another  Set  is that which makes the  Genius    Hero  or  Philosopher  Thus the Health of the Body being good and sound if a Man has warm but sharp  Blood  with very  elastic  and strong  pungent Nerves  but the particular  Organs  of  Thinking  Attention and Reflection indifferently agile only he may make a  Hero  If his Blood be  cool    soft    mild  and  sweet  and his intellectual Organs very  elastic  or agile he may make a  Philosopher  or  Lawgiver  And so of the other Differences of natural  Spirits  among the human  Race  in all of whom the  Fund  or natural Attributes may be pretty near  equal  But whatever Equality there may be in the  natural  Qualities of such  Spirits  the Difference in the  moral  ones makes the human  Species  to differ at last widely even in the Exercise of  natural  ones For the true  Criterion  of a right and sound Understanding and perfect Judgment is to examin things by  Number    Weight  and  Measure  according to their Nature and Relations and then to estimat and prefer them according to their  intrinsic  Worth and Importance thus determin'd and in this Sense it is true only  that the righteous Man is more excellent than his Neighbour  that is wiser as well as better And that the Acquisition and Culture of the  moral  Qualities not only shew the Justness and Strength of the  natural  ones but also inlarge augment and perfect  them  both as they necessarily mend and improve the bodily  Health  by Temperance and Abstinence and consequently rectify and  tune  the  Organs  of the intellectual Faculties but likewise as they cultivat and extend all the Powers of the  Spirit  by Study  close Thinking  by  Actions  and  Abstraction  and other intellectual Operations imploy'd in the Acquisition and Exercise of these  moral  Qualities  § THAT the  Perfection  and full free and just Use of the  intellectual  Faculties depends in a great measure on the Soundness and Health of the bodily  Machin  more particularly of the  Organs  of these  intellectual  Faculties is evident from many Considerations  st  The Body was design'd to concentre and circumscribe the  spiritual  Powers to confine and imprison them for a time and fit them only grosly to  commerciat  with other Bodies on this present  ruinous  Planet and must purify and refine according to the Degree of the Acquisition and Perfection of the  moral  Attributes as has been explain'd and every Step in this Acquisition necessarily tends to  develop  and  inlarge  the  natural  and  radical  Attributes as has likewise been hinted from whence their mutual Dependence on each other becomes evident In this our  lapsed  State our gross and earthly Prisons were design'd by infinit Wisdom to curb concentre and restrain the exalted  Functions  of the  radical  and intellectual Faculties in Proportion to the Defacement and Decay of the  moral  ones that being both on a  Level  they might rise advance and perfect by  equal Degrees without Clashing or Contradiction without which our Ruin must have been eternal our  Lapse  perpetual and our  Recovery  impossible the  natural  and  radical  Qualities in their utmost Extent being evidently contradictory to and destructive of the Acquisition and Improvement of the  moral  ones and the whole  Restoration  must be brought about by the Culture of the  moral  Qualities which perfect and develop the  natural  ones and thereby  purify  and  sublime  the  Vehicle  extend and form the intellectual  Organs  So that in the first Steps at least of this  Progressive  Purification the Perfection of the  Acts  of the  intellectual  Faculties depend on and are in proportion to the Perfection of their  natural  and bodily  Organs dly  We experimentally find the  intellectual  Faculties and Operations depend on the Body in all  acute  and  chronical  especially those called  nervous  Distempers the  Raveings    Incoherences  and  Distractions  in the  first  and the unaccountable  Terrors    Panics    Inconstancies  Dispondence and  Cowardice  of the  last  are sufficient Proofs of  this  and demonstrat the Necessity of a proper  Crase  in the Juices and the Soundness and proper  Elasticity  of the Solids and  Organs  in all the intellectual  Functions  and Operations but eminently so in the first Steps of our Renovation  dly  We actually find and are ocularly sensible in an  Embryo  in Infancy in  seminal Miniatures  that the  whole of the  natural Powers  are concentred and imprison'd and that it is in their Growth only and in the developing of their  Organs  and in the Inlargement of the Doors Windows and Aperture of the Senses that their intellectual Faculties ever inlarge themselves to any Degree  thly  We find that  Luxury    Leachery  Intemperance Laziness strong and violent  Passions  inclement and pestilential  Air  Bruises and Accidents that injure the  arterial  and  nervous System  always hurt and sometimes destroy the  free Exercise  of these Faculties and the Acquisition of Virtue at least of some Virtues as well as  Science  and that proper Remedies and due Management recover and restore them again  thly  Abstracting from the  Probability  and  analogical  Evidence that the Bodies of the whole Race were actually form'd liv'd grew and extended in the Loins of the first  original  Pair we see plainly as I have hinted that every Individual begins with as it were a mere  vegetable  Life while in  Embryo  in seminal  Miniature  and in the Mother's Womb that when it is born it has scarce more than an  animal  Life in which it continues much longer than any other  Animal  we know and that it rises by slow and imperceptible Degrees into a  rational  Life From which it is evident that the Powers of the  Soul  are sunk concentred imprison'd and contracted by its unform'd Tabernacle or  organical  Vehicle and cannot exert its intellectual  Functions  but  gradually and insensibly and as the bodily and intellectual  Organs  are form'd and that for this wise and gracious End That the  moral  Powers and Virtues of the Soul may have  Time    Liberty  and  Leisure  by repeated  Acts  to turn into  Habits  and so all  three  may equally develop and extend together  viz  the  natural  and radical Powers which in their Capacity and original  Energy  are invariable and the  moral  Attributes of the Soul and their mechanical and material Organs  thly  But what is in this Case a Demonstration is that all the vital Functions and  Sensations  are all perform'd by the  Spirit  by the Intermediation only of Motions  Vibrations  and Tremors properly modify'd and impress'd by Bodies or their  Effluvia  on rightly dispos'd  membranous Tubuli    elastic  Threads or Filaments which Motions or  Vibrations  the  Soul  naturally and by its own innate and  radical  Powers and Sagacity knows to denote the Presence of such and such Bodies and their Actions Thus  Seeing  is perform'd by the Impressions of the Rays of  Light  emitted or reflected by the Surfaces of Bodies which by the Size of their component Particles and other Circumstances exciteing particular  Vibrations  and  Undulations  on the  elastic optic Nerves  point out to the sagacious  Spirit  innately and naturally endow'd with such a Capacity of Perceiving and Judging the Presence of such and such Bodies And in a Manner  analogous  to this is  Hearing    Feeling  and all the other  Senses perform'd and muscular Motion may be perform'd much in the same way  thly  To confirm all this and that Observations and  Fact  may justify and demonstrat  Speculation  it is certain and almost infallible that  ponderous  Medicines duly and properly prepar'd and adjusted and a  low    cool    thin Diet  persisted in a due Time and join'd with Air and Exercise will generally restore the  free  and perfect Use of the  intellectual  Faculties not only to those who have destroy'd or hurt them by  Luxury  and  Laziness  but even to such as have deriv'd them with their Birth or from Accidents or Parents if the  Organs  themselves be not intirely confounded or spoil'd at least in some Degree sufficient to demonstrat the Proposition and every one knows that this  Method  and these  Medicines  only mend the Juices and open Obstructions Of this I could give some such Instances having treated several such Cases that I could venture my Reputation on some Degree of Success of the Method when apply'd early and in due Time before the  noble Organs  be quite spoil'd And if  Philosophy  have any thing certain or true it is this that  quo posito ponitur    quo sublato tollitur    in eo consistit ejus rei Essentia  A great deal more I could urge but this must suffice to the honest  Inquirer  and fair  Philosopher  else nothing will  § FROM all which it is evident that it is to  Experience    Culture  and  Probation  removing Obstacles and Impediments that we must apply both for the Extention and Improvement of the  natural  and  moral  Powers of the  Soul  and for the Perfection of the intellectual  Organs  of the Body All  three  since the  Lapse  have been contracted imprison'd or concentred as it were to a  Punctum Saliens  as the Naturalists speak of the beginning  Incubation  of a Chick from an Egg to be extended and dilated to a given State of Maturity and Perfection altogether proper for its  Order  and Rank and alone and only to be brought about at first by the Culture of others its Parents Nurses and Masters while under Age and afterwards by its own  Industry    Attention  and  Diligence  in a proper Method when come to Maturity So that the whole Perfection of Body  Soul  and  Spirit  by Soul and Spirit I always mean the  natural  and  moral  Powers depend on proper  Culture    Experience  and  Trials  and our whole  lapsed  State is probatory  experimental  and  progressive  and from our vegetable through our brutal and rational up to our  restored  first  paradisaical  and last divine fix'd and immoveable State the whole Progress is in a great measure our own Work tho' under general  Laws  both for  Spirits  and Bodies but with supernatural or if you please  miraculous  Aids and Assistances  from time to time to be the Rewards and Motives of our Diligence and Zeal tho' perhaps they are never to be felt or distinguish'd till the whole Progression is at an End which Progression might or may be much after  this Manner  as far as can be conjectur'd from things as they now appear The human Race was originally made in the  Scale  of Intelligences and in that  Cone  of Creation if I may be allow'd the Similitude without offending weak Minds and low  Philosophers  which seems to ascend from  inert  and  passive Matter  through the human  Species  to the  Angels  and beyond the  Cherubims  and  Seraphins  up to the utmost Extent that created finite free Intelligence reaches all which in their natural Powers are  Infinitesimals  respectively and unalterably of their great Original the  Deity  but at an infinitly infinit Distance from Him as they ought and must be but in a verging Progression of  Similarity  to him in their  natural  as well as  moral  Powers I say the human  Species  being made a little lower only than the  Angels  with Bodies or earthly  Machins  supple and pliant to their in dwelling  spiritual  Intelligences and with  Spirits  supple and pliant to the Influences Impulses and Commands of the  Father of Spirits  in which their Innocence and Felicity consisted and being free and consequently capable of a  progressive  Procedure from this original State of their Creation either forward to Perfection and Happiness to  a certain Degree which probably might fix them in the Extention of their  original  Powers tho' not in the greatest Perfection of their  moral  ones and consequently in their greatest Happiness or a  Departure  backward into Disorder Rebellion spurious  Selflove  inordinat Love of the Creatures  Propriety  and consequently  Misery  their  Creator  eternally designing to restore them to their first or perhaps a  higher  Rank plac'd them first upon this Ball of Clay which had been either naturally and  physically  ruin'd and spoil'd by their own immoral Taint and Corruption or was by his own  omnipotent  Agency and confin'd them to  Prisons  and  Dungeons  made of this  Planet  tho' with infinit Wisdom and Elegancy and with a sublime Delicacy adjusted to the Nature of their  Lapse  or the Ends of their  Probation  and Purification whereby their natural Powers being  cramp'd  and concentred to the Degree of the Decay of their  moral  Powers they may by their own Labour and Culture but supernaturally assisted advance proportionally in both to the Stature and Degree appointed them in their original Formation and perhaps higher and in the mean time perhaps dropping through many different  Vehicles  and material Bodies grosser or more sublime either Dungeons or partially glorious Bodies as they have advanced or gone backward in the Acquisition of the  moral  Attributes  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  or which  is the same in the  Christian  Language of the Cardinal Virtues  Faith    Hope  and  Charity  which justly explain'd are of the same Import  § THE human  Soul  or intelligent Principle has its  radical  Qualities and Faculties that it was endow'd with in its first  Creation  essentially inherent and  innate  in its Nature and in their full Extent and Perfection even now in this  lapsed  State perhaps beyond the Vigour they can ever arrive at in this mortal Life only cramp'd and sopited by this gross and earthly Prison like a  Felon  in a  Dungeon  or condemn'd Hole and as it has the Power or Root of the Senses of  Seeing    Hearing  and  Feeling  almost the same as when at intire Liberty in its ethereal Vehicle tho' now confin'd to Darkness  Silence  and  Unactivity  and can only see and hear as through a  Grate  or narrow  Chink  yet it has its natural Powers and their bodily  Organs  as vigorous and lively as when it was at large tho' it be not in a Capacity to exert them in the same Degree by reason of its heavy clay Coverlet And this gross earthly Tabernacle actually contains under it the  organical  Lines and  Stamina  of that glorious  paradisaical  and first created Body it was endow'd with before the  Lapse  or of the more glorious one it will be solely cloath'd with in its  final  Perfection and Restoration tho' both for they are one and the same now cover'd  over and encrusted with gross mouldering Clay and both Soul and Body as they are now in this  lapsed  State will gradually drop and put off this  Adamical  Tabernacle and slide into another and perhaps a third according to the general  Laws  of Purification and in Proportion as the  spiritual  Inhabitant advances in Perfection till at last it arrive at that  fix'd  and  permanent  State and the Place and  Mansion  it was design'd for in the universal  System  of Intelligences  § FROM this Account if agreeable with the universal  Analogy  of Things and the general  Laws  of Providence relating to the  Lapse  and Purification of Intelligences it will follow that intellectual Acts and Exercises are but  Remembrance  and removeing Impediments or but the Spirit's returning to its  original  and primitive State That  Culture  Study and Reflection and all the Operations of the  Mind  are really and not figuratively but  lopping    pruning  dressing and removeing Obstacles and Incumbrances and forming the bodily  Organs  to a proper Suppleness and Facility for the Performance of  spiritual  Exercises and to produce  Habits  That the Study of  Arts  and  Sciences  and all other Knowledge is but  Remembrance  and Recollection opening Passages and  Apertures  to admit more Light into the  Prison  and Dungeon which can only effectually be done by the Acquisition  of the  moral  Powers of  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  or of  Faith    Hope  and  Charity  and this not figuratively but in Reality and by fix'd Habits In a word the  Soul  has essentially and radically in its  Fund  and Nature  innate  and  permanent  all the natural Powers in their full Extent and Degree that ever it can possibly arrive at here but they cover'd over sopited and concentred by the gross  Adamical  Prison and is only depriv'd of its  moral  Powers in its present  lapsed  State which  moral  Powers it is sent here to recover  § THE Exercise of the  natural  Powers of the  Soul    viz  of  Liveing    Activity  and  Intelligence  is the general State and Complexion of all spiritual Natures  Liveing  means supposes and implies the  actuating  informing directing and superintending the several Motions and Functions of a divinely organiz'd Material either  Ethereal  or  Planetary  grosser or more refin'd Vehicle according to the  Oeconomy  of Providence in its Restoration and in giving Motions and Directions to Bodies or Matter to a certain Degree  Memory  is but an Affection or Modification of the  Understanding  fixing it to a particular Object as  seeking  any thing absent or lost is but a particular Attention and Observation or Detention of the  Eye  on the different Objects presented and that the Understanding has proper  Organs  for the different Uses and  Purposes of Perceiving Considering and fixing its  Attention  as the  Eye  has various Muscles Tendons Humours and Glands for directing fixing and perfecting its  Sight  and  Memory  is just such a  Modification  of the Understanding as  Searching  or Seeking is of the  Eye  and all is perform'd through the  mechanical  Powers and  Organs  of the Body by the innate Sagacity of the Mind and hence it comes to pass that when these  mechanical  Powers and  Organs  of the Body are quick and agile to present Variety of  Images    Pictures  and  Ideas  with Readiness the Person is  ingegious    fanciful    poetical  or of a quick and lively Imagination If the  Organs  of the Imagination the nervous  Fibrillae  the membranous  Tubuli  be strong and firm the Impressions or  Ideas  being dureable the  Memory  becomes strong The Understanding is merely  passive  it is like the  Vis Inertiae  of Matter or Reflection and Refraction in it of which it is the  analogous  Quality in the Soul and this  Vis Inertiae  is one of the last Steps of the descending Miniature of the divine Original in his inanimat Creation  Truth  is to the Understanding what  Light  is in animal Life to the  Eye  it must be receiv'd absolutely and only according to the then State of the  Mind  It is the  Will  that is the ruling and directing Faculty of  spiritual  Nature and its  analogous  Quality in inanimated  Matter is  Attraction  and  Repulsion  all depend on it it rules absolutely and without Controul even sometimes over the Understanding and every Faculty of the  Soul  It is the  selfactive  and  selfmotive  Principle acting above and beyond Matter at a Distance without the Intervention of a material  Medium  by its own  Energy  and after its specific manner of Operation as is evident from  Instinct    Impulse    Sympathy  and  Antipathy  Conscience natural Affection and the like  immechanical  Affections of the Soul  Matter  only limits and modifies its Operations and renders it capable to commerciat and communicat with Bodies by acting upon them and being reacted upon by them The  Will  may and can act without and contrary to the Judgment Conviction and Approbation of the  Understanding  Selfactivity and Selfmobility necessarily secluding all foreign Aid and from it the first  Springs  Direction and Perfection of the  Understanding  often take their Rise but generally they advance by the same Steps in their Purification only the  probatory  and purifying Process in the  lapsed  State both in the Acquisition of the  moral  Attributes and in the  Culture  and  Development  of the bodily  Organs  of the Faculties gradually and by uniform Acceleration like the  Velocity  of descending Bodies receives its constant Impulse from the  Will  § SOME have thought that the  Wills  of all  Intelligences  were so order'd by the divine Decree and Appointment that they should be so absolutely free as to become even independent of his  Influence  and  Prescience  and that their  Liberty  should be in a natural  Equilibrium  to do whatever their original Powers could possibly effect and be determin'd by their own  Strength  only and affirm'd that so much a  selfmotive  Power does necessarily imply and that accordingly  God  was not actually certified of the  Lapse  till it happen'd in the  Angelical Hierarchy  That the divine Nature may actually have  arbitrary Ideas  they think necessarily follows from his natural infinit  Liberty  which they suppose a Consequence of the absolute  Infinitude  of all his Attributes and the  Base  and Root of his infinit  Intelligence  or  Omniscience  For no Creature is  free  but must be at the same time  intelligent  and all intelligent Creatures are naturally  Images  of  Him  and since  intelligent  Creatures such as we are have  arbitrary Ideas  as is evident from our being able to act contrary to our  Judgment  and contrary to our present and future greater  Good  were it but to shew the Nature of our  Liberty  in any one Instance for  Example  to suffer present or future certain Pain as in  Suicide  therefore there must by  Analogy  be concluded  a correspondent Power of infinitly more Force and Perfection in the divine Nature It is true  Omniscience  could certainly  foreknow  whatever  Omnipotence  could effect but both  Omniscience  and  Omnipotence  being in the divine Nature infinitly  free  they think it a higher Instance of Perfection and Power for a  free Omniscience  voluntarily to design not to know what his  Omnipotence  might effect on his free  intelligent  Creation and that it implies not want of Perfection and Power but on the  contrary  is a much higher Instance of Perfection and Power for an infinitly  perfect Being  to create Intelligences that should be naturally in such a Degree of  Freedom  that even He Himself should not foreknow what they were to do but should as it were  voluntarily  and  arbitrarily  suspend  Jesus Christ  say the  Fathers  suspended the Influence of his  Divinity  on his  Humanity    He made Himself of no Report    He took upon Himself the Form of a Servant  the greatest Instance of his Divinity possible the Influence and Penetration of his  Omniscience  to magnify and manifest his  Omnipotence  He might no doubt have foreknown every thing that should ever be effected or brought to pass by the  selfmotive  Powers of his created  miniature Images  but He might also designedly and arbitrarily not  foresee  or  foreknow  all this to  enoble  his intelligent Creatures thereby that  so they might be  free  even from his  Espial  and  Observation  for a Trial of their  Faith  and  Patience  as a tender Mother tries her  Fondlings  Strength and  Gait  by letting go the  Leadingstring  and thus leave them a Possession and Property that they might be fitter Objects of his  Commerce  and  Glory  and that they might have something in  Dominion  and  Heritage  that in Gratitude they might render back to  Him  which even He now He had created them could not  force  from them Perhaps such a  Creature  might become a nobler Instance of infinit  Wisdom  and  Power  than one all whose future Thoughts and Actions were certainly foreknown even by  Omniscience  as a skilful  Watchmaker  might make a  Watch  or  Clock  whose Time of Going or Striking he might not foreknow or could not foretel that absolutly depending on the Length of the  Chain  tied to the  Spring  or  Weight  which he had in his Power not to have measur'd This bold and profane Supposition of  God  's design'd and  arbitrary Nonforeknowledge  of his finite free Intelligences future Actions would indeed intirely take off all the  Difficulties  and  Objections  against the  Lapse  about  Liberty    Prescience  and  Predestination  and justify the Darkness and Distresses in  Providence    Revelation  and the whole  Oeconomy of the Restoration  but whether it is perfectly consistent  with the  Harmony  and  Simplicity  and absolute  Infinitude  and Dignity of the divine Nature and  Attributes  I dare not take upon me to determin And since infinit  Sagacity  and  Penetration  like that of a  wise  and  good Minister  of State will account for  Prescience  without influencing or intrenching on  Liberty  I am much rather inclin'd to subscribe to it  Infinit Perfection  can provide for the Perfection and Happiness of his Creature without any Prejudice to  Himself  § ALL  intelligent  Creatures being as I have often said  Effluxes    Emanations  and analogous  Infinitesimals  of the  Deity  must necessarily be impress'd with his  Image  for though they be finite dependent and created yet being  free  so far they are little  analogical Divinities  and though they flow'd from Him as their  Source  yet by this their  Liberty  they are able to hold as it were in  Property  an  infinitesimal  Portion of his spiritual Nature and Qualities and thereby have something of their  own  to give Him back and thus to  commerciat  with Him and at last to return to Him as their  last End  just as the  last  and  least  Particles of Water being probably  spherical  or  spheroidical  may retain their own Figure when receiv'd into the universal  Volume  of all Fluids of the  Ocean  and are actuated by its Motions or like the  Fish  which though in the  Sea  yet  all of them preserve their own Forms or rather like the  Iron  in the Oven which being turn'd into liquified  Fire  yet retains its own Shape Just so all created Intelligences may preserve their own Principles of  Individuation  when they are restor'd  to the Rock out of which they were hewn  But these lame and unanimated  Allusions  I adduce only as  Illustrations  of this incomprehensible Subject for  Creation  though a necessary Article to be believ'd in all the  Systems  of  Natural Religion  is as incomprehensible and inexplicable as any  Mystery  in  Reveal'd  unless it be by  Analogy  and it is no hard Matter then to conceive any thing  is  that actually  exists  especially where infinit Power is suppos'd the  Cause  and when it does not involve an absolute Contradiction as these  analogical  Allusions shew this does not However this Explication be receiv'd I think it  selfevident  that in their  Creation  or  Emanation  from the  first Cause  all  Intelligences  have been impress'd with  God  's  Image  and are really thereby  infinitesimal Deities  And that the natural  Powers    Attributes  and  Faculties  we feel in our own Souls may fairly be carried up to  absolute Infinitude  by  Analogy  and in some imperfect and gross manner be so rais'd as to give a shadowy Glance or faint  Idea  of the  supreme Being  the  Deity  And that our Liberty may not be violated and our Restoration may be secur'd I fear this is as  precise  as we can reach in this our  lapsed  Estate while we dwell in earthly Prisons I mean by  Philosophy  or mere Reasoning only without  Revelation  or divine  Faith  And therefore whatever  natural  Powers Qualities or Faculties we find in our own  Souls  at least in the best and most perfect of our  Race  we may safely conclude there are Powers Qualities and Faculties eminently correspondent and  analogous  to them in the  divine Nature  with the Difference that  absolute Infinitude  has to the  lowest Finite  and on the other hand that there are  miniature  Resemblances in all finite  Intelligences  correspondent and  analogous  to the essential and fundamental Attributes in the  divine Nature  and consequently that we may fairly reason and  philosophize  with the Modesty and Humility that become the  lowest  of Intelligences from our own  spiritual  Nature up to the  Divine  spiritual Nature keeping within the Bounds and Proportion mentioned For Example we find and certainly know that in our own  spiritual  Nature there are Liveing Understanding and Will and that all our intellectual Operations are but  Modifications  of  these These  then must be the  natural  Image of the  divine  Being originally impress'd on our  Souls  We learn from  Revelation  that in the  divine  Nature there is a  Trinity  of Persons in  Unity  of Substance We may then  fairly conclude that in some Manner or other the  three radical  Powers of  Liveing    Understanding  and  Will  are the  natural  miniature Image and Representation of this  Trinity  in Unity In the divine Nature the three  analogous  and correspondent Attributes are  Selfexistence    Omniscience  and  Omnipotence  in other Words Necessity of  Being  infinit  Wisdom  and infinit  Activity  In all created Intelligences there are a  deriv'd  Being or Liveing  finite  Understanding and limited  Will  or  Freedom  This  Analogy  or Correspondence I say between the  divine  Nature and the  spiritual  Nature of all finite Intelligences may give us at least some general Notion of the  Trinity  in  Unity  for  Precision  is incompatible with  Finitude  and all I pretend to here is to remove Contradiction and Impossibility from an uncomprehensible and inexplicable  Mystery    Selfexistence  or Necessity of Being is the proper  Characteristic  of the  Father  in Revelation  I am that I am  or I am the sole Being that is  necessary Existence  The  Word  the  Wisdom  the  Understanding  of the  Father  the  express Image  of his intelligent Nature the  sovereign Reason  is the  Characteristic  of the  Son  in Scripture The  Holy Ghost  or the Spirit of the Father and the Son  viz  their infinit  Activity    Energy  and  Power  is represented there as a  liveing    enlightening    actuating    comforting  and  instructing  intelligent Substance and shadowed out to us by the most penetrating  energic  Things known to wit  Wind    Light  and  Fire  and so may be explain'd by our  selfmotive  Power our Liberty the Spring of  pure Love    naked Faith  and  universal Resignation  All these  three  and I think the natural Attributes of the Deity are but Three natural Powers and Faculties are comprehended in one  spiritual  Nature in all created Intelligences in them they are  Modalities  only Powers or Faculties but in the  divine  Nature they are  Realities  and active distinguish'd Subsistences because of its infinit  Activity  For nothing is more certain in  Philosophy  than the  metaphysical  and  scholastic Axiom    that every thing in God    is God  I might with a good deal of  philosophical  Propriety run this  Analogy  up to all the Qualities and Attributes ascrib'd in  Scripture  to the Persons of the  holy Trinity  but I give it only as a philosophical  Emblem    Allusion  or  Similitude  to reconcile that  inexplicable Mystery  to modest sober and guarded Thinkers for it is still much better to adore and obey and wish or pray to believe as the  Holy Spirit  in Revelation intended the  best we can  in the  holy Trinity  than to  philosophize  about it The two capital Errors in the Doctrine of the  Trinity  especially of the  Incarnation  and divine Nature of the  Persons  which is the Hinge of the Doctrine of the Trinity is the  Arian  and  Sabellian  Heresies both which are of great Detriment to Christian Perfection and the Practice of its cardinal Virtues  Faith    Hope  and  Charity  or the Acquisition of the  moral Powers  of the  Soul  but with a very notable Difference the  Arian  being of infinitly more Detriment to  sublime practical Christianity  than the  Sabellian  Heresy The  first  dwindling and sinking the Merit Dignity and Love his Sufferings and Satisfaction and consequently dishonouring and debasing the  divine  Nature Purity and the Merit of the common  Saviour  of the  lapsed  Mortals and thereby the Motives and Necessity of  pure Love    naked Faith  and  universal Resignation  the sole Means of our Recovery and Immobility And perhaps among all the  Apostles    Martyrs  and  Confessors  and universally acknowledg'd  Saints  there will not be found one who notably lean'd to this  Heresy  The  Sabellian  on the contrary tho' certainly  Heretical  too arrogantly departing from the  Form of sound Words  yet has preserv'd the  Dignity  and Purity of all these  Motives  the Greatness of the  Love of God  the  Sanctity  of his Nature and  Heinousness  of Sin and is only too philosophically  nice  out of a Dread of intrenching on the  Unity  of the divine Nature I was the more willing to retouch this  Speculation    because what I have advanc'd about it in my  Philosophical Principles of Reveal'd Religion  has been misunderstood else I had not meddled with it  here  as being out of my present Province for which I ought to beg the Reader's Pardon This  Mystery  was not reveal'd to puzzle our Reason but for a Trial of our  Faith  and a Motive to our Resignation and because its Truth was necessary to the Conception of the general  Plan  of the Restoration and the understanding practiseing and perfecting the Christian Virtues and  Morality  § THE  Soul  and  Body  at first sopited in a State of mere  vegetable  Life in the  seminal Animalcul  and in  Embryo  is there developing  vegetats  and lives perhaps for many Ages according to their own general  Laws  and the secret Designs of Providence in Time the  Compound  comes into the  Light  and is born into the World and then from the Velocity of its Growth and the  Development  of the  Organs  of its Faculties the nervous membranous  Tubuli  and the  glandular Machinulae  perhaps increasing first becomes  sensitive  and enjoys  animal  Life The Nature of  gross  Matter the Miseries of this ruinous  Globe  and the present dark State of Things inclement or deleterious  Air  Negligence and Ignorance and many other Accidents all under the Direction  of an  infinitly  wise Being for kind and gracious Purposes make the slender Individual now become  sensitive  and feel Pain Misery and Distress even before it is  conscious  or capable to know the  Cause  Instinct a plain but  innate  Effect Pains and Sufferings make it  mechanically  as it were avoid the Approach of the Causes possible or probable by which these Pains are produc'd Hence natural Aversion Reluctance and some Endeavours to retire from Excess of Colds and Heats improper or too much Nutriment and all noxious Bodies and  Animals  These  Sensations  and Feelings lodg'd in the  Memory  with the innate  Instincts    Sympathies  and  Antipathies  grow stronger till they are gradually confirm'd into  Habits  and on these infant  Habits  and  Ideas  begin the Dawnings of  Reason    Reflection    Memory  and  Will  and all the Play of the  intellectual  Faculties on their now developing  Organs  If the Body is strong its Appetites and Passions are proportionally so which inordinatly gratified naturally and necessarily beget strong and new Pains and Punishments these on Reflection and Remembrance awaken  Conscience  arising from an  innate Instinct  radically implanted in spiritual Nature to excite and encourage a Love of  Order  and punish Disorder and  Conscience  actuated and enliven'd by still further Reflection on the necessary and natural Connexion  between  Disorder    Crime  and  Punishment  on the first Dawnings and Awakening into rational and  conscious  Life if Children were duely and strenuously nurtur'd and cultivated by frequent Acts as Occasions offer and supported by due Temperance Air and Exercise in the bodily and  organical  Powers and by bringing the Appetites and Passions in Subjection to the  Spirit  and thereby labouring to acquire a Facility and Readiness in the Exercise of the  moral  Powers as the  natural  ones advance they would in due Time raise the  Adamical  Compound to all the Perfection and consequent Happiness this present  State  would admit in the full and free Exercise of the  natural  Powers and the Acquisition of the  moral  ones tho' not to the greatest yet to a competent Degree and to the most perfect and orderly Condition this present probatory and expiatory State will admit But the Nature of Things in and about us is such and the Miseries and Sufferings are so constant unavoidable and pungent as will naturally and necessarily excite in a Mind cultivated after the Manner has been describ'd an anxious Desire to inquire and examin if there be any possible Means to be freed from them at last and if there can be any rational and probable Way to secure at least after this  State  is past and this  Adamical  clay Tabernacle is laid down some State of Being at least no worse and as much  better as may be on our going into another Mansion And this is the precise Condition of Mind infinit  Love  and  Wisdom  intends to bring his rational  lapsed  Intelligences into by this wise  Oeconomy  for under such a Disposition sooner or later they will be fitted to hearken to to examin and seriously to inquire into the Truth of  Revelation  and heartily to say  Lord what shall I do to be saved  END of the FOURTH DISCOURSE  DISCOURSE V Philosophical CONJECTURES ON NATURAL ANALOGY ITS LAWS AND SOME OF ITS CONSEQUENCES  Cor xiii  For now we see through a Glass darkley  Cor iv  While we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are Temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal  DISCOURSE V  Philosophical CONJECTURES ON NATURAL ANALOGY its LAWS and some of their CONSEQUENCES  THINGS may differ in the  Degrees  of the same Qualities as well as in  Kind  as in a  Cube  of Gold and one of Lead in  spiritual  and  material Substances  and the like  DEFINITION I  DIFFERENCE  in  Degrees  only is where things having their  essential  Qualities common admit in these Qualities a  More  and a  Less  or a Difference in their Degrees For Example A  Miniature  and a Picture to the Life a  Cube  and a  Parallelopipedon  of the same Substance and on the same Base a  Man  and a  Child  DEFINIT II  DIFFERENCE  in Kind is only where some  essential  Qualities in the things  compar'd are  common  some are  different  as a  Vegetable  and an  Animal    Matter  and  Spirit  a  Cube  of Gold and one of Lead  DEFINIT III  BY  Ratio  is here meant the Relation or Reference of any two things compar'd to one another whose essential Qualities admit of  Degrees  or of a  More  and a  Less  as between a  Brute  and a  Man  a  Man  and an  Angel  and between different  Bodies  of the same Substance  DEFINIT IV  SIMILARITY  is where there is an Equality or  Sameness  of  Ratio's  in the Substance and essential Qualities of things  differing  only by a  More  and a  Less  For Distinction's sake in abstracted or simple Ideas or in  Qualities  I should call this  Sameness  or Equality of  Ratio's  a  Similitude  or  Likeness  as in Problems of  Arithmetic  and  Geometry  in Heat and Cold in Light and Darkness and the like In  Things    Substances  or  Aggregats  of Qualities I should call it  Similarity  as in all the Individuals of the human  Species  in  Animals  and  Vegetables  of the same  Tribe  and their Progress from the  Embrio  or  Seed  to Maturity I should pronounce them I say in a  Similarity  of  Ratio's  DEFINIT V  THINGS    Substances  and  Qualities  are meant to be progressive or in a  Progression  which are constantly increasing or decreasing  similarly  For Example The concave Surfaces that make a  Globe  as the Coats of an  Onion  the Membrans of the  Cornea  of the Eye the  Puncta Salientia  that become Animals the Mathematical Point whose Fluxion describes a Line the Mathematical Line whose Fluxion makes a Surface and the Mathematical Surface whose Fluxion makes a Solid  SCHOLIUM  SPACE  and  Time    Motion  and its  Velocity  seem to be no  Realities  at least no external  Realities  but the mere Modifications and different Circumstances and Situations of  Bodies  or  Matter  and so nothing but mere abstracted  Ideas  or an easier and clearer Manner for our finite Conceptions which cannot comprehend any complicated Thing at once A particular  Space  or the  Locality  of a Body seems to be a mere Mathematical abstracted Solid so to speak or the last  Limit  or  Term  of a Mathematical Solid or of Body  evanishing  such an one as a  Point  is of a  Mathematical Line  a  Line  of a  Mathematical Surface  and a  Surface  of a  Mathematical Solid  only here the whole Content of the  Mathematical Solid  or  evanishing  Body is comprehended  in the  Idea  The same way of Reasoning may be applied to  Time    Motion  and  Velocity  which are but the  Limits    Modifications  and particular Circumstances of  Body  or  Matter  and have no external  Realities  but like the  Shadow  that depends on the  Light  shineing on the Body they all admit of  Degrees  or a  More  and a  Less  as belonging to and connected with  Matter  and  Bodies  A particular  Space  is to a particular  Body  what  o  or the relative  Infinitesimal  is to a particular given Progression and an  Infinit Body  like  infinit Space  is a mere imaginary  Idea  the last Term or Limit of an ascending Progression as  o  is of a descending one Suppose for  Example  a Progression of the Powers of Natural Numbers or their Cossic Characters descending  c  +  x    +  x    +  x    +  x  +    x    x      x      x      c  the middle Term  o  or  x  ∞ will represent a Mathematical Point and + ∞  x  will represent an infinit Body and ∞  x infinit Space  +  x  a particular Body and  x  a particular Space and substituteing for + ∞  x    x  +  x  +  x  +  x  +  x    c  and for ∞  x    x    x    x    x    c  or what Number of unknown Quantities or howsoever compounded with their variable or constant Powers and treating them according to the Nature of their Composition in a given Expression by the common Rules of  Cossic  or  Arabic  Characters and rejecting all the  finite  Terms or those of a lower Order of such abstracted Infinits and reserving only  the  highest  Terms of the Expression and you will readily and intelligibly have all the  Mysteries  and solve all the  Problems  discovered by  Fluxions    Differentials  and  Series's  in  Numbers    Space    Time    Motion    Velocity  and  Bodies  and see that all this  mysterious  and admired  Play  of the Understanding is wholly about abstracted  Ideas  and the Modifications of  Body  and  Matter  which our narrow limited and finite Faculties not being able to apprehend and conceive distinctly in the Complex are forced to  parcel  out and divide thus into single intelligible Parts merely for their own Convenience and so is a mere  Technical  Art of the Understanding and Imagination to assist the  Memory  DEFINIT VI  RELATIVE Infinit  or Infinitude in Creatures whose Nature consists in being more or less respectively than any  assignable  Quantity whatever is such as increases or decreases perpetually yet by no finite Power can be actually brought to nothing and no finite Faculty can actually assign its  limiting  Terms  viz  the  greatest  and the  least  In this Sense it is that we suppose the least Particles of Bodies to be hard and indivisible that Body or Matter cannot be infinit that Matter is divisible  in Infinitum  that  Attraction  at a certain finite Distance becomes  Repulsion  that  positive  Quantities become  negative  in convergent  Progressions or from  negative  become  positive  in divergent Progressions which Progressions may be infinitly varied even to a created or relative Infinitude as Mathematicians know  DEFINIT VII  ABSOLUTE Infinitude  is the sole Property or Attribute of the  Deity  who is  infinitly Infinit  in all Excellencies and Realities which though infinitly various are at the same time infinitly  simple  and  one  This is evident from the  Simplicity  and  Unity  of his Nature as a true  Philosopher  must see  DEFINIT VIII  THINGS  are contradictory only which absolutley and totally destroy one another and mutually  annihilat  their Substance Subsistence and Qualities Thus it is in things created if  absolute Contradiction  can subsist in them Heat and Cold in the same Degree Light and Darkness in the same Degree  negative  and  positive  Terms of the same Progression finite and infinit of the same Kind But nothing seems to be so absolute a Contradiction as  necessary Existence  and  Nonentity  absolute  Nothing  and absolute  Infinitude  SCHOLIUM  IT is doubtful whether or not there can be any real and complete Contradiction between  created Substances Things and Qualities since they must all necessarily be  Pictures    Emblems  or  Miniatures  of the  Deity  and the divine Attributes Substance or Nature There seems to be necessary an  Energy    Action  and  Reaction  in the contradictory or totally annihilating Substances Things or Qualities as that between the good and evil Principle in the  Manichean System  between absolute Nothing and absolute Infinitude in the true  Philosophical System  between  Creation  and  Annihilation  For in all created Things Substances and Qualities there is  Subsistence  and Reality  Spiritual    Intellectual  or  Material  which cannot be annihilated or render'd totally contradictory but by the same  absolute Infinitude  by which they were created or ordain'd and infinit Perfection can at no future Time be contrary to itself  the Works of God are without Repentance  and  Reaction  always supposes  Action  In created Substances Things and Qualities there seems only to be a  Contrariety  that is a Contradiction or Annihilation of  some  of the Qualities and their respective Degrees Thus  material  and  spiritual  Substances may be contrary to one another but not contradictory being actually united and somehow ally'd in all intelligent Beings and having some Qualities  common  as actual  Existence  and a Power of intending and remitting their  Energy  or of  Expansion  and  Contraction  in their Substances and  Powers  analogous  to  Elasticity  in Bodies They must indeed have Limits and Bounds of their Activity and Selfmobility beyond which they can do nothing which Powers  Matter  seems design'd to terminat and counteract as Shadows die away in thick Darkness  Matter  may suspend contract and destroy the Action and Exertion of these  spiritual  Powers but cannot annihilat their  Substratum  nor destroy their  Root  or  Fund  for after their Concentration by Matter or Body they will still subsist in the  Substratum  either in  Root  or  Act  in a finite Magnitude or  infinitesimal Miniature  DEFINIT IX  ANALOGY  is a  Similarity  in Substances and essential Qualities differing only by a  More  or a  Less  or in Degrees  SCHOLIUM  ANALOGY  is of two kinds  simple  and  complex  that is perfect and complete or imperfect and incomplete  DEFINIT X  SIMPLE Analogy  is where there is a perfect and total  Similarity  of Substances and essential Qualities differing only in Degrees As that between a  lumbaginous Animalcul  a  seminal Embryo  a  Child  and a  Man  that between a  Seed  and a  Plant  Of this Nature are all the particular Answers to indetermin'd  Problems  in  Algebra  and all the particular  Curves  that answer the same Conditions in  Geometry  of which there is an infinit Variety  SCHOLIUM  THERE are I think  Substances  Things and Qualities of a  middle  Nature between the  Extremes  or the  greatest  and  least  of their Terms in every created Reality as between any two finite given Terms in Quantities there is an Infinity of  mean Proportionals  actual and assignable as between  x  and  y  there is the  Mean  and between  x  and  there is  and in a Circle of an infinit  Diameter  between any finite Part of the  Diameter  and the other infinit  Segment  there is the Perpendicular a mean  Proportional  which is neither infinitly  Small  nor infinitly  Great  I speak only of  relative  Infinitude and which I should call  Indefinit  so in Substances or  Substrata  of Qualities whether  Material  or  Spiritual  the two Terms or Limits some may approach or  verge  towards gross indiscerptible or imporose  Matter  or pure  Spirit  in all the Degrees of  relative  Infinitude which never can by any Power less than  absolutely  infinit arrive at either of the Extremes This in  Algebra  and  Geometry  is demonstrated and the absolute Infinitude Purity and Simplicity of the Divine Nature makes this Distinction necessary here  COROLLARY I  HENCE it will be reasonable to suppose that as  Matter  by its infinit possible Division Minuteness and Rarity by its Elasticity and Velocity may be sublim'd and refin'd into  relative  Infinitude so as to become as it were Sir  Isaac Newton  's  Spiritus quidam Subtilissimus  and meet only with an infinitly small Resistance in passing through gross and porous Bodies such as our  Planet  is so  spiritual  Substance may be  analogically  supposed to be capable of all the relative Degrees of Purity and Sublimity or Grossness and Density till it terminat in the lowest or highest  spiritual  Substance which yet will ever be contrary though not contradictory to  material  Substance  COROLLARY II  HENCE it will follow that this infinitly  refin'd  material Fluid of indefinit Rarity and Elasticity will meet with no sensible Resistance in passing through gross  planetary  Bodies yet its Parts being still  Material  and subject to the  Laws  of all material Bodies must at least meet with some  infinitesimal  Resistance and have some  Reaction  as the  Rays  of the  Sun  being Oceans of material Particles constantly emitted from his Body must necessarily lessen it though insensibly and infinitly little yet  really  so that neither of them can be design'd to last to an actual  Eternity in their present State they may be so alter'd on proper Occasions by the Power and Influence of Him who first created them as to answer the Ends of his wise Providence but cannot continue as they now are during all his  Eternity  DEFINIT XI  COMPLEX  or imperfect  Analogy  is where there is only a  Similarity  between a certain Number of essential Qualities that differ in Degrees and are diversified in other Qualities less essential as that between a  Man  and an  Angel  that between a  Man  and a  Brute  or that between a  Plant  and a  Brute  and the several  Ranks  and  Orders  of Being emerge as these Qualities increase and multiply  PROPOSITION  ALL  Creation  the whole  System  of the Universe    with all the particular  Systems  in Nature    all Beings animated and inanimat    all Substances    Qualities and Realities whatever    and every individual Circumstance in Nature    is nothing    and necessarily can be nothing    but the  Supreme Being  his  Nature  and  Attributes  transubstantiated into  Being  and Preceptibility    pourtray'd and shadow'd out and drawn forth  ad extra Mundus universus nihil est nisi Deus explicitus But the  Workman  will eternally be different in  Kind  from his  Work  the  Cause  from the  Effect  DEMONSTRATION  BEFORE  Creation    Omnipotence  itself could find no  Pattern  or  Model  for his Operations  ad extra  but Himself and his own Attributes or the  Ideas  of his own Mind which being infinitly perfect must necessarily have been the  best  and most eligible to imitat and copy out in his Productions and  Perfection  being  simple  and  one  by the Necessity of his own perfect Nature He could act outwardly no other way than by this  Analysis  and this is a Demonstration  a priori  from the  Cause  to the  Effect  if any thing can possibly be such and in  fact  it holds equally strong  a posteriori  so far as the wisest and bestcultivated human Spirits can reach or investigat takeing in the necessary  Conditions  and Circumstances as far as Experiment and Observation can discover which I intend to shew and illustrat in a few Instances  § THE  vegetable  World in its Variety Elegance and final Causes is a most astonishing Proof of God's  geometrical  Knowledge and Skill so to speak and fully shews what  Matter  the grossest and most unactive Substance can do when contriv'd and directed by his Wisdom and Power In  Plants  and  Vegetables  there seems to be no  spiritual  or selfmotive Power but only a  material  Spirit or such an one perhaps as Sir  Isaac Newton  's  Spiritus quidam subtilissimus  Here and in  material Agency  that Fluid seems necessary and the few Observations he has offer'd to infer its Necessity which the present Experiments and Discoveries about the Cause and Laws of  Electricity  and  Magnetism  wonderfully confirm are supported by its Implication here in  vegetable  Nature in order to explain the  Actuation    Growth  and  Increase  of  Plants  and  Minerals  all which vegetat and increase according to  general Laws  which no less Power than that of the  Author of Nature  could so wonderfully have contriv'd and perpetuated For though by Heat Moisture and  Attraction  from a  supramechanical  original Formation and Arrangement of the indivisible  Particles  of Matter or original Elements their future Progression Development and Multiplication may be now in the gross understood and explain'd yet the Cause of  Attraction  and  Elasticity  the first Impulse and motive  Energy  and the Continuance of these Powers and Activity can so probably be accounted for from no other  Principle  as this relatively infinitly  rare  and  elastic  Fluid the Size Figure and Laws of which could come only from this infinitly powerful and wise  Geometer  § THE totally inanimat Creation consisting either in the Fragments of the animated Parts or in the now aggregated or compounded  Moleculae  of the  primary Elements    shew and speak the Wisdom and Skill of their  Artificer  but more especially the  Systems  and Collections of these  elementary  original Particles  viz Air    Water    Light    Salts  and  Mercury  how proper their  Size    Figure  and  Laws  for the Uses and Ends proposed This  Speculation  would rapturously imploy the Eternity of a  sagacious  natural  Philosopher  Sir  Isaac Newton  has with great Penetration discover'd many hitherto unknown  Mysteries  and  Miracles  of Wisdom in the  Theory  of  Light  and  Colours  I will only suggest on the Head of this and the former  Proposition  that had it not been for the first Contrivance in the  Systems  of minute Particles now mention'd there could not possibly have been any proper Materials for the  Food    Growth  and  Increase  of the  Vegetables    Minerals  and  Metals  and had it not been for the Combination and Arrangement of the  Elements  into such middling integral Particles as are these of the  Vegetables  there could have been no proper and peculiar Food for the  Animals  the whole  System  being so disposed in a perpetual  Climax  that all its Parts mutually depend upon and are subservient to one another the  Tubes  of  Vegetables  being  mechanically  fitted and  harmoniously  adjusted to  mould  the Form the Size and combine these Elements into the middling nourishing integral Particles for the Food of Animals by the Solar Heat and the Laws of Attraction in minute Bodies  § IN  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings from the brute Creation through  Men  and  Angels  up to the  Seraphims  and  Cherubins  as far as  Creation  reaches the  Analogy  is plain simple and necessary The  three  natural Powers of  Liveing    Intelligence  and  Liberty  in their spiritual selfactive Principles cloath'd and circumscrib'd by  aethereal Vehicles  seem to be there in a perpetual  Climax  and differ only in Degrees The essential Difference between this and the  vegetable  and  mineral  Creation which are both of the same Order and Tribe and by the same vegetative Laws diversified under different Circumstances like the initial Terms of an  algebraic  Canon converging into the higher and more advanc'd Terms equally grow and increase seems to consist in the  selfmotive  and  selfactive  Powers of the former of which the  latter  is intirely destitute The  vegetable  Creation seems only to be actuated by the  Powers  of Matter and is consequently  inert  and  passive  and continue for ever in their Place and Situation unless forced from it by some external  Impulse  whereas the  brute  and animated Creation have a  selfmotive  Power so that  Vegetation  intirely depends upon the Powers of  Matter  and  Animation  in all its Degrees requires a  spiritual  Substance of some Rank or other And here the essential Difference between vegetable and animal Nature lies  viz  in the  locomotive  Power of the latter of which the former is destitute intirely and is merely  passive  But since the  brute  Creation in some Degree plainly manifests all the  Passions  and  Affections  of Mind that we of the  human  Race are capable of since they  live  or are actuated by a  selfmotive    selfactive  Principle since they  feel  Pleasure and Pain and may be at least most of them that fall under our Observation made to  learn  and  understand  some things which is a Proof that they are endow'd even with  Intelligence  in a lower Degree and since all of them from the minutest  microscopical Animalcul  up to the  Elephant  and  Whale  suffer and must necessarily suffer a Million of different ways here at last most intensely by their  Death  and Dissolution it is highly  probable  that they are in a  lapsed    expiatory  and  progressive  State of Being and may advance to higher Degrees of Perfection and Happiness like the  initial  Terms of a diverging  Progression  This the  Analogy  perspicuous and necessary in all the Works of infinit Wisdom and the various and manifold Operations of  God  's Power makes highly  probable  rational and  philosophical  Infinit Benevolence admits of no Stop or Bounds in its Communication of Being Happiness and Perfection but what arises from the Difference of the  Order  of  Nature  or of  Things  § As to us of the  human  Race our  original Powers  the Order Rank and present State of our spiritual Nature and selfmotive Substance with its original  aethereal  Vehicle at present cover'd over with a  Crust  of the Substance of the gross ruinous  Planet  we inhabit so much has been already said in the former Discourses that to avoid  Tautology  which I have perhaps run too much into I shall not come over the same Subject here  § THE  angelic Hierarchy  must in its own Nature and from our present  lapsed  State and Condition be absolutly unknown to us but in so far as  Revelation  or  philosophical Analogy  give us some dark  Hints  but such  Hints  they do give us as imply no Contradiction but on the contrary have a great Degree of  Probability  and Verisimilitude and naturally flow from the infinitly various Wisdom of the great Author and Cause of  Creation  We may err in the Detail but not in the general  Idea  about them We see what a Variety an infinit Variety of  Vegetables  and  Animals  in their several  Tribes  and  Species  He has produc'd and if we could possibly observe and class them taking in those we cannot discover but by the Help of  microscopical  Art we should find this Variety increase infinitly more in the  animated  than in the  vegetable  Creation rising in a certain  harmonious  Progression and Variety and which no Doubt is multiplied in the same Proportion in the  angelical  World For as things combin'd multiply or increase in the Number of their Qualities or their Degrees so do the  Combinations  possible and actual as is well known to  Mathematicians  The  Fixt Stars  with their  analogous  planetary  aethereal  pure and sublime  Systems  and  Apparatus  seem most probably to be the  Seats  of the unlapsed  angelical Hierarchies  and he that knows or has a dark Notion only of the  Number  of those already discover'd the  Number  of those hid in the  Milky Way  as it is called and the infinite  Extension  and  Expansion  of  Space  which in order to preserve the Situation Distance and  Equilibrium  of these  Orbs  must be filled with  analogous Luminaries  or  Systems  may have some Idea of the infinit  Number  and Variety of these  Hierarchies  They must all have some  generical  Nature as well as  specific  Differences This  generical  Nature may probably be no other than the  fundamental  and  essential  Attributes of the  Deity    viz Liveing    Understanding  and  Will  or  Father    Son  and  Holy Spirit  as has been  analogically  illustrated and which in gross solid Matter are shadow'd out in the  trine  Dimensions of Bodies Their  specific  Differences no finite Capacity can possibly assign or comprehend but there are two very eminent essential and  luminous  ones suggested to us from  Revelation    and confirm'd by  philosophical Analogy    viz  those of the distinguishing Characteristic of the  Son  and  Holy Spirit  St  John  says  God  is  Light  and in Him is no Darkness at all and in another Place he says  God  is  Love  and he that dwelleth in  God  dwelleth in  Love  That is the Divine Nature and Substance is  Light  and  Love  and accordingly the highest Orders of the  celestial Hierarchies  are eminently  Light  and  Love  or they are infinitly  Luminous  or infinitly  Ardent  which two Qualities make the  Characteristic  of the  Cherubims  and  Seraphims  as their  Names  import and these two Attributes of the Divine Nature seem to pass variously and in different Degrees and  Gradations  through all Creation down to inanimat Nature and in each Individual they are both radically and actually existent but in different Degrees according to their several  Orders Existence  or  Liveing  is common to all created Beings which is an analogous  Participation    Picture  or  Image  of the  Father  and Creator  by whom are all things  Some Bodies are nothing but  light  luminous and transparent as  Fire    sulphurous  Bodies and all  minute  Bodies violently agitated or put into brisk  vibrating  Motions and every Body  shredded  sufficiently thin becomes  diaphanous  and all Bodies whatever  reflect  or  refract  Light Some Bodies again are more or less  attractive  as  Salts    Oils  and  Sulphurs  and some at certain Distances less  than infinite are  repulsive  which is a flagrant Picture of Lapse Corruption and Rebellion in  spiritual  Nature All these Qualities have their  analogous  and correspondent Powers in  spiritual  Nature which to a  Philosopher  of any Penetration were superfluous to detail For in  spiritual  Beings and intelligent Natures these two Qualities and their higher Degrees in some more than in others are so conspicuous that they cannot be overlooked In all  Founders  of  Republics  and  Civil Societies  in all  Lawgivers  and  Philosophers  in all  Apostolical  Men in the  Inventers  of Arts and Sciences even in the Broachers of  Heresies  this Quality of  Light  however coarse turbid and confin'd seems to have been their  Passion  their  Fort  their  Characteristic  and overruling  Byass  and in all the  Hermetical  Tribe the  Solitaries  the true contemplative  Philosophers  the Founders of  Orders    Monasteries  and  Collegiat  Life in true and zealous  Patriots  and Lovers of their Country and  Species  in short in all the  contemplative  and abstracted Persons  Love  seems to be the  predominant  Affection and this Division runs through all even corrupt and lapsed Nature and makes the great  Distinction  of Mankind into the  Governed  and  Governing  those who defend Truth and those who attack Error those who  thrust  and hit the Mark best  ie  the Lawgivers or their Makers and those who  parry  best  ie Politicians  and honest  Statesmen  those fitted by Nature to  command  and those that are made only to be  commanded  and obedient that is all the  active  and  social  or the  Children of Men  and the  Sons of God  or the Thinking and  Contemplative  But this Difference is with infinit Variety great Imperfections foreign Mixtures and  diabolical  Influences in corrupt Nature but never the one in any eminent Degree without some Degree of the other as they are both united to  Infinitude  in their divine  Original  and  Cause  and these Differences make up the  Specification  and  Individuation  of the several Particulars of  lapsed  free and intelligent Nature and the Difference of the Conduct of  Divine  Wisdom in their Purification and Restoration who with infinit Wisdom and  Propriety  conducts all and each without  Violence  on their Freedom and specific Qualities or  Dissonance  to the  Harmony  of his own Attributes to their great and  final  End of Being which is the wonderful  Oeconomy  of the general and particular  Restoration  and this Difference and Distinction of the original Qualities and Affections of the Soul  viz Light  and  Love  and the different  Manoeuvre  and Conduct of Providence in this State towards them is founded on the different Parts they might have acted in the general  Lapse  of Mankind and the different  Offices  Seats and  Mansions  they are to be prepar'd for in the universal Monarchy of the  Restoration  and may make the otherwise  unaccountable  Difference of the  Bodies    Spirits    Tempers    Capacities  and outward and inward Success in this State of two Children of the same Birth as  Twins  or two immediately succeeding one another of the same Parents under the same Education and Beginnings in the World and on the same Bottom which every one must have observ'd to be as various different and distant as the  Poles  and in a manner  diametrically  opposite even otherwise unaccountable and odd  § THAT the  fixt Stars  and their analogous  planetary satellitious  sublimer  aethereal Systems  may possibly be the  Seats  and  Mansions  of the  unlapsed    tried  and  purified angelical Hierarchies  and of restor'd purified and glorified  sentient  and  intelligent  mortal Beings seems not only probable  philosophical  and according to the general  Analogy  of Things but is strongly and frequently hinted in  Revelation  as every one who is familiarly acquainted with it must know  God  's Throne his  Shechinah  the Heaven of Heavens his Dwellingplace is always represented  above Elijah  went upwards  Christ  ascended and the Seats of the blessed are always represented as among these celestial  Orbits  And though  Analogy  may not  apodeictically  demonstrate a  Fact  or  Truth  especially as to its  precise  and  specific  Nature and secondary Qualities in the Detail about  imperceptible  and  spiritual  Beings precise  Truth in these Matters being not only incompatible with  Finitude  but counteracting  Faith    Trust  and  Resignation  the sole Means of our Recovery and progressive Purification being absolutely destructive of  Liberty  and clashing with the  Divine  Attributes of infinit Justice and Purity and his absolut Dominion over the Creation yet when  Analogy  and  Revelation  concur in the same general Conclusion it is so high a Presumption and Probability as comes nearest a  Demonstration  at least to those who have any Regard for Revelation for to such it will be selfevident that infinit Wisdom and absolut Infallibility will never make the most distinct Approach to any  Allusion  or Similitude that borders on things in no Degree of Alliance  Approximation  or Neighbourhood or where the  Contact  is not as near as Circumstances will admit or that is not as the first Terms of a convergeing  Progression  or  one  that will lead his low wandering blundering Creatures into gross Mistakes that Bodies or Vehicles of spiritual Substances must have an  Ubi  a  local  permanent Situation at last is certain that these numberless glorious  Luminaries  were lighted up with such a Profusion of  Lustre  only for us stupidly to gaze at is ridiculous That they must be infinit in their Number I mean always creaturely relative  Infinitude  follows from the infinit Expansion of  Space  and the  Equilibrium  necessarily to be preserved in order to perpetuat the Situation Distance and Relations of these glorious  Luminaries  That they may be of an infinitly purer more refin'd and sublim'd Matter than even that of our  Sun  who was design'd grosly only to picture out the Divine Nature to us  lapsed  Mortals and to enlighten and cherish us a little and our dark Prison during our  Probation  and  Recovery  and not made for Perpetuity and which is cover'd over and compress'd with a gross dense  Atmosphere  with  Maculae  and  Spots  that possibly may hinder its too quick and violent Consumption is highly probable These  fixt  and permanent  Luminaries  with their analogical  planetary Apparatus  may be the Seats of the  Bless'd  whose glorious  Vehicles  may be of the same Matter and Substance with their respective  Mansions  These  aethereal Planets  and  fixt Stars  may be so situated and so  harmoniously  plac'd in regard to one another that the Rays and as it were spiritual or  aethereal  Matter which they perpetually pour forth and emit through the whole  Expansion  of Space may by a perpetual  Flux  and  Reflux  and  melodious Vibrations  be return'd back again upon one another and so perpetuat and  eternise  their  Lustre  and  Glory  The Rays of our Sun have Fits of easy  Transmission    Refraction  and  Reflexion  according to Sir  Isaac Newton  its Particles have a greater  Byass  on the  one  Side than on the  other  they attract one another in an infinitly greater Proportion than their Power of  Gravity  in general  Bodies  may  be turn'd into  Light  and  Light  into  Bodies  Some  Diamonds  and precious Stones are  luminous  emit Light and shine in the Dark Several  Phosphors  liquid and solid emit Light at all Times both in  Air  and  Water  and the  Asbestos  and purest  Gold  bear all Degrees of Heat and Fire without much Alteration and the purest Glass in the  Focus  of the strongest  Specula  only continues liquid without any other Change These  Facts  I suggest only to shew that Light as well as other Bodies may be various of different Purity and Sublimity differing in  Degree  though not in  Kind  and much more might be suggested here to shew the various Nature and different Qualities of  Light  and luminous Bodies one from another if necessary to illustrat this perhaps  imaginary  Speculation at least save it free from Contradiction or Impossibility but I propose in this mere  Conjecture  § THAT  infinit Wisdom    Power  and  Love  could produce no  sentient  or  intelligent  Being  ad extra  without impressing in the  Fund  and Essence of its Nature an infinit  Love  to Him an insatiable and unextinguishable Desire Thirst and  Ardour  to be  reunited  at last with Him as its supreme Felicity is as  absurd  and I think  blasphemous  to doubt as to doubt of his  Being  and Existence To think otherwise is to question his  infinit Perfection  for  infinit Perfection  must be  single  and  one  and sentient and intelligent Beings without this radical and innate  Ardor  for  Happiness  that is to be at last united and to commerciat with infinit Perfection seeing by the  Sensibility  and  Intelligence  of their Nature they are capable of it in their Order would be an  Effect  without a  Cause  or an  Action  without an  End  or  Purpose  at least without intending the selfevident  best  End which is a Contradiction the most absolut to infinit Perfection No  sentient  and  intelligent  Being ever was without an  Ardor  or Bent towards  Happiness  it is a  radical  Principle in their Nature and never counteracted though its Nature and true Cause is often mistaken may be unknown or forgot yet it can  finally  consist only in this  Reunion  But Sensibility and Intelligence being by their Nature and Essence  free  must be  labile  and by their  Lability  may actually  lapse  degenerat and by Habit acquire a  second Nature  opposit and contrary to this implanted  Brass  and Tendency towards a  Reunion  and permanent  Commerce  with their original and  first Cause  and by  Selfishness  inordinat Love and Idolatry of their  FellowCreatures  sopit and extinguish this central  Byass  at least as to  elicit Acts  though not in the  Root  and  Fund  And in this  Contrariety    Distraction  and tearing asunder of these  moral Powers  in  spiritual Nature  the Essence of  Misery  and  Hell  itself chiefly consists So long as this contrary habitual and foreign  Byass  lasts so long must  the  Unhappiness  and  Tortures  of such  sentient  and  intelligent  Creatures continue like the  Chill  and  Cold  in the  Comets  while in the Parts of their  Orbit  most distant from the  Sun  or like the small  Particles  of Matter which out of the  Sphere  of their  Attraction  become  repulsive  and by the Law of their  Passivity  continuing ever in the  State  into which they are put must for ever proceed in this their  repulsive  Course But this contrary  Byass  to  Reunion  with their infinitly perfect and happy  Original  being  adventitious  only and by  Habit  only confirm'd into a  second  artificial  Nature  the infinit  Love    Wisdom  and  Oeconomy  of the  Son  of  God  was contriv'd and design'd to melt down  annihilat  and destroy that the original innate  Byass  might operate and take Place and without this infinitly wise  Oeconomy  to me it seems the permanent Order Peace and  Harmony  and consequent  Felicity  of universal sentient and intelligent Nature could no other possible way have been or be establish'd at last  § IT is not impossible but extremely probable and according to the universal  Analogy  of Nature that our  Planets  and their  Satellites  should be the more tolerable  Jails    Prisons  and  Dungeons  of the several  Orders  and  Degrees  of  lapsed    probationary    sentient  and  intelligent  Beings That some of them are straiter less comfortable more dark dismal  and unhappy than others there is no doubt can be made That they are not nor cannot be design'd for an  eternal  Duration in their present Condition is highly probable We see on this our  Planet  that the Bodies Tempers and Habitudes of  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings that continue long in such particular  Climats  and under such Influences of the Celestial Bodies alter and take a  Turn  according to the general Laws and Temperature of that  Climat  The  Planets  and their  Satellites  have an infinit  Propriety  and Fitness for being more tolerable  Bettering  and  CorrectionHouses  and Prisons for lapsed sentient and intelligent Beings They are no ways nor cannot become in their present Situation  PleasureHouses  Paradises and happy  Mansions  nor permanent DwellingPlaces for perfect and glorified Intelligences The  natural  Language of the  Deity  to us in our present Condition can be no other but by  Types    Similitudes    Allusions    Parables    Allegories    Analogy  and  final Causes  without Violence on our  Liberty  our Acquisition of  Faith    Hope  and  Charity  or debasing his own infinit Purity and Perfection at least about invisible and imperceptible Beings and States under our present  Lapse  and therefore I conjecture that our  Planets  and their  Satellites  are design'd by infinit Wisdom for the temporary  Jails  and  CorrectionHouses  of  lapsed  probationary  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings and that their  superinduc'd Vehicles or other  penal  and  penitential  Habits are of the same Substance and Materials with the respective  Prisons  they are confin'd to  § THAT the  Comets  cannot be the  Seats  of blessed Spirits I think is selfevident That they are not made only to supply our  Planet  the  Earth  or even all the other  Planets  with  Moisture  and  Humidity  only is as evident The  Number  of them perhaps half a dozen in a  Century  that have been observ'd and seen and of which we have some Records with their sensible Effects Appearances and  Periods  are abundantly too  many  for that  farfetch'd  and  precarious  Purpose only Our  Water  most certainly decreases and must necessarily be exhausted in time as do the  Heat  and  Rays  of the  Sun  but not so sensibly as to lay a Foundation for Experience and Observation by our Senses or Art But rather to increase our sensible Punishment and natural Purification at the last Stage And it is highly reasonable and  philosophical  to suppose that our whole  System  was design'd by our  Creator  to last in its present Situation only so long as was requir'd for the  Probation    Purification  and  Expiation  of lapsed  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings which both  Revelation  and  Philosophy  shew cannot be an  infinit Duration  but that the whole  planetary System  within the  Orbit  of  Saturn  is progressively  and by  general Laws  verging towards some grand  Catastrophe  and  JailDeliverance  The  Elect  seems to imply the  Officers  and  Governors  of this  new Jerusalem  this  political  future State this universal  Restoration Monarchy  of the  Father of all  and the  Period  of the Duration of this present  probatory  State of the  System  of  Saturn  seems confin'd and limited in  Revelation  to the Number of the  Elect  's being accomplished that is to the Time when all the necessary  Officers    Governors  or  Magistrates  of this  new  universal Government is formed finished and accompleated and then will be the End  Crisis  and  Period  of this  probatory  State I say then the  Comets  cannot be the Seats of the Bless'd if Alterations of Heat and Cold  Summer  and  Winter  in some more temperat and moderat Degree be necessary for tolerable liveing in Bodies  crusted  over with the Substance of which the  Habitation  is made as it is  philosophical  to think of the Inhabitants of the  Comets  seeing their  Orbits  are so  excentric  to the  Sun  the  Foci  of their  Ellipses  so vastly distant that they must pass for Ages through both Extremes of Heat and Cold and be perpetually involv'd either in  Fire  or  Darkness  and so in extreme Misery as to their incrusted  Machins  and consequently they probably are the  Prisons    Condemn'dHoles  and Dungeons of  God  's  Kingdom  and universal  Monarchy  § IT is both  rational  and  philosophical  and according to the natural  Analogy  of Things to suppose that the  next  World or its several Steps of Progression and its initial Steps or first Terms and the invisible impreceptible State of  Things  in the  other Life  has a great and near Similitude and Resemblance to this present State and that they differ chiefly in  Degrees  the  other World  being of an infinitly greater Purity Sublimity and Perfection only without the  Errors    Darkness  or  Miseries  of this Life  God is the same Yesterday    Today    and for Ever  immutable and invariable in his Nature and Attributes and as has been often hinted all his Works  ad extra  and the Operations of his Wisdom and Power have a perpetual ascending  Analogy  and Progression towards Him his Nature and Felicity It is true  Revelation  informs that  Eye hath not seen    Ear hath not heard    nor hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive the Glory and Happiness that God has reserved in another Life for them that love Him  But as that refers chiefly to the inward Joy and Happiness  Extasies  and  Transports  that the consummatly Bless'd feel in their Commerce and  final Union  with  Him  their infinitly perfect Source and Original so it does not affect their outward  State  their  Polity  external Order and  Mansions  of which only I am here speaking and of which the Description and Account  by  Revelation  intimats plainly a great  Affinity  with the most perfect and happy Condition of our  now  World and it is highly probable they differ more in  Degrees  of Perfection than in  Kind  The  new Jerusalem  is liken'd to a City a State and  Republic  it has its People Subjects and Officers it has  Temples    paradisaical Gardens    Rivers of Pleasure  a  perpetual Spring  and all our best and most  beatifying  Delights and material Comforts here I know all this Language and Description is but  Allusion    Figure  and  Allegory  and must be understood chiefly of our  Creation  or  glorified  Bodies but as every created Being  sentient  and  intelligent  has a Body or Vehicle as well as Spirit an  aethereal  planetary or a glorified  Vehicle  the last inseparable and immortal as well as a  spiritual selfmotive  Substance the Body or glorified  Vehicle  may have  analogical  Food some Fruit of the  Tree of Life  which in  Paradise  itself perpetuated the  Immortality  of and would have  eternis'd  the  Creation Vehicle  it must have an  Ubi  a  Mansion  and DwellingPlace it must have  analogous  Pleasures of an innocent spiritual and sublimer Nature proper to its Order and Rank and proportion'd to the Purity of its then  Body  and  Soul  there must be different  Orders    Ranks  and  Distinctions  superior Officers and Subalterns a  Government  and  Polity  in the  new  as well as in the  old Jerusalem  In short they will probably differ not  in  Kind  or absolute and total Contradiction from the best and most perfect State of Things here that can be imagin'd or describ'd at least in the first Steps or Terms in the progressive  Perfection  and  Happiness  but in Degrees and in  Negation  of all that is imperfect  dissonant  and disorderly in this  present State  but this in an  infinit  that is a relative or creaturely  infinit  superior Degree and into the  final  consummat and perfectest State we must mount only by  Degrees  and  Steps  through many  Mansions  and progressive  Order  and by acquireing an habitual  Stability  by repeated  Acts  and  Trials  be confirm'd in eternal Purity and Felicity at last and one  Stage  of Being will be perhaps but an  Apprenticeship  and probatory Initiation for a higher and better and this without Bounds and without Limits I mean only as to the bodily  Restoration Vehicle  its  Mansion    Food  created Pleasures and Enjoyments which can only flow from the Fund the spiritual Inhabitant's being restor'd and perfectly united with and transform'd into the  Divine Nature  and Qualities This  System  modestly explain'd and cautiously guarded in the Proportion of  Perfect  to  Imperfect    Infinit  to  Finite  Innocent to Lapsed would I think take off many Difficulties in  Revelation  in the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  and the  Restoration  the different Methods of Providence and its present Appearances and our Mistakes  of the  Sentiments  and Writings of  inspir'd  Authors For it is impossible the Spirit of God should insinuat any  Resemblance  Alliance or  analogical  Similitude between things that differ  generically  were  disparata  and incompatible but between such as were verging by Progression and in an  Approximation  to the real Perfection of their Natures Lapsed Beings are infinitly distant at present from such a  final Union  and relative  Identity  with their Source and his  Throne  and  Shechinah  But must be like the  Assymptots  of  Hyperbola's  and their  Curves  eternally approaching to but never able totally to coincide  §  ANALOGY  'tis true can never demonstrat the actual Existence and real Being of any thing to us  Sensation  only and Experience can do that It is only capable of explaining and illustrating the Nature Substance and Qualities of Things already made and created It is as  Quintilian  very elegantly describes Analogy  Ejus haec vis est    ut id quod dubium est    ad aliquod simile    de quo non quaeritur    referat    ut incerta certis probet  But then it takes off any Contradiction and Impossibility from its  Existence  makes it possible probable and rational and renders it a fit Subject for the  supreme Reason  and  Power  to work upon if He pleases and  similar  to his other Operations it clears all possible Objections  and  Difficulties  and makes it natural and intelligible and that is precisely what our present Condition and Situation requires or will admit for the Acquisition of the  moral Powers    Faith    Hope  and  Charity  to secure our  Liberty  from  Violence  and the  Divine Attributes  from  Dissonance  And if the fundamental  Proposition  be admitted  viz  that all the Works of infinit Wisdom and Power  ad extra  are and can be nothing but Pictures Resemblances and Signatures of  God  's  Nature    Substance  and  Attributes  in  Miniature    impress'd  or  prominent  In a word if it be true as has been said that  Mundus universus nihil est nisi Deus explicitus  and I think nothing can be more selfevident then most of the Consequences I have drawn from this great Truth are necessary natural and obvious especially when Revelation suggests the same Truths and Conclusions at least in general We may very readily err in the  Detail  and in the Eliciting and Application of a particular Case but not so readily in the  general  Law as is common with  Algebraists  they often blunder in the Application who were in the Right in the  Canon  § WE may blunder and be mistaken in our particular Conclusions and Deductions from this universal  Analogy  I say as well as in  Geometry  and  Algebra  being weak fallible and imperfect Creatures But our Errors and  Blunders in the  first  will sometimes proceed from a different Cause from our Mistakes in the  latter  A wrong Head want of Culture and  Precipitation  are generally the Cause of our Mistakes in  Geometry  and  Algebra  but in  Analogy  especially that  Analogy  which concerns the moral Attributes of the Divine Nature the  human  Soul the  holy Scriptures  and invisible States it is owing often to a wrong  Heart    Pride  and Selfsufficiency We are afraid such pure and sublime  Theorems  should be true they hint the  Necessity  of a greater Purity in us than we are willing to cultivat at present If we ascribed all Perfection every  good Gift  and  perfect Donation  to the supreme Cause and were at the same time humbled and contented even with our own Ignorance Errors and Blunders of  Love  and  Resignation  only if our Sentiments and  Ratiocination  were intended for his  Glory  and  Magnificence  solely and our own Humiliation satisfied with this single Truth alone that God is  God  that is infinitly  perfect  they could neither hurt us nor others But if our Heads must needs be at work as mine has here if like Children we must play with  Ideas  and  philosophise  about the Kingdom of  Invisibles  and  Imperceptibles  and the  Arcana Imperii divini  if we cannot at first at least and in our Years of  Probation  or  elementary  State arrive  per saltum  at  pure Love    naked Faith  and  universal Resignation  the only solid Means of  Infallibility and Stability then the best and surest Method is to deal in  Analogy  as the  Mathematicians  do in  Algebra  and  Geometry  to acquire a Facility in solving difficult  Problems  with Readiness and Accuracy  viz  by laying up in our  Memory  or having ready at hand a  Penus Analogica  as they have a  Penus Analytica  in beginning with the most  simple  and least complicated  Analogies  in attentively observing the  Ratio's  Relations and References of Things Substances their Qualities and probable  final Causes  and finding out their Degrees and Progression The  Astronomers  had with Exactness and Accuracy discover'd and settled the  Orbit    Period    Distance  and Laws of the  Sun  and  Earth  before they attempted with any Success that of the  Moon  and Sir  Isaac Newton  had settled and adjusted the Laws Motions and Appearances of the  Solar System  before he attempted the  Moon  and  Planets  and had for seven Years studied experimental  Chymistry  before he set about to investigat the Nature and Laws of minute Bodies and their  Systems  he had cultivated and made many and various Experiments by separating combining and  analysing  the  Rays  of  Light  through many  diaphanous  Mediums before he attempted to discover the Nature Figure and Laws of their component Particles  Analogy  and its Appendages  Type    Allusion    Similitude    Parable    Hieroglyphic  and  Allegory  all more remote or nearer Approaches to  Analogy  is the only natural Language the  Deity  can speak to us at present under our Degeneracy and  Lapse  consistent with his  Dignity  and  Purity  and the Preservation of our  Liberty  He may speak to us mediatly by his  Angels  He may speak to the Wills by his  Holy Spirit  and to our  Understandings  by his  Word  his only begotten  Son  and in the holy Scriptures by his  Prophets    Apostles  and  Saints  but his sole  natural  articulat indelible and universal Language can possibly be no other but his Works of Wonder  ad extra The Heavens declare the Glory of God  By the Characters and  Hieroglyphics  intimatly impress'd on them and they can only be read or understood by  Analogy  to  Him  to  us  and to  one another  If then we began with this inanimat World in which only true natural  Philosophy  from final Causes can instruct us thence proceeded to the  vegetable  World then advanc'd to the  brute  Creation where  natural  History and  Chymistry  will be of great Service and at last ascended to  intelligent  Beings through the  angelic Hierarchy  till by  Analogy  we arriv'd at the  Supreme Cause  this Method would be the most natural and secure in a  natural Progression  by  Analogy  And if with Humility Modesty and begging the Direction of the  uncreated  Wisdom we persever'd with Patience this divine  Philosophy  might in time cultivated by different Hands be of Service to the  contemplative  Christian Philosopher  himself as well as to others But my Meaning will be better understood by a short  Recapitalation  of what has been said and an  Illustration  by an Example  WHEN God intended to bring Creatures into Being He could not chuse but make them after the most perfect Pattern He therefore stamp'd his own  Image  upon all his Works Hence the Creatures being all  Miniatures  of the Deity must bear a mutual Resemblance to Him and to one another This  Resemblance  is what we call  Analogy  and runs through the whole  Scale  of  Beings  every  Being  besides its  peculiar  and distinguishing Quality whereby it is determin'd to this or that particular  Order  and has the  Preeminence  of all below it being also possess'd of all those Qualities that are to be found in any of the inferior  Orders  As a  Curve  of any of the  Orders  has all the Properties of the inferior Orders of  Curves  besides those that belong to its own Class or  Species  THESE different  Orders  or Ranks of Beings being distinguish'd by their respective Qualities the  first Term  of this infinit  Scale  will be simple  Existence  the Addition of  one  Quality will constitute the  second Term  or  Order  of  two  the  third  and so of the rest whence the Number of Qualities with which  any Being is endow'd will determin its Place in this  Scale  and shew its Distance from the  first Term  Besides this Difference in the several  Orders  of Beings there is also a Diversity among those of the same  Order  which proceeds from their possessing some of the common Qualities in a more or less eminent Degree  As  God  can have but one  Model  in all his Productions every  System  of Beings will resemble all the other  Systems  and each will be a Copy of the whole  Creation  The  material  World will be a Transcript of the  spiritual  and the  Laws  and  Oeconomy  of the  one  will be analogous to and correspond with those of the  other  Besides this general  Analogy  there will be a more immediat and flagrant Relation between each  material System  and the Intelligences to which it belongs the Structure of the Bodies and other material  Organs  of these Intelligences together with the whole Frame and Contexture of the material  System  being such as will best suit the Nature Rank and  Order  of these  Intelligences  And this Relation probably will subsist and attend them in all the Changes and  Periods  through which they pass so that should the intelligent  System lapse  from its Purity and Perfection the material  System  would fall into Disorder likewise and undergo some  similar  and  analogous  Change  OF this general  Analogy  between the  spiritual  and  material Systems  there are many  Traces  plainly to be discern'd by an acute and  contemplative Philosopher  To instance only in the Similitude which our  solar System  as now disorder'd bears to the  lapsed Intelligences  that inhabit it In the Centre of this  System  is plac'd the  Sun  a bright and lively Image of the  Deity  his material inanimat  Miniature  the  Planets  and other  celestial Orbs  revolving about him at their respective Distances and performing their Revolutions in different  Periods  of Time will represent the several  Orders  of lapsed Intelligences the different Degrees of their  Lapse  and the Duration and Continuance of their  probatory  State This glorious Body the  Sun  infinitly surpasses all the other  Orbs  in Magnitude and Lustre they are no more compar'd to him than Points in the  Circumference  of a  Circle  They have no Brightness of their own it is all deriv'd by  Reflection  and is more or less according to their Distance from him  THE chief Properties of the  Sun  are  Attraction    Light  and  Heat  The  Sun  's  Attraction  extends to the remotest Parts of the  System  acting at all Distances with a  Force  increasing in a certain Proportion as these Distances decrease 'Tis by this  Attraction  that the  Planets  are retain'd in their  Orbits  and kept from flying off in the  Tangent  to which their  projectile  Force gives them a constant Tendency Should the  Sun  's  Attraction  cease but a Moment the whole  System  would fall into the utmost Disorder and be irrecoverably ruin'd How like is this  Attraction  to the  Love  of  God  continually operating upon all created  Intelligences  and powerfully solliciting them to a nearer Approach and Resemblance to Himself Its Influence is constant and invariable were it possible it should have the least Intermission the whole  Creation  would fall into utter Ruin and Destruction  THE  Light  of the  Sun  is diffus'd throughout the whole  System  no  Celestial  Body is endow'd with this Quality but himself This is an  Image  of that  Light which enlightens every Man that comes into the World  an  Emblem  of Him who came forth from the  Father of Lights  the  Light  and  Sun  of the new  Jerusalem  and of  spiritual Nature  THE  Sun  's Light is always accompanied with Heat the Principle of  Life  and  Vegetation  In the other celestial Bodies there is some small Degree of this Quality but it is originally deriv'd from or produc'd in them by the  solar Heat  without which they would be barren and inhospitable  Desarts  This  represents the Influences of the  Holy Spirit  which are inseparable from the  Light  of the  Gospel  and are the Principle of our  spiritual Life  animating and cherishing every intelligent Being and making it productive of all the Fruits of Righteousness  LET us next consider the Properties of the  Planets  and other Bodies that revolve about the  Sun  Their various  Magnitudes  and  Distances  from the  Sun  with the  periodical  Times of their Revolution will express the several  Orders  of  lapsed Intelligences  the different Degrees of their  Lapse  and the particular  Periods  of Time allotted for their Trial and  Probation  Some of these Bodies as the  Comets  move in  Orbits  that are very  Ellyptical  going off to immense Distances from the  Sun  where the Influence of his  Heat  and  Light  is almost insensible but by the Force of his  Attraction  they are again drawn back and brought even to a nearer Approach than other Bodies that move in narrower  Orbits  THE  Planets  are constantly acted upon by two different Forces  viz Gravity  or  Attraction  and the  projectile  Force These are contrary to one another and always act in opposite Directions the  projectile  Force giveing the  Planet  a constant Tendency to recede from the  Sun  and to fly off in the  Tangent    while the Force of  Attraction  by drawing it the contrary way prevents that Effect So that by the joint Action of both the  Planet  is kept in its  Orbit  The  attractive  Force though continually influencing the  Planet  is not a Quality of it but proceeds from the  Sun  the only Quality belonging to the  Planet  is that of the  projectile  Force This will shadow out the  Lapse  the Action of  Selfishness  and the inordinate  Love  of the Creature with their Opposition to the  divine Love  PHILOSOPHERS  tell us that the present State of our  System  cannot be of long Continuance but that the  solar Attraction  must necessarily prevail over the  projectile  Force of the  celestial  Bodies and all the  Comets  and  Planets  with their  Satellites  be at last  absorb'd  and  swallow'd  up in the  Sun  FINIS  AN ABSTRACT Or A Brief but Distinct REPRESENTATION OF THE  Doctrines  and  Sentiments  Contained in the preceding DISCOURSES  AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE I  PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES about the Nature and Qualities of the  Original Animal Body  and of its Progressive State in its several Stages of Existence  THAT there may be  Animals  and consequently animal  Organs  performing  analogically  at least the animal  Functions  less than our Senses can discover assisted by our best  Art  possibly less than our Imagination can frame an Idea of  Page    Several  Demonstrations  shewing the utter  Impossibility  that an  animal  Body could be first form'd or can be now continued by  mere Mechanism or the Laws of Nature now obtaining but must be the immediat Work continued and supported by the constant Influence of an omnipotent and omniscient  First Cause    That the  least  and  last  Particles of Matter can be divided by no finite Power whatever  That their  Figures  were probably at first only  Spheres    Cubes  and  equilateral triangular Prisms  ibid  That our now porous and confus'd  Elements    Salts    Water    Light    Air  and  Earth  still have  inherent  Qualities which distinguish them from each other which they never totally lose tho' these may be swallow'd up when combin'd  unharmoniously  as they now are  That the original  Creation  and the  Resurrection  Body might have been and may be of this first kind of simple  Elements    harmoniously  combin'd but are now crusted over and  discordantly  blended with the gross secondary Elements of this  ruinous Planet  we inhabit  That the Fineness of the original  aethereal  animal Body may have been in  Proportion  to its  Order  and the Perfection of the natural and moral Powers of the  Soul  conjunctly  That this  analogically    spiritual  so to speak animal Body might have been  roll'd  up  and  concentred  into a  Miniature  of a  Miniature in Infinitum  in the Loins of the  first Adamical Parent  till by its being sufficiently plaister'd over with the Matter of this ruinous  Planet  it became able to bear its now  Inclemency  and be born into this World  That this  primitive    aethereal  divinely  organiz'd Body  by an  individual Fitness  and Congruity to the informing spiritual Substance might have been thereby so intimatly and  commensuratly  united with it that they could never after be separated by any finite Power no more than the  original Particles  of Matter could be divided by such a Power ibid  That the confineing this original  spiritual  Body and  Soul  so long a Time to so dark a Prison as the  Seeds  and  Eggs  of Animals are now might have been for  progressive Purification    Correction  and  Punishment    That it is  Fact  that the  wisest  and  best  Men have been at first mere  Vegetables  afterwards mere  Brutes  and but at last  rational  intelligent Beings  That  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings are by their  derivative  Nature immortal and unannihilable and because  God  can never be contrary to Himself but are in a  progressive  State towards Perfection and Happiness in their Order like the several Orders of  Hyperboloids    That the  natural  Powers being uniformly constant and invariable and the  moral  Powers being cancell'd by the  Lapse  had not the  natural  Powers in their full Vigour been suspended and fetter'd they must have  counteracted  the Acquisition of the  moral  Powers  That  precise  Knowledge and  mathematical  Certainty in the real Nature and of the intimat Substance of any complex Thing is incompatible with  Finitude  and that the  Degree  of Certainty in Things is only in Proportion to the  Amplitude  of the Faculty  That subjecting all Creation to  general Laws  was one infinitly wise and effectual  Mean  to secure  Liberty  inviolate and to  harmonize  the Divine Attributes in the great Work of Restoration  That the only thing worthy of a  Philosopher  is by  Experiment    Attention  and  Induction  to collect as many of these  general Laws  as he possibly can  That God being  Simple    One  and always the same must necessarily act by  general Laws  in all  Creation  but that good and wise Men have been deterr'd from studying them in  spiritual Nature  out of Dread of the odious Appellation of  Enthusiasts    That the Study of these  general Laws  of infinit Wisdom and Sagacity may be a Part  of the Employment of happy  contemplative Spirits  hereafter  That an infinitly rational and perfect Being could possibly have no other  Pattern  or  Model  for his Works of Creation at first but  himself  his own  Substance    Nature  and  Attributes    That therefore there must be one perpetual  Analogy  and  progressive Perfection  running through all the Works of an infinitly  rational  Being and that as  Proportion  is the  Key  of the material  Analogy  is the  Logic  of the  spiritual  World  That  Suffering  is a  mechanical  and necessary Consequence of our present  Situation  on this  ruinous Globe  and that none ever could avoid it absolutly but in Degree and that thro' the Merits and  OEconomy  of  Jesus  only  Sufferings  become  Blessings  because Means of Restoration  That this  Suffering  is a natural and  mechanical  Purification and Perfection of the  Subject    That  Consciousness  of the  End  or Occasion of this  Suffering  is no way necessary towards the beneficial Effects of it That Consciousness would be prejudicial in the  first  Steps of this Purification and only when its  End  is obtain'd can it be beneficial to  clench  its Effects  That the great  Problem  and Difficulty with the  Best of Beings  so to speak and in the  Oeconomy  of his Providence and the Reason of the present Darkness in it is to restore  lapsed  Creatures in Consistence with their  Liberties  and the  Harmony  of his  Divine Attributes    That the general Methods of Providence in restoreing lapsed Intelligences are plainly The continuing  general Laws  The suspending the  elicit  Acts of the natural Powers for a Time by Ligatures of this ruinous  Planet  And By the admireable and adoreable  Oeconomy of Jesus    That it is a Contradiction to suppose a  beneficent  Being would create  sentient  or  intelligent  Beings for  Suffering  merely for  Suffering  's Sake ibid  That the  Sufferings  of the  sentient  and  intelligent  Creatures in this present State necessarily supposes a State of  Preexistence  and a future  Lapse  or a  Course  of  Trial  and  Probation    That there may be other  States  and  Mansions    in infinitum  of  progressive  Purification and Perfection and that  Suffering  which in the Divine Purity and the Nature of Disorder must have been  eternal  is made temporary only by the Merit and Suffering of  Jesus    That  spiritual Substance  may be conceiv'd analogous to and not contradictory to Matter sublimed and refined by the Power of  Omnipotence  but even this  Idea  is imperfect  and not satisfactory their Substances being naturally destructive of each other and their Qualities in all their Modifications equidistant  That the  spiritual Body  and immaterial  Spirit  crusted over with Clay may for its Purification progressively be an infinit time in  developeing  these natural Powers and in acquireing the moral Powers defaced by the Lapse but that now under the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  this will be perfected in a finit Time and even the whole  System  of  Saturn  is by general  Laws  vergeing to some great  Catastrophe  or Change  That the  Spirit  as being a Ray of the Divine  Substance  or a Power emitted from his  necessarily  existent Nature is immortal in its own Nature but that the  spiritual  or  aethereal  Vehicle is only immortal by the  Divine  Order and comparatively as the first Particles of Matter are  indivisible    That the thinner and lighter the  Crust  on this  aethereal  Vehicle is the natural Powers will be elicited more readily and freely and the moral Powers acquir'd more easily and fully and the necessary Sufferings thereby lessen'd  That since the  natural Powers  of the  Spirit  are constant and always the same in their  Root  and  Fund  it will follow That our acquir'd Knowledge is but Remembrance That there is in our spiritual Nature inherent and  innate a  moral Sense  and a  natural Sagacity  as well as natural Sensations That there are innate Ideas of God and Virtue and of moral  Good  and  Evil  in the Soul tho' sopited and unelicited as well as a natural Power to perform the  animal Functions  That spiritual  Sensation  and  Senses  justly explain'd are Realities and not Figures That the Soul in her Operations now can only use and employ the material Organs of the  aethereal  Vehicle crusted over as they are with  planetary  Clay which she must endeavour to extend develope and mundify That  Culture  Study and Labour in extending and perfecting the  natural  Powers is but removeing Superfluities cutting off Excrescences and rendering the  aethereal Vehicles  and their  Organs  pliant and supple and for the which we are now condemn'd to labour for our Punishment and Purification That the shortest Way to perfect the  natural  Powers is to labour at the recovering the  moral  Powers  That the  Activity    Sensibility  and  Penetration  the  animal Functions  the Passions Sentiments Memory Imagination and the other more material and less abstracted Operations of the  Soul  and even the  involuntary Functions  the voluntary Motions of the Body are more immediatly performed by the  selfmoveing  immaterial naturally sagacious  Spirit  on the primitive  aethereal  Vehicle  divinely organised but now crusted over with Clay as Springs and Weights move Clockworks the first tho' having an  innate  Principle of  Selfaction  the other only an  extraneous  and adventitious one  That in this  progressive  endless  Purification  and Perfection of an Animal in Body and Spirit there may be many Steps Stations and  Mansions  and one finished another may begin till the  final  Completion  That in this endless  progressive  Purification towards consummat Perfection and Happiness there may be a particular  Law  of  Attraction  Fitness and Similarity proportion'd to the Acquisition of the  moral  Powers and Extension of the natural Powers that may draw and determine them to their several  Stations  and  Mansions  as the Eggs of  Insects  and Seeds of  Plants  are by  Electricity  drawn to their proper  Nidus  's and Leaves till like the  Asymptots  of Hyperbola's they come at last to meet in their Curve ibid  That this Sketch of a System is innocent tho' it should be deem'd a  Romance  which is all I am answerable for  AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE II  PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES about the Preference of  Vegetable  to  Animal Food  and of the End and Design of Providence in  Appointing  the first and on Trial  Permitting  the latter  THAT by our present  Frame  we are fitted as for  Vegetable  so for  Animal  Food at least in the Days of our Vigour but that  Animal  Food on Trial and consequent Miscarriage under the first intended and appointed  Vegetable  Food was permitted by the Author of Nature as a  pis alle  To let us feel the natural and  necessary Effects of our own  Lusts  and  Concupiscence  To produce naturally and  mechanically  those Pains Miseries and Distempers that might create a Horror of inordinat  Lusts  and  Appetites  and afford Time and Opportunities to ponder and think and thereby to return to  Order    Love of Virtue  and its  Source  To shorten the Duration of our natural Lives that Sin and Misery might not increase or last  eternally  To  concentre  our natural Powers to a  Level  with our defaced moral Powers that without clashing they might rise and be restored in the same  Progression  And Perhaps to connive at what without committing Violence on Liberty could not at that Time be prevented  That our present earthly Bodies being compos'd of the now  secondary Sulphur    Salt    Air    Water  and  fine Earth  only and it being certain from  chymical  Experiments that  Sulphur  and  Salt  are the two most active and destructive  Elements  and that the  three  last  Air    Water  and  fine Earth  are more innocent the less active and deleterious and  Animal  Food abounding most in the two first and  Vegetable  in the three last consequently  Animal  Food must be more destructive to  Animal Bodies  than  Vegetable  in the same Proportion Because by  Experiment  the Juice and nourishing  Extract  of Animal Food is more  tenacious  and  glewy  than that of Vegetable Food Because  Animal Food  abounding more with  Salts  and  Sulphurs  and they by their Nature being always in perpetual Motion and Action must  mechanically  tear  Animal  Substances faster than Vegetables which abound most with the more  passive  and innocent  Elements  especially When  fermented  Liquors are join'd to them as Dilution which harden the  solid  Meat and obstruct its Solution and  Digestibility  And  lastly  since the  Particles  of Animal Food being strain'd through the finer  Tubes  and stronger  Organs  of Animal Digestion must be more minutely divided than the Particles of Vegetables can by their fewer and grosser Tubes of Preparation and being destitute of Animal  Heat  and Force and having only the  Solar  Heat and universal Law of  Attraction  common and equal in both on these Accounts the  Particles  of  Animal  must be much finer than the Particles of  Vegetable  Food and consequently have a  proportional  much greater Degree of  Attraction  must therefore be united with greater  Force  and form stronger Obstructions and being more  delicious  betray the Feeder more readily into  Excesses  On all which Accounts I say  Animal  Food must  mechanically  and necessarily create Diseases and shorten Life more readily than  Vegetable    That since what is and  necessarily  is must be a Part of the  Intention  of the  Creator  and since  Animal  Food necessarily begets Diseases and Pains more readily than  Vegetable  Food can there is no accounting for the Permission of  Animal  Food but by supposing Pain and Suffering here a necessary Mean of  Expiation  and  Purification  which  GOD  on  Trial  finding nothing else could reclaim his  rebellious  Creatures  unwillingly  as it were permitted it as a  Father  sends his  Son  to the  Correctionhouse  And that as when by  Pride    Tyranny    Malice    Murder  and  Brutal  Commerce by the more luxuriant and delicious Vegetable Food the  Deluge  came to its  Pitch  he was forced to destroy both the People and their Food by this  Deluge    That to those to whom  Revelation  is familiar the like Means of Correction will be evident from the Permission of  Plurality  of Wives to the  Jews  and that under his immediat and miraculous Government he on their Murmurs  indulged  them in a  Monarchical  Government as a kind  Father  admonishes his froward giddy Child to beware of too familiar Approaches to Fire by burning his Fingers  That there is no accounting for the  Permission  of  Animal  Food on the Foot of  Natural  Religion the wanton Murder of  Animals  for Food when more salutary  Vegetable  Food can be readily had showing a Cruelty and Ferocity inconsistent with beneficent Natures but that the  universal Proprietor  of Life and Happiness might with great  Wisdom    Justice  and Kindness knowing when the Term of  Expiation  of a lower Class of probationary progressive or  lapsed Animals  is accomplish'd give Leave in the Course of his Providence to put an  End  to their present Manner of Living and advance them thereby sooner to a higher State of Being and Felicity and at the same time  secretly  and in Consistence with their  Liberty  to admonish a higher  Rank  of Intelligences what they merited for these to be sure for wise and beneficent Ends perhaps unknowable by us  GOD  might have permitted the killing Animals for our Food as he certainly did for Sacrifice for this we have a  Patent  in Revelation but none for fermented Liquors but as  Physic    Cordials  and  Stomachicks  or  Bitters  on Extremities Sickness inclement Seasons Fatigue or in Festivals  That fermented Liquors of any Kind can never in their Nature be proper or the  best  for  Animal  Health and Life for they are the spurious Invention of  Art  and the further Deviation from the  Simplicity  of Nature which has given us no Intimation of any such Kind of Beverage in the Preparations of pure Nature and which the  Animals who follow the  Laws  of  Nature  will not touch they are properly  Physic    bitter  Draughts and unnatural  Cordials  on Extremities in Sickness and inclement Seasons and only design'd for a  temporary  Relief and occasionally  Fermentation  concentres condenses and contracts as it were to a Point at least to a much smaller Volum like a  Burningglass  which condenses the  solar  Rays to make them more  fierce  all the  deleterious  Particles of the  Vegetables  that is their  Salts  and  Oils  and is the true and sole  Cause  of all our great and atrocious Distempers especially of all the Train of the frightful  nervous  Diseases which now rage universally in  England  like a  Plague  and have been increaseing since the  Conquest  and since Wine has been familiar to all Ranks and Waterdrinking only timeously begun in Life is the only sufficient  Antidote  for these most wretched  lunatick  Distempers  That there are many Evidences of the Hurt  fermented  but especially  spirituous  Liquors do an  animal  Body as That they harden and destroy the  Digestibility  of animal Food and indeed of all kinds of Food in the Stomach Because they  corrugat  and  contract  the  Fibres  and pin together the Particles of the Food so that they cannot be so readily separated and divided into their  integral  nourishing Parts Because by  their Heat and Activity they bring the  Fibres  and  Membrans  of the digestive  Organs  and all the other Solids into too violent and frequent  Vibrations  and  Succussions  and thereby break the  Tone  and destroy the  Elasticity  of these  Organs  dissolve their Continuity and so wear them out much sooner And Because they  stunt  the Ductility and Growth of the animal Organs themselves and thereby hinder their Developement Extension Elasticity and natural Strength by continuing their  linear  or superficial Amplitude folded or rolled up  That all  sentient  and  intelligent  Creatures are in an expiatory perfectioning and progressive State is evident because here they must necessarily suffer and infinit Beneficence could not possibly create any sentient or intelligent Being merely to suffer but chiefly perhaps only for  Expiation  and consequent progressive Perfection and Happiness That probably the early and universal Precept of  Sacrifice  might first introduce  animal  Food which  Sacrificeing  might have been intended Silently and kindly to admonish the  Sinner  to consider what he deserves In this silent manner possibly for the preserving Liberty inviolate all the Animals might partly be design'd to read us Lectures of Instruction in Morality or of the Conveniencies of Life in the same manner By a  Prolepsis  to  perpetuat the Expectation and Hope of some more  noble Sacrifice  with such a View as the  Eucharist  was instituted after  that  Sacrifice had been accomplished But yet this Permission seems to have been against the  Grain  as may be gather'd from the Caution not to eat the Animal's  Blood  in which its  Life  and  deleterious  Qualities alone consisted  This Aversion in infinit Wisdom and Goodness to permit the Use of animal Food which He condescended to merely for the  Hardness  of the  Hearts  of his  lapsed  Creatures kindly to give them a forced Permission to do what He found they would presumptuously do is further shewn by the Distinction between  clean  and  unclean Animals  which were not to be eaten which in their Nature are more apt to  madden  the Passions enrage Distempers and produce an Aversion to Virtue And tho' St  Peter  had a miraculous  Vision  to tell him nothing was  unclean  under the  Gospel  yet that was not till the Doctrine of  Selfdenial  and Mortification was establish'd as the Fundamental of  Christianity    That some  Vegetables  as  Eastern  Gums  Spices    Aromaticks  pungent  Foetids  and  Onion  Tribes are more destructive to  Animals  than young white  animal  Food  To the Difficulties that our  blessed Saviour  eat and drank with  Publicans  and  Sinners  That he wrought his first  Miracle  to produce  Wine  That he fed a Multitude by miraculous  Animal  Food That St  Peter  had a Vision to instruct him that all Food was equal It is answer'd That the Question only is Which of the two Foods  Animal  or  Vegetable  was probably first intended by the  Author  of the Universe before the  Lapse  and the Ruin of the  Planet  we now inhabit That different Repairs are necessary to different Degrees of Ruin even in material Habitations That there is neither  Virtue  nor  Vice  in either kinds of Food but in their  Quantity  or as they are commanded by  lawful Superiors  But that a  low  or vegetable Diet is naturally and mechanically more productive of Health and long Life and consequently of  Knowledge  and  Virtue  than a high  animal  Diet That our  Saviour  came to  seek  to  save  those who were lost and so was under a Necessity of converseing with the  Voluptuous  and  Sinners  But that the Preference he gave to a  low Diet  was implicitly included in his grand Doctrine of  Selfdenial  and takeing up the  Cross  I grant that in our present Situation on this  ruinous Globe  it is  impracticable  and  impossible  for Persons of all Ranks Conditions and Occupations to live intirely on  Vegetables  Their Use  now  is only to cure alleviat and lessen the  Distempers  generated necessarily by  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors And Even these and  spirituous  Liquors are sometimes necessary on Extremities in some Diseases as  Filips  and Cordials for temporary Reliefs and infinit Wisdom foresaw this Mischief of these high Meats and Drinks and provided an  Antidote  for them at least for a Time By makeing the great Bowel the  Liver  to draw off their Poison and turn it into a  salutary Medicin  By forming  mineral  Waters of all kinds with such Profusion and Variety everywhere on the Surface of the  Globe  And By creating the Minerals themselves  Mercury  especially mechanically adjusted for that Purpose among many other Uses and Utilities of ponderous and mineral Medicins which probably were not in the  same Form  or so readily at Hand before the  Flood    That to the Appearances in the present State of Nature that seem to clash with this Doctrine which consists only in these  three  Propositions That  animal  Food in its own Nature is more ready to produce Distempers than  vegetable  Food That therefore infinit Wisdom must have had wise and beneficent Ends in instituteing the  first  and but probably permitting only the  latter  And That therefore the latter must be the proper  Antidote  for Disorders produc'd by the former it is to be observed  further that at present our whole  System  is in Disorder in a purifying and as it were in a  febrile  State labouring in a  perfectionating Progression  by general Laws under natural  Liberty  and the  Harmony  of the Divine Attributes which must at last terminate in relative Order Perfection and universal Happiness That now there is no such thing as avoiding the destroying of  animal  Life absolutly but that it should not be done out of mere  Luxury    Wantonness  and  Ferocity  which even the rapacious Animals do not but from want of any proper Food  That on the whole it is plain from Revelation that  Animal  Food was permitted and  fermented  Liquors not absolutly but their Excesses forbidden That in many Circumstances and Situations a reasonable Quantity of  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors is absolutly necessary for a Time That it is plain from  Philosophy  and  Experience  that Excesses in high animal Food and strong fermented Liquors are the true and adequat Cause of the great and atrocious Distempers That  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors will necessarily shorten Life perhaps one half more readily than  vegetable  Food and unfermented Liquors and in the same Proportion cause Distempers That tho' a moderat Quantity of  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors  will naturally warm and strengthen the Blood and tighten the Solids for a Time and consequently is necessary in all  eruptive  Distempers yet they will shorten Life and produce Distempers much more readily than  vegetable  Food and unfermented Liquors That for bodily and  mechanical  Strength dureing a Time and for a transient Occasion tho'  animal  Food and  fermented  Liquors be the most effectual yet for  intellectual  Purposes  vegetable  Food and  unfermented  Liquors are certainly fittest But to secure the  golden Mediocrity  between bodily Strength and clear penetrating Heads about a half Pound of animal Food and a half Pint of fermented Liquors in the intirely Healthy and Young or rather less seems to bid fairest in Quantity for that Purpose The Valentudinary must gradually sink below this healthy Standard till by Experience they find their own proper Dose  AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE III  A PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY founded on  Experiments  of the  Nature  and  Laws  of  minute inanimat Bodies  and their  Systems  in general  PROPOSITION I THE least  Particles  of Matter are of various Sizes Densities and Figures the very  least  are almost  infinitly small    hard  and  elastic  makeing the  first Order  the  second Order  are compos'd of those and these combin'd make the  third Order    SCHOLIUM The Quantity of  solid  Matter in the  material System  of the Universe may be very small  and yet if duely divided and arranged might answer all the Appearances of  material Worlds    PROP II The  least Particles  of Bodies are indivisible by any  finite  or created Powers  Analogous  to  Gravity  in the great Bodies of the Universe there is in the least Particles of Matter a Principle of  Attraction  and  Repulsion  ibid  SCHOL I What the general Law of  Attraction  and  Repulsion  in the  least  Particles of Matter precisely is has not yet been determin'd only in receding from the  Contact  it is demonstrable that it is greater than the  reciprocal Duplicat    SCHOL II If  Particles  attracted each other in the  reciprocal Triplicat  in their Point of Contact the Force of their  Attraction  would be infinitly greater than at any assignable Distance yet it would not be infinitly greater than the Force of  Gravity  since any Body may be separated by an assignable Force  SCHOL III  Repulsion  begins and goes on where  Attraction  ends and they probably go on according to the same  Law  and Progression but with contrary  Directions  ibid  PROP IV The Force of  Cohesion  in the small Particles of Matter is in a compound  Proportion  of the Quantity of their  cohering  Surfaces and the Quantity of their  attractive  Powers ibid  COROL Therefore the less the  cohering  Surfaces are the less will be the Degree of Cohesion and the least of all will be in  Spheres  or  Spheriods    PROP V The Force of  Attraction  in small Particles increases as the  Size  of the Particles is diminished ibid  PROP VI The  Gravities  of Particles decrease as the  Cubes  of their  Diameters  ibid  COROL Hence from the Smallness and Divisibility of its Parts  Mercury  is so easily rais'd and Bodies may be suspended in  Fluids specifically  lighter than themselves ibid  PROP VII If a  Fluid  attracts the Parts of an immers'd Body more strongly than they do one another they will be equally diffus'd through it  PROP VIII  Elastic  Particles suspended in a Fluid after their  Collision  will resile and by their  Actions  and  Reactions  cause  Fermentation  and  Effervescence  ibid  PROP IX  Unelastic  Particles suspended in a  Fluid  attracting each other will sink and be  precipitated  the same will be produc'd by diminishing the Gravity of the  Menstruum    PROP X The  Figures  of the Particles of all unelastic Fluids must necessarily be  Spherical  and the  Elements  of all Solids must be of some of the regular Solids as  Cubes    Triangles    Prisms  c  SCHOL The Figure of the Particles of  elastic  Fluids is of no Consideration since their  Elasticity  depends only on their  repulsive  Force ibid  PROP XI The  Elasticity  of solid Bodies is the Effect of the  attracting  Force of their Particles ibid  PROP XII That Bodies under a  Rotation  fly off in the  Tangent  is the Effect of the  general Law  by which they continue in their  State  whatever that be  PROP XIII The  Figures  of the Particles and their Actions on one another arising from the Principles of  Attraction  and  Repulsion  together with the Motions impress'd on them by  living  and  intelligent Agents  will probably account for the Appearances of the  material World  if adjusted according to their Laws ibid  PROP XIV  Air  is a  System  of Particles endow'd with a repulsive Force which being fix'd in all  animal    vegetable  and  mineral  Substances are by  Fire    Fermentation    Putrefaction    Dissolution  or any other intestine  Action  and  Reaction  set at Liberty and compose our  Atmosphere  and hence  its  Compression    Weight    Elasticity  and  Density  ibid  SCHOL The  Density  of the  Air  is proportionat to its Compression and therefore its  expansive  Force must be in the direct  subtriplicat Ratio  thereof  PROP XV  Earth  is a loose Collection of the different elementary Particles of Matter of all the  three Orders  thrown together without any regular Combination ibid  PROP XVI  Water  is a Collection of the  Solution  of tasteless  Salts  originally  crystalliz'd  but kept in Fusion by Heat and different Salts are different Combinations of these with the other  Elements    PROP XVII  Acids  seem to be very  attractive  Particles of plain Surfaces and  angular  Points ibid  SCHOL Possibly the Figures of  Acids  may be  triangular Prisms  for all Matter must be figur'd ibid  PROP XVIII  Heat  is the brisk vibrating  Action  and  Reaction  of the  repelling Nitre  of the  Air  and the  aethereal Fluid  with an attractive acid  Sulphur  which  Sulphur  yields an inflammable  Oil  an  acid Salt  a fix'd  Earth  and a little  Metal    COROL Hence the Affinity between  Light  and  sulphureous  Bodies and the true Nature of  inflammable  Spirits ibid  SCHOL Since a  Thermometer  in an exhausted Receiver will rise and fall in the same manner as in the open  Air  and since  polish'd  Bodies in the same  cling  together as strongly as in the  Air  it seems to follow that there is some subtle elastic Fluid pervadeing all Bodies to produce these Appearances  PROP XIX  Light  seems to be the vibrating Particles of hot Bodies driven out by the  repelling  Force with an immense  Velocity  which is increas'd by the  aethereal  Fluid and the  Attraction  of Bodies ibid  SCHOL I Since  Light  is convertible into  Bodies  and  Bodies  into  Light  it would seem that Light is only the Particles of a hot Body thrown off with an immense Velocity ibid  SCHOL II The Rays of  Light  seem to consist of Particles of different Sizes and different Degrees of  Refrangibility  ibid  SCHOL III The  Sun  and  fixt Stars  are immense  Globes  of Matter saturated with the Particles of the  second Order  or of  Light  ibid  SCHOL IV It is not impossible this  Earth  with all the  Planets  and  Comets  should be intended as temporary  Prisons  and Places of Correction for the  Trial    Expiation  or  progressive Purification  of the several Orders of lapsed  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings  PROP XX  Flame  is the sulphureous Smoak of a hot Body  PROP XXI Bodies are  Transparent  whose Pores are sufficiently small and rectilinear ibid  EXPERIMENTS  PROP I  Mercury  consists of smaller Particles than any known Fluid The Particles of  Mercury  the smaller they are the more perfect  Spheres  they are  Mercury  is the heaviest of all natural Fluids  Mercurial  Particles  attract  some Bodies most and  fly  from others the most  Philosophical Corollaries  Therefore the Particles of  Mercury  are most easily rais'd by Heat Therefore they have the greatest  Momentum  Therefore they will readily pass through all  animal  Substances which are lax and porous  Medical Corollaries  Therefore the Particles of  Mercury  are fittest to break  Viscosity  Therefore they are the fittest Medicin to open the  Obstructions  of the small Vessels Therefore they are fittest to cure  Palsies  Therefore they are fittest to antidot the  Scurvy  Therefore they are the best  Antidot  for the  Gout  Therefore they are the best Remedy for  chronical  Distempers caus'd by Excesses Therefore the Particles of  Mercury  duely prepared are the most probable Mean to make the Circulation quite round and intire  through the whole System of the animal  Tubes  that is to thin the Juices  Medical Cautions Mercury  however prepared will infallibly burst those Vessels whose Obstructions cannot be dissolved and break those whose Sides are very slender or which are putrified and therefore  Mercury  is a divine  Antidot  or  real Poison  according as it is managed neither it nor any mineral Medicin being ever design'd by the Creator to enter an animal Body no more than animal Food in his first Intention at least before the Lapse and perhaps not before the  Deluge  the  Minerals  being probably then intended for other Uses and not being perhaps in the  Form  they are now nor on the mountainous Surfaces of the Earth nor dissolv'd in Water as we now find them  The Choice of mineral Medicins  The best Preparation of  Mercury  is that wherein its Particles are most minutely divided and separated and thereby fitted to pervade the smallest  Tubes  ibid  That Preparation of  Mercury  is best where its Particles being minutely divided the Mixture is made with that Body of the most acknowledg'd  specific  Virtue against the Disease  Therefore the  Aqua Mercurialis  is the best and most universal of all Deobstruents in very weak Persons the  Mercurius Alcalisatus  next then the Cinnabar Aethiops Quicksilver purified with specific Extracts  c  ibid  All  mineral  Medicins ought to be infinitly divided before they are sent into an  animal  Body ibid  Mercury  and the  active Salts  are the very worst and most prejudicial Preparations to animal Bodies and are not to be us'd but in small Doses and in Cases that require  Expedition    General medical Corollaries  As Water Bloodwarm is the best Diluent so purified  Quicksilver  is the best Deobstruent But as Water alone may be too sluggish so  Mercury  alone may be too active and ponderous in delicat Constitutions therefore the very best Preparation is where  Mercury  infinitly divided is mix'd with the  specific  Vegetable or Mineral against a given Distemper ibid  Therefore a thin cool low Diet of  vegetable  or very tender and loose animal Substances is the very best Food for delicat and wasted Constitutions  A general medical Scholium  From this  System  or Philosophical Explication of the Nature and Laws of the minute Particles of Matter it will follow That soft mild thin and cool Foods are fittest to carry on and continue  animal  Life and  Functions  That  Spirits    Salts    chymical Oils  and Medicins that have pass'd through the Tortures  of the Fire are most pernicious to animal Bodies That Food of  Animals  which live on  Animals  are the worst kind of animal Food for human Bodies That  Mercury  duely prepared and combin'd with a  specific  Alterative is the best  Deobstruent  and  Dissolvent  That  Milk  and  Vegetables  are the proper Food for young and diseased Animals and tender Constitutions That Water  Beverage  is best for preserving the Faculties clear the Spirits free and prolonging Life That on the whole  Mercury  somehow prepared and Water  naturally  or  artificially  impregnated are the two  Antidots  provided by Nature for  animal  Distempers in  chronical  Cases  AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE IV  PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES on  Spiritual Nature  the  Human Spirit  in particular  THAT the natural Powers of all  Spirits  are these two  Understanding  and  Willing  which suppose a third  viz Living  as their Base  That all created  Spirits  naturally and philosophically can be conceiv'd only as  infinitesimal Miniatures    Sparkles    Emanations  or if I durst use the Words diminutive analogous  Particles  of that infinitly perfect  spiritual Being  who is so intirely  One  that He cannot have Parts yet have these Miniatures of Him an  infinitesimal  Portion of his spiritual Substance endow'd with a proportional  Share of his  natural Attributes  of  Living    Understanding  and  Willing  and so are therefore necessarily  immortal  and cannot be  annihilated    That these  Faculties  or Powers are felt sensibly and perceptibly by duely cultivated Spirits of all Orders and follow by  Analogy  as to the Substance of the  Soul  and these  Faculties  from the necessary Nature and Attributes of the  Deity    That this Meaning is evident in  Revelation  which says  Men are God's Images  and they are there called  Gods  that is they were at first made  infinitesimal Divinities  endow'd with his  natural  and  moral  Attributes in their Order  That all  Pagan  and  Christian  Antiquity believ'd that all created  Spirits  were cloath'd with some material  Vehicle  and that  God  alone was  pure    immaterial    infinit Spirit  and  Revelation  speaks of a  spiritual  that is of an infinitly refin'd and sublim'd  Body    That neither  material  nor  spiritual  Substances are knowable by us at present but by their  sensible  Effects and Acting But that  Matter  and  Spirit  are  contrary  tho' not contradictory in their most  essential  and distinguishing Qualities Matter being divisible in  infinitum  and Spirit indivisible But what infinit Divisibility Rarity Elasticity and Velocity in the Particles of Matter might at  last effect on its Substance and Qualities to give Matter a Nature different from gross porous inert Bodies none but the  Author  of  Matter  and  Spirit  can tell or comprehend But they will eternally be even thus like the  Hyperbolic  Curve and its  Asymptot  probably like  parallel  Right Lines  Living  is probably actuating governing and moveing a divinely  organiz'd  Vehicle  primitive    aethereal  or  planetary  and whereever there is any Degree of  Life    vegetative  or divinely organiz'd Matter only  sensative  or  rational  there of Neceslity must be a  spiritual  so to speak Body or an immaterial immortal and progressive spiritual Substance actuating governing and moveing a divinely  organiz'd  Body of some Order or Nature or another or both united  That there may possibly be  Orders    Ranks  and  Species  of animated Beings with divinely  organiz'd  Vehicles of all  Degrees  gradually rising from the  Coralline  to the highest  Seraphim  and an  Angel  is only a  spiritual  Substance actuating a divinely  organiz'd  Body of an Order and Purity a little higher than that of an  unlapsed  perfect human Being  That we plainly perceive how imperfect and unhappy Beings we are at present we of the  human  Race yet cannot possibly think  that we came thus out of the Hands of our  Creator  but must conclude we have lost our primitive  Creation  State by some wilful  Mismanagement  of our own  That our  primitive  State must necessarily have been That our organis'd Vehicle was entirely  supple  and pliable to our Spirit and That our  Spirit  was entirely  pliable  to the Divine Spirit  That all created  Spirits  being naturally  free  must be necessarily  fallible  That on this Globe there was never a thinking Being come to any Degree of Maturity who found not himself at one time or another miserable and wish'd not to be otherwise this State is called the  Lapse    How this  Lapse  was brought about is not explicitly revealed and is not knowable by mere Reason or  Philosophy  we feel that it is and that is all we at first know certainly GOD'S Design being to  restore  us with the Consent of our own  Liberty  and the  Harmony  of his Attributes discourages vain Curiosity in Particulars all that is revealed to us is general and indefinit we feel that we are imperfect and unhappy and that is sufficient to begin the first  Steps  of our Recovery into Order in Body and Soul we are always certain in the Knowledge of our Recovery of the  second  Step when we have made the  first  of the  third  when we have made the second and soon  in infinitum  more previous Knowledge  would but perplex and confound us and draw us out of the  shortest  Road of  Restoration    That it is not improbable that the  Lapse  was brought about by Steps and Degrees that Way of  Lapseing  being most natural to  finite  Creatures and many of the several  Orders  of Beings might have been concern'd in it  That our  Senses  were given us to  commerciat  with  material  Objects these of our present  System  especially or others we may pass into in which the  Key  and  Logic  of our Knowledge is  Proportion  All we can possibly know of spiritual Natures must be from  Analogy  without Violence on our  Liberty  which make us mere  Vegetables  and from comparing them with the Faculties and Operations of our own  Spirits  and  Analogy  duly cultivated and cautiously guarded in spiritual Nature is answerable to  Algebra  or  Analyticks  in Mathematicks  That since  God is  spiritual Nature and material Nature  is  and exists All  GOD  's Words and Works must therefore necessarily have a  literal  or  material    spiritual  and  divine  Meaning and Sense the  literal  for Beginners the  spiritual  for the Advanced and the  divine  for the Perfect Perhaps it may be thus in the Account of the  Lapse  and all the  Group  of this Affair certainly were literal  Paradise  a Place of material Delight the  Tree of Life  a Food to perpetuat the  then material Vehicle in Health and Liveliness the  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil  quite the contrary the  Serpent  the highest fallen  Angel  The spiritual Meaning may refer to the moral Powers of the Soul as the literal did to the bodily the  Tree of Life  may refer to the Source of the Divinity the  Father  the  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil  to the  GodMan Jesus Christ  the  Serpent  the grand Deceiver  Paradise  the natural Powers of the  Soul  which were contracted and sopited by gross Matter upon the  Lapse  after the  moral  Powers were defac'd by Rebellion Disorder Selfishness and inordinat Love of the Creature  That by this  Lapse  from the Principle of  Attraction  establish'd universally in the  spiritual  as well as  material  World the primitive  aethereal  Vehicle was gradually turn'd to a  planetary  one such as we now live in and thereby the  Activity    Energy  and Extension of the  natural  Powers of the Soul were greatly confin'd and stunted as to their elicited Acts tho' they could not be so as to their  Fund  and potential Nature and now they must rise to Perfection in proportion only to the acquir'd  moral Powers  and by Labour and  Culture  under the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  and by the Aid of supranatural Grace be develop'd extended and purified  That perhaps all  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings of all Ranks must necessarily pass through a State of  Trial    Probation  and  Apprenticeship  before they can be even by Omnipotence confirm'd and  eterniz'd  in  Illability  and  Impeccability  as a  Potter  vitrifies his Ware by Fire or a Smith  steels  his  Iron  All that is necessary or proper for us to know or be certain of in our present State is that we are  lapsed Probationers  and progressive towards Perfection and Happiness more precise Knowledge of our  preexistent  or future State might only retard our Progress  Whether the ruinous  Planet  we now inhabit was the primitive Seat of  unlapsed  human Spirits and by their gradual  Lapse  was insensibly turn'd into its  present Condition  is impossible for us now to determin  Paradise  as described by  Moses  is now nowhere to be found and most  Climats  on a Balance of Incommodities with Conveniencies are pretty much upon an Equality to the Natives We find  Luxury  destroys our  planetary  Vehicles and  Pestilences  infect the  Atmosphere  and the Earth as well as its Inbitants But it is probable the Divine Power might suspend or accelerat the  general Laws  of Nature to turn this  Globe  from its  Paradisiacal  to its present State  An  animal  Body being a  System  only of  mechanical  Powers compos'd of fine  elastic infinitesimal  Lines or Threads form'd into  various  Webs  or  Membranes  and they into  Tubes  or solid Bundles are by proper Liquors kept for a time in due  Elasticity  having under them the primitive  aethereal  Vehicle which is the proper Covering of the  Soul  and its immediat Instrument between it and the  planetary  Plaistering which when broken drops and perhaps they Soul and  aethereal  Vehicle pass into others till its progressive Purification be finish'd into  Illability  and  Impeccability    Matter is capable only of  Division    Figure    Motion  and  Situation  and is passive and inert  Spirit  is  selfmotive  and  selfactive  and must be the Principle of  Motion  in Bodies without which they would continue for ever  inert  but so far as their Principle of  Attraction  or  Repulsion  produc'd probably by some  subtile universal Fluid  sets them into Action But this Fluid seems confin'd chiefly to  inanimat  Matter and does nothing in particular or eminently in proper animal Functions but as the  general Laws  of Nature operate and concur with all  material Operations  and the Whole of animated Functions seem to be  directly  and  eminently  transacted by the  actuating  immaterial Principle on the  divinely organiz'd aethereal Vehicle  which communicats its  Energy  to the  planetary  Plaistering So that the material Spirit of Sir  Isaac    Hugens  and  Leibnitz  's rapid Fluid  and even our common  animal  Spirits seem to be without any Use but in inanimat Motions and Appearances And perhaps  animal  Motions and  Functions  may be better understood and explain'd by supposing what is  Fact  that our Solids the  Nerves  especially which are the more immediat Instruments of  animal  Motions and their Functions are  membraneous cellular Tubuli  preserv'd in their proper  Elasticity  and Tone by a  milky Oil  contain'd in them and are  mechanically  adjusted at first by the immediat Hand of the  Almighty  and fitted to convey from the  immaterial Spirit  a Beginning of proper  harmonious  Vibrations and  Oscillations  which may perhaps be promoted and forwarded by the correspondent  Undulations  of an infinitly rare  elastic  Fluid disseminated thro'  universal Space  which being sent in a proper Direction by the appropriated  Nerves  to the peculiar  Muscles  and divinely  organiz'd  Instruments conveys proper Action Energy and Motion to them and  Bodies  and their  Effluvia  so and so vibrating may to the same  membranous Tubuli  communicat peculiar  Vibrations  fitted to impress a Sensation of their Presence and of Bodies and their Qualities to the  intelligent  naturally  sagacious Spirit  so that the whole Work may be directly transacted between the  Spirit  and outward Bodies by the divine  Mechanism  of proper bodily  Organs  and the  aethereal  Fluid may be to  animated  Bodies in their Motions and Functions not essential but accidental or commodious for a more convenient Propagation as Air is to  Animals  or Water to the  Fish    That  Living    Activity  or  Liberty  and Intelligence in some Degree and all their  Modes  are necessary to all  animated  Beings of all Orders and the Difference in the Individuals of the same Order depends on the  Frame  and Texture of their  Vehicles  in a great measure so that probably at first there might have been no Difference of  Sexes  that depending on a design'd different  Configuration  of this  planetary  Crusting That some Power  analogous  to the original creative Attributes in the  Deity  arising from his infinite  Selfactivity  might be communicated to all  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings is not improbable But how this  infinitesimal creative  Power operated before the  Lapse  is not known Perhaps by an intense  Willing  under the Influence of the  Divine Spirit    It is highly probable from the Necessity of  Suffering  in the present State that all the  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings that shall ever  live  or appear on this  Globe  were all created at the same Instant miscarried in their  Probation  and were all at the same time confin'd into  infinitesimal  Prisons of  this ruinous  Planet  in the  Miniature  Seeds  Ova  and  Animalculs  of the primitive  Pairs  or Stock to be progressively propell'd into sensible Living on this  Planet  all by general  analogous  Laws in their Order and this progressive  Propagation  was kindly design'd as a Mean of recovering their  moral  Powers by the Benefits arising from the Acquisition of Virtue and Wisdom in the Parents tho' the contrary has fallen out  There may be  original  Differences in the  Spirits  of the  Individuals  of the same Order of Intelligences some having one of the essential and natural Attributes of the  Spirit  in a higher Extent than the other it may be sufficient to constitute the  same Order  that their  Aggregats  be equal But the Perfection of the  aethereal Vehicle  Culture and the Acquisition of the moral Attributes makes the most signal Difference in this State as Air Exercise and Diet improve the  Health  so does  Culture  in the Acquisition of the  moral  Powers of the Mind The natural Powers are constant and invariable as to their  Fund  and Capacity but are impeded from  elicit  Acts by the Clumsiness and Want of due  Culture  of the  animal  and  intellectual  material  Organs    The  Mainoeuvre  of Providence in the Restoration seems to be thus The radical  natural  Powers being constant and invariable in their  Fund  and Capacity but the  moral  Powers being defac'd by the  Lapse  infinit Goodness ever acting by his own  beneficent  Nature designing to recover these  moral  Powers tied down the  Energy  and  Elicitation  of the  natural  Powers by Ligatures of this ruinous  Planet  at first into that of mere  Living  and included the whole Mass of  lapsed  human Intelligences in the  Loins  of  One  or a Pair who were to be the universal Parents designing the  selfactive  and  selfmotive  Principle in each should under certain  general Laws  break and work off these  Ligatures  in their several  Orders  while they by other  general Laws  relating to  spiritual  Nature  Prophecy  to wit  Miracles    Apostolick  Lawgivers supernatural  Influences  and  Graces  and at last by the overwhelming  Light  and Love of the  Messiah  his only begotten  Son  should recover in them the defac'd  moral  Virtues  Hence it is evident the first and initial Steps of this Restoration must in a great measure depend on the  Sanity  of the  Adamical  Machin because when our earthly Tabernacle is greatly disorder'd these  elementary  Steps in the  Developement  of the natural and the Acquisition of the  moral  Powers cannot be so readily brought about which depends greatly on the  Parentage  for the whole Aggregat of all that is connected with the  Parents their Bodies Humors and  material  or  spiritual  Qualities are transfus'd and transubstantiated through the whole and descend to Posterity just as they possess them and so the Children must fare accordingly  It may happen by Accident by Disease by universal Causes that one Set of  nervous Glands  in the Brain one Set of  membranous Tubuli  the material  Organs  of Cogitation may be more spoil'd broken and worn out in some than the others both in Parents and Children which will make a great Difference in the  elicit  Acts of the  natural  Powers and which will make the Difference between a  Lawgiver  a  Philosopher  a  Hero  and an  Artisan  But this whole Affair is more immediatly under God's special and particular  moral  Government of his World tho' perhaps by general Laws only  occasionally  and on great and worthy Motives suspended  That at present the  Perfection  of  intellectual  Faculties depends in a great measure on the  Sanity  of the bodily Machin seems evident because The  Adamical Machin  was intended only to suspend the  elicit  Acts of the  natural  Powers in their most eminent Degree to give us Fredom by developeing and throwing off their  Incrustation  to acquire the  moral  Powers By Experience  we find that in Disorders and Distempers of the Body the  intellectual  Operations are either inconstantly weakly or unsteadily perform'd It is  Fact  that in  seminal Miniatures  in  Embryo  and Childhood and for a long time the  Soul  does nothing but perform the  living  and  animal Functions  We find that  Luxury    Leachery    Laziness  strong Passions  inclement  Air  Bruises  and Accidents that injure the Body hurt and destroy the free and easy Exercise of these Faculties in the Acquisition of  Science  and  Virtue  We actually see that as the Body inlarges and the Organs of the Senses strengthen the  intellectual  Faculties and their elicit Acts grow stronger All  intellectual  as well as vital Operations are perform'd by the  Intermediation  of  modulated  and  harmonious Vibrations  on  membranous Tubuli  the  Nerves  and they absolutly depend on the State of the Body As  Luxury    Leachery  and  Laziness  will spoil these  intellectual  Operations so on the other hand a  low cool Diet    Air  and  Exercise  proper  Evacuation  and the mild  ponderous  Medicins will cure and mend them and bring them often to the same sometimes to a better State than they were before  From hence it is evident that the whole Work of our Restoration in some measure depends  on  ourselves  in Cooperation with the Divine Assistance under his Providence and the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  the whole Creation from  inert  Matter up to the highest  Cherubim  being as it were an inverted Cone rising from a Point and made of  infinitesimal Surfaces  as it were contitinually inlarging which makes their  Order  being all  Pictures  less or greater of the  radical  or natural Attributes of their  Creator  but Men having defac'd their  moral  Attributes are imprison'd in Gaols of this  ruinous Planet  that by a progressive Expiation Purification and Labour they may recover these and so become again  similar  to their Original in their  moral  as well as  natural  Powers and so become again  infinitesimal Divinities  in their  Order  and perpetually happy  The human Soul has innate constantly and invariably in it all the  natural  Powers it was first created with even now in its lapsed State at least in its  Fund    Capacity  and  Essence  only they are suspended chain'd down and concentred as to its  elicit  Acts by the  Adamical  Tabernacle like a  Felon  in a Dungeon and will drop at last and so perhaps passing through various  planetary Gaols  will progressively recover the Use of their  natural  Powers as they acquire the  moral  ones  From whence it will follow that the  Culture  of the natural Powers the Acquisition of Sciences and all  intellectual  Exercises are but  Remembrance  cutting off  Obstacles  and removeing Impediments opening Passages and widening  Apertures  through this  Adamical  Prison which is the most readily and effectually brought about by endeavouring to acquire the  moral  Powers  That  Memory  is but an Affection of the  Understanding  and  Will  fixing the Attention and Reflection like  seeing  in the  Eye  by the Effort of the  Will  The  Understanding  is passive and  inert  as every material Organ is It is the  Will  that is the ruling and commanding Faculty and Sovereign in the Soul The  Will  is infinit and unlimited and may act in Contradiction and Contrariety to the Understanding is so absolutly unlimited infinit and unconfin'd that it extends to all Distances without the Intermediation of Body Being a selfmotive and selfactive Principle it is no less real in its Operations tho' it do not always effect its Volitions In it lies the true and essential natural  miniature Image of the Deity    Some have thought the  Will  of all  free Agents  so  infinitly free  in its own Nature as it was deriv'd from the  creative  Source of Liberty and Power the  Deity  that He  left it  free  hid and imperceptible directly from his own  Penetration    Espial  and  Influence  for so much they think a  selfmotive Power  necessarily implies tho' but an infinitesimal one and that even  Omniscience  knew not that the  Angels  had lapsed till the Rebellion actually happen'd but had from all Eternity provided for the Possibility of such an Event That to ennoble his Creatures and make them fit to  commerciat  with Himself He might suspend his  Omniscience  to magnify his  Omnipotence  and might designedly and  arbitrarily  not foresee tho' He certainly always might the contingent and natural Actions of his  intelligent  Creatures to make them more worthy of Him But this bold and unwarranted Supposition tho' it might solve some Difficulties about the  Lapse  about  Prescience  and  Predestination  and in the  Oeconomy  of Revelation and the  Restoration  is perhaps inconsistent with the Perfection of the Divine Nature and since infinit  Penetration  and  Sagacity  will equally answer the same Difficulties and is less derogatory from infinit Perfection the former Supposition is untenable I think  As the  trine  Dimensions of  Matter  and  Space  and their necessarily being neither fewer nor more give us in unanimated Nature a lively Picture of the  Trinity in Unity  in  the Divine Nature so the three fundamental  natural  and  essential Powers  of all intelligent Creatures carry up the  analogical  Picture higher which perhaps passes through all the  celestial Hierarchy  and all intelligent Nature up to their Source the  Creator  who is the last and highest Term of this  Climax  as He is so we are in our spiritual Nature with the uncomprehensible Difference there is between the lowest  Finite  and absolute  Infinitude  As in our Nature there is  Living    Understanding  and  Willing  so in his there is  Selfexistence    Omniscience  and  Omnipotence  or analogous to in the Revelation Language  Father    Son  and  Holy Spirit  But as  Living    Understanding  and  Willing  in us and all Creatures are but as it were  Modalities    Qualities    Faculties  and  Powers  in the Divine Nature on the contrary they must be  Realities    Subsistences  and  Beings  because every essential and radical  Attribute  in  God  must be actually  God  because of his infinit Simplicity and Perfection But this Representation of the Divine Nature is here only alledg'd as an Allusion and  analogous  Picture to take off the Difficulties in this inexplicable  Mystery  and in some Degree to reconcile it to modest guarded  Philosophers  of honest Hearts who are conscious of their own  low  Rank in the Scale of Intelligence The  Arian  and  Sabellian  Heresies being the two Extremes are yet widely different in their Influence on Christian Perfection The first dwindling the  Merit    Dignity    Example  and  Satisfaction  of the Saviour of Men into a mean low  human Transaction  the  second  being only too  philosophically  nice and  punctilous  about the  Unity  of the Divine Nature which tho' I think this  emblematical miniature  Representation of it actually existent in all intellectual Nature fairly reconciles and makes as clear as our present State will admit  The immaterial  Soul  and  aethereal  Vehicle sopited in a State of mere  vegetable  Life for perhaps many Ages in the  seminal Animalcul  by this  planetary  Incrustation in time appears on this  Globe  becomes sensitive feels Pain and Misery then begins  Instinct  and  Remembrance  from precedent Suffering and stores the Mind with  Ideas  or Pictures of absent Actions and Things and on these the  Understanding  operats to produce a Facility and Habit of Reasoning as the material Organs and Instruments of these Operations  develope  and strengthen Reflection and Remembrance of present or past Suffering awakens Conscience an innate Faculty of the Soul this Faculty as the Ideas multiply Sensations become more intense Reflection more strong and frequent  and the intellectual Organs are dispos'd becomes more anxious and vehement and providential disposing Accidents or natural Occurrences incline us to provide for a durable future Happiness at least when this  Adamical  Tabernacle shall crumble into Dust and then perhaps we come to a State to say in earnest  Lord    what shall I do to be saved  which seems to be the precise Condition infinit  Love  and  Goodness  intends by this wonderful  Oeconomy  to bring us into  AN ABSTRACT OF DISCOURSE V  On NATURAL ANALOGY its  Laws  and some of its  Consequences  THINGS may differ in  Degree  as well as in  Kind    DEF Difference in  Degrees  is where things having their  essential  Qualities the  same  admit in these Qualities a  More  and a  Less  ibid  DEF Difference in  Kind  is where some of the  essential  Qualities of things compar'd are  common  some are  different  ibid  DEF By  Ratio  or Relation is meant the  Reference  or Connexion any two things compar'd have with one another whose  essential  Qualities common admit of a  More  or  Less  ibid  DEF  Similarity  is where there is an Equality or Sameness of  Relations  In the Substance and essential Qualities of things compar'd differing only by a  More  or a  Less  In  abstracted  and  simple Ideas  this Sameness is commonly called  Similitude  of  Ratio's  In Things Substances or Aggregats of Qualities it may be called  Similarity  of  Relations    DEF  Things    Substances  and  Qualities  are meant to be  progressive  which are constantly increasing or decreasing  similarly    SCHOL  Space    Time    Motion  and  Velocity  seem to be no  Realities  or external Things but mere  Modifications  different  Situations  and  Circumstances  of Bodies or Matter and are only our Manner of  conceiveing  or considering  these  A  particular Space  or the  Locality  of a particular Body seems to be the  Mathematical  Term or the Limits of the Three Dimensions of a Body as a Point is of a Line or a Body in the Instant of its Evanishing or Generating And  universal Space  is just such an  Idea  as infinit Number or an infinitly  great Body  or a mere  Ens Rationis  And to shew that they are all but  abstracted Ideas  and our partial Manner of conceiveing Things from our limited Capacity if we perform actually the  Arithmetical  Operations as the Expression points them out on proper infinit  Series's  and throw away  all the lesser Quantities we shall come to all the  Mysteries  in  Fluxions  and  Differentials    Ratio's  and  Series  commonly known which are acknowledg'd to be only abstracted  Ideas  and  technical  Arts to supply the Defects of our Faculties which are not intuitive but progressive they admit of Degrees or a  More  and  Less  only as belonging to and being connected with Body viz  Space    Time    Motion  and  Velocity  are Relations or Modifications only of Body or Matter  DEF  Relative Infinit  is such as is suppos'd to increase or decrease  perpetually  yet by no finite Power can be brought to and no finite Capacity can assign or conceive its  limiting Terms  viz the  Greatest  or the  Least    DEF  Absolute Infinitude  is the sole Attribute of the  Deity  who is infinitly infinit in all  Perfections  and  Realities  ibid  DEF Things only are  contradictory  which totally destroy one another destroy their  Subsistence    Substance  and  Qualities  ibid  SCHOL It is very doubtful nay I think impossible there can subsist a full Contradiction among  created  Things Substances or Qualities since they must all be  Effluxes  of the  Deity  in whom there can subsist no Contradiction For in created Things to become totally  contradictory  there must be an equal  Action  and  Reaction  to have produced  it but in all Creatures there seems to be a  Subsistence  and Reality which cannot be totally destroy'd by one another but by a Power and  Energy  equal to that by which they were created and infinit  Perfection  cannot be contrary to itself There may therefore be a  Contrariety  among created Substances and Qualities but not a full  Contradiction  or total Annihilation of their Subsistence Substance and all their Qualities For even between  material  and  spiritual  Substances there will remain still  Substance    Subsistence  a  Relation  an Alliance a Power of Expansion and Remission both of their Substance and Qualities which will make them  alliable  and as the  Chymists  speak will make them capable of an Amalgama like  Quicksilver  with  Lead  tho' they will eternally act by Contrariety on one another's Substances and Qualities and ever counteract one another  DEF  Analogy  is a  Similarity  in Substances and essential Qualities differing only by a  More  or a  Less  ibid  SCHOL  Analogy  is of two kinds  perfect  and complete and  imperfect  and incomplete ibid  DEF  Perfect Analogy  is where there is a total  Similarity  of Substances and essential Qualities differing only in  Degrees  ibid  SCHOL There are I think  Substances  as well as Things and Qualities of a  middle Nature  between the  Extremes  in every  created Reality and this seems to be necessary from the Infinitude of the  Divine Nature  as well as from the Nature of  Finitude  and Creature which must be various and gradual And as between any two given  Terms  there are an Infinity of  mean Proportionals  assignable and between an  infinitly small  and an infinitly  great part  of the Diameter of an  infinit Circle  there is the  Perpendicular  neither infinitly small nor great so there must be material and spiritual Substances of all Degrees of Sublimity Purity and Perfection which tho' similar may differ in Degrees  COROL Hence it may be possible there may exist material Substances continually approaching to the Nature and Qualities of spiritual Substances which yet they can never arrive at like the  Asymptots  of an  Hyperbola    COROL Hence there may possibly be material Fluids so infinitly  rare    spiritual  and  elastic  that they may permit gross porous  planetary  Bodies with only an infinitly little Resistance tho' that Resistance may be still  somewhat  and but as the  Sun  diminishes only infinitly little continually in the Emission of her Light neither the  spiritual Fluid  nor the  Sun  can be design'd to last in their present Condition a Duration equal to  GOD  's  Eternity    DEF  Complex Analogy  is where there is only a  Similarity  between a certain Number of essential Qualities common to the Things compared which differ in Degrees but are diversified in other Qualities less  essential  ibid  PROPOSITION  All Creation    the whole System of the Universe    with all the particular Systems in Nature    are or can be nothing    but the supreme Being and his Attributes    transubstantiated into Being and Perceptibility but the Cause will be always different from the Effect    the Artificer from the Work  This may be demonstrated  à priori  from the Nature and Attributes of the first Cause but to illustrate it  à posteriori  some Instances may be proper  § In the  vegetable  World to explain their Growth and Multiplication the infinitly rare elastic material Fluid mention'd judiciously applied will be sufficient as also in the Vegetation and Growth of  Minerals    § The totally  inanimat  Creation especially our now  secondary Elements  of  Air    Water    Light    Salts  and  Mercury  in the peculiar Fitness of the Size Figure Law of Attraction and Gravity shew the infinit Wisdom of their Contriver for had they  not been figur'd so as they are now in Nature to fit the  Tubes  of  Vegetables  and to combine them into their now integral Parts they could not have been proper Materials for the Accretion of these  Vegetables  and if they had not been so combin'd and  moulded  in the Vegetables there had been no proper Food for  Animals    The Difference between  Vegetables  and  Animals  lies in this that for the Actuation Growth and Multiplication of the  first  there neither is nor is wanted any other Power or  Energy  than what an infinitly rare and  elastic  material Fluid produces on a divinely  organis'd  material Machin but in the  latter  there is a  selfmotive  and  selfactive  spiritual Substance actuating and governing all their  Functions  of some Order or Degree even in the lowest  Brute  and  Insect    § The  human Powers  their Degree Order and the Nature of their primitive aethereal  Vehicle  with its now Plaistering have been sufficiently explain'd  § The  Angelic Hierarchies  must be infinit in their Number rising in a  harmonious  Progression and Variety whose Seats may possibly be the  Fixt Stars  and their  analogous planetary aethereal Systems  and  Apparatus  and these must be infinit in Number likewise to preserve the  Equilibrium  in universal Space and their original Distances from  each other they must have one  generical  Nature which must be that of the  radical Attributes of the Deity    Living    Understanding  and  Willing  their  specific  Differences may consist in  Light  and  Love  that some are more eminently luminous others more ardently  loving  and this Difference seems to take Place even on this  ruinous Planet  in the different Complexions and Talents of Mind in the different  Orders  of Men which can only account for the odd Diversity in the Children of the same Parents under the same Education and Example  The  Fixt Stars  which must be infinit in Number seem to be the material  Mansions  of  unlapsed  tried and purified angelical  Hierarchies  and of restor'd sentient and intelligent  lapsed  Creatures  God's Throne  his  Shechina  is represented as above  Elijah  went upwards and  Christ  ascended Bodies of all Orders or different Purity must have an  ubi  a local Situation and a parmanent  Mansion  at last These  Fixt Stars  and their  planetary Apparatus  may be the Seats of the  Unlapsed  and  Restor'd  and their  aethereal Vehicles  may be of the same Matter with their  Mansions  and the Matter of these luminous and glorious Seats and the  Vehicles  made of them may be  eternis'd  by  harmonious Vibrations    and a perpetual  Flux  and  Reflux  of their Rays  GOD  being the Creator of all sentient and intelligent Beings the efficient Cause and Object of perfect Felicity it is a manifest Contradiction he should creat any such without  impressing  in the very Essence of their Nature an ardent and insatiable  Tendency  and Ardor after  Reunion  with him and accordingly the  Desire of Happiness  in all  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings is invariable and unextinguishable as we see however they may mistake the  End  or Means by being  labile  and placeing it in spurious  Selfishness  and inordinat Love of the Creatures and in the Distinction and Contrariety between this  innate  Byass and that  adventitious  one does the Essence of Misery and  Hell  in all future States consist but this last  Byass  being acquir'd only and not  innate  and  essential  the  Love    Merits  and  Satisfaction  of the  Son  of  God  were contriv'd from all Eternity to melt down and efface  Is it not highly probable that the  System of Saturn  the  Planets  and their  Satellits  may be the local  Prisons  and Dungeons or Correctionhouses of the several Orders of lapsed  probationary  and  progressive sentient and intelligent Beings  They differ vastly in their Accommodations they seem to be  under some  penitential Disciplin  from many obvious Imperfections and  Oddities  not easily otherwise accountable or reconcileable to the Simplicity Beauty Harmony and regular Order of all the Works of an infinitly perfect and powerful Being but with infinit Propriety and Wisdom seem fitted for the Design of Penitence Correction and initial Purity and Perfection  The  Comets  cannot possibly be the Seats of the  Blessed  they are too many to supply only our  Decrease  of Water their Alternations of extreme Heat and Cold Light and Darkness are too  violent  for any animated Vehicle in a State of Happiness They seem more probably to be the Habitations of animated Beings under the Expectation of the  last Sentence  or to be the Condemn'd Holds of  GOD  's Kingdom  The next immediat  Mansions  to this or the several Stations and Mansions design'd for the respective  Purification  of Soul and Body of lapsed sentient and intelligent Beings and all the several Steps Stations or  Mansions  in all Probability have a gradual Resemblance or  Analogy  to one another and to this State here and this  Planet  we now inhabit as the first or initial Term upwards or downwards respectively in those upwards all the Beauties Comforts and pure Delights here increasing similarly in Degree without their Deformity  Miseries or Pains in those downwards all the contrary This Climax seems naturally to flow from the Simplicity and Immutability of the Divine Nature by  Analogy  and is conform to Revelation All Bodies or  Vehicles    planetary  and  aethereal  must have an  ubi  and a fixt  Mansion  at least for a Time and all sentient and intelligent Beings must have a  Polity    Order  and  Laws  be under a Government and Subordination else it would not be a  happy State  but  consummat Misery GOD  is a  God  of Order and all his Works are performed with  Order    Number    Weight  and  Measure  and must have all a mutual  Analogy  or as near a Resemblance to one another as the Nature of Things will admit  Analogy  does not at least always directly and infallibly  demonstrat  the real Existence and necessary Production of Things  ad extra  but it strongly illustrats explains and makes them consistent with and consonant to the Things that we know already see and feel to exist it makes them different Links only of the same  Chain  of Effects and similar Terms of the same Progression removes Difficulties and makes Things rational and fit Objects for a rational  supreme Cause  to work by and this is the solid Foundation of all true  Philosophy  which can only gather Causes and general Laws by Induction from repeated single  Experiments    and is as high an Evidence as the Nature of  Finitude  and our Rank of Intelligence will admit in imperceptible Things and when confirm'd by  Revelation  rises to the Evidence of a  Demonstration  in the strictest Sense  We may  err  and  blunder  in it as we may in  Algebra  and  Geometry  but often our Errors in the last come but from Want of Culture Precipitation or a wrong Head only but in the  Analogy  that leads us to the Knowledge of the Divine Purity and Nature and the Necessity of our own Purification and Perfection for  invisible  States and the Nature of  Spirits  our Blunders are often owing to a wrong  Heart  Licentiousness  Selfishness  and Independency If we went on in natural  Analogy  as we do in natural  Philosophy  and  Geometry  by the  simplest    plainest  and most obvious Cases first collected by  Induction  laid them up as a  Store  to proceed on to the higher Terms of the  analogical Progression  and with Attention and Humility went on from  inanimated  Matter and its  Law  to  Vegetation    Animation    Spiritual  Being up to the  supreme Cause  perhaps great Proficience might be made in time by such a Method  Analogy  is the only Mean of Knowledge that can secure  Liberty  in  lapsed Intelligences  I will illustrate my Meaning by an  Example  in the  System  of  Saturn      GOD  bringing Creatures into Existence must have made them after the most perfect  Pattern  and therefore stampt them with his own Image and so they must bear a Resemblance to him and to one another which is  Analogy  The Number of Qualities added to  Existence  together with the Degrees of these Qualities determin their  Order  The material World is a  Transcript  of the  spiritual  and there is a more immediat Relation between each  material System  and the  Intelligences  to which it belongs and should they lapse and fall into Disorder their  Mansion  would make a  similar  Change There are many Evidences of this  Analogy  between the  material  and  spiritual Systems  The  Sun  is placed in the  Centre  of our  System  the material  Image  of the  Deity  the  Planets  revolve about  him  in different  Times  and  Periods  to represent the several  Orders  of  lapsed  Intelligences these  Planets  have no Light in themselves it is all deriv'd by  Reflection  from  him    Heat    Light  and their Consequence  Attraction  are his chief Properties and by this  Attraction  the  Planets  are kept in their  Orbits  which strongly  pictures  out the  Love of God  continually soliciting all Intelligences to a nearer Approach to  him  The  Light  of the Sun is diffus'd through  the whole  System  representing  that Light which enlightens every Man that comes into the World  an  Emblem  of him who came forth from the Father of Lights  GodMan  The  Sun's Light  is always accompanied with  Heat  which represents the  Holy Spirit  the Principle of spiritual Life The various Magnitudes their Distances from the  Sun  with the  periodical  Times of the  Revolutions  of the  Planets  will express the different Degrees of the  Lapse  and the Times allotted for their first Trials and Probation The  Comets  by their long  elliptical  Orbits are thrown off to the greatest Distance and again drawn back to the nearest Approach to the  Sun  to represent the Extremes of  Love  and  Punishment  to the same Intelligences in order to purify them The  Planets  are acted upon by two different Forces  Attraction  and the  projectile Force  which are contrary to one another The  projectile  Force makes the  Planet  recede perpetually from the  Sun  while the Force of  Attraction  prevents this Effect the  projectile  Force belongs to the  Planet  the  attractive  to the  Sun  How wonderfully does all this  Oeconomy  proclaim and speak in a Language truly natural and proper to the Majesty and Wisdom of the  Deity  the Nature of the  Lapse  the Action of Selfishness and inordinat  Love of Creatures and the Force of the  Divine Love  in the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  For it is suppos'd by the best  Phīlosophers  that the  solar Attraction  will at last prevail over the  projectile Force  and thereby both  Planets  and  Comets  will be swallowed up and transform'd into the Substance of the  Sun  FINIS  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON AND EXPLICATIONS OF THE Preceding DISCOURSES  § THERE seems to be something solid in one Observation  Leibnitz  makes  viz  the  Mark  or  Criterion  between the Works and Operations of  Nature  or the  GOD  of Nature and the Works of  Art  or of  finite  Power and Wisdom  viz  That  GOD  or Nature works always by  Organs infinit  in Number or in a perpetual convergent  Progression  of  Organs  or Means towards some one or many wise  Ends  or  Art  by  Organs finite  in Number or numerable by  Organs    Creature    Man  is always meant a separable distinct Part of a  Machin  For  Example    we may be able to reckon the  Wheels    Springs    Pullies    Chains    c  of any  Watch  or  Clock  or any  Machin  how complicated soever made by  Art  But who can reckon the  Fibres    Tubes    Membranes    Valves    Inosculations    Ligatures  Degrees of  Curvature  in the  Tubes    c  of a  Pile  of Grass or of a  Feather  of a Bird The further we go by our Senses assisted even by the most perfect  Art  their  Number  multiplies on us but then if we could descend into the  Figure    Number  and  Law  of  Cohesion  of their component Particles we should be intirely lost and all our  Art  or Management would leave us in thick Darkness and utter Confusion In the Works of the  GOD  of Nature there is no  Maximum  or  Minimum  assignable or conceiveable by us Sir  Isaac Newton  has demonstrated the infinit  Tenuity  of the  Particles  of  Light  and the progressive  Analogy  of Nature shews it is possible that there may be Fluids as much more  rare  and of as much lesser Particles as those of Sand are bigger than those of  Light Leuvenhoeck  's Discoveries of the Minuteness of some  Animalculs  and of some  Tubes  of Animals are scarce credible by any one who has not seen some of them as I have The ingenious Dr  Porterfeild  has demonstrated the extreme Tenuity of even an  organiz'd  and compounded  nervous Fibre  and there is no Reason from the Nature of  Matter  from the Laws of  Mechanism  or from the  Divine  Attributes to stop there we may descend still lower or higher in  infinitum  and be warranted by Reason and  Geometry  One great Fault in natural  Philosophers  has been that they have rejected every Account as incredible imaginary and fictitious which suppos'd  Fluids  extremely or infinitly  rare    rapid  and  elastic  as is that of  Huygens  's  Leibnitz  and Sir  Isaac Newton  's and yet some such there must infallibly exist in Nature as the  Phaenomena  shew For if the natural Motions on our Earth in Bodies are perform'd by  Air    Water  and  Heat  since we know sensibly these are Fluids of a finite and pretty near determinable Size Figure and Degree of Gravity in their  Particles  the  Analogy  of Nature will make it as evident that the other less known secret subtile and unaccountable Appearances may be perform'd by some other properly condition'd Fluid I mean only in the Appearances of the  material World  I say as certainly as if the first Terms of a  Series x  +  x    +  x    +  x      c  were given I should certainly conclude the th th and th Terms of such a  Series  were  x    +  x    +  x      § THE  Threads  the last and the least  Fibres  or  linear Filaments  of all  vegetable  and  animal  Substances are certainly infinitly small  elastic  and  ductile  in separateing and  anatomiseing  them we can never come to an  End  and fine  Microscopes  will shew that even the very least our Senses can perceive or our Art divide are still Twists or  Tubuli  and compounded of an infinit Number of lesser and lesser  Threads  They are infinitly  elastic  for we find no Limits in their  Elasticity  the smaller and finer they are we find them growing still more  elastic  in the same Proportion and here also the  Progression  is without Stop or Limit  Elasticity  depending on the Degree of  Attraction  in the component  Particles  the  Elasticity  can never be stopt till we arrive at Particles infinitly  hard    indivisible  and  imporose  which no finite Power can produce and no finite Intelligence conceive and even in such there would be an infinitly small  Renisus  or  Reaction  of their Particles when compress'd so that all Fluids of whatever Nature and of whatever Degree of Rarity must have some Degree of  Elasticity  or  Reaction  Of such  Threads  the  Membranes  and of  these Membranes  the  Tubes  and Vessels of all  vegetable  and  animal  Substances seem compos'd I say not  mechanically  and according to the Laws of Nature that we see now they are govern'd by and accounted from but  supramechanically  compos'd and by the immediat Hand and Power or Influence of an  infinitly  wise and powerful  First Cause  Of these again I say are the  Tubuli  the Coats of the  Pipes  and all the other  vascular Apparatus  in fewer or more  Pipes    according to their Use and Necessity compos'd The  Fluids  are only design'd to keep them in a proper Degree of  Moisture  and  Glibness  to continue their necessary  Tone  and due Degree of  Elasticity  All the pleasant easy and healthful Sensations of  Life  depend chiefly on these Fluids Little can be effected by  Art  or  Medicin  on the Solids and their  linear Fibres  A temporary Constriction only a transient  winding up  a Fit of tolerable Health and Flow of Spirits may be gain'd by  astringent  cordial Medicins but it is  Regimen  alone by rendering the  Fluids  sweet soft cool and  balsamic  that enable the  Solids  to  play  according to their  innate  Powers that can give dureable and uniform good Health and keep these  Solids  as they were at first form'd in a proper  Tone    Glibness  and  Elasticity  § WE are not to conceive as if the  Author  of Nature created Things in the Order and in the Manner we can only now apprehend or explain them They were in Him but  one  single Act of his  Omnipotence  and  Omniscience  for us to understand them in any tolerable manner if at all we can we must  divide  them into different  Parts  and Parcels and form an  Idea  of them by different  Acts  of our Imagination For Example Suppose  Matter  divided into  solid    imporose    infinitly little Cubes    triangular equilateral  Prisms  and  Spheres    harmoniously  rang'd and united at first by some Law of  Attraction  and fram'd by a Divine  Mechanism  into  organical  Bodies somehow  analogous  and similar to those which  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings are now cloathed with with this only Difference that besides their being now  cas'd  over with the gross porous Matter of this  ruinous Planet  several additional temporary  Organs  to fit them for their changeing Situations may be added which in other Situations may  drop  off and dry away as we see in the  Placenta  and  umbilical  Vessels of the  Foetus  and the different temporary  Apparatus  of the  Silkworm  and other  Insects  into which the  First Cause  inspired an  infinitesimal Sparkle  and  Miniature  of his own Substance and natural and moral  Attributes  to actuate and govern this  Microcosm  in the same  analogous  but in an infinitly lower manner as He presides over and actuates the  Universe  This  aethereal  Body being then supple and pliable to the actuating  spiritual  Substance as  it  was to the Divine Influence but being  free  and  fallible  innumerable Multitudes of them by  spurious Selflove  and inordinat Love of the Creatures and created Pleasures actually  lapsed  fell into Rebellion and Disorder and so brought on the Necessity of this present State and the gross  penitential  Appearances of this ruinous  Planet  we now inhabit  § BODY and  Spirit  or material and spiritual Substances will eternally be  disparata  if not  contradictory  yet intirely  dissimilar  and contrary and at an infinit Distance in their Natures and Substances Body will be eternally  passive  and inert  Spirit  eternally  selfactive  and  selfmoveing  or endow'd with an internal  Principle  of acting on or moveing Matter all their  Relation  or  Reference  one towards another can only be known by  Analogy  and yet not being  contradictory  they might possibly be conceived of the Nature of  Hyperbola's  with their  Assymptots  For tho' the  Passivity  of Body be in Proportion to its  Density  yet since Body cannot be actually  infinit  in its Quantity or Extent its  Passivity  or  Inertia  cannot be  infinit  but lessens as its  Density  does but still if its Density was suppos'd even  infinitly  small that will not make it  selfactive  it must actually become  Spirit  and pass thro' that Term  Notmatter  in its Progression before it can arrive at  Selfactivity  and then acquire the contrary Qualities as the  Series  + + + + + does and nothing  less  than infinit Power can reduce it to that State that is it must be actually brought to be  Notmatter  or an  immaterial  Substance before it can become active or  spiritual Substance  and so is as it were in the State of  parallel  Lines and not of an  Hyperbola  with  its  Assymptot  But still there is an  Analogy  between their Substances such an one tho's as is between  finite  and relative  infinit  or between the  least  and  greatest  Term of an infinit  convergent Series  § THE  Persians  of all the  Antients  seem to have had the least intolerable Notion  Idea  or  analogical  Picture on their Imaginations of  spiritual  Nature in conceiving it like  Light  or  Fire  If we suppose an indivisible infinitly  rare  Substance and endow it with infinit  Elasticity  and  Energy  with an  internal  Principle of Selfactivity or of  Selfmobility  we have the essential Attribute of  spiritual  Substance all its other Qualities will be as  Modifications  flowing from that  Root  for then  Understanding  or  Conception  will become only  analogous  to an intimat  Union    Contact  and Presence to every individual  Atom  or component Particle as it were of the  Object  conceived or understood  Reasoning  will be a progressive Performance of this  intellectual  Operation and compareing the  analogous  Parts or component  Particles  to one another  Love  or  Desire  will be a continued  Union  or  Contact  with the  Object  and so of the other  Modifications  of this internal Principle of  Selfaction  in an infinitly  rare  and indivisible  sentient  or  intelligent  Substance  Fire  or  Light  will then be the most  luminous  Resemblance or  analogical  Picture of  spiritual  Substance and Qualities especially if we take it as it is in its uncreated  Source  the  Divine Nature  for an infinitly  pure  perfect  simple  and  active    living  and  intelligent  Substance then it will become the best  analogical  Resemblance of the  Divine Substance  however faulty and deficient we can frame now as at present we are And small  Lamps    Globes  or Sparkles of  Light  or  Fire  kindled up voluntarily emitted or flowing from this infinit  Globe  of  Light  and  Love  will best represent particular spiritual Natures whose  Rays  tho' emitted with a  relatively  infinit  Velocity  will weaken and terminat in thicker and thicker  Darkness    Shade  or Want of  Fire  and  Light  which will best represent to us and furnish out the  Idea  of Body but still an imperfect one  Darkness  being only a Negation of  Light  But as the Rays of  Millions  of different  Flambeaux  may pass really tho' material through the  Eye  of a Needle without Resistance or Interfereing so spiritual Substances by a proper Penetration may conceive and comprehend according to their Capacity and Power their proper Objects and in this  analogical  Sense it may be understood that  universal Nature  or the  created Universe  may represent  GOD  's Body or his  Sensorium  and he may be called the  Soul  of the  Universe  as the  Planets  in our  System  may be term'd the Body the  Tabernacle  and  organical  Machin  of the  Sun  in all which tho' there will be eternal Impropriety and Disparity For the one is the  Cause  the other the  Effect  only the  One  is the  Artificer  the other the  Work  the one is a  living    spiritual  Substance the other dead Matter the one is  selforiginated  and necessarily existent the other is created deriv'd and dependent the one is the first and least  Term  the other as it were the greatest and last Term of an infinit divergeing  Series  but at an infinitly infinit Distance This is as far it would seem as our active Powers can go in their present State by themselves unless it be communicated and imprest by the  Source  from above by direct Sensation and Feeling on the  Spirit  § As the  selfmotive    selfactive  Power in spiritual Substance is the Source of  Intelligence  by its intimat  Penetration    Union  and Presence with the whole internal Substance of its comprehended  Object  so it is the sole Principle of  Liberty  and the true  miniature Image  of the  Deity  in short it is the very  Essence  of  spiritual  Nature and the  Root  of all its Qualities and Operations It may be limited in its Extent in its  elicit Acts  and circumscrib'd in its  Energy  but in its  Root    Faculty  and  essential  Nature in its  selfactive Base  it is infinit and unbounded A  Farthing  Candle is as truly Light and Heat  as the Body of the  Sun  and we may have vehement  Willings    Longings    Volitions  and  Velleities  and have an  innate  inherent Power to intend or remit our Wills  in infinitum  which no other Power can deprive us of but that which can  annihilat  us or turn us into another Nature It would seem to me that created  spiritual  Substance of all  Orders  and  Degrees  were  analogous  to the infinitly pure and perfect Divine  spiritual Substance  infinitly  diluted  or  rarefied  as it were like the Light and Heat of the  Sun  reflected from the  Moon  and this in an infinit  similar Progression  becomeing rarer and more diluted till it terminated in  Darkness  or  Shade  thicker and grosser till it becomes like  Matter  which is  analogous  to  Shade  or  Darkness  and which too goes on  in infinitum  thickning and incrassating to become quite inert and passive so that laying aside created Substance both  material  and  spiritual  as quite  unknown  and  unknowable  and of which we can have no  Idea à priori  nor be certain of its Existence but  à posteriori  and from its  Effects  or the  divine Veracity  if we conceive  spiritual  Substance  analogous  to  Fire  or  Light  infinitly  pure    rare    selfactive  and  selfmotive  and  material  Substance  analogous  to  Shade  or  Darkness  infinitly  dense    compact  and  concentred  we shall have all that I think can be made of  either  in this our present State and as  Darkness  contracts and limits  Light extinguishes or imbibes its  elicit  Rays so  Body  or  Matter  limits and stops the Selfactivity of  spiritual  Nature and they are an eternal  Bar  and Obstacle on one another as Matter of a  proper  Figure and Contexture of Parts condenses and heightens the Action of  Fire  and  Light  so  divinely organis'd  and  harmoniously  figur'd  Vehicles  may promote the  elicit  Acts of  spiritual  Natures and the  Analogy  to Fire Light and Darkness will hold good then through all the Degrees of compareing It may be said that all this is but  Figure  but I think all true  Figure  is but remote  Analogy  and all true  Analogy  is a distant progressive  Approximation  to  Reality  and both are as real the one as the other and differ only as the  first  and  last  Terms of a  Series  § THE  Purification  of the  Soul  is perfectly  analogous  to the  Cure  of the  cacochymical  and  cadaverous  State of the  Body  and the  Method  of  Cure  of  spiritual  Nature takeing in the different Subjects  Matter  and  Spirit  is perfectly  similar  to the  Methodus metasyncriticus  of the  Ancients  in the Cure of a  Cachexy  in the  Body  The  Analogy  is here perfect and complete they differ only as the  first  and subsequent  Terms  of a  geometrical divergent Progression Sin    Disorder  and  Rebellion  is to the  spiritual  Nature of an  intelligent  Being precisely and really as much  as they are both  Realities  what a  cancerous  and  malignant Ulcer  is to an  animal  Body The  Cure  of the  last  is by a  low    sweetning  and  thinning Dyet  at first to enable the  Patient  to bear the  last  Operation which must be by  Excision  and  Extirpation  and raiseing new  sound  Flesh in its Place  Penitence    Selfdenial    calm Passions  a  meek Spirit  and a constant patient Attendance to and Dependence on the  Directions  of the  Physician  of  Souls  will answer the first Part and I am of Opinion  he  the  Divine Physician  of  Souls  by his omnipotent Power and his being  GOD    he  I say must perform  supernaturally  and  instanteously  as it were for a sweetning Cure of such inveterat  Humours  alone would require  infinit Time  some  grand  Operation in which the Creature is intirely  passive    analogous  to  Excision  and  Extirpation  to divide between the  Joints and Marrow  to cut out the  Adamical Core  in  lapsed  spiritual Nature and to raise up ingraft and implant his own  Nature  and  Substance  in its stead to perpetuat and  eternise  its Soundness and Integrity not in a  Figure  or  Metaphor  as is commonly tho' I think  barbarously    philosophised  but at last and in the  dernier Resort  and before the  hyperboloid Curve  to speak so can meet with its  Assymptot  as really and truly as  Matter  and  Spirit  are Realities tho' of different Natures  In the Day thou eatest thereof    thou shalt surely die  In the  Sense that Death came by  Adam  Death spiritual was completed by one Action of the of the Parentage of Mankind so by some one miraculous Operation  eternal Life  comes by  Jesus Christ  I can never apprehend that the  Oeconomy  the Operation the Efficiency of  Jesus  terminats either in  Example    Repair  of the Indignity confirming the standing  Hierarchies  cooperating with us in destroying bad Humours and Habits gradually or makeing a sufficient free and full  Atonement  only but that he must  supernaturally  and really cut out burn away and fill up and supply as it were with his own  spiritual  Substance the  Adamical cadaverous Core  out of lapsed  spiritual  Nature to sanctify and  eternise  its Purity Perfection and Happiness and this as really tho' not  materially  but  spiritually  I say as really as  Spirit  is real contradistinguish'd from  Matter  I choose to speak in the  Mathematical  and  Medical  Language because the  Analogy  the  Similarity  and the  Precision  is here so just so close and so luminous that I think it must penetrat those who can perfectly understand it and may by a  Dictionary  be made plain to others if they think it worth the while to deal in such  abstracted Conjectures  § THE  human Spirit  is literally and not in a mere Figure a  Tabula rasa  a  Sheet of white Paper  as it comes into the World at present under its  planetary  Plaistering and  it would seem for this very End the Plaistering itself was design'd and the gross porous  secondary Elements  of this  ruinous Planet  were by infinit Wisdom contriv'd not but that  spiritual  Nature in its Order and in its natural and  essential  Powers of  living    understanding  and  willing  and all their Modifications of Sagacity  Penetration  and  Conduct  and a Capacity of perceiveing outward Things and of gathering the Materials on which they work of external Objects  Ideas  and Knowledge of Things are not in their Fund in the Faculty and Power unalterably the same and as it were engrav'd in their Substance according to their Order for  spiritual  Nature cannot  increase  or  diminish  in its  essential  Powers and Capacity but their  elicit  Acts their Appearances  ad extra  may be intercepted and restrained from  issuing forth  by the gross  planetary Plaistering  like  Characters  and  Inscriptions  engrav'd in the Substance of  Brass  or  Marble  and filled up with  Wax    Clay  or  Dirt  or like the imperceptible  Ink  which leaves no Trace on the white Paper but shews itself when rubb'd over with  Juice of Lemon  Thus the immaterial  thinking  Substance is laid asleep becomes thoughtless and as it were  stupefied  a bare polisht  Plain  and a Sheet of  clean Paper  its three natural Powers of  living    understanding  and  willing  are sunk in one of  living  only a mere  Recipient  or  Continent  and as it were without Ridicule  a  dark Lanthorn  in the  Loins  of the Parent and as it comes first into the World but still the  selfactive  and  selfmotive Flame  is alive within in its Seed and its  Punctum saliens  External Objects Pain natural Instincts and Necessities rub off some of the improper Plaistering and break some of the  Ligatures  these repeated and increas'd unloose more and thus the  Organs  of  Sensation  the  Apertures  of the Senses and the  sentient  and  instructive  Powers are gradually set free and the  Dirt  pickt out of the spiritual Substance then Memory and Attention awakens and  Ideas  are form'd and retain'd by Time and Degrees By the  Animal Functions  which flow from  living  more and more of the  membranous Tubuli  and  medullar  and  cortical Glands  of the Brain are develop'd and the selfmotive Powers by repeated Efforts Strains and Pushes like a Spring in the Box of a Watch set free more and more of  aethereal Organs  of  Thinking  according to the Degree of  Culture    Exercise  and Useage they pass under and this by a quicker or slower  Progression  and Velocity as they are cultivated used and exercis'd till they come to the highest State they generally arrive at and thus by Labour and Exercise of the  Organs  of the  intellectual  Faculties they work off the  Dirt  that fill'd up the ingrav'd  Characters  on their  spiritual  Substances and make the  imperceptible Writeing  appearing legible merely  by fileing off and scrapeing away the  Plaistering  on the primitive  aethereal Vehicle  whereby the  spiritual  Substance is set free directly to enjoy and use all its  inbred Powers  and has Capacity to perceive all Things  ad extra  know understand and possess them not as a  blind  Man restored to his Sight or a  deaf  Man to his Hearing or a  dumb  Man to his  Speech  who were born so but as a Man for a short time shut up in a  Dungeon  and separated from all things without and again set at Liberty knows and enjoys all again as before And the  final Cause  of this reduceing the spiritual Substance to a  Tabula rasa  by a gross Plaistering and a temporary Imprisonment in the dark dismal cadaverous  Dungeon  of this Body seems to be not only for  Expiation  and  Punishment  but that the  moral Powers  of the Soul  Justice    Goodness  and  Truth  or  Faith    Hope  and  Charity  might feel no Interruption from the  Activity  Extent and Contrariety of these natural Powers but that they might amicably gradually and by  mutual  Assistance and Support rise and grow together in similar  Steps  and a regulated  Progression  till they were confirm'd into a  Habit  like sweetning the whole Mass of the Fluids by a  milk  or  vegetable  Diet to fit the Subject for the last  passive grand Operation  in the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  which may be to cut out as it were of our spiritual Substances that  Core    schirrous  or  cancerous Gland  generated by the  Lapse  and from the  Adamical  Principle and to heal and fill it up with his own  immaculat Substance  perhaps really and truly as the Liturgy of the  Church of England  expresses it communicated to us in the  worthy  receiveing of the  Sacrament  of the  Body  and  Blood  of  Jesus  or somehow we cannot explainThis  Effect  will neither appear absurd nor  unphilosophical  to those who believe  Jesus  to be the  Son of God  of the same  Substance  and  equal  Powers with the  Father  the Manner how is the proper Subject of  Faith  unconceiveable to us at least as we are at present but the  Fact  in general or something of that kind highly probable from  Analogy  and evident from  Revelation  For I think no truly  humble Christian  let him be in what State of  Perfection  he may can think himself fit to be  united  and  commerciat  eternally with infinit  Purity  and  Perfection  till some great Work be done in his  Soul  more than he feels in himself then  § MOST  Christians  at least are agreed that the  Oeconomy  of the  Restoration  as contriv'd and executed by  Jesus Christ    GodMan  the eternal Son of  GOD  as far as it was possible on his Part and as far as it was consistent with  Liberty  and the  Harmony  of the Divine Attributes I say all  Christians  are agreed that this was a Work of surprizeing  Wisdom    Beauty    Goodness  and worthy of  a  GOD  having in it to the greatest Perfection every thing that could most effectually answer the  End  proposed But I know not if many have endeavour'd to shew it to be the  and the only  one  that could possibly answer that End takeing in the whole  Conditions  and yet I cannot help thinking that this may be strictly  demonstrated  A  Sovereign  may pardon on his Repentance and Amendment a  rebellious  Subject and receive him into  Grace  and Favour but it will be eternally true he has been a  Rebel  and that there remains the  Cicatrice  of that Sore in his  Heart  and  Soul  which first produced his  Rebellion  Now it is as certain as that  GOD  is that nothing  impure  and imperfect in its  Order  can  finally  invariably and eternally be united and  commerciat  with Him that is be permanently and eternally  happy  because of his infinit Purity Dignity and Sovereignty and the receiveing an imperfect  intelligent  Being into his Favour Service and design'd  Post  again permanently or one less  similar  to Him in its Order would not only  sully  his Purity but make Him cheaper and less intensely the  sovereign Felicity  of the standing  Hierarchies  and make his Wrath less dreaded and so not a sufficient Bar on their  Lapse  Now every  Truth  and every  Fact  is in its own Nature as  eternal  as it is  real  It will be eternally true I have been a  Rebel  if I have been one and  GOD  alone who has the Power of  Creation    has the Power of  Annihilation  and this  Fact  as far as a Fact can be at least as to its Root must be  annihilated  and done away somehow before it can be  creaturely  and  relatively  true that I was not a  Rebel  or at least that my  Rebellion  is really now both as to  Him  and  me  as it never had been which can only be done as far as I conceive by  annihilating    burning  out  consumeing  the rebellious  Core  of my  spiritual  Substance and filling it up with something  analogous  to his pure immaculat  Divine Nature  and Substance or new createing and nothing less than a  GOD  can do this So that on Repentance and Amendment Men might be in the Condition only of  Rebels  whose Lives conquering  Monarchs  have saved yet instead of continuing them  Citizens  had translated them into some remote Corner of an uncultivated Country as a conquer'd Province and made them a lower  Order  of Creatures But as  infinit  Perfection is without any possible Change in its first most perfect Intention as to its Nature but not as to its Degree and can only bring it about less immediatly and after a longer Time by reason of the  Freewills  of his  intelligent  Creatures on which He neither can nor will commit Violence yet still will effect it with a Perfection at last beyond even as it were the first Intention accordingly  Jesus Christ  came to bring  Life  and to bring it more  abundantly  and by his infinit  Power  and  Love  being  GOD  to  annihilat  melt down and burn away the  Adamical Lapse    Core  and  Cicatrice  of Sin and Rebellion in spiritual Nature and new create and replace his own  Divine Substance  and Nature in its stead so that it may then be said with  philosophick  Propriety that a truly  regenerat  and  sanctified  Person has the  Divine Nature  and Substance of  Jesus    GODMan  actuating and moving him that is  living  in him as really and substantially as ever before his  Adamical  lapsed  Spirit  lived in him This may sound  odd  and particular to  little Philosophers  nay even to many perhaps virtuous and good Persons but as I think it is the Language of St  Paul  and of  Jesus Christ  himself I think also that if there is not some  Reality  and  philosophic  Propriety in it as real as is the Distinction between  material  and  spiritual  Substance and that it is not intirely all  Figure  there is no forming any  Idea  either of the  or  of it and even  Figure  in  philosophic  Propriety is but the first  Term  of an infinit  Series  nor why it should have been revealed or mentioned Nor will there be much Difficulty insuperable in it or unexplicable in  Philosophy  to those who admit  Jesus  to be  GOD  and his Words to be  Spirit  and  Truth  and  GOD  to be infinit in Power and Goodness the End and Means of all whose  Actings  must be equally perfect in their  Order  and who suppose that Matter and Spirit must be equal Realities This  last State  I resemble to the  Hyperbolic Curve  's meeting with  its  Asymptot  I hope I shall be forgiven the Particularity of the Expression because of its Justness and Propriety and it may be the finishing Operation to eternize the  Infallibility  and  Impeccability  of all lapsed sentient and intelligent Beings to which  few  arrive in this Life and all must perhaps pass through many  Mansions  and various  planetary Vehicles  before they can attain to  it  in its last Perfection and to which some pass with a quicker Velocity and a faster convergeing Progression like the several Orders of the  Hyperloids  some of which meet the  Asymptot  infinitly sooner and faster than others  Vide  Philosophical Principles of Reveal'd Religion  but through which all must pass sooner or later for  GOD  's Ways must be equal uniform and general to all his Creatures of the same  Order  with only the Difference their  general  or  particular  Wants or Distempers require and as He treated the Manhood of  Jesus Christ    who was made perfect by Sufferings  and as He has treated all his  Disciples  so all  lapsed  intelligent Beings must pass through  Jesus Christ  receive his  Revelation  and go through his  States  sooner or later or in some  Mansion  or another before they arrive at perfect  Infallibility  and  Illability  that is they must first or last all be  Jesus Christlike  before they can become permanently  GODlike  or similar to Him in Perfection and Happiness This Progression  and  final  Perfection the  Freewills  of intelligent Beings may retard a finite Time and they might have retarded it from  Eternity  to  Eternity  that is for ever both in the  eternal  Nature of  Sin  and the infinit Purity of the  Divine Nature  without this  sole  and  individual  Mean  viz  the  Merits    Power  and  Efficacy  of the  Oeconomy  of  Jesus  the  GODMan  who uniteing  human  Nature to Himself has actually really but spiritually cut out the  Core  and  Cicatrice  of the  Lapse  and filled up the  discontinuous  Void with his own  spiritual Substance  and Nature in all those who shall be finally restored for  He is the Way    the Truth    and the LIFE  §  REASON  and  Faith  in their true  philosophic  Natures in their Source and Foundation are so far from being  contrary  much less  contradictory  that they are intirely  similar  and  analogous  and differ only as the higher and lowest Terms of a  divergeing Series Reason  in its  Principle  and  Faculty  in the lowest Intelligence is like a  Progression  the first  Term  of which is the  Root  or  miniature Base  of all the higher subsequent  Terms  which are all  similar  and  analogous  to one another how compounded and elevated soever they may be and where the superior  Terms  virtually include the inferior and bring them down to the Simplicity and Plainness of the  lowest Term  but not without Labour Attention  and Reduction of the  Conditions  to their proper Limits  GOD  is the  Sovereign  and  Supreme Reason  involved in Clouds and Darkness by reason of his infinit  Splendor  and the infinit Disproportion of our Faculties and perhaps out of Designs of Love and Goodness as we are at present in so unfit a State Our  Reason  and Conception tho' infinitly disproportion'd to such an  Object  yet is of a  similar  Nature with his Light and natural  Attributes  Our  Reason  and intelligent Powers are  analogous  to the lowest and first  Term  of such a Progression his  Light  and  Splendor  to the  highest  and  last  great  Term  which  Term  in a  Series  tho' comparatively  infinit  yet is but a  finite  compared with his absolute  Infinitude  The other  Terms  of such a  Series  may be  analogous  to the natural Powers of the several different  Orders  of Intelligences that may exist in external Nature and all the several  Orders  of Intelligences with their respective Powers from the lowest to the relative highest may be continually approaching one another yet never can reach the other  Terms  much less the last  Term  relative infinit and least of all to absolute  Infinitude  for in absolute  Infinitude  there is such Variety of  Objects    Mansions    Pleasures  and  Happiness  as are boundless and without Number or Limits  GOD  is the sovereign and supreme  Reason  I say always consistent uniform and invariable He is  pure    unsullied    and unchangeable  Creatures  even the most sublime and perfect can only know Him by a  progressive  nearer Approach to Him in  Similarity  which will be gradual but endless The Faculties Powers and Qualities both  Natural  and  Moral  of Creatures are as it were but  analogous  to speak still more plainly to a  Series  such as + + + +  c  We of the human Race at least our Fellow  Animals  of the only  sentient  Race may be as or the higher  Orders  may be as  c  to us At what  Term  we began or any Order begins we cannot know nor did we know could we alter it that depends intirely on the good Pleasure and Wisdom of Him that made us In this Point we cannot add a  Cubit to our Stature  but we may all press forward to higher Terms and Degrees and be continually  progressive  tho' perhaps mostly in our  moral  Powers and consequently in Perfection and Happiness which can be done by  Faith  only that is by  trusting  to believing in and acting according to the Direction given by  one  whose natural and moral Powers are of a much higher  Order  or in Proportion to a much higher  Term  than ours are As if  one  whose natural and moral Powers are as should reveal to one whose natural and moral Powers are as only that in order to raise his natural and moral Powers to he must trust or believe that is take his Word for it  so  and  so  and do  so  and  so  in Consequence  and that this will lead him on gradually to the  Term  and so in all the other  Terms  of the  Progression  This really seems to be somewhat like the Case of all  sentient  and  intelligent  Beings in order to advance in this  eternal Progression  of Perfection the only Method possible for them is to  trust  and  act  in Consequence of this Trust and depend on the Veracity and Ability of the Informer for this trusting is in order to the acting In  building  or working or  sailing  a  Ship  to a certain  Port  the  Seaman  must  trust  and work according to his Directions In raising an  Arch  or measuring a  Distance  very few Operators understand the abstract  Geometry  on which the Directions are founded In short in this our present  expiatory  and  probatory  State in all we do to advance towards higher  Terms  of our  progressive  Perfection and Happiness we must absolutely  trust  and  work  else we shall never advance in divine  Faith  and in the progressive Perfection of our natural and moral Powers and here we have not only  infinit  Power and Wisdom for our  Director  but infinit  Goodness  for our Assistant who yet from the Purity and Perfection of his own Nature cannot  direct  or assist us but in Consistence with the  Harmony  of his own  Attributes  and our own  Freewills  i e imperceptibly Our intellectual Powers are  analogous  to our material  Organs  our Senses  One  with a  Telescope  or with very strong  Eyes  might see a  City  or a Dwelling which another without it or with weaker Eyes could not perceive If the  weaksighted  Person must needs go to this  City  or Dwelling he could only take the Directions of the strongersighted on what  Point  of the  Compass  to direct his Course what  Hills    Dales  and  Rivers  to cross to walk on  Trust  and  Hope  Our  trusting  is in order to our travelling  Faith  or  Trust  that does not terminat in Action or Travelling is mere  Painting  and dead Work  Revelation  discovers the Being Purity and Perfection of the  First Cause  his internal Nature and the Splendor He dwells in what is his  Society  and what their Occupation that to be happy completely and permanently we must get thither We while our Powers natural and moral are but as or cannot see or perceive the Beauty Perfection of his Nature and the Place He inhabits nor the Propriety of the  Directions  and Advices He gives us in order to get thither The Nature of things will not admit of any other Evidence but  Faith  and  Trust  and consequent working till our  natural  and  moral  Powers are thereby rais'd higher and then we shall perfectly comprehend the Beauty Propriety and Utility of these Directions and advance gradually by following the same Method to higher  Terms  of Powers and Faculties and higher Degrees of Glory and Felicity in this infinit endless  Progression  From all  which it is evident that  Reason  and  Faith  are so far from being contrary much less contradictory that  Reason  is the first  Term  given in this Progression of created Light or Powers  Faith  or Trust is as it were the  Ratio  of the several  Terms  which goes through them all that is the Ground or Bottom of the subsequent Operation and Working By the Directions given and Working we infallibly pass to the second third and higher  Terms  Or to express it yet more strongly and clearly if possible  Faith  or  Trust  is proceeding as we do in  Algebra  supposing the second or higher  Term  tho'  unknown  yet as  known  and then working according to the Conditions of the Question the  Term  unknown becomes thereby infallibly known I cannot enlighten these Figures and this Language here they are so pertinent and cogent to those who understand them  §  PURE  and disinterested  Love  is  Love  of infinit Perfection for itself  only  and for its own  Amiableness  without any other Consideration but this as every thing else admits of infinit Degrees The great Mistake here lies in Persons pretending to get to the Top of the Ladder without ascending by all the Steps and that some define the  last  Step as it were the  first  All things belonging to Creatures must be progressive and confirm'd Habits must be acquired by repeated persevereing Acts  Naked    free  and generous  Faith  is trusting confideing  and  believeing  in  Infallibility  and infinit  Veracity  upon its own  Word  its  Nature  only and on the most slender Intimation of its Orders the  generous Believer  is determin'd to venture his  Whole  on that Bottom And from these  two  flow absolute  Resignation  and this also admits of  Degrees  Both these are subject to  Error  Mistake and Delusion in feeble  lapsed  Mortals such as we are and this cannot be prevented from the very Nature of Things as they are now in our  probatory  and  penitential  State constituted but surely there is less Danger in the  Excess  than the  Defect  No  good Master  ever rejected or punished his poor goodnatur'd weak  Servant  for loveing and trusting him too much or obeying him too  precisely  or literally I readily grant  Prudence    Order    Measure    Decency  and  Regularity  are the first of all the Moral and  Christian  Virtues and frightful Consequences have ensued upon the Neglect of them and both  Enthusiasm  and  Infidelity  I think equally imply a wrong Head some  nervous  Disorder and Want of  common Sense  but both  Excesses  and  Defects  strongly evidence that there is a just  Medium  wherein  true  Virtue and sole  Right  consist And still of the  two  Evils  Infidelity  and  Tepidity  is infinitly the worst not only in regard of the  Infidels  and  Tepid  themselves as it defeats the  sole  Means  Providence  has or I think can contrive for their  Recovery  and  Restoration  but as it destroys Numbers of  weak Souls  by its Influence  and Example and as  Infidelity saps  the Foundations of all  Morality  and consequently of all  civil Society  whereas  Enthusiasm  can but hurt chiefly the Bodies or outward Fortunes of their Fellow Creatures by  diabolic  and tyrannical  Persecution  unless  Hypocrisy  can be join'd to  Enthusiasm  and then it becomes consummat  Infidelity  To me it would seem the whole Conduct and Design of Providence in this present probationary State is to produce in the Hearts of his lapsed Creatures  pure Love  and  naked Faith  only and that  this  is the sole  Key  of all the Inclosures of his Providence and that this State of Mind must be that which alone is of any Value in the Sight of GOD as being the only Means possible of begetting perfect  Felicity  and  eternizeing  it even so much as that  He  in his Providence seems to neglect or overlook and undervalue as it were any thing less than  these  at least any thing that might retard or interfere with  these  An Instance or two will make this plain We see that we of the lowest  Rank  of Intelligences are endow'd with a  Capacity  and Power of communicating our  Thoughts    Conceptions  Dispositions and Sentiments to one another directly plainly and intelligibly by  Language  or Writeing and by many other  Signs    Symbols  and Figures  Infinit  Wisdom and Power without all Doubt had he so pleased might have contriv'd us so at present that  he  might have been able somehow to communicat  himself  directly    plainly  instantaneously and intelligibly to all his  intelligent  Creatures his Children the Work of his own Hands whom he cannot help loveing as a tender  Father  does his  Children  But since this Method not only would have done us no  Good  but on the contrary a great deal of  Hurt  by hindering and interfereing with our implicit  Trust  our  Reliance  our  Resignation  our  Faith  and absolute Dependence on him so necessary to the Production and  eternizeing  of perfect Happiness we see he hides himself in  Clouds  and  Darkness  and is literally a  Deus absconditus  as to us and does only approach to or commerciat with us in  pure Love    naked Faith  and total Abnegation and Resignation so hard to be acquired Again how necessary how indispensable would seem the  precise  the limited the unmistakeable Nature of natural and moral  Good  and  Evil  to us in our present probatory State and yet we are left for the Knowledge of  them  to  Feeling  to  Observation  to  Experience  to  Culture  to  Pain  and  Suffering  The  wisest  of mere Men said  That no Man knoweth Good or Evil by all that is before him  We naturally reckon  Health    Wealth    Honour  and  Success  the real the only Goods of this Life and yet if  Christianity  is not all a  Farce  their Contraries are often nay almost always the most real and the most perfect Goods since they are  the shortest Road to absolute  Resignation  the greatest of all  Goods  and the sole Mean of perfect Happiness Once more infinit Wisdom and Power has as it were done nothing to gratify our Curiosity to  polish  our Natures to advance the  Comforts  and  Gratifications  the  Conveniencies  and the honest  Improvements  of  Living  How many  Nations  and  Millions  of our own  Species  of the same Order and Rank of Intelligences are left all their Lives in the utmost  Brutality    Ignorance  and  Savageness  not only as to the  Endowments  of their Minds but almost as to the absolute at least decent Necessaries of Life in which  Cimmerian  Darkness and execrable bodily Impurity or Filth they wallow live and die even vastly below many of the  Brute Species  The most useful pleasant and instructive  Discoveries  in Life have even among the most  polisht  Nations been discover'd  late  by  Chance  and with great Imperfections at  first  I mean  Writeing    Printing  the  Compass  and  Glasses  and even  Philosophical Physic  itself All this cannot happen by Chance  Fatality  from Impotence or without some infinitly wise and gracious  Design  under the  Oeconomy  and Providence of an infinitly good  wise  and  powerful Governor  who alone knows best  how long  and what Kind of  Trial  and  Probation  is fittest for his lapsed intelligent Creatures of such  Tribes    Nations  and  Climats  to what Degree  they have  lapsed  what is their most proper Trial how far  Simplicity  and even  actual Humiliation  of this  intelligent  Creature made a little lower than the  Angels  in his natural unalterable  Powers  and as it were to  drench  him in Dirt and  Nastiness  even below the lowest  Brute  as  Compost  fructifies Vegetables is the  Via brevissima  and Suffering even  unconscious  Suffering is sufficient and knows best what  Mansion  they are design'd to inhabit hereafter and has fitted  outward  Circumstances accordingly And as to what is commonly reckon'd  polishing  and haveing the decent Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life he leaves Men to their natural  Liberty  and  Industry  to employ their natural  Activity  innocently and laudably thereby which otherwise might run riot in  Turpitude  and  Vice  and to  general Laws  which followed with  Simplicity    Attention  and  Sincerity  would naturally bring them perhaps the shortest Way to  disinterested Love    implicit Trust  and  Resignation  and this he does even with a seeming Neglect of those other Things as accounting them of no Value when compar'd with this  pure Love  and  implicit Trust  that Disposition of Mind which alone can beget and  eternize  Happiness Further of what great Consequence to the Quickness of our  Purification  and consequently of our  eternal Happiness  it would appear to us would be the certain Knowledge of the precise Time of our  Dissolution  and  Death  Then like true penitent and serious  Felons  we should employ all our last Moments intirely  in cleansing our Vessels and  trimming our Lamps  and yet all that is known in this weighty Affair is  general  and that we once must all die The  Time  the  Manner  and other Circumstances are all absolutely unknown to us and why this but only because infinit Purity and Perfection values nothing about us but absolute  Trust    Dependence  and  Resignation  even to venturing our very  Lives  and as our  Saviour  expresses it if we do not  hate  that is undervalue our own Life in respect of  him  or love it but in  Subordination  to our Love of Him we cannot be his  Disciples  Again the  Providence  of  GOD  seems to act  here  solely by  second Causes  and by  general Laws  only and in such a manner that we but seldom  perceptibly  discern the Hand that disposes of  Events  tho' doubtless as  GOD  is an  infinitly free Agent  He governs by a particular as well as a general Providence on proper and particular Occasions He dispenses with his own general Laws for a time by a particular Interposition both in  material  and  spiritual  Appearances But in these particular  Interpositions  we can have no  physical  but only a  moral  Certainty in order to raise and confirm our  Trust  and  Resignation  for  Faith    Trust  and  Resignation  always suppose Uncertainty and Doubt and some time or other we shall admire and adore that  Wisdom  and  Goodness  who could in so delicat and kindly a  manner  conceal from us and hide that Hand which directs every  Atom  of the  Universe  and disposes of every  Hair of our Heads  in order to render our  Trust    Faith  and  Resignation  stronger and more firm As the Darkness and Cool of the  Autumn  Nights are what harden and consolidat the now refined and purified Juices which the stronger  Sun  and longer Daylight had rais'd and sublim'd into the  Seeds  and  Fruits  for the same Reason the  Operations  and Influences of the Divine  Spirit  or  Grace  and spiritual Aid and Assistance are  secret  and  imperceptible  and are always to be suspected when they are  impetuous    sensible  and acting only by  Fits  and  Starts  as the gross Machin is  in  or  out  of  Tune  and as the animal Functions play  easily  or  labour  especially in  young unexperienced  Persons who have not been  tried  and  purified  in the School of the  Cross  For these uncommon and  extraordinary  or even  perceptible  Operations of the  Divine Spirit  seldom happen  pure    sincere  and  unmixt  but to the long and severely  Tried  and  Purified  and when the Passions Appetites and  spiritual Humours  are moderated calm'd and subdued on the Decline of a Life spent in due Retirement and proper Silence not in the  Storm  or  Tempest  but in the  still calm Voice  does the Divine  Spirit  speak and a truly humble and enlighten'd Person ought to suspect himself  get above  and pass over every  Impulse    Sweetning  or  Glance  of Light that comes not thus accompanied Children Beginners and Noviciats in the  spiritual Life  are often gratified  with such  Sugarings  for their Encouragement but Bread is for grown Persons which is got by the  Sweat of the Brow  and bearing the  Cross  and a prudent staid Person will have too great a Regard for the Purity and Dignity of the  Divine Spirit  to bring him down to account for all the  mechanical  and  animal  Operations of his  volatile  and various  Imagination Nec Deus intersit    nisi sit Deo dignus vindice nodus    aquila non captat muscas  But I beg Pardon for this Digression out of my Sphere Capacity and Experience to treat justly But all the Difficulties and Darkness in Providence and in natural and revealed Religion seem to be intended by infinit Wisdom with surprizeing Justness  Propriety  and  Delicacy    only  as the most effectual  Means  to bring us to pure  Love  and naked  Faith    Trust  and  Resignation  and are so far from being  Objections  against the Christian  Religion  or to weaken its  Credibility    Dignity  and  Authority  that were there no such  Difficulties    Doubts    Uncertainties  and  Mysteries  in  Revelation  it would be a strong  Presumption  and an undeniable Argument that it came not from  GOD  who being  infinitly infinit  in all  Perfection    Wisdom    Knowledge  and  Goodness  must be incomprehensible to us in our present State and so they could not be worthy adequat and proper for such a  Being  who is equally above Perception Feeling and Sentiment as above Comprehension  These  may be good useful and real and his  mediat  but seldom his  immediat  Operation This pure  Love  and naked  Faith  seems to be the only  Point in View  of the great and wise  Governor  of the  Universe  even to such a Contempt of what we commonly think fine  Endowments  and  Polishing  that in a great many Instances in  Nations    Tribes  and for  Ages  he would seem in the Conduct of his Providence to prefer their Contraries as the  shortest Way  to this  End  tho' still there is a  Choice    Perfection  and  Meliority  in the  Honestum    Utile  and the  Decorum  but he only can know when where and in what outward Circumstances lies the    quoad hos aut hunc  § I TAKE it in the first original Creation there was but one universal  Salt  or one Kind of  saline  Particles and that they were hard  imporose    triangular    equilateral Prisms  When Nature came to be confounded jumbled and  unharmoniously  combin'd the other  Elements  of  Air    Water    Sulphur  and  Earth  in forming secondary  Elements  were  incommensuratly  and discordantly mixt with these but still each preserv'd some Degree of its  primitive  Nature as the compounded  Elements  retain'd more or less of their primitive  Particles  in the Composition hence our purest  Elements  that  Art  can elicit are still compounded and inseparable from the  rest  the purest most simple and most necessary of them all seems to be our pure  Nitre  or the universal  Salt  of the  Air  the Mother of all  Salts  so necessary to  animal  Life  Sanguification  the  Stimulation  of the animal  Fibres  the Propagation and Action  of  Heat  and  Fire  the Production of  Cold  and Freezeing to  animal Foecundity  and  Vegetation  and many other of the  Appearances  of Nature to which it seems absolutely necessary and enters into their Substance and Composition The other  Salts    Acids  and  Alcalis  the  essential  or lixivial  Salts  of Vegetables  Plants  and  Minerals  are only this primitive  nitrous Salt  combin'd with these other  Elements  and as they predomine and exist in these particular Subjects These mention'd  Salts  in  Animals  are  Nitre  mixt with animal  Oils    Air    Water  and  Earth  such as their Substances are compounded of and it is in the same Manner in the  Plants  and  Minerals  The greatest specific Difference among the  Salts  seems to arise from the Distinction of  Acids  and  Alcalis  the first both from  Philosophy  and  Experiment  seem to be of  acuteangled  greatly  attractive Particles  and the Degree of their  Acidity  seems to depend on the  proportional  Degree of the Sharpness of their  Points  which now may be various and their Degree of  Attraction  also  Alcalis  seem to be porous  calcarious  fine Earths the  testaceous Powders  are among the most simple and perfect of them and the Model of all the rest and plainly shew the Nature of the whole  Tribe  They are as is evident from the  Microscope  nothing but Earths of an exceeding fine Grain and of very small  Particles  full of large  Pores  and  Cells  wherein an  acid  Water or Spirit has been contain'd probably that of  Nitre  Heat  solar  or  culinary  and  Calcination    throws off some Part of this  acid  Water and leaves the  Cells  partially empty These empty  Cells  upon being immerged in any  acid  Spirit or Water suck it in again with Violence and Velocity the remaining Part of the  Acid  in the  Cells attracting  the new  Acid  with additional Force and hence  Fermentation  and  Effervescence  All the  Alcalis  partake of this one general Nature and differ only as they are more or less combin'd with the other  Elements Volatility  arises from a light  Oil  united with either Kinds of  Salts  and this seems to be the true  philosophic  Nature of all  Salts Salts  and  Air  seem absolutely necessary to carry on  animal  Life and Functions  Air  to rarefy the Juices separat the  Globules  which might otherwise be too closely united and compress'd for the Introduction of which into the Blood and Fluids the  Lungs  of  Animals  seem chiefly design'd  Salts  stimulat the Solids into  Actions    Vibrations  and excite their clumsy elastic Force in order to carry on the  animal Functions  so absolutely necessary to living The just and proper Regulation of these  two    Air  and  Salts  the so necessary Instruments of pleasant and easy living is as fit a Subject to be adjusted by a wise and  philosophic Physician  others are but  Empyrics  at the best as  Diet  and  Exercise  The  Air  we choose to live in ought to be rather dry and thin in the  Medium  but even this must be proportion'd to the Nature of the  Distemper  and the State of the  Juices  if possible and they who have acquir'd their  Disorders by high Meats and Drinks which abound in  volatile Salts  must by  insipid  Foods and  aqueous  Liquors lessen the Abundance of such Salts which is the Case of all the  Rich  and  Wealthy  They on the contrary who have acquir'd their Distempers by too  poor  and  low  a Manner of living on  vegetable  insipid and instimulating Food only which is the Case of most of the Poor or Indigent must be cured by more  generous  Living and more stimulating and sapid Meats and Drinks which excite their Solids into Action and on which account all  low Livers  who are driven into this Way of Living by the Nature of their Distempers require double the Exercise of those who can bear  generous  and  active  Foods and without it Nature will stagnat and sink which is the Case of many of the  Female Sex  and of Persons in  Gaols  and  Monasteries  In a Word whereever a low or vegetable Diet is necessary there  Air  and  Exercise  are in a much higher Degree necessary than they are in a more generous  Diet  to make a  low Diet  effectual But then the  high Feeders  pay in the Shortness of their Lives and the Sharpness of their Diseases for their present Pleasure and idle indolent healthy Life  FINIS  ERRATA  Page Line dele  with  p l for  gene  read  general  p for  affixing  r  of fixing  p from  higher
