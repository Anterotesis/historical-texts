 THE ACTOR A POETICAL EPISTLE  THE ACTOR A POETICAL EPISTLE TO  BONNELL THORNTON  Esq  Quocunque animum auditoris agunto  HOR  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  MDCCLX  THE ACTOR  ACTING dear  Bonnell  it's Perfection draws  From no Observance of mechanic Laws  No settled Maxims of a fav'rite Stage  No Rules deliver'd down from Age to Age  Let Players nicely mark them as they will  Can e'er entail hereditary Skill  If 'mongst the humble Hearers of the Pit  At some lov'd Play the old Man chance to sit  Am I pleas'd more because 'twas acted so  By  Booth  and  Cibber  thirty Years ago  The Mind recalls an Object held more dear  And hates the Copy that it comes so near  Why lov'd we  Wilks's  Air  Booth's  nervous Tone  In them 'twas natural 'twas all their own  A  Garrick's  Genius must our Wonder raise  But gives his Mimic no reflected Praise  Thrice happy Genius whose unrival'd Name  Shall live for ever in the Voice of Fame  'Tis thine to lead with more than magic Skill  The Train of captive Passions at thy Will  To bid the bursting Tear spontaneous flow  In the sweet Sense of sympathetic Woe  Through ev'ry Vein I feel a Chilness creep  When Horrors such as thine  have murder'd Sleep  And at the old Man's Look and frantic Stare  'Tis  Lear  alarms me for I see him there  Nor yet confin'd to tragic Walks alone  The comic Muse too claims thee for her own  With each delightful Requisite to please  Taste Spirit Judgment Elegance and Ease  Familiar Nature forms thy only Rule  From  Ranger's  Rake to  Drugger's  vacant Fool  With Powers so pliant and so various blest  That what we see the last we like the best  Not idly pleas'd at Judgment's dear Expence  But burst ourageous with the laugh of Sense  PERFECTION'S Top with weary Toil and Pain  'Tis Genius only that can hope to gain  The Play'r's Profession tho' I hate the Phrase  'Tis so  mechanic  in these modern Days  Lies not in Trick or Attitude or Start  Nature's true Knowledge is his only Art  The strongfelt Passion bolts into the Face  The Mind untouch'd what is it but Grimace  To this one Standard make your just Appeal  Here lies the golden Secret learn to FEEL  Or Fool or Monarch happy or distrest  No Actor pleases that is not  possess'd  ONCE on the Stage in  Rome's  declining Days  When Christians were the Subject of their Plays  Ere Persecution dropp'd her iron Rod  And Mortals wag'd an impious War with God  An Actor flourish'd of no vulgar Fame  Nature's Disciple and  Genest  his Name  A noble Object for his Skill he chose  A Martyr dying midst insulting Foes  Resign'd with Patience to Religion's Laws  Yet braving Monarchs in his  Saviour's  Cause  Fill'd with th' Idea of the sacred Part  He felt a Zeal beyond the reach of Art  While Look and Voice and Gesture all exprest  A kindred Ardour in the Player's Breast  Till as the Flame thro' all his Bosom ran  He lost the Actor and commenc'd the Man  Profest the Faith his pagan Gods denied  And what he acted then he after died  THE Player's Province they but vainly try  Who want these pow'rs  Deportment Voice  and  Eye  THE Critic Sight 'tis only  Grace  can please  No Figure charms us if it has not  Ease  There are who think the Stature all in all  Nor like the Hero if he is not tall  The feeling Sense all other Wants supplies  I rate no Actor's Merit from his Size  Superior Hight requires superior Grace  And what's a Giant with a vacant Face  THEATRIC Monarchs in their tragic Gait  Affect to mark the solemn Pace of State  One Foot put forward in Position strong  The other like its Vassal dragg'd along  So grave each Motion so exact and slow  Like wooden Monarchs at a PuppetShow  The Mien delights us that has native Grace  But Affectation ill supplies its Place  UNSKILFUL Actors like your mimic Apes  Will writhe their Bodies in a thousand Shapes  However foreign from the Poet's Art  No tragic Hero but admires a Start  What though unfeeling of the nervous Line  Who but allows his  Attitude  is fine  While a whole Minute equipoiz'd he stands  Till Praise dismiss him with her echoing Hands  Resolv'd though Nature hate the tedious Pause  By Perseverance to extort Applause  When  Romeo  sorrowing at his  Juliet's  Doom  With eager Madness bursts the canvass Tomb  The sudden Whirl stretch'd Leg and lifted Staff  Which please the Vulgar make the Critic laugh  TO point the Passion's Force and mark it well  The proper Action Nature's Self will tell  No pleasing Pow'rs Distortions e'er express  And nicer Judgment always loaths Excess  In Sock or Buskin who o'erleaps the Bounds  Disgusts our Reason and the Taste confounds  OF all the Evils which the Stage molest  I hate your Fool who overacts his Jest  Who murders what the Poet finely writ  And like a Bungler haggles all his Wit  With Shrug and Grin and Gesture out of Place  And writes a foolish Comment with his Face  Old  Johnson  once tho'  Cibber's  perter Vein  But meanly groupes him with a num'rous Train  With steady Face and sober hum'rous Mien  Fill'd the strong Outlines of the comic Scene  What was writ down with decent Utterance spoke  Betray'd no Symptom of the conscious Joke  The very Man in Look in Voice in Air  And though upon the Stage he seem'd no Play'r  The Word and Action should conjointly suit  But acting Words is labour too minute  Grimace will ever lead the Judgment wrong  While sober Humour marks th' Impression strong  Her proper Traits the fixt Attention hit  And bring me closer to the Poet's Wit  With her delighted o'er each Scene I go  Wellpleas'd and not asham'd of being so  'TIS not enough the  Voice  be sound and clear  'Tis Modulation that must charm the Ear  When desperate Heroines grieve with tedious Moan  And whine their Sorrows in a seesaw Tone  The same soft Sounds of unimpassioned Woes  Can only make the yawning Hearers doze  THE Voice all Modes of Passion can express  That marks the proper Word with proper Stress  But none emphatic can that Actor call  Who lays an equal Emphasis on  all  SOME o'er the Tongue the labour'd Measures roll  Slow and delib'rate as the parting Toll  Point ev'ry Stop mark ev'ry Pause so strong  Their Words like StageProcessions stalk along  All Affectation but creates Disgust  And e'en in speaking  We  may seem  too  just  Nor proper  Thornton  can those Sounds appear  Which bring not Numbers to thy nicer Ear  For them in vain the pleasing Measure flows  Whose Recitation runs it all to Prose  Repeating what the Poet sets not down  The Verb disjointing from its friendly Noun  While Pause and Break and Repetition join  To make a Discord in each tuneful Line  SOME placid Natures fill th' allotted Scene  With lifeless Drone insipid and serene  While others thunder ev'ry Couplet o'er  And almost crack your Ears with Rant and Roar  In so much Noise but little Sense is found  As empty Barrels make the greatest Sound  MORE Nature oft and finer Strokes are shown  In the low Whisper than tempestuous Tone  And  Hamlet's  hollow Voice and fixt Amaze  More powerful Terror to the Mind conveys  Than he who swol'n with big impetuous Rage  Bullies the bulky Phantom off the Stage  THE Modes of Grief are not included all  In the white Handkerchief and mournful Drawl  A single Look more marks th' internal Woe  Than all the Windings of the lengthen'd Oh  UP to the  Face  the quick Sensation flies  And darts its meaning from the speaking Eyes  Love Transport Madness Anger Scorn Despair  And all the Passions all the Soul is there  IN vain  Ophelia  gives her Flowrets round  And with her Straws fantastic strews the Ground  In vain now sings now heaves the desp'rate Sigh  If Phrenzy sit not in the troubled Eye  In  Cibber's  Look commanding Sorrows speak  And call the Tear fast trick'ling down my Cheek  HE who in Earnest studies o'er his Part  Will find true Nature cling about his Heart  All from their Eyes impulsive Thought reveal  And none can want Expression who can feel  THERE is a Fault which stirs the Critic's Rage  A Want of due Attention on the Stage  There have been Actors and admir'd ones too  Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue  In their own Speech who whine or roar away  Yet unconcern'd at what the rest may say  Whose Eyes and Thoughts on diff'rent Objects roam  Until the Prompter's Voice recall them home  DIVEST yourself of Hearers if you can  And strive to speak and be the very Man  Why should the wellbred Actor wish to know  Who sits above Tonight or who below  So mid th' harmonious Tones of Grief or Rage  Italian Squallers oft disgrace the Stage  When with a simp'ring Leer and Bow profound  The squeaking  Cyrus  greets the Boxes round  Or proud  Mandane  of imperial Race  Familiar drops a Curtsie to her Grace  TO suit the Dress demands the Actor's Art  Yet there are those who overdress the Part  To some prescriptive Right gives settled Things  Black Wigs to Murd'rers feather'd Hats to Kings  But  Michel Cassio  might be drunk enough  Tho' all his Features were not grim'd with Snuff  Why shou'd  Pol Peachum  shine in sattin Cloaths  Why ev'ry Devil dance in scarlet Hose  BUT in StageCustoms what offends me most  Is the Slipdoor and slowlyrising Ghost  Tell me nor count the Question too severe  Why need the dismal powder'd Forms appear  WHEN chilling Horrors shake th' affrighted King  And Guilt torments him with her Scorpion Sting  When keenest Feelings at his Bosom pull  And Fancy tells him that the Seat is full  Why need the Ghost usurp the Monarch's Place  To frighten Children with his mealy Face  The King alone should form the Phantom there  And talk and tremble at the vacant Chair  IF  Belvidera  her lov'd Loss deplore  Why for twin Spectres bursts the yawning Floor  When with disorder'd Starts and horrid Cries  She paints the murder'd Forms before her Eyes  And still pursues them with a frantic Stare  'Tis pregnant Madness brings the Visions there  More instant Horror would enforce the Scene  If all her Shuddrings were at Shapes unseen  POET and Actor thus with blended Skill  Mould all our Passions to their instant Will  'Tis thus when feeling  Garrick  treads th' Stage  The speaking Comment of his  Shakespear's  Page  Oft as I drink the Words with greedy Ears  I shake with Horror or dissolve with Tears  O ne'er may Folly seize the Throne of Taste  Nor Dulness lay the Realms of Genius waste  No bouncing Crackers ape the Thundrer's Fire  No Tumbler float upon the bending Wire  More natural Uses to the Stage belong  Than Tumblers Monsters Pantomime or Song  For other Purpose was that Spot design'd  To purge the Passions and reform the Mind  To give to Nature all the Force of Art  And while it charms the Ear to mend the Heart  Thornton  to Thee I dare with Truth commend  The decent Stage as Virtue's natural Friend  Tho' oft debas'd with Scenes profane and loose  No Reason weighs against it's proper Use  Tho' the lewd Priest his sacred Function shame  Religion's perfect Law is still the same  Shall they who trace the Passions from their rise  Shew Scorn her Features her own Image Vice  Who teach the Mind it's proper Force to scan  And hold the faithful Mirrour up to Man  Shall their Profession e'er provoke Disdain  Who stand the formost in the moral Train  Who lend Reflexion all the Grace of Art  And strike the Precept home upon the Heart  YET hapless Artist tho' thy Skill can raise  The bursting Peal of universal Praise  Tho' at thy Beck Applause delighted stands  And lifts  Briareus  ' like her hundred Hands  Know Fame awards Thee but a partial Breath  Not all thy Talents brave the Stroke of Death  Poets to Ages yet unborn appeal  And latest Times th' eternal Nature feel  Tho' blended here the Praise of Bard and Play'r  While more than Half becomes the Actor's Share  Relentless Death untwists the mingled Fame  And sinks the Player in the Poet's Name  THE pliant Muscles of the various Face  The Mein that gave each Sentence Strength and Grace  The tuneful Voice the Eye that spoke the Mind  Are gone nor leave a single Trace behind  FINIS
