Underwing Moth seeds on the willow it is found in that state in June and July The Fly appears in August after having remained in the pupa state about twentyone days  Collectors of English Insects enumerate near twenty species of Phalaena under the trivial distinctions of  yellow underwing copper underwing orange underwing pink underwing  c c Among these the most conspicuous both for beauty and magnitude are the  red underwing  and  crimson underwing  The first is by no means uncom∣mon in the winged state The latter is very rare or at least a local species it is found in the larva state on the tops of the highest oaks in Richmond Park and was formerly found in similar situations in Burnt Wood Essex We are not informed that it has been taken in any other part of this kingdom  These two species have been confounded with a third sort that is found in some parts of Europe but does not we have every reason to conclude inhabit this country This is the  Noctua Pacta  of Linnaeus and Fabricius Linnaeus himself in the first editions of the Systema Natura considered the Red Underwing Moth figured by Roesel tab as the Phalaena Pacta and adds it in his Syno∣nyms but it appears corrected in the later editions  Corrected after    After that time Harris in his Aurelian and other works called the  Red Underwing  Phalaena Pacta and the  Crimson Underwing  Pha∣laena Nupta And Dr Berkenhout following Harris or inattentive to the express language of the author he translated has made the same error in his Synopsis of the Natural History of Great Britain  Not corrected in the last edition  Indeed it may be doubted whether any later English work on Insects has detected the error for examining a little tract of Mr Matthew Martin of the Bath Society published in we find the Red Underwing called therein  Phalaena Pacta  To place our remarks in a clear point of view we need only quote the descriptions of Linnaeus"NOCTUA PACTA Cristata alis grisescentibus subundatis posticis rubris fasciis du  b  s nigris  Abdomine supra rubro  " And again in the general description  "Abdomen supra roseum"  Without adverting to the other charac∣teristic marks this proves that the Linnaean species of  Pacta  cannot be the same with that of the authors before quoted because in their species the upper part of the abdomen is hoary inclining to brown and not red  Berkenhout says the abdomen is reddish above but by this he only encreases the mistake for his species agrees in every other respect with the Willow Moth on which plant he also says it is  ound Page Vol  Their Phalaena Pacta can be no other than the Phalaena Nupta of Linnaeus and Fabricius the precise species represented in our plate of which Linnaeus and Fabricius say "Habitat in Europae Sallce Vitellina" and of the Phalaena Pacta and Sponsa "Habitat in Europae Quercu" The first lives on willows the two others on oaks  We close our remarks with observing that the above quoted English authors have been no less mistaken as to Phalaena Nupta which they have made the Crimson Underwing Moth We have before expressed our doubt whether Phalaena Pacta has ever been found in this countrywe add that the Insect known to English collectors by the trivial name of Crimson Underwing is the  Phalaena Sponsa  of Linnaeus and Fabricius  Vide Entomologia Systematica Vol p p  and consequently not connected in the least with Phalaena Nupta  The readers of the works of Harris Berkenhout c are requested to  read  For Phalaena Nupta Phalaena Sponsa Crimson Under∣wing Moth  For Phalaena Pacta Phalaena Nupta Willow Red Under∣wing Moth  And finally remove Phalaena Pacta from the list of British species till it is proved to be a native of this country  PLATE CCXXV SIREX SPECTRUM BLACKBODIED TAILED WASP

cannot but admire the Linnaean definitions for their perspicuity in general we must in some instances blame him for that inattention which has betrayed succeeding naturalists into errors  and even absurdities The force of this remark however harsh it may appear will apply in a particular degree to the specific defini∣tion and quoted Synonyms of Papilio Hyale and consequently to two other similar species involved in the same error  Linnaeus gave the description of Papilio Hyale as above quoted in the Systema Natura from an insect in his own cabinet and quotes in the Synonyms the Butterfly figured by  Roesel Vol    tab    fig  The works of that author being known in every part of Europe the entomologists of that time received the figure as that of the true Hyale and relying on the accuracy of the Lin∣naean references the mistake has been overlooked to the present period Fabricius who is the latest systematic writer on this sci∣ence quotes the figures in Roesel as Linnaeus had himself in the first instance and he also refers to figures of the same insect in the works of Cramer and Schaeffer An error of such specious appear∣ance could only be detected by a reference to the specimen in the Linnaean Cabinet at this time in the possession of Dr Smith and by this it appears that every author has mistaken the species of Lin∣naeus and that Linnaeus was himself mistaken in supposing the insect described was the same as that figured by Roesel and to which he refers that the Linnaean  Papilio Hyale  is what later authors have considered  Papilio Palaeno  and that the true  Papilio Palaeno  is not a British species  These errors are so complicated that we must examine the cha∣racters assigned to each species with the utmost attention and we shall then find his descriptions correct but the synonyms erroneous Papilio Hyale is described with  yellow wings  the colour of the wings in the supposed Hyale is not of that kind which Linnaeus would have called yellow  flavis  but  fulvis  being of a deep orange colour much inclining to red Either of these expressions will certainly admit of great latitude but we must not therefore confound one with the other The two silver spots are not constant though it forms a part of the specific character we have seen in both the clouded yellow and clouded orange butterflies sometimes only one spot though in general it has two On the whole the Linnaean  description of  Papilio Hyale  seems to agree with the fictitious  P Palaeno  of our collections and the specimen in the Linnaean cabinet places it beyond conjecture  Fabricius has not attended to the errors of former authors on this subject even in his last work  Syst Ent  he adds to the specific de∣scription of his P Hyale Mas margine alarum nigro immacu∣lato foemina maculato  The wings in the males have a broad black bar on the exterior margin in the female the bars are spotted  by this it is evident he alludes to the clouded orange for it is not so in the Linnaean insect the broad bar of black being constantly spotted in both sexes We have also observed that the rare variety with white wings is only the female that which is yellow is the male the same is observed also of Papilio Rhamni or Brimstone Butterfly and as the males of all insects are more abundant than the females and the males of P Hyale are rare the variety or sex with white wings must be extremely so These have been taken in a clover field in the month of August in company with the clouded orange  It may be proper to close this description with a few observations on the true Papilio Palaeno as the subject before us has hitherto passed under that name Linnaeus says alis integerrimis flavis apice nigris margineque fulvis posticis subtus puncto argenteo this does not agree with or at least express the Insect generally called Palaeno and the specimen in the Linnaean cabinet proves it to be a different species the P Palaeno has no yellow spots on the black margins of the wings and the spot in the center of the anterior pair is small and shaped like a shuttle its native place is unknown A variety of the pale clouded yellow is found in America and by mistake is sometimes placed in cabinets as a British species  FIG II PAPILIO EDUSA CLOUDED ORANGE BUTTERFLY LEPIDOPTERA PAPILIO  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  AND  SYNONYMS  Wings entire fulvous or orange with a black spot and margin of the same colour On the under side greenish a black spot on the anterior wings silver on the posterior wings  PAPILIO EDUSA alis integerrimis fulvis puncto margineque nigris subtus virescentibus anticis puncto nigro posticis argenteo  Fab Ent Syst    p    If our observations on the preceding species are satisfactory and conclusive the Insect before us must be a distinct species and not the true P Hyale for which it has ever been received This involves another interesting consideration for Linnaeus must have been ac∣quainted with this species as he refers to figures of it in several Authors It is probable he considered it as a variety for it does not appear under another name in any part of his Writings  Fabricus has described a new species of butterfly under the name  Edusa  in his last work  Ent Syst  which seems to agree with our insect and we are confirmed in our opinion by Mr Jones of Chelsea who assisted Fabricius with considerable information and assures us it is certainly the P Edusa of that author  In a former part of this work we have given the male of this insect as P Hyale the annexed figure represents the female having large yellow spots in the black border of the wings Both this and the preceding species are figured by Esper in the  Papiliones de l'Eu∣rope  and by  Schaeffer  in the  Icones Rabisbon  c  PLATE CCXXXIX  FIG I PHALAENA TREPIDA

the skirts of woods its habit is much the same as that of P Atalanta Red Admirable but it is by no means so common  This species has hitherto been deemed the Papilio Camilla of Linnaeus though it differs in a slight degree from the descriptions and figures of authors who describe only German or Swedish speci∣mens of it In the late editions of the  Systema Naturae  P Camilla is described with P Sibilla a Papilio nearly allied to it but which Linnaeus considered as a distinct species his description of  Camilla  expressly saying "angulo ani rubro"The angulis ani of P Si∣billa  Roesel's figure vol tab has an obscure red band entirely across the posterior wingsSchaeffer's figure has no trace of red on that part  not being of a red colour removes it from the English species  Fabricius is of a different opinion and in dissenting from his au∣thority it is incumbent to state our objections In the  Species insec∣torum  of that author the P Camilla with the Linnaean specific cha∣racter is made a variety β of Sibilla The synonyms of the two insects are ambiguous and the references not more satisfactory Among others he refers for P Sibilla  to Drury's Ins    tab    fig    to Roesel Ins    tab    fig    and to Schaeffer    ErratumDesigned for for is the German variety of Papilio Iris Purple Emperor Butterfly    fig  The two last are perhaps the same species the first is un∣questionably different For  P Camilla  he refers to  Roesel tab    fig  and this agrees with our specimen except in the colours of the upper surface being somewhat paler so that we may conclude our English Insect is not only the P Camilla of Linnaeus but also the β Camilla of Fabricius  The ultimate opinion of Fabricius is however different for in the  Entomologia Systematica  since published Camilla and Sibilla stands a dictinct species and Camilla is thus described "alis dentatis atris cocruleo micantibus fascia utrinque maculari alba posticis fubtus basi argentea immaculata"  Linn Syst Nat    habitat in Austria  Thus P Camilla will no longer agree with our insect nor with that figured by  Roesel plate    fig  But if we refer to the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus we discover another error for  instead of the above quoted specific character Linnaeus only says "Alis dentatis fuscis subconcoloribus albo fasciatis maculatisque angulo ani rubro"  p  and this is clearly our insect From this the whole of the Fabrician account is obviously a com∣plicated error of description and synonyms and without attempting to investigate it further we shall speak of both species as they appear to us  We consider the Common English Admirable as the true  P Camilla  and that Sibilla and not Camilla is the Austrian species as we have received it from that country it is  much darker  in the  upper surface  and has a  row  of  shining blue spots  all round the wings the  base  of the  posterior wings  beneath  silvery  and  without spots  as Fabricius describes his Camilla Our insect on the contrary has  no row of blue spots  on the  upper surface  but a  red spot  at the inner angle of the posterior wings the  base  of the  lower wings  are also  silvery beneath  but  has black spots  upon it They differ in many other respects these alone determine them to be two species and ours to be the  Camilla  of Linnaeus  We have inspected the drawings of Mr Jones from which Fa∣bricius describes most of his Papiliones and are confirmed in our opinion  PLATE CCXLV CIMEX FLAVOMARGINATUS  GENERIC CHARACTER  Rostrum inflected Antennae longer than the thorax wings folded crosswise thorax
