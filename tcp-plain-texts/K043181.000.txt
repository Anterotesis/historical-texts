 THE TRAVELLERS IN  SWITZERLAND  A COMIC OPERA IN THREE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE  THEATRE ROYAL  COVENT GARDEN  By Mr BATE DUDLEY  The curious Wanderer left afar to roam  Sighs for that comfort which he left at home  LONDON  Printed for J DEBRETT opposite BurlingtonHouse Piccadilly  DEDICATION  TO  THOMAS HARRIS Esq  PATENTEE c c OF THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  MY DEAR SIR  THE  TRAVELLERS  in their Dramatic Tour through  SWITZERLAND  have derived so considerable a share of their celebrity from your judicious guidanceand their Author owes so much to your zealous friendship on all occasions that it were impossible to inscribe this  OPERA  to any other person than yourself without violating those feelings which have so invariably represented you as the object of his regard and esteem  I am dear Sir Very faithfully yours  H B DUDLEY  Bradwell Lodge  March  ADVERTISEMENT  THE STORY on which the following DRAMA is founded however defective is not borrowedVarious curtailments and transpositions of Scenes have unavoidably deranged the unities of the Piece for the convenience of Stage representation Several of the AIRS and all the CHORUSES having been written to compiled Music the critical reader will make a suitable indulgence for some irregular and uncouth numbers which he will necessarily meet with  The AUTHOR has too high a sense of the zealous exertions of his whole DRAMATIS PERSONAE to make any distinction in that general tribute of thanks which he gratefully pays to their united merit To Mr SHIELD he is indebted on this occasion for every thing that friendship and professional talent could contribute  The Passages omitted on the Stage are marked with inverted Commas  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Mr Sidney  Mr MUNDEN  Dorimond  Mr JOHNSTONE  Dalton  Mr INCLEDON  Count

Daniel leading his mule towards itAfter his calling loudly the Landlord and Landlady appear  SEPTETTOI  Daniel  HOUSE Landlord Landlady I say  Landlord  Qui va la  Landlady  My Lor Anglois  Daniel  So I am and yet you'll find  Greater folks than me behind  Enter Lady  PHILIPPA  Mr  SIDNEY  Sir  LEINSTER JULIA  and  DORIMOND  disguised as  Cazelle  a Swiss Valet  Landlord and Landlady  Je suis charm√©  Lady Phillippa  You alarm me  No good company to meet  Mr Sidney and Sir Leinster  Nothing in the house to eat  Landlady  Jean  All  Landlord Tapster Drawer Waiter  Sir Leinster  Oh leave the matter to myself  Best an Irishman can cater  Where there's nothing on the shelf  Mr Sidney  Is there nothing on the shelf  Mr Sidney and Sir Leinster  Bring at least a slice of ham in  Daniel  'Tis in vain to think of cramming  All  Nothing in the house to eat  This is misery complete  DUO  CAZELLE and JULIA  Such distresses never move  Minds that purely live on love  Sir Lein  Having nothing to eat I perceive is one of the luxuries we get by travelling into foreign parts  Lady Phil  Take care of the baggage  Cazelle  and see that the trunk with my family arms upon it is particularly secured  Cazelle  Oui Madame  Mr Sidney  The honest fellow  clapping Dorimond on the shoulder  that so gallantly preserved your daughter's life at the hazard of his own will not be found deficient in the common offices of fidelity depend on't  Exeunt within the Auberge  SCENE II  Enter Lady  PHILIPPA  and  DANIEL  Lady Phil  What news have you picked up Daniel are there any people of rank or old families beside myself on the road  Daniel  Not that I know of my Lady I've only heard of two surprizing things one is that young 'Squire Dalton passed this way a few weeks ago on his travels  Lady Phil  That is strange indeed  Daniel  But the other is much more wonderful  Lady Phil  What can that be  Daniel  Why my Lady a fine bewitched Castle only two leagues off now that in my notion is a sight worth going all the world over to see  Lady Phil  Poh this nonsense of witches and enchanted castles will one day or other turn your brain Daniel  Daniel  Oh what a noble sight an enchanted castle must be  Exit Daniel  Lady Phil  Such a pair of ridiculous lovers as Dalton and Miss Somerville romance itself has never recordedboth quarrelling with each other on a punctilio of false pride when neither of their families have so much as a pedigre to be proud ofthough I think we heard enough of her antient Chateau which she went abroad to take possession of  Enter Mr  SIDNEY  Mr Sidney  Julia and Sir Leinster seem inclined to breakfast on a prospect they have discovered a distant country through the telescope which she contends is the cliffs of Dover while Sir Leinster to be a match for her in geography declares it to be the Mangerton mountains near the lake of Killarney  Lady Phil  Now I must conjure you Mr Sidney to lay aside your coarse jokes and to deport yourself for the remainder of the tour as may become the dignity of my family in a foreign clime  Mr Sidney  You know my Lady Philippa that the ruling object of my life is to make you happy  Lady Phil  For shame Mr Sidney pray let me ask in what single instance have you shewn it name one  Mr Sidney  Compose yourself my dear and I willDid I not forbid our neighbour young Dorimond my house because the poor fellow could not prove his descent from one of the twelve Caesars  Lady Phil  Don't name the upstart in my presencea creature without a coat of arms to his family  Mr Sidney  But having honour and private worth I should have given him up with reluctance tho' he had been without a coat to his back  Lady Phil  I think Mr Sidney you might pay a little more respect to the memory of my ancestors  Mr Sidney  Come come my Lady Philippa  et us drop this subject or you'll worry yourself  about the antiquity of your ancestors till you grow as old as the best of 'em  Lady Phil  Very well Sirvastly well  Mr Sidney  Have I ever uttered a single emonstrance on our carriage being overloaded with your quarterings and scutcheons like a country hearse  Lady Phil  I see through your cruel design Siryou intend to break my heart in a foreign country  Mr Sidney  And did not I take the advertisement for your Swiss valet to the newspaper with my own hands and procure you one to attend upon my person with whiskers as long as a pole cat  Lady Phil  Go on Sir go on dishonour me through life and when I am no more persevere in your barbarity and let no family trophies follow me to my tomb  Mr Sidney  Oh my dear Lady Philippa  AIR IIMr SIDNEY  WHEN convinc'd by the deep sounding  boum  That in earnest you seek your long home  For trifles I then will not cavil  But resign'd to my fate  I'll direct that in state  On this journey you proudly may travel  With a bim boum bell  At your death since you wish it my dear  All your honors of birth may appear  For Heralds your arms shall reveal O  Hang your a'chment up high  To tell all who pass by  That my duck has got  quies in Caelo  With a bim boum bell  Lady Phil  Oh you monster of a man you would bury me alive get me a glass of Eau de Cologne or I shall faint  sits down  Enter  DANIEL  Daniel  Here's a letter I fancy for your Ladyship with a coat of arms on it as big as a waterman's badge  Lady Phil  Rising in extacy and receives it  Coat of arms  Sidney  So then go which way I will I am crossed at every turn by some new fangled notions of false grandeur  aside  Lady Phil  Looking minutely at the seal  Field sable three panthers passant gorged with ducal collars chained armed crested tufted and hoofed  Mr Sidney  And horned too I suppose to compleat the impression of modern heraldry  Lady Phil  From some illustrious personage my life on't  Daniel  Yes my Lady I'm sure by what his servant says he's a foreign Lord at the least  Lady Phil  And yet its rather singular that he should not know my name  reads  "A MesdamesMesdames Angloises"  opens it  yes he must be a man of fashion for he writes I perceive in all the languages  reads indistinctly  "Comte Friponiles belles Angloiseshis devoirs in personand chaperon them through Geneva and its environs"  Delightful Friponi That's surely a very old name  Mr Sidney  Yes my Lady one of the antient families no doubt which the deluge had not time  to sweep away This must be the fellow that I saw in close conference with our Swiss  aside  Lady Phil  Notwithstanding your sneers Mr Sydney I shall not you perceive be entirely deserted in your absence if you should pursue your commercial scheme to Strasburgwho's there does the Courier wait  Enter  DORIMOND  as Swiss Valet  Cazelle  Yes my Lady  Lady Phil  Give me the port feiulle that I may write an answer immediately  Exit with Swiss  Mr Sidney  Travel so far from correcting seems but to increase her romantic malady This artificial weakness bears down all the amiable qualities of her nature and the infatuation if not checked will descend I fear even to the unaffected Julia serious remonstrance has been of no avail the force of ridicule is my last resource and the object is too valuable to leave the most painful experiment untried for its recovery  Enter  SIR LEINSTER M'LOGHLIN  Sir Lein  What the devil Mr Sidney have you done to my Lady Philippa this morning yesterday she graciously told me she could find no blot in my 'scutcheonnow this minute she whisked as spitefully by me as a bullet from a cross bow  Come come stand my friend with Miss Julia and tell her once for all how clever a husband I'll make her  Mr Sidney  Look ye Sir Leinster as old friends dont let you and I talk seriously when we can  avoid it  Julia has declared never to favour the addresses of any one without my approbation in no case therefore but that of extreme necessity shall a father's authority controul her inclination  The future happiness of her life will probably depend on her own choicelet the man of her heart then win her and wear her say I  Sir Lein  My dear fellow give me your hand and is that what you say Win her and wear her Oh say no more only leave me alone for that  AIR III Sir LEINSTER M'LOGHLIN  TO win and to wear a sweet creature  Is always Sir Leinster's delight  The first thing he dreams in the morning  The last that awakes him at night  He's tight when he slips from his pillow  As a ship that is just out of dock  Tho' at dusk with a skinful of Claret  He's apt to run foul of a rock  Sing  smaghler oo smack smhilat smothar  How funny this taste is of mine  Oh I learnt it from father and mother  To love pretty women and wine  Enter  LADY PHILIPPA  Lady Phil  Well Mr Sidney we can part with you now as soon as you please for Count Friponi in his note has recommended to me an English guide who lives just at the foot of the mountaintho' he knows but little of the man himself he is reckoned the cleverest creature in the world who can tell us every body and every thing  Mr Sidney  An English guide recommended to you by a foreign Countthere must be some mischief on foot  aside  Lady Phil  Yes and dont you think this an act of great courtesy and condescension in a man of high family  Mr Sidney  Without doubt my everlasting love  ruminating  If such a device were practicable  aside  Lady Phil  What are you prosing about  Mr Sidney  I'm thinking my Lady Philippa that in my absence is it not possible that you may thus subject yourself to some imposition  Lady Phil  Imposition I know you deem me a weak creature shew me the man Mr Sidney that can impose upon me  Mr Sidney  Its worth the experiment at all events  aside  But dont you perceive that this will be an unnecessary increase of your expences  Lady Phil  Poh what signifies expence when the honour of a family is concerned the larger the suite you know the more dignified besides he'll be a better interpreter than Cazelle the Swiss who is far too reserved  Mr Sidney  I should be sorry to withhold my consent even in  Lady Phil  Your consent now Mr Sidney you have made it an object of too much importance for me to dispense withso have him I will and there's an end of it  Mr Sidney  Then all I have to do is I suppose as usual to acquiesce  Lady Phil  To be sure  Exit  Mr Sidney  Well said my Lady Philippa  musing  There can be no great difficulty in defeating  the probable rascalities of the Count who from what I can learn of our landlord is little better than a desperado after allThis same Guide intended no doubt for some secret service of that fashionable impostor may with a little dexterity be managed so as to answer a better purpose of mine  I shall satisfy myself at least whether the regard she pays to other opinions in preference to mine be a turn towards natural depravity or merely the coquettish folly of family pride If only the affection of vice she may yet be shamed out of itshould it prove worse the painful alternative my own honour must suggest  Who knows but I may be received as her guide by stratagem tho' refused it thro' life on the score of long tried affection  I remember to have enacted Davus before the grave dons of Westminster with tolerable success  How shall I manage my voice but there can be no great difficulty in that for Lady Philippa has paid too little regard to its natural key to be struck with it under any disguise it may now assume  Exit  SCENE IIICastle Gardens  Enter  Miss SOMERVILLE  AIR IV  EVER let me shun the danger  Absence is ordain'd to prove  Where the mind to pride a stranger  Blends Indifference with love  Oh ye hoary mountains say  That surround me night and day  How elate have I 'ere now  Sought with hope your proudest brow  Aloft in air  Thensad reverse of scene  How soon alas have been  Low at your feet with pale despair  Enter  NERINDA  Ner  Dear ma'am why should we despair I hope we are not doomed to live alone for ever  Miss Somerville musing  I wonder who that could be I saw just now through the glass from the turret perhaps he's near enough by this time to be observed with the naked eye  Exit unperceived by Miss Somerville  Miss Som  This completes the first year of my selfbanishment from an object which I find is still dearer to me even than my country How devoted is that affection which neither time can alter nor distance remove In vain have I endeavoured to reproach my own heart for permitting me to fly from all it values Oh Dalton if I still beheld thee at the feet of another my pride would take the same alarm and again inform thee that I must dispense with those addresses which I owed more to my fortune than my person Had I wronged him by a groundless suspicion he could not have withdrawn himself with that cold respect without attempting the smallest explanation of his conduct Though my mind approves the sacrifice it has made it cannot recollect it with indifference  perusing a letter she had written  That enquiry after  Dalton will betray a womanly weakness to others and a want of resolution to myselfIt must not be  draws her pen through a passage folds up and addresses the letter  Yet how vain to erase him here when he is imprinted on my heart for ever  Enter  NERINDA  hastily  DUETT V  Ner  DEAR ma'am I've such a sight for you  One fit for any queen  Oh run the sweetest man to view  Your eyes have ever seen  Miss Som  Oh fie no no no no  Ner  Now I pray don't say no no no no  Ner  Along the lake I saw him stray  Where tempests oft begin  Poor soul he may have lost his way  Oh let us ask him in  Miss Som  Oh fie no no no no  Ner  Now I pray don't say no no no no  Ner  Why not he seems a countryman of our own and may tell us all the news of dear England  Miss Som  Prythee Nerinda do not trifle with meI have addressed a pacquet to my agentyou must see it safely delivered to the mulateer when he next passes the mountains  Ner  He looked a charming man from the turret and as I happen to have the key of the abbey gate I'll take a nearer peep at him presently if I die for't Heigho  sighs  Miss Som  Heyday Nerinda why that deep sigh  Ner  In pity ma'am that two such creatures as you and I should be so unhandsomely concealed from the world  Miss Som  Oh I know the world a little better than you and believe me that unprotected woman is never so happy as in seclusion  Ner  Well now I don't think that ever I should have found that out  Miss Som  Bred a recluse Nerinda don't you prefer the peaceful freedom of this mansion to the dull austerities of a convent  Ner  Oh dear ma'am the nunnery was certainly the most sprightly thing of the two for there one had the privilege of peeping at a man through the grate on a redletter day but as to this dreary castle of your great grandfather's nothing human will approach it the shepherds run away from us for fear of being bewitched and the last time Margery went to market they were about to swim her poor soul for a wizard  Miss Som  Come a truce to raillery  You know that I have imposed upon myself this penance and the prejudices of the world shall not move me from my resolve  If you Nerinda feel it a restraint any longer to remain with me I will gladly endeavour to provide you a situation more suitable to the natural gaiety of your temper  Ner  O dear ma'am indeed I did but jokeI would not quit you for the whole worldI was more anxious to shorten your serious moments I assure you than my own  Miss Som  Amiable girl  Ner  However ma'am its necessary that something should be done with the other part of your household for I left it in a state little short of mutiny but here comes a pair of them to speak for themselves  Enter  ROBIN  and  MARGERY  Miss Som  Well pray what are your complaints  Robin  Not for want of good living my Lady for no one roasts or boils every day better than our Margery  Margery  Nor for more wagesfor and please your Ladyship I am sure we are as well paid as fed  Miss Som  What is it then you want  Robin  Why if I may be zo bold as to speak my mind Madge and I here have laid our heads together for sometime in this dismal country and begin to think we should like to taste what true liberty is in our own  Miss Som  And is this really the case Margery  Margery  And please you my Lady Robin has promised to make me his lawful spouse as soon as we set foot in old England again  Miss Som  Poor creature and that's the way she would secure her liberty  Ner  Well but Margery can't you contrive to be married here  Robin  Yes ma'am in a botching kind of a waybut if the knot was to come azunder and let her down in her old days I should never forgive myself  AIR VII QUARTETTO MARGERY ROBIN NERINDA  and  Miss SOMERVILLE  Marg  THUS on my bended knees I pray  All  Ah welladay  Robin  Madge is in a melting mood  Marg  Let him cheer my latter days  Robin  Hear her ma'am she never prays  But for zomething very good  Nerinda  Now for some most doleful ditty  Marg  He's the only man I prize  Miss Som  How the creature moves my pity  Robin  Drown me not those sloeblack eyes  Miss Som and Nerinda  Cease your sorrow and arise  Robin  Stop your flood gates wipe your eyes  Miss Som  As your affections seem mutual at the end of three months your further services shall be dispensed with and a passport procured for your conveyance to England  Margery  Heaven bless you and send your Ladyship a good husband in your turn and that speedily  Ner  How happy you have made 'em  Robin  Drop another curtsy do'e Madge and now live in hopes a little longer like a reasonable woman  Exeunt  SCENE IV  LADY PHILIPPA  and  JULIA  Lady Phil  Heaven be praised your father has taken his departure for Strasburgh  Julia  You must excuse me my Lady if I cannot rejoice at the loss of his society  Lady Phil  No great loss child for now I can see good company without the fear of being checked by the coarseness of his English jokes  Let me expect Julia that before the men you are properly reserved and if you see me condescend occasionally to be a little more gracious to them you should consider who I am and that you child in the line of precedence are only the daughter of Mr Sidney  Julia  A distinction my Lady sufficiently honourable in my mind I can assure you  Lady Phil  In a word no more love fits  You must know I expect an immediate visit from a Count Friponi who is said to be rather a polished creature  Julia  Probably he may  Lady Phil  With a something so easy in his address and familiar at first sight that I thought it necessary to put you on your guardbesides should you think to find a wealthy admirer on the Continent which was probably your father's object in coming abroad you'll both be much disappointed believe me  AIR VIII  JULIA  JOY sparkles in the roving eye  That seeks for treasure o'er the deep  No billow then can beat too high  No restless gale too boldly sweep  But what lorn maid alas will boast  The spreading sail or willing wind  That wafts her from her native coast  To leave her fondest hope behind  Enter  DANIEL  Daniel  The mules are put to the carriages my Lady and it's only four leagues to Genevaoh I'd like to have forgot here's an odd kind of man with only one eye who says he came by your Ladyship's order  Lady Phil  By my order oh then it must be the English guide that the Count recommendedshew him in he is just in time to go along with us  Exit Daniel  Enter Mr  SIDNEY  disguised as  LOPEZ    You are the person recommended to be our guide  Lopez  Speaking quick throughout his scenes in disguise  The same at your Ladyship's eternal command now I'm launched my fears begin to vanish  aside  Lady Phil  How had you the misfortune to lose an eye  Lopez  Merely by intense study illustrious Lady  Lady Phil  What might that study be  Lopez  The Heraldry of antient Greece  Lady Phil  How fortunate to meet with so illumined a creature why you must have seen better days  Lopez  I have indeed my Lady and am lineally descended from the first race of Picts who made you know no small figure in the world before cloaths came into fashion  Enter  DANIEL  who stares at Mr Sidney  Lady Phil  Take care of this person Daniel he's a clever creature and has known better days  Daniel  Take care of my little stock of linen  aside  Lady Phil  Now I look at him again I can plainly perceive the man of consequence in him  aside  What is your name  Lopez  Lopez is my travelling name my Lady  Lady Phil  Well then Lopez you may now recite the curiosities that are most worthy our seeing  Lopez  It's well I picked up a slice or two of the marvellous along with my new jacket  aside  First of all most noble Lady you have no doubt paid a visit to the immense Glacieres  Lady Phil  No we have not  Lopez  No why one of them wears his snowy nightcap two thousand toises above the common clouds  Daniel  Phew  whistles  Lady Phil  That must be nobly tremendous  Lopez  On our right about a league and a half standsthe enchanted castle of the mountains  Daniel  impatiently  Aye that's the very same castle my Lady I told you of and a sight worth travelling to see indeed Oh he's a much cleverer fellow than I took him for  aside  Lady Phil  Who is the possessor  Lopez  pausing  A lucky thoughtI'll give it to the Comte'Tis one of the antient possessions of the Comte Friponi  Lady Phil  Indeed  Lopez  Yes my LadyBut I must request you to be on your guard as he is unwilling to acknowledge this part of his domain from  the awful family circumstance which led to his present celebrity  Lady Phil  What family circumstance proceed  Daniel  anxiously  Ay pray Sir do tell us all about it  Lopex  About a century and a half ago a Knight of Charlemagne one of the Comte's illustrious progenitors was slain there within the antient Hall of Arms in a tilting match gallantly defending the honour of his fair mistress Immediately on hearing this she threw herself headlong from the lofty battlements and falling upon the foot of the Drawbridge heroicly dashed her lovely self to atoms  Dan  Poor soul  Lady Phil  She acted indeed like an antient woman of honour  Lopez  At four periods in the year about twilight she has since been seen to pass through the illumined Hall sometimes in white at others in blue and fire  Daniel  Bless meblue and fire  Lady Phil  But who inhabits it now  Lopez  Two ladies who had quarrelled with the world are said to have got there but for what purpose is not known  Lady Phil  I am all impatience to behold the Hall of Arms  Lopez  I can shew your Ladyship that and the castle throughout without the Comte's delicacy being hurt by the knowledge of it  Daniel  Oh it will be well worth your seeing my LadySuppose I was to go forward myself and enquire a little about it first  Lady Phil  I don't think that would be amiss Daniel and bring me some further account of it to Geneva But be careful for curiosity you know has always been your particular failing so take care Daniel that it does not run you into too much danger  Exi  Daniel  Oh never fear me my Lady for spirits and wizzards you know were always my delight from a child What a comical world it is that we odd folks live in nothing delights my curiosity so much as a touch of the marvellous now and then it fancies a bit of the doleful tho' a little simple mirth after all it finds the easiest of digestion  AIR IX  JOY and grief are too many for poor little Dan  In his mind they kick up such a pother  So the one I serve truly as well as I can  And by some friendly proxy do suit to the other  For light is my heart and merry  With a high up not with your low down derry  See these eyelids were made for no snivelling Elf  But light feather'd to twinkle with glee  When I'm merry I manage to laugh with myself  And when sad why this flask kindly weeps for poor me  For light is my heart and merry  With a high up not with your low down derry  SCENE V An extensive Lake A Fisherman's Hut in a Rock c  DALTON  coming out of the Hut  Dalton  Let me turn from the distressing scenes of memory to those of nature so beautifully ranged around mehow unruffled is this expanse of water  AIR X  ELEMENT of liquid beauty  Mirror chaste as op'ning day  How enchanting is your duty  Graceful nature to display  Like the face of that fair creature  Born for man's supreme delight  Thou art deck'd with every feature  That can captivate the sight  How contradictory are all the accounts I can collect my retreat in this trusty creature's hut will at least enable me to avoid the Sidney family who would only trifle with my distress And yet I would gladly learn the better fate of Dorimond and his Julia in whose cause I have so severely sufferedThough I have at length found out the solitary abode of my crue fugitive how can I approach it while her last words weigh so heavily on my heart  Her wealth the object of my address while the person of another engaged my affection 'twas a charge which my pride can never condescend to refutehad she been inferior to me in fortune  a single prejudice of her mind against me my whole life should have been devoted to remove  But here comes my honest fisherman whose busy scenes afford me some amusement  Enter FishermanDalton shakes hands with him  AIR XIGLEE  OH say ye happy mountaineers who lead a life secure  How little do you reckon on the hardships we endure  While on the lake poor fishermen for bread are doom'd to go  Dark or light  Day or night  Where tempestuous winds do blow  And the billows break below  Our element's the water on which we work amain  The stars our only pilots to steer us home again  But on the beach relanded we feel our spirits flow  And on shore  Heed no more  How tempestuous winds do blow  Or the billows break below  Fisherman  Come lads bustle bustle and I'll be with you by the time you've shot the biggest trowl in the bay  Exeunt Fishermen  Enter  NERINDA  peeping  Dalton  Torment us how she maywoman dear woman must still be the solace of our lives  Ner  As the only lady in company that compliment must belong to me  aside Dalton turns  and sees her  I fear Sir as a stranger you flatter me  Dalton  I must first learn how to do justice to so charming a creature but say my pretty one who are you and how came so lovely an English woman in these rude mountains  Ner  Well how delightful it is to hear our native tongue now and then so charmingly spoken  Dalton  Where do you inhabit  Ner  Hard by I saw you from our battlements straying as I thought in a melancholy mood so I ran to ask you if you stood in need of any thing  Dalton  Charitable soul she certainly belongs to the castle  aside  Ner  Pray Sir inform mehow left you our native country  Dalton  Bearing herself still proudly as becomes the first of nations and solicitous like you to succour those around her in distress but you'll allow me to attend you backI've a thousand things to say to you  Ner  Oh no that can't bewe keep a very strict house I assure you And yet he seems a good creature that might assist me in comforting my poor lady  aside  Do you see that dismal mansion  pointing  Dalton  Not long since I passed near it  Ner  Then if you must know two spinsters of us inhabit it  Dalton  Indeed the companion no doubt of my Louisa  aside  Ner  One facinated by the spells of her own mind from which I would fain relieve herand  the other escaped from a conventand as you see not exactly calculated for such solitary confinement  Dalton  But your companionis she an Englishwoman and as charming as yourself  Ner  Every way my superior I assure youbut you must not be too particular at presenta thought has just struck me that you might perhaps assist me in rallying her out of this self captivity  Dalton  By all means command me this instant  Ner  Oh no not quite so violently for I can only gain you admittance by an innocent stratagembut indeed how dare I confide in a stranger  Dalton  Why should you doubt me  Ner  That's true for you are an Englishman and the service I require of you is the kind relief of a woman  Dalton  Then let me fly with you this moment  Ner  I tell you that's impossible but should I happen to see you a little before sunset where the view opens from the castle to the Glacieres there if my courage fail me not I may perhaps haps give you further instructions till then adieu  Dalton  I'll certainly attend youBut surely you will not leave me thus uninformed to return to solitude  AIR XII  NERINDA  SINCE you ask me I'll honestly tell you the truth  Flesh and blood cannot bear such restraint in their youth  I should like this same solitude better I own  Was it not that I hate to be sighing alone  For then poor  Heigho  is but labour in vain  Because one can't get a  Heigho  back again  Two rivers when blended we very well know  At all times more sweetly in unison flow  Then my word for't you'll find that there's nothing amiss  If two hearts should thus form but one current of bliss  For then poor  Heigho  is not labour in vain  Because one may get a  Heigho  back again  SCENE VI  An Hotel at Geneva  JULIA  and  CAZELLE  entering to her  Caz  The Comte come with my lady and she ask Mademoiselle for youI beg pardonbut I hope you not forget that de foreign Comtes are never the most honourable lover  Julia  You are determined I find Cazelle to make me every hour more your debtor  Caz  Oh Miss you honour too great my humble fidelit√©  retiring  Julia  Come hither CazelleI owe you much more than this small tribute of gratitude for my preservation  offering a purse  Caz  Oh no Miss  laying his hand on his breast  I have been pay for it here over and over again  Julia  Noble minded creature  Cazelle  My transport had nearly betrayed me  aside  Exit  Julia  There is something in the mild manners of this faithful Cazelle which indicates that fortune has been unmindful of his desertshis kind attention to my safety brings to my mind the painful recollection of the friend if nothing more I lost in Dorimond  AIR XIII  Oh love declare dear friendship say  Why why shou'd memory impart  A bliss or sorrow pass'd away  To cheat alas the silly heart  On plighted vowson transports dwell  Such memory alone impart  From thy record these fondly tell  And kindly cheat the silly heart  Enter  COMTE  leading in  LADY PHILIPPA  Comte  Ah ma chere Dame comme vous aime  Sings  ad lib  and kneels  Lady Phil  Rise Comte

Win her and wear her  oh to be sure and I won't do that  Caz  What can all this mean  Lopez  Some new family mischief on foot my life on't  Sir Lein  Come as neither of you can write I'll read this to

punctual delivery of it that you are equally faithful and we shall soon come to a better understanding my life on't  Exit  Caz  Were it not for that purse of money I shou'd think it possible that this fellow might still be honestbut I begin to suspect every thing around meHitherto I have avoided discovery To be banished the family as a friend and recalled into it as a domestic are transitions which fortune in the height of her caprice does not often display Yet the service is still hazardous for with my dialect I must continue to disguise those feelings also which the presence of her I love so naturally inspiresPoor Dalton harder still is his fate to loose his own mistress in the kind endeavour to secure mine When in compassion to my natural diffidence he was prevailed upon to convey my sentiments of affection to JULIA I little thought it could afford to Miss Somerville the slightest ground for jealousy or suspicion Had I seen her before so abrupt a departure to shut herself in a family castle on the Continent I might have convinced her at least that Dalton's interviews with my Julia were merely to promote the addresses of his friend  AIR XIX CAZELL  His vows to Julia lovely

when you do that you'll remember if you please to forget mine  Lady P  First accept my open recantation for here do I renounce the vain parade and follies of false grandeur convinced that the just
