 A SERMON PREACHED AT CHART SUTTON  KENT  The THIRD of NOVEMBER At the opening of the new Church  The late Church being destroyed by Lightning    BY HENRY JONES A M VICAR of that PARISH and MINOR CANON of ROCHESTER  To which are annexed a List of the Subscribers AND An Account of the Money received by the Brief towards rebuilding the said Church  PRINTED for the AUTHOR  SOLD by WEBSTER GILLMAN CHATHAM  SIMMONS and KIRKBY CANTERBURY AND BY THOMAS EVANS PATER NOSTER ROW LONDON  PREFACE  THIS Discourse when drawn up was not intended for publication the Author never flattering himself with the most distant idea that any thing he could write was deserving of the public notice His compliance with the wishes of some worthy friends in the Parish to publish it was that it might serve as an instrument for conveying the names of those worthy benefactors who have contributed so liberally and cheafully towards rebuilding the church and at the same time to obviate the objections generally made to briefs by a view of the netproduce of so large a sum received by this  Besides expressing by this public information the sense of gratitude the Parish is under to such eminent friends the Author is also inclinable to hope that the prospect of such uncommon generosity may be an inducement to others on such occasions "to go and do likewise" and may afford some encouragement and direction to sufferers labouring under similar calamities  This Discourse published with these motives will serve likewise as a small testimony of the regard the Author entertains for his parishioners whom he begs to accept of his warmest wishes for their temporal and spiritual welfare and to admit his situation as an apology for not visiting them oftner subject as he is to those prior and stronger obligations he feels himself under to the kind  Dean and Chapter of Rochester  friends who conferred on him the living whose favors it shall ever be his study and pleasure to acknowledge with the sincerest gratitude  The late church was destroyed by lightning the d of April  Vid London Magazine for June  The present church was rebuilt by contract on a plan and estimate drawn up by Mr Henry Holland junior architect and is supposed to be the neatest and most commodious church of its size in the diocese  PSALM cxxii Verse  I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the House of the Lord  IT is generally agreed that this Psalm to which these words are an introduction was composed for the use of the People of Israel at their three public and solemn festivals namely of Passover Pentecost and Tabernacles when they were strictly obliged by their law to come from all parts of Judea and to appear before the Lord at Jerusalem At which times they were particularly commanded to offer together with their sacrifices their united tribute of praise and adoration to God in his temple built and set apart for his more immediate service  WE can hardly entertain any idea of religion without the appropriation of particular places for the more solemn exercises of it where societies of men assemble together to present "with one heart and one voice" their joint sacrifice of homage reverence and affectionate acknowledgments to one common parent which naturally at the same time serve to unite such bodies of men already allied to one another by the same nature in the close and intimate ties of religion and benevolence  AMONG the Jews as their religion was taught them from Heaven so we observe a particular place of worship was built by God's express command and direction at Jerusalem where all their tribes were indispensibly bound to attend at some peculiar seasons and solemnities such as those I have before mentioned and other subordinate places were erected in the country nearer and more convenient for their frequent attendance  at other times And in time to such lengths did the Jews carry their veneration for such religious houses that the respect which was at first enjoined to be shewn them by the Supreme Being for the best and wisest purposes as we are most sure all his commandments are degenerated at last into the grossest superstition They thought that the attention which they paid to the House of God dispensed with all other obligations however natural and sacred and that no impiety was so great as the profanation or even the disrespectful mention of their Temple at Jerusalem  THIS was carrying things too far Yet that such places should "be had in honour" we may gather from numberless passages in Holy Scripture and particularly from our Saviour's behaviour to the buyers and sellers in the Temple where tho' at all other times he was most eminent for the gentleness and meekness of his deportment yet on this occasion he is observed  to have shewn the greatest resentment towards the profaners of that holy place and to have accompanied his divine exertions with this reproof "It is written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves"  Mark  xi And so strict a veneration did he himself pay and insisted that others should pay to it that St Mark observes that he would not suffer that "any man should" even "carry any vessel through the Temple"  AND agreeably to this divine pattern the Apostles and first Disciples of our Lord retained and cherished in their minds great respect and veneration for such religious edifices and particularly for the Temple at Jerusalem where they are said in the Acts of Apostles "to have continued daily with one accord"  Acts  ii even after our Saviour's ascension and the descent of the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and they always chose to repair for religious worship to houses  already dedicated to God's Service of which there were great numbers at that time in Judea and in other neighbouring countries and never omitted if possible to assemble insuch places principally "where prayers were wont to be made"  Acts  xvi But when "persecution arose on account of the word" and the Jews "thought that they did God service" not only "in putting them out of their synagogues" but also "in killing them" it is no wonder that we find them assembling "apart by themselves for fear of the Jews" and that as their religious tenets were become in some measure different they found it necessary that their places of divine worship should be distinct also Notwithstanding this we observe that as soon as they found any rest from these persecutions the primitive Christians conforming to the example of their Divine Master and his Apostles did not indiscriminately use every place which presented itself for religious purposes but that there were particular structures soon set  apart by them where they resorted on all solemn occasions and where they were especially exhorted to "continue stedfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship in breaking of bread and in prayer"  Acts  ii And in proportion as these intervals of rest from the malice of their enemies increased their attention to the erection of such sacred edifices is observed to have increased also Wherever Christianity was propagated Churches were built and the zeal of the early Christians was not more discernible in the purity of their lives and manners than in their generous contributions towards such undertakings  BUT here we are obliged with sorrow to consess that soon after the secure establishment of Christianity an undue and superstitious veneration prevailed for such places and such notions were annexed to them as neither Scripture warranted or the genuine usages of primitive Christianity authorized which Christians  at last carried so far that they like the Jews in the degenerate and declining period of their state thought that every virtue was comprised in an intemperate zeal for the externals of religion in ceremonies and in loud professions of honour for the Church which was at length rendered a refuge for and the means of absolving the most enormous criminalsHerein we cannot sufficiently admire the wisdom and moderation of the Church of England which has steered between the two dangerous extremes of superstition on the one hand and a fond spirit of innovation on the other Guided by reason by scripture and the uncorrupted practices of early Christianity she has retained and strongly recommends a high regard for houses erected to the honour of God and has given directions to those whom she has appointed  Overseers over the Church of God  to set apart by prayer and decent ceremonies these venerable Temples And in compliance with the advice of St Paul "that all things should be done decently  and in order"  Cor  xiv among her members she hath taken great care to provide such conveniences for  the assembling together of the People of God  and such helps and assistances to religion and meditation for them when assembled as well by the accommodation of decent religious houses of ceremonies and a composed form of prayer as have procured her service and polity from her warmest advocates the title of "The Beauty of Holiness" and from all sober and wellinformed Christians both at home and abroad the just tribute of honour and respect  THUS have I mentioned such observations as naturally occurred to me at this time and are I hope applicable to the present occasion But still I must desire you to understand that these accommodations however pleasing and venerable in themselves are only instruments conducive indeed to the purposes of religion but which will still prove ineffectual without sincere  sentiments of religion and virtue in the heart in order to make the offering here presented pleasing to God and profitable to ourselves to have it in our power to address each his neighbour in the words of the text with chearfulness and delight "let us go to the house of the Lord" there must be a warm active principle of devotion in our souls "the sacrifice that is holy and acceptable to the Lord is our reasonable service" the service of the mind for the "God" whom we worship "is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth for the Father seeketh such to worship him"  John  iv  INDEED in such situations we have every inducement to excite such dispositions in us We are here assembled in the more immediate presence of Almighty God who has graciously promised that "where two or three are gathered together in his name he will be in the midst of them"  Mathew  xviii We have here a  minister properly prepared and commissioned to inform our understandings and to assist our meditations We have here a number of our fellow christians met together for the same religious purposes we see around us our neighbours friends relations and families such as are allied to us by the tender ties of nature friendship and kindred supplicating the Supreme Author of their existence in the humblest posture of adoration for mercies spiritual and temporal acknowledging the unspeakable obligations they are under to him for their creation preservation and numberless instances of his loving kindness to them and particularly for that amazing demonstration of his compassion to mankind in the redemption of the world by his son Jesus Christ Whereby truths of the utmost importance for us to know are communicated to us every good christian has his reasonable doubts cleared up the terms of his salvation ascertained and at length what the wisest of the heathen world sought before in vain and of which  the Jews had but imperfect notions "life and immortality are brought to" clear "light" by the gospel I say these and such like sentiments must naturally arise in minds beforehand prepared for such holy exercises but at the same time we may be well assured that they are dispositions which cannot be expected from minds corrupted and enslaved by vice and strangers to the love of virtue and religion To such God in his word saith "what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth Who hath required this at thine hand to tread my courts seeing thou hatest instruction and hast cast my words behind thee"  Psalm  It is the pious and virtuous breast only that can declare "Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honour dwelleth"  Psalm  xxvi and can with truth say "I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord"  IT is recorded in the book of Ezra that certain old men who had been eyewitnesses of the grandeur of Solomon's Temple which was destroyed by the Chaldeans after their return from captivity when they silently observed how widely inferior their new Temple was to their former one could not refrain from tears at the camparison  Ezra  xi We have no occasion I believe to be uneasy by any such reflections yea rather we have abundant reason to be thankful that we are enabled so soon after our late calamity joyfully to meet again in our own sanctuary which if not superior to our former one yet has every conveniency and even ornament which can be required in a house set apart for religious purposes Without excuse must we also be if on the present occasion we do not feel warm sentiments of gratitude towards those friends who so generously pitied our distress relieved our necessities and so "far loved" us as to have had so large share in "building us a Synagogue"  But still most inexcusable shall we be if we do not improve these advantages to the noblest purposes of religion and make them the means of improvement to ourselves and others If we do not embrace every opportunity of attending on divine worship in God's House compel those who are more immediately under our care to attend there likewise and to exhibit a deportment suitable to the solemnity of the place And not only while there but we must in all places and in the general course of our lives shew an example of sobriety decency moderation industry justice humanity and piety which will be the most effectual way to enforce our admonitions and to make those around us most strongly attached to virtue  In order to lay a sure foundation for such a behaviour in the rising generation the want of which is every where most sorely lamented you must in a particular manner be careful to habituate your children  betimes to virtuous and religious ways "to reverence God's sanctuary and to train them up in the way that they should go that when they are old they may not depart from it" which will be the most effectual means of making them a comfort to yourselves and worthy members of society and beyond all doubt will be a more certain method of success and happiness to them than if you had it in your power to bestow on them fortunes supposing you have left them destitute of those other most essential qualifications The day which God intended should be more particularly devoted to such purposes is the sabbath day emphatically called by the Apostle the Lord's day Some part of which at least ought not only to be employed in a regular attendance on public worship but also in the instruction of your families at home according to your respective abilities and opportunities This is a duty one would imagine that required no great persuasion to put in practice Our children are in a manner ourselves  The attainment also of knowledge is most pleasing to the mind To impart therefore  It must give great pleasure to every humane christian to find a charityschool set on foot in the parish of CHART for the instruction of poor children in reading which is the key of all knowledge and the practice of such manual arts as may be subservient to their future support in life This has hitherto been maintained by the application of a small portion of the poor's cess and by private contributions but particularly by the generous patronage and support of a lady Mrs Be whose hand and heart are ever open and ready to every good work  religious knowledge to those who are so peculiarly our own and the want of which must cause the greatest distress must needs afford us most sensible satisfaction and we shall receive still greater pleasure from this labour of love when we recollect that by thus employing these sacred seasons of rest from our worldly engagements we are obeying the express commands of God by his Prophet Isaiah who has promised on the performance of these religious offices on his holy day success to our honest undertakings and prosperity to our country "if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy  pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shalt thou delight thyself in the the Lord and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it" Isaiah lviii c  Thus have I my brethren with great plainness of speech but with the greatest sincerity and affection endeavoured to impress you with truths of the greatest importance to your present and future welfare which if suffered to have the desired effects on your minds will "make you wise unto salvation" will render during your journey through a trouble some world the unavoidable strokes of adversity whenever they befal you more tolerable and the smiles of prosperity less dangerous will be a means of bringing down the  blessings of divine providence on yourselves and families and will unavoidably as far as your influence can be supposed to operate contribute your small share to the welfare of your country  I shall conclude my discourse with the admirable exhortation of St Paul to the Philippians "Finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think" meditate "on" and practise "these things"  Phil  iv  A LIST of the SUBSCRIBERS  Towards rebuilding the Parish
