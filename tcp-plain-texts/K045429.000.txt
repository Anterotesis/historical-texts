irregular family  is place was on the whole agreeable to him and  ited to his gay thoughtless temper He found a  entiful table and a good cellar There was in  ed a good deal of work to be done though it  as performed with much disorder and confusion  e family in the main were not unkind to him  ough they often contradicted and crossed him  pecially when things went ill with themselves  is William never much liked for he was al  ys fond of having his own way There was a  erry or rather a noisy and riotous servants' hall  disorder and quarrels are indeed the usual  ects of plenty and unrestrained indulgence The  en were smart but idle the maids were showy but  entious and all did pretty much as they liked  a time but the time was commonly short The  ages were reckoned high but they were seldom  id and it was even said by sober people that the  aster was insolvent and never fulfilled any of his  attering engagements or his most positive pro  ises but still notwithstanding his real poverty  things went on with just the same thoughtlesnes  and splendor and neither masters or servants look+ed beyond the jollity of the present hour  In this unruly family there was little church go+ing and still less praying at home They pretende  indeed in a general way to believe in the Bible bu  it was only an outward profession few of them rea  it at all and even of those who did read it still fewe  were governed by it There was indeed a Bibl  lying on the table in the great hall which wa  kept for the purpose of administering an oath b  was seldom used on any other occasion and som  of the heads of the family were of opinion that th  was its only real use as it might serve to keep th  lower parts of it in order  William who was fond of novelty and pleasur  was apt to be negligent of the duties of the hous  He used to stay out on his errands and one of  favorite amusements was going to the parade to s  the soldiers exercise He saw with envy ho  smartly they were dressed listened with rapture  the music and fancied that a soldier had nothi  to do but to walk to and fro in a certain regul  order to go through a little easy exercise in sho  to live without fighting fatigue or danger  "O" said he whenever he was affronted  home "what a fine thing it must be to be a s  +dier to be so well dressed to have nothing to  but to move to the pleasant sound of sife and dru  and to have so many people come to look at o  and admire one  O it must be a fine thing to b  soldier"  Yet when the vexation of the moment was ov  he found so much ease and diversion in his mast  house so suited to his low taste and sensual ap  +tites  that he thought no more of the matter He forgot the glories of a soldier and eagerly returned to all the mean gratifications of the kitchen His evil habits were but little attended to by those with whom he lived his faults among which were lying and swearing were not often corrected by the family who had little objection to those sins which only of  ended God and did not much affect their own interest  r property And except that William was obliged to work rather more than he liked he found little while  e was young and healthy that was very disagreea  le in this service So he went on still thinking how  ver when things went à little cross "what a  ne thing it was to be a soldier" and at last one  ay as he was waiting at dinner he had the misfor  une to let fall a china dish and broke it all to  ieces It was a curious dish much valued by the  amily as they pretended this family were indeed  pt to set a false fantastic value on things and not  estimate them by their real worth The heads  f the family who had generally been rather pa  ent and goodhumoured with William as I said  efore for these vices which though offensive to  od did not touch their own pocket now flew out  to a violent passion with him called him a thou  nd hard names and even threatened to horse  hip him for his shameful negligence  William in a great fright for he was a sad cow  d at bottom ran directly out of the house to avoid  e threatened punishment and happening just at  at very time to pass by the parade where the  oldiers chanced to be then exercising his resolu  on was taken in a moment He instantly deter  ined to be no more a slave as he called it he  ould return no more to be subject to the humours  of a tyrannical family no he was resolved to b  free or at least if he must serve he would serve n  master but the King  William who had now and then happened to hea  from the accidental talk of the soldiers that tho  who served the  great family  he had lived with we  slaves to their tyranny and vices had also hea  in the same casual manner that the service of th  King  was  perfect freedom  Now he had taken it in  his head to hope that this might be a freedom  do evil or at least to do nothing so he thought  was the only place in the world to suit him  A fine likely young fellow as William was ha  no great difficulty to get enlisted The few for  were soon settled he received the bountymone  as eagerly as it was offered took the oaths of all  +giance and was joined to the regiment and hearti  welcomed by his new comrades He was the ha  +piest fellow alive All was smooth and calm T  day happened to be very fine and therefore Willia  always reckoned upon a fine day The scene w  gay and lively the music cheerful he found t  exercise very easy and he thought there was litt  more expected from him  He soon began to flourish away in his talk an  when he met with any one of his old fellow servan  he fell a prating about marches and countermarche  and blockades and battles and sieges and bloo  and death and triumphs and victories all at ra  +dom for these were words and phrases he h  picked up without at all understanding what  said He had no knowledge and therefore he h  no modesty he had no experience and therefo  he had no fears  All seemed to go on swimmingly for he had  yet no trial He began to think with triumph what  mean life he had escaped from in the old quarrelsome family and what a happy honourable life he should have in the army  O there was no life like  he life of a soldier  In a short time however war broke out his regiment was one of the first which was called out  o actual and hard service As William was the  ost raw of all the recruits he was the first to mur  ur at the difficulties and hardships the cold and  unger the fatigue and danger of being a soldier what watchings and perils and trials and hard  hips and difficulties he now thought attended a military life "Surely" said he "I could never  ave suspected all this misery when I used to see  he men on the parade in our town  He now found when it was too late that all the  elddays he used to attend all the evolutions and  xercises which he had observed the soldiers to go  hrough in the calm times of peace and safety were  nly meant to fit train and qualify them for the  ctual service which they were now sent out to per  orm by the command of the  King  The truth is William often complained when  ere was no real hardship to complain of for  e common troubles of life fell out pretty much  ike to the  great family  which William had left and  the soldiers in the  King's army  But the spirit  f obedience discipline and selfdenial of the latter  emed hardships to one of William's loose turn of  ind When he began to murmur some good old  ldier clapped him on the back saying "cheer  p lad it is a kingdom you are to strive for if we  int not henceforth there is laid up for us a great  eward we have the  King's  word for it man" William  observed that to those who truly believed thi  their labours were as nothing but he himself did not at the bottom believe it and it was observe  of all the soldiers who failed the true cause wa  that they did not really believe the  King's  promis  ▪ He was surprised to see the then soldiers who use  to bluster and boast and deride the assaults of th  enemy now began to fall away while such as ha  faithfully obeyed the  king's  orders and believe  in his word were sustained in the hour of tria  ▪ Those who had trusted in their own strength all fain  ed in the slightest attack while those who had p  on the  armour of the king's  providing  the sword  and  the shield  and  the helmet  and  the breastplat  and whose  feet were shod  according to order no  endured hardships as good soldiers and were e  +abled to fight the good fight  An engagement was expected immediately Th  men were ordered to prepare for battle Whi  the rest of the corps were so preparing William whole thoughts were bent on contriving how h  might desert But alas he was watched on a  sides he could not possibly devise any means  escape The danger increased every moment th  battle came on William who had been so sure an  confident before he entered flinched in the m  +ment of trial while his more quiet and less boas  +ful comrades prepared boldly to do their dut  ▪ William looked about on all sides and saw th  there was no eye upon him for he did not kno  that the  King's  eye was every where at once  at last thought he spied a chance of escaping n  from the enemy but from his own army Whi  he was endeavouring to escape a ball from the o  +posite camp took off his leg As he fell the fir  ords which broke from him were "while I was  my duty I was prese  ed in the very act of de  rting I am wounded" He lay expecting every  oment to be trampled to death but as soon as the  onfusion was a little over he was taken off the  eld by some of his own party laid in a place of  fety and left to himself after his wound was  ressed  The skirmish for it proved nothing more was  on over The greater part of the regiment es  ped in safety while the few who fell  rejoiced  at they fell in their duty William in the mean  e suffered cruelly both in mind and body To  e pains of a wounded soldier he added the dis  ace of a coward and the infamy of a deserter ▪O" cried he "why was I such a fool as to leave  e  great family  I lived in where there was meat  d drink enough and to spare only on account of little quarrel I might have made up that with  em as we had done our former quarrels Why  d I leave a life of ease and pleasure where I had  ly a little rub now and then for a life of daily  scipline and constant danger Why did I turn  dier O what a miserable animal is a soldier"  As he was sitting in this weak and disabled con  ion uttering the above complaints he observed  enerable old officer with thin grey locks on his  ad and on his face deep wrinkles engraved by  e and many an honest scar inflicted by war  illiam had heard this old officer highly com  nded for his extraordinary courage and conduct  battle and in peace he used to see him cool  d collected devoutly employed in reading and  ying in the interval of more active duties He  ld not help comparing this officer with himself  "I" said he "flinched and drew back and wou  even have deserted in the moment of peril an  now in return I have no consolation in the ho  of repose and safety I would not fight then I ca  not pray now O why would I ever think of bei  a soldier He then began afresh to weep and l  +ment and he groaned so loud that he drew th  notice of the officer who came up to him kind  sat down by him took him by the hand and i  +quired with as much affection as if he had been h  brother what was the matter with him and wh  particular distress more than the common fortu  of war it was which drew from him such bitt  groans" "I know something of surgery" add  he "let me examine your wound and assist yo  with such little comforts as I can"  William at once saw the difference betwe  the soldiers in the  King's  army and the peop  in the  great family  the latter commonly withdr  their kindness in sickness and trouble when m  wanted which was just the very time when  others came forward to assist He told the offi  his little history the manner of his living in  great family  the trifling cause of his quarrelli  with it the slight ground of his entering i  the  King's  service "Sir" said he "I quarr  +led with the family and I thought I was at o  fit for the army I did not know the qualificati  it required I had not reckoned on discipli  and hardships and selfdenial I liked well enou  to sing a loyal song or drink the King's heal  but I find I do not relish working and fighting  him though I rashly promised even to lay do  my life for his service if called upon when I to  the bounty money and the oath of allegian  n short sir I find that I long for the ease and  oth the merriment and the feasting of my old  ervice I find I cannot be a soldier and to speak  ruth I was in the very act of deserting when  was stopped short by the cannon ball So that I  el the guilt of deserting and the misery of hav  g lost my leg into the bargain"  The officer thus replied "your state is that of  very worldly irreligious man The  great family  ou served is a just picture of the WORLD The  ages the world promises to those who are willing to  o its work are high but the payment is attended  ith much disappointment nay the world like  our great family is in itself insolvent and in its  ery nature incapable of making good the pro  ises and of paying the high rewards which it  olds out to tempt its credulous followers The  ngodly world like your family cares little for  urch and still less for prayers and considers  e Bible rather as an instrument to make an oath  nding in order to keep the vulgar in obedi  ce than as containing in itself a perfect rule of  ith and practice and as a titledeed to heaven  he generality of men love the world as you did  our service while it smiles upon them and gives  em easy work and plenty of meat and drink but  soon as it begins to cross and contradict them  ey get out of humour with it just as you did  ith your service They then think its drudgery  rd its rewards low They find out that it is  gh in its expectations from them and slack in  payments to them And they begin to fancy  ecause they do not hear religious people mur  ur as they do that there must be some happiness  religion The world which takes no account of  their deeper sins at length brings them into discr  +dit for some act of imprudence just as your fami  overlooked your lying and swearing but threa  +ened to drub you for breaking a china dish su  is the judgment of the world it particular  bears with those who only break the laws  God but severely punishes the smallest neg  +gence by which property is injured The wor  sooner pardons the breaking ten commandmen  of God than even a china dish of its own  After some cross or opposition worldly men  I said before begin to think how much content a  cheerfulness they remember to have seen in religio  people They therefore begin to fancy that re  +gion must be an easy and delightful as well as  good thing They have heard that "her wa  are ways of pleasantness and all her paths a  peace" and they persuade themselves that  this is meant worldly pleasantness and sensu  peace They resolve at length to try it to tu  their back upon the world to engage in t  service of God and turn christians just as y  resolved to leave your old service to enter i  the service of the King and turn soldier But  you quitted your place in a passion so they lea  the world in a huff They do not count the  ▪ They do not calculate upon the darling sins the  +bitual pleasures the ease and vanities which  undertake by their new engagements to renoun  any more than you counted what indulgences  were going to give up when you quitted the lu  +ries and idleness of your place to enlist in the  +dier's warfare They have as I said seen ch  +tians cheerful and they mistook the ground  their cheerfulness they fancied it arose not  cause through grace they had conquered diffic  +  es  but because they had no difficulties in their  assage They fancied that religion found the road  ooth whereas it only helps to bear with a rough  ad without complaint They do not know that  ese Christians are of good cheer not because the  orld is free from tribulation but because Christ  eir captain has "overcome the world" But the  religious man who has only seen the outside of a  hristian in his worldly intercourse knows little of  secret conflicts his trials his selfdenials his  arfare with the world without and with his own  rrupt desires within  The irreligious man quarrels with the world on  me such occasion as you did with your place  now puts on the outward forms and ceremo  es of religion and assumes the badges of Chris  nity just as you were struck with the shows of  field day just as you were pleased with the  usic and the marching and put on the cockade and  e red coat All seems smooth for a little while  e goes through the outward exercises of a Chris  n a degree of credit attends his new profes  on but he never suspects there is either diffi  lty or discipline attending it he fancies reli  ion is a thing for talking about and not a thing  the heart and the life He never suspects that  the psalmsinging he joins in and the sermons he  ars and the other means he is using are only  the exercises and the evolutions of the soldiers  fit and prepare him for actual service and that  ese means are no more religion itself than the  ercises and evolutions of your parade were real  arsare  At length some trial arises This nominal Chris  an is called to differ from the world in some  great point something happens which may stri  at his comfort or his credit or security T  cools his zeal for religion just as the view of  engagement cooled your courage as a soldie  ▪ He finds he was only  angry  with the world  was not  tired  of it He was out of humour wi  the world not because he had seen through  vanity and emptiness but because the world w  out of humour with him He finds that it is  easy thing to be a fairweather Christian b  where there is nothing to be done and confide  where there is nothing to be feared Difficult  unmask him to others temptations unmask h  to himself he discovers that though he is a hi  professor he is no Christian just as you fou  out that your red coat and your cockade yo  shoulderknot and your musket did not preve  you from being a coward  Your misery in the military life like that of  nominal
