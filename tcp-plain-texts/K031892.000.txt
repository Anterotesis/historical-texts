 J Clark  A Bold Stroke for a WIFE A COMEDY As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL IN LINCOLN'SINNFIELDS  By the Author of the BUSIEBODY and the GAMESTER  Omnia Vincit Amor  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON  Printed for W MERES and F CLAY without  TempleBar  MDCCXXIV Price One Shilling  To His Grace  PHILIP  DUKE and MARQUIS of  WHARTON  c  MY LORD  _IT has ever been the Custom of Poets to shelter Productions of this Nature under the Patronage of the brightest Men of their Time and 'tis observ'd that the Muses always met the kindest Reception from Persons of the greatest Merit The World will do me Justice as to the Choice of my Patron but will I fear  blame my rash Attempt in daring to Address Your Grace and offer at a Work too difficult for our ablest Pens  viz  an Encomium on Your Grace I have no Plea against such just Reflections but the Disadvantage of Education and the Privilege of my Sex  If Your Grace discovers a Genius so surprising in this Dawn of Life what must your riper Years produce Your Grace has already been distinguish'd in a most peculiar Manner being the first Young Nobleman that ever was admitted into a House of Peers before he reached the Age of One and Twenty But Your Grace's Judgment and Eloquence soon convinced that August Assembly that the excelling Gifts of Nature ought not to be confin'd to Time We hope the Example which  Ireland  has set will shortly be followed by an  English  House of Lords and Your Grace made a Member of that Body to which You will be so Conspicuous an Ornament  Your good Sense and real Love for your Country taught Your Grace to persevere in the Principles of your Glorious  Ancestors by adhering to the Defender of our Religion and Laws and the penetrating Wisdom of Your Royal Master saw you merited your Honours ere he conferr'd them It is one of the greatest Glories of a Monarch to distinguish where to bestow his Favours and the World must do ours Justice by owning Your Grace's Titles most deservedly worn  It is with the greatest Pleasure imaginable the Friends of Liberty see You pursuing the Steps of Your Noble Father Your Courteous Affable Temper free from Pride and Ostentation makes Your Name ador'd in the Country and enables Your Grace to carry what Point You please The late Lord  Wharton  will be still remember'd by every Lover of his Country which never felt a greater Shock than what his Death occasion'd Their Grief had been inconsolable if Heaven out of its wonted Beneficence to this Favourite Isle had not transmitted all his shining Qualities to you and Phenix like raised up one Patriot out of the Ashes of another  That Your Grace has a high Esteem for Learning particularly appears by the large Progress you have made therein and your Love for the Muses shews a Sweetness of Temper and Generous Humanity peculiar to the Greatness of Your Soul for such Virtues reign not in the Breast of every Man of Quality  Defer no longer then my Lord to charm the World with the Beauty of your Numbers and shew the Poet as you have done the Orator convince our unthinking  Britous  by what vile Arts  France  lost her Liberty and teach 'em to avoid their own Misfortunes as well as to weep over  Henry  IV who if it were possible for him to know would forgive the bold Assassin's Hand for the Honour of having his Fall celebrated by Your Grace's Pen  To be distinguish'd by Persons of Your Grace's Character is not only the highest Ambition but the greatest Reputation to an Author and it is not the least of my Vanities to have it known to the Publick I had Your Grace's Leave to prefix Your Name to this Comedy  I wish I were capable to cloath the following Scenes in such a Dress as might be worthy to appear before Your Grace and draw Your Attention as much as Your Grace's admirable Qualifications do that of all Mankind but the Muses like most Females are least liberal to their own Sex  All I dare say in Favour of this Piece is that the Plot is entirely New and the Incidents wholly owing to my own Invention not borrow'd from our own or translated from the Works of any Foreign Poet so that they have at least the Charm of Novelty to recommend 'em If they are so lucky in some leisure Hour to give Your Grace the Least Diversion they will answer the utmost Ambition of my Lord  Your GRACE's most Obedient Most Devoted and Most Humble Servant SUSANNA CENTLIVRE  RROLOGUE  By a GENTLEMAN  Spoken by Mrs THURMOND  TONight we come upon a bold Design  To try to please without one borrow'd Line  Our Plot is new and regularly clear  And not one single Tittle from  Moliere  O'er bury'd Poets we with Caution tread  And Parish Sextons leave to rob the Dead  For you bright  British  Fair in hopes to charm ye  We bring Tonight a Lover from the Army  You know the Soldiers have the strangest Arts  Such a Proportion of prevailing Parts  You'd think that they rid Post to Womens Hearts  I wonder whence they draw their bold Pretence  We do not chuse them sure for our Defence  That Plea is both impolitick and wrong  And only suits such Dames as want a Tongue  Is it their Eloquence and fine Address  The Softness of their LanguageNothing less  Is it their Courage that they bravely dare  To storm the Sex at onceEgad 'tis there  They act by us as in the rough Campaign  Unmindful of Repulses charge again  They Mine and Countermine resolv'd to win  And if a Breach is madethey will come in  You'll think by what we have of Soldiers said  Our Female Wit was in the Service bred  But she is to the hardy Toil a Stranger  She loves the Cloth indeed but hates the Danger  Yet to this Circle of the Brave and Gay  She bid me for her good Intentions say  She hopes you'll not reduce her to HalfPay  As for our Play 'tis  English  Humour all  Then will you let our Manufacture fall  Would you the Honour of our Nation raise  Keep  English  Credit up and  English  Plays  Dramtis Personae  MEN  Sir  Philip Modelove  an Old Beau  All Guardians to Mrs  Lovely  by  Mr

Freeman  over a Bottle  FREEMAN  _COME  Colonel  His Majesty's HealthYou are as melancholly as if you were in Love I wish some of the Beauties at  Bath  ha'n't snapt your Heart  Col  Why faith  Freeman  there is something in't I have seen a Lady at  Bath  who has kindled such a Flame in me that all the Waters there can't quench  Free  Women like some poisonous Animals carry their Antidote about 'emIs she not to be had  Colonel  Col  That's a difficult Question to answer however I resolve to try Perhaps you may be able to serve me you Merchants know one anotherThe Lady told me herself she was under the Charge of four Persons  Free  Odso 'tis Mrs  Ann Lovely  Col  The same do you know her  Free  Know her AyFaith  Colonel  your Condition is more desperate than you imagine why she is the Talk and Pity of the whole Town and it is the Opinion of the Learned that she must die a Maid  Col  Say you so That's somewhat odd in this charitable CityShe's a Woman I hope  Free  For ought I know but it had been as well for her had Nature made her any other Part of the Creation The Man which keeps this House serv'd her Father he is a very honest Fellow and may be of use to you we'll send for him to take a Glass with us he'll give you the whole History and 'tis worth your hearing  Col  But may one trust him  Free  With your Life I have Obligations enough upon him to make him do any thing I serve him with Wine  Knocks  Col  Nay I know him pretty well my self I once us'd to frequent a Club that was kept here  Enter Drawer  Draw  Gentlemen d'you call  Free  Ay send up your Master  Draw  Yes Sir  Exit  Col  Do you know any of this Lady's Guardians  Freeman  Free  Yes I know two of them very well  Col  What are they  Enter  Sackbut  Free  Here comes one will give you an Account of them allMr  Sackbut  we sent for you to take a Glass with us 'Tis a Maxim among the Friends of the Bottle that as long as the Master is in Company one may be sure of good Wine  Sack  Sir you shall be sure to have as good Wine as you send in  Colonel  your most humble Servant you are welcome to Town  Col  I thank you Mr  Sackbut  Sack  I am as glad to see you as I should a Hundred Tun of  French  Claret Customfreemy Service to you Sir  Drinks  You don't look so merry as you us'd to do are you not well  Colonel  Free  He has got a Woman in his Head Landlord can you help him  Sack  If 'tis in my Power I shan't scruple to serve my Friend  Col  'Tis one Perquisite of your Calling  Sack  Ay at t'other End of the Town where you Officers use Women are good Forcers of Trade a wellcustom'd House a handsome Barkeeper with clean obliging Drawers soon get the Master an Estate but our Citizens seldom do any thing but cheat within the WallsBut as to the Lady  Colonel  point you at Particulars or have you a good  Champagne  Stomack Are you in full Pay or reduc'd  Colonel  Col  Reduc'd reduc'd Landlord  Free  To the miserable Condition of a Lover  Sack  Pish That's preferrable to Halfpay a Woman's Resolution may break before the Peace push her home  Colonel  there's no parlying with that Sex  Col  Were the Lady her own Mistress I have some Reasons to believe I should soon command in Chief  Free  You know Mrs  Lovely  Mr  Sackbut  Sack  Know her Ay poor  Nancy  I have carried her to School many a frosty Morning Alas if she's the Woman I pity you  Colonel  Her Father my old Master was the most whimsical outoftheway temper'd Man I ever heard of as you will guess by his last Will and TestamentThis was his only Child I have heard him wish her dead a thousand times  Col  Why so  Sack  He hated Posterity you must know and wish'd the World were to expire with himselfHe used to swear if she had been a Boy he would have qualify'd him for the  Opera  Free  'Tis a very unnatural Resolution in a Father  Sack  He dy'd worth Thirty thousand Pounds which he left to this Daughter provided she married with the Consent of her Guardians But that she might be sure never to do so he left her in the Care of four Men as opposite to each other as Light and Darkness Each has his quarterly Rule and three Months in a Year she is oblig'd to be subject to each of their Humours and they are pretty different I assure youShe is just come from  Bath  Col  'Twas there I saw her  Sack  Ay Sir the last Quarter was her Beau Guardian'sShe appears in all publick Places during his Reign  Col  She visited a Lady who boarded in the same House with me I lik'd her Person and found an Opportunity to tell her so She reply'd she had no Objection to mine but if I could not reconcile Contradictions I must not think of her for that she was condemned to the Caprice of four Persons who never yet agreed in any one thing and she was oblig'd to please them all  Sack  'Tis most true Sir I'll give you a short Description of the Men and leave you to judge of the poor Lady's Condition One is a kind of a  Virtuoso  a silly halfwitted Fellow but positive and surly fond of nothing but what is Antique and Foreign and wears his Cloaths of the Fashion of the last Century doats upon Travellers and believes Sir  John Mandiville  more than the Bible  Col  That must be a rare old Fellow  Sack  Another is a ChangeBroker a Fellow that will outlie the Devil for the Advantage of Stock and cheat his Father that got him in a Bargain He is a great Stickler for Trade and hates every thing that wears a Sword  Free  He is a great Admirer of the  Dutch  Management and swears they understand Trade better than any Nation under the Sun  Sack  The Third is an old Beau that has  May  in his Fancy and Dress but  December  in his Face and his Heels  he admires nothing but new Fashions and those must be  French  loves Operas Balls Masquerades and is always the most tawdry of the whole Company on a Birthday  Col  These are pretty opposite to one another truly And the fourth what is he Landlord  Sack  A very rigid  Quaker  whose Quarter begun this DayI saw Mrs  Lovely  go in not above two Hours agoSir  Philip  set her down What think you now  Colonel  is not the poor Lady to be pity'd  Col  Ay and rescued too Landlord  Free  In my Opinion that's impossible  Col  There is nothing impossible to a Lover What would not a Man attempt for a fine Woman and Thirty Thousand Pounds Besides my Honour is at Stake I promis'd to deliver herand she bad me win her and take her  Sack  That's fair faith  Free  If it depended upon KnightErrantry I should not doubt your setting free the Damsel but to have Avarice Impertinence Hypocrifie and Pride at once to deal with requires more Cunning than generally attends a Man of Honour  Col  My Fancy tells me I shall come off with Glory I resolve to try howeverDo you know all the Guardians Mr  Sackbut  Sack  Very well Sir they all use my House  Col  And will you assist me if occasion be  Sack  In every thing I can  Colonel  Free  I'll answer for him and whatever I can serve you in you may depend on I know Mr  Periwinkle  and Mr  Tradelove  the latter has a very great Opinion of my Interest AbroadI happen'd to have a Letter from a Correspondent two Hours before the News arrived of the  French  King's Death I communicated it to him upon which he bought up all the Stock he could and what with that and some Wagers he laid he told me he had got to the Tune of Five Hundred Pounds so that I am much in his good Graces  Col  I don't know but you may be of Service to me  Freeman  Free  If I can command me  Colonel  Col  Is it not possible to find a Suit of Cloaths ready made at some of these Sale Shops fit to rig out a Beau think you Mr  Sackbut  Sack  O hang 'emNo  Colonel  they keep nothing readymade that a Gentleman would be seen in But I can fit you with a Suit of Cloaths if you'd make a FigureVelvet and Gold Brocadethey were pawn'd to me by a  French  Count who had been stript at Play and wanted Money to carry him home he promis'd to send for them but I have heard nothing from him  Free  He has not fed upon Frogs long enough yet to recover his Loss ha ha  Col  Ha haWell those Cloaths will do Mr  Sackbut  tho' we must have three or four Fellows in tawdry Liveries those can be procur'd I hope  Free  Egad I have a Brother come from the  WestIndies  that can match you and for Expedition sake you shall have his Servants there's a Black a Tawnymoor and a  Frenchman  they don't speak one Word of  English  so can make no Mistake  Col  ExcellentEgad I shall look like an  Indian  Prince First I'll attack my BeauGuardian where lives he  Sack  Faith somewhere about St  James  's tho' to say in what Street I cannot but any Chairman will tell you where Sir  Philip Modelove  lives  Free  Oh you'll find him in the  Park  at Eleven every Day at least I never pass'd thro' at that Hour without seeing him thereBut what do you intend  Col  To address him in his own Way and find what he designs to do with the Lady  Free  And what then  Col  Nay that I can't tell but I shall take my Measures accordingly  Sack  Well 'tis a mad Undertaking in my Mind but here's to your Success  Colonel  Drinks  Col  'Tis something out of the Way I confess but Fortune may chance to smile and I succeedCome Landlord let me see those Cloaths  Freeman  I shall expect you'll leave Word with Mr  Sackbut  where one may find you upon occasion and send my Equipage of  India  immediately do you hear  Free  Immediately  Exit  Col  Bold was the Man who ventur'd first to Sea  But the first vent'ring Lovers bolder were  The Path of Love's a dark and dangerous Way  Without a Landmark or one friendly Star  And he that runs the Risque deserves the Fair  Exit  SCENE II  Prim  's House  Enter Mrs  Lovely  and her Maid  Betty  Betty  Bless me Madam why do you fret and teaze your self so This is giving them the Advantage with a Witness  Mrs Lov  Must I be condemned all my Life to the preposterous Humours of other People and pointed at by every Boy in TownOh I could tear my Flesh and curse the Hour I was bornIs it not monstrously ridiculous that they should desire to impose their Quaking Dress upon me at these Years When I was a Child no matter what they made me wear but now  Betty  I wou'd resolve against it  Madam  I'd see 'em hang'd before I'd put on the pinch'd Cap again  Mrs Lov  Then I must never expect one Moment's Ease she has rung such a Peal in my Ears already that I shan't have the right Use of them this MonthWhat can I do  Betty  What can you not do if you will but give your Mind to it Marry Madam  Mrs Lov  What and have my Fortune go to build Churches and Hospitals  Betty  Why let it goIf the  Colonel  loves you as he pretends he'll marry you without a Fortune Madam and I assure you a  Colonel  's Lady is no despicable thing a  Colonel  's Post will maintain you like a Gentlewo+man Madam  Mrs Lov  So you wou'd advise me to give up my own Fortune and throw my self upon the  Colonel  's  Betty  I would advise you to make your self easie Madam  Mrs Lov  That's not the Way I am sure No no Girl there are certain Ingredients to be mingled with Matrimony without which I may as well change for the worse as for the better When the Woman has Fortune enough to make the Man happy if he has either Honour or Good Manners he'll make her easie Love makes but a slovenly Figure in that House where Poverty keeps the Door  Betty  And so you resolve to die a Maid do you Madam  Mrs Love  Or have it in my Power to make the Man I love Master of my Fortune  Betty  Then you don't like the  Colonel  so well as I thought you did Madam or you would not take such a Resolution  Mrs Love  It is because I do like him  Betty  that I take such a Resolution  Betty  Why do you expect Madam the  Colonel  can work Miracles Is it possible for him to marry you with the Consent of all your Guardians  Mrs Love  Or he must not marry me at all and so I told him and he did not seem displeas'd with the NewsHe promis'd to set me free and I on the Condition promis'd to make him Master of that Freedom  Betty  Well I have read of inchanted Castles Ladies delivered from the Chains of Magick Giants kill'd and Monsters overcome so that I shall be the less surpriz'd if the  Colonel  should conjure your  out of the Power of your Guardians If he does I am sure he deserves your Fortune  Mrs Lov  And shall have it Girl if it were ten times as muchFor I'll ingenuously confess to thee that I do like the  Colonel  above all Men I ever sawThere's something so  Jantée  in a Soldier a kind of a  Je ne scay quoi  Air that makes 'em more agreeable than the rest of MankindThey command Regard as who should say We are your Defenders We preserve your Beauties from the Insults of rude unpolish'd Foes and ought to be preferr'd before those lazy indolent Mortals who by dropping into their Fathers Estate set up their Coaches and think to rattle themselves into our Affections  Betty  Nay Madam I confess that the Army has engross'd all the prettiest FellowsA lac'd Coat and Feather have irresistable Charms  Mrs Lov  But the  Colonel  has all the Beauties of the Mind as well as PersonO all ye Powers that favour happy Lovers grant he may be mine Thou God of Love if thou be'st ought but Name assist my  Fainwell  Point all thy Darts to aid my Love's Design  And make his Plots as prevalent as thine  The End of the First ACT  ACT II  SCENE  SCENE the  Park  Enter  Colonel  finely drest three Footmen after him  Col  So now if I can but meet this Beau'Egad methinks I cut a smart Figure and have as much of the tawdry Air as any  Italian  Count or  French  Marquée of 'em allSure I shall know this Knight againah yonder he sits making Love to a Mask i'faith I'll walk up the  Mall  and come down by him  Exit  SCENE draws and discovers Sir  Philip  upon a Bench with a Woman mask'd  Sir Phil  Well but my Dear are you really constant to your Keeper  Wom  Yes really Sirhey day who comes yonder he cuts a mighty Figure  Sir Phil  Ha A Stranger by his Equipage keeping so close at his HeelsHe has the Appearance of a Man of QualityPositively  French  by his dancing Air  Wom  He crosses as if he meant to sit down here  Sir Phil  He has a mind to make love to thee Child  Enter  Colonel  and seats himself upon the Bench by Sir  Philip  Wom  It will be to no Purpose if he does  Sir Phil  Are you resolv'd to be cruel then  Col  You must be very cruel indeed if you can deny any thing to so fine a Gentleman Madam  Takes out his Watch  Wom  I never mind the Outside of a Man  Col  And I'm afraid thou art no Judge of the Inside  Sir Phil  I am positively of your Mind Sir For Creatures of her Function seldom penetrate beyond the Pocket  Wom  Creatures of your Composition have indeed generally more in their Pockets than in their Heads  Aside  Sir Phil  Pray what says your Watch mine is down  Pulling out his Watch  Col  I want Minutes of Twelve Sir  Puts up his Watch and takes out his SnuffBox  Sir Phil  May I presume Sir  Col  Sir you honour me  Presenting the Box  Sir Phil  He speaks good  English  tho' he must be a Foreignerthis Snuff is extreamly goodand the Box prodigious fine the Work is  French  I presume Sir  Col  I bought it in  Paris  SirI do think the Workmanship pretty neat  Sir Phil  Neat 'tis exquisitely fine Sir pray Sir if I may take the Liberty of inquiringwhat Country is so happy to claim the Birth of the finest Gentleman in the Universe  France  I presume  Col  Then you don't think me an  Englishman  Sir Phil  No upon my Soul don't I  Col  I am sorry for't  Sir Phil  Impossible you should wish to be an  Englishman  Pardon me Sir this Island could not produce a Person of such Alertness  Col  As this Mirrour shews you Sir  Puts up a PocketGlass to Sir  Philip  's Face  Wom  Coxcombs I'm sick to hear 'em praise one another one seldom gets any thing by such Animals not even a Dinner unless one can dine upon Soop and Sallery  Exit  Sir Phil  O Ged Sir Will you leave us Madam ha ha  Col  She fears 'twill be only losing Time to stay here ha haI know not how to distinguish you  Sir but your Mien and Address speak you  Right Honourable  Sir Phil  Thus great Souls judge of others by themselvesI am only adorn'd with Knighthood that's all I assure you Sir my Name is Sir  Philip Modelove  Col  Of  French  Extraction  Sir Phil  My Father was  French  Col  One may plainly perceive itthere is a certain Gaiety peculiar to my Nation for I will own my self a  Frenchman  which distinguishes us every where A Person of your Figure would be a vast Addition to a Coronet  Sir Phil  I must own I had the Offer of a Barony about five Years ago but I abhorr'd the Fatigue which must have attended itI could never yet bring my self to join with either Party  Col  You are perfectly in the right Sir  Philip  a fine Person should not embark himself in the slovenly Concern of Politicks Dress and Pleasure are Objects proper for the Soul of a fine Gentleman  Sir Phil  And Love  Col  Oh that's included under the Article of Pleasure  Sir Phil  Parbleu il est un homme d'esprit  I must embrace you  Rises and embraces  Your Sentiments are so agreeable to mine that we appear to have but one Soul for our Ideas and Conceptions are the same  Col  I should be sorry for that  aside  You do me too much Honour Sir  Philip  Sir Phil  Your Vivacity and  Jantée  Mien assured me at first sight there was nothing of this foggy Island in your Composition May I crave your Name Sir  Col  My Name is  La Fainwell  Sir at you Service  Sir Phil  The  La Fainwells  are  French  I know tho' the Name is become very numerous in  Great Britain  of late YearsI was sure you was  French  the Moment I laid my Eyes upon you I could not come in to the Supposition of your being an  Englishman  this Island produces few such Ornaments  Col  Pardon me Sir  Philip  this Island has two things superior to all Nations under the Sun  Sir Phil  Ay what are they  Col  The Ladies and the Laws  Sir Phil  The Laws indeed do claim a Preference of other Nationsbut by my Soul there are fine Women every whereI must own I have felt their Power in all Countries  Col  There are some finish'd Beauties I confess in  France Italy Germany  nay even in  Holland mais sont bien rare  But  les belles Angloises  Oh Sir  Philip  where find we such Women such Symetry of Shape such Elegancy of Dress such Regularity of Features such Sweetness of Temper such commanding Eyes and such bewitching Smiles  Sir Phil  Ah  parbleu vous estéz attrapér  Col  Non je vous assure Chevalier  but I declare there is no Amusement so agreeable to my  Goût  as the Conversation of a fine WomanI could never be prevail'd upon to enter into what the Vulgar calls the Pleasure of the Bottle  Sir Phil  My own Taste  positivement  A Ball or a Masquerade is certainly preferable to all the Productions of the Vineyard  Col  Infinitely I hope the People of Quality in  England  will support that Branch of Pleasure which was imported with their Peace and since naturaliz'd by the ingenious Mr  Heidegger  Sir Phil  The Ladies assure me it will become Part of the Constitutionupon which I subscrib'd a hundred Guineasit will be of great Service to the Publick at least to the Company of Surgeons and the City in general  Col  Ha ha it may help to ennoble the Blood of the City Are you married Sir  Philip  Sir Phil  No nor do I believe I ever shall enter into that honourable State I have an absolute Tender for the whole Sex  Col  That's more than they have for you I dare swear  Aside  Sir Phil  And I have the Honour to be very well with the Ladies I can assure you Sir and I won't affront a Million of fine Women to make one happy  Col  Nay Marriage is really reducing a Man's Taste to a kind of half Pleasure but then it carries the Blessing of Peace along with it one goes to sleep without Fear and wakes without Pain  Sir Phil  There's something of that in't a Wife is a very good Dish for an  English  Stomachbut gross Feeding for nicer Palates ha ha ha  Col  I find I was very much mistakenI imagin'd you had been married to that young Lady which I saw in the Chariot with you this Morning in  Gracechurchstreet  Sir Phil  Who  Nancy Lovely  I am a Piece of a Guardian to that Lady you must know her Father I thank him join'd me with three of the most preposterous old Fellowsthat upon my Soul I'm in pain for the poor Girlshe must certainly lead Apes as the Saying is ha ha  Col  That's pity Sir  Philip  if the Lady would give me leave I would endeavour to avert that Curse  Sir Phil  As to the Lady she'd gladly be rid of us at any Rate I believe but here's the Mischief he who marries Miss  Lovely  must have the Consent of us all fouror not a Penny of her PortionFor my Part I shall never approve of any but a Man of Figureand the rest are not only averse to Cleanliness but have each a peculiar Taste to gratifyFor my Part I declare I would prefer you to all Men I ever saw  Col  And I her to all Women  Sir Phil  I assure you Mr  Fainwell  I am for marrying her for I hate the Trouble of a Guardian especially among such Wretches but resolve never to agree to the Choice of any one of themand I fancy they'll be even with me for they never came into any Proposal of mine yet  Col  I wish I had your Leave to try them Sir  Philip  Sir Phil  With all my Soul Sir I can refuse a Person of your Appearance nothing  Col  Sir I am infinitely oblig'd to you  Sir Phil  But do you really like Matrimony  Col  I believe I could with that Lady Sir  Sir Phil  The only Point in which we differbut you are Master of so many Qualifications that I can excuse one Fault for I must think it a Fault in a fine Gentleman and that you are such I'll give it under my hand  Col  I wish you'd give me your Consent to marry Mrs  Lovely  under your Hand Sir  Philip  Sir Phil  I'll do'r if you'll step into St  James  's CoffeeHouse where we may have Pen and Inktho' I can't foresee what Advantage my Consent will be to you without you could find a way to get the rest of the Guardiansbut I'll introduce you however she is now at a  Quaker  's where I carried her this Morning when you saw us in  Gracechurchstreet  I assure you she has an odd  Ragoût  of Guardians as you will find when you hear the Characters which I'll endeavour to give you as we go alongHey  Pierre Jaque Renno  where are you all ScoundrelsOrder the Chariot to St  James  's CoffeeHouse  Col  Le Noir la Brun le BlancMortblu ou sont ces Coquinsla Alons Monsieur le Chevalier  Sir Phil  Ah  Pardonnez moy Monsieur  Col  Not one Step upon my Soul Sir  Philip  Sir Phil  The bestbred Man in  Europe  positively  Exeunt  SCENE Changes to  Obediah Prim  's House  Enter Mrs  Lovely  follow'd by Mrs  Prim  Mrs Pr  Then thou wilt not obey me and thou do'st really think those Fallals becometh thee  Mrs Lov  I do indeed  Mrs Pr  Now will I be judged by all sober People if I don't look more like a modest Woman than thou dost  Anne  Mrs Lov  More like a Hypocrite you mean Mrs  Prim  Mrs Pr  Ah  Anne Anne  that wicked  Philip Modelove  will undo thee  Satan  so fills thy Heart with Pride during the three Months of his Guardianship that thou becomest a Stumblingblock to the Upright  Mrs Lov  Pray who are they Are the pinch'd Cap and formal Hood the Emblems of Sanctity Does your Virtue consist in your Dress Mrs  Prim  Mrs Pr  It doth not consist in cut Hair spotted Face and bare NecksOh the Wickedness of this Generation The Primitive Women knew not the Abomination of hoop'd Petticoats  Mrs Lov  No nor the Abomination of Cant neither Don't tell me Mrs  Prim  don'tI know you have as much Pride Vanity Selfconceit and Ambition among you couch'd under that formal Habit and sanctify'd Countenance as the proudest of us all but the World begins to see your Prudry  Mrs Pr  Prudry What do they invent new Words as well as new Fashions Ah poor fantastick Age I pity theepoor deluded  Anne  Which dost thou think most resemblest the Saint and which the Sinner thy Dress or mine Thy naked Bosom allureth the Eye of the Bystanderencourageth the Frailty of Humane Natureand corrupteth the Soul with evil Longings  Mrs Lov  And pray who corrupted your Son  Tobias  with evil Longings Your Maid  Tabitha  wore a Handkerchief and yet he made the Saint a Sinner  Mrs Pr  Well well spit thy MaliceI confess  Satan  did buffet my Son  Tobias  and my Servant  Tabitha  the Evil Spirit was at that time too strong and they both became subject to its Workingsnot from any outward Provocationbut from an inward Callhe was not tainted with the Rottenness of the Fashions nor did his Eyes take in the Drunkenness of Beauty  Mrs Lov  No that's plainly to be seen  Mrs Pr  Tabitha  is one of the Faithful he fell not with a Stranger  Mrs Lov  So Then you hold Wenching no Crime provided it be within the Pale of your own Tribeyou are an excellent Casuist truly  Enter
