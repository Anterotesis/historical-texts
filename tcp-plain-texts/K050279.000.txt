 CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE Eighth and Ninth ARTICLES OF THE TREATY OF  Commerce and Navigation  Now publish'd by Authority With some Enquiries into the DAMAGES that may accrue to the  English  Trade from them  LONDON  Printed for  J Baker  at the  Black Boy  in  PaterNosterRow  Price  d  INTRODUCTION  BEFORE any just Observations can be made upon the two Heads which we are now to consider it is absolutely necessary to let the Reader a little into the general Knowledge of the State of the Commerce between  England  and  France  as it now stands and this cannot be done so as to give him a clear Understanding in the reading either the Treaty it self or these Considerations without letting him know what the Meaning of the Tariff of and the Tariff of so often now to be made mention of is and as far as will consist with the Brevity of this Tract to give an Abridgement of those Tariffs as they concern the present Treaty of Commerce The Necessity of understanding these Things perfectly before we can make any Judgment of the Matter in hand is such that it seems the most natural Introduction that could possibly be made to the Work and without which however the Book is written in  English  it would be an unknown Tongue to most of the Readers and might as well have been written in  Arabick  or any other Language or Character which no body could understand  A  TARIFF in the French  as it may best be expounded to us in a TradingDialect is no more or less than  a Book of Rates  establishing the Duties and Customs of Goods exported and imported from and to the Kingdom of  France  It is true if you speak literally it is the Acts of publick Authority from whence the Books of Rates are collected as our  Books of Rates  are so many Abstracts of the Acts of Parliament by which those Rates are establishe'd and therefore as our Laws of Customs are called Acts of Parliament so those in  France  are called  Edits du Roy Declaration du Roy Ordonnance du Roy Arrest du Conseild' Etat du Roy  and the like and the Collection of them into a Body is call'd in  French Recueil des Tarifs  c and  Table de Tarifs Arrests Reglemens des Droits de Entree Sortie  c that is in  English a Book of Rates  and nothing else  It is therefore a Vulgar Error to think these Tariffs are Treaties between  France  and other Nations and to say the Tariff between  France  and  Holland  or between  France  and  England  c is to talk Nousense or which is much the same thing to say nothing to the Purpose with this Exception only That in several Treaties of Commerce there have been Agreements made and Articles enter'd into especially between  France  and the StatesGeneral by which the Duties of Merchandises have been adjusted respectively and in these Treaties the Tariffs in  France  formerly made have been made the Foundation with such particular Additions respecting the Duties of such or such Goods about which they  have then treated and made any Alteration Of this we have an Example after the Treaty of  Reswick  when by a separate Treaty of Trade tho' in former Cases the Duties in general were adjusted yet new Agreements were made for sundry things the rest being refer'd to the Tariffs of other Years and this was called indeed  Tarif Arreste Entre la France la Hollande  This was the th of  December    It is necessary farther as an Introduction to this Discourse to observe that the general Tariffs or Book of Rates which have been made and are refer'd to in the present Treaties stand thus That of was the most general in which the  English  Merchandises and Manufactures paid upon their Importation into  France  very moderate Duties and particularly of our Woollen Manifactures Thus  Fine  English  Cloth the Piece qt  Ells Livres  Half Cloths or Dozens  Livres  Stockens Worsted  per  Dozen  Sols  Serges the Piece qt  Ells Livres  Cloth Serges  Ells Livres  Scotch  Serges and Shaloons  Ells Livres  And the like of other Merchandises These Duties were enlarg'd in the Year and by an  Arrest du Conseil de Estat    Sept  an entire Prohibition of our Woollen Manufactures was publish'd and new extravagant Duties laid upon those which were allow'd to be enter'd  These Things being necessary to premise by way of Introduction on the Side of the  French  it may suffice on the other Part to observe that by sundry Acts of Parliament made on several Occasions and with various Prospects in  England  several additional Duties and some Prohibitions have been laid upon and against the Goods and Merchandises of the Growth of  France  besides the general Prohibition or final Stop of Intercourse or Commerce between the two Nations occasion'd by the Accident of the War  As to particular Prohibitions the chief are those first against Alamodes and Lustrings in favour of the Company who have erected the Manufactures of that kind here and who if those Prohibitions had not been made could not have succeeded  Also that for a Prohibition of all wrought Silks for the Encouragement of the BroadWeavers in  England  and without which they must have been reduc'd if not quite ruin'd  The high additional Duties were such as principally respect the Wines and Brandies imported hither from  France  which by the several Acts of Parliament establishing those Duties amount at this time as follows  Wine  per  Ton    l  Brandy  per  Gallon    s    d  These Duties being so great as to be equal almost to a Prohibition stand as an Equivalent to the Impositions which the  French  have laid upon ours and is the Foundation of the present Debate  Thus much seems sufficient by way of Introduction  CONSIDERATIONS ON THE Articles  c  As our Considerations extend to no other Part of the Treaty than what relates to Trade and to the Duties and Impositions upon Merchandise so we shall confine it according to the Title to the two particular Articles which have made so much Noise in the Town  viz  the Eighth and Ninth Articles  The Eighth Article runs thus  Furthermore it is agreed and concluded as a general Rule That all and singular the Subjects of the most Serene Queen of  Great Britain  and of the most Serene the most Christian King in all Countries and Places subject to their Power on each Side as to all Duties Impositions or Customs whatsoever concerning Persons Goods and Merchandizes Ships Freights Seamen Navigation and Commerce shall use and enjoy the same Privileges and Immunities at least and have the like favour in all Things as well in the Courts of Justice as in all such things as relate either to Commerce or to any other Right whatever which any Foreign Nation the most favoured  has uses and enjoys or may hereafter have use and enjoy  This Article proposes an Equality in the general Circumstances of Trade for the Subjects of the two Nations in their respective Dominions with the Subjects of other Nations  viz  That  France  shall not demand any Toll Duty Custom Impost PortCharges  c  of the  English  Merchants in any Ports or places of her Dominions more than the Subjects of all other Nations pay in the same Ports and  Vice Versa England  shall do the same  I know it is objected here that this Article directly contravenes the Treaty with  Portugal  and some People lay a great Stress upon that Treaty in which we are oblig'd to admit the  Portugal  Wines at a certain Rate or Duty lower than the  French  Whether the Parliament will think that Treaty relates to a farther Term than the Expiration of the War I shall not determine and this is named because some insist upon it that that Treaty was made for Considerations which wholly related to the War and which Considerations or Conditions on the behalf of  Portugal  as has been mention'd in Parliament were not honourably and punctually perform'd  Vide the Votes of the House of Commons  and Representation and Address last Session Now how far the Queen of  Great Britain  will think Her self bound by that Treaty which on the other hand they say was never perform'd is the Question these People offer in this Case But this I shall not take upon me to determine of here but leave it to the Casuists in those Cases whose Judgments  are founded on the Laws of Nations and the Nature of Treaties  But the Considerations of Trade are of a differing Nature and tho' there were much more to be said for the Interest of the Kingdom respecting Peace and War than we think can be said here yet those things weight not in Arguments of Commerce The present Enquiry is Whether the  French  or  Portugal  Trades are of most Advantage to  England  Many Arguments offer themselves to our View upon this Head but I believe no Man will pretend to say but that as Things stand now the  Portugal  Trade is much more to the general Profit than the  French  because  besides many other Reasons  we make effectual Exportation of our Woollen Manufactures for all the Wines Oyles  c  that we receive from  Portugal  whereas the Obstructions in  France  to our Woollen Goods by the War and the Improvements made in  France  not only in our Woollen Manufactures but in many other things makes that Trade run in a different Channel and the Ballance at least before our Stop to their Wine Brandy and wrought Silks by the high Duties and Prohibitions now in force were against  England  The Argument brought against these things by those who think the Equality of Duties reasonable at least the Argument which is most Cogent is this It may be true that while our Trade to  France  lies under the Discouragements and Disadvantages of their Tariffs of and the Loss is Ours because we export but few of our Woollen Manufactures thither But  the Question is not yet thought of How great a Trade we may have to  France  a Kingdom of so large Extent so populous and so wanting Manufactures of Wooll when those high Duties are taken off and the Tariff of restor'd as by the Ninth Article is propos'd  I shall however state this as impartially between both as possible We are sure that now the Trade to  Portugal  is not only a great but a gainful Trade and we know it is an encreased and an encreasing Trade also it is a Trade  as is mention'd above  especially advantageous to  Britain  in that our whole Import from thence is ballanc'd by our Woollen Manufacture and great Sums brought hither in Specie of Gold every Year This as it is said we are sure of and it can be no Offence to any to say we hope that when Commissioners shall meet as is provided by the Ninth Article to remove the Difficulties and to regulate mutually the Duties and Circumstances of Trade they will be very careful to prevent breaking in too far upon so beneficial a Trade as that to  Portugal  before they have a clear View of making at least an equal Advantage to  Britain  in the Trade to  France  and this may suffice to say at present upon the Affair of general Equallities in Commerce which is the Sustance of the Eighth Article  The Ninth Article requires a farther Discussion and may be particularly divided into three Periods or Heads  The proposal of repealing the Laws on either hand which relate to additional Impost and Duties on Merchandizes in both Kingdoms  and all the Prohibitions of Importation also from the Year  The settling the Duties upon  French  Goods imported into  England  upon the same Foot and at the same Rates upon which Goods of the like Nature are imported from other Parts  The appointing Commissioners not only to adjust the Exceptions and separate Proposals which are not yet settled but to regulate the Methods of future Commerce between the Nations in such a manner as may be for mutual Advantage  The two first of these are contain'd in the first Part of the Ninth Article of the Treaty in these Words  It is further agreed That within the space of two Months after a Law shall be made in  Great Britain  whereby it shall be sufficiently provided that no more Customs or Duties be paid for Goods and Merchandizes brought from  France  to  Great Britain  than what are payable for Goods and Merchandizes of the like Nature Imported into  Great Britain  from any other Country in  Europe  and that all Laws made in  Great Britain  since the Year for Prohibiting the Importation of any Goods and Merchandizes coming from  France  which were not prohibited before that time be repealed the general Tariff made in  France  the th Day of  September  in the Year shall take place there again and the Duties payable in  France  by the Subjects of  Great Britain  for Goods Imported and Exported shall be paid according to the Tenour of the Tariff abovementioned and shall not exceed the Rule therein settled in the Provinces whereof mention  is there made and in the other Provinces the Duty shall not be payable otherwise than according to the Rule at that time prescribed And all Prohibitions Tariffs Edicts Declarations or Decrees made in  France  since the said Tariff of the Year and contrary thereunto in respect to the Goods and Merchandizes of  Great Britain  shall be Repealed  To consider this with all possible Impartiality It must be allow'd that the  French  binding themselves to Repeal all their Tariffs Edicts Declarations or Decrees made in  France  back to the Year entitled them very justly to insist upon the same Thing with us and were we sure that Repealing those Tariffs would open the Door to a Free Trade for our Manufacturers into  France  that Demand would meet with the less Difficulties here and the Alternative be the more just Of which we shall say more when we come to enquire into the Excepted Articles  But altho' this may seem very Just for the  French  to demand yet it will require some Retrospect upon our own Circumstances to consider whether it consists with our Trading Interest to come into this Mutual Repealing of Duties and Prohibitions and indeed whether it be consistent with the very Nature and Being of our Trade As particularly the taking off the Prohibition of  Wrought Silks  which we call  Broad Silks  and that severe Prohibition of  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  It might require here some very mature Thoughts to reflect upon the State of our own Trade  for Example  The Encouragement given to the Making  Lustrings  and  Alamodes  in  England  and upon which the Subscribers to the  LustringCompany  embark'd their Stocks was without question the Prohibition of the  French Silks  of that Kind and the Confidence they had that if at any time that Prohibition expired they should obtain that Encouragement which is generally granted to all New Undertakings of that Nature and without which they are supposed not to be able to promote or set up such Works or at least with any Success this Encouragement is generally the laying large Impositions or actual Prohibitions upon Goods of the same Nature made in other Countries But if on the contrary the Impositions and Prohibitions aforesaid are actually taken off and the Trade laid open so that the like Goods may be admitted upon low Terms from Abroad those Undertakings are Ruin'd of meer Consequence This I take to be the Case of the  LustringCompany  in  London  and I believe the Master or Members of that Company will be free to own that they can make but small Pretence to the carrying on their said Trade if the Prohibition and Duty upon the  French Lustrings  and  Alamodes  should be taken off by this Treaty What Weight the Interest of the Company shall bear in the Consideration of this Great Affair when either the Parliament in general or the Commissioners when nominated to enquire into it in particular shall come to debate it I will not undertake to determine  The Case of our  Broad Weavers  may come next to be mention'd in Favour of whom and in Consideration of the Numbers of Families  maintain'd by the Manufacture of  Silk  in this Nation the General Prohibition of  French Wrought Silks  first and afterwards of  EastIndia Wrought Silks  was made What other Considerations moved the House to those Prohibitions and how importunate the  Weavers  and Importers of  Silk  were to obtain those Prohibitions is too fresh in the Memories of all Men who think of these Things that I need not repeat any thing of it here What a Hurt it will be to the  Silk Manufacture  in  England  I rather leave to the People concern'd to talk of who are apt to be loud enough than to pretend to meddle with it here  It is argued here that the Encrease of the Exportation of our  Woollen Manufactures  will follow by taking off the high Duties in  France  by which that whole Nation will be open to our Sale and we shall Export vast Quantities thither Yearly I say if this be urged as a thing of such Weight to which the Loss in the  Silk Manufactures c  is not to be compared  I readily yield to it  only with this Proviso  viz  that we are certain that Exportation shall so increase I shall allow my self to hope it will do so at least if the Commissioners who are to meet can bring the  French  to consent that the  English Woollen Manufactures  be comprised in the Treaty and the Duties upon them be reduced to the Tariff of Nor will I allow that to be a Question in the Case since the known Interest of their Country so much requires it and the Ruin or Damage to other parts of our Trade will be so just an Equivalent  But as that Notion of the Increase of our  Woollen Manufacture  is an Answer to the Nation in general so here may be an Answer suggested to the  Broad Silk Weavers  and  LustringCompany  in particular  viz  That altho' the Prohibitions be taken off yet still there seems to be a liberty left to  Britain  by this  Ninth Article  to continue or lay any higher Duty on such Foreign  Wrought Silks  as the Government shall think needful to encourage our  Silk Manufactures  and yet the  French  be obliged to Repeal their high Duties at the same time This I say seems plain at least to our common view who can judge of these Things but without doors from these two Circumstances  From the Demand the  French  make of keeping four Species of Goods up to the Rule of the Tariff of which if they insist upon there seems to be a Parity of Reason that our Commissioners may insist upon the like advance of a Duty on the  Wrought Silks  made in  England  Because the Reason of the  French  for holding up their Duties on our  Woollen Manufactures  to the Tariff of is the very same which we would give for Laying a Duty on their  Silks viz  the giving the Manufactures at Home the Advantage against those which are Imported from Abroad and encouraging the proper Subjects of each Kingdom Because it does not contradict the Letter of the Treaty to Lay any new or high Duties or Customs upon the Goods and Merchandizes of any Kind Imported from  France  provided it is no more than is paid upon Goods of the  like Nature Imported from other Parts and I must grant that if this Construction of the Article will hold as I hope and believe it will the Prohibitions may be all Taken off of the  Broad Silks Lustrings Alamodes  c without such Ruin and Destruction to the  Broad Silk Weaving  and  Lustring Trade  as has been apprehended But as the Ministry on both sides must be allowed the Construction of their own Terms and to explain their own Thoughts to one another so it may not be proper to anticipate all the Thoughts our Commissioners may have least it prepare the Enemy to oppose them  The  French  are no more to be look'd upon in Trade as they formerly were  viz  as an Improving and Encroaching People in respect to the General Commerce of  Europe  but as a Nation arriv'd to such an Improvement that they are really our Rivals in the best and greatest Part of our Trade in particular I mean the  Woollen Manufacture  Indeed we have the good Fortune to be on the better side of the Hedge with them and they have the Difficulty of the Want of Materials to struggle with  viz the WOOLL  But then against that by their Art dexterous Management Money and other Helps joined to the Baseness and Treachery of our own People who for Private Gain will set their Hands to the Ruin of their Country They have found the way in spight of severe Laws strict Guards and the utmost Vigilance of Officers to get so great Quantities of our  Wooll  conveyed over to  France  as sufficiently enables them in Conjunction with  Spanish Wooll  and  Wooll  from  Barbary  to make a very great Quantity of  Woollen Manufactures  and thereby do us an Inestimable Damage in our Trade and which is yet more as the People are Poor Industrious and work very low where they are able to make the Goods at all they are sure to underwork and undersell us  For this Reason it must be allow'd that if the  French  can be brought to open a Door for a free Trade that is for an Importation of our  Woollen Manufactures  into  France  with moderate Duties the Value and Gooodness of our  Manufactures  would force their own way so far at least that the Advance they make upon us in those things would not be so great or encrease so fast In order then to come to such a free Trade many things may be thought on and it may be counted rational that  England  should grant all they can be suppos'd to grant and take every Step that can conduce to that main End and Design which they can take and grant without Prejudice to their own Nation and to the main Trade thereof  viz  the  Woollen Manufacture  in some other Branch for to do thus  viz  to yeild what would be fatal to it in another Part would be to build with one Hand and pull down with another  This brings us then to the second Head mention'd above    The settling the Duties upon  French  Goods upon an Equality with the Duties on Goods of the like Nature imported from foreign Countries  This  as is noted above  signifies not at all  as I can understand it  an entire Reduction of our Impost and Customs upon  French  Goods or as the Article at first View seem'd to suggest and as many still understand it to take off all our new Impositions since the Year but rather an Agreement with  France  that as Peace is restor'd between the two Nations and they stand to one another upon an Equality of general Interest in the same relation  of Neighbourhood  one to another so they should  of Trade  also and the Equality of Duties upon Goods of like Sort I laid down as the Foundation of this Equality Those who are of Opinion that an Equality of all Nations in Trade is requisite must produce other Arguments to back that Opinion than I'have seen yet unless by Equalities they will make suitable Allowances for tie different Scituations of Countries Quality of Goods and Circumstances of Trade  Now let others put what Construction they will upon the Ninth Article and upon the Meaning of those Words  the same Duties  and  Goods of like nature  I must be allow'd to think that it is implied that Allowances and Regulations must be made in order to bring the Nature of Things  to be like  and the Duties to  be the same  Things may be said to  be the same  when by just Allowances and Proportions they are regulated and adjusted and brought to an Equality on the contrary tho' the Sum paid upon any Goods  be the same  yet it may give one Side a great Inequality and Advantage over the other and that which is the same thing in the Letter is not the same in the Consequence  These are things cannot be reason'd upon so well before hand as they will be debated and calculated upon a Personal Treaty with Commissioners and therefore I say no Judgment can be made at present by a common Eye But that every Body may judge a little what may be the State of our Trade when this Door of Intercourse and Commerce is open'd it may not be improper to look back and see what the Trade was formerly and to know thereby what we are like to expect when the high Duties are taken off from the  French  Goods here  It is true that Dr  Davenant  in his Report from the Books of the  CustomHouse  to the Commissioners named in the Act for taking examining and stating the Publick Accounts observes that in the Four Years Interval of Peace at the latter End of King  William  we exported to  France  only thus  that is to say  in our  Woollen Manufactures  only              l  s  d  From  Christmas    to  Christmas                          ½                ½                                    The last Year being the Year when the Trade was stop'd by breaking out of the War may pass for nothing and then we see the Export of our  Woollen Manufactures  to  France  appears very  small if the Doctor's Valuation of those Goods are right  On the other Hand in a Representation of Trade and Commerce with  France  made to the late King by his Majesty's Especial Command Dated  December  by the Commissioners of Trade as I have been inform'd there was given in the following terrible Abstract of the  French  Trade with  England viz    In General  That the  French  overballanc'd us in Trade above a Million  per Annum    In Particular  That in One Year the Importations from  France  into  England  only for  Scotland  was not then United  Amounted to    Pou St  Whereas our Exportations to them for the same Year amounted but to    Pou St  Overballance against us    In the same Report it is laid down that the Goods which were Imported from thence Yearly had been Computed thus     l  Wrought Silks  to the Value of    Linnens    Wines  and  Brandy    In all    To descend to farther Particulars They say that in the Year there was Twenty Thousand Tons of  Wine  and Six Thousand Tons of  Brandy  Imported into  England  from  France  and more especially that from  Anno  to there was upwards of the said Quantity of Twenty Thousand Tons of  Wine  and Six Thousand Tons of  Brandy  Imported  It would be Unjust at this time of day to let such Accounts as these lye open for every one to pass their Judgments of without giving the Opinion of him that publishes them because the Reason and Design of the making them publick will very much lye in the giving or not giving that Opinion and therefore I think my self bound to own that I do not look on the said Account to have any Foundation in the Matter of Fact or in the Nature of the Thing And therefore as it does not Comport with the  CustomHouse  Books of those Years so neither does it to me appear Reasonable Howbeit being given in to the late King by such Persons so qualified to know and who were under such Obligations to do it exactly I shall say no more to it but this That no Man need go any farther for a Reason why the late King appear'd very backward after the Peace of  Reswick  to enter upon any Treaty of Commerce with  France  or to open the same by Taking off the said high Duties which at that time and 'till now have been as a Prohibition on both sides  And I cannot wonder why any Man who may have drawn his Calculate of Things from these Estimates should be of the same mind now for certain it is that no Export which we can hope for of our Woollen Manufactures to  France  can ever come up to Balance such an Account as this nay tho' the King of  France  were willing to Take off and Revoke all his Tariffs to and the Tariff of too  On the other hand the  CustomHouse  Books make it appear as is also to be seen in the said Report of Dr  Davenant  that the whole Import of  Wine  and  Brandy  in the Year from  Michaelmass  to  Michaelmass  came out thus  Wine  Tons  Brandy  Tons  Which it seems was plac'd to the Balance of Trade just as the Inclination of the People pleased to lead them Some reckoned it at the Rate or Price which the  Wine  Cost in  France  which I must acknowledge is the true way to state the Balance between the Trade of the Two Kingdoms because in Estimating our Exports to  France  we always reckon the Value of those Exports being of our own Goods at the Worth here and can do no otherwise But others willing to make the Sum appear big Rated or Valued them at the Price  Wine  and  Brandy  was Sold for by the Retailer in  England  In which Valuations the Difference was as follows The first Rated the  Wine  at  l per  Ton and  the  Brandy  at  l per  Ton the other at  l  and  l  By the first the Rate was thus        l  Wine  Tons at  l  is    Brandy  Tons at  l  is            The other thus        l  Wine  Tons at  l  is    Brandy  Tons at  l  is            This makes a manifest Difference and shews that we ought upon very good Examination to take the Calculations of other People in these Cases who always speak as their Party Opinions guide them However take it which way we will it is apparent that after this the Quantity of  Wine  in general Imported from all  France  and from other Countries too increased prodigiously for whereas during the Years and as abovesaid when we Imported Six Thousand Tons of  Wine  and  Brandy  from  France  there was then no Importation at all of  Wine  from  Portugal  or if there was the  CustomHouse  knew it by no other Name than of  Spanish Wines  which might indeed be the Case and those  Spanish Wines  amounted the same Year to Tons So that  the general Import of  Wine  in  England Anno  was Tons the same General Account about the Year or was one Year with another near Tons In Particular thus Entred     Tons  Spain    Portugal    Italy    France    Total    How much of this Wine shall in a future Trade be imported from  France  is hard to determine some alledge the whole Draught of Red Wines will come from thence but this is running too far and too fast for even before the War tho' the Duties of  French  Wines were much lower than the Duties of the  Portugueze  Wines yet there were always great Quantities of  Alicant Florence Bar a Bar  and  Oporto  Wines brought in which by reason of the deepness and brightness of the Colour or Face of the Wines were always found useful by the  Vintners  to draw with their thin meaner  French  Wines and sold at a much greater Price and if as sometimes it happen'd the Vintage in  France  fail'd or the Wines prov'd small and ill colour'd the Quantity and Price of the Wines from  Lisbon Oporto Alicant c  always encreas'd in Proportion  If this was the Case then when the Duties of those other Wines were about  l per  Ton greater than the Duties of the  French  we may reasonably hope it will be still so and with more Advantage to the  Spanish  and  Portugal  Wines when the Duties of the  French  Wines shall be made Equal  But here comes in an Objection which was hinted at before upon the Subject of what you will call Equality  viz  That the  Alicant Florence  and  Lisbon  Wines  c  come in here at a greater Expence both in their first Cost as also in their Freight Cask length of the Voyage  c  than the  French  and thus therefore if the  French  Wines pay but an equal Duty yet the Trade is not thereby put upon an Equality but the Advantage given to the  French  and that a Proportion ought to be stated here to bring this Matter to an Equality  This may have some Weight in it and as I can do no more than mention it here so I cannot prevail upon my self to doubt but the Government will take Care to have the Disproportion consider'd in the further Debates they are to have of that Affair  As to the Treaties with  Portugal  and the Conditions to be perform'd in that part of the Case with the King of  Portugal  they are not for a Subject to dispute but must be left to the Consideration of Parliament to whom it belongs and who no doubt will do what is requisite in that Case  It remains now to examine a little into that part of the Ninth Article which speaks of the  excepted Species of Goods and of appointing Commissaries to regulate the Duties and Differences of those Species according to the Tenor of the other part of the Agreement This is contained in the following words of the Article it self viz  But whereas it is urged on the Part of  France  that certain Merchandizes that is to say Manufactures of Wooll Sugar Salted Fish and the Product of Whales be excepted out of the Rule of the abovementioned Tariff and likewise other Heads of Matters belonging to this Treaty remain which having been proposed on the part of  Great Britain  have not yet been mutually adjusted a Specification of all which is contained in a separate Instrument Subscribed by the Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiaries on both sides It is hereby Provided and Agreed that within two Months from the Exchange of the Ratifications of this Treaty Commissaries on both sides shall meet at  London  to consider of and remove the Difficulties concerning the Merchandizes to be excepted out of the Tariff of the Year and concerning the other Heads which as is abovesaid are not yet wholly adjusted And at the same time the said Commissaries shall likewise endeavour which seems to be very much for the Interest of both Nations to have the Methods of Commerce on one part and of the other more thoroughly examined and to find out and establish just and beneficial means on both sides for removing the Difficulties in this matter and for regulating the Duties mutually But it is always understood and provided that all and singular the Articles of this Treaty do in the mean while remain in their full  force and especially that nothing be deemed under any Pretence whatsoever to hinder the benefit of the General Tariff of the Year from being granted to the Subjects of Her Royal Majesty of  Great Britain  and the said  British  Subjects from having and enjoying the same without any Delay or Tergiversation within the space of two Months after a Law is made in  Great Britain  as abovesaid in as ample manner and form as the Subjects of any Nation the most favoured might have and enjoy the benefit of the aforesaid Tariff any thing to be done or discussed by the said Commissaries to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding  It seems here that the four Species of Goods mentioned  viz Fish  produce of  Whale  that is  Whale Fins  and  Oyl Sugar  Refin'd and  Woollen Maenufactures  shall be excepted out of this Article that is to say out of the Tariff of But what then say we signify all the rest for our Woollen Manufacture is the main thing which we have to insist upon if this should not be adjusted then the whole Trade is gone It is to be hoped that the Wisdom of our Parliament will provide That unless such a Method may be found out that our Manufactures may be admitted into  France  upon such Terms as will make them Vendible there and that they may not only come to Market but may have a Market to come to where they will be Sold they will be very Cautious how they make a Law to Take off our high Duties and Prohibitions upon the  French  Goods for this would  be to Ruin us effectually by admitting  French  Goods of all kinds into  England  and having our Woollen Manufactures in effect prohibited  The great Question then is What is the Tariff of which the Articles make mention of and what is the Difference between that and And to Answer this directly it is to be understood that there is no such thing in  France  as a Tariff of that respects  English  Goods other than that mentioned before made with  Holland  by which the  English  Fine Broad Cloth is Taxed at Livres for Ells  French viz  for about to Yards more than they were Charged before  viz  by the Tariff of and Serges Stuffs  c  in proportion This Addition is the Thing upon which it seems turns the Question between a Trade and no Trade with  France  If this Addition will effect a Prohibition the King of  France  cannot insist upon it when he proposes a Treaty of Trade for that would be to have us open our Trade to him and shut up his Trade from us But if the  French  King is in Earnest to seek a Treaty of Commerce with us then the Difference between the Tariff of and is so little that he cannot scruple to give it up Besides as by the Eighth Article  the Subjects of  Britain  are to enjoy all those Privileges Liberties and Immunities and have the like favour in all things as to all Duties Impositions or Customs whatsoever concerning Persons Goods and Merchandizes which any Foreign Nation the most favour'd enjoys or may hereafter have use and enjoy  If this I say  be agreed then it will remain to enquire How the Treaties of Commerce with the  Dutch  and other Nations have settled this Affair as to Salted Fish and Woollen Manufactures for as to the Produce of Whales it concerns us little who have no Whale Fishing and as to Fish the  Dutch  also are the main Parties concern'd But as to the Woollen Manufacture if the  Dutch  have yielded that Point then we seem to be stop'd by the Eighth Article from asking any more and how far that may consist with the Sale of our Manufactures in  France  remains to be Examined and we may hope will be effectually Debated before it be yielded to  France  The Debate which the respective Commissaries to be appointed are to have as the Article says  for the Interest of both Nations  will no question be very agreeable to all Honest Men if it may be so adjusted as that our Woollen Manufactures may meet with no Interruption in their Exportation to  France  No question there may be such Regulations of Commerce made as may be for the Interest of both Nations but all must be with a supposition of admitting our Manufactures into  France  upon Equal and Reasonable Terms which if it be not done our Trade is rather prohibited than extended rather shut up than opened so that upon this one Article all the rest depends  viz  That the Trade be open'd for our Woollen Goods in  France  How else shall we make our selves amends for the Loss of our Trade in  Portugal  I shall say nothing here to the Obligation upon Her Majesty  to the King of  Portugal  the Government will no doubt concern themselves to preserve the Conditions of every Agreement with the Princes of  Europe  from any Clashing Inconsistencies one with another No more will I undertake to say the  Portugueze  wait to prohibit our Manufactures as soon as they shall hear this Transaction is settled I do not believe the  Portugueze  so weak neither We are told this will be most certain that whatever amends we may make our selves by the  French  Trade we shall certainly lessen our Wine Trade from  Portugal  and to also from  Leghorn  and other parts to whom we at the same time send very large Quantities of our Manufactures and therefore if the Treaty with  France  do not make up the Diminution of those Trades it will not then be an Equivalent to us for the Exchange But we hope the Commissioners who are to meet upon this Subject will concern themselves to weigh this part also and so to admit the  French  Trade that the Trade to  Portugal  may not be in a worse Case than it was before the War Indeed it must be Own'd it would be hard to suggest that the Trade to  Portugal  can be in a worse state than it was before the War when it is known that before the War the whole Duties upon  French  Wines were not more than  l  or thereabout  per Ton  and at the same time the  Portugal  Wines paid above  l    s  Duty And beyond the Years we do not find any Wines imported from  Portugal  at all but under the Title of  Spanish  Wines which may be noted not that there came no Wines from  Portugal  at all but  that  Portugal  was then under the Dominion of the King of  Spain  'till the Revolt of the Duke of  Braganza  the Grandfather of the Present King I say then it can hardly be rational to think the  Portugal  Trade will be quite sunk or that the King of  Portugal  will prohibit Trade with us but that the  French  and  Portugal  Wines paying the same Dutys the first will gain the preference at Market no body will question and therefore it had been to be wished there had been some little reserv'd advantage to the Trade of  Portugal  Wine But since it is otherwise determin'd the  Portugal  Trade must take its Fate and all that remains seems to be the taking a due Care that the Trade to  France  for our Manufactures may be so enlarged as may be a Recompence for what may happen on the other side and if this may but appear we shall have reason to be the better satisfy'd with the Treaty of Commerce and we shall all be glad to find it so that the Complaints of those who pretend to fear nay to know as they say the contrary may appear to have been without ground  The  Silk Manufacture  is next to be considered the  Lustring Company  is now near expiring and their Charter which was granted for  Years is almost run out whether they will obtain a New Charter or no is not for us to enquire whatever we may suppose but whether they shall or not it may be the same thing the Prohibition or Duty equal to a Prohibition upon  Lustrings  and  Alamodes  if it is to remain as by the Equality with other Nations mentioned  in the Treaty it may makes a very great Difference in the Manufacture at home and the Importation from abroad whether the  LustringCompany  can go on or no is for them to determine But it must be own'd that if the Dutys on Foreign  Lustrings  are held up at about  l per Cent  more than the Manufactures of  Lustrings  at home are valued at and the  LustringCompany  cannot go on but the Foreign will outsell them the making them at home must sink under the Imperfections of the Performance rather than under the mistake of the Treaty of Commerce  It is true a Man who has any Value for the Trade of his Native Country cannot but regret the misfortune of the Humour of our People in  Britain  who are so far from Encouraging the Manufactures of their own Country that they will upon all Occasions and almost in all Cases choose any thing to wear that comes from abroad and advance in price for such Goods without regard to the real Goodness or Worth of the thing they buy meerly upon its being Foreign This puts all Manufacturing at least of Silks under very great Discouragements and frequently has defeated the End and Design of many wholesome and good Laws which have been made for the Encouragement of our own People and it is feared this will still be a help to the  French  Interest in Trade when our Duties on their Goods shall be reduced to an Equality with the Goods and Merchandises of other Countries It is true that this is a Mischief that ought if it were possible rather to be punished than  Encouraged but still while this is our Misfortune and we cannot help it the Government may provide as well against it in Treaties and Capitulations as the Nature of such things will admit  How far it can be expected that the Ministers of State should in Treaties of Peace and Commerce allow for these National Follies I will not meddle with here it is most certain that if this Humour of our People prevails after the present Treaty they may defeat the best Designs of the Government in the Treaty and make that mischievous which otherwise would not be so We had an Eminent Example of this Humour of the People in the Extravagance of their Fancy after the  Painted Callicoes  and  Fine Chints  of the  Indies  which run on to so ridiculous an Extreme that on a sudden you saw all the Ladies of Quality and wealthy Citizens Wives dress'd up in a Tawdry piece of  Callicoe  which but a few Years before their ChamberMaids would have thought beneath them to be seen in Nor was this all but immediately by the same Rule our Velvet and Damaskbeds fine Windowcurtains nay the very Hangings of Rooms were all turn'd into  Painted Callicoes  and  Meslepatan Chints  to the entire Destruction if it had gone on of the  Silk Manufacture  and the exceeding Damage of the  Woollen Manufacture  also There was no Remedy for this Distemper  for no doubt it was a Distemper in our People  but to quash it at once by an immediate Prohibition of all  EastIndia Silks  and  Painted Callicoes  and forbidding the wearing and making them up  upon the severest Penalties that could be though  of  I should have observed that as the Humou  for  EastIndia  Goods began at the  Chints  and  Painted Callicoes  so as they began to grow fami+liar the Ladies went on to the  Wrought Silks  o  China  and  Japan  and to wear fine  Atlasses  Rich  Gold  and  Silver Stuffs  and fine  Damasks  and this to that degree that the  Company  Imported Nine Thousand Pieces of Rich  Damasks  in one Ship Nay even in furnishing our Houses the  Indian  Pictures in themselves simple ordinary and ridiculous became more valuable than the Finest Paintings of  Italy  These Things are mentioned here for this reason to note that since our Fancies are thus debauch'd if possible then whatever Treaties of Commerce are made as much Provision ought also to be made as the Nature of the Thing will permit to prevent the ill Consequences of it in our Trade  It is very well known that the like Excess in the Humour and Temper of our People has for many Years past appear'd in their Extravagant Passion for every thing that is  French  as well in Wearing Apparel  Silks  c as in  Wines  and if the Extravagance should now return to possess our Fancy when the  French  Trade opens by this New Treaty we may ruin our own Trade in spight of the best Conditions and Articles in the World As an Exhortation against this Humour in the People would be of greater Use in the main than all possible Exclamation can be against the Treaty so it cannot be offensive to any one  to say that this will necessarily move the Government when they shall treat by the New Commissioners which the Treaty allows that such Dutys may be kept up upon Foreign  Wrought Silks  or added if need be as will give our  English Manufactures  of  Silk  a sufficient preference and cause those People who will still be for  French  Goods to see the Madness and Distraction of their Fancy and how dear they must pay or worse Goods than they may have at home  It cannot be doubted but such Measures would in Time give a shock to the Mischief and perhaps in Time take off our People from the Extravavagance and Folly which has formerly done them so much Harm in Trade and is still so dangerous in the Case before us  The  French  are an Industrious People they work cheap and work well their Fancy in contriving Fashions Figures and Fancies in their Work is very bright and quick and these Things recommend their Goods to us the Vanity and Levity of their Nation prompts them to apply to all the Novelties and Niceties of Dress they gratify the Beaus and the Ladies and this leads us insensibly into the Error and makes our People infinitely fond of their Trade If then the Commissaries who are to meet and regulate the Trade do not state the Duties on  Wrought Silks  c so as to give a very great Difference to the  English Wrought Silk  so as that they may not be discouraged in their Work and the Humour for every thing that is  French  again prevail our HomeTrade will be ruin'd of Course and by its own Friends even the very People who ought to support and carry it on  The present Duties upon  Wrought Silks  to be paid in  Britain  as well from  France  as from other Countries are thus        l  s  d  Alamodes  and  Lustrings  For every lb weight        All other Sorts of  Broad Silks  For every lb weight        These Dutys the  French  may still be obliged to pay because all other Nations pay the same Nay if our Articles are rightly managed and the Parliament thinks fit to lay any other and higher Dutys on the said Species of  Wrought Silks  so be it that other Nations pay the same Dutys upon Goods of the like Nature  It is humbly recommended then to those in whose Hands Power is or shall be lodg'd to do these Things that they would consider the many Thousand Families of our Poor as well  Weavers  as others who depend upon the  Silk Manufactures  in this Nation as also the Great and truly Beneficial Trade to  Turkey  and the  Levant  from whence our  Silk  is chiefly Imported and to purchase which our  Broad Cloth  is sent in such great Quantities as to make a very considerable Figure also in the Employment of our People in the Country all which must sink in a very great Degree if some immediate Care is not taken and Means used to keep up the Value of our own  Broad Silks  and keep down and discourage as much as may be the Importation of  French Silks  upon this New Opening of the Trade  This is the rather urged now because it is evident that there is room very happily made in  the Treaty for it and that at the same time that we apprehend the Danger we yet can with Satisfaction so far Compliment the Makers of this Treaty in that they have left room for so advantageous a Step to be taken in favour of the  Weavers  and  Workers  of  Silk  and that by the Treaty it may be done since as above the  French  scruple not our high Duties at all only desire that they may pay no more than other Nations which if it be Granted them can do us no Harm provided that both they and all other Nations may but be obliged to pay so much that we may be able to go on with our Trade at Home  This is not said by way of Complaint against any thing agreed on in the Treaty The Danger does not seem to be in what is done and Agreed on by the Treaty but from what may yet be done in Consequence of the Treaty and therefore it is that this Case is insisted on  We have seen very large Accounts Published of the Importations of  Foreign Silks  from  France  Dr  Davenant  in his Report to the Commissioners of Accounts says that the Commissioners of Trade in King  William  's Time gave his Majesty an Account that the Importations from  France  to  England  only amounted in Value in this one Article of  Wrought Silks  to  l    Sterling  By a Scheme of the Trade to  France  now Printed and handed about the same is Calculated for the Year  At lb weight of  Wrought Silk  Value  l    per  lb weight is  l    It is noted in the same Scheme that there was recieved at the Port of  Dover  that Year  l  for the Dutys on  French Wrought Silks  besides what may be supposed to be run there that Year  It is not material for us to examine into the Truth of these Accounts Nay tho' they should be allowed to be Fictitious and False as I believe they areBut it will be allowed that the Quantity was very great and it is Humbly Offered to the Consideration of those whom it concerns to weigh from hence How great a Consumption of the  Silk Manufacture  this Nation makes and consequently how well worthy their Concern it is that as much of this as is possible might be manufactur'd by our own Hands and the Trade be kept among our selves  It is true as the Dutys are now  viz    l  for every  l  or  s per  Pound Duty on the said  Wrought Silks  it is a very great Difference but as this comes to be reckoned upon the Measure it does not especially in midling slight  Silks  amount to much by the Yard and suppose it was one Shilling or Two Shillings  per  Yard it is too well known that the Humour of our Ladies when they are buying Fine Cloths and are wheedled with the Opinion of the Fineness and Goodness of  French Silks  is not to be restrain'd by a Shilling Two or Three in a Yard  If then the Duties were enlarged upon the sine Wrought  Silks  to such a Degree that the Weaving of  Broad Silks  and Rich  Brocaded Silks  in  Britain  may not be discouraged such a Treaty of Commerce will be a happy means to prevent  the Ruin of our Trade the starving many Thousands of Poor Familys and the  French  Trade may not be so prejudicial to us in that particular Trade as otherwise there is reason to fear It might be offered at to set down what Addition of Duty would be sufficient to preserve our Trade in this Case but I rather choose to omit that than prescribe to our Legislature The  Weavers  are of Age ask them they are the best Judges  The like Argument and with the same Force will hold good in the  Linnen Manufacture  especially since two great Events both which have happened since the Commencement of the late War  The  Union  with  Scotland  The Prohibiting the Exportation of the  Woollen Manufacture  and the encouraging the making of  Linnen  in  Ireland  Both these Countrys are now employed at least very considerably in  Linnen Manufactures  and it is not to be doubted but that we are and ought to be very justly concern'd for the Encouragement of them both Now if the aforesaid Printed Accounts of Importations from  France  are true for the Year which however I must own I do not Credit yet thus far they serve to argue in this Case that the  Linnen Manufacture  of  France  is very considerable  That Account stands thus  Imported from  France  into  England Anno    Pieces of  Lockram  and  Dowlas  Hundred of  Vitry Canvas  and  Noyals  Hundred of  Ditto Normandy  Pieces of  Quintins  Pieces  Dyed Linnen  Yards  Diaper Tabling  Yards  Ditto Napkining  Pieces  Buckram  Bolts of  Poldavies  Pair of Old  Sheets  It is without any Question that the  Canvas  the  Dowlas  and the  Diaper  may in a little Time come to be all made in  Britain  and  Ireland  the  Diaper  is already improved to such a Degree as nothing can be better And it is Humbly hoped that the Dutys which may be still added upon the  French Linnen  will be such as shall prevent the Discouragement upon these  Manufactures  This we think is the only way to make the Articles of Commerce effectual to the Advantage of  Britain  and to enable us to Trade with  France  for the Future upon as good Terms as we do with other Nations of  Europe
