 COMMONPLACE ARGUMENTS  c  COMMONPLACE ARGUMENTS AGAINST ADMINISTRATION WITH OBVIOUS ANSWERS INTENDED FOR THE USE OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT  LONDON PRINTED FOR R FAULDER NEW BOND STREET M DCC LXXX  ADVERTISEMENT  IN most of the Arts and Sciences Pro∣fessors have formed general outlines of the plan method and arrangement to be followed by the pupils who study them  Some sort of analysis might be of equal service to young proficients in parliamen∣tary eloquenceA multitude of words de∣livered with rapidity and vehemence puzzle and confuse those who are unacquainted with the technical trick of debateIt will be of use therefore to prepare for our juvenile senators a compendious outline  of such arguments as may most probably be employed at the opening of the approach∣ing Session  And in order to detect the fallacy of much popular rhetoric brief observations will be annexed to each of the  Common∣place  topics by which means when any of the old Opposition Orators begin to flou∣rish away on these  trite  arguments the young members may by recurring to the proper section in the Analysis immediate∣ly find most of the  thoughts  and many of the  words  that will be used  for  or  against  the Question with this main difference that each will be much shorter and pro∣bably both more intelligible  The Author is aware that nothing can be simpler than this plan it being much  of the same nature with an  Exhibition Ca∣talogue  which merely describes the sub∣jects of the several compositions presented to public criticism and possibly some read∣ers may think it might have been well to complete the simile by subjoining in this instance as well as in the former the names of the several Artists but though something of that dramatic kind was ra∣ther successfully attempted in a pamphlet called  Anticipation  it seems more adviseable to avoid the least appearance of perso∣nality on the present occasionThe ridicule that was then with some proprie∣ty directed against the tediousness or the pedantry or the droll dotage that charac∣terized some individual speakers would now be wholly unnecessary it never was  a task of difficulty to expose the folly of mock eloquence once atchieved the re∣petition would be as disgustful as the subject  But sophistry assumes new shapes and acts under various disguises like the ma∣licious enchanter in romance to be finally overcome it must be attacked in all its transformations yet he who engages in this war of words can be but little exposed to any charge of presumption it is a com∣bat far more tiresome than perilous and however severely his patience may be exer∣cised he will have but few occasions to ex∣ert his strength so that as his utmost tri∣umph can be only proportionable to so inferi∣or a contest he may be secure at least from the imputation of vanity in undertaking it  CONTENTS  THE late and the new Parliament    Answer    Complimentary Invitations to the young Members    Answer    The Prophecies of

slavish base sordid venal mean inconsistant despicable parliament that ever existedIt betrayed the rights of the people trampled on their privileges violated their majesty servilely crouched to prerogative and wasted the blood and treasure of the public to satiate private ambition and avarice  Hence national resentment was universally rouzed the elective body to a man despi∣sed the representative and all ranks and orders of people anxiously expected the happy mo∣ment of the dissolution At the approach indeed of that awful crisis political frailty felt a sort of deathbed penitence it was the hectic virtue of a moment the panic however soon subsided and flushed with new hopes of a protracted existence the old septennial methodist rose like Voltaire from sickness impatient for deeper vices and anxious for more aggravated profli∣gacy  "Such  was  your parliamentLook you now what follows"A young phoenix rising from the ashes of the oldthe best of all possible parliamentsa pure un∣corrupt delegation from the true source of all real power the people unfettered by connections unclogged with errors free to consult to deliberate to determine for the public safety "Such  is  your par∣liament"  ANSWER  IT is difficult to give a just idea of the a∣nimated stile of opposition invectives particularly on such a theme as the present where the free indulgence of them is un∣checked by any of those awkward restraints which some young men have of late so un∣constitutionally thrown on themA de∣ceased parliament is one of those  immaterial  objects that every one may attack with perfect impunity and indeed under the present restrictions it is no small conveni∣ence to the component parts of such a cor∣porate body to have in the very nature of their constitution a safe resource for the exercise of their wildest rancour and most fanciful asperity It is however uncom∣monly whimsical that almost the very same set of men who actually composed the subject of this invective should be themselves the auditors of it and at the same moment that they are stigmatized in  their late capacity they should receive so premature a panegyric in their new one yet such is almost precisely the case  The last parliament and the present par∣liament being very nearly one and the sameIt is true indeed there have been some exchanges and different branches of par∣ticular families have taken their rotation in election honours but  still  both parliaments are  essentially  and  effectually  alike so that with a few inconsiderable exceptions the returns and reelections incontrovertibly prove that all the imputations of national odium and contempt so industriously thrown on the last parliament must at least have been grossly exaggerated if not entirely false  As to the  penitential vote  so often and so vauntingly relied on it will always be re∣membered that the House  at large  refu∣sed to  report  the  abstract proposition  so fear∣fully passed by a committee of inferior  numbersIt was indeed a florid weakness the hectic effort of exhausted sedition that "Like the faint offer of a latter spring served but to usher in the fall and withered in an affected bloom"  COMPLIMENTARY INVITATIONS TO BE SCATTERED AMONG THE YOUNG MEMBERS  AS it is scarcely possible that any gen∣tleman of spirit or independence can support the ministry without forfeiting all pretensions to virtue justice honor and common sense there can be still less doubt that those who are least hackneyed in the ways of public life and consequently most accutely sensible of the allurements of popularity will instantly join the present constitutional upright consistent generous just opposition  What can be so flattering to youthful am∣bition as being immediately enrolled in a band of genuine patriots and registered among the only British worthies of the age what ampler field can the world afford for the display of genius learning and elo∣quence than that glorious contest of  Ameri∣ca  with  England  of freedom against tyran∣ny  In the most prosperous times the  support  of ministers is an inglorious and vulgar task compared to the  control  of them There is little or no scope for rhetoric in plain state∣ments regular calculations legal precision and such other trite and plain modes as men in office  must  necessarily pursue On the contrary  opposition  has inexhaustible themes of eloquencesuspicions alarms menaces and predictions not to mention impeachments which cannot well recur so regularly are rich and constant sources of popular declamation Besides one of the chief benefits that arise from new parlia∣ments is the accession of fresh supplies of genius and cultivated abilities And perhaps there never was a time when such immense quantities of both were introduced into the House of Commons as upon the present oc∣casionyoung gentlemen not only endow∣ed with prodigious abilities but who have been for many years back in  training  for debate abound on all sidesWhat an in∣finite pity would it be then were such im∣proved talents obscured and shrowded from public admiration in the dull details of of∣ficial  politiciansIn the moment of peril and dismay it is happy for this nation at large to have selected men formed as it were for the salvation of their countryIt is no less fortunate for those who possess such talents to have them called into ac∣tion at so aweful a crisisIndeed it is one of the great benefits arising from the present calamities that gentlemen have now much finer opportunities and more numerous subjects for displaying their talents than they could possibly have enjoyed in more quiet times and which too if not imme∣diately taken advantage of may irretrievably escape by some unlucky change to prospe∣rity abroad or humanity at home  ANSWER  WHAT antidote can reason provide against such potent incantationsThe cold suggestion of more temperate ad∣vice would feebly resist the Syren voice of popular allurement and vainly is judgment addressed where the subtle appeal is more fancifully made to vanity and inexperience To examine and analize the several properties of real  debate  in distinction to those of wild  declamation  would appear too refined to ridicule the prevailing passion for oratory too trite still less would it be proper under this division either to enquire into the merits of Minority or to discuss the justice and sincerity of their claims to public confidence  To raise  new levies  for the service of Opposition is so entirely the  interest  of that set of men who command the  old troops  that it cannot fail to create some flight doubts of the perfect sincerity and pure zeal of their  complimentary invitations But without considering such an adventurous junction in the more serious light of a desertion from every solid and substantial interest of our country it may not be wholly unuseful to suggest how impossible it is for the Opposi∣tion in its present state to afford those nu∣merous and happy occasions for the display of genius and eloquence which its advocates so speciously hold out as the strongest incen∣tives to youthful ambition  The  Minority  has long been directed and controuled by a few leading orators who after years of fatiguing service are most justly entitled to rank as veterans in their pro∣fession and are now too reasonably jealous of their established precedence to participate in fame with the raw recruits they are so anxious to enlistOne of their leaders has expressly published  the Articles of Party  with much fairness and candour avowing the necessity of obedience to a common leader and of acting in due subordination to his commands With more zeal indeed  than policy this champion of party very frankly decried and ridiculed all separate ex∣ertions and individual efforts as attempts of equal inefficacy and presumption and ra∣ther rashly discovered so much more of this degrading system than former politicians had thought it wise or decent to reveal that many men of proper pride and spirit were disgusted with the  Rockingham service  and beg'd leave to  resign their commissions  Others of subtler talents laboured with more art and casuistry to explain away these dangerous  articles  but still however speciously they argued they always had the precaution to maintain their rank in eloquence by the ex∣clusion of every new competitor and to se∣cure the  credit  by monopolizing the  time  of debate  No young man of talents has for years back met with the patronage of Opposition every succeeding session was the echo of the former the same quantity of time has been annually devoted to the same tediousness and protraction of debate even stated hours seemed almost appointed for each particular  orator nor was it ever a very difficult cal∣culation to imagine who was actually speak∣ing at any given time by only looking what o'clock it was for the daily movements of their rhetoric were as mechanically exhi∣bited by a periodical succession of figures as those of the famous  Strasburg clock  ex∣cept indeed when some rough unmanage∣able countrygentlemen  would  start out like the savages of St Dunstan's to give a hasty stroke or two and then retire again to rest in peace on their unpolished clubs  But above all the particular stile of abi∣lities which characterize the present ma∣nager of Opposition renders all inferior ex∣ertions in eloquence almost useless and ri∣diculousThere is a magnitude in extraor∣dinary talents that contrasts and caricatures the comparative inequality of those who are placed in competition with them Qualities which carried to an extreme are striking from their enormity such as desperate ve∣hemence and outrageous acrimony become ridiculous in imitation and impotent by in∣feriority They resemble theatrical thunder  compared with real and serve only to bur∣lesque an original that can never be success∣fully imitated The minor malcontents and mimic republicans of the present day would do well therefore to reflect how very contemptible the petty partizans of faction have been in all ages and countries There were dozens of duodecimo Catilines who buzzed conspiracy in every corner of the Forum though history has scarcely stooped to name them Ravaillac had his  monk committees  and  holy associations  whose  debates  and  resolutions  have been charitably consigned to oblivion nor has there ever been any desperate leader from the rank of  Catiline  to  Cade  who has not boasted a gang of followers  officious  and  obscure busy  and  forgot  PROPHECIES OF OPPOSITION  IN stating contingent events and deducing the future consequences of any mea∣sure now in agitation Opposition should al∣ways be deemed infallibleThey are intitled to this dependance on their  present  predic∣tions because all their  former  prophecies are fully accomplishedLest a point of such consequence to their credit should have remained unrecorded a copious list of these divinations was published in a periodical pa∣per devoted to their service and to au∣thenticate more indubitably the evidence of this political foresight any gentleman who will be so obliging as to refer to the list will find the date of each prediction accurately subjoined the place of utterance in a mar∣ginal note and the full accomplishment in the opposite column It will be equally ap∣parent that the ministry in several in∣stances received and treated these pro∣phecies with most irreverent scepticism with great justice and propriety therefore  no circumstance is more perpetually and more successfully urged than the  Prophe∣cies of Opposition  and hence it is most fairly inferred that their  past  sagacity invests them with an indefeasible and perpetual in∣fallibility  in future  ANSWER  THE gipsey Fortuneteller  "takes a bond of Fate"  and to ensure her skill most generally  perpetrates  the mischiefs she predictsTo this judicious policy it may be chiefly owing that Egyptian divina∣tion has so long surviv'd all other oracles and supernatural inspirations of antiquityThe Pythian priestess became suspected or un∣intelligible from evasion or ambiguity and was equally stigmatised by Philip's gold or the chains of CraesusEven our homespun witches  "palter'd in such double sense"  that by their own equivocation more than any terrors of law they forfeited the credulous veneration they had so long usurpedIn short the gipsey pursues the best sys∣tem for all human prophecies This en∣suring Sybil boldly corrects the uncertainty of time and chance and with great pru∣dence relies on her own dexterity for the securest voucher of her prescience  A similar wisdom has guided the  pro∣phets of Opposition  I pledge myself to this House says one of them that the confidence which Ame∣rica may justly repose in the sympathetic ardor that inspires a very great part of this nation will make her scorn your menaces and fly to arms to vindicate her rights  Here is one instance among a thousand o∣thers of a patriotic prediction that by the liberal encouragement it holds out goes great lengths to effect the event it foretells and is in fact the leading cause of its own ac∣complishment  Away with the idle notion says another prophet of success in your Northern expedition I am bold to say and I wish my words to be taken down that miscarriage and ruin will at∣tend that devoted army  Not to com∣ment too harshly on the very extraordinary precision and accuracy of these terms it is fair to observe thus much on all predictions of this nature That they act with a double influence first by dispiriting our friends and then by encouraging the enemy conse∣quently  if they are not condemned as  prin∣cipals  they may at least be arraigned as active  accomplices  in producing the calamity they foretell  But as many people have thought that too large a portion of debate has been em∣ployed of late years in recounting the utte∣rance and expounding the final completion of these prophecies it might tend to ab∣breviate this article of oratory if a commit∣tee of parliamentary prophets invested with the ensigns of augural authority were or∣dered forth with to  prepare  and  bring in  a kind of  Political Almanack  or  Patriots Ca∣lender  for the use of the current year where∣in all minor victories and defeats should be set down as feasts and fasts and redletter days set apart for more important losses  It might enrich a work of this nature to interleave each month with pages of collate∣ral philosophy opposite to its subjects such as refutations of several vulgar errors too com∣monly enterained relative to some military  misdeeds in the late campaigns by com∣paring them to the retrogade motion of the planets which every more enlightened ob∣server can easily prove to be quite contrary to appearances and merely arising from our vast distance from the objects and the gross medium through which we view them so too any tediousness in crossing the  Dela∣ware  or obscurity in the  Saratoga  business might receive great light from the philoso∣phy of  transits  and  eclipses  while the doc∣trine of Comets would furnish infinite ana∣logy to all kinds of excentricity civil mili∣tary or naval  These together with proper tables for calculating the influence of the moon on the rise and fall of stocks would form a very compendious and handy diary in stateaffairs and in a short time must become as infal∣lible a guide in politics as  Partridge  's  pre∣dictions  formerly were in astrology  ANNUAL PARLIAMENTS  IN the moment of most general danger to the very existence of a state from a rebellion and a foreign war it becomes all wise good and prudent men to devote their whole time to the concerting measures not to overcome the common enemy but to new model and patch up the constitution just as in a closely besieged town every clever fellow should leave it to his inferiors to repell the assailants from the walls and busy himself and his neighbours in drawing plans to repair and beautify the old townhall the assemblyrooms and other build∣ings of the city And this not from any paradoxical confusion or ideal refinement that the  inside  of the town is to all intents and purposes the  outside  or that the said edifices are  virtually  the fortifications but for a much simpler and more substantial reason namely that the day of distress and danger is the true time to frighten the magistrates into receiving their terms which if the  siege is raised will set them up for ever in fame and fortune and if it be not will serve at least to recommend them to the victorious enemy as very shrewd and nota∣ble projectors  Now in a state like ours it is clear that the constitution of parliament must always form the grand subject of political theory Hence various schemes have been propound∣ed to purify and refine it from all corrup∣tions and many tedious preparations in the nature of chymical processes have been occasionally invented to exalt it to what it really should be a kind of compound elixir of popular spirit  In the course of these experiments some professors insisted that its whole efficacy must depend on the ingredients that com∣pose it being brought from their several native soils free of all chargesOthers held that larger quantities of its most wholesome  simples  should be gathered out of the rich∣est and best cultivated lands and not pick∣ed up like mushrooms from old wastes  and barren commons But however com∣posed sifted and refined several concurred in opinion that it  never  could keep its spirit above  three  years because formerly they only made it up for that time  But the last and far most important dis∣covery of all is that it never possibly can be fit for use or good for any thing at all above a  twelvemonth  after it is first put to∣getherOr to release the metaphor be∣fore it's quite exhausted that annual parlia∣ments are the grand arcanum and sovereign panacea for all the distempers of our de∣cayed and perishing constitution And in order to establish this important point first they affirm that the virtue of that restricted duration beyond a triennial one is very clearly proved by a converse ratio of the old homely adage  "There can never be too much of a good thing"  which being inverted very fairly carries the question  by three to one  against triennial in favour of annual parliamentsAnd next the ingenious ad∣vocates of this improvement as clearly prove the undoubted  use  and  pleasure  that would  naturally result both to constituents and re∣presentatives from this annual revolution of intercourse by shewing how infallibly it must promote the health and spirits of the former to be under a sort of pleasing ne∣cessity to keep up a visiting acquaintance with their constituents in the purer air of the country to whom in  their  turn it would prove equally beneficial and delightful by encouraging the briskness of trade and cheapness of provisions at such constant re∣petitions of election festivity and convi∣vial fellowshipBut these and many se∣condary motives are lost in the beauty depth and curiosity of the main argument that is the foundation of this plan which is briefly this The mysterious excellence of the number TWELVE that limits the months in this constitutional period a cabalistical idea which tho' too subtle and complex to be dwelt on minutely in this place can∣not fail to strike every impartial mind with sufficient force on the mere mention of a few instances among the millions which exist wherein this number of TWELVE pre∣dominates  with which short enumeration the subject shall be closed  First then all the world knows that the earth revolves in  twelve  months round the  twelve  signs of the Zodiac and this too as Monsieur Gebelin very critically expounds was typically illustrated in Pagan mytholo∣gy by the  twelve  labours of Hercules all which like our corporate and parochial of∣fices were performed exactly in the good even space of a  twelvemonth  Next all petty juries are composed of  twelve  and grand ju∣ries of twice  twelve  good men and true so too there are  twelve  judges and tho' the bishops exclusive of the two metropolitans are just twice that number yet there is a relative proportion even in this difference which was certainly designed to signify the double glory of ecclesiastical united with tem∣poral dignities as well as the exact increase of piety in these latter compared to the pri∣mitive times when in truth as every one knows there were but  twelve  apostlesAdd to these therefore the  twelve candlesticks  in the revelations the  twelve  tribes of Israel the  twelve  Caesars and dozens of other duo∣decimo examples and you will then have the very essence of all the arguments in fa∣vour of parliaments for  twelve months  ANSWER  PREVIOUS QUESTION  BEST OFFICERS  DRIVEN  FROM THE SERVICE  MINISTERS have the art to con∣nect contrarieties of baseness they dismiss without cause or employ to no end our best officersExamples of the former have appeared in the militia the latter has been equally instanced both in our army and navyThere is something of Pagan craft in this crooked policyThe virtue and valour of  Theseus  were too formidable to a feeble and suspicious tyrant to be overlooked with affected contempt or openly degraded it was a safer and subtler cruelty to exhaust this dangerous heroism in remote and pe∣rilous enterprizes which if atchieved would give credit to the wisdom of those who  projected  them but if attended with shame and disappointment might lower if not entirely destroy the reputation of their conductors  The hero of antiquity indeed defeated this pernicious system and returned in tri∣umph to greet his insidious employers with unwelcome successes and offensive victory But however fatally imperfect the parallel of devoted valour must appear in modern annals every generous mind will equally abhor the same base and mean policy which in both instances veiled ruin beneath its bounty and exalted only to destroy  Such has been the odious system of go∣vernment towards those whose professional eminence joined to their popular attach∣ments and connections pointed them out as the fittest objects for temporary banish∣ment at least if not shameful captivity abroad or more degrading impotence at home  Nor has the executive power been less busily oppressive in the domestic arrange∣ments of our great internal and constituti∣onal defence the militiaIt is the extreme of tyranny to controul the freedom of thoughtSidney lost his life for his  written  principlesWith more cautious injustice the patriots of the present day are deprived of their hereditary honours for daring to  speak  their independent opinionsTo re∣lease the mind from the oppressive awe of of authority the patriotic parliament of Charles the First's reign claimed and ex∣ercised their just right of appointing the Lord Lieutenants and other officers that array and command our militiaIt was too well foreseen that a right of so extensive a nature might in the hands of regal ca∣price become a convenient instrument to check the spirit of liberty or to  punish  its  generous exertions  Could it have been imagined that the time would arrive when the highest and most important ranks of that very armament should be rashly in∣vaded and revengefully violated by prero∣gative if on any occasion their established possessors dared to exercise the right of thinking for themselves it might have damped the zeal of precipitate loyalty in re∣signing so important a right to the discre∣tion and virtue of a monarch Unfortu∣nately however this very right was as rashly  surrendered by the parliament of Charles the Second as it was manfully maintained in the reign of his tyrannical predecessor  What has been the consequenceWe have lived to see the day when a ruinous and wretched administration that administration which has invariably pursued the wicked system of division that administration which has set friend against friend relation against relation and connection against con∣nection that administration which has robbed us of thirteen colonies and plunged us in a shameful and calamitous war with the whole world has insolently dismissed the accomplished descendants of two of the noblest and most ancient families from those commands to which their superior rank and property had most justly elevated their ancestors and themselves for on∣ly happening to vote in opposition to the minister of the day  ANSWER  THERE is but little necessity to con∣sider the fabulous allusions and ideal parallels of declamation The legendary tale of Demagogues had its use in the de∣cline of Athenian freedom but if its boasted hero had surrendered to his worst and basest antagonist without fighting and in a short time after some happier hero had fought and conquered the very same combatant probably no Grecian orator would after∣wards have much insisted on the visionary speculation of an army's being devoted to sacrifice an individual  It is necessary to treat the latter part of this argument with some degree of serious∣ness and solidity Least however too much time may appear to be wasted on it it may be prudent to premise that objections founded on popular notions and prejudices are easily conveyed in few words and so  conveyed make strong impressions but whoever  answers  those objections must en∣counter all the notions to which they are allied and to which they owe their strength and it is well if any words find admittance to remove the first impression  The appointment of party men to places of trust and power was indeed a very ha∣zardous policy it must however be re∣membered that this  policy  was founded on a very liberal and generous hope that how∣ever the forms of opposition might be kept up and even the technical licentiousness of debate persevered in yet that every man of honor at so awful a period would divest himself of all the little prejudices and pas∣sions of party and feel his mind actua∣ted by the noblest impulse to suspend at least all private resentment if not to form a truly glorious coalition founded on public principle and national honorCertain∣ly the accomplishment of so noble a pur∣pose would have been crowned with far different success from that which has ac∣tually attended its attempt  But to avoid these painful and vain re∣flections in proceeding to answer the charge of  violent and unconstitutional dismission  it must first be remembered that  removals  are not  punishments  It would be absurd to imagine that a meer private prejudice in political measures however vague and fanci∣full or even pernicious in its tendency to the general welfare of the state can become an object of  penalty  But it is indeed a very different question with what propriety those persons who not only avow such opinions with the fond attachment of innovation but also disseminate them with most active zeal should be continued in those very stations which afford most frequent and most exten∣sive opportunities to spread them with all the weight of influence and authorityAnd next as to the  right  of dismission it is ob∣vious that the same power which  appoints  to offices must necessarily  remove  from them both are exercises of that plain discretionary trust necessarily reposed in all governments to the end that every delegation of their au∣thority may be lodged in such hands as shall seem best affected to those who employ  themNor is this  preventive policy  of guarding against dissaffecton less congenial with the  spirit  of our constitutionThe prerogative of appointment to offices was originally unlimited but at the Restoration the parliament most expressly declared the necessity of guarding with jealous vigilance against the introduction of those persons into places of  power  and  trust  whose opinions and prejudices rendered them dangerous ser∣vants for the state to employ  Hence the  corporation  and  test acts  which tho' at first they may seem rather formed to guard the mitre than the crown were in fact more really directed against the  civil  than the  religious  principles of the dis∣senters  These disabling statutes very clearly prove two points both of which are material to this question  First that it is perfectly constitutional to exercise the prerogative of appointment to  offices with a strict and cautious attention to the principles of those who are to be em∣ployed in them and next that in every other instance except in these statutable disquali∣fications this prerogative is entirely unlimi∣ted and absolutely discretionary for it is plain that the very restriction in those ex∣cepted cases virtually establishes its inde∣pendance in every other But so anxious were the restoration parliament to remove all possibility of any future encroachment on the discretionary prerogative of militia ap∣pointments that an act was unanimously passed expressive of the national abhorrence of that recent usurpation of them which had fatally given arms to innovation and over∣turned the constitution under the specious pretence of amending it  By the same act also it was directly decla∣red that those very appointments had ever been and for ever should continue the unali∣enable and uncontrouled right of the crown  Such then being both the  letter  and the  spirit  of the law on this point it is but mere  matter of curiosity to consider the plain principles on which this power is founded both in  natural  and  civil  society  In the former tho' all men were origi∣nally on an equality yet the distinction of abilities set the first boundsIt required wisdom and courage for council and armsand it was necessary of course to exclude from each such as were respectively defi∣cient in either  So far forth therefore there was a  natural  limitationBut in  civil  society it is equally important in all delegations of power to connect affection to the government with the other leading qualifications for as has been too often proved a courageous man who hates his employers is at least as unfit to be trusted as a coward and wisdom connected with enmity would only serve to aggravate treachery in councilThe plain consequence of which is this that either no government has a right to preserve itself against the disaffection of a subject or  else that every government has a right to ex∣clude from offfices of power and trust such as render themselves suspected of disaffec∣tion  OPINION OF THINGS IN GENERAL OR CONVERSATION POLITICS  EVERY thing is as bad as bad can beIndeed it's now my only comfort that  any  change must be for the betterIt can't be for the worseAs to America the game is upIt was always a mad visionary scheme without an object or an endPoor Sir Robert Walpole who after all was a very great man used always to say "He would never set that stone a rolling"France is amazingly populousIt's nonsence to talk of a rebellion in South AmericaSpain has all that immense wealth under her thumbSo we are to fight them and all the world for what I see  And howWe have no men at homeAnd how are we to get themI'm sure we have no money  Formerly we had friends abroad to apply toThe old king of Prussia for oneBut surely we can't go on as we have year after year with loan upon loan and tax upon taxWhy if a gentleman's going post now he can't sleep in peace in his chaiseHe's sure to be woke by the turn∣pike man hollowing for the new tickets indeedWhat will they tax nextNot air I hopeThen there are these nor∣thern powerI  don't  know what they meanI repeat it I haven't an idea what they would be atLet me tell you it's a very black cloud hovering over us and bodes  no good  Why don't we employ new menWe want some great original genius like a Cha∣tham to come forward and  act  Then we should get onWe don't get onSuch a monstrous fleet as ours should have push'd into Brest water at onceor bombarded CadizWhy did not they convoy all the ships we have lostAll I see that they are ever about is victuallingThey are tak∣ing

bottom of those capturesPeople shake their heads in the cityDepend on it there has always been an overruling influence in the cabinetA'nt every thing given to ScotchmenWe should set the axe to the rootIn short I fairly own things are come to such a pass thatI really don't know what to advise  EQUIVOCAL ANSWER BY A TRIMMER  COME come my dear sir now you go too farAs long as you confined yourself to wit and humour it was all very fairbut don't be too severeNot that I absolutely differ from you in what you assert for I have by no means made up my mind on  any  of these mattersI own I wish to see a little more what turn things may take before  I  declare myselfThis country has certainly very great re∣sourcesBut at the same time we are in a mighty hazardous wayYet America is a great gameHeaven only knows tho' what should be doneIt is very true I  have  mostly voted with ministryIndeed I  did  live in habits with a good many of themBut I never will  commit myself  to any set of menI own I always thought the lessen∣ing the burthens of the landed interest a  very fine objectAnd to be sure it  was  my opinion that our colonies should bear a part in redeeming the debts we incurred for their defenceBut I don't know that  every  thing has been carried on right in AmericaYet I don't throw blame any whereThough there may have been faultson both sidesHowever we shall seeI must talk with ministers about these thingsBut thus much I will sayI don't at all disapprove of the conduct of the States General nor indeed of any of the northern powers for they act only with proper precaution and it's quite right for nations as well as individuals to be on their guard and take care of themselves  THE PRAISE OF PARTY  INdependance is a wild unsocial ideaeven a monk confessed that to abso∣lutely enjoy this mental solitude man must change his nature to that of angels or de∣mons  In the progress of civilization every ap∣proach to perfection is founded on relin∣quishing this solitary pride of thinking or acting for ourselves aloneThe rudest sa∣vages have their clans and chiefs the freest republics their heads and statholders  From different degrees of strength cou∣rage or abilities subordination arisesTo the boldest or hardiest or wisest the su∣preme command in war or in peace is con∣fidedand the natural equality of each is prudently resigned for the benefit of allbut chiefly on the spur of necessity and the  pressure of complex operations is the en∣crease of dependance originally grounded and ultimately establishedThe former  cre∣atea  Roman dictatorship by the latter it was  perpetuated  Thus then as it appears that all natural independance has been exchanged as the bar∣ter for social happiness so it is equally evi∣dent that in the perfection of a civil state combinations and confederacies must be en∣couraged and perfected and finally that in the conflict of opposite contentions the decisive weight and efficient force of party must depend on its disciplin'd submission to the controul of one common leader  Nor let it be objected that the avowed ho∣stilities of party may in the present times provoke a closer union of  ministerialists  than might otherwise subsist among so divided a bodyIt is true indeed there is a gloomy cloud of discord and dissention that over∣spreads those common foes of Opposition and of their countryAuspicious may it prove and happy be the presage of their  dispersion and their ruinBut let it not inspire a sanguine and premature confidence which by relaxing the ardour of pursuit may in the end defeat our hopes and rob us of the glorious object of all our toilsBesides at this crisis there are those who are yet free to choose their political lineAnd if properly incited what doubt can long remain in favour of which they will decideIs not the support of ministry but another term for meanness and venality Are not Opposition and party the very echoes of virtue and genius The former is indeed a phalanx of basenessthe latter the sacred league of wisdom and of honourIf then the lists of parliamentary fame must be martialed for the combat who is there can a moment hesitate what arms to wield whence the champion should begin his bold career or what is the enterprize his courage should atchieve to win the immor∣tal guerdon of renown  Minions of power your's be the inglo∣rious task in tinsel pomp and flimsey  pride to wave your silken banners in the sunshine of a courtly pageant  Labour and vigilance and patience are the badge of all the patriot tribeBut re∣putation is the palmand if they perish in the cause of liberty welcome be the stroke that consecrates their doom with more than martyr's glory and transmits their fame from age to age with undiminished ho∣nour  ANSWER  THOUGH nothing is more certain than that public spirit is equally abhor∣rent from credulous adherence or coward∣ly indecision yet to define the precise limits of either extreme would be to renew the  commonest  of all  commonplace  theoriesIt may be more useful to state a few points admitted by the disputants on both sidesIt is allowed then that fixed principles and general maxims should be the established guides of all bodies of men whose office it is to act together  This conformity is restricted however to opinions tho' it naturally inclines to a con∣sistence in public conductBut leagues and confederacies founded on private attach∣ments only lead to mean and degrading subservience for more personal  association  is little better than conspiracyHence to de∣sire a body of English gentlemen who are chosen by the nation to consult deliberate  and then determine to herd at once under any individual leader and follow wherever he calls is equally absurd and insolent  It must be repeated however that estab∣lished principles and unequivocal maxims are great and proper guidesTo act consist∣ently with  them  is sense and honourHow contradictory to this system are the language and the conduct of Opposition"I boast myself a partyman and therefore will op∣pose the minister" are the very words per∣petually repeated in the House of Commons by the greatest advocates of minorityThus the badge and livery of faction are ostenta∣tiously displayed on  one  side of the houseOn the opposite ask one of the  equivocal poli∣ticians  how he means to act and he will answer you and with perfect honor that "he is no partyman but will freely tell you his general principles and avow his former line of conduct"And so far forth he acts up to the spirit of the constitutionBut if afterwards his conduct is a desertion of those principles and totally inconsistent with what he himself declares it to have for∣merly  been if in short it is evasive shuf∣fling and mean if he hangs aloof in the lobby takes an impartial dinner in the ad∣joining coffeehouses or happens unluckily to be called out on very particular business just before the division and then  sails  up and down the passages  cruises  in the com∣mitteerooms  bears away  for the court of requests or  steers  directly home in his coach  with his light out  then indeed the previous acknowledgment of his former principles and conduct is equally useless and ridiculous and he must be content to rank in future with those homehollanders or domestic dutchmen whose cold ungrateful caution and  armed neutrality  is nearly as pernicious and far more despicable than the bolder hostilities of open enmity  THE LAST CAMPAIGN AND GENERAL STATE OF THE NATION  AFTER the ruinous experience of a ten year's war the moment is arrived when a New Parliament are to deliberate and determine on the expedi∣ency of prosecuting or relinquishing of accomplishing or abandoning American subjugationLet the Last Campaign and the present State of the Nation be the fair and substantial grounds of argument to decide upon this extensive and import∣ant question  First then As to the Latte Campaign it is apparent to the whole world that the daring spirit of enterprize which once distinguished the councils and elevated the valour of this country above her an∣cient  enemies is now fatally changed to cold and ignominious caution to narrow and temporary prudenceIt is no longer conquest or death It is lingering shame and protracted disgraceThat fleet which once commanded the homage of nations is become now the object of pity or contemptThose arms that for ages snatched uncertainty from For∣tune are at length the splendid pageant of defensive pride and wasteful inactivityOn the contrary what is the situation of our enemies in both these respectsTo the accident of an epidemical disease alone it is owing that Count D'Estaign at the head of the combined fleets did not drive us from the ChannelYet the moment he had steered from Spain by the ignorance and folly of our Admiralty and the mise∣rable meanness of the convoys two of the most valuable fleets that ever sailed from this country were instantly captur'd to the aggrandizement and glory of our ene∣mies to the disgrace and ruin of ourselvesIn the West Indies such is the decided  superiority of the French and Spaniards that it may be boldly predicted Jamaica must im∣mediately be the victim of Spanish avarice and Halifax become the support and re∣source of the ambition of France Nor have their arms been less successful by land Monsieur de Ternay is in complete posses∣sion of Rhode Island an acquisition in itself fatally accommodated to impede every enterprize of England but still more ru∣inous by facilitating and hastening the en∣tire loss of CanadaUnlike the slight and single advantage which has been dearly ac∣quired by  our  army and which indeed will too probably become more ruinous to this country that its fatal surrender or cap∣tivity could possibly have proved by madly encouraging the further prosecution of destructive temerity and by deluding the giddy unthinking multitude to a longer endurance of this accursed war  Such being the comparative state of the last campaign let us in the next place con∣sider the situation of continental politics  Commodore Johnstone has been driven from PortugalThat nation is crouching to SpainThere is an officer in the House of Commons who may be appealed to to tell his experience of the duplicity and meanness of PortugalIndeed the con∣duct of Portugal is now but a proper return for our additional impositions on her trade as well as the unparallel'd audacity of seiz∣ing American vessels laden with her pro∣duceIt is a similar perfidy that has pro∣voked the resentment of all the nothern na∣tionsThe Portuguese are not more our enemies than the Russians the Swedes the Danes and the DutchTurks Jews and Infidels conspire to drive us from the MediteraneanWith our trade our pos∣sessions also in those seas must inevitably perishMinorca cannot long escape Gi∣braltar was saved last year by an experi∣ment and preserved only by the indolence of SpainA ridiculous embassy indeed has been secretly undertaken and the literary  West Indian  translated to  the Spanish Fryer  But while political credulity consults its  Delphic  Oracle or weakly trusts the vision∣ary hope of a congenial rebellion in South America our vigilant and determined ene∣mies are somewhat more seriously employ∣edFrance has sent troops to Holland and the Dutch must be compelled to go to war with usIn short the whole conti∣nent of Europe is united in one common and equal league against this devoted coun∣try  To oppose so powerful a confederacy what are our resourcesThere are none that the ablest financier could invent suffi∣cient to contend with the whole world But the nation is already exhausted and ruinedThe spirit of commerce is for ever annihilated by our recent irrepara∣ble calamities nor can the most adventur∣ing industry any longer confide in the des∣picable conductors of our naval strength to hazard any new enterprizeBut sup∣posing the possibility that added burthens of imposts and taxes could be explored what  force  have we to oppose the matchless  superiority of our enemiesYoung un∣disciplined regiments must be sent to bane∣ful climates while our old establishments are confined at home and excellent officers are either necessarily detained with them or insolently superseded by adventurers without a claim or pretension to so dan∣gerous an innovation  And this too while the Commander in Chief in America calls for new supplies of men which it is impossible to provide and yet without which those already there must be totally ineffectualSuch is our mi∣serable inability in arms resources officers and men to continue this ruinous de∣structive desolating war against America against the world  What is our situation at homeA set∣tled gloom of discontentThe petitions of the people for a while gave place to more immediate and pressing objectsBut let not the authors of national ruin exult in secure tranquillityThe momentary calm may yet be succeeded by tempests that shall  overwhelm them in misery and destruc∣tionAnd if the most shameless corruption if an accumulation of injuries and insults can awaken us to a just feeling of our wrongs it will be easy to discover and meritorious to employ the most  effectual  means of redressing themEvery lenient and peaceable method has long been pur∣sued in vainAuthority has been intreated with submission haughtiness has been soothed with humility profligacy has been tempted to reformation by allurement of pardon and even by the prospect of praiseThat weight and authority which from the chair of office turned the scale of debate and with liberal and disinterested magnanimity supported the petitions will now be exerted though not with equal dignity yet with superior force to give  effect  to those principles which it so libe∣rally avowed  Our only remaining hope is in the uni∣on of disinterested and independent spirits throughout the kingdom Such an union  directed to one view and pressing to one ob∣ject will not easily be resisted by the arms of power or frustrated by the arts of cor∣ruption  ANSWER  SUCH is the gloomy and exaggerated picture of our national distressesSuch are the pretences for cowardly despondency for weak contemptible desertion of all our interests and of all our hopes and for a rash and giddy subservience to that fatal spirit of innovation in the pursuit of im∣provements we never may obtain and to the risque of calamities which we may never remedyBut it is not now the question whether a season of external danger and hostility is the fittest for new arrangements of internal polityWhen it was seen with what industry and activity the same set of men were busied in running from one country to another in private intrigue and public incitement in dictat∣ing where they had no property and can∣vassing where they had no connexious impartial men were led to suspect that the independent and respectable part of the  confederacy far from being the real con∣trivers were but the ostensible authors of the farce of reformationTo erect new assemblies unknown to the constitution which they purposed to reform and pa∣ramount to the legislature which they pro∣fessed to supplicate was a system as sus∣picious in its motive as alarming in its tendencyA Legislature insulted and menaced became the object of factious insolence from every desperate cabalEven Opposition themselves who had first in∣stilled into the minds of men a contempt of order felt in their turn the miseries of lawless uproar and lamented the mis∣chiefs they had producedIt shall not therefore be the present enquiry whe∣ther the worst and most ruinous situation that fancy can imagine could justify a wild licentious anarchy at homeIt is a far plainer and more limited enquiry whether the present is in any degree that ruinous crisis which by extirpating every present hope throws us at once on the unprincipled and profligate violence of theoretic enterprize and speculative de∣spair  or rather whether we may not still preserve our expectations still sustain our spirit and confide both in our na∣tional resources and the courage of our people to reestablish our welfare and re∣gain that respect and consequence in Eu∣rope which the generous spirit of Eng∣land has ever entitled her to maintain as the protectress of liberty and the arbitress of continental freedomIt is a glaring proof of the inconsistency of Opposition that at the same moment when the com∣plicated concerns of so extensive a system are exaggerated with every fanciful aggra∣vation the impolicy of a defensive war should be grafted on the former proposi∣tionTo have maintained an equality at least against combined hostilities does not appear to merit the imputation of ig∣norance so repeatedly thrown upon that department to which the conduct of our navy is entrustedIt is stated as a pro∣vidential escape that Count D'Estaign by the epidemical sickness of his armament was prevented from entering the British ChannelBut on the contrary that  calamity was indeed in its effects a national misfortune to Great BritainFor nothing but sickness could have checked the rash presumption and impetuosity of that Com∣mander from hazarding an action for which our fleet was perfectly prepared and which too as it was impossible to be foreseen be∣came the accidental cause of those very captures which are injuriously stated as the effects of rashness and ignorance in our AdmiraltyIt is clear however that convoys can only be protections against re∣sistance of an inferior kindIt is impos∣sible to provide a convoy for every inward and outwardbound fleet sufficient to de∣feat the combined fleets of France and Spainnor indeed were grand fleets ever directed against mercantile fleets except in those cases where as in the present in∣stance their greater operations had been absolutely prevented by sickness and other accidents equally unforeseen by both par∣tiesWhether an implicit reliance must be paid to those illomened predic∣tions which menace ruin and desolation to our foreign possessions from the ene∣mies  fleets abroad must remain a doubtIt will always be remembered that  two years  have already elapsed since that pe∣riod when the same prophets of Oppo∣sition so peremptorily foretold the absolute impossibility of continuing the war for  one  year longerWith equal solemnity how∣ever the loss of Canada is predicted from the terrors of a French proclamation joined to the evidence of Monsieur de Ternay's possession of Rhode IslandBut however mysterious the former may be little stress can be laid on the latter for the weakness of the Americans in the desertion of an island to their insidious protectors is a very strange proof of English cowardice in surrendering a whole continent which they have gained with glory preserved with humanity and are resolute to defend to the last extremity It must be remembered that Admiral Graves sailed after the French squadron and arrived at Rhode Island much about the same time as Monsieur De Ternay had been admitted there But since that arrival of the English fleet the French  have remained totaly inactive We have the superiority and they haven't dared to fight Indeed the French assistance is far more calculated to support the spirit of party there than to form an expectation of cooperating where they will always disagreeBut if at length the French should determine to make North America the seat of war we certainly may as well fight them there as any where elseWe can but lose America at lastand they them∣selves gain nothing but blows and losses  Yet in contrast to this pacific resigna∣tion to Monsieur De Ternay is Lord Cornwallis's victory compared by those who consider surrenders glorious and victories ruinous  Happy had it been for this country if military wisdom had been exerted in this as in the last war to justify and immor∣talize valour not to depreciate atchieve∣ments which indeed are the decisive condemnation of those who disparage themIf such a principle is once ad∣mitted that defeat and ruin will be our  real advantage it would overturn every spirited exertion to obtain a favourable peace by demonstrating every new ac∣quisition to be a motive for submission every gallant and honourable enterprize a ground of tame acquiescence to degra∣dation and disgraceIt would rob heroism of its best reward and convert victory and triumph to a mere quibbling paradox of debasement and infamy  But with the same policy the misfor∣tunes of our continental situation are exag∣gerated and proclaimed It is admitted to be too plain a truth that far less hopes can be entertained from a rebellion in the Spanish colonies than were confidently cherished in England upon the first idea of American resistanceThe Spanish co∣lonists want indeed the main force and decisive stress of insurgency and rebellionThey want a South American party in Spain to countenance their disaffection to exalt their profligacy to pronounce in a Senate the eulogiums of their leaders to distract the National Councils in their  support to menace the legislature in their defence to sympathize with their suffer∣ings and to triumph in their successBut as to Portugal it is a subject of double grief that to establish the perfidy of that state a military officer once glori∣ously engaged in its defence should now be the tame witness not the gallant avenger of ingratitude and falsehoodIn fact the the learned Commodore was very much courted by the Portuguese nor will that people ever actually quarrel with those whom every commercial interest has fixed their best and surest alliesThe extreme of danger that political prediction can me∣nace is the loss of Minorca which however has always been retained as a point of honour rather than as a necessary possessionWhen we are at peace Gibralter is suffi∣cient for the Mediterranean trade and when at war we have none at allAs to Holland the Dutch have too great a pro∣perty in our funds to assist in destroy∣ing our settlements abroadNor is it possible that the northern powers of Eu∣rope can consider it their interest to over∣turn  a nation to which some of them al∣most owe their existence others their pre∣servation from the jealousy of the house of Bourbon and all have derived a generous liberal mediation and protectionGreat Britain that formerly established Holland can now resist any similar confederacy and in this glorious struggle if she does not ultimately secure a more firm independ∣ance she has already maintained at least an equality of strength every where and has vanquished her enemies whenever they have ventured to contend with herHer situa∣tion in point of defence is better and be∣coming still more so every hourBoth our army and navy are greater in number and better in discipline and order than ever they wereWherever fleets and armies have been sent ours have pursued themIt has always been the rule to fend the newraised regiments abroad in time of war because the few we retain at home should lead and be an example to the militia in case of invasion But to add new force to the national armaments there is no boun∣dary  to the spirit readiness and exer∣tion of individuals at home to support the dignity and the rights of this countryIn one or two instances such singular zeal has called for uncommon honors and in those extraordinary cases alone for a limited time and for a specific service those gentlemen who have hazarded their property and lives for the public safety without any condition of rank or emolument for them∣selves subsequent to such service have been raised to  temporary rank  The complaint of our resources has con∣stantly been repeated when we have actually found them most efficientTen millions were raised last year almost in the course of a day Nearly as much the year before our revenues are improved the sinkingfund is certainly increasingWar has hi∣therto produced no immediate distress to the state and creates a more general cir∣culation than peaceThe captures indeed are an exceptionBut let opposition ex∣plain these effects of  their  jealous dissatis∣faction against the profits of individual con∣tractors  who formerly conducted the whole business and periods of sailing for our mercantile fleetsBut the navyboard hav∣ing undertaken it of late and in the midst of more complicated operations the con∣sequence has been that too many of the convoys of transports with stores men and provisions have failedThe former effec∣ted the business well being well paid for itThe latter have done it ill because they are not paid at all  In such a situation the sense the spirit of this country will still persevere in a just and honourable causeThe happy appearance of returning loyalty in the southern colonies with the certainty of their resources being cut off joined to the gallantry of Lord Cornwallis's expedition up the Chesapeak Bay give the fairest pre∣sage of connecting also the submission of the northern coloniesThe former are most important to us because they are more productive and the inhabitants more na∣turally inclined to us  With such prospects therefore the weak murmurs of domestic disaffection will be despisedThe tyranny of that monster Association will only be a rule to its own miserable vassalsThe independent coun∣trygentlemen who have seen the baneful effects of this fatal spirit in that county where it first arose will guard against the specious impostures of so dangerous an in∣novationThey who in return for a hasty and misplaced confidence received every contumelious and insulting reproach will act with more caution in avoiding those plausible pretences which involve the most fatal consequencesThe little ill that fol∣lowed in that instance will hence be pro∣ductive of the greatest good Every inde∣pendent character will now be no longer alarmed by Association or insulted by in∣structions but persevere in that bold de∣cided manly firmness that has ever been the surest guardian of the rights and li∣berties of Great Britain  MISCELLANEOUS ELOQUENCE OR COLLATERAL RHETORIC FOR THE GALLERY  IN a mixed government like ours public speaking has a sort of relative analogy to the compound structure of our consti∣tution and to the different orders of which it is composed Thus the highest and most exalted rank possesses a proud preeminence of phraseology evidently characteristic of its sovereignty and excellence while the second degree preserves a kind of equipoise in stile which by a due mixture of digni∣ty with plainness denotes its intermediate balance in the scale of legislative eloquenceBut chiefly in the third estate it is pe∣culiarly necessary that the stream of rhe∣toric should have certain particles of popu∣larity perpetually floating on its surface as testimonies of the parent source and foun∣tain from which it springs  Upon this system analogous principles might be formed for the respective orato∣ry of the several degreesAt present however a few documents only shall be suggested for the particular application of this principle to the rhetoric of the House of Commons more especially to that truly constitutional part of it occasionally ad∣dressed to the strangers in the gallery whose "good report" as it is indeed "the brief and abstract  chronicle  " of parliamentary fame it becomes peculiarly prudent as well as honourable to obtain  In general then as to the mode of exer∣cising this miscellaneous eloquence with most ease and efficacy it may be fairly laid down that all eminent and projecting sen∣tences all pointed and epigrammatic quib∣bles all metaphorical menaces violent tropes forced figures and glaring orna∣ments are well calculated to rouse the at∣tention and hitch upon the memory of  the gallery  These like the emphasis of Italics in print∣ing summon the too negligent and careless mind to pay a proper attention to many choice and curious researches intimately con∣nected with the other matter but which might otherwise perish from their refine∣ment or irretrievably slip bye unnoticed  But one of the more certain and secure resources of miscellaneous rhetoric and which I prefer mentioning from its double illustration of precept and example is that conciliating respect which some popular ora∣tors more  directly  pay the  gallery  in down∣right acknowledgment of the  "respectable appearance"  of its company on  "important occasions"  This condescending recognition as it well deserves indeed generally meets with a pro∣per return and it is pleasing to observe how wonderfully attentive the whole body of strangers become at the first mention of this general respectability On some late occa∣sions this idea has been carried somewhat too far for there have not been wanting  certain popular orators who politely with∣held their arguments after each division and avowedly stopt all business till the readmis∣sion of the audience  This however tho' uncommonly hand∣some is dangerous as it may give a handle to some moody malignant mutes for the ab∣solute exclusion of all interlopers on debateBut it will always be good to prepare and scatter as occasion offers some promis∣cuous panegyrics of nearly the same tho' not absolutely so direct a tendencyfor exampleThat  In a constitution like ours every thinking man has a natural interest in public debate which it is tyran∣nical to abridge or violate  Or that  It becomes all wise and cautious constituents to  hear  in order to  judge  of their represen∣tatives  Or again that  It is no small consolation in the present aweful crisis to find a general diffusion of public vigilance and anxiety disseminated among all ranks and orders of men and more particularly in the present numerous and respectable  ap∣pearance  These and all others of the same kind properly accompanied by submissive tones modulated breaks in the voice and collateral attitudes of respectful inclination towards the gallery scarcely ever fail of awakening the grateful attention and sometimes dormant curiosity of the strangers especially at such times as they have painfully and patriotical∣ly persevered to combat both fatigue and appetite in hourly expectation of collecting some scattered scraps of mutilated eloquence for their own private or domestic consump∣tion at  the Lycaeum  or  Belle Assemblee  But in this species of miscellaneous elo∣quence the effect is comparatively weak and contemptible considered with others that are founded upon the same principle  Those already mentioned can only be scattered occasionally in the exordiums and some episodical parts of an orationThe latter and more efficient class must take their station in the peroration and declama∣tory close of prolix speeches as a  corps de∣reserve  to support and reinforce the main body of argument after the harder service of the dayThese ought chiefly to consist of some very new and deep theory ab∣stract and metaphysical and calculated to give an idea of the originality extent and boldness of its author's mind which by connecting so many ingredients of sublimi∣ty tends to inspire a sort of awe for such preeminence of genius and to create a confused notion that this inventive wild∣ness if it could but be applied to the more serious business of politics would with equal brilliancy strike out fresh systems of calculation explore new resources of finance and produce unheard of wonders and revo∣lutions in all the complicated concerns of political enterprize  As this description may serve to convey some idea of the last and highest stile of miscellaneous rhetoric it will be sufficient to elucidate the principle by a single ex∣ample on a subject too not wholly un∣touched in the last sessionUNIVERSAL  WHIGGISMwhich is the better adapted for the proposed illustration from its unit∣ing wildness sublimity invention origi∣nality and a proper degree of extravagance together with various other requisites equally necessary for the perfection of this species of eloquence  Well has it been imagined that every human entity has universal fixed and in∣nate ideas from the first infused in every created soul common to  all  equal to  all  perfect to  all  as perfect to the savage in his cave as to an Englishman in the se∣nateThus has universal nature endow∣ed the whole stock of human race with equal and impartial powers to receive and to enjoy the perfect completion of uni∣versal rights those rights which our first thoughts inspire and which are unalien∣ably the pride and passion of man the rights of UNIVERSAL WHIGGISM To dispense and perfect these vast original blessings to the whole world at large was the great work reserv'd for our own times and for our own countryNow then let  every nation and people of the earth con∣federate in one universal crusade to rescue these sacred birth rights from barbarous violationThe spirit of liberty is gone forthHer voice is the universal lan∣guage of mankindLet it be heard in the echoed thunder of the worldtill UNI∣VERSAL WHIGGISM incorporate with human nature and blend its essence with the soul  ANSWER  IF the form of these essays did not call for some comments on each subject no answer would be attempted to such indis∣putable truths as are contained in the fore∣going documentsA very few words will be offered on this occasion rather as addi∣tions than amendmentsIt is apparent that in the several precepts for miscellane∣ous eloquence there is least novelty in those of the first mentioned class touching the direct or collateral appeals to the judgement and the taste of the gallery most of which every judicious critic will immediately dis∣cover to be closely copied from the higher models of this collateral rhetoric exhibited by the professors of our modern drama wherein it is invariably the custom to over∣charge particular passages as attractive ap∣peals to their gallery also which when properly  given  as the actors phrase it  tell  most surprizingly  But it must be remembered that much of the success in both case depends on a curious interspersion of these brilliances so as to relieve the heavier masses and sustain due proportions of light and shadeFor rhe∣torical flowers must be disposed and mingled with a studious delicacy of arrangement and interweave their blended beauties in just contrast to the coarser texture of more sub∣stantial argument  Thus to adapt our expressions to the sub∣ject in some parts of the rhetorical ground∣work small seedlings of little  violet  tropes should seem to fearfully revoke even the mi∣nuter elegance they so faintly disclosewhile in others more fullblown meta∣phors may diffuse their  roseat  luxuriance and prodigally extend both stem and foliage among the thorny  sweetbriars  of irony or entwining knots of syllogistic  woodbine  with these also there should occasionally be interspersed some brighter ornaments of wit like the spangles of the pattern to va∣riegate the  silken  sentences of perswasion  and set them off with more dazzling de∣coration  As to the latter and far more original division of miscellaneous eloquence though something it must be owned of its baser kind is equally observable in the  fustian∣tags  and  finales  of our more ancient trage∣dies and on the same plan too of leaving a good impression on the gallery yet it is certainly in its true nature and perfect state most completely sublime and in the ex∣emplified instance defective only in its un∣accountably narrow and restricted limitation to this world alone when with equal ease and efficacy it might and ought to be ex∣tended not only to the inhabitants of our own moon and other lunatic countries but also to every nation and people in the whole planetary system so that in any great con∣gress of astronomical worlds  universal whig∣gism  should as certainly be the ruling prin∣ciple of the delegates of Jupiter's satellites as a whigpresident must be deputed by the constituents of Saturn's ringIt is only necessary therefore to add that the respect  for this kind of gigantic rhetoric will be greatly enhanced by a proportionable elocu∣tion and action to justify and grace its mag∣nificenceFor here though the figures are intentionally dilated and monstrous and the colouring systematically overcharged like those of  cupola paintings  yet to the igno∣rant auditor above the rhetoric of the for∣mer will seem as natural and just as the symmetry of the latter appears exact and proportionable to the stupid gazer belowFor the eye and the ear are equally delighted and deceived in both the one and the other case  In the delivery therefore of these  rhetori∣cal caricatures  all that can be requisite to compleat their effect is to accompany them by congenial degrees of violence and vehe∣mence in expression and deportment or in short that the gestures and elocution of the orator who pronounces them may somewhat resemble those of a furious  feugle∣man  or a fanatic in a frenzy  CHANGE THE MINISTRY  AS most of the writers who have treated of the English constitution particularly those of foreign countries very ingeniously prove that a revolution is ne∣cessary once a century to renovate its spi∣rit so in order to proportionably purify our interior government the Ministry by a fair and equable calculation should un∣dergo a change  once  at least if not much oft'ner in the course of every ten years  More or less degrees of this principle of  mutability  are incident to all bodies na∣tural or politic and universally tend to re∣new their genuine force and purity  But if this theory had never before been applied to the administrations of this coun∣try surely the present ministers and the present times would be admitted as irre∣fragable  arguments in favour of that  na∣tional supplication  which now universally prevails for the dismission of a ruinous Ministry and the substitution of a virtuous Opposition  This national demand is grounded on principles as plain as they ought to be decisive namely that the present Mini∣stry are the sole and original causes of that fatal source of all our miseries the Ame∣rican war and on the contrary that Opposition have from the first moment unanimously reprobated the policy and with uniform consistency ever afterwards condemned the principle of colonytaxa∣tion  Such is the plain broad basis of that na∣tional supplication to change the present ruinous and execrated MinistersA sup∣plication which every district of this coun∣try has not only united to enforce but more distinctly promoted with peculiar wisdom in the late honourable delegation of its best and greatest supporters the members of  Westminster and Surrey unawed by the menaces uncorrupted by the odious influ∣ence of prerogative  To this national supplication for the dis∣mission of the present flagitious Ministers the substitution of their virtuous Opposers is by necessary implication inseparably connectedBut if the public virtues of that patriot band have not sufficiently stamp∣ed the justice of their claims on every Eng∣lish heart let cooler and more deli∣berate judgement trace their higher title to preeminence of station in unrivaled supe∣riority of genius in unparallelled excel∣lence of education let their habits studies and private virtues all exercised with un∣dissipated attention to advance the public good all directed to the enrichment of their fellowcitizens the diminution of national expence and the promotion of justice probity and honour be at once the plainest and surest proofs of their dis∣interested views as well as the best pledges of their future upright and honest con∣duct  ANSWER  TO this great and most important of all questions this cause and end of all logic argument and eloquence this attractive power to whose magnetic force all the lightest or weightiest bo∣dies of reasoning must irresistably gra∣vitate with mixed sensations of regret and satisfaction we are at length ar∣rivedHere should every specious de∣duction and every established proof be equally admitted both from the advocates who attack and the witnesses who defend the cause of administrationHere should each slightest particle of evidence each mi∣nute and shadowy distinction of opinion be fairly and impartially deposited in that golden balance which evenhanded justice should suspend and poise to weigh the doubtful conflict of political warfareBut to assist at such a trial would be far too so∣lemn too laborious for profaner pens  It is a task that may be consigned with far greater security to the busy zeal and persevering patience of polemical politi∣ciansA hasty and imperfect answer to the foregoing argument shall conclude  these  slighter toilsIt must be owned then that the philosophy of ministerial changes is worthy the solidity of its fo∣reign theoristsIt seems indeed very closely borrowed from the Parisian vicissitudes of fashion dress and even furniture for the respective seasonsOn so accommo∣dating a system many fanciful varieties might be practised to variegate successive administrations which with that view might be  quarterly  and composed of more  decided  characters for the two greater divi∣sions of the year and a kind of  demisaison  statesmen for the lesser  This would give an impartial rotation to all sorts of parties and by a just adaption of dispositions and tempers analogous to their successive periods might produce the happiest and most extraordinary effectsFor young adventuring politicians might  sow the principles of a scheme in the spring administration which when cultivated and matured by coalitions of the summer and autumnal ministries would finally pro∣duce the richest fruits to be treasured and dispensed by the colder caution and  wintry  wisdom of more experienced counsellors But after all changes of ministry are neither as sudden nor as easy as changes of wea∣ther or changes of scenery at a play houseAnd as the principle of  mutability  was not much insisted on it will be fairer to re∣cur to the more serious and material sub∣stance of the argumentThe petitionsand the two other great pointsthe  origin  of our troublesand the consistency of opposition  To these it may be briefly answered that if it can possibly be prov'd that  one  of the petitions was not invented framed and circulated by those gentlemen whose ap∣pointment and elevation they severally dic∣tate the truth of them  all  shall be univer∣sally admittedBut on the contrary if the whole pile of them was raised fabrica∣ted  and supported by one and the same set of men for one and the same purpose the force of their evidence will not be much relied onNext as to the  origin  of the war it is sufficient to repeat that trite truth "  The  STAMP ACT was not the work of the present ministry" And in respect to the uniform resistance to the principle of American subordination the equally selfevident proposition must al∣ways be remembered "That to opposition alone are we indebted for that absolute and universal claim to it THE DECLARATORY LAW"Two most trite refutations of the two tritest of all charges which however as indisputably disprove the imputed de∣linquency on the one side as they abso∣lutely overthrow the ridiculous claim to consistency on the other  But with regard indeed to the great crite∣rion of national opinion  the two popular elec∣tions  certainly much stress is wisely and justly laid upon  that  pointnor would it prove an unpleasing task for some advocate of op∣position to draw an exact parallel in the  manner of Plutarch between the  four  trium∣phant candidates wherein it would as evi∣dently appear that the  two  admirals who se∣verally share these domestic honours are not more precisely alike in principles and con∣duct than the two statesmen also of the same elections resemble each other in high birth exalted genius cultivated taste sound reasoning strict honour and  undamped  for∣titudeWhich close and mathematical consideration of the several relative pro∣portions of merit thus mutually com∣pared in their respective parallels must not only demonstrate the exact correspon∣dence of their reciprocal excellencies and therefore by fair consequence the truth and justice of declaring these two elec∣tions a common and equal standard of national opinion but also at once overthrow every cavilling notion that may arise of their rediculous dissimilitude and establish them for the whole succeeding session of parliament as the great political parallel∣logram of public spirit  It may however be unnecessary to continue much longer the mysterious insinuation of INFLUENCE so industriously circulated preparatory to these boasted triumphsat the moment it might have been judicious nay possibly necessary to lean on this po∣pular argumentBut to continue it might now appear unworthy the gallantry and spirit of its author if not too like the fret∣ful resource of disappointed prideWhen the tempest had dissevered the good old vessel despair might fly to any refugeThe gilded lion at the head was then no longer to be upheld by romantic enthu∣siasm as the glittering sign and splendid presage of  victory  distress and danger had destroyed all fanciful respect and exhaus∣ted sinking strength caught at that majestic ruin which faithfull even to its debaser elevated and supported the very hand that selfishly depressed itIt has had its useperformed its serviceLet it be no longer exposed and dragged about for low mockery and insolent profanation but generously and gratefully  laid up  like a vo∣tive  tablet in the temple of Neptune the consecrated record of unhopedfor refuge  It remains only to say a few words on the last and powerful argument for the Change of Ministry namely the decisive superi∣ority of abilities on the part of Oppositionthis favourite  common place  so perpetually and so modestly urged might lead to per∣sonal parallels of all others the most invi∣dious as well as disputableOn this question every man must judge for him∣selfAll that shall be said here is this that it must indeed be a much more infi∣nite superiority of talent than frequently occurs in the scale of human understand∣ing that can at once render the qualifica∣tions of any set of men who are compa∣ratively unconversant with official business or at least not equally versed of late years in political negociations foreign or domes∣tic so supremely superexcellent to those of others some of whom have been literally educated in office others passed the greatest part of their lives in foreign embassies of  complicated concern with the ablest and purest reputation and all are perfectly  equal  to their competitors in every advan∣tage of rank and situationTo this the thousand declamatory common place re∣plies of practised fraud veteran subtlety and professional treachery as they may be easily imagined shall be silently despisedCertainly there are individuals in oppo∣sition of most extensive and possibly un∣equalled understanding the accession of whose abilities would give lustre to public council and be indeed almost a national blessingBut if the miserable appendages of party must for ever fix their ponderous and oppressive influence on talents formed for free and bold aspiring then may their perverted excellence be justly pronounced the ruin of their country and while to vul∣gar observation this luminous and malig∣nant prodigy this splendid but baneful por∣tent scatters terror and amazement by every more thinking mind it will at once be wondered at and lamented admired and deploredFor preeminence of genius becomes doubly pernicious by the abuse of  its own superiority and the contaminating degradation of the faculties of others and is indeed both in effect and by exampleThe decay of a whole age
