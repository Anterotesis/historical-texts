 A New and most Accurate THEORY OF THE Moon's Motion Whereby all her Irregularities may be solved and her Place truly calculated to Two Minutes  Written by That Incomparable Mathematician Mr  ISAAC NEWTON  And Published in  Latin  by Mr  DAVID GREGORY  in his  Excellent Astronomy    LONDON Printed and sold by  A Baldwin  in  Warwicklane    TO THE READER·  THE Irregularity of the Moon's Motion hath been all along the just Complaint of Astronomers and indeed I have always look'd upon it as a great Misfortune that a Planet so near us as the Moon is and which might be so wonderfully useful  to us by her  Motion  as well as her  Light  and  Attraction  by which our Tides are chiefly occasioned should have her Orbit so unaccountably various that it is in a manner vain to depend on any Calculation of an  Eclipse  a  Transit  or an  Appulse  of her tho never so accurately made Whereas could her Place be but truly calculated the Longitudes of Places would be found every where at Land with great Facility and might be nearly guess'd at Sea without the help of a Telescope which cannot there be used  This Irregularity of the Moon's Motion depends as is now well known since Mr  Newton  hath demonstrated the Law of Universal Gravitation on the Attraction  of the Sun which perturbs the Motion of the Moon and of all other  Satellites  or secondary Planets and makes her move sometimes faster and sometimes slower in her Orbit and makes consequently an Alteration in the Figure of that Orbit as well as of its Inclination to the Plain of the Ecliptick But this being  now  to be accounted for and reduced to a Rule by this Theory such Allowances are made for it as that the Place of the Planet shall be truly  Equated    This therefore being perfectly  New  and what the Lovers of Astronomy have a long while been put in hopes to receive from the  Great Hand  that hath now finished  it I thought it would be of good service to our Nation to give it an  English  Dress and publish it by it self For as Dr  Gregory  's  Astronomy  is a large and scarce Book it is neither every ones Money that can purchase it nor Acquaintance that can procure it and besides I hope we have a great many Persons in  England  that have  Skill  and  Patience  enough to calculate a Planet's Place who yet it may be don't well enough understand the  Latin  Tongue to make themselves Masters of this Theory in the Author's own Words At least I perswade my self that a Theory so easy and plain as this which carries along with it such a Pretence to Exactness will encourage many Persons to imploy themselves in Astronomical  Calculation which before possibly they neglected because they judged there was but little Exactness to be attained in it And this would be a very useful way of spending their leisure Hours and if they would oblige us with the Publication of good  Ephemerides Tables  c they would soon enflame others with a Desire of pursuing these kind of Studies  The Famous Mr  Isaac Newton  's THEORY OF THE MOON  THIS Theory hath been long expected by the Lovers of Art and is now publish'd in Dr  Gregory  's Astronomy in Mr  Newton  's own Words  By this Theory what by all Astronomers was thought most difficult and almost impossible to be done the Excellent Mr  Newton  hath now effected  viz  to determine the Moon's Place even in her Quadratures and all other Parts of her Orbit besides the Syzygys so accurately by Calculation that the Difference between that and her true Place in the Heavens shall scarce be two Minutes and is usually so small that it may well enough be reckon'd only as a Defect in the Observation And this Mr  Newton  experienced by comparing it with very many Places of the Moon observ'd by Mr  Flamstead  and communicated to him  The Royal Observatory at  Greenwich  is to the West of the Meridian of  Paris  ° ′ Of  Vraniburgh  ° ′ ″ And of  Gedanum  ° ′  The mean Motions of the Sun and Moon accounted from the Vernal Equinox at the Meridian of  Greenwich  I make to be as followeth The last Day of  December  at Noon Old Stile the mean Motion of the Sun was  Sign  ° ′ ″ Of the Sun's Apogaeum was  Sign  ° ′ ″  The mean Motion of the Moon at that time was  Sign  ° ′ ″ And of her Apogee  Sign  ° ′ ″ Of the Ascending Node of the Moon's Orbit  Sign  ° ′ ″  And on the last Day of  December  at Noon the mean Motion of the Sun was  Sign  ° ′ ″ Of the Sun's Apogee  Sign  ° ′ ″ The mean Motion of the Moon was  Sign  ° ′ ″ Of the Moon's Apogee  Sign  ° ′ ″ And of her ascending Node  Sign  ° ′ ″ For in  Julian  Years or Days  the Sun's Motion is  Revolut    Sign  ° ′ ″ And the Motion of the Sun's Apogee ′ ″  The Motion of the Moon in the same Time is  Rev    Sign  ° ′ ″ And the Motion of the Lunar Apogee is  Revol    Sign  ° ′ ″ And the Motion of her Node  Revol    Sign  ° ′ ″  All which Motions are accounted from the Vernal Equinox Wherefore if from them there be subtracted the Recession or Motion of the Equinoctial Point  in Antecedentia  during that space which is ′ ″ there will remain the Motions in reference to the Fixt Stars in  Julian  Years  viz  the Sun's  Revol    Sign  ° ′ ″ Of his Apogee ′ ″ And the Moon's  Revol    Sign  ° ′ ″ Of her Apogee  Revol    Sign  ° ′ ″ And of the Node of the Moon  Revol    Sign  ° ′ ″  According to this Computation the  Tropical Year  is  Days    Hours  ′ ″ And the  Sydereal Year  is  Days    Hours  ′ ″  These mean Motions of the Luminaries are affected with various Inequalities Of which  There are the Annual Equations of the aforesaid mean Motions of the Sun and Moon and of the Apogee and Node of the Moon  The Annual Equation of the mean Motion of the Sun depends on the Eccentricity of the Earth's Orbit round the Sun which is of such Parts as that the Earth's mean Distance from the Sun shall be Whence 'tis called the  Equation of the Centre  and is when greatest ° ′ ″  The greatest Annual Equation of the Moon's mean Motion is ′ ″ of her Apogee ′ and of her Node ′ ″  And these four Annual Equations are always mutually proportional one to another Wherefore when any of them is at the greatest the other three will also be greatest and when any one lessens the other three will also be diminished in the same  Ratio    The Annual Equation of the Sun's Centre being given the three other corresponding Annual Equations will be also given and therefore a Table of  that  will serve for all For if the Annual Equation of the Sun's Centre be taken from thence for any Time and be called P and let P = Q Q + Q = R ⅙ P= D D + D = E and D D = F then shall the Annual Equation of the Moon's mean Motion for that time be R that of the Apogee of the Moon will be E and that of the Node F  Only observe here that if the Equation of the Sun's Centre be required  to be  added  then the Equation of the Moon's mean Motion must be  subtracted  that of her Apogee must be  added  and that of the Node  subducted  And on the contrary if the Equation of the Sun's Centre were to be  subducted  the Moon's Equation must be  added  the Equation of her Apogee  subducted  and that of her Node  added    There is also an  Equation of the Moon's mean Motion  depending on the Situation of her Apogee in respect of the Sun which is  greatest  when the Moon's Apogee is in an Octant with the Sun and is nothing at all when it is in the Quadratures or Syzygys This Equation when greatest and the Sun  in Perigaeo  is ′ ″ But if the Sun be  in Apogaeo  it will never be above ′ ″ At other Distances of the Sun from the Earth this Equation when greatest is reciprocally as the Cube of such Distance But when  the Moon's Apogee is any where but in the  Octants  this Equation grows less and is mostly at the same distance between the Earth and Sun as the Sine of the double Distance of the Moon's Apogee from the next Quadrature or Syzygy to the Radius  This is to be  added  to the Moon's Motion while her Apogee passes from a Quadrature with the Sun to a Syzygy but is to be  subtracted  from it while the Apogee moves from the Syzygy to the Quadrature  There is moreover another  Equation of the Moon's Motion  which depends on the Aspect of the Nodes of the Moon's Orbit with the Sun and this is  greatest  when her Nodes are in  Octants  to the Sun and vanishes quite when they come to their Quadratures or Syzygys This Equation is proportional to the Sine of the double Distance of the  Node from the next Syzygy or Quadrature and at greatest is but ″ This must be  added  to the Moon's mean Motion while the Nodes are passing from their Syzygys with the Sun to their Quadratures with him but  subtracted  while they pass from the Quadratures to the Syzygys  From the Sun's true Place take the equated mean Motion of the Lunar Apogee as was above shewed the Remainder will be the Annual Argument of the said Apogee From whence the  Eccentricity of the Moon  and the  second Equation  of her Apogee may be compar'd after the manner following  which takes place also in the Computation of any other intermediate Equations  Let T represent the Earth TS a Right Line joining the Earth and Sun TACB a Right Line drawn from the Earth to the middle or mean Place of the Moon's Apogee equated as above Let the Angle STA be the Annual Argument of the aforesaid Apogee TA the least Eccentricity of the Moon's Orbit TB the greatest Bissect AB in C and on the Centre C with the Distance AC describe a Circle AFB and make the Angle BCF = to the  double of the Annual Argument Draw the Right Line TF that shall be the Eccentricity of the Moon's Orbit and the Angle BTF is the second Equation of the Moon's Apogee required  In order to whose Determination let the mean Distance of the Earth from the Moon or the Semidiameter of the Moon's Orbit be then shall its  greatest Eccentricity  TB be such Parts and the  least  TA So that the greatest Equation of the Orbit  viz  when the Apogee is in the Syzygys will be ° ′ ″ or perhaps ° ′ for I suspect there will be some Alteration according to the Position of the Apogee in ♋ or in ♑ But when it is in Quadrature to the Sun the greatest Equation aforesaid will be ° ′ ″ and the greatest Equation of the Apogee ° ′ ″  Having from these Principles made a Table of the Equation of the Moon's Apogee and of the Eccentricitys of her Orbit to each degree of the Annual Argument from whence the Eccentricity TF and the Angle BTF  viz  the second and principal Equation of the Apogee may easily be had for any Time required let the Equation thus found be added to the first Equated Place of the Moon's Apogee if the Annual Argument be less than ° or greatear than ° and less than otherwise it must be subducted from it and the Sum or Difference shall be the Place of the Lunar Apogee secondarily equated which being taken from the Moon's Place equated a third time shall leave the mean Anomaly of the Moon corresponding to any given Time Moreover from this mean Anomaly of the Moon and the beforefound Eccentricity of her Orbit may be found by means of a Table of Equations  of the Moon's Centre made to every degree of the mean Anomaly and some Eccentricitys  viz  and the  Prostaphaeresis  or Equation of the Moon's Centre as in the common way and this being taken from the former Semicircle of the middle Anomaly and  added  in the latter to the Moon's Place thus thrice equated will produce the Place of the Moon a fourth time equated  The greatest Variation of the Moon  viz  that which happens when the Moon is in an Octant with the Sun is nearly reciprocally as the Cube of the Distance of the Sun from the Earth Let that be taken ′ ″ when the Sun is  in Perigaeo  and ′ ″ when he is  in Apogaeo  And let the Differences of this Variation in the Octants be made reciprocally as the Cubes of the Distances of the Sun from the Earth and so let a Table  be made of the aforesaid Variation of the Moon in her  Octants  or its Logarithms to every  Tenth Sixth  or  Fifth  Degree of the mean Anomaly And for the Variation out of the Octants make as Radius to the Sine of the double Distance of the Moon from the next Syzygy or Quadrature ∷ so let the aforefound Variation in the Octant be to the Variation congruous to any other Aspect and this  added  to the Moon's Place before found in the first and third Quadrant accounting from the Sun or  subducted  from it in the second and fourth will give the Moon's Place equated a fifth time  Again as Radius to the Sine of the Sum of the Distances of the Moon from the Sun and of her Apogee from the Sun's Apogee or the Sine of the Excess of that Sum above ° ∷ so is ′ ″ to a sixth Equation of the Moon's Place which must be  subtracted  if  the aforesaid Sum or Excess be less than a Semicircle but  added  if it be greater Let it be made also as Radius to the Sine of the Moon's Distance from the Sun ∷ so ′ ″ to a seventh Equation which when the Moon's Light is encreasing  add  but when decreasing  subtract  and the Moon's Place will be equated a seventh time and this is her Place  in her proper Orbit    Note here the Equation thus produced by the mean Quantity ′ ″ is not always of the same Magnitude but is encreased and diminished according to the Position of the Lunar Apogee For if the Moon's Apogee be in Conjunction with the Sun's the aforesaid Equation is about ″ greater but when the Apogees are in opposition 'tis about as much less and it librates between its greatest Quantity ′ ″ and its least ′ ″ And this is when the Lunar Apogee is in Conjunction or Opposition with  the Sun's But in the Quadratures the aforesaid Equation is to be lessen'd about ″ or one Minute when the Apogees of the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction but if they are in Opposition for want of a sufficient number of Observations I cannot determine whether it is to be lessen'd or increas'd And even as to the Argument or Decrement of the Equation ′ ″ above mentioned I dare determine nothing certain for the same Reason  viz  the want of Observation accurately made  If the sixth and seventh Equations are augmented or diminished in a reciprocal  Ratio  of the Distance of the Moon from the Earth  i e  in a direct  Ratio  of the Moon's Horizontal Parallax they will become more accurate And this may readily be done if Tables are first made to each Minute of the said Parallax and to every sixth or fifth Degree of the Argumennt of the  sixth Equation for the  Sixth  as of the Distance of the Moon from the Sun for the  Seventh  Equation  From the Sun's Place take the mean Motion of the Moon's ascending Node equated as above the Remainder shall be the Annual Argument of the Node whence its second Equation may be computed after the following manner in the preceding Figure  Let T as before represent the Earth TS a Right Line conjoining the Earth and Sun Let also the Line TACB be drawn to the Place of the Ascending Node of the Moon as above equated and let STA be the Annual Argument of the Node Take TA from a Scale and let it be to AB ∷ as to or as ⅔ to Then bissect BA in C and on C as a Centre with the Distance CA describe a Circle as AFB and make the Angle BCF equal to double the Annual Argument of the Node before found So shall the Angle BTF be the second Equation of the Ascending Node which must be  added  when the Node is passing from a Quadrature to a Syzygy with the Sun and  subducted  when the Node moves from a Syzygy towards a Quadrature By which means the true Place of the Node of the Lunar Orbit will be gained whence from Tables made after the common way the  Moon's Latitude and the Reduction of her Orbit to the Ecliptick  may be computed supposing the Inclination of the Moon's Orbit to the Ecliptick to be ° ′ ″ when the Nodes are in Quadrature with the Sun and ° ′ ″ when they are in the Syzygys  And from the Longitude and Latitude thus found and the given Obliquity of the Ecliptick ° ′ the Right Ascension and Declination of the Moon will be found  The Horizontal Parallax of the Moon when she is in the Syzygys at a mean Distance from the Earth I make to be ′ ″ and her Horary Motion ′ ″ ‴ and her apparent Diameter ′ ″ But in her Quadratures at a mean Distance from the Earth I make the Horizontal Parallax of the Moon to be ′ ″ her Horary Motion ′ ″ ‴ and her apparent Diameter ′  ″ The Moon in an Octant to the Sun and at a mean Distance hath her Centre distant from the Centre of the Earth about of the Earth's SemiDiameters  The Sun's Horizontal Parallax I make to be ″ and its apparent Diameter at a mean Distance from the Earth I make ′ ″  The Atmosphere of the Earth by dispersing and refracting the Sun's Light casts a Shadow as if it were an Opake Body at least to the height of or Geographical Miles by a Geographical Mile I mean the sixtieth Part of a Degree of a great Circle on the Earth's Surface This Shadow falling upon the Moon in a Lunar Eclipse makes the Earth's Shadow be the  larger or broader  And to each Mile of the Earth's Atmosphere is correspondent a Second in the Moon's Disk so that the Semidiameter of the Earth's Shadow projected  upon the Disk of the Moon is to be encreased about Seconds or which is all one in a Lunar Eclipse the Horizontal Parallax of the Moon is to be encreased in the Ratio of about to  Thus far the Theory of this Incomparable Mathematician And if we had many Places of the Moon  accurately observed  especially about her Quadratures and these well compared with her Places at the same time calculated according to this Theory it would then appear whether there yet remain any other sensible Equations which when accounted for might serve to improve and enlarge this Theory  Dr  Greg Astr Elem Phys Geom p    FINIS
