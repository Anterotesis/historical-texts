 JOURNAL OF CAPTAIN COOK's LAST VOYAGE TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN  JOURNAL OF CAPTAIN COOK's LAST VOYAGE TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN ON DISCOVERY PERFORMED IN THE YEARS AND  ILLUSTRATED WITH CUTS AND A CHART SHEWING THE TRACKS OF THE SHIPS EMPLOYED IN THIS EXPEDITION  A NEW EDITION COMPARED WITH AND CORRECTED FROM THE VOYAGE PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY  LONDON PRINTED FOR E NEWBERY AT THE CORNER OF ST PAUL'S CHURCHYARD MDCCLXXXV  PREFACE  THE EDITOR of this Voyage which has already past through Three Editions with the approbation of those who were companions in the expedition and sharers in the dangers of it has still the farther satisfaction on comparing the original journal with that now published by authority to find the facts and dates the latitudes and longitudes those essentials of a Voyage undertaken for Discovery so exactly to correspond as could hardly have been expected from journals kept on board the same ship by different observers who had no communication with each otherNo greater proof is therefore necessary to establish its authenticity  Our Journalist appears to have been a man who to great professional skill had added all the requisites of an instructive Voyager Attentive to every material transaction on board his own ship he had been careful to inform himself of every thing that affected the Voyage on board the other  When in harbour the manners the customs the virtues and the vices the arts and manufactures of the inhabitants of the different  countries their productions animal and vegetable seem to have been no less the objects of his enquiry  Amidst other observations even the errors committed in the progress of the Voyage does not escape him nor does he fail to express his admiration of those wonderful powers that amidst innumerable difficulties into which some casual mistakes had involved the fate of both ships could surmount every obstacle that stood in the way of accomplishing the first object of the Voyage insomuch that before the last fatal miscarriage that deprived the Commander in Chief of his life the way was smoothed and every thing put on such a footing as to afford wellgrounded hopes of a happy issue  It must astonish the world if any thing can astonish the navigating world that  one  year being lost in which a third of the provisions for a  three years  Voyage was consumed as it were in waste without the possibility of supplying the chief articles of an English seaman's subsistence at sea namely beef bread flour spirits and tobacco the Voyage could notwithstanding be protracted for four years without a man suffering by hunger and but four men dying of any disease whatever  Of the adventures of those who performed the Voyage little is related in the work published by authority and if we except  the desertion of the petty officer and mate from the ships at Ulitea with the vain hope of aspiring at principalities in Otaheite and the unexpected meeting with the Russians at Oonalaska we meet with nothing calculated either to excite pleasure or move pain till the unfortunate death of Capt Cook  Our Voyager however has not been unmindful of what the public had a right to expect from Voyagers who had visited and revisited every corner of the earth and who had not been insensible to the charms of the young females with whom they must have had so many opportunities to converse but to all that has been related in the  solid  narrative of Capt Cook not a circumstance of which has been omitted he has added others which though a little partaking of the marvellous have yet their foundation in incontrovertible truth  But in this Preface as it is not our intention to anticipate the pleasure the Reader will undoubtedly receive in the perusal of this small volume we shall only just premise that it is not an abridgement or an abstract from the work published by authority but a distinct original work authenticated by a comparison with that written by the Captains Cook and King and agreeing with them in the essential points of discovery and containing many particulars unnoticed in their narrative without which  the account of the Voyage must be incompleat  If the Editor may claim any merit for the part he has taken in the performance it is in collecting together in the introduction a short and he hopes not an unentertaining summary of all the Voyages undertaken for  discovery only  in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres and in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans It were needless to enumerate the many volumes consulted on this occasion The intelligent Reader will bear testimony to not a few But for the latter Voyages of Lieutenants Pickersgill and Young he must acknowledge himself indebted to the Editor of the Voyage published by authority  INTRODUCTION  TWO illustrious foreigners Columbus and Magellan rendered their names immortal at an early period by opening an immense field for discovery and the improvement of Navigation but it has been reserved for a distinguished native of this country and of this age to fix the boundaries of the globe and to complete the great plan of nautical investigation The two last fell in the prosecution of the important discoveriesthe first survived only to experience the vicissitudes of fortune and to  feel  the resentment of an ungrateful court  Columbus by a perseverance of which there was then no precedent very providentially surmounted every obstacle that opposed his progress and astonished Europe with the discovery of an unknown  Continent  while much about the same time Magellan inspired by a like spirit of enterprise and animated by a magnanimity that despised danger while in the pursuit of glory opened a passage to an Unknown Sea  By a brief recapitulation of the attempts made to improve these discoveries and by shewing what has already been effected what remained still to be done will be more apparent and will furnish an idea of the immensity of the undertakingno less than to settle the extremes of the two continents  which though separated to all human appearance most certainly connect the globe  It was on the th of November in the year that Magellan entered the Straits that have ever since borne his name and the th of the same month when in a transport of joy he beheld the wishedfor object of his pursuit the GREAT SOUTHERN SEAa passage so rapid as has never since been equalled Elated with success he proceeded chearfully for several days with a favouring gale but the weather soon changing and the sea growing boisterous he altered his course from the high latitude in which he entered and directed his views to a more moderate climate For days he continued steering to the northwest without seeing land or meeting with supplies of any kind except what water the sailors could save in the awnings when the storms of thunder which were frequent and dreadful burst the clouds and unloosed the rain Having in that time crossed the line he fell in with a range of islands in the th degree of northern latitude where with great difficulty he procured some refreshment for those of his followers who yet remained alive most of them having perished by hunger and fatigue in that long run of lonesome navigation Those who survived had fed on tough hides the leather of their shoes and even on that which surrounded the ropes Add to this that many of them being attacked by the scurvy the flesh of their gums had so enveloped their teeth that unable to eat they died famished in all the agonies of horror and despair The thievish disposition of the tropical islanders in this ocean to which Magellan now gave the name of PACIFIC being new to the Spaniards they were not at first apprised that while they were abroad enjoying the salutary effects of  the refreshing air the natives were employed in stripping the ships of their iron and whatever else they could carry away It was in vain to punish the delinquents for where all were culpable those only could be made to suffer who were taken in the fact and such was their dexterity that few were detected  From these islands to which Magellan gave the name of Ladrones he hastened his departure and proceeding in search of the Moluccas the chief object of his voyage he found in his way many little islands where he was hospitably received and where a friendly correspondence was established by which mutual civilities and mutual good offices were reciprocally interchanged  These islands were situated between the Ladrones and what are now known by the name of the Philippines in one of which named Nathan Magellan with men having encountered a whole army was first wounded with a poisoned arrow and then pierced with a bearded lance His little squadron reduced by accumulated distress to two ships with not more than men to navigate them departed hastily and after many disasters in which only one the Victory escaped she singly returned by the Cape of Good Hope and was the first ship that circumnavigated the globe It may not be improper here to remark that the death of our late gallant Commander Cook was not unsimilar to that of Magellan both originating from an over confidence in their own consequence which could avail them nothing when surrounded by exasperated savages and overpowered by numbers  Other adventures were not now wanting to trace the steps of this intrepid Navigator but they were not all actuated by the same passion for glory  Alvarez de Mendano indeed who in was sent from Lima on discovery sailed leagues westward from the coast of Peru and fell in with certain islands in degrees south inhabited by people of a yellowish colour whose weapons were bows and arrows and darts and whose bodies were naked but strangely punctuated Here the Spaniards besides swine found little dogs and some domestic fowls like those in Europe and here likewise they found cloves ginger cinnamon and some gold but it has yet been a question undecided to what groupe of islands this discovery is to be referred from whence the Spaniards  "  not seeking gold  brought home pezoes"  Captain Cook inclines to think that they were the cluster which comprizes what has since been known by the name of New Britain  Mendano afterwards discovered the Archipelago of islands called the Islands of Solomon of which great and small he counted thirtythree He also in discovered the island of St Christoval not far from the above Archipelago in deg south but having no settled plan to direct his pursuit it is no wonder that he should leave his discoveries imperfect and that as they produced no immediate profit they should long remain unnoticed by less curious adventurers It was in those early times considered as sound policy to throw a veil of secrecy over new discoveries it is to the honour of the present times that the contrary practice almost universally prevails  Sir Francis Drake in was the first Englishman that passed the Straits already noticed and though his views were not the most honourable nor founded upon principles that could be strictly justified yet his discoveries were no less important than if patronised by his sovereign and the expence  defrayed by the legislature He discovered the coast of California which he judged to be an island and named it New Albion and having sailed to the d deg of northern latitude with a design to return by a northeast course was stopt in his progress by the piercing cold Some small islands he discovered in his route but as his sole view was to return with his booty he paid no regard to objects of less concern He arrived in England by the Cape of Good Hope in  To him succeeded Sir Thomas Cavendish who likewise passed the Straits of Magellan in and returned nearly by the same tract touching at the Landrones and making some stay at the Philippine Isles of which on his return he gave a full description  In the mean time namely in the Spaniards intent upon discovery more than plunder fitted out four ships and gave the command to Alvaro Mendana de Neyra This voyage proved unfortunate The design was to have compleated the discovery of the Solomon Islands and to have made a settlement in one of the most plentiful But most of those who embarked on this expedition either died of hunger and disease or were shipwrecked His discoveries were the Marqueses in lat south Solitary Island in ° ′ west long ° and lastly Santa Cruz on which one of the fleet was afterwards found with all her sails set and the people rotten Soon after this miscarriage it was resolved by the Spanish court not to settle those islands lest the English and other foreign adventurers who might pass the Straits should in their passage home by the EastIndies be relieved by them This resolution however we find soon after revoked in favour of Quiros  In Oliver Van Noort passed the Straits but his professed design being plunder he made no discoveries He touched to refresh at one of the Ladrone islands in his way to the EastIndies and afterwards refitted his ships at the Philippines It may here be necessary to note that in this year the Sebaldine islands as they were formerly called were discovered by Sebald de Weert the same now known by the name of Falkland's Isles  In Pedro Fernando de Quiros conceived the design of discovering a southern continent He is supposed by Mr Dalrymple and others to have been the first man into whose mind the existence of such a continent had ever entered He sailed from Calloa December st with two ships and a tender Luis Paz de Torres was entrusted with the command and Quiros from zeal for the success of the undertaking was contented to act in the inferior station of pilot On the th of January following they came in sight of a small flat island about four leagues in circumference with some trees but to all appearance uninhabited It was just leagues from Calloa and said to lie in the th deg of S latitude Finding it inaccessible they pursued their voyage and in two days fell in with another island which Capt Cook supposes the same discovered by Capt Carteret and by him called Pitcairn's Island  On the th of February they discovered an island thirty leagues in circumference that promised fair to supply their necessities which now began to be very pressing but this like the former could not be approached This island situated in lat S seemed to determine their course to the south for on the th of February we find them in the th deg south and on the th in the th deg in conference with the inhabitants  of a friendly island from whom with difficulty they procured some refreshment and on the th continued their course On the st they discovered an island where they found plenty of fish but no water It was uninhabited and the birds so tame that they caught them with their hands They named this island St Bernardo and is probably the same which Capt Carteret calls the Island of Danger in lat ° ′ S  The next island discovered they called Isla de la Gente Hermosa or the Isle of handsome people From thence they steered for Santa Cruz already discovered where they were kindly received but did not leave it without murdering some of the inhabitants  From this island they steered their course westward passing swarms of little islands till they arrived on the th of April at a lofty island which by its high and black appearance they judged to be a Volcano Here they found a friendly reception and in return carried off four of their natives three of whom afterwards made their escape by watching their opportunity and jumping into the sea the fourth accompanied them to New Spain This island the Indians called Taumaco Another island in deg S na  d Tucopia they passed after some friendly intercourse with the inhabitants and on the th of April came in sight of an island which they named Nostra Signora de la Luz in deg S and presently after observed four others islands one of which presented a most picturesque appearance diversified with every beauty which Nature could display rivers pools of water cascades and fountains to decorate and dignify the prospect Here the inhabitants were frank as their country was abundant but here the Spaniards could not help  discovering their natural jealousy The first who approached their boat was a youth of graceful stature him they thought to have secured by slily throwing a chain about his leg but this the Indian snapt and instantly made his escape by jumping overboard the next who came on board they placed in the stocks by stratagem lest he too should make his escape in the same manner Could it be wondered therefore that the friends of these imprisoned youths should endeavour by fair appearances to ensnare their enemies and seek revenge Making signs of peace the Spaniards no sooner came within their reach than they let fly a volley of poisoned arrows by which several of the crew were wounded Interpreting this as an act of treachery without attending to the cause that had produced it they quitted the island in the night and directing their course to the SouthWest came in sight of an immense country which had every appearance of the continent of which they were in search They perceived an open bay and on the beach men of a gigantic stature To this land they made their approaches with inexpressible joy imagining that they had accomplished their wishes and that their labours would soon be rewarded with honour to themselves and advantage to their country  On the d of May they entered the harbour having the day before given the name of St PHILIP and St JAMES to the  bay  with the fair appearance of which they had been so highly delighted To the  port  they gave the name of LA VERA CRUZ and to the  country  AUSTRAL DEL ESPERITO SANTO The harbour situated between two rivers to which they gave the names of Jurdan and Salvador was equally convenient and beautiful the margin of the shores was most romantically  interspersed with flowers and plants odoriferous and splendid nor was the country less fruitful than it was pleasant It abounded in all those delicious fruits which render the countries between the Tropics the happiest in the world and there were besides great plenty of swine dogs fowls and birds of various kinds and colours The inhabitants indeed were jealous of their approach and discovered great uneasiness at their attempting to land The Spaniards however rather chusing to intimidate than conciliate the natives made an excursion into the country surprized the unsuspecting people of a little village and brought off a supply of hogs but not without imminent danger to the party employed on that service who were pursued to the water's edge and some of them wounded  As Nature had dealt her bounty with a liberal hand to the inhabitants of this happy country she had enriched her coasts with fish as well as the land with fruits In pursuit of the former the Spaniards met with no interruption but their success which was very great was near proving fatal to them They caught large quantities of a most beautiful fish which though of a delicate flavour was of so poisonous a quality that whoever eat of it was suddenly seized with sickness and pain for which there appeared no remedy Every soldier and every sailor was grievously affected the whole ships companies were rendered incapable of their duty and officers and people were alike alarmed with the apprehensions of approaching death till by degrees the violence of the disorder began to abate and in six days all were restored It is worthy of note that some of the crew of the Resolution in Capt Cook's former voyage who had eaten of a fish caught in those seas were seized  in the same manner and that the swine and dogs that had eaten the entrails and the bones actually died  Quiros for what reason does not appear very soon quitted this  promised land  and the two ships separated as soon as they had cleared the bay Quiros with the Capitana his own ship shaped his course to the N E and after suffering the greatest hardships returned to New Spain while de Torres in the Almiranta and the Tender steered to the West and was as Captain Cook observes the first that sailed between New Holland and New Guinea  Quiros soon after his return presented a Memorial to Philip II of Spain in which he enumerates twentythree islands that he had discovered and among them three parts of the country called Australia del Espiritu Santo in which land were found the Bay of St Philip and St Jago and part of Vera Cruz where he remained with his ships thirtysix days  In this Memorial Quiros supposes the above three parts to be one great country and to strengthen his conjecture relates the declaration of Pedro the Indian whom they seized at Tanmaco and carried to New Spain There Pedro declared in the presence of the Marquis of Montesclaros that he was a native of the Island Chicayana larger than that of Taumaco where he was found that from one to the other is four days sail of their vessels that Chicayana is low land very abundant in fruit that the natives of it are of his good Indian colour with long lank hair and punctuate as he was a little in the face arms and breast and that there were also white people in it who have their hair red and very long  with mulattoes whose hair is not curled nor quite strait  "He further said that from the island of Taumaco at three days sail and at two from Chicayana there is another island larger than the two abovementioned which is called Guaytopo and that all the three islands are friends and of one language that he was at Taumaco when a ship arrived there with only seven men who were very white except one who was brown and three women white and beautiful as Spanish who had their hair red and very long and that all three came covered from head to foot with a kind of veil blue or black and very fine to which they gave the name of Foafoa and that these ten persons were all who remained alive of forty the rest having died of hunger and thirst He also had seen come to his Island Chicayana another ship of two hulls full of people white and beautiful and with many very handsome girls and counting on his fingers by ten and ten he intimated they were in all persons  "He farther said that from another island called Tucopia at the distance of five days of their sailing is that great country inhabited by many people duncoloured and mulattoes in large towns that they were friendly and did not eat human flesh nor could their languages be understood that it was a country of very high mountains and large rivers and that to go from the island of Tucopia to that country when the sun rises they keep it on the left hand which must be from south towards southeast"  From the evidence of this man and what himself saw Quiros concludes that there were only two large portions of the earth severed from Europe Africa and Asia The first is America  which CHRISTOPHER COLON Columbus discovered the second and last is that which he had seen and solicited to people and completely to discover to the King  Upon the authority of this Memorial and others to the like purport presented by Quiros to Philip III of Spain future geographers grounded their opinion of the reality of a Southern Continent to the discovery of which that vain Navigator boldly asserted an undoubted claim  "The magnitude of the countries newly discovered"  says he to his Sovereign  "by what I saw is as much as that of all Europe Asia Minor the Caspian Sea and Persia with all the Mediterranean included"  That an assertion like this should gain credit at a time when nearly one quarter of the globe lay undiscovered is not to be wondered but that a man could be found upon such slender ground as the discovery of a few insignificant islands lying as it has lately appeared within the narrow limits of or degrees of latitude and less of longitude to impose upon an enlightened Prince and engage the attention of men of science in every country throughout the globe is matter of astonishment which like other mysteries when they come to be disclosed surprise only by their insignificance  But there are some who pretend in justification of Quiros that in his return to Spain he had seen that vast portion of land which Tasman afterwards discovered and which is now known by the name of New Holland and Capt Cook admits that one of the islands which Quiros touched at might be New Britain this conjecture does not seem destitute of probability Be this as it may to the object which Quiros had pointed whether real or imaginary every maritime power cast a jealous eye No sooner was France apprised of  the intentions of the British Court to engage in earnest in the business of this discovery than she sent a Navigator of her own to pursue the same track who was soon after followed by another on the part of Spain As the success which attended these first enterprises by no means answered the expectations of those by whom they were set on foot the two latter courts who had profit only for their object relinquished the project when they found themselves engaged in a hopeless pursuit The perseverance of our amiable Sovereign in the prosecution of his liberal designs as it has enlightened so it has inspired every lover of science at home and abroad with a reverential regard for his princely virtues in promoting and patronising useful arts But to return from this digression  In George Spitzbergen with a strong squadron of Dutch ships passed the Straits of Magellan and after cruizing for some time with various success against the Spaniards set sail from Port Nativity on the coast of Peru on his return home In his passage in deg of north lat and about long from the continent he discovered a mighty rock and three days after a new island with five hills neither of which have since been seen The first land he made was the Ladrones already described  In  Schouten  and  Le Maire  in the Unity of tons and the Hoorn of sailed from the Texel on the th of June professedly for the discovery of a new passage to the South Seas The subjects of the States of Holland being prohibited by an exclusive charter granted to their EastIndia Company from trading either to the eastward by the Cape of Good Hope or to the westward by the Magellanic Straits some private merchants considering this prohibition as an  encroachment on their liberty determined if possible to defeat the purpose of the charter and to trade to the southern countries by a track never before attempted With this view they fitted out the ships already mentioned one of which the Hoorn was burnt in careening at King's Island on the coast of Brazil and the other left fingly to pursue her voyage Having saved what stores they could rescue from the flames they proceeded on their voyage directing their course to the southwest till in lat ° ′ they came in sight of an opening to which having happily passed it they gave the name of  Strait le Maire  in compliment to the principal projector of the voyage though that honour was certainly due to Schouten who had the direction of the voyage Having soon after weathered the southernmost point of the American continent they called that promontory Cape Horne or more properly Hoorn after the town in Holland where the enterprize was first secretly concerted and two islands which they had passed they named Barnevelt Isles They had no sooner cleared the land than they changed their course to the northward with a view to make some stay at Juan Fernandes to refit but finding both that and the island of Massafuera inaccessible by reason of the great swell they were obliged to continue their voyage till a more favourable opportunity should offer to refresh the crew The first land they made was a small low island in lat ° ′ long ° ′ W which afforded them no refreshment except a scanty portion of scurvygrass but no water They named this Dog Island from a singular circumstance of finding in it dumb dogs that could neither bark nor snarl About seven degrees further west they fell in with another island which they called  Sondre Ground  because  they sounded but found no bottom Still continuing their course to the westward they came to an island to which they gave the name of  Waterland  as it afforded them a fresh supply of water of which they stood in much need They likewise procured plenty of fresh herbs but not being able to come to an anchor they kept their course and soon came in sight of a fourth island in which they could perceive a stream of water but like the other islands which they had passed it seemed difficult of access They hoisted out their boat and filled it with empty casks but instead of water their people returned covered with insects which though not so large as musketoes were by their numbers and their venom more troublesome Such swarms came from the shore as covered the ship as with a case and it was more than three days before the crew could free themselves and the vessel from these tormentors This they named  Fly Island    In their course from this island an incident happened that is a reproach to humanity an Indian bark fell in their way to which instead of making signals of peace to conciliate the crew they fired a gun to bring them to The bark was full of people male and female who frighted at the report instead of guessing the intent hastened to make their escape Presently the pinnace was hoisted out manned and a pursuit commenced the unhappy Indians finding it in vain to contend several being wounded by being fire at in their flight rather chose to perish in the ocean than trust to the mercy of their pursuers Most of the men just as the Dutchmen were about to board their vessel jumped into the sea and with them they took their provisions those who remained chiefly women and children and such as were  wounded submitted and were kindly used had their wounds dressed and restored to their bark but surely nothing could excuse the brutal proceedings at the first onset nor compensate for the lives of the innocent sufferers  Cocos  and  Traitors Islands  were the next they fell in with in their run from Fly Island These were adjoining islands and seemed to be composed of one people and by joining cordially together to revenge the death of their unfortunate friends they appear to have been of one mind The Voyagers now began to feel distress and to repent of their rash adventure they held a consultation in what manner to proceed being in want of almost every necessary Fortune however did more in their favour than their own prowess for after having passed the Island of  Hope  so called to express their feelings where they were very roughly received by the inhabitants they arrived at a most delightful island abounding with every blessing that nature could bestow and inhabited by a people who seemed sensible of their own happy state and ready to share it with those who were in want of the good things which they themselves possessed These they generously bestowed even to profusion Here the Voyagers refitted their ships recovered their sick recruited their almost exhausted stock of provisions by a plentiful supply of hogs and with as large quantities of the delicious fruits with which the island was stored as they could conveniently carry away This proving a second home to them they gave it the name of  Hoorn Island  for the reason already assigned It is situate in lat ° ′ long ° ′ east and in every respect resembles the island of Otaheite except in its naval strength in which there is no competition  Being now plentifully supplied and the crew in high health and having no hope of discovering the Continent of which they came in search they determined to return home by the nearest track accordingly they altered their course to the northwest till they approached the line and passing many islands to which they gave names as appearances or circumstances presented as Green Island St John's Island c they coasted the north side of New Britain and arrived at Bantam in the EastIndies where their ship was seized and their cargo confiscated at the instance of the Dutch EastIndia Company under pretence of being engaged in contraband trade It is remarkable that hitherto they had only lost four men one of whom died on their landing  In Prince Maurice and the States of Holland fitted out a fleet to distress the Spaniards in the South Seas and gave the command to Jaques Hermite but as these returned by a direct course from Lima to the Ladrones without making any discoveries in what is called the Pacific Sea it would be foreign to the design of this Introduction to detain the reader by an unnecessary digression  In Abel Tasman sailed from Batavia in the Heemskirk accompanied by the Zee Haan pink with a professed design of discovering the southern continent He directed his course to the Mauritius and from thence steering to the southward the first land he made was the eastern point of New Holland since known by the name of Van Dieman's Land in lat ° ′ long ° ′ E In this high latitude he proceeded to the eastward till he fell in with the westernmost coast of New Zealand where the greatest part of the boat's crew of the Zee Haan were murdered by  the savages in a bay to which he gave the name of  Murderer's Bay  now better known by that of Charlotte's Sound so called by our late Navigators From Murderer's Bay he steered W N W till he arrived at Three Kings Island between which and the main land he passed and run to the eastward as far as the th degree of east longitude then turning to the northward till he came into the th degree of southern latitude he veered again to the westward with a design to reach Hoorn Island discovered by Schouten in order to refit his ship and refresh his men But in his passage he fell in with the isles of Pylstaert Amsterdam Middleburg and Rotterdam at the latter of which islands he found every accommodation which he expected to meet with at Hoorn Island and embraced the opportunity that then presented of supplying his wants This necessary end accomplished he relinquished his design of visiting Traitor's and Hoorn Islands and directing his course to the N W discovered or small islands in lat ° ′ and long ° ′ to which he gave the name of Prince William's Islands and Hemskirk's Banks From thence he pursued his course to New Guinea without either discovering the continent he sought or visiting the Solomon Isles which at that time were judged the key to the grand discovery Thus leaving the whole in the same state of uncertainty as before Tasman returned to Batavia on the th of June  In Dampier passed the Magellanic Straits but in his return sailed miles in lat ° N without seeing fish fowl or any living creature but what they had on board  Next to him succeeded in Capt Cowley who sailed from Virginia to the South Sea but made no discoveries after he left the western  coasts of America returning by the old track to the EastIndies  In Dampier made a voyage professedly on discovery which was chiefly confined to New Holland New Guinea New Britain to which he gave name and the islands adjacent His discoveries were of infinite importance but as New Holland was the chief object of enquiry they do not properly come within the limits of our review  In Dampier made a third voyage to the South Seas but without making any new discoveries He was accompanied in this voyage by Mr Funnel to whom the circumnavigation of the globe is ascribed  In the Duke and Duchess sailed from Bristol to the South Seas but returned as all the Freebooters did by the common track  In Capt Clipperton passed the Straits with a view to enrich his owners by the spoils of the Spaniards He returned likewise through the Ladrone Islands consequently could make no discoveries in the Pacific Seas  In the Dutch EastIndia Company at the instance of Capt Roggewein fitted out a respectable fleet for the diseovery of that continent which lay hitherto undiscovered though universally believed to exist Three stout ships were appointed and well provided with every thing necessary for this service the Eagle of guns and men on board of which embarked Roggewein as Commodore having under him Capt Coster an experienced navigator the Tienhoven of guns and men of which Capt Bowman was commander and the African Galley commanded by Capt Rosenthall From this voyage every thing was hoped The equipment of the ships the appointment of the commanders and  above all the hereditary zeal of the Commodore which he inherited from his father for the service all contributed to raise the expectations of Europe to the highest pitch Before they arrived at the Straits of Magellan they had encountered the most boisterous seas and endured the most intolerable hardships that ever ships resisted They had no sooner entered the Straits than they were again attacked by tempestuous weather This storm was scarce abated when they were alarmed by the sight of a vessel which they took either for a pirate or a Spanish ship of war and as she seemed to approach very fast they were preparing for an engagement when to their agreeable surprize they discovered it to be the Tienhoven's shallop on board of which was Capt Bowman who had been separated three months before and it was concluded had been engulphed in the hurricane that happened when the Tienhoven lost her maintop and mizenmasts and the Eagle her mainsailyard They mutually rejoiced at each other's escape Capt Bowman thought his associates had perished in the storm and they had given him over for lost But their joy was of short continuance they had other dangers to encounter and other hardships to undergo they found the Magellanic Straits impracticable and entered the Southern Ocean with difficulty by Strait le Maire After recruiting their water at the Isles of Fernandez their first attempt was in search of Davis's Land which it was imagined from the description given by the discoverer would prove an Index to the continent of which they were in search They missed it where they expected to find it but accident threw it in their way It proved a small island which they thought a new discovery and because they fell in with it on Easterday they called  it  Pasch  or  EasterIsland  We have just to remark of this island that as it was then full of people and but few seen when last explored and among them only FIFTEEN women it is more than probable that in less than another century this remote and barren island will be wholly depopulated From this island Roggewein pursued nearly the same track with that which Schouten had pointed out till veering more to the north he fell in with the islands at which Commodore Byron first landed and where some of the wreck of the African Galley was actually found Here five of the crew deserted and were left behind and it would have been an object of curious enquiry for the Naturalists who accompanied the Commodore in his voyage to have endeavoured to trace a similitude of European features among the inhabitants of George's Island as there is reason to believe  that  to be the island on which the five Dutchmen chose to fix their residence This island which they place in the th degree of southern latitude they named Mischievous Island owing to their late disaster of which a particular account is given in the third volume of this collection  Eight leagues to the west of this island they discovered another to which they gave the name of Aurora from its splendid appearance gilded by the rays of the rising sun Another island discovered in the evening of the same day they called  Vesper  Pursuing their course to the westward they discovered a cluster of islands undoubtedly the same now called the  Great Cyclades  to which they gave the name of the Labyrinth because it was with difficulty they could clear them  In a very few days sail after passing the Labyrinth they came in sight of a pleasant island to which from its fair appearance they gave the  name of the  Island of Recreation  They were at first hospitably received but in the end the natives endeavoured to surprize them by stratagem and to cut them off They had supplied the strangers with provisions water and wood and had assisted them in collecting greens and in conveying them to the ships but one day seeing a party of them unarmed and walking carelesly in the fields charmed with the delights of the country in a moment some thousands of the natives rushed suddenly upon them and with showers of stones began an assault The Dutch from the ships observing a tumult and suspecting the worst came hastily to the assistance of their comrades when a general engagement ensued in which many natives were shot dead some of the Dutchmen killed and not a few wounded This proved baneful to the voyage Few of the crews of either ship after this could be prevailed on to venture on shore for provisions most of them became discontented and some mutinous It was therefore concluded at a general council of officers to continue their course towards New Britain and New Guinea and thence by the way of the Moluccas to the East Indies which was accordingly carried into execution and thus ended like all the former a voyage which was expected at least to have solved the question concerning the existence or nonexistence of a new continent but in fact it determined nothing They who argued from the harmony that is observable in the works of Nature insisted that something was wanting to give one side of the globe an equipoise to the other while those who reasoned from experience pronounced this ideal system the mere creature of fanciful speculation  In Lozier Bouvet was sent by the French EastIndia Company upon discovery in the South  Atlantic Ocean He sailed from Port L'Orient on the th of July on board the Eagle accompanied by the Mary and on the st of January following he discovered or thought he discovered land in lat ° S Long from Paris ′ East But this land being diligently sought for by Capt Cook in his voyage for the discovery of the Southern Continent in without effect there is reason to doubt if any such land exists or if it does it is too remote from any known track to be of use to trade or navigation  This discovery has however been much insisted on by M Le Mercier in a paper published by that celebrated Geographer in the Memoirs of the French Academy for which has given rise to a very able defence of Capt Cook's Journal by Mr Wales who accompanied Capt Cook in his research for the land in question but as the discovery itself can be no manner of use either to geography or navigation we shall pass it over with only noticing that the observations made by Mr Wales independent of the discovery are such as every navigator should be master of This defence is printed in the introduction to Capt Cook's Journal now published by authority and is well worth preserving But to return from this digression  Bouvet pursued his course to the eastward in a high latitude about ° of longitude farther when in lat ° south the two ships parted one going to the island of Mauritius the other returning to France  In Commodore Anson traversed the Great Pacific Ocean but his business being war he made no discoveries within the limits of our review and his story is too well known to need recapitulation  Come we now to the aera when his Majesty formed the design of making discoveries and exploring the Southern Hemisphere and when in the year he directed it to be carried into execution  "Accordingly Commodore Byron having under his command the Dolphin and Tamar sailed from the Downs on the st of June the same year and having visited the Falkland Islands passed through the Straits of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean where he discovered the Islands of Diappointment George's Prince of Wales's the Isles of Danger York and Byron's Islands He returned to England the th of May  "And in the month of August following the Dolphin was again sent out under the command of Capt Wallis with the Swallow commanded by Capt Carteret  "They proceeded together till they came to the west end of the Straits of Magellan and in sight of the Great South Sea where they were separated  "Capt Wallis directed his course more westerly than any Navigator had done before him in so high a latitude but met with no land till he got within the Tropic where he discovered the islands Whitsunday Queen Charlotte Egmont Duke of Gloucester Duke of Cumberland Maitea Otaheite Eimeo Tapamanou Howe Scilly Boscawen Keppel and Wallis and returned to England May  "His companion Capt Carteret kept a different route in which he discovered the islands Osnaburgh Gloucester Queen Charlotte's Isles Carteret's Gower's and the Strait between New Britain and New Ireland which though undoubtedly  discovered by Dampier before has been celebrated as a new discovery of vast importance to navigation He returned to England in  We are told in the introduction to the voyage just published that the voyages of the above Navigators  "were principally confined to a favourite object of discovery in the South Atlantic Ocean"  for which we can find no other ground than that of Commodore Byron's return from the Straits of Magellan in search of Pepys now called Falkland's Island  "In November Commodore Bougainville sailed from France in the frigate La Boudeuse with the storeship l'Etoile After spending some time on the coast of Brazil and at Falkland's Islands he got into the Pacific Sea by the Straits of Magellan January  "In this Ocean he discovered the four Facardines the Isle of Lanciers and Harpe Island the same afterwards named by Cook Lagoon Island Thrum Cap and Bow Island About twenty leagues farther to the west he discovered four other islands afterwards fell in with Maitea Otaheite Isles of Navigators and Forlorn Hope which to him were new discoveries He then passed through between the Hebrides which he calls the Great Cyclades first discovered by Roggewein discovered the Shoal of Diana and some others the land of Cape Deliverance several islands more to the north passed to the north of New Ireland which by the way he could not have done by any other course than thro' what is now called the Endeavour's Straits touched at Batavia and arrived in France in March  "In the Spaniards sent a ship to trace the discoveries of the English and French This ship touched at Easter Island and arrived at Otaheite  in In her return she discovered some islands in lat S and long W but whether she bent her course to New or Old Spain remains undecided  "In the French fitted out another ship from the Mauritius under the command of Capt Kergulen who having discovered some barren islands between the Cape of Good Hope and Van Dieman's Land contented himself with leaving some Memorials there which were found by Capt Cook in the voyage of which we are now about to give an account  "This year was rendered remarkable by the Transit of the Planet Venus over the Sun's Disk a phaenomenon of great importance to Astronomy and which every where engaged the attention of the learned in that Science  "In the beginning of the year the Royal Society presented a Memorial to his Majesty setting forth the advantages to be derived from accurate observations of this Transit in different parts of the world particularly from a set of such observations made in a southern latitude between the th and th degrees of longitude west from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich at the same time representing that vessels properly equipped would be necessary to convey the observers to their destined stations but that the Society were in no condition to defray the expence"  In consequence of this Memorial the Admiralty were directed by his Majesty to provide proper vessels for that purpose and the Endeavour bark was accordingly purchased fitted out and the command given to Capt Cook who had already signalized himself as an experienced Navigator and Mr Charles Green the Astronomer  was jointly with the Captain appointed to make the observations  Otaheite being the island preferred for the performance of that important service Capt Cook received orders to proceed directly and his instructions were as soon as the astronomical observations were completed to prosecute the design of making discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean as far as the th degree of south latitude and then if no land should be discovered to shape his course between lat and till he should fall in with New Zealand which he was to explore and thence to return  In the prosecution of these instructions he sailed from Plymouth on the th of August and on the th of April following arrived at Otaheite having in his way discovered Lagoon Island Two Groups Bird Island and Chain Island  At Otaheite he remained three months and besides the Astronomer Mr Green being accompanied by Mr Banks a gentleman of fortune and Dr Solander one of the Librarians of the British Museum eminent both for his knowledge in Natural History and in Botany we have only to remark that all Europe has already been benefited by the employment of their time  The observations on the Transit being compleated with the wisht for success Capt Cook proceeded on discovery he visited the SocietyIsles and discovered Oheteroa fell in with the eastern coast of New Zealand and examined it thence proceeding to New Holland he surveyed the eastern side of that vast continent which had never before bene explored discovered the Strait between its northern extremity and New Guinea and returning home by Savu Batavia the Cape of  Good Hope and St Helena he arrived in England the th of July  In Captain Surville made a trading voyage from some port in the East Indies by a new course He passed near New Britain and fell in with some land in lat ° south long ° East to which he gave his own name then shaping his course to the southeastward narrowly missed New Caledonia put into Doubtful Bay in New Zealand and from thence steered to the east between the latitudes of and ° south till he arrived on the coast of America a course never before navigated and with that pursued by Capt Furneaux between and ° and that afterwards by Capt Cook in a still higher latitude confirms to demonstration the nonexistence of a southern continent  No sooner was Capt Cook's voyage compleated and his Journals examined than another voyage was projected the chief object of which was to compleat the discovery of the Southern Hemisphere Very extraordinary preparations were made for the equipment of the ships for this voyage which required those of a particular construction to perform itsuch therefore were purchased Some alterations likewise were necessary in the species of provisions usual in the navy and these were made Add to this that many extra articles were provided such as malt sour krout salted cabbage portable soup saloup mustard marmalade and several others as well for food for convalescents as physick for the sick  The ships judged most proper for the voyage were built for colliers two of which were fitted up and the command given to Capt Cook the largest of tons called the Resolution had  men officers included the other the Adventure of tons given to Capt Furneaux d in command had only To these were added persons well skilled in Natural History Astronomy Mathematics and the liberal Arts of Painting Drawing c c  On the th of July the two ships sailed from Plymouth after having settled the latitude and longitude of that port by observation This they did in order to regulate the timepieces of which they had four on board three made by Mr Arnold and one by Mr Kendal on Mr Harrison's principles  The great object of the voyage was to determine to a certainty the existence or nonexistence of a southern continent which till then as has already been related had engaged the attention of most of the maritime powers and about the reality of which Geographers of late seemed to have had but one belief  Let it suffice that this question is at length decided but before we enter upon the proofs necessary to decide that other question concerning the existence or nonexistence of a N W or N E passage it will be expected that we should not only lay before the reader the facts that have appeared in the course of the voyages made in the Pacific Ocean which we are now about to relate but those also that are to be gathered from the voyage made in the Atlantic Ocean for the like purpose  Not only Navigators the most celebrated in their time but even philosophers and cosmographers of the first eminence have contended from analogy that a communication between the Atlantic and Great Pacific Ocean must exist somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere in like manner  as the same exists by the Straits of Magellan in the Southern Hemisphere this appeared so certain to the Cabbots the most renowned Navigators of the th century that the younger Sebastian at the risque of life proposed the discovery of that passage to Henry the VIIth and though he failed by the mutiny of his crew after he had sailed as high as the th degree of northern latitude yet that prince was so well pleased with his endeavours that he created a new office in his favour and appointed him grand pilot of England with a salary of a year during life  He returned by the way of Newfoundland bringing home with him two Esquimaux  It was long however before a second attempt was made with the professed design of discovering a northwest passage The attention of the nation was too much fixed on projects towards the south to attend to any thing that had reference to enterprizes in the north  Some there were however who held the object in view and in Sir Martin Forbisher with two small ships attempted the discovery and having found a Strait on the southernmost point of Groenland through which he sailed about fifty leagues with high land on both sides he persuaded himself that he had succeeded in his enterprize but after repeated trials finding his error he gave over the search  In a few years after Sir Martin Sir Humphrey Gilbert renewed the hopes of the discovery by a voyage to the north which though it failed in the main point it proved of infinite advantage to the nation in another He coasted along the American Continent from the th degree of northern latitude till he fell in with the Gulph of St Lawrence which he continued to navigate till he perceived  the water to freshen he then took possession of that vast continent since called Canada by the French in the name of his Sovereign and was the first who projected the fishery in Newfoundland and who promoted the establishment of it  In proportion as the commerce to the east inceased and became lucrative the desire of engrossing the trade by shortening the passage thither increased also thence arose an emulation among the merchants for discovering the passage of which we are speaking Those in London had concerted a plan for that purpose and those in the West Country had a similar plan in contemplation but neither the one nor the other had managed their designs with so much secrecy but that each got acquainted with the other's intentions This produced a coalition both agreed to join in the expence and both agreed in the appointment of Capt John Davis to conduct the voyage  In he embarked on board the Sunshire a bark of about tons and men attended by a vessel of tons with men to which he gave the name of the Moonshine He sailed from Dartmouth on the th of May The first land he made was an island near the southernmost point of Groenland which from its horrid appearance he named the Island of Desolation In this progress he passed the Strait that still bears his name and advanced as high as the latitude of in an open sea the coasts of which he examined till the approach of winter obliged him to return with every hope however of succeeding another year On his arrival his employers were so well pleased with the relation he gave and the progress he had made that they next year augmented his force and sent him out with four vessels one of which the Mermaid of tons burthen he commanded  himself and the other three the Sunshine Moonshine and the Northstar a pinance of tons only were furnished with masters of his own recommendation  On the th of May he set sail from Dartmouth and steered a strait course till he arrived in the th degree of latitude when he divided his fleet ordering the Sunshine and Northstar to direct their search to the northeastward as far as the th degree N while he with the Mermaid and Moonshine should continue their former search to the N W where he had already contracted an acquaintance with the inhabitants in his former voyage which he vainly hoped would facilitate his views At first they expressed great joy at his return but they soon discovered the cloven foot They were fond of iron and he gave them knives knives did not content them they wanted hatchets when they got hatchets they cut his cables and stole one of his coasting anchors which he never recovered He took one of the ringleaders prisoner who after some time proved a useful hand but they in return surprized five of his men of whom they killed two grievously wounded two more and the fifth made his escape by swimming to the ship with an arrow sticking in his arm In this voyage he coasted the land which he found to be an island from the th to the th degree N and at length anchored in a fair harbour eight leagues to the northward of which he conceived the passage to lie as a mighty sea was seen rushing between two headlands from the west into this sea he ardently wished to have sailed but the wind and current both opposing his design he was obliged by the remonstrances of his people to relinquish that savage coast and as the season was far advanced to return home When he arrived he  met with the Sunshine but the Northstar was never more seen  His misfortunes did not abate his zeal He was prepossessed with the certainty of a N W passage and he prevailed upon other adventurers in conjunction with some of his former friends to enable him to make a third trial which proved no less unfortunate than those he had attempted before notwithstanding which could he have raised friends to have defrayed the expence he would have continued his researches till death had put an end to his labours  These repeated disappointments threw a damp for a while on this favourite pursuit and it was not till the year that the former spirit of discovery began to revive  In that year Mr Henry Hudson projected a new course towards the N W which brought him to the mouth of the Strait that now bears his name This he traced till he came into an open sea but the season being past for making any farther progress at that time he prevailed upon his crew by flattering their avarice with the certainty of gain to winter on that inhospitable coast though destitute of provisions for a single month While their provisions lasted they were contented and the tale of riches and glory that had been told them cherished their hopes but when famine and cold began to pinch the ideal prospect vanished and nothing but murmuring and mutiny succeeded which ended in the tragical death of the Captain and seven of his sick followers who unable to make resistance were set adrift in the boat while those who were in better health seized the ship and made the best of their way home and on their return gave such an account of the  certainty of the passage as left no room to doubt of the discovery  Accordingly the very next year Sir Henry Button undertook the task and steered directly to the newdiscovered sea in which he sailed more than leagues farther to the S W than his predecessors wintered at Port Nelson where he lost near half his men and returned the next year roundly asserting the existence of the passage though he had not been so happy as to find it  Sir Henry was scarce returned before James Hall and William Baffin set sail with a view to share the honour of compleating the discovery  In this attempt Hall fell by the hands of a savage and Baffin soon returned but with a full design to renew his pursuit whenever he could find an opportunity so to do This did not happen till the year when he examined the sea that communicates with Davis's Straits which he found to be no other than a great bay with an inlet from the north to which he gave the name of Smith's Sound in lat  About this time the Hudson's Bay Company was established who by charter were obliged to prosecute this discovery as were likewise those masters of vessels that were employed in the whale fishery but neither the one nor the other paid much attention to the chief object of their establishment  In the year Luke Fox commissioned by King Charles the First made a voyage in search of the same passage but to as little purpose as the rest  He was followed by Capt James who after the most elaborate search from one extremity to  the other of the bay changed his opinion and declared that no such passage existed and it was not till a hundred years after that Capt Middleton undertook upon the most plausible grounds and at the instance and by the recommendation of Arthur Dobbs  Esq  to make another attempt which though it was performed with equal zeal and fidelity and though it might have carried conviction home to the mind of every unprejudiced person yet as it was unsuccessful it proved unsatisfactory Mr Dobbs who had persuaded himself that such a passage must exist somewhere from a friend became a most implacable enemy charging Capt Middleton not only with want of will but with want of honesty and with a predetermined design of defeating the purpose of the voyage being influenced thereto by the Hudson's Bay Company from whom he insinuated the Captain had received a pecuniary reward  Though this was equally injurious to the character of Capt Middleton and to the honour of the Company yet Mr Dobbs was in such high estimation with the public who are ever prone to favour that side on which their interest is depending that he not only procured an Act of Parliament so framed as to facilitate his views but had interest enough with a society of private adventurers to fit out two ships the Dobbs and California to reexamine the coasts which Capt Middleton had visited and to make farther researches till they should discover the passage which it was most confidently asserted must necessarily exist and which when discovered would enrich the discoverers and immensely increase the wealth and commerce of the nation  As the act which was obtained for the purpose of this voyage was almost universally condemned  as illiberal partial and inadequate the reward of twenty thousand pounds held forth by it being confined to ships belonging to his Mejesty's  subjects solely  by which not only those of all other nations were excluded but even those belonging to his Majesty's navy placed in the same predicament and what was thought still more reprehensible it was soon discovered that this act which openly professed to give encouragement of ALL his Majesty's subjects to make search for the passage in question was yet confined to such ships solely as should discover it through  Hudson's Bay    With all this reward to enliven and invigorate the pursuit which at the same time that it threw a damp on other adventurers could not but reanimate the hopes of those who were immediately engaged in the enterprize the two ships set sail and having examined every inlet every gulph and every opening which had the least appearance of a navigable Strait they returned as all that had gone before them had done with a lamentable story of the distresses they had suffered and the dangers they had surmounted but not yet fully convinced that the passage which they went in search of did not exist  Mr Dobbs though less sanguine but not less dissatisfied with those entrusted with the conduct of this voyage than with that of their predecessors was still so immoveably attached to his own conceit that he died in the firm belief that every miscarriage that had happened had originated through the management of the Hudson's Bay Company But the Hudson's Bay Company very prudentially kept proofs in their own hands that had they been called upon by Parliament to account for their conduct would have convinced the world how unjustly they had been aspersed and  how fully they had complied in every respect with the terms of their institution  The clamour however which Mr Dobbs and the gentlemen interested in the success of the voyage had found means to raise against the Company was such as no longer to be disregarded Though they were convinced themselves that no such passage existed within the limits of their charter yet they found it necessary to convince the nation likewise They therefore about the year ordered a sloop to be built for the sole purpose of reexploring every inlet that had been left doubtful but more particularly that called Chesterfield's Inlet which Mr Ellis who wrote the history of the voyage had spoken of as NOT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF PROBABILITY The command of this sloop named the Churchill was entrusted to Capt Christopher who executed his commission to the satisfaction of his employers but not having compleated his examination so as to leave no possibility of any such Strait existing the Company the year following added to the sloop which Capt Christopher commanded a Cutter of which Mr Norton was appointed master and both set sail for Chesterfield's Inlet the extent of which the Captain in his former voyage and not been able wholly to ascertain  Early in the summer of these two vessels set sail from Churchill River and arrived at the mouth of Chesterfield's Inlet in the proper season and notwithstanding the opposition they met with from the difficulty of the navigation and from the obstructions of the shoals of ice they had to combat they reached the extremity of the gulph and found it to terminate in a vast lake more than sixty miles in extent into which a river of ordinary  size which took its rise among the mountains after several falls emptied itself  Thus having traced to their source this and every opening as far as the th degree of northern latitude beyond which no communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Seas could be of any use for the purposes of commerce the Company relinquished upon the most solid grounds all farther search for it be sea but that no imputation should remain upon the Company for not fulfilling their engagements with the public in the amplest manner Mr Dobbs having laid great stress on what the Indians who came from far to trade with the Company had said of a river which from the abundance of copper being found near it had obtained the name of the Copper Mine River wrote to the Governor of Fort Prince of Wales to send a proper person under the convoy of some trusty Indians to make an accurate survey of that famous river and to trace it from its source to the sea  Mr Hearne a young gentleman of known courage and equally well qualified in every other respect was made choice of for this enterprise Accordingly he set out with his Indian convoy from Fort Prince of Wales on Churchill's River in lat ° ′ on the th of December and directing his course to the N W over one of the most dreary and desolate portions of the earth that any European ever crossed he arrived the June following at a place called Congecathawhachaga where he had two good observations by which he was enabled to determine the latitude of the place to be ° ′ N and by computation in longitude ° ′ west of Churchill River  On the th of July still continuing his course to the W of the N he reached the head of the  Copper Mine River which instead of being navigable for shipping was at this place scarcely practicable for an Indian canoe  Here however Mr Hearne began his survey previous to which three of his convoy were dispatched as scouts to gain intelligence if there were any Esquimaux about the river These scouts in a few days returned with an account that there were five huts of Esquimaux on the opposite side and as they judged at about twelve miles distance On this news the Indian convoy paid no more attention to Mr Hearne's survey their whole thoughts being occupied in what manner to steal upon the Esquimaux in the night and to murder them while they were asleep The better to effect their bloody purpose it was necessary to cross the river but before they made the least advance they cleaned their arms loaded their guns and new painted their targets some with the image of the sun others with that of the moon others with different kinds of birds and beasts of prey but most with the figures of furies monsters daemons and other visionary inhabitants of the different elements of earth air and sea Upon enquiry into the reason of this superstition Mr Hearne was told that each man painted on his target the figure of that being on which he most relied for success or protection  This ceremony over they began their march to the huts of the Esquimaux always keeping the low grounds and carefully avoiding the eminences The number of the party that accompanied Mr Hearne being superior to that of the Esquimaux and much better equipped could scarcely have failed of rendering victory certain had the attack been made in fair combat but on that they did not wholly rely Being arrived within yards  of the huts undiscovered they then halted and endeavoured to persuade Mr Hearne to remain stationary till the fight was over but that gentleman apprehending more danger from being left alone than by accompanying his convoy resolved to share with them the fortune of the day They seemed highly pleased with this instance of his courage and presently put into his hands a spear and a poniard but he had no target By the time that all things were agreed upon and adjusted it was one in the morning and all the unsuspecting Esquimaux were fast asleep it was then they rushed sorth upon them and with dreadful yells began the horrors of the massacre Being in a situation incapable of resistance men women and children fell victims to savage fury The shrieks and groans of the poor expiring multitude were truly horrible to a feeling heart and this was much increased in that of Mr Hearne by the sight of a young girl who being pierced with a spear fell down at his feet and twisted round his legs in such a manner as hardly to be disengaged from her dying grasps Her Mr Hearne solicited to save but the two ruffians who pursued her made no reply till their spears had transfixed her to the earth and then looking sternly at him they asked him with a tone that denoted fury if he was in want of an Esquimaux wife He at that instant had fears for his own life for begging her's and while she was wreathing round their spears in all the agonies of torturehorrible to tellHere Mr Hearne in his journal throws a veil over the inhuman and more than brutal scene as too shocking for description  When they had compleated their dreadful carnage they discovered on the opposite side of the river seven other huts which the projecting cliffs  had hitherto concealed from their sight These they reconnoitred and seeing the Esquimaux inhabitants packing up their baggage and preparing for action but seemingly not very apprehensive from any attack to intimidate them they began to fire upon them across the river which was here about eighty yards wide The Esquimaux who had never before heard the report of a gun were seen eagerly gathering up the bullets which the rocks had flattened till one man was wounded in the leg they then took the alarm fled to their canoes and made good their retreat to the shoals above The Indians who had now nothing to fear began to plunder the huts the inhabitants of which they had just murdered and having made themselves masters of as much copper as they could carry away they ascended a hill and forming a circle with their spears erect gave shouts of victory crying  Tama Tama  words of derision and defiance to the fugitives below  This ceremony over they returned to their baggage and recrossing the river to assist in the survey they observed the Esquimaux thinking they were gone busy again about their huts They rushed forward with astonishing impetuosity but the canoes of the Esquimaux being ready they had embarked and fled one man only remaining whom the Indians immediately slew They plundered the huts of what baggage was left destroyed them and then returned to Mr Hearne in joyful triumph  It was about five in the morning of the th of July when Mr Hearne proceeded again to survey the river which he found all the way into the sea encumbered with shoals and falls impracticable to navigation Being low water when he reached its mouth he could determine the rise of  the tide to be about or feet This rise on account of the falls could carry a vessel of burthen but a very little way nor did it slow far the water at eight miles distance having not the least brackish taste  By the time Mr Hearne had compleated his survey of the river it was about one in the morning of the th of August when the sun in those high latitudes is always a good height above the horizon It then came on a very thick fog with a drizzling rain and as he had found the river and sea in every respect unfit for commercial purposes he thought it unnecessary to wait for fair weather to determine the latitude to greater exactness than he was already enabled to do by the observations he had made at Congecathawhachaga by which he could calculate to minutes with certainty the latitude of the mouth of the Copper Mine River which he fixed at ° north and long W from Churchill River that is about W of Greenwich  In Mr Hearne's journey back from the Copper Mine River those who attended him met with an adventure that were it not reported on unquestionable authority could hardly be believed While they were out on a hunting party they very unexpectedly crossed a snowshoe track and tracing it till they came to a little hut they there found a young woman sitting alone whom they brought to the tents Being questioned as to her companions she positively declared that she was the only inhabitant within her knowledge Being questioned farther as to her history she gave the following account That she was one of the Western Dogribbed Indians who live afar off towards the setting sun that the tribe to which she belonged were surprized in the night by the Arathapescow  Indians and all murdered except herself and three other young women who were made prisoners that while the Arathapescow's were a hunting she found means to elope and had concealed herself in the hut in which she was found for many months that when she was first made prisoner she had a child whom the women took from her and killed it on the spot that she had lived in that solitude for more than nine moons without seeing a human face and that she had subsisted all the while by snaring hares squirrels and other wild animals which frequented the woods so that she was at no loss for food that she once had a mind to return to her own country but was deterred from attempting it by the distance it being many days journey to the westward and she had no conception left of the way She had nothing to make snares of but the sinews of rabbits legs and feet which she had found means to strip and had twisted them together for that purpose and of their skins she had made a neat and warm winter's clothing She had not been long at the tents before half a score Indians wrestled to see who should have her for wife Her country she said was so far off that she had never seen iron or other metal till taken prisoner those of her tribe making their hatchets and chissels of deers horns and their knives of stone and bone their arrows were shod with deers horns and their instruments to make their wood work were nothing but beavers teeth they frequently heard of the useful materials the nations to the east are supplied with from the English but instead of drawing nearer to be in the way of trading for ironwork were obliged to retreat farther back to avoid the Arathapescow Indians who make surprizing slaughter among them every year Her story though very  affecting having lost father mother brothers and relations all murdered in one night served the savages only for matter of mirth  But while the Hudson's Bay Company were thus employed there was yet another expedition recommended to his Majesty about the beginning of by the Royal Society the chief object of which was to try how far navigation was practicable under the Poles It was imagined that the sun being there degrees high about the middle of summer and having little or no depression towards the horizon might invigorate that part of the hemisphere with more heat than in our climate where in the winter he is only deg high and hours in every below the horizon in which space the earth has time to cool and to lose in the night the influence of heat it receives in the day This consideration added to the credit due to several wellauthenticated relations particularly about the year when it was asserted and believed that several Dutch ships had actually sailed under the Pole and the merchants in Holland being required to verify this fact having grounded a petition for an exclusive charter to trade to China and Japan by a northern passage upon it they produced the Journals of the Greenland squadron of in several of which there was notice taken of a ship which that year had sailed as high as the latitude of and three Journals of that ship being examined they all agreed as to one observation taken by the master August in ° ′ north where the sea was open and the weather warm  There were however several other important reasons which induced the Royal Society to recommend this northern voyage to his Majesty who having been graciously pleased to countenance  and encourage it Capt Phipps now Lord Mulgrave no sooner heard of the design than he tendered his service to carry it into execution The board of longitude at the same time agreed with Mr Israel Lyons a gentleman eminent in the science of Astronomy and an honour to the institution where he first received the rudiments of his education Christ's Hospital to accompany Mr Phipps in order to fix the true places of several northern promontories and for other nautical purposes and Dr Irving likewise embraced that opportunity to give the invention for which he had received a parliamentary reward a full trial  In this voyage too the Board of Longitude sent two timepieces for trial one constructed by Mr Kendall on Mr Harrison's principles the other by Mr Arnold on principles of his own and Capt Phipps had himself a pocket watch made by Mr Arnold by which he kept longitude with much greater exactness than was done by either of the other two having varied only min sec during the whole voyage  On the th of April Capt Phipps in the Race Horse received his commission and on the th of May was joined by Capt Lutwidge in the Carcase BombKetch at the Nore where Mr Lyons landed and found Sheerness fort to lie in lat ° ′ ″ long ′ E  On the th of June Capt Phipps delivered Mr Lutwidge his instructions weighed and proceeded on his voyage  On the th determined the position of Hang Cliff a remarkable point in the Shetland Isles lat ° ′ long ′ ″ west of Greenwich  On the th of the same month he found himself close in with the land of Spitsbergen in degrees North  On the d of July measured the altitude of several mountains One was yards high  On the th steered directly for Hackluyt's Headland  On the th being entangled in the ice and forced to haul up to weather a point set the foresails which with the breeze freshening gave the ship so much way that she pressed thro' it with a violent stroke  On the th the symptoms of an approaching storm obliged him to take shelter in Vogel Sang a small island the northeastermost point of which is known by the name of Cloven Cliff lat ° ′ long ° ′ ″ E Hackluyt's Headland ° ′ long ° ′ ″ E  On the th being in lat ° ′ and long ° ′ E the ice came all round the ships and pressed so close that the ships could no longer make sail yet the weather was fine and the crews full of play  But on the th of August the apprehensions of wintering in that situation began to increase and the sea being open to the westward the carpenters were set to work to enlarge the boats and to make them commodious to transport the crews As the ships drove and the water shoaled hourly the danger increased In the situation they were in had either the ice or the ships grounded inevitable destruction must have ensued  On the th the people were employed in hauling the boats over the ice At that critical moment the ice about the ships was observed to open  On the th those who were left on board pressed the ships as it were by main force through much heavy ice and about noon got out to sea  And on the th anchored in Smeerenburg harbour on the island of Spitsbergen where they found four Dutchmen at anchor on whom they had depended for a passage home had the ships been locked upThus ended this important voyage for far as related to discovery  Capt Phipps concludes the account of his voyage with observing that by setting out just at the proper season they not only reached the th degree of latitude without meeting any obstruction from the ice but they had likewise time sufficient to examine a track of icey coast between the latitudes of and extending more than degrees from W to E in which there did not exist the least opening to the North the whole being one continued wall of ice impassable by human art  All this being known to the Lords of the Admiralty it might seem an unnecessary expence to order any more ships to be fitted out to attempt so hopeless a discovery from the Atlantic Ocean yet to leave nothing untried other ships were fitted out and the command of the first the Lyon armed brig was given to Lieut Pickersgill with orders "to proceed to Davis's Straits first for the protection of the British whale fisheries and then that object secured to explore the coasts of Baffin's Bay as far as in his judgment the same could be done without apparent risk taking care to leave the said Bay so timely as to secure his return to England in the fall and it was further enjoined him to make such nautical remarks as would be useful to Geography and Navigation Pickersgill obeyed his instructions in these last instances He did make some useful observations and he did return the same year but the command of the next expedition into Baffin's Bay was conferred  on Lieut Young with orders to endeavour to find a passage on that side from the Atlantic to the Pacific Sea and if he succeeded in the attempt to make the best of his way to Spithead or the Nore there to remain till farther orders but neither Lieut Pickersgill nor Lieut Young having succeeded as in truth there could be no reasonable foundation for supposing they would succeed both these gentlemen suffered in their nautical characters the one for improper behaviour while he was commander the other as better adapted to contribute to the glory of a victory than to add to geographical discoveries  Such then has been the unfortunate issue of all the voyages which have been undertaken for the discovery of a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean but it was not yet rendered certain that a passage nearly approaching to the extremities of the Gulphs that had already been discovered on the eastern side of the American Continent might not be found on its western side as there is a remarkable note in Campbell's Voyages on which that writer who was a great advocate for the passage in question lays great stress viz that Capt Lancaster of the Dragon afterwards Sir James who commanded the first fleet to the East Indies having heard a report while there of another passage to that country and being on his return home overtaken by a storm in which the Dragon lost her rudder and was otherwise in danger of perishing being determined not to desert her wrote a letter and sent it on board the Hector to which was added the following P S  "The passage to the East Indies lies in ° ′ by the N W on the American side"  It was therefore to determine this question with certainty that our great Navigator relinquished  his honourable post of Governor of Greenwich Hospital to engage in the conduct of an expedition which necessarily exposed him to innumerable hardships and to dangers which unfortunately for his country it was not his lot to escape  The instructions under which he sailed if any credit may be given to public report were planned by himself and drawn up under his own immediate inspection And indeed whoever considers the vast objects they comprize the judicious arrangements of the course that was to be pursued and the various operations that were to be carried into effect will not hesitate a moment to pronounce that such a masterly composition could not be the work of an ifficial clerk let his talents and experience in nautical affairs be ever so extensive  That the intelligent reader may enjoy the pleasure of perusing them they are here inserted at full length  By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland c  Secret Instructions for Capt James Cook Commander of his Majesty's sloop the Resolution  WHEREAS the Earl of Sandwich has signified to us his Majesty's pleasure that an attempt should be made to find out a northern passage by sea from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean and whereas we have in pursuance thereof caused his Majesty's sloops Resolution and Discovery to be fitted in all respects proper to proceed upon a voyage for the purpose abovementioned and from the experience we have had of your abilities and good conduct in your voyages have thought fit to entrust you with the conduct of the present intended voyage and with that view appointed you to command  the firstmentioned sloop and directed Capt Clerke who commands the other to follow your orders for his further proceedings You are hereby required and directed to proceed with the said two sloops directly to the Cape of Good Hope unless you shall judge it necessary to stop at Madeira the Cape de Verd or Canary Islands to take in wine for the use of their companies in which case you are at liberty to do so taking care to remain there no longer than may be necessary for that purpose  On your arrival at the Cape of Good Hope you are to refresh the sloops companies and to cause the sloops to be supplied with as much provisions and water as they can conveniently stow  You are if possible to leave the Cape of Good Hope by the end of October or the beginning of November next and proceed to the southward in search of some islands said to have been lately seen by the French in the latitude of ° south and about the meridian of Mauritius In case you find those islands you are to examine them thoroughly for a good harbour and upon discovering one make the necessary observations to facilitate the finding it again as a good port in that situation may hereafter prove very useful although it should afford little or nothing more than shelter wood and water You are not however to spend too much time in looking out for those islands or in the examination of them if found but to proceed to Otaheite or the Society's Isles touching at New Zealand in your way thither if you should judge it necessary and convenient and taking care to arrive there time enough to admit of your giving the sloops companies the refreshment they may stand in need of before you prosecute the farther object of these instructions  Upon your arrival at Otaheite or the Society Isles you are to land Omiah at such of them as he may choose and to leave him there  You are to destribute among the Chiefs of those islands such parts of the presents with which you have been supplied as you shall judge proper reserving the remainder to distribute among the natives of the countries you may discover in the Northern Hemisphere and having refreshed the people belonging to the sloops under your command and taken on board such wood and water as they may respectively stand in need of you are to leave those islands in the beginning of February or sooner if you shall judge it necessary and then proceed in as direct a course as you can to the coast of New Albion endeavouring to fall in with it in the latitude of ° N and taking care in your way thither not to lose any time in search of new lands or to stop at any you may fall in with unless you may find it necessary to recruit your wood and water  You are also in your way thither strictly enjoined not to touch upon any part of the Spanish dominions on the western continent of America unless driven thither by some unavoidable accident in which case you are to stay no longer there than shall be absolutely necessary and to be very careful not to give any umbrage or offence to any of the inhabitants or subjects of his Catholic Majesty And if in your further progress to the northward as hereafter directed you find any subjects of any European prince or state upon any part of the coast you may think proper to visit you are not to disturb them or give them any just cause of offence but on the contrary to treat them with civility and friendship  Upon your arrival on the coast of New Albion you are to put into the first convenient port to recruit your wood and water and procure refreshments and then to proceed northward along the coast as far as the latitude of ° or farther if you are not obstructed by lands or ice taking care not to lose any time in exploring rivers or inlets or upon any other account until you get into the beforementioned latitude of ° where we could wish you to arrive in the month of June next When you get that length you are very carefully to search for and to explore such rivers or inlets as may appear to be of a considerable extent and pointing towards Hudson's or Baffin's Bay and if from you own observations or from any information you may receive from the natives who there is reason to believe are the same race of people and speak the same language of which you are furnished with a vocabulary as the Esquimaux there shall appear to be a certainty or even a probability of a water passage into the aforementioned bays or either of them you are in such case to use your utmost endeavours to pass through with one or both of the sloops unless you shall be of opinion that the passage may be effected with more certainty or with greater probability by smaller vessels in which case you are to set up the frames of one or both the small vessels with which you are provided and when they are put together and are properly fitted stored and victualled you are to dispatch one or both of them under the care of proper officers with a sufficient number of petty officers men and boats in order to attempt the said passage with such instructions for their rejoining you if they should fail or for their further proceedings if they should succeed in the attempt as you shall judge most proper  But nevertheless if you shall find it more eligible to pursue any other measures than those above pointed out in order to make a discovery of the beforementioned passage if any such there be you are at liberty and we leave it to your discretion to pursue such measures accordingly  In case you shall be satisfied that there is no passage through to the abovementioned bays sufficient for the purposes of navigation you are at the proper season of the year to repair to the port of St Peter and St Paul in Kamtschatka or wherever else you shall judge more proper in order to refresh your people and pass the winter and in the spring of the ensuing year to proceed from thence to the northward as far as in your prudence you may think proper in further search of a northeast or a northwest passage from the Pacific Ocean or the North Sea And if from your own obsevation or any information you may receive there shall appear to be a probability of such passage you are to proceed as above directed and having discovered such passage or failed in the attempt make the best of your way back to England by such route as you may think best for the improvement of geography and navigation repairing to Spithead with both ships where they are to remain till further order  At whatever places you may touch in the course of your voyage where accurate observations of the nature hereafter mentioned have not already been made you are as far as your time will allow very carefully to observe the true situation of such places both in latitude and longitude the variation of the needle bearings of headlands height direction and course of the tides and currents depths and soundings of the sea shoals rocks c and also to survey make charts and  take views of such bays harbours and different parts of the coast And to make such notations thereon as may be useful either to navigation or commerce You are also carefully to observe the nature of the soil and the produce thereof the animals and fowls that inhabit or frequent it the fishes that are to be found in the rivers or upon the coast and in what plenty and in case there are any peculiar to such places to describe them as minutely and to make as accurate drawings of them as you can and if you find any metals minerals or valuable stones or any extraneous fossils you are to bring home specimens of each as also of the seeds of such trees shrubs plants fruits and grains peculiar to those places as you may be able to collect and to transmit them to our Secretary that proper examination and experiments may be made of them You are likewise to observe the genius temper disposition and number of the natives and inhabitants where you find any and to endeavour by all proper means to cultivate a friendship with them making them presents of such trinkets as you may have on board and they may like best inviting them to traffic and shewing them every kind of civility and regard but taking care nevertheless not to suffer yourself to be surprized by them but to be always on your guard against any accidents  You are also with the consent of the natives to take possession in the name of the King of Great Britain of convenient situations in such countries as you may discover that have not already been discovered or visited by any other European power and to distribute among the inhabitants such things as will remain as traces and testimonies of your having been there but if you find the countries so discovered are uninhabited  you are to take possession of them for his Majesty by setting up proper marks and inscriptions as first discoverers and possessors  But forasmuch as in undertakings of this nature several emergencies may arise not to be soreseen and therefore not particularly to be provided for by instructions beforehand you are in all such cases to proceed as you shall judge most advantageous to the service on which you are employed You are by all opportunities to send to our Secretary for our information accounts of your proceedings and copies of the surveys and drawings you shall have made and upon your arrival in England you are immediately to repair to this office in order to lay before us a full account of your proceedings in the whole course of your voyage taking care before you leave the sloop to demand from the officers and petty officers the logbooks and journals they may have kept and to seal them up for our inspection and enjoining them and the whole crew not to divulge where they have been until they shall have permission so to do and you are to direct Capt Clerke to do the same with respect to the officers petty officers and crew of the Discovery  If any accident should happen to the Resolution in the course of the voyage so as to disable her from proceeding any farther you are in such case to remove yourself and her crew into the Discovery and to prosecute your voyage in her her Commander being hereby strictly required to receive you on board and to obey your orders the same in every respect as when you were actually on board the Resolution And in case of your inability by sickness or otherwise to carry these instructions into execution you are to be careful  to leave them with the next officer in command who is hereby required to execute them in the best manner he can  Given under our hands  the th day of July  By command of their Lordships  SANDWICH  C SPENCER  H PALLISER  P H STEPHENS  It remains now only briefly to enumerate the stores and provisions that were ordered by his Majesty under the direction of the Lords of the Admiralty to be prepared for the compleat equipment of the expedition Particular care was ordered to be taken that the rigging of both ships should be of the best quality and that the quantities required of each sort should be fully supplied that every thing that had been found by the experience of former voyagers to be of use in preserving the health of the seamen should be furnished in abundance that not only those things that were immediately conducive to the subsistence and accommodation of the respective crews on board but also what might be of permanent advantage to the inhabitants of those islands and countries where they might chance to be driven for relief or refreshment With this view a bull two cows with their calves and some sheep were put on board intending to add to these other useful animals when they arrived at the Cape From the same benevolent motive great quantities of European garden seeds and roots were put on board and both ships were provided with store of iron tools the most useful and those best calculated for traffic and to cultivate a friendly intercourse with the inhabitants of such new countries as they should be so fortunate as to discover Add  to these trinkets toys beads lookingglasses and nails without number  But this was not all the naval board had objects of a more extensive nature in view the improvement of astronomy and navigation the cultivation of science and the important acquisitions to natural history these were all provided for and proper instruments and proper masters were allotted for each And for the more striking delineation of those memorable scenes and rare productions in nature that might present themselves in the course of so ample a range as the circumnavigation of the globe painters and artists were engaged to supply the imperfections of written accounts and to illustrate what otherwise could not be fully described  Having now given a brief retrospective view of all the voyages that have been undertaken with a view to discovery in the great Pacific Ocean and having likewise recounted the many unsuccessful attempts that have been made by the most celebrated navigators of our own nation for the discovery of a passage between the two Great Seas in the Northern Hemisphere we shall conclude this long introduction with only observing that the journal of the voyage that follows is not in reality the voyage of the  Resolution  but of the  Discovery  that accompanied the  Resolution  without which the history of the voyage would be obviously

August till their leaving the Society Islands in the South Seas Dec th to begin their Discoveries to the North  HAVING taken in our guns at the Galleons and what stores were wanting  On the th of June both ships came to an anchor at the Nore but our fresh provisions being nearly exhausted we weighed next day and left the Resolution waiting for her Commander  On the th came too off Deal and received on board a great quantity of beef and mutton  for the ship's company and a boat for the Captain's use It blew hard in the night and all the next day  On the th we weighed anchor and sailed but we had no sooner entered the channel than a storm arose by which we were driven into Portland Roads where we received considerable damage We had blowing weather till  The th when we arrived at Plymouth There we found a large fleet of men of war and transports with troops on board for America and saluted the Admiral with guns They had been driven in there by stress of weather several of them much damaged About at noon we came to moorings in the Sound  On the th the Resolution arrived saluted the Admiral and came too and moored close by us  It was now found necessary before we proceeded to go into harbour to repair the damages our ship had received in the storm of the th and the Resolution proposed to wait till we were in readiness but it was with difficulty that an order was obtained for the carpenters to begin and when it was obtained it was some time before it could be carried into execution The repairs of the fleet for America being judged of greater consequence than the repairs of a ship commissioned for discovery  The Resolution tired with delay when the day came that she set sail on her former voyage which was  On the th of July the impatience of the ship's company and the notion they had entertained of its being a lucky day induced Capt Cook to comply with their importunities and he accordingly set sail leaving orders with Capt  Clerke to follow him to St Jago and if he should there miss of him to pursue his course directly for the Cape of Good Hope  This was unwelcome news to the ship's company of the Discovery who were equally impatient to set sail and equally possessed of notions of lucky days with those of their brethren in the Discovery  During this tedious interval of unavoidable delay a succinct account of Omai the native of Ulietea who embarked with Capt Cook on board the Resolution on his return home will give those who never had an opportunity of seeing him while in England some idea of his person his genius his character and acquirements  This the Editor thought it his province to supply and has taken no small pains to collect from the writings of the gentlemen who had the best opportunities of knowing and conversing with Omai while in England their sentiments respecting him which though not entirely corresponding with the ideas of the Journalist as will be seen in the sequel yet to do Omai ample justice the Editor thinks of it incumbent on him to conceal nothing that has appeared in his favour  This man it appears by the testimony of Capt Cook had once some property in his own country of which he was dispossessed by the people of Bolabola Capt Cook at first wondered that Capt Furneaux would encumber himself with so ordinary a person who was not in his opinion a proper representative of the inhabitants of those happy islands and Mr Forster says it is doing him no injustice to assert that among all the inhabitants of Otaheite and the Society Isles he had seen few individuals so illfavoured as Omai neither  did he seem of eminence in rank or parts more than in shape figure or complexion to attract the notice of an enlightened nation but seemed adds Mr Forster to be one of the common people and the rather as he did not aspire to the Captain's company but preferred that of the armourer and common seamen to those of superior rank yet notwithstanding the contemptible opinion which both these gentlemen seems to have entertained of him at first as soon as he reached the Cape of Good Hope and Capt Cook had dressed him in his own clothes and introduced him to the best company he then declared he was not a  towtow  or one of the common class but a  hoa  or attendant on the King and Capt Cook acknowledges that since he arrived in England he had his doubts whether any of the natives would have given more general satisfaction It will not we presume be thought tedious if we add his character as drawn by Capt Cook and Mr Forster in their respective histories of the Voyage undertaken to determine the existence or nonexistence of a Southern Continent in  "Omai" says Capt Cook "has most certainly a good understanding quick parts and honest principles he has a natural good behaviour which rendered him acceptable to the best company and a proper degree of pride which taught him to avoid the society of persons of inferior rank He has passions of the same kind as other young men but has judgment enough not to indulge them in any improper excess I do not imagine adds the Captain that he has any dislike to liquor and if he had fallen into company where the person who drank the most met with the most approbation I have no doubt but that he would have endeavoured to gain the applause  of those with whom he associated but fortunately for him he perceived that drinking was very little in use but among inferior people and as he was very watchful into the manners and conduct of the persons of rank who honoured him with their protection he was sober and modest and I never heard that during the whole time of his staying in England which was two years he ever once was disguised with wine or ever shewed an inclination to go beyond the strictest rules of moderation  "Soon after his arrival in London the Earl of Sandwich introduced him to his Majesty at Kew where he met with a most gracious reception and imbibed the strongest impressions of duty and gratitude to that great and amiable Prince which I am persuaded he will preserve to the latest moment of his life During his stay he was caressed by many of the chief Nobility but his principal patrons were the Earl of Sandwich Mr Banks and Dr Solander"  Capt Cook adds  "that though Omai lived in the midst of amusements during his residence in England his return to his own country was always in his thoughts and though he was not impatient to go he expressed a satisfaction as the time of his return approached"  Thus far Capt Cook in his own account of his Voyage for the Discovery of a Southern Continent and though there are some traits of this character to be discerned in that drawn by Mr Forster yet his good qualities are there so blended with childishness and folly that one can hardly think it applicable to the same identical person  "Omai" says Mr Forster "has been considered either as remarkably stupid or very intelligent according to the different allowances which  were made by those who judged of his abilities His language which is destitute of every harsh consonant and where every word ends with a vowel had so little exercised his organs of speech that they were wholly unfit to pronounce the more complicated English sounds and this physical or rather habitual defect has too often been misconstrued Upon his arrival in England he was immediately introduced into general company led to the most splendid entertainments and presented at court amidst a brilliant circle of the first nobility He naturally imitated that easy and elegant politeness which is so prevalent in all those places he adopted the manners the occupations and amusements of his companions and gave many proofs of a quick perception and lively fancy Among the instances of his intelligence I need only mention his knowledge of the game of Chess in which he had made an amazing proficiency The multiplicity of objects which crowded upon him prevented his paying due attention to those particulars which would have been beneficial to himself and his countrymen at his return He was not able to form a general comprehensive view of our whole civilized system and to abstract from thence what appeared most strikingly useful and applicable to the improvement of his country His senses were charmed by beauty symmetry harmony and magnificence they called aloud for gratification and he was accustomed to obey their voice The continued round of enjoyments left him no time to think of his future life and being destitute of the genius of a Tupaïa whose superior abilities would have enabled him to form a plan for his own conduct his understanding remained unimproved After having spent near two years  in England Mr Forster adds that his judgment was in its infant state and therefore when he was preparing to return he coveted almost every thing he saw and particularly that which amused him by some unexpected effect to gratify his childish inclinations as it should seem rather than from any other motives he was indulged with a portable organ an electrical machine a coat of mail and a suit of armour"  Such is the account and such the character of this child of curiosity who left his country and his connections to roam he did not know where nor for what having no idea of improving the arts manufactures or commerce of his country or introducing one useful art or science among them He carried with him besides the articles above enumerated a profusion of almost every thing that can be named axes saws chissels and carpenters tools of every kind all sorts of Birmingham and Sheffield wares guns pistols cutlasses powder and ammunition needles pins fishhooks and various implements for sport nets of all sorts with hand engines and a lathe for turning He had likewise clothes of different colours and different fabrics laced and plain some made in the style of his country and several after our manner some of these last he bartered with the petty officers after he had passed the Friendly Islands for red feathers He was likewise plentifully supplied with glass and china wares with beads and baubles some of great value medals of various metals a watch was presented to him by a person of distinction in short nothing was with held from him that he required either for trade in his own country or to gratify his humour  When he came on board the Resolution he discovered uncommon ecstasy but when he parted with the gentlemen who accompanied him the tears as Mr Forster observes flowed plentifully but they were childish tears and the moment his old friends had left the ship he was as lively and brisk as ever He shewed no concern about leaving this country but rather rejoiced at his going  "Omai" Capt Cook says "left London with a mixture of regret and satisfaction When he talked about England and about those who during his stay had honoured him with their protection or friendship I could observe that his spirits were sensibly affected and that it was with difficulty he could refrain from tears but the instant the conversation turned to his own island his eyes began to sparkle with joy"  We shall see in the sequel how he behaved on board and in what manner he was received on his return to his own island Come we now to the departure of the ship  On the st of August we weighed and proceeded with all sails set to join the Resolution While our ship was repairing it was observable that those who had never been employed on discovery before were more impatient to depart than those who had already experienced the severities of a Southern Navigation near and within the polar circle and it was diverting enough to listen to the ludicrous remarks of these last on their freshwater brethren as they called them whom they ventured to foretel would like the Jews in the wilderness be the first to murmur and cry out for  the leeks and the onions of Egypt  intimating that when these raw sailors came among the islands of ice in the frozen regions to  feel  the  effects of scanty fare and hard duty they would then be the first to repent their impetuosity and to sigh for the roast beef and porter of the land they were now so desirous to leave  We proceeded with a brisk gale till the th when in sight of Cape Finisterre the clouds began to darken and the waves to swell and to threaten by every appearance an approaching tempest Several ships were then in fight and we could clearly discern that they were preparing as well as ourselves to meet the storm For twentyfour hours it blowed and rained incessantly but on the th a calm succeeded which however was not of long continuance for in the evening of the same day it thundered lightned and the rain poured down in torrents The drops were such as no man on board had seen the like To prevent the effects of the lightning it was thought necessary to let fall the chain from the masthead a precaution which Capt Clerke never omitted when there was danger from lightning to be apprehended  On the th seeing a ship to windward bearing down very fast and suspecting her to be an American privateer all hands were ordered to quarters to be in readiness to engage She proved to be a Lisbon trader who by the violence of the gale the day before had been driven many leagues to the Eastward of her course and was in some distress We spared her those things of which she stood most in need and pursued our voyage  Nothing remarkable till the th when the ship's company were put to short allowance of water and the machine adjusted to distil seawater This was occasionally made use of during the Voyage and answered very well for particular purposes but was seldom or ever used for  boiling of meat These precautions were taken lest the Resolution should have left St Jago and the Discovery been obliged to proceed to the Cape without being able to procure a fresh supply  On the th we crossed the Tropic of Cancer for the first time and  On the th came in fight of St Jago bearing N W distant about six or seven leagues We bore away instantly for the Bay and at eight in the morning made land An officer was then sent ashore to make enquiry who brought word that the Resolution had not touched at that port probably because the rainy season was approaching when it is unsafe to remain there during its continuance The same reasons that had induced the Resolution to proceed were doubly pressing upon us It was now about the time when the rainy season begins though as yet we had observed none of its approaches It is generally preceded by a strong southerly wind and a great swell The sea comes rolling on and dashing furiously against the rocky shore causes a frightful surf Sometimes tornadoes or violent whirlwinds arise near the coast and greatly increase the danger For this reason from the middle of August till the month of November Port Praya the principal harbour in the island is but little frequented  The officer was no sooner returned and the boat hoisted on board than we made sail with a gentle breeze which continued till  Sept st when a dreadful tempest arose in which we every moment expected to perish The thunder and lightning were not more alarming than the sheets of rain which fell so heavy as to endanger the sinking of the ship and at the same time though in the open day involved us in a  cloud of darkness than which nothing could be more horrible providentially the continuance of this tempest was but short it began about nine in the morning and before noon the whole atmosphere was perfectly serene and not a spot nor a shade to be seen to mark the place of this elemental conflict However in this short period our sufferings nearly kept pace with our apprehensions having our maintopgallant yard carried away in the slings and the fail frittered to a thousand pieces the jib and middle staysails torn clear off and the ship so strained as to make all hands to the pump necessary The afternoon was employed in repairing the damages and discharging the water which had been shipped as well from the heavens as from the sea  Sept the weather continued squally with rain but as we approached the line a calm succeeded and the sky became serene but with a haziness and languor as if the current of the air like water upon an equipoise moved only by its own impulse Nothing could be more tedious and disagreeable than this calm but fortunately its duration was but short  Sept th at eight in the morning saw a sail the second we had seen since we passed Cape Finisterre on the coast of Spain We were at this time intent on fishing and having hooked a shark of an enormous size both officers and men were engaged in getting him on board When he was cut up there were six young ones found in his belly about two feet long each These were divided among the officers and one was dressed for the great cabin The old shark was eaten by the ship's crew to whom fresh food of any kind was now become a dainty  The weather continuing fine the Captain ordered the great guns and small arms to be exercised the ship to be smoaked and the bedding to be aired These last articles it may be once for all necessary to observe were never omitted during the Voyage when the weather would permit but were more particularly necessary in crossing the Line as it has been observed that the woodwork between decks in this low latitude is more apt to become mouldy and the iron to rust than in higher latitudes probably owing to that sluggishness in the air that has been already noticed and for which Nature seems to have provided a remedy by the frequent tempests and tornadoes to which this part of the ocean is remarkably subject  Nothing worthy notice till the th when we crossed the Line The weather being squally the usual ceremony of keelhawling the sailors who had never crossed it before was omitted This ceremony is so well known that it were needless to describe it  On the th the weather became moderate when upon examination the starboard main trusseltree was found to be sprung  On the th George Harrison Corporal of Marines sitting carelesly on the bowsprit diverting himself with the sporting of the dolphins fell overboard He was seen to fall and the ship was instantly hove to and the boats got out with all possible expedition but he was never again seen to rise His Dutch cap was taken up at the ship's stern and as it was known that he was an excellent swimmer the boats made a large circuit round the ship in hopes to recover him but in vain It is remarkable that in Capt Cook's former Voyage one Henry Smock one of the  map of Captain Cook's voyages in the Pacific  A CHART Shewing the Tracks and Discoveries in the PACIFIC OCEAN MADE BY Cap  t  Cook and Cap  t  Clerke in His Majesty's Ships RESOLUTION and DISCOVERY in the Years  Carpenter's mates siting on the skuttle fell overboard much in the same manner and shared the same fate Both these were young men sober and of good characters Their loss was regretted by the officers but more particularly so by their comrades among the crew It is more than probable that both were instantly swallowed up by sharks that constantly attend the ships Nothing remarkable till  Oct when we caught a large shark feet long with several young dolphins in her belly part of the entrails when cleansed and dressed were eaten in the great cabin and the body given to those by whom it was caught When fried it is tolerable meat but the fat is very loathsome  On the d a storm arose accompanied with thunder lightning and rain As it was not so violent as those we had before experienced it proved more acceptable than alarming as it supplied the ship's company with a good quantity of fresh water which they caught in blankets or by other contrivances every one as he could What was caught in the awnings was saved for the officers use  On the th it blew a hurricanebanded the sails and lay to all night under bare poles  On the th the storm abated and the sky became clear we observed a ship to the Southward which by her course we took for the Resolution We crouded sail stood after her and soon came up with her She proved to be a Dutch adviceboat bound to the Cape  On the th our people began to look for land and the appearance of some birds which are know never to go far from shore confirmed them that the extremity of the African coast was at no great distance Our Astronomer however was  of a different opinion and the event proved that he was right  Nov having now been at sea just three months without once setting foot on land those who were unaccustomed to such long voyages began to put on a very different aspect to that they were at first setting out They were indeed somewhat comforted by the chearfulness and vivacity which they observed to prevail in almost every countenance except their own from whence they concluded that many days could not elapse before the painful sensations of a solitary sea life would be recompensed by the pleasurable enjoyments they would find when they came on shore Such perhaps were the feelings at that time of the writer of this Journal  On the d we still observed a great variety of fish and fowl to accompany the ship some of which we had never noticed before and we could not but remark the difference in this respect between the Western coasts of the Old Continent and the Western coasts of the New in the same latitudes No sooner had we crossed the Tropic of Cancer than we were amused by the sporting of the joyous inhabitants of the deep or more properly perhaps by their unremitting labour in pursuit of their daily food Flying fish are generally the first to attract the notice of those who never have been in these seas before and it is curious to attend to their numberless windings and shiftings to elude the attacks of the Dolphins and Bonitos their declared enemies Whatever may be the design of Providence in the formation of these unhappy beings one cannot help considering their existence as a state of perpetual punishment While they remain in the water their enemies are there and though Nature has given  them the power to quit that element and to fly for refuge to the open air yet other persecutors are there also no less cruel than those they have escaped Boobies Man of War birds and other sea fowls are continually watching to make the Flyingfish their prey while the ravenous Sharks are no less vigilant in making reprisals on the Dolphins and Bonitos Thus a passage through the tropical latitudes in this sea exhibits one continued scene of warfare while in the Southern Ocean in the same latitudes all is peace and uniform tranquillity These reflections naturally occur when the mind unoccupied by variety is disposed for contemplation  We too who had contributed to play a part in this tragic scene by catching several enormous Sharks left some few tyrants the less to vex the ocean  On the th at six in the morning a man at the masthead called out land and at eight we could all see it involved in a misty cloud It proved to be Table Land bearing S W at the distance of about ten leagues which induced us to change our course from E S E to S S W  On the th we entered Table Bay and  On the th came to and anchored in six sathom water where to our great joy we found the Resolution  We saluted the garrison with guns and were answered by the same number Capt Cook with the principal officers and gentlemen belonging to that ship came on board to bid us welcome By them we learnt that they had been at the Cape near three weeks that in their course they had touched at Tenerisse for hay and corn for their live stock that they were there hospitably received that the water was good but at that  time scarce that they found Teneriffe a much more eligible place than Madeira to recruit their stores and that though the wine of the latter is most certainly preferable to that of the former it is sold in proportion that of Madeira not being to be purchased for less than l a pipe while that of Teneriffe cost only l They found the people in general civil and obliging the air healthy but the soil barren Santa Cruz where they anchored is well built the churches decent but not magnificent They stayed there only three days and then continued their voyage to the Cape without meeting with any thing worth remarking except that in passing Bonavista they had but just time to weather the breakers consequently their situation for a few minutes was critical and alarming They just looked into Port Praya in the island of St Jago and not seeing us they pursued their course and on the th of October anchored in Table Bay where they found two French EastIndia ships and one just wrecked and the cargo plundered by the inhabitants  Before our arrival a storm had arisen at the Cape which lasted three days during which there was no communication between the ships and the shore and the Resolution was the only ship in the bay that rode out the gale without dragging her anchors On the d of November the storm ceased and Capt Cook having landed his cattle a bull and two cows and sheep the dogs in the night got among the sheep killed four and dispersed the rest Six of them however were recovered the next day but the two rams and two of the finest ewes were among the missing the two last were never recovered  On our landing our Captain was met by the officers of the garrison and the gentlemen belonging to the Dutch EastIndia Company who  received him very politely and gave him a general invitation to share with them the entertainments of the place  The subordinate officers on board were met by another class of inferior gentry belonging to the same Company with a like invitation but on different terms Almost every officer in the pay of the Dutch EastIndia Company furnish strangers with lodging and board on moderate terms from two shillings a day to five  Nothing in nature can make a more horrid appearance than the rugged mountains that form the Bay One would be tempted almost to think that the Dutch had made choice of the barrenest spot upon earth to shew what may be effected by slow industry and continued perseverance for besides the craggy cliffs that render the open country almost inaccessible the soil is so sandy and poor that except some vineyards there is scarce a shrub or a tree to be seen within any walking distance from the place  In an excursion that Mr Anderson Surgeon of the Resolution made in search of plants he was shewn a solid stone half a mile in circumference at the bottom and rounding to a point like the dome of St Paul's Other writers say this stone is above a mile in circumference at the base  The town is situated below the mountains and when seen from their summits appears with the gardens and plantations that run along the shore exceedingly picturesque in short nothing can be more romantic nor any prospect more pleasing to the eye  Our ship was no sooner moored than all hands were employed to strip off the rigging and to unload the stores places proper for repairing the one and for airing and examining the other being  prepared beforehand by Capt Cook and the utmost dispatch was made to shorten our stay as the time for navigating the high latitudes through which we were to pass was advancing apace and the Resolution was already in a state fit to undertake the voyage  What remained for Capt Cook to do when we arrived was chiefly to purchase live cattle for presents to Erees in the South Sea likewise live stock for the ship's use these are always the last things provided because it is found necessary to shorten as much as possible their continuance on board He had already laid in sufficient store of beef mutton poultry and greens for present use and had contracted for a good quantity of salted beef and bread to save what we had brought from England as those articles are found to keep better than the beef and bread prepared at the Cape  Among the cattle purchased were young bulls heifers young stonehorses mares rams several ewes and goats and some rabbits and poultry all of them intended for New Zealand Otaheite and the neighbouring islands or other places where there was a prospect of their being suffered to breed Some dogs too were purchased cats we had in plenty  Stored with these the Resolution resembled the Ark in which all the animals that were to stock the little world to which he was bound were collected and with their provender they occupied no small part of the ship's stowage  While we remained at the Cape two Dutch ships arrived full of sick soldiers who had been enlisted in Holland and who were in a miserable condition both as to health and want of common necessaries They had been near five months on  their voyage from Amsterdam and had lost on the passage more men than the complements of both our ships amounted to owing to nastiness and close confinement It is remarkable that no ships have the appearance of being neater kept than those of the Dutch nor any more slovenly where they are not exposed to open view  A very uncommon incident happened while we were at the Cape which might have embroiled us with the government there had not the delinquent been discovered and punished It was observed that a number of counterfeit schellings and double keys had been circulated and several of our people had taken them in exchange for gold Complaint was made by us against the inhabitants for taking the advantage of the ignorance of strangers to impose counterfeit money upon them as it was not to be supposed that they could be judges of the goodness of their country coin On the other hand the inhabitants charged the bad money as proceeding from us Each were warm in their representations and each were positive in their opinions It was not thought possible that any of our people could be prepared to counterfeit Dutch money and yet there had been no instance of counterfeit money having ever been seen at the Cape before the arrival of our ships at that port Thus the matter rested for awhile till one of the ship's armourers having obtained leave to go ashore made himself drunk and offered base money in payment for his liquor Being detained and notice given his officer he caused him to be searched when several other pieces of a base coin were found upon him But it does not appear that this was so serious a business as our Journalist has represented it who says that to accommodate the matter with the Dutch the delinquent was  sent home in the Hampshire Indiamen It was the Cook that was sent home in the Hampshire because he was a troublesome fellow  Capt Cook says only that he sent home in the Hampshire an invalid and was sorry he had not sent two or three more  On the th of November orders were given to prepare for sailing And  On the th of the same month the Governor and principal Officers belonging to the Company were entertained on board the Resolution where they came to take leave of our Captains before their departure as we were expected to sail in a few days the repairs of the ships being fully compleated The stores had all been ordered on board some days before and a large quantity of beer purchased for the ship's company at the only brewery that is publicly tolerated within the jurisdiction of the town In short there is not one necessary article relating to the repairing providing and victualling of shipping that is not to be purchased at the Cape of Good Hope and that too at very reasonable prices The wine at the Cape has been thought dear because that of the choicest vintage is scarce and like the styre in England confined to a very small spot Or the real Constantia which is the wine so much prized in Europe the whole plantation does not perhaps produce more than forty pipes annually though there may be two or three hundred disposed of under that name The wine commonly taken on board the shipping for the officers use is of a kind not unlike Madeira but of an inferior sort the vines here being rather impoverished by reason of the dryness of the soil  On the th our live stock were all got on board and properly provided for and secured  and having dispatched our letters to our friends and left nothing to do but to weigh and sail  On the th having quitted our moorings we next day came to an anchor in fathom water Penguin island bearing N by W five or six miles  On the st of December at three in the morning we took our departure after saluting the Fort with guns which they returned with the same number At this time we observed that luminous appearance about our ships which different Voyagers have attributed to different causes Dr Franklin has endeavoured to account for it on the principles of electricity but late voyagers have exploded that conceit On some of the water being taken up it was found to abound with innumerable swarms of a luminous animal which the microscope discovered to be like crayfish  About five in the afternoon we met with one of those terrible gusts so frequently experienced by Voyagers in doubling the Cape of Good Hope in which our mainsail was split but fortunately we received no other damage  On the th in the morning it blew a hurricane and split the jib About two in the afternoon unbent and bent another  On the th the weather that had been cloudy and boisterous ever since leaving the Cape became clear and moderate In latitude ° ′ S the Resolution's boat with Mr King the second Mate and Omai on board came to compare the timepieces and found no material variation  On the th in lat ° ′ a dreadful storm came on which obliged both ships to lay to that and the following night under bare poles  On the th in lat ° ′ it began to show and hail and the weather became intolerably  cold insomuch that from a scorching heat which we felt at the Cape the change was so great in the space of thirteen days that we were obliged to line the hatchways with canvas to defend the men below as much as possible from the effects of the frost Here the Albatrosses and other sea fowl began to make their appearance and here seals and porpoises were seen to sport about the ship certain indications of approaching land  On the th at six in the morning in lat ° ′ and long ° ′ E we came in sight of land having the appearance of two islands the Easternmost bearing S S E ½ E the Westernmost S by W ½ W To these Capt Cook gave the name of Prince Edward's Isles At ten in the forenoon passed between the islands through a very narrow channel Piercing cold with sleet and snow with which the islands were lightly covered but neither tree nor shrub was to be seen nor any living thing except penguins and shags the former so numerous that the rocks seemed covered with them as with a crust These were the Marion Isles already discovered  M de Marion when he discovered these islands had two ships under his command one the Mascarin Capt Crozet the other the Castrie Capt du Clesmure They proceeded to the Southern extremity of New Holland and from thence to the Bay of Islands in New Zealand where M de Marion was killed with twentyeight of his men by the natives He was obliged having lost his masts to search for new ones in the woods of that country but when he found trees fit for his purpose he found himself under the necessity of cutting a road three miles in length through the thickets to bring them to the waterside While  one party of his people were employed in this service another party was placed on an island in the bay to clean the casks and fill them with water and a third was occasionally sent on shore to cut wood for the ship's use Thus employed they had been there thirtythree days upon the best terms with the natives who freely offered their women to the sailors when M de Marion not suspecting any treachery went one morning as his custom was to visit the different parties that were at work Having called to see the waterers he went next to the Hippah a fortification of the natives where he commonly used to stop in his way to the carpenters Here he was suddenly set upon and with his few attendants barbarously butchered as were the boats crew that carried him on shore Next morning the Lieutenant who commanded on board not knowing what had happened sent a party to cut grass and when every one was at work the natives watched the opportunity to fall upon them likewise and murdered the whole party except a single sailor who ran for his life and threw himself wounded into the sea Being seen from the ships he was speedily taken on board and gave the general alarm M Crozet's situation who commanded the Carpenters in the woods was now become most critical A corporal and four marines were immediately dispatched to acquaint him of his danger while several boats attended to receive his people He disposed every thing as well as the time would admit and effected his retreat to the seaside Here he found multitudes of the natives assembled with a daring Chief at their head M Crozet ordered the marines who attended him to direct their fire if he gave the word against such persons as he should point out  He then ordered the carpenters and convalescents to strike the tents and the sick to be embarked while he with the soldiers should talk with the leader This man told them that M Marion was killed by a warrior upon which M Crozet seized a stake and forcing it into the ground made signs that he should advance no farther The countenance with which this action was attended startled the savage whose courage failing him M Crozet insisted on his ordering the crowd to sit down which was accordingly complied with He now paraded in front of the enemy till all his people were embarked his soldiers were then ordered to follow and himself was the last who entered the boat He had scarce put off when the whole body of the natives began their song of defiance and discharged their vollies of stones however a shot from the ship soon dispersed them and the company got all safe on board From this time the natives became troublesome and made several attempts to attack his people by surprize They formed an attack against the watering party in the night which but for the vigilance of the guard would have been fatal to them they afterwards openly attacked the ships in more than a hundred large canoes full of men who had cause sorely to repent their audacity and severely felt the effect of European arms At length M Crozet finding it impossible to supply the ships with masts unless he could drive the natives from his neighbourhood made an attack upon their Hippah which they vainly boasted was beyond his power to approach He placed the carpenters in the front who in an instant levelled their palisadoes then cut a breach through the mound and levelled the ditch behind which  their warriors stood in great numbers on their fighting stages  Into his breach a Chief instantly threw himself with his spear in his hand He was shot dead by M Crozet's marksmen and presently another occupied his place stepping on the dead body He likewise fell a victim to his intrepid courage and in the same manner eight Chiefs successively defended it and bravely fell in this post of honour The rest seeing their leaders dead took flight and the French pursued and killed them with a heavy slaughter M Crozet offered fifty dollars to any person who should take a New Zealander alive but this was found impracticable A soldier seized an old man and began to drag him towards his Captain but the savage being disarmed bit into the fleshy part of his enemy's hand the exquisite pain of which so enraged the soldier that he ran the fellow through the body with his bayonet M Crozet found great quantities of arms tools and clothing in this Hippah together with store of dried fish and roots which seemed to be intended for winter provision He now compleated the repairs of his ships without interruption and prosecuted his voyage after a stay of sixtyfour days in this Bay of Islands From whence after passing through the Western part of the South Sea he returned by the Philippines to the Isle of France But to proceed  On the th the weather began to clear up and these islands six in number promising no refreshment both ships pursued their course to the S E wind W S W a brisk gale but piercing cold The other four islands retain their former name Our Captain ordered the jackets and trowsers to be delivered out which with the blankets and other warm clothing provided by  the Lords of the Admiralty against the severity of the frozen climates were found of infinite use  On the th in lat ° ′ the fogs came on so thick that we could but just discern the largest objects at the distance of the ship's length This being foreseen fogsignals were appointed and repeated every half hour  Nothing remarkable till  The th when we lost sight of the Resolution Signal guns were fired false fires lighted and lights hung at the masthead but no answer received  On the st in the morning the fog still continuing a very heavy storm came on attended with sleet and frequent gusts with hail All this day we continued firing signal guns and at night burning false fires and carrying lights at the masthead but all to no purpose  On the d the gale still increasing we carried away our jib sheer and split the jib but in the evening it cleared up and fortunately for both ships the Resolution came in sight which revived the drooping spirits of the crews  We were now accompanied with a great variety of sea fowl among which were pintadoes sheerwerers fulmers and grey peterels which last seldom appear at any considerable distance from land  On the d answering to the middle of June in the Northern Hemisphere the weather cleared up and we were proceeding at a great rate all reefs out when on a sudden the weather coming on hazy increased to a fog and we again lost sight of the Resolution but on ringing the fog bell and firing a gun we were answered by our consort to our inexpressible joy  About twelve at noon the fog began to disperse a clear sunshine brightened the horizon and shewed that we were at no great distance from land This indeed was not unexpected by our Commander The man at the masthead announced it but as it seemed at a great distance very lofty with the summits of its hills involved in mist some of our officers who had accompanied Capt Cook in his former voyages and had experienced many disappointments from the fallacious resemblance of ice islands to those of land expressed their doubts However the nearer we approached it the more convinced we were of its reality But what seemed to us very singular the sea began to change its complexion and from a dark green colour to look white like milk we had indeed observed the like phaenomenon before on crossing the Tropic in the Northern Hemisphere but do not recollect any such appearance noticed by former Voyagers in these high Southern latitudes  On the th we observed great quantities of seaweed floating on the surface and the seabirds to increase and before noon were so near the land as to discover rocks towering one upon another as we imagined to an immense height but could discern no plantations or other indications of its being inhabited As the coast appeared bold and rocky it was judged proper to proceed with caution When we first discovered land it bore South but on advancing slowly we came in sight of a separate island bearing S E by S which in the direction we first beheld it seemed to be part of one and the same island  On the th at six in the morning wore ship and stood in for the land we passed the tremendous rock which first came in view and which  rose to an astonishing height in form of a sugarloaf and bore away to the Lee Island where we found a bay with good anchorage in fathom water cozy bottom but the surf rather rough and inconvenient for landing and watering  On the th at four in the morning the boats were sent out to reconnoitre the coast and if possible to discover a more convenient harbour for taking in water About seven they returned having found a bottle with a letter inclosed importing that in January this island was discovered by M de Kerguelen that it contained plenty of water but no wood that it was barren and without inhabitants but that the shores abounded with fish and the land with seals sea lions and penguins The harbour where this bottle was deposited being more commodious than that in which the ships were anchor'd and Capt Cook intending to keep Christmas here and refresh his men gave orders to weigh and the ships to change their station which orders were instantly obeyed  The contents of the letter inclosed in the bottle were these  "Ludovico XV Galliorum Rege de Boynes Rege à Secretis ad res Maritimas annis "  But though the above inscription was all that the bottle contained the history of M De Kerguelen's voyage was well known and is therefore necessary to render our account of the discoveries in the South Seas compleat  This Navigator was only a Lieutenant in the French service but had the command of two ships given him the La Fortune and Le Gros Ventre or the purpose of Discovery He sailed from the Mauritius about the latter end of and on the th of January following discovered  the isles of which we are now speaking and to which he gave the names of the Isles of Fortune Soon after he had made land other land of a considerable extent and height came in sight which he supposed to be Continent upon which he sent one of the officers of his own ship ahead in the cutter to sound But the wind blowing fresh the Captain of the other ship M de St Allouarn in the Gros Ventre shot ahead and finding a bay to which he gave his ship's name ordered HIS yawl to take possession In the mean time M de Kerguelen being driven to leeward and unable again to recover his station both boats returned on board the Gros Ventre and the cutter was cut adrift on account of the bad weather M Kerguelen returned to the Mauritius and M de St Allouarn continued for three days to take the bearings of this land and doubled its Northern extremity beyond which it trended to the Southeastward He coasted it for the space of twenty leagues but finding it high and inaccessible and destitute of trees he shaped his course to New Holland and from thence returned by way of Timor and Batavia to the Isle of France where he died but previous to that event he was promoted to the command of a sixtyfour gun ship called the Rolland with the frigate l'Oiseau in order to perfect the discovery of this pretended Continent but returned with disgrace pretending again to have made the discovery  That the islands we now fell in with are the same discovered by Kerguelen there cannot remain a doubt but that M de Kerguelen ever saw a great country such as he pretends in or near those islands is very problematical There are indeed numberless islands thinly scattered in this almost boundless ocean as every day's experience  demonstrates but that there is not one so superior to those already discovered in riches and cultivation as to be worth the search will scarcely admit of a question  We now moored in a safe harbour were busied on board in repairing our rigging which had suffered much in the frequent squalls to which we had been subject ever since our departure from the Cape at the same time those who were on shore were no less usefully employed in supplying the ships with water and the crews with fresh provisions which last though not of the most delicate kind yet to stomachs cloyed almost to loathing with salt provisions even seals penguins and seafowl were not unsavoury meat  On the th our repairs being nearly compleated and a great part of our water shipped on board Christmas was proclaimed and the harbour where the ships lay named Christmas Harbour On this occasion a double quantity of grog was served out to each common man and a certain proportion of wine and spirits to every petty officer Leave was likewise given to such as were ailing to go ashore for the benefit of the land air and the officers of both ships reciprocally met in compliment to each other past dangers were forgotten and the day was spent by the common sailors with as much mirth and unconcern as if safely moored in Portsmouth harbour  On the th parties were sent out to procure what vegetables the island produced by way of refreshment but none were found for culinary purposes except a kind of wild cabbage and that in small quantities and gathered with much labour among the cliffs of the rocks Mr Nelson a gentleman whom Mr Banks sent out to collect  such varieties as he should find indigenous to the islands and climates through which he should pass found growing among those cliffs a kind of yellow moss of a silky softness which he had not yet discovered in any of his former researches  On the th the Resolution weighed having first left a memorial written on the other side of the parchment found in the bottle in the following words  "Naves Resolution Discovery de Rege Magnae Britanniae Decembris "  with a view to surround the island and to explore the opposite side which however upon examination was found equally barren craggy steep and desolate with that we had just left Penguins and sealions were its chief inhabitants among which our people made great havock of the former for the sake of provisions penguins having been found tolerable eating when fresh or just salted and of the latter for blubber which was afterwards boiled and converted into oil on our arrival at New Zealand  On the same day at nine in the morning we weighed and took leave of Christmas Harbour which we found by observation to lie in lat ° ′ S and in long ° ′ E and Capt Cook in obedience to his instructions proceeded to compleat the Discovery which had been left imperfect by French Voyagers During this and the following day we endeavoured to circumnavigate the whole cluster of islands and anchored in a harbour to which Capt Cook gave the name of Port Palliser in honour of the Admiral of that name situated in lat ° ′ S and long ° ′ E Here we compleated our water and reconnoitered the coast which we found barren beyond description No quadrupeds but seals were seen on these islands  On the st of January we observed great quantities of seaweed passing to leeward in a direction contrary to that we had seen in approaching the island which gave reason to suppose there were other lands at no great distance and in fact other lands presented but not more fertile than those we had passed The navigation here we found most dangerous The seaweed which grows to an astonishing length not less than fathom covers sunken rocks which we might be said miraculously to have escaped But having escaped we now pursued our course for Van Dieman's Land and having no discoveries in view took every advantage of the weather to carry sail While we were exploring this desolate coast two young bulls one heifer two rams and several of the goats died Nothing more remarkable presented till  The th when a hurricane arose accompanied with so thick a fog that our ships were every moment in danger of falling foul one of the other We kept the fog bell constantly ringing and guns firing which were answered by the Resolution The wind blew with such violence that we were obliged to take in all our sails to strike our topgallantmasts and to scud under our bare poles This storm continued with more or less violence till the th during which time the Resolution had carried away her foretopmast and foretopgallant mast and yard and the Discovery had lost her topgallantsails split her middle staysails and had scarce half a yard remaining of her jib  On the th in the morning we lay by to repair our rigging and the weather brightening up with a brisk but moderate gale in the afternoon we set all the sails we could unreefed our topsails  and run at the rate of seven and eight miles an hour by the log both ships in company  On the d the weather continuing clear and moderate Mr King the second Mate of the Resolution come on board to compare the timepieces He brought word that the ship's crew were in perfect health those only excepted who had been hurt by their misses at the Cape and even those were fit to do duty and that the damage the Resolution had received during the blowing weather was not so considerable as might have been expected  On the th in the morning the man at the masthead called out Land distant about five leagues the Mewstone so called by Capt Furneaux in bearing N E ½ E Made the signal for seeing it which was answered by the Resolution  On the th sounded and found ground at fathom sandy and shelly bottom  On the th stood off and on to find the bay called by Tasman Frederic Henry's Bay  On the th came to and moored in fathom water in Adventure Bay of which Cape Frederic Henry forms the North Point and was presently joined by the Resolution No sooner were the ships properly secured than the pinnace was ordered to be launched the boats to be manned and all hands set to work in wooding watering cutting grass for the cattle overhauling the rigging and getting every thing in readiness to continue our voyage  The officers astronomers and gentlemen on board both ships eagerly embraced the opportunity of going ashore to take a view of this delightful country with the appearance of which all on board were charmed The first thing that attracted  our notice were the trees that by their magnitude and loftiness exceeded every thing we had ever seen of the kind but what was remarkable we found many of them burnt near the ground and not a few lying in a horizontal position which being much scorched had been thrown down by the violence of the wind  On the th Capt Cook accompanied by officers and gentlemen from both ships and guarded by a party of marines made a second excursion into the country in order to make discoveries and to procure if possible an interview with some of the inhabitants they penetrated several miles through paths that seemed to have been frequented before they could get sight of any human being  On our part meaning the Journalist and his party we happened to be more successful for by passing by the edge of an almost impenetrable thicket we heard a rustling which at first we mistook for the rouzing of some wild beast but searching closely we found it to be a girl quite naked and alone At first she seemed much frightened but being kindly treated and her apprehensions of death removed she became docile and ready to answer every thing we could render intelligible to her understanding We questioned her concerning her residence which we did by pointing to every beaten path walking a little way in it and then returning and taking another making motions to her at the same time to lead us along and we would follow her To make her quite easy one of our company pulled off his handkerchief and put it about her neck by way of ornament and another covered her head with his cap and then dismissed her She ran among the bushes and in less than  an hour nine men of the middle stature made their appearance naked but armed according to the fashion of their country these were introduced to the officers and kindly treated one gentleman giving to one a part of his clothing another putting something upon a second and so on till each had received some trifling ornament for his person and all took their flight at once and vanished in an instant  These they received with stoical indifference and Capt Cook observing a stick in one of their hands was curious to know how he used it and having made himself understood one of them set up a piece of wood at the distance of yards and threw at it but with no great dexterity on which Omai to shew how much superior our weapons were to theirs fired his musket at it  It was not long however before the girl we had first seen returned and with her several women some with children on their backs tied by a kind of hempen strings and some without children These were likewise kindly received and led to the place where the wooders were at work with whom it was not long before they became acquainted They were however most miserable looking objects and Omai though led by natural impulse to an inordinate desire for women was so disgusted with them that he fired his piece in the air to frighten them from his sight which for that time had the desired effect  Capt Cook's reason for Omai's firing his piece as above was no doubt the true one tho' it was very natural for our Journalist who heard the report and saw the effect to assign the reason he did not knowing any other  On the th we extended our excursions still farther into the country and found it beautifully  diversified with hills and vallies stately groves of trees rivers meadows and lawns of vast extent with thickets full of birds of the most beautiful plumage parrots and paroquets and birds of various notes whose melody was truly enchanting besides these we found some lagoons full of ducks teal and other wild fowl of which we got great numbers while our Naturalists were loading themselves with the spontaneous productions of the soil a soil we may venture to say the richest and most fertile of any in the habitable globe the trees growing to an astonishing height and size and not more beautiful to the eye than they are grateful to the smell We found some that rose ninety feet high without a knot and of a girt that were we to report it would render the credit of the report doubtful It was now the time when Nature pours forth her luxuriant exuberance to clothe this country with every variety but what appeared strange to us the few natives we saw were wholly insensible of those blessings and seemed to live like the beasts of the forest in roving parties without arts of any kind sleeping in summer like dogs under the hollow sides of the trees or in wattled huts made with the low branches of evergreen shrubs stuck in the ground at small distances from each other and meeting in a point Mr Anderson observes that what the antient poets tell of  fawns  and  satyrs  living in hollow trees is here realized  Our fishermen were no less successful in fishing during our stay than our sportsmen in shooting wild fowl so that nothing was wanting to make our living here desirable  On the th the poor wretches of natives being now divested of their fears issued from the thickets like herds of deer from a forest and  drew themselves up in ranks on the beech making signs for our people to come on shore probably with a view to partake of our bounty certainly not with any design to do us any harm They were indeed armed with lances about twelve feet long terminated by a shark's tooth or piece of bone sharpened to a point which they threw to a great distance but to no great nicety These lances were the whole of their armour  There were among them as among all the inhabitants of the countries of the Southern Ocean some to whom the multitude seemed to pay obedience though even these were here without any marks of distinction other than what Nature had bestowed upon their persons This indelible dignity through all the classes of animal nature has marked some to rule while others destitute of that advantage willingly submit and are contented to obey To these Chiefs as no quadrupeds except a creature of the opossum kind about twice the bigness of a cat were seen in the country Capt Cook offered a boar and a sow but on their seizing them eagerly he found the creatures would have no chance of life he therefore resumed them and afterwards left them loose in the closest thicket he could find where it is possible they might have a better chance to breed than among the ferocious inhabitants of New Zealand where several of them formerly had been turned loose but very soon destroyed He also offered them nails knives beads and other trifles to which they paid little or no attention but were greedy after shreds of red cloth  It does not appear that the natives here are canibals or indeed that they feed much upon flesh as no appearance of any such food could be traced among them fowls only excepted Fish  fruit and the natural productions of the earth were the only articles of food that were observable about their fireplaces but what was still more strange there was neither canoe nor boat to be seen though the country abounded so much in timber It may therefore be reasonably concluded that these natives are a sort of fugitives who have been driven out from some more powerful community and subsist here in a state of banishment as it is hardly possible otherwise to conceive so fine a country possessed by a people wholly destitute of all the arts of civil life  It is true very different descriptions have been given of the persons of those poor wretches Capt Cook had formerly reported that their hair was strait and only clotted up with grease and nastiness while others insisted on their being woollyheaded tho' not quite so deeply coloured as the African blacks yet their skins are generally made so by a kind of paint The women are remarkably ugly  On the th having been here and on the coast near seven days and having got plenty of wood and water on board and whatever else the country afforded the signal was made for unmooring By ten in the morning the ships were under sail and at twelve Cape Frederic Henry bore N by W We set out with an easy gale but before night squalls came on which made it necessary to double reef our topsails and so to continue till break of day This gale was indicated by the barometer for the wind no sooner began to blow than the mercury in the tube began to fall  On the st of February we set our topgallant sails both ships in company steering a direct course for New Zealand and in nine days came  depiction of the people of Van Diemen's Land  A Man and Woman of Van Diemen's Land  p  in sight of Adventurer's Island distant about nine or ten leagues from Charlotte Sound  On the th we were off Charlotte's Bay our destined place of rendezvous  On the th in standing for the Sound the Discovery had the misfortune to strike upon a rock but by the assistance of the Resolution was warped off without receiving any considerable damage and about two in the afternoon both ships moored in nine fathom water  Not a man on board who did not now think himself at home so much like Great Britain is the island of New Zealand It is between six and seven hundred miles in length but varying in breadth being broadest towards the middle and narrowing at the extremities In this it seems to differ from the regular course of nature in the formation of islands and even of continents where like insects they seem to be divided in the middle and only connected together by an inconsiderable space Almost every island of any extent in the Southern Ocean is divided in this manner The continent of Europe Asia and Africa is held together by a thread in comparison at the isthmus of Suez and North and South America in like manner at that of Darien  We were no sooner securely moored in Charlotte Sound together with the Resolution than the natives came in droves to welcome our arrival to bring us fish and to offer to trade but every hand being then employed little or no notice was taken of their overtures some of our people were busy in carrying out the tents others in erecting them on shore some in forming intrenchments for the security of the stores and some in unshipping stores in short not an idle person being to be found to attend them the savages  thinking themselves neglected departed seemingly very much disappointed  For this behaviour Capt Cook assigns another cause This shyness he says was to be accounted for only upon this supposition that they were apprehensive we had revisited their country in order to revenge the death of Capt Furneaux's people  On the th we had hard squalls with heavy rain During the intervals of sunshine we observed several waterspouts but none near us Mr Forster who accompanied Capt Cook in his former voyage in his passage from Dusky Bay to this Sound had frequent opportunities of observing these phaenomena and has given the following description of them Their base he says where the water of the sea was violently agitated and rose in a spiral form in vapours was a broad spot which looked bright and yellowish when illuminated by the sun Directly over this spot a cloud gradually tapered into a long slender tube which seemed to descend to meet the rising spiral and soon united with it into a strait column of a cylindrical form We could distinctly observe the water hurled upwards with the greatest violence and it appeared that it left a hollow place in the centre He adds that these waterspouts made the oldest mariners uneasy all without exception had heard dreadful accounts of their pernicious effects when they happen to break over a ship but none had ever been so beset with them before  On the th at seven in the morning the pinnaces of both ships were ordered to be manned and both Captains went on shore with other gentlemen to reconnoitre the country without venturing too far at first for fear of a surprize Before  they landed they were observed by an old man who approached the shore holding a green bough in his hand and waving it in sign of peace which was instantly answered by hoisting a white flag Friendship being thus established we all landed and the old man began an oration accompanied by very significant gestures and a theatrical display of the passions by various modulations of his voice till at length he concluded in a plaintive tone which we interpreted to mean submission This done he saluted the company according to the custom of the southern islanders by joining noses a mode though not the most agreeable yet necessary to be complied with for the sake of peace Capt Cook more earnest to examine the state of the plantations which he had caused to be laid out and sowed with garden seeds in his former voyage than to pursue the sports of fishing and fowling which chiefly engaged the attention of other gentlemen while on shore went with Capt Clerke to visit the inclosures on Long Island and found many of the plants and roots in a flourishing condition though it did not appear that any care had been taken to dress or even to weed them by the natives Indeed it should seem that this part of the country like that of Dusky Bay is but thinly inhabited and probably occasionally only as none of their towns were found within any reasonable distance of the shore Some straggling huts indeed in which single families were found to reside were now and then discovered in the recesses of the woods but no regular plantations the effects of industry were observable in any part of this sound Their canoes and their clothing were works of great labour but where the former was performed could only be guessed at  though it appeared that the latter was the sole employment of their women  During our residence here though nothing was to to be found but vegetables and fish such was the plenty of both that loads of the former were to be procured for the labour of cutting and carrying away and of the latter as much as was sufficient for the sustenance of one person a whole day for a single nail  It had been observed by former Voyagers that the women in this island were chaster when first visited by our people than those in the warmer climates probably owing to the physical effects of their colder constitutions not to the restriction of any law or the force of custom nor to that delicacy of sentiment that naturally excites those sympathetic sensations that in a more advanced state of refinement serve to bind the sexes in the indelible bonds of mutual fidelity But to whatever cause it might be owing before the looser passions by their commerce with the European sailors took root among them those passions have been found to thrive so well that they now exceed all others in indulging them Even the men are now become so abandoned as to prostitute their very wives for a nail and to lay no restraint on their daughters of whom the men make little account  It was no sooner known that our ships were moored in Charlotte Sound than the natives flocked from the remotest corners of the island to traffic for nails broken glass beads or other European trumpery for which they would sell their arms clothes and whatever else they were possessed of not even reserving their working implements which they could not replace without infinite labour  The women who accompanied these commercial emigrants were no less saleable than the wares they brought and the favours of many were purchased by the seamen who though the first price was trifling cost them dear in the end This traffic was carried to a shameful height and Omai who from natural inclination and the licentious habits of his country felt no restraint indulged his almost insatiable appetite with more than savage indecorum  Before our present arrival it had been questioned even by Capt Cook whether these islanders would sell their children to strangers but experience has now taught us that there is nothing they will not sell for iron so great is their desire for that metal The love of gold is not more prevalent in Europe than the love of iron in New Zealand The story which Capt Cook relates in proof of the irresistible force of Nature in the retentive care of their children only shews that he himself had erred in the conclusions he had drawn from it for the Captain lived to see that the favourable opinion he had conceived of the natural affection of these savages for their children was not well founded  On the th in the morning several natives came along side the Resolution to trade as usual Then it was that Omai who was plentifully furnished with every kind of iron ware displayed his merchandize to the greatest advantage The savages inflamed with the richness of the exhibition perfectly trembled as they stood and were ready to board the ship at the peril of their lives to make themselves masters of what appeared to them so vast a treasure This to an European to whom nails broken glass and shreds of red  cloth are of little or no value may seem exaggerated but to those who have traversed the globe and marked the impetuosity of the passions of savages when excited to a certain pitch will rather wonder how they could be restrained than that they should be ready to commit any desperate action to possess themselves of those things which appeared of so much value in their eyes Omai though but one degree above the savage whom he despised yet had cunning enough to take advantage of the desires he had excited and after purchasing from them every article that suited him be artfully asked one party of them if they would sell their boat to which they readily consented Observing two promising youths on board with another party he asked the father if he would not part with his boys The youths looked with eagerness at their father as if they wished to follow the man that was so rich and the father seemingly as willing to part with the lads as they were to go replied in the affirmative and the bargain was instantly struck Thus for two hatchets and a few nails he purchased two fine boys the eldest named Tibura Taweiharooa about years old and the youngest called Gowah Kokoa about ten  On the th Capt Cook says the th the Captains of both ships with other officers and gentlemen embarked on board the Pinnace attended by a party of marines well armed and directed their course to the NorthWest round Cannibalbay for Long Island and Grass Cove there they visited the spot where the boat's crew belonging to the Adventure was murdered four years before but did not find any trace of that horrid massacre remaining nor any native from whom they might learn the cause  Here our Journalist appears to be ill informed Capt Cook here found Pedro an old friend who in his former voyages was almost always with him who received him on the beech and shewed him the very spot where the bloody scene was acted What they could learn from him was that while our people were sitting at dinner surrounded by natives some of the latter snatched from them some bread and fish for which they were beat This being resented a quarrel ensued and two New Zealanders were shot dead with the only two muskets that were fired for before they could be loaded again the natives rushed upon them overpowered them by numbers and put them all to death Pedro also shewed them where the boat lay about yards from the place where the massacre was committed the care of which had been entrusted to a black servant to Capt Furneaux The Captain was afterwards told that the negro was the cause of the quarrel which happened thus One of the natives attempting to steal something out of the boat the black gave him a severe blow with a stick and the cries of the fellow being heard by his countrymen they immediately began the attack on our people who before they could recover their arms from the boat fell sacrifices to the fury of their savage assailants Both these accounts Capt Cook thinks might be true as they perfectly coincide and he seems clear that there was no premeditated design of murder till the quarrel began though upon his first arrival he was shewn the Chief  who headed the party that cut our people to pieces  and who himself killed Mr Rowe the officer who commanded This fellow's name was Kahoora whom Capt Cook was often solicited to kill  Omai who could scarce make himself understood nor indeed could he understand the natives so well as many of the common men who had been frequently here before yet being a favourite of Capt Cook was always preferred when in company to confer with the natives and was desired by him when he met any of them alone to question them concerning the fray that had happened some years before and from what cause it had taken its rise and he was the more desirous to come at the truth as the natives in general were friendly and ready to furnish the ships with whatever their country afforded But from what Omai was able to learn Capt Cook received no satisfaction It should seem that in Otaheita there are two dialects spoken as in almost every other part of the world one by the priests and chiefs and another by the common people This was apparent here for Tupia who accompanied Mr Banks to this place in Capt Cook's second voyage round the world could converse with the natives fluently and was in such esteem with them that his memory is held in veneration from one end of the island to the other at this day Obedee likewise who was of the class of Areoes or gentlemen and who accompanied Capt Cook in his last voyage from Otaheite to the Thrum Isles the Hebrides New Zealand Easter Island and the Marquisses could converse with the New Zealanders though Omai could not a proof that he was of the inferior class in his own country  While he continued here he found frequent opportunities to discover his real character when from under the watchful eye of his protector and friend He had grog always at his command and was sometimes entrusted to give it out especially  when any extra quantity was to be delivered by the Captain's orders for hard service or on days of festivity At those times he was closely watched and was never known to exceed but now when the Captain was abroad for whole days and nights and he left in charge of liquors he set no bounds to his excess and would drink till he wallowed like a swine in his own filth At those times he outacted the savage in every kind of sensuality and when he could no longer act the brute he would often act the drunken man storming roaring brandishing his arms and by the contorsions of his mouth and face setting at defiance after the manner of his country the whole host of his enemies who were represented by the common sailors with whom upon these occasions he was generally surrounded and who knew how to practise upon him as he endeavoured to do upon the poor Zealanders He was indeed far from being illnatured vindictive or morose but he was sometimes sulky He was naturally humble but had grown proud by habit and it so ill became him that he was always glad when he could put it off and could appear among the petty officers with his natural ease This was the true character of Omai who might be said perhaps by accident to have been raised to the highest pitch of human happiness only to suffer the opposite extreme by being again reduced to the lowest order of rational beings  In the excursion of the two Captains among the isles plentiful provision was made for the live stock on board and the long boats of both ships came heavily laden home with grass for the cattle and vegetables for the ship's companies from the gardens of Motuara and Long Island which were found to remain in a flourishing though  slovenly condition To the quadrupeds which the Captains Cook and Furneaux had left to breed in the island in their former voyages our Captains added two goats a male and female with kid and two pigs a boar and a sow those that had been left before of this species having died almost as soon as sent on shore  Wooding watering airing the stores drying and new packing the powder examining and new baking the damaged bread forging bolts and new pintles for the rudders with other necessary business for repairs of the ship were continued without intermission on shore By the absence of so many useful hands smiths armourers gunners carpenters rope and sailmakers with their attendants very few people were left on board to take charge of the ships nothing being apprehended from the attempts of the natives who had hitherto behaved with unexampled honesty hardly any complaints having been preferred against any of them for misbehaviour of any kind  In this situation with scarce men enough on board to hand the sails a storm arose in the morning of the th which before ten o'clock drove the Discovery from her moorings and it was owing to Providence that having run foul of the Resolution she did not perish the surge carrying her off instantaneously with little damage to either ship All hands on board were thrown into the utmost consternation No sooner was she clear than we dropped the best bower anchor got down the topgallant yards struck the topgallant masts and lowered the yards got in the cables and moored with best bower and sheet anchors and thus fortunately rode out the storm Mr Blythe master of the Resolution and Mr Bentham our Captain's clerk seeing the danger the  ships were in and at the hazard of their lives attempting to get on board in a canoe were overset but providentially recovered by the boats from the ships The gale continuing the whole day no Indians came to trade  It should have been remembered that from the time of landing our brewers began brewing and the woods affording plenty of spruce the crews of both ships were supplied with this wholesome beverage during our continuance at New Zealand and for several weeks after we were at sea This liquor was found so salutary that it seemed to strike at the very root of the scurvy and left not the least symptom of it remaining about any man in the ships  Indeed great care was taken to supply the crews daily with plenty of scurvygrass and wild celery to boil with their portable soup and saltmeat was withheld and fish substituted in its room This last the Indians abundantly provided at a trifling expence and what is not a little surprising when our fishers could catch the least they generally caught the most tho' their implements shewed infinitely less ingenuity in the construction than those with which our people were furnished It is not easy to say by what arts they allured the fish but certainly some means were used by them to which we were strangers nor could they ever be prevailed upon to discover their secret  During our stay in Charlotte Sound an adventure happened which though the parties were not of the highest class may notwithstanding be worth relating  Belonging to the Discovery there was a youth with whom a young Zealander girl about fourteen years of age fell desperately in love nor was she wholly indifferent to our adventurer What time  he could spare he generally retired with her and they spent the day but oftener the night in a kind of silent conversation in which tho' words were wanting their meaning was perfectly understood Moments fly rapidly on that are spent in mutual endeavours to please She on her part had no will but his and he in return was no less attentive to her's Minds so disposed naturally incline to render themselves agreeable A conformity in manners and dress become significant signs between lovers Though he appeared amiable in her eyes in the dress of a stranger yet he wished to render himself still more so by ornamenting his person after the fashion of her country accordingly he submitted to be tattowed from head to foot nor was she less solicitous to set herself off to the best advantage She had fine hair and her chief pride was in the dress of her head The pains she took and the decorations she used would have done honour to an European beauty had not one thing been wanting to render it still more pleasing Ghowannahe that was her name though young was not so delicate but that the traits of her country might be traced in her locks To remedy this misfortune and to render it less offensive she was furnished with combs and taught by her lover how to use them After being properly prepared he would by the hour amuse himself with forming her hair into ringlets which flowing carelessly round her neck with a kind of coronet rising from her temples gave her an air of dignity that added fresh charms to the brilliancy of her eyes The distaste arising from colour gradually wore off and the ardent desire of rendering their sentiments more and more intelligible to each other gave rise to a new language consisting of words looks  gestures and inarticulate tones by which pleasure and pain were more forcibly expressed than by the most refined speech Having at first acquired the art of imparting their passions they very soon improved it to the story of their lives Love and jealousy directed her enquiries concerning the women of the world from whence he came wishing at the same time that he would stay with her and be a  Kakikoo  or Chief He made her to understand that the women in his world were all  tatoo  mankillers and if he stayed with her she would kill him She answered no she would  ehna row  love him He said her people would kill him She replied no if he did not shoot  them  He made her to understand that nine or ten of the men of his world had been killed and eaten by her people tho' they did not shoot them Her answer was that was a great while ago and the people came from the hills  roä roä  meaning a great way off This excited his curiosity to know if any of her relations were among the murderers she sighed and appeared much affected when he asked her that question He asked her if she was at the feast when they broiled and eat the men she wept and looking wishfully at him hung down her head He became still more pressing as she grew more reserved He tried every winning way that love and curiosity suggested to learn from her what he found she knew and what she seemed so determined to conceal But she artfully evaded all his questions He asked her why she was so reserved She pretended not to understand him He repeated the same question and why she kept him in the dark at the same time closing his eyes and keeping them shut She continued to weep but made him no answer Finding all his persuasions ineffectual  he turned from her seemingly in anger and threatened to leave her She caught him round the neck in violent agitation He asked her what she meant and why she wept She said they would kill her if she told He said they should not know it Then He would hate her she said He answered no but love her more and more pressing her to his bosom at the same time She grew more composed and said she would tell him all she knew She then made him understand that one Gooboa Kahoora according to Capt Cook a bad man who had been often at the ship and had stolen many things when he came to know that it was preparing to depart went up into the hill country to the hippah and invited the warriors to come down and kill the strangers They at first refused saying the strangers were stronger than they and would kill them with their  pow pow  or firearms he told them they need not fear for he knew where they must come before they departed in order to get grass for their  goury  or cattle and that on such occasions they left their  pow pow  behind them in the ship or carelessly about the ground while they were at work They said they were no enemies but friends and they must not kill men with whom they were in friendship Kahoora said they were vile enemies and wicked men and complained of their chaining him and beating him and shewed them the marks and bruises he had received at the ship and told them besides how they might silence their  pow pow  by only throwing water over them and then they could not hurt them Kahoora undertook to conduct them in safety to the place where the strangers were to come and shewed them where they might conceal themselves till he should come  and gave them notice which he did And when the men were busy about getting grass and not thinking any harm the warriors rushed out upon them and killed them with their patapatows and then divided their bodies among them  This Kahoora was so bad a man that Capt Cook was often solicited to kill him by the natives and Omai having introduced him into the Captain's cabin for that purpose saying There is Kahoora kill him as soon as he had said this retired He had often asked the Captain's permission to kill him himself but when it was in his power so to do he instantly got out of the way A short time after says Capt Cook he returned and seeing the Chief unhurt he expostulated with me very earnestly saying  "You tell me if a man kills another in England he is hanged for it This man has killed ten and yet you would not kill him tho' many of his countrymen desire it and it would be very good"  The Captain desired Omai to ask the Chief why he killed Capt Furneaux's people At this question he hung down his head and looked like one caught in a trap and expected instant death but he was no sooner assured of his safety than he became chearful He did not however seem willing to answer the question till he was again and again assured that he should not be hurt and then he said that one of his countrymen having brought a stone hatchet to barter the man to whom it was offered took it and would neither pay for it nor give it him back on which the owner snatched up the bread as an equivalent and then the quarrel began These stories are by no means so probable as that told by the girl who makes the massacre the premeditated design of Kahoora Else why such a number of the savages together  in an unfrequented place and all arm'd too had they not come with an ill design But to proceed with our narrative  Ghowannahe added that there were women as well as men concerned and that the women made the fires while the warriors cut the dead men in pieces that they did not eat them all at once but only their hearts and livers that the warriors had the heads which were esteemed the best and the rest of the flesh was distributed among the crowd Having by various questions in the course of several days extorted this relation of which he said he had no reason to doubt the truth he forbore to ask her what part her relations and herself bore in this tragedy as there was reason to believe they were all equally concerned He was however very solicitous to learn if any such plot was now in agitation against the people that might be sent upon the same service to Grass Cove or any other convenient place Her answer was no the warriors were afraid at first that the ships were come to revenge the death of their friends and that was the reason why she was forbidden to speak of killing the strangers or to own any knowledge of it if she were asked about any such thing She said she was but a child not years old but she remembered the talk of it as a gallant action or great atchievement and that they made songs in praise of it  In the course of his conversation with this girl who seemed rather of the better sort he learned many things concerning the natural temper of the natives that had escaped the penetration of former Voyagers and likewise with respect to their domestic policy She said the people of T'AviPoenammoo or the Southern division of the island were a fierce bloody people and had a  natural hatred to the people of Eaheinomauwe and killed them when he found them at any time in their country but that the people of Eaheinomauwe were a good people and were friendly to one another but never suffered any of the people of T'AviPoenammoo to settle among them because they were enemies that they sometimes employed them to work for them but that the two nations the people on the North part of the Sound and those on the South were ever at war and eat one another She added that the people of either country when they fought never eat one another so that it should seem that habitual antipathy has a great share in the tendency of these savages to become meneaters With respect to their domestic policy she said the fathers had the sole care of the boys as soon as they could walk and that the girls were left wholly at the mother's disposal She said it was a crime for a mother to correct her son after he was once taken under the protection of the father and that it was always resented by the mother if the father interfered in the management of the daughters She said the boys from their infancy were trained to war and both boys and girls were taught the art of fishing to weave their nets and make their hooks and lines that their canoes came from a far country and that they got them in exchange for cloth which was chiefly manufactured by the women that their arms and working tools descended from father to son and that those that were taken in battle supplied the rising generation that they had no Kings among them but that they had men who conversed with the dead who were held in great veneration and consulted before the people went to the wars that they were the men who addressed strangers that  a me upon the coast first in the language of peace at the first time denouncing vengeance against them if they came with any hostile design that the persons of these men were held sacred and never killed in the wars which ever side prevailed that when the warriors of either nation made prisoners they were never of the meaner sort but of some Chief whom they afterwards killed and eat but that to the common sort they never gave quarter that they sometimes tortured an enemy if they found him singly lurking in the woods looking upon him as one who came upon no good design but never otherwise that they lived chiefly upon fish which were caught in the Sound in abundance during the summer and were dried and preserved for the winter but that in very severe weather they retired to the North  The account given by Mr Anderson Surgeon and Naturalist to the Resolution corresponds in every respect with the information which our Journalist received from his favourite girl The children says Mr Anderson are initiated at an early age into all the practices good or bad of their fathers so that you find a boy or girl nine or ten years old able to perform all the motions and to imitate the frightful gestures which the more aged use to inspire their enemies with terror keeping the strictest time in their song They likewise sing with some degree of melody the traditions of their forefathers their actions in war and other indifferent subjects of all which they are immoderately fond and spend much of their time in these amusements and playing on a sort of flute  No people can have a quicker sense of injury nor any more ready to resent it but this Mr  Anderson thinks may be looked upon as the effect rather of a savage disposition than of genuine bravery Their public contentions are frequent or rather perpetual and it appears from their number of weapons and their dexterity in using them that war is their principal profession Before they begin the onset they join in a war song to which they all keep the exactest time and soon raise their passion to a degree of fury attended with the most horrid distortions of their eyes mouth and tongues to strike terror into their enemies which to those who have not been accustomed to such a practice makes them appear more like daemons than men and would almost chill the boldest with fear To this succeeds a circumstance almost foretold in their fierce demeanour horrid cruel and disgraceful to human nature which is cutting in pieces even before being perfectly dead the bodies of their enemies and after dressing them on a fire devouring the flesh not only without reluctance but with peculiar satisfaction  Being asked if they ever eat the bodies of their friends they seemed surprised at the question and expressed some abhorrence at the idea No people on earth appear to lament the loss of friends with more tender concern than the New Zealanders they bewail them with the most doleful cries tearing their hair and cutting their faces till they mingle their blood with their tears  They chiefly live by fishing and the only furniture of their houses are buckets and bags wherein they keep their fishinghooks they are seldom stationary but remove from place to place and it is astonishing with what facility they build their houses Capt Cook was present while they  built a village The moment the canoes reached the shore the men leapt out and at once took possession of a piece of ground by tearing up the plants and shrubs and sticking up some part of the framing of a hut They then returned to their canoes and secured their weapons by placing them so as they could reach them in an instant They then began to arrange the materials some of which they brought with them the rest they got upon the spot and while the men were thus employed the women were not idle some were placed to watch the canoes others to secure the provisions and others to find fuel to dress their food Thus in a few hours they had houses to sleep in and fire to dress their suppers  They generally chose to be near the tents and took up their abode close to them The seamen Capt Cook says had in general taken a dislike to those people and seldom would associate with them and indeed there was good reason They were both loathsome in their persons and diet Train oil was a most delicious feast to them the scourings of the lamps and even the remnants of the wicks were voraciously devoured by them When the sailors were melting their seal blubber the skimmings of the pots and the dregs of the casks were frequently fought for by the byestanders  Though they are in an eternal state of warfare among themselves yet if a stranger comes among them of whom they have no suspicion they are received and kindly entertained as long as they have any business to transact but no longer Thus it is that a trade is carried on among them by way of exchange of one thing for another The most precious material is green talc of the  origin of which they have many superstitious stories one that it was originally a fish and the good spirit when he is pleased forms it into a stone It is only to be found in one isle They have certainly a notion of rewards and punishments and a future state they believe that the soul of the Chief who is killed in war and is eaten by the enemy is doomed to everlasting fire while the soul of the Chief who conquers in battle and dies a natural death ascends among the good spirits who have the power of bestowing victory as the reward of valour It does not appear however that they have any settled system of religion they have no  morai's  nor any ceremonies at the interment of their departed friends but they frequently carve miniature figures in stone which they ornament with eyes of pearl and hang about their necks as memorials of those who were dearest to them while they lived They have too their days of abstinence and their modes of supplicating the good spirit and deprecating the evil one but they could not be comprehended Madan's system of marriage was discoverable among them whoever first took a virgin kept to her for life and there were many who appeared to have more women than one dependent on them parental affection was characteristic among them and there appeared no other subordination except that which originated from filial duty Their Chiefs seemed all descendants from the same stock branched out like the ramifications of a tree from one root which united constituted one tribe  Mr Anderson in the natural history of this country is very copious The soil he says is best indicated by the luxuriant growth of its productions The hills with some exceptions near the  shores are one continued forest of lofty trees flourishing beyond conception The happy temperature of the climate contributes not a little to this uncommon strength of vegetation There are no marks of devastation by hurricanes nor of torrents rushing from the mountains by excessive rains The country is in general mountainous and the vallies watered by brooks and rivulets and as it is by nature ill adapted for improvement by the plough there does not appear the least trace of cultivation  The large trees that cover the hills are chiefly of two sorts one not unlike in growth to the Northern firs the other like our maple both sorts were cut for fuel being found too heavy for masts and yards There were likewise a species of  Philadelphus  the leaves of which were drank for tea and was an excellent substitute for the Oriental sort  Among the plants wild celery and a sort of scurvygrass were found the most salutary a fedgelike plant of which the natives make their garments was likewise noticed by Mr Anderson and much commended of all these and many more we brought home the seeds  Of the birds there was a tolerable stock but rather shy among them he mentions a musical bird when by itself was sufficient to fill the woods with melody though small it was enchanting Another curious bird Mr Anderson mentions with a long tail which on approaching it spreads it like a fan  Among other birds they killed were two or three rails as large as common fowls but no other game one single snipe excepted  The fish in the Sound were of various kinds many of them excellent and furnished by the  natives in great abundance a fish called by the natives  magge  and by the seamen  seabreams  small salmons and colefish were superior to the rest  Shellfish about the rocks were in such plenty that the natives seem in a great measure to live upon them when the weather is such that they cannot get out to sea They have muscles a foot long crayfish cockles small oysters and a variety of other rockfish periwincles and crabs  Insects are not numerous but some there are that were very troublesome as scorpionflies and sandflies as venomous as musquitoes  Among the reptiles a kind of lizard is mentioned eight feet in length and as big round as a man's body they burrow in the ground and as one of the Zealand youths that embarked with Omai affirmed sometimes seize and devour men  There were no traces of any fourfooted animal to be seen rats and a kind of foxdogs excepted on which the priests and the chiefs sometimes but seldom feasted It is not a little remarkable that neither metal nor mineral were discoverable on the island the green jasper only excepted  The Zealanders in general do not exceed the common stature of Europeans some indeed are remarkable for their large bones and muscular strength but of these few were seen their faces are round their eyes full their lips plump and their noses as the phrase is bottled Mr Anderson does not remember to have seen the true aqualine nose among them though if we remember right Mr Parkinson's chief is an exception Their teeth were commonly large white and well set their hair black and lank and their persons  altogether  tolerably proportioned but  few graceful or strikingly wellmade The women in general are ordinary and forbidding The dress of both sexes is the same consisting of a kind of cloth made of silky flax which nature has provided for them and which they have improved by bleaching dying and knotting They bring two corners of this cloth over their shoulders and fasten it on the breast and round their waist with a girdle some ornament these with the fur of dogskin and others with the feathers of birds wrought into the cloth as it is made For cloaks they use a kind of matting which they throw loosely over them so as to cover them when they sit from head to foot and when so covered it is not easy to distinguish them from grey stones by which means they form ambushes in war and fall upon the enemy by surprize Their colour is naturally a very darkbrown but they rather affect to make it appear black their beards grow long but they shave to make way for punctuating their faces which whether a mark of distinction or only intended for ornament must be a painful and tedious operation  As mechanics they certainly excel their canoes are masterpieces of mechanical labour and their cordage is equal to that of Europe their lines their nets their fishingtackle and in short every thing useful in common life is fabricated and finished to admiration their carving considering their tools they have to work with is beyond conception elegant"  On the d in the morning the old Indian who had harangued the ship when we approached the shore came on board the Discovery and presented the Captain with a compleat stand of their arms and some very fine fish which were  kindly received and in return the Captain gave him a brass patapatow made exactly in their manner on which were engraven his Majesty's name and arms the names of the ships the date of their departure from England and the business they were sent upon he gave him likewise a hatchet a few nails a knife and some glass ornaments which he highly prized tho' of small value This day the woodcutters lost a woodax which one of the natives dexterously carried off without being discovered In the evening they brought a man bound whom they offered to sell but their offer being rejected they carried him back and in the night a most horrid yelling was heard in the woods which excited the curiosity of the gentlemen on board our ship to examine into the cause The cutter was ordered to be manned a party of marines were armed to be put on board and the Captain with proper attendants directed their course to the west side of the bay where they saw several fires just lighted and where they hoped to have surprized the natives before they had put their poor captive to death but in this hope they were disappointed perhaps he was reserved for a better fate The savages in an instant disappeared and left no trace behind them of any slaughter having been committed  About four in the morning the tents were struck and orders delivered out for sailing  Next day Feb th the Indians flocked in great numbers about the ship bringing with them a plentiful supply of fish and whatever else they thought marketable among the sailors  Though the natives appeared friendly during our stay it was judged proper to keep the time of our departure secret till all things were on  board and we were in readiness to sail This precaution Capt Cook thought the more necessary from what he had just heard of the treachery of the savages By not allowing them to concert any new plot he effectually secured our foraging parties from the danger of a surprize and by thus suddenly giving orders to sail he prevented our own men from rambling after the women when their business was done which tho' not  overfond  of Zealanders they never failed to do when in their power The foraging parties here meant are those who were sent to the coves at the distance perhaps of six or seven leagues from the ships to cut grass for the live stock and to gather herbs to boil with the portable soup for the men and those also who were stationed in the woods to get spruce to brew into beer for their preservation from the scurvy against which that liquor as has already been observed was found a most powerful antidote The tree the leaves and berries of which they made their spruce was as large according to Mr Anderson as our largest firs but their tops more like the yew Of grass and herbs an immense quantity was brought on board and of spruce as much as served the crews for drink near thirty days during which time no grog was delivered out The parties ordered upon these services went always well armed and guarded by marines though Capt Cook himself entertained very high notions of the honour as well as bravery of the New Zealanders  It was about seven in the morning when the ships cleared the bay and about eleven when they entered the mouth of Cook's Streights where they cast anchor and Capt Clerke and Mr Burney his first Lieutenant went on board the Resolution to dine with Capt Cook Here  the friends of the two Zealander youths whom Omai had purchased came to take their last leave of them and expressed very affectingly their grief at parting though the boys were as yet in pretty good spirits Some presents were made by Omai to the parents and they departed seemingly with great reluctance  On the th Kahoora with his whole family came on board the Resolution without the least apprehensions of danger or fear for his life such confidence had Capt Cook's behaviour inspired among the New Zealanders that they looked upon his word as sacred he now answered all the questions that were put to him without reserve Mr Burney who the next day after the massacre was sent with an armed party to Grass Cove fired several vollies among the crowds of cannibals assembled about the detestable banquet and it was natural to suppose that many of them had felt the effects of his just resentment but Kahoora declared that not a single person was hurt  On the th both ships came to sail and on the th cleared the land lat long E  On the st of March a storm came on but as the wind was fair we got down the top gallantyards closereefed the topsails and pursued our course E by N About four in the afternoon it cleared up we spoke with the Resolution and all well except the two New Zealanders who notwithstanding their constant residence on the margin of the main ocean and their employment of fishing near the shores from their infancy yet when they came to leave the land and seeing nothing but foaming billows all  round them their hearts failed them they now began to pine and refused to eat  On the d the wind continuing fair and the breeze moderate Capt Clerke with Mr Burney went on board the Resolution to dine with Capt Cook When the New Zealanders were told there was a boat come on board whatever their apprehensions then were it was not easy to discover but they ran and hid themselves and seemed to be in a great panic It did not appear that their fear took its rise from the thoughts of being carried back because when the gentlemen were coming away they wanted to come with them It should rather seem therefore that they were apprehensive of some design upon their lives as in their country a consultation among the chiefs always precedes a determined murder This was in part confirmed by their behaviour afterwards This day we were in lat S long E Nothing remarkable till  The th when a great swell from the Southward gave notice of an approaching storm Albatrosses men of war birds flying fish dolphins and sharks had played about the ships for several days and some of our gentlemen had shot albatrosses that measured eleven feet from tip to tip and this day a large shark was caught most of which was eaten by the ship's company though they had not yet lost the relish of the New Zealand fish nor were their stores quite exhausted most of the sailors having purchased quantities to salt which were esteemed excellent Lat obs S long E course E by N  On the th the storm that was foreseen came on accompanied with thunder lightning and  rain The sea rose mountains high and the wind increased to such a degree as made it necessary to take in almost all our sails with the utmost expedition

and split our foretopmaststaysail in a thousand shreds At night we shifted our course and stood N by E ½ E There were some on board who disapproved of the course we had steered from the beginning foreseeing that by going so fast to the Northward we should fall too suddenly into the tradewinds especially if we should be met by an Easterly wind before we approached the Tropic Among the seamen on board a king's ship there  are always some expert navigators whose judgment ripened by experience is much to be depended upon but the misfortune is that these men are never consulted nor do they even dare so much as to whisper their opinion to their superior officer Like gamesters standing by they can see the errors of the game but must not point them out till the game is over This was the real case on board the Discovery some of whose people did not scruple to foretel what would happen the moment we left the th degree of Southern latitude while we were yet only in the th degree of Eastern longitude They did not scruple to say among themselves that instead of degrees short of the longitude of Otaheite which lies in ° E nearly before we altered our latitude to the North we ought to have stretched at least degrees farther Eastward being then certain that how far soever we might be to the Eastward of our intended port when we came to cross the Tropic we should be sure of a fair wind to carry us to it Lat this day obs long  This remark now appears in its full force Capt Cook's words are  "the hopes of the wind coming more Southerly or of meeting with it from the Westward a little without the Tropics encouraged me to continue this course Indeed it was necessary that I should run all risks"  c  On the th having continued our course N N E for the last twentyfour hours we found ourselves in lat deg min by observation and in long E that is more than degrees to the Westward of Otaheite Here we saw seaweed in abundance and by a large tree floating by us we judged we could not be far  from land but found none The tree appeared to be about thirty feet long and of a considerable girt and by its freshness seemed not to have been long in the water  The st when in the latitude of degrees South we saw a large whale at a little distance a sight seldom seen in so low a latitude in the northern hemisphere This day our beer which had been periodically brewed from the spruce brought from New Zealand was all exhausted and grog served out in its stead Hitherto not a man was ill on board the Discovery nor any other alteration made in their allowance It was the number of live stock on board the Resolution that occasioned the distress for water from which the Discovery was in a manner exempt having but few on board more than were necessary for the ship's use  On the d the heaviest rain began to pour down that any man on board had ever known It fell in sheets and as the wind increased the men in handling the sails were in the utmost danger of being washed off the yards It continued for six hours incessantly It came however most seasonable for the Resolution where the number of live stock horses cows goats and sheep had exhausted a large proportion of their fresh water and we were yet at a great distance from our destined port Here the wind began to veer to the East as we approached the Tropic This was apprehended by many who finding our longitude not to increase in proportion as our latitude decreased began to suspect that we should not be able to make Otaheite this run Course N by E wind S E by S Lat long  On the d the weather continuing we began to be accompanied by our tropical companions  many of which surrounded the ship and one man of war bird had the audacity to settle on the masthead  On the th course N by E the wind E by S  On the th our latitude was decreased to deg min without our longitude being increased one single degree The wind E S E and our course N E by N we made but little way to the Eastward But the weather continuing fair Capt Clerke and Mr Burney went on board the Resolution to dine with Capt Cook and when they returned brought the sorrowful news of the alarming situation of the Resolution for want of provisions and water for the live stock that they were obliged to kill a great part of their sheep hogs and goats for the use of the crew not having a sufficient quantity of food and water to keep them alive that the horses and cows were mere skeletons being reduced to the scanty portion of four pounds of hay and six quarts of water for twentyfour hours and the men put to the allowance of two quarts of water for the same space of time that the wind still continuing foul all thoughts of reaching Otaheite were laid aside and that the isles of Amsterdam and Rotterdam were now our only resource The above facts and important observations are omitted by Capt Cook which notwithstanding are ill implied and shews not only the accuracy of our journalist but the superiority of his judgment in foreseeing and foretelling what would be the issue of such a  desperate  course Nothing remarkable till  The th when the weather which for two or three days had been squally attended with thunder and lightning increased to a storm so  depiction of the people of Mangea  A Man of Mangea  p  depiction of the people of Eaoo  A Woman of Eaoo  p  that it became necessary for us to hand our sails one after another till our doublereefed topsails were all that were abroad We now saw seaweed in abundance and some landfowl began to make their appearance which were indications of land at no great distance Course N E by N to N N E Lat obs long  On the th the tempestuous weather still continuing we altered our course to the North The wind for the last twentyfour hours blowing mostly from the S E We this day crossed the Southern Tropic on the th according to Capt Cook when the weather cleared up and we were saluted with a fine breeze and attended by numerous shoals of flying fish bonitos dolphins sharks and whole flocks of Tropical seafowl which abound near the islands in the low latitudes but are seldom seen in the deep Pacific Sea  On the th about ten in the morning the sky being clear and the weather moderate the man at the masthead called out Land bearing N E distant about seven or eight leagues We made the signal which was soon answered by the Resolution About the weather began to alter and to blow in gusts from the land At four in the afternoon tacked ship and stood in for the land Saw no sign of inhabitants while daylight remained but in the night observed several fires Lat long  On the th saw several canoes approaching the ships and many inhabitants on the beach seemingly in arms to oppose our landing About ten the boats were hoisted out and manned in order to reconnoitre the shore and sound for anchorage who to our great disappointment returned without having succeeded  Two of the canoes came within call having three persons in each canoe but none of them could be prevailed upon to come on board Our Captain shewed many articles of European manufacture to excite their curiosity but they seemed to set little value on any thing except New Zealand cloth of which he threw a piece overboard and they came and dived for it but they had no sooner recovered it than they paddled off as fast as they could without offering any thing in return In the mean time the boats were surrounded by multitudes from the shore who came some in canoes and some swimming they even attempted to board the boats by force and several fastened round them with their teeth Thus circumstanced and in danger of being sunk they chose rather to return to the ships than hazard their own safety or to secure themselves deprive any of the innocent people of life an injunction that was frequently repeated by Capt Cook during the voyage and which was the more necessary as the common sailors were very apt to forget that the life of an Indian was of any account About noon the Resolution being in much distress for water though somewhat relieved by the rains which had fallen Capt Cook ordered the cutter to be manned and went in it himself to talk with the natives and to examine the coast but after a fruitless search was forced to return the surf being such as rendered the watering of the ships from the shore an absolute impossibility While he lay too he had some friendly conversation with the natives and some presents passed between them but nothing that answered the purposes of supplying the ships or refreshing the crews One of the natives to whom a  knife was given instantly run it through his ear and swam to shore though the surf rose to an astonishing height This person Capt Cook says had two polished pearlshells and a bunch of human hair loosely twisted hanging about his neck Great numbers came round to the beech overagainst which the Captain lay waving green branches in token of peace  This island which the natives called Mangya or Mangeea and the name of their chief Orooaeeka we supposed to be in length from S S W to N N E about eight leagues and in breadth about four leagues and to lie in latitude long made a most delightful appearance and as Capt Cook was made to understand abounded in every thing of which the ships were in want it may therefore easily be conceived with what reluctance we left it Some peculiarities were observed by those who attended Capt Cook particularly in the dress both of the men and women who wore a kind of sandals made of bark upon their feet on their heads caps probably of their own manufacture richly ornamented and encircled with partycoloured plumage They were above the middle stature most of them seemingly from five feet ten inches to six feet six inches wellmade tattowed and like those of the Friendly Isles were without clothes except a kind of apron which encircled their waists reaching little more than half way down their thighs Both men and women were armed with spears thirteen or fourteen feet long and the men had massy clubs besides about three feet long of a hard wood and very heavy Armed with these weapons or people were drawn up upon the beach who eagerly gazed at the ships having probably never seen an European vessel  before though this with the islands adjoining were discovered in Captain Cook's former voyage at the distance of seven or eight leagues Their canoes were of curious workmanship seemingly cut out of the solid wood polished and decorated with carvings that indicated both taste and design Their very paddles were polished and inlaid with shells as were most of their weapons of war Capt Cook's relation differs nothing in substance from the above  On the st before ten in the morning the man at the masthead called out land ahead distance seven or eight leagues lying N by E  Next morning April st we had got abreast of its North end At the same time another island was in view but much smaller we preferred the former as most likely to furnish a supply of food for the cattle of which we began to be in great want  At eleven we hauled in for the land but as there was but little wind and that unfavourable at eight next morning April d we were full two leagues to leeward  Observing several canoes hastening towards us waving green branches which we understood were ensigns of peace these we answered and one who appeared to be a chief came on board the Discovery with a large bough in his hand and another was seen to ascend the side of the Resolution After the usual ceremonies and some presents of little value had passed while Capt Clerke was endeavouring to make his wants known to the Indian Omai came on board by Capt Cook's direction who here could make himself perfectly understood The chief addressed him in a solemn speech which though Omai pretended to interpret  very little of it could be understood by any one else He then was introduced by Omai to the Captain to whom he presented his green bough at the same time inviting him ashore and promising to furnish him with whatever refreshments the island produced This invitation was accepted the boats were ordered out and the Captain with Omai and suitable attendants were instantly landed But what was Omai's surprize when among the crowd of spectators on the beach he saw or thought he saw some of his countrymen striving to come forward  At the distance of more than leagues with an immense ocean intervening by what miracle could men be brought so far who had no other vehicle of conveyance than wretched open boats that seldom can be trusted out of sight of land Omai could hardly believe his eyes and was eager to be convinced The strangers were three in number who were all equally surprized and equally impatient to hear Omai's adventures and Omai to know theirs Omai took them aside and entertained them with a pleasing relation of all that had happened to himself and they in return acquainted Omai with what had befallen them Their story was truly pitiable they said that of Uliteans they were the only survivors that about twelve years ago they with their families and friends going from Ulitea to settle at Otaheite were overtaken in a dreadful tempest by which they were driven into the main ocean that the storm continuing to increase and the sea to run mountains high the women and children were washed over board and perished before they experienced any further distress that after three days when the storm abated those who remained found themselves in an unknown  ocean with little more provisions than was just sufficient to serve them another day that having no pilot to direct their course nor any sign by which to steer they continued to go before the wind day after day till famine had reduced their number to less than fifteen that those who survived had nothing but the seaweed which they found floating in the sea and the water which they saved when it rained to keep them alive that ten days having elapsed and no land in prospect despair took place of hope and several unable to support the pangs of hunger jumped over board in their phrenzy and perished by an easy death the groans and lamentations of the dying and the terrible agonies with which some were affected before death came to their relief exceeded all description In this melancholy situation they had existed for thirteen days and how much longer they could have no recollection for they were taken up insensible of pain and hardly to be distinguished from the emaciated bodies of the dead among whom they were found seemingly without life or motion till by the friendly care of their deliverers they were restored When they recovered they said it was like waking from a dream they knew not where they were nor how they came upon land but being told that they were taken up at sea and in what condition as their senses gradually returned they by degrees recollected all the circumstances already related they added that ever since they were brought to life they had remained with their deliverers and were now quite reconciled to their condition and happy in the situation in which the Eatooa or good spirit had placed them Omai after hearing their relation with which he was apparently much affected told them they  might now take the opportunity of returning home with him that he would intercede for them and that he was sure if they chose it the chiefs of the expedition would grant his request They thanked Omai for his kindness nor had they any reason to suppose that such an offer would ever be made them again but they were now determined to end their days with the people who had restored them to second life and as their dearest relations and friends were of the number of those who perished the return to their own country would now only renew their grief and instead of offording them pleasure would but increase their melancholy This interview over Omai joined his associates and proceeded with Capt Clerke as his interpreter After hearing their story Omai returned to his company and Capt Clerke who had been joined by Lieutenant Gore from the Resolution held some conversation with the natives who received them in the most friendly manner and before their return to the ships a double canoe in which were twelve men was seen alongside the Resolution One of these men as they approached the ship stood up and repeated some words by way of recitatives and was soon joined by the rest in full chorus Their song was no sooner ended than they all went on board and one who appeared to be the chief presented Capt Cook with a pig a few cocoanuts and a piece of matting They were all admitted into the great cabin some objects seemed to strike them but none fixed their attention till they came to the sheep and goats The horses and cows evidently struck them with fear but the sheep and the goats came nearer to the level of their comprehension They knew they said they were birds They were dismissed with presents but  the chief went away seemingly dissatisfied He had set his heart upon a dog and accordingly early next morning a canoe was observed making towards the ship in which was a large hog some plantains and cocoanuts for Capt Cook for which the people in the canoe were to accept of nothing but a dog in exchange On board the Resolution one of the gentlemen had a dog and the dog's mate which had long been nuisances and which might now have been disposed of for a laudable purpose of propagating a race of useful animals among a friendly people however he thought otherwise but Omai spared them a dog and they returned highly gratified  Mr Gore on his return had reported to Capt Cook Omai's adventure with his three friends and had reported the state of the island to be such as to afford no supply of food for the cattle which were ready to starve unless they could be prevailed upon to bring across the reef the stems and leaves of plaintaintrees with which the island seemed to abound and this he believed they might be prevailed upon to furnish as they had it now in their power to make their wants fully explained by means of Omai and his countrymen Capt Cook though he had but little hopes that the natives friendly as they appeared to be would yet be so ungenerous as to destroy the young stock that supplied them with food to accommodate them immediately consented to make trial of their bounty  Accordingly about ten in the morning of the d Mr Gore with two of the Resolution's boats and one from the Discovery were sent as far as the reef with orders to wait there till the return of the gentlemen who were to make the experiment among whom was Mr Gore Mr Anderson and  Omai from the Resolution and Mr Burney from the Discovery As soon as they were seen making for the shore they were met by several of the natives with cocoanuts and being told by Omai that they wished to land two canoes came from the shore in one of which Mr Burney and Mr Anderson entered unarmed and were landed safely on the reef over which they were conducted by two of the natives one supporting the arm of Mr Burney and the other the arm of Mr Anderson till they had both crossed the rugged stones and had reached the beach They were then conducted by their friendly guides through a crowd who having just gratified their curiosity by viewing the dog diverted their attention to admire the men and pressed upon them so closely as prevented their proceeding till some of them who seemed to be persons in authority dealt their blows pretty severely about them to beat them off The two gentlemen were then led up an avenue of cocoapalms till they came to a number of men drawn up in ranks with their clubs shouldered through which they were marched till they came to a chief sitting on the ground fanning himself without any other ornament to distinguish him than a large bunch of beautiful red feathers in his ears projecting forwards This chief they were desired to salute as he sat according to the custom of the country From him they were led to another a person for a young man of unusual corpulence and having repeated their salutations as before they were then led to a third chief who after being saluted desired them to sit down which they were very ready to do being sufficiently fatigued in going through the ceremonyAlmost instantly the crowd were separated and at the distance of about thirty  yards twenty fine girls neatly dressed and ornamented with red feathers came forward dancing to their own song which they continued without the least embarrassment till their dance was ended Thus agreeably entertained both the officer and the philosopher forgot for a moment that they were without their associates and in want of their interpreter when hastily rising to look about for them they at length found them coming up in form to the three chiefs whose names were Otteroo Taroa and Fatoweera and being all now met they took the opportunity to make known their commission for great pains had been taken to keep them apart for when the third chief was told by Mr Anderson that he would be glad to speak with Omai the chief peremptorily refused his request In the mean time they found the natives began to make free with their pockets which the chief instead of repressing seemed to encourage They now began to apprehend a concerted design of detaining them and to blame their own indiscretion in putting themselves so wholly in their power for in their situation they were as effectually cut off from the ships as if half the ocean had lain between them This they intimated to each other and Omai who was valiant only when no danger was near caught the panic and seeing a hole dug for an oven could hardly be persuaded but that it was to roast and eat him However to put their suspicions to the proof Mr Anderson and Mr Burney attempted to reach the beach but were stopt about half way and told they must return to the place they had left In this manner they were kept in suspence the greatest part of the day sometimes gazing at them sometimes talking to Omai and sometimes pushing back their clothes to admire  their skin and when the chiefs were pressed on the business they were sent upon they were told they must stay and eat with them before their request could be granted While Omai was entertaining the chiefs with the story of his travels Mr Anderson and Mr Burney made a second attempt and Mr Anderson had actually reached the beach and was beginning to wade in upon the reef when he was rudely pulled back and told he must return  Finding all their efforts in vain to release themselves they made a virtue of necessity and did as they were bid But the islanders observing something like fear in them brought some green boughs and sticking them in the ground desired them to hold them in their hands as they sat probably to preserve them from being incommoded by the crowd And soon after the second chief having first formed a ring ordered dinner First a pretty considerable number of cocoanuts were brought and shortly after a long green basket with a quantity of baked plantains sufficient to have served half the ship's company and lastly part of a young hog nicely dressed and Omai was treated with kava the drink he had been used to in his own country As soon as dinner was over they were told they might depart and being conducted to the beach they found canoes ready to carry them to their boats in which were a few plantaintrees already embarked but not enough to serve the cattle a single week  Though the people seemed not illdisposed it was not in fact in their power without distressing themselves to afford any effectual supply and indeed they were so vain of their hospitality to strangers that as Omai said they dignified their island with the name of  Wenooa no te Eatooa    the Land of Gods Lat long E  On the th in the morning the ships made sail and with an easy breeze came up with the small island already mentioned which tho' surrounded with a reef like that we had just left yet there being no inhabitants to oppose them our boats made good their landing and brought off about cocoanuts for each ship some grass for the cattle and as much as they could load of leaves and branches of the young cocoatrees and of the tree called Wharra which being cut small was eaten by the cattle with great greediness The boats no sooner returned and were hoisted on board than we set sail to the Northward  And on the th in the morning the man at the masthead called out Land which was soon answered by the Resolution About three in the afternoon we fell in with Hervey's Isle seen by Capt Cook in his first voyage in lat long E The boats were instantly got out to search for soundings but found none stood off and on all night  Next morning the th several canoes came off brandishing their spears and threatening us apparently in a hostile manner The boats however were again sent in search of anchorage and in passing the canoes an officer sitting carelessly in one of the boats was near being pulled overboard by a native who made a spring to snatch something he had in his hand but missing his aim plunged instantly into the sea They then became very troublesome till a great gun was fired from our ship which in a moment dispersed them In the evening the boats returned with no better success than before In the mean time Capt Cook having displayed a white flag  in token of peace they did the same and then came on board friendly But though water was here equally unattainable as in the other islands of this group the night was spent in standing on and off  On the th in the morning we set sail and on the th came in sight of another island lat long  On the th tacked and stood in for land For the last hours the storms of thunder lightning and rain were almost incessant insomuch that it was found necessary to cover the scuttles of the magazine to secure the powder The people in both ships were now employed in catching water which though none of the best because of its tarry taste was yet richly prized and he who could save but a gallon aday when the rains began thought his labour amply rewarded but this proving the rainy season we in a few days filled all our empty casks and every man had liberty to use what he pleased Before these heavy rains fell and furnished them with a supply the people on board the Resolution had been greatly distressed for water as we have already remarked but now it was determined to direct our course to Anomocoa or Rotterdam Island and accordingly that island was appointed a place of rendezvous in case of separation The weather continued variable and though plenty of rain fell almost every day yet it was found adviseable to make use of the machine on board the Resolution and to use water obtained by distillation for every purpose for which it was fit It was apt to discolour the meat that was boiled with it and to tincture every thing with a disagreeable blackness but it was rather preferred to rain water because of the tarry taste communicated by the latter  Course in the evening S W lat long Nothing remarkable till  The th when we came in sight of land bearing W S W distance about eight or nine leagues It appeared like four islands We made sail and stood for the land but a heavy tempest coming on involved us in darkness In the evening we hove to and so continued during the night  In the morning of the th the boats were ordered out and about noon returned having found good anchorage in and fathom water fine sandy bottom near the shore The boats came back laden with the fruits of the island which they made free with having seen no inhabitants We no sooner cast anchor than parties from both ships were sent out to reconnoitre  The islet where we landed was little more than a mile in circumference and not more than feet above the surface of the sea notwithstanding which it is so covered with trees and bushes and among them sometimes cocoapalms  Menofwar birds tropic birds and two sorts of boobies were here found so tame that being on their nests they suffered the people to take them off with their hands Of each sort great numbers were killed which however would hardly have been thought eatable in better circumstances They likewise met with crabs creeping on the trees  At one part of the reef which bounds the lake within there was a large bed of coral almost even with the surface which afforded perhaps one of the most enchanting prospects that Nature has any where produced Its base was fixed to the shore but so deep that it could not be seen so that the upper surface seemed to be suspended  in the water which deepened so suddenly that at the distance of a few yards there might be seven or eight fathoms The sea was at this time quite unruffled and the sun shining bright exposed the various sorts of coral in the most beautiful order some parts branching into the water with great luxuriance others lying collected in round balls and in various other figures all which were greatly heightened by spangles of the richest colours that glowed from a number of large clams every where interspersed But the appearance of these was still inferior to that of the multitude of fishes that glided gently along seemingly with the most perfect security The colours of the different sorts were the most beautiful that can be imagined yellow blue red black c far exceeding any thing that art can produce Their various forms also contributed not a little to increase the richness of this submarine grotto which could not be surveyed without a pleasing transport mixed however with regret that a work so superlatively elegant should be concealed in a place where mankind could seldom have an opportunity of rendering the praises so justly due to so enchanting a scene  Here and in the adjoining islets the ships continued till the th during which they did not spend their time unprofitably for having taken on board a plentiful supply of food for the cattle which otherwise must have perished they had also procured more than cocoanuts which were equally divided between the crews  It must doubtless surprise the greatest part of our readers and perhaps stagger their belief when they are told of so many islands abounding with inhabitants who subsist with little or no fresh water Yet true it is that few or none of the little  low islands between the tropics have any water on the surface of the ground except perhaps in a lagoon the water of which is generally brackish nor is it easy to find water by digging The fact is the fruits of the earth are the chief food of the inhabitants and the milk of the cocoanut serves them for drink They want no water to boil any part of their food for they knew not the art of boiling till the Europeans taught them nor had they a vessel fitted for the purpose neither have they any occasion for washing their clothes because the materials of which they are made being of the paper kind will not bear washing Salt water therefore answers their purpose with very little fresh and adds a relish to their meat which when it is dressed they dip into seawater every mouthful that they eat This in a great measure accounts for their subsisting without fresh water tho' in the climate of England it would not be easy to subsist without it a single week And now having supplied the ships with the produce of this island and not being able to find anchorage near any of those adjoining we prepared to depart  On the th orders were given to sail but in the evening when the gentlemen returned three muskets three cartouch boxes and three hangers were missing These were the arms of three marines who had accompanied the gentlemen in an excursion up the country and who had committed their arms to the care of their comrades these on their return had forgotten them They were however recovered by sending the marines on shore who soon found them and brought them off On the return of the boat we instantly put to sea steering N W The islands  we had just left were the Palmerston Isles in lat and long E  On the th we varied our course steering W N W all night  On the d clear weather but a great swell from the South a sure presage of an approaching storm This day we altered our course to S S W with the wind variable  On the th the expected storm came on which increased to such an alarming height beforenight attended with thunder lightning and rain with a tremendous sea that with all our sails handed and our topgallant yards struck we were obliged to lie to under bare poles till morning appeared  On the th the storm being somewhat abated the Resolution of which we had lost sight bore down to us and at five in the afternoon we made sail under close reefed topsails About eleven at night we narrowly escaped running on shore on Savage Island the man at the masthead calling out Land when dark as it was we soon got sight of it close on our leebow steering directly for it We instantly put about and fired a gun as a signal for the Resolution then to windward about half a mile to do the same So narrow an escape made a strong impression on the ship's company who thoughtless as they are could not help looking up to heaven with thankful hearts for so signal a deliverance As soon as it was light next morning we saw this execrated island at the distance of about four leagues Lat obs long  On the th heavy thunder and rain Course S ½ W lat long  On the th our carpenter's mate had the misfortune to fall down upon deck and break his  leg Happy that no other misfortune had befallen us during a series of tempestuous weather which few ships would have been able to resist About nine in the morning the storm still continuing but the sky in part clear the man at the masthead called out Land which was presently known to be Anomocoa or Rotterdam Island so called by the Dutch who first discovered it bearing S W distance about four or five leagues At ten saw two mountains bearing S S W distance about nine or ten leagues and soon after a great smoak was seen to ascend from the lowermost The weather still continuing squally we approached Anomocoa with great caution About five in the afternoon the signal was made from the Resolution to come to which we obeyed and about six cast anchor  On the th we weighed again and in the evening worked into Anomocoa road About six we moored and was soon after joined by the Resolution We had now been just sixty days in a passage which in a direct course could not have exceeded ten and had been exposed to the severest trials owing to some fatality in pursuing a course which there was not a seaman on board that did not disapprove It seemed to have no object of discovery in view as we fell nearly into the same track which our Commodore had formerly navigated nor did we meet with a single island which one or other of our late Voyagers had not seen or visited in their different courses How it happened is not easy to be accounted for as it was next to a miracle that any creature on board the Resolution remained alive to reach our present harbour Had not the copious rains that fell almost incessantly from the time we passed the Tropic till our arrival here supplied the daily  consumption of water on board our ships not only the animals but the men must have perished Happy however that we now found ourselves in safety on a friendly coast We forgot the dangers we had escaped and thought only of enjoying with double pleasure the sweets of these happy islands whose spontaneous productions perfume the air to a considerable distance with a fragrance inconceivably reviving and whose plantations exhibit a richness of prospect as we approached them owing to the beautiful intermixture of the various blossoms with the vivid green leaves of the trees of which the most animated description can communicate but a faint idea Add to these the tufted clumps that naturally adorn the little rising hills that appear every where delightfully interspersed among verdant lawns and rich meadows bordered by rivulets of water which among the islands in the tropical climates are as rare as they are refreshing and nothing in nature can be more pleasing to the eye or more grateful to the senses  May We were no sooner moored in the harbour than we were surrounded with innumerable little boats or canoes most curiously constructed and ornamented the sides with a polish that surpassed the blackest ebony and the decks inlaid with mother of pearl and tortoiseshell equal to the best cabinets of European manufacture In this kind of workmanship those islanders seem to excel Their weapons of war their clubs the handles of their working tools the paddles of their boats and even their fishhooks are polished and inlaid with variegated shells with an infinite accumulation of which their shores are margined and among them our Naturalists found some of superlative beauty These boats  held generally three persons and under their decks which take up twothirds of their length they brought the fruits of their plantations and the maunufactures of their country these last consisting besides cloth of different fabrics of a great variety of things useful and others ornamental Of the first sort were combs fishhooks lines nets made after the European fashion needles made of bone with thread of different fineness purses calibashes made of reeds so closely wrought as to be watertight with a variety of other utensils Among the latter were bracelets breastplates ornamented with feathers of a vivid glow masks mantelets composed of feathers so artfully and beautifully arranged as even our English ladies would not have disdained to wear These were of immense value in the Society Isles where Omai said a fine red feather would purchase a hog and of these and red feathers Omai laid in a store  The people of these islands have already been so well described by Capt Cook and Mr Forster that what we have now to add is rather to confirm their accounts than to advance any thing new We found them of a friendly disposition generous hospitable and ready to oblige Some there were among them most villainously given to thieving but that propensity did not appear to them so much a vice in the light we are apt to consider it as a craft synonymous to  cunning  according to our acceptation of the word He who was detected and punished was neither pitied nor despised by his neighbours Even the Arees or great men among them thought it no crime to practise that craft upon our Commanders whenever they found an opportunity and would only laugh when they were detected just as a cunning fellow in England would laugh when he had found an  opportunity of outwitting an honester man than himself  As soon as the usual ceremonies had passed and peace was established the Commanders of both ships gave orders that no person of whatever rank on board should purchase any thing of the natives till the ships were supplied with provisions This order was issued for two purposes one to regulate the prices the other to oblige the natives to bring their provisions to market when they found that nothing else was saleable and it produced the desired effect The number of hogs and fruit that were brought were greater than the daily consumption though the ordinary shipallowance was entirely stopt and the produce of the islands served out in its stead We even salted for several days from four to six hogs aday  The civility of the Chiefs was not confined to their readiness to supply the ships with provisions They complimented the Commanding Officers with the use of a magnificent house a large boathouse conveniently situated upon the beach during their stay and at the same time presented them with breastplates most beautifully decorated with feathers being the richest presents they had to make In return the Commanders were not wanting in generosity loading them with hatchets knives linen cloth glass and beads with which they thought themselves amply repaid  May The tents were this day carried on shore the Astronomer's observatory erected wooders and waterers appointed and all the artificers on board employed in the reparations of the ships not a few being wanting after a voyage of two months through a tempestuous sea  during which the elements of fire air and water might be said to have been in perpetual conflict  While these things were about the Commanders and Chiefs were every day contriving to vary the pleasures of their respective guests and to entertain them with new diversions They were mutually engaged on board and on shore to surprise each other with novelty On board the Chiefs were entertained with music dancing and feasting after the  manner and with what seemed much more  to them as they paid more attention to it with the various operations of the artificers who were at work on their respective employments The facility with which the boatbuilders performed their work particularly attracted their notice when they beheld the labour of a year with them performed in a week by the same number of hands on board their astonishment was beyond conception nor were they less in amazement to see large timber cut through the middle and sawed into planks while they were spectators which they had no means of effecting in their island in many days On shore the Chiefs in return endeavoured to entertain the Commanders they feasted them like tropical kings with barbicued hogs fowls and with the most delicious fruits and for wine they offered them a liquor made before their faces in a manner not to be mentioned without disgust but as the Chiefs had refused to drink wine on board our Commanders and those who attended them needed no other apology for refusing to partake of this liquor with them They likewise after dinner introduced their music and dancers who were chiefly women of the theatrical cast and excelled in agility and varied attitudes many of the best performers in Europe a kind of pantomime  succeeded in which some prizefighters displayed their feats of arms and this part of the drama concluded with a humourous representation of some laughable story which produced among the Chief and their attendants the most immoderate mirth The songsters came last the melody of whose voices was heightened by a kind of accompanyment not unusual in the earliest ages among the politest nations as may be learnt from ancient paintings where the singers and dancers are represented with flat clams or shells in their hands clapping them together quickly or slowly to regulate their movements and harmonize their tunes  Though this farcical exhibition was otherwise insipid to us it was not wholly without its use in marking a similarity of manners among mankind at the distance of half the globe and at a period when the arts of civil life were in their infancy Who knows but that the seeds of the liberal arts that have now been sown by European navigators in these happy climes may a thousand years hence be ripened into maturity and that the people who are how emerging from ignorance into science may when the memory of these Voyages are forgotten be found in the zenith of their improvements by other Adventurers who may pride themselves as the first discoverers of new countries and an unknown people infinitely superior to those who at that time may inhabit these regions and who may have lost their boasted arts as we at this day see among the wretched inhabitants of Greece and the still more miserable slaves of Egyptian bondage Such are the vicissitudes to which the inhabitants of this little orb are subject and such perhaps are the vicissitudes which the globe itself must undergo before its final dissolution To a contemplative mind  these islands present a mortifying spectacle of the ruins of a broken and desolated portion of the earth for it is impossible to survey so many fragments of rocks some with inhabitants and some without and not conclude with the learned and ingenious Dr Burnet that they are the effects of some early convulsion of the earth of which no history gives any account But to return  During our stay here we were nightly entertained with the fiery eruptions of the neighbouring volcanos of which notice has been taken by former Voyagers There are two mountains that occasionally emit fire and smoke but that called Kollifeau is the most constant  May Being the th day of our residence at Anomocoa our wooders returned almost blinded by the rains that fell from the manchionellotrees faitanootrees says Capt Cook a species of pepper which yields a corrosive sap of a milky colour and with blotches all over those parts of their bodies to which the rains happened to have access The poisonous quality of these trees has been noticed by other Voyagers but was more severely felt upon this occasion than by any of our people in the like situation in the former Voyages Many capital thefts were committed during our stay and some articles of considerable value were carried off  This day Capt Clerke's steelyards were stolen out of his cabin while he with other gentlemen were entertained by the Chiefs with a Heiva or dramatic farce on shore but was afterwards recovered On the same day as he was mingled with the crowd his scissars was taken out of his pocket three different times and as often replaced when missed  On the th we unmoored and shifted our station but in so doing we parted our small bower anchor with about fathom of cable the anchor remaining among the rocks In the evening we moored again From this day till  The th we were employed in recovering the anchor we had lost which after losing the buoyrope and grappling was brought on board and secured One of the natives stole an axe from the ship but was discovered and fired at He escaped by diving A party of them had unlashed the stream anchor and was lowering it down into the canoe but being discovered in the act paddled to shore and got clear off  On the th the live stock which had been landed the day after our arrival on a small island about half a mile from the shore to graze were brought on board amazingly recovered from perfect skeletons the horses and cows were grown plump and as playful as young colts This day orders were issued for sailing the tents were struck and Mr Phillipson Lieutenant of Marines lost all his bedding by the carelessness of the centinel who received lashes for neglect of duty In the morning the longboat was found swamped and all the stern sheets and several other articles belonging to her missing and never recovered for which the marine who had the care of the watch was severely punished  On the th we made sail W by S by the advice and direction of a Chief named Tiooney Feenou so called by Capt Cook and said to be king of the Friendly Isles to an island Appee about leagues distant which abounded he said in every thing we wanted wood water hogs fowls fruits and grass for our cattle We sailed with a fine breeze wind N E course W  S W and about eleven at night passed the burning mountains bearing N N W distant about half a mile The flames rising from the lowermost with a bellowing noise louder than thunder but hoarser and more terrifying illuminated the air in the night and enabled us to work through the most dangerous passage that could possibly be navigated We had more than islands within sight all of them surrounded with reefs of rocks with so many windings and turnings as truly might be said to constitute a labyrinth but by the assistance of our India pilot we passed them all in safety and  On the th moored in a fine bay on the west side of Appee Island in fathom water shelly bottom We had scarce moored before we were surrounded with natives from all quarters who had been apprized of our coming and who had loaded their canoes with hogs fowls breadfruit yams plantains and every kind of fruit the island produced which they exchanged for broken glass red and blue beads shreds of scarlet cloth or indeed any thing we offered them  On the th the live stock were landed and a proper guard appointed to look after them  Here our friend Tiooney whom we shall now call Feenou assumed the same consequence as a Ammocoa He came on board with his canoe laden with four large hogs breadfruit and chaddocks a fine odoriferous fruir in smell and taste not unlike a lemon but larger and more round He brought likewise yams of an enormous size weighing from fifty to sixty pounds each  He was followed by the Araké and Chiefs of the island who came laden in the same manner with hogs fowls and every species of provisions  the island afforded these he introduced in form to the Commanders and Officers according to their rank This ceremony over the tents were landed and all hands set to work to finish the repairs of the ships The Chiefs were feasted on board and the Commanders and Officers hospitably entertained on shore On our part fireworks were exhibited the marines were drawn up and went through their military manoeuvres surrounded by thousands of natives who were frightened at first and fled but finding they did no harm took courage and rallied at a distance but no persuasions could prevail upon them to come near On the part of the natives they were equally inclined to please they gave Heivas every day and drew their warriors together who went likewise through their military exercises and beat one another severely in their mock fights which in that respect differed but little from our wrestlers boxers and cudgelplayers in England In this manner and in ranging the island botanizing examining the curiosities natural and artificial the Commanders Gentlemen and Officers employed their time while the live stock were gathering strength and recruiting their flesh and the several artificers were compleating the repairs of the ships It is not easy for people who are totally unacquainted with the language of a country to make themselves masters of the civil policy of the inhabitants Indeed it is next to impossible in a short residence among them As we observed no such medium as money by which the value of property is ascertained it was not easy to discover what else they had substituted in its room to facilitate the modes of traffic among themselves That each had a property in the plantation he possessed we could plainly discern  and the Araké and Chiefs among them were ready enough to point out their possessions the extent of which gave them consequence as among other civilized nations but no such thing as circulating property being discoverable by the hoarding up of which and laying it out occasionally to advantage one might purchase another's landed or substantial property We could not inform ourselves sufficiently by what means the fisherman purchased his canoe or the boatbuilder his materials yet there cannot remain a doubt but that the boatbuilder had an interest in his boat after it was built as well as the chief in his plantation after it was inclosed and cultivated With us all was carried on by barter and an imaginary value fixed on every article A hog was rated at a hatchet and so many breadfruit cocoanuts and plantains at a string of beads and so in like manner throughout but among themselves we saw no such value by way of barter We did not observe so much fruit given for so many fish nor so many combs needles or useful materials for a certain proportion of cloth but doubtless some mode of exchange there must be among them for it is certain there was no such thing as money at least none that we could discern neither could we discover any modes of gaming among them which was the more remarkable as their great men seemed to have nothing to do except transporting themselves from one place to another or taking the diversion of fishing Neither could we observe any laws by which their civil policy was regulated notwithstanding which we saw no disorders among them but every thing conducted with the greatest decorumSalt which is so necessary  an article in European housekeeping was wholly unknown to the tropical islanders  On the th an Araké came on board and presented Capt Clerke with a large and elegant headdress ornamented with pearls shells and red feathers wreathed with flowers of the most resplendent colours The Captain in return loaded him with many useful articles of European manufacture knives scissars saws and some showy strings of beads which were highly prized by this chief who thought it no disgrace to paddle himself on shore with his rich acquisitions  On the th an affair happened on board the Discovery that had nearly cancelled all former obligations and put an end to that friendship which mutual acts of civility and generosity had apparently contributed to cement One of the chiefs who had been frequently on board and who had been of the parties cordially entertained invited perhaps by the familiarity of a young cat and delighted by its playfulness watched his oppportunity to carry it off but unluckily for him was detected before he could effect his purpose He was immediately seized and clapt in irons and an express sent on shore to acquaint the Araké or king with the greatness of his crime and the nature of his punishment On this news the Araké himself and several of his chiefs hastened on board when to their grief and astonishment they found the prisoner to be the king's brother This news soon circulated and the whole island was in commotion Feenou seasonably interposed He applied to Omai to know what was to be done and upon what terms his release might be procured Omai told him his offence was of such a nature as not to be remitted without punishment he must  submit to be tied up and receive lashes that the higher he was in rank the more necessary it was to punish him by way of example to deter others from practices of the like nature and that therefore it was in vain to plead for his deliverance upon any other terms than submission Feenou acquainted the Araké with all that had passed and presently a number of chiefs entered into consultation upon the measures that were to be pursued some by their gestures were for resenting the insult and others were for submitting Some in great wrath were for instantly returning to shore and assembling the warriors in order to make reprizals and no less than seven attempted to leave the ship but found the way stopt to prevent their escape Two or three jumped overboard but were instantly followed taken up and brought back Thus finding themselves beset on all sides and the king himself as well as the chiefs in the power of our commanders they again entered into consultation and after half an hour's deliberation the result was to make a formal surrender of the prisoner to the Araké of the ship to beseech him to mitigate the rigour of his punishment and at the same time to put him in mind of the regard that had been shewn to him and his people not only by the chiefs of the island in general but more particularly by the friends and relations of the offender who had it still in their power to render them farther service This was what was chiefly intended by the whole process The prisoner was no sooner surrendered in form than he was tied to the shrouds and received one lash and dismissed The joy of the multitude who were assembled on the shore waiting with anxious suspense to learn what was to  become of their unfortunate chief is hardly to be conceived when they saw him at large they received him on his landing with open arms and instead of resenting the indignity that had been offered to the second person of the state was ready to load his persecutors with gifts and to prostrate themselves in gratitude Nothing can be more characteristic of the pacific disposition of these Friendly Islanders than their behaviour on this occasion They seem to be the only people upon earth who in principle and practice are true Christians They may be truly said to love their enemies though they never heard the precepts that enjoins it  Early on the st the king came on board with four large hogs and as much breadfruit yams and shaddocks as his boat would hold as a present to the Captain for which he would take no return but a hatchet and some beads were put into his boat with which he returned much gratified  On the d th Cook their warriors were all drawn up in battle array and performed a mockfight but lest any stratagem should be intended the marines were ordered to attend the engagement nothing however that indicated treachery appeared The battle was followed by a heiva which was acknowledged by Capt Cook and all on board both ships to be performed with a dexterity and exactness that far surpassed the specimen we had given of our military manoeuvres  On the d orders were given to prepare for sailing The live stock that had been grazing possibly on the lands of him who received the lash were got on board wood and water were brought in plenty the former of the best quality  and the latter excellent In short nothing could exceed the accommodations of every kind with which we were furnished in this delightful island  On the th we unmoored and  On the th made sail in company with the Resolution but in the night heavy squalls with thunder lightning and rain to which these islands are much exposed Many of the natives accompanied us as passengers to Anamocoa  On the th we were employed beating to windward and about twelve at night the Resolution fired a gun as a signal of distress She had run aground on a reef but before we could come to her assistance she rolled off  On the st of June we came in fight of the burning mountains distance about four leagues And about eleven in the forenoon moored in a fine bay Here the natives came to us with hogs in abundance some of which were killed and cured but the pork soon contracted a disagreeable taint which was much complained of by the ships companies While eaten fresh the meat was of an exquisite flavour  Nothing remarkable till the th when we made sail and about five in the afternoon the Resolution reached Anamocoa and moored in her old birth Lat long but the Discovery not being able to beat up against the storm did not arrive till seven in the evening when casting anchor she drove and in less than an hour was three leagues to leeward of the Resolution and in the utmost danger of being wrecked All hands were now employed in weighing up the anchor and a number of hands came seasonably from the Resolution to our assistance The night was tempestuous with a heavy rain and high sea  Our labour till four in the morning was incessant We made but little way to the windward notwithstanding the utmost exertion of our whole strength Providentially the gale subsided we swayed the anchor and before daylight was safely moored by the side of the Resolution Here though the sea was rough and we were at a great distance from shore the natives continued to trade and supply us with plenty of fresh provisions with which they kept market daily  On the th Feenou came on board and gave an account of the loss of several of his people in attempting to accompany us in their canoes from Appee that he himself was in the utmost danger that being overset in his canoe he was obliged to swim more than two leagues and that at last he was miraculously discovered and taken up by a fishing canoe on the coast of Appee when he was almost spent We expressed great joy at his deliverance and he no less to find the ships safe in their former station as he thought it almost impossible that they could weather the storm Being amply provided with every necessary this island could afford  On the th we set sail for Tongataboo or Amsterdam Island but in our passage both the Resolution and Discovery fell foul of the same rock the Resolution only touched upon it slightly but the Discovery stuck fast and hung upon it gunnel too happy it was that we had daylight and fine weather and that the Resolution was within call By clapping the sails to the mast and lightening the ship abaft we swayed her off with little damage We were then within two leagues of Amsterdam off which in the evening we cast anchor in six fathom water We were instantly surrounded with natives who came  to welcome us and seemed overjoyed at our arrival It is not uncommon for voyagers to stigmatize these islanders with the name of SAVAGES than which no appellation can be worse applied for a more civilized people does not exist under the sun During our long stay with them we did not see one instance of disorder among themselves nor one persen punished for any misdemeanor by their own chiefs we saw but few quarrels among individuals On the contrary much mirth and seeming harmony was observable Highly delighted with their shows and heivas they spend their time in a kind of luxurious indolence where all but the Chiefs labour a little but none to excess The Araké indeed paddles himself in his canoe though he must have a towtow or servant to help him to eat This seems strange to an European as it reduces the man to the condition of a child and yet it is but one remove from what we see daily practised before our eyes The gentleman has his table spread his food of various sorts set before him has all his apparatus made ready his bread cut his meat carved and his plate furnished he has his drink handed to him and in short every thing which the tropical king has except only conveying all those matters to his mouth which tho' not the practice at the courts of European princes the Araké thinks necessary to be done by his towtow Yet the addition of this single act of handing his meat and drink to his mouth brings a term of reproach upon the Araké though by the handiness of his servants in the services of the table the European gains the character of the polite gentleman Such and so slender are the distinctions in the refinements of nations the barriers that divide simplicity from sumptuousness and the  plainness of the Araké from the magnificence of the prince  On the th we weighed and sailed in company with the Resolution and moored again in Maria's Bay one of the finest harbours in the South Seas Here we were surrounded by more than canoes at once all laden with provisions or the manufactures of the country Feenou who seemed to be the Emperor of the islands and who all along affected to be thought the real Sovereign still accompanied us And about six leagues from this harbour had his chief residence Plenty of hogs and fowls without number were brought us and were purchased at so cheap a rate as a hog for a hatchet and a fowl for a nail or a string of blue beads Our live stock were put ashore upon a most delightful lawn where they ranged at pleasure and where their pastures were bounded by refreshing shades On the little island on which they were placed to graze a plash of water was found which by digging was enlarged to a pond that not only supplied drink for the cattle but water in plenty for the use of the ships In this harbour too were found every necessary for repairing the damages the ships had received in striking against the rock and here too every attention was paid us that our Commander in Chief had experienced in his former visits of which the inhabitants had not yet lost the remembrance  On the th the chiefs were assembled and Capt Cook made his most valuable presents To the king he gave a young English bull and cow to Feenou a horse and mare and to the king's fatherinlaw a Cape ram and two ewes  But on the th an accident happened that put the whole island in commotion While our  people were engaged in preparing fireworks to entertain the chiefs two turkies a shegoat and a peacock were stolen from the Discovery and craftily carried off They were no sooner missed than complaint was made to Feenou of this breach of hospitality and a peremptory demand made to have them restored Whether he was privy to the theft and was willing to connive at it or what was more probable knew not by whom it was committed nor how readily to recover creatures of so much curiosity which no doubt would be artfully concealed he seemed to make light of it and to offer hogs and fowls in return but this offer was rejected and Capt Cook being applied to ordered the canoes about the ships to be seized two chiefs that were in the ship to be detained and an order issued for burning all their boats if what was taken away were not in four and twenty hours restored This order being known abroad the inhabitants assembled from all quarters and in less than half a day more than of their fighting men appeared in arms upon the beach in the mean time our two Captains had ordered their pinnaces out their boats to be manned and armed parties of marines to be put on board and every preparation to be made as if to carry their threats into execution Upon their first landing a native issued from the woods out of breath as if just come from a long journey and acquainted the Captains that he had seen the strange creatures that had been taken away at the house of a chief on the opposite side of the island whither he was ready to conduct them if they chose to follow him  Our Captain thinking this a proper opportunity to survey the island accepted the offer and accordingly set out in company with Mr Blythe  Master of the Resolution Mr Williamson Third Lieutenant with several other gentlemen attended with a party of marines directing their course as the Indian led the way  They had hardly been gone an hour before strong parties of natives poured down from the hills to strengthen those that were already assembled upon the beach The Captain of marines who had charge of the boats having drawn up his men on seeing the numbers of the enemy begin to appear formidable ordered them to fire over their heads This they disregarded and were beginning their warsong which always precedes their coming to action when Capt Cook gave Feenou to understand that he would instantly destroy them if they did not that moment disperse Feenou terrified by the countenance with which this threat was accompanied rushed among the foremost ranks of the warriors seized the spears of the chiefs broke several of them and returning laid them at the Captain's feet This had in part the desired effect the islanders retreated in a body but seemingly unwilling to disperse  The Captain of marines disliking the appearance of the enemy made signs from the shore for the ships to bring their broadsides to bear and at the same time drew up his men under their guns The Commanding Officer on board the Discovery improved the hint and instantly fired some round shot directly over the heads of the thickest of the enemy This compleated what Feenou had begun a panic seized the chiefs and the rest sled like so many sheep without a pursuer Capt Clerke ignorant of what had happened but not out of hearing of the great guns was at a loss to determine whether to go on or to  return but the great guns ceasing after the first discharge he rightly concluded that whatever might be the original cause of their firing it did not require a second discharge to remove it he therefore resolved to proceed In his progress the heat became almost intolerable which was rendered still more insupportable by the want of water there being none to be met with except what was brackish  After a journey of more than miles through a country intersected with numerous plantations and where there was hardly any beaten path he at length arrived at the residence of the Chief whom they found feasting on a barbicued pig a stewed yam and some breadfruit of which he had plenty Surprized at the sight of the Captain and his attendants and conscious of their errand he went out immediately and produced the turkey goat and peacock which he readily returned but made no apology for the theft nor for the trouble he had given the Araké of the ships in coming so far to recover the loss  On their return to the tents they found Feenou still there who welcomed them with much seeming sincerity and began with apologizing for the conduct of his people owing he said to the misapprehension of the orders from the ships which were as they thought to burn and destroy all without exception men women and children and to lay waste the island He then invited Capt Cook to accompany him a little way into an adjoining wood with which invitation he very readily complied and found two cocoanuttrees with the branches stript of their leaves and fruits hung with yams breadfruit and shaddocks ranged in spirals curiously intersected and terminated each with two hogs one ready barbicued  and one alive which he had ordered to be prepared as presents to the two Commanders for which he would receive no return The barbicued hog was an acceptable present to the people who had travelled four and twenty miles with no other refreshment than what they carried with them except some fruit which they gathered on the road A party of islanders were planted in readiness to dismantle the trees and the boats were employed to carry their contents on board the ships and thus ended this memorable day which probably will be commemorated in this island as a day of deliverance by the latest posterity  During our stay here our Commanders came to the knowledge of the  real  rank and characters of the chiefs who had been assiduous in loading them with favours Feenou who had affected to be thought the sovereign was here deprived of his royal dignity and Poulaho acknowledged to be lord over all there were besides a person of supreme authority whose name was Mareewagee and another named Toobou who were held in high estimation and to whom the people paid implicit obedience but superior to these last was Prince Fatafaihe King Paulaho's son Mareewagee and old Toobou were brothers Feenou was Mareewagee's son and King Poulaho was his soninlaw having married his daughter such were the relationship of this royal family who held no less than islands in obedience and all comprehended under the name of the Friendly Islands  Here more capital thefts were committed and more islanders punished than in all the Friendly Islands besides one was punished with lashes for only stealing a knife another with for endeavouring  to carry off two or three drinkingglasses three were punished with lashes each for heaving stones at the wooders but what was still more cruel a man for attempting to carry off an axe was ordered to have his arm cut to the bone which he bore without complaining Capt Cook observes that slogging seemed to make no greater impression upon them than it would have done upon the mainmast Captain Clerke hit upon a mode of treatment which had some effect He put them under the hands of the barber and compleatly shaved their heads This exposed them to the ridicule of their countrymen and pointed them out to the guards never to let them come near the ships or tents any more  It is not to be wondered that after such wanton acts of cruelty the inhabitants should grow outrageous and though they did not break out into open acts of hostility yet they watched every opportunity to be vexatious  On the d some of the officers from both ships who had made an excursion into the interior parts of the island and had taken with them their guns with the necessary ammunition and some other articles as presents had in the course of their expedition the ill fortune to be stript of every thing they had about them by the dexterity of the natives This had like to have been a knotty business The chiefs from what had happened before fearing they should again be put under confinement sled on the first notice of the outrage so that there was now no chief of any authority to apply to for redress  Capt Cook having had no knowledge of the excursion and Omai having been applied to by the sufferers to seek redress was not a little displeased at Omai's taking upon him to intermeddle in an  affair of so much consequence and very severely reprimanded him for his presumption This put Omai on his metal and being a great favourite with Feenou he applied to him to return and succeeded upon the most solemn assurance of safety as Capt Cook would not resent it the gentlemen having made the excursion without his leave When the chiefs returned they urged a very plausible argument for absenting themselves Had the gentlemen said they intimated to us their desire of seeing the country we would have appointed proper persons to have protected them and then we should have been answerable for any losses they might have sustained but as they acted entirely at their own risque they must blame themselves for the consequences Though Capt Cook gave himself no farther trouble about the matter most of the things were recovered one musket only excepted  On the th one of the natives who accompanied us on board watched his opportunity to steal a drinking vessel but being catched in the act was punished with lashes to the no small diversion of his countrymen We were now visited by the flux which however only weakened our men but carried none off  On the th Mr Williamson and Mr Blythe who were fond of shooting and consequently of ranging the woods and thickets were set upon by ten or twelve of the natives who took from them their fowlingpieces and shotbags the former of which they carried off but dropped the shotbags on being pursued  Recourse was had to the former expedient of seizing the canoes and threatening the island as before and one of the fowlingpieces was by  that means recovered but the other was never returned  On the th order were given to prepare for sailing the live stock were taken on board so altered that they could not have been known for the same poor skeletons which two months before had been landed on these fertile shores Capt Cook made Feenou a present of a horse and a mare a bull and a cow a ram and a ewe for the many services he had rendered him and his people during their residence in the Friendly Isles by which he gratified him beyond his utmost wishes These valuable presents were immediately driven to his palace at Tongataboo distant about four leagues  The ships being now compleatly stowed having wood and water as much as they could make room for with hogs and breadfruit cocoanuts yams and other roots greens in abundance and in short every thing that the ships could contain or the crews desire the boats were sent out to seek a passage to the Southeastward in order to visit the celebrated little island of Middleburgh of which former voyagers had deservedly given a most enchanting description  On the th the boats returned having discovered a narrow gut not half a cable's length in breadth and from ½ to fathom water loomy bottom  This day Mr Nelson of whom mention has already been made being alone on the hills and rocks collecting plants and herbs indigenous to the island and at a considerable distance from the ships was attacked by five or six Indians who first began by throwing stones at which they are very dexterous and then finding he had no firearms closed in with him stript him of his  clothes and his bag which were all that he had about him  On the st of July the boats were manned and the Captains of both ships went on shore to prefer their complaints to the Araké but the offenders upon enquiry being found to be boys and the clothes and bag of plants of small value Mr Nelson unwilling to embroil the inhabitants in any more disputes interceded with Capt Cook as we were just upon our departure not to make his loss an object of contention but to take leave of the Chiefs in the most friendly manner who upon the whole had behaved with uncommon kindness and generosity  On the d while we were getting things in readiness to depart we had an opportunity of discovering the reason of a very singular mark which was observed by former navigators a little above the temples of many of the Chiefs We perceived that this day was kept sacred throughout the whole island that nothing was suffered to be sold neither did the people touch any food and besides that several of our new acquaintance were missing Enquiring into the cause we were told that Feenou's mother was dead Poulaho's son according to Capt Cook and that the Chiefs who were her descendants stayed at home to have their temples burnt This custom is not confined to this island only but is likewise common to several others particularly to those of Eaoowee or Middleburgh and Appee This mark is made on the left side on the death of a mother and on the right when the father dies and on the death of the highpriest the first joint on the little finger is amputated Mr Anderson says this is done on occasions of sickness These people have an unconquerable dread of death and when they  think themselves in danger they hope that the Deity will accept of the little finger as a sort of sacrifice efficacious to procure the recovery of their health not more probable than our Journalists reason These people had therefore their superstitious rites though we were not able to discover how or when they were performed  Capt Cook gives a different reason too from our Journalist for the mark in the temples which is owing he says on all occasions of mourning to their custom of striking their faces with their fist but the most extraordinary practice among them is their beating their Chief to sleep with their hands When the Chief is inclined to rest two women one on each side ply their palms briskly to every part of his body and so continue to do all night and when he wakes in the morning they help to make his kava If he happens to wake before the sun rises they then redouble their beating till he goes to sleep again  On the th we unmoored worked out of the bay and lay in readiness to take the advantage of a wind to carry us through the gut in our way to Eaoowhe or Middleburgh  On the th there was an eclipse of the sun but the weather being unfavourable our astronomers were rather disappointed  On the th we cleared the gut Being now beyond the reefs we again cast anchor at about three leagues distance We had scarce let fall our anchors when there came along side a large canoe in which there were three men and a women of superior dignity to any we had yet seen one of them supposed by his venerable appearance to be the highpriest held a long pole or spear in his hand to which he tied a white flag and began an oration which lasted a considerable  time and after it was ended he ascended the side of the ship and sat down with great composure upon the quarterdeck till he was accosted by Capt Clerke who after the usual salutations invited him and those who accompanied him into the great cabin but his attendants declined the invitation and to make known the dignity of the great personage in whose presence they were they prostrated themselves before him the women as well as the men and touched the sole of his right foot first with the palm and then with the back of the hand the usual homage paid to all the Sovereigns of the Friendly Isles This aged native brought with him as a present to the Captain four large hogs six fowls and a proportionable quantity of yams and plantains In return the Captain gave him a printed gown a Chinese lookingglass some earthen cups and several other curiosities which he accepted with great courtesy and with an air of dignity which remarkably distinguished him  The Captain and officers paid him great attention and shewed him the different accommodations on board the ship at which he expressed great astonishment He was then invited to eat which he declined He was offered wine of which the Captain drank first he put it to his lips tasted it but returned the glass After being on board little more than an hour he was desirous of taking leave and pointed to a little island to which he gave the Captain a very pressing invitation to accompany him but that could not be complied with as the ships were every moment expected to sail This venerable person was about six feet three inches high finely proportioned and had a commanding air that was both affable and graceful  On the th Feenou came on board the Resolution to take his final leave he brought with him five hogs with a large proportion of yams and fruit He testified his grief at parting with all that appearance of sincerity that characterizes the people of these happy islands  On the th we weighed and on the th cast anchor on the S W side of the island of Eaoowhe or Middleburgh where the people came on board with as little ceremony as if they had been acquainted with us for many years Indeed Capt Cook was no stranger there for Taoofor their chief had been his  tayo  or bosom friend when he was at this island in his former voyage They brought us the produce of the island but being already supplied with every necessary of that kind our chief traffic was for birds and feathers Here the parrots and paroquets were of the most beautiful plumage far surpassing those usually imported into Europe from the Indies there were a great variety of other birds on which many gentlemen in both ships set a great value though they were purchased for trifles The feathers we purchased were of divers colours for the northern market but chiefly red from the Marquesas and Society Isles We also purchased cloth and many other articles of curious workmanship the artists of this island for invention and ingenuity in the execution exceeding those of all the other islands in the South Seas But what chiefly tended to prolong our stay here was the richness of the grass which made into hay proved excellent food for our live stock From the accounts circulated through the ship when we arrived it was generally believed that we might travel through this island with our pockets open provided they were not lined with iron but to this the behaviour  of a party of the inhabitants to William Collet Captain's Steward of the Discovery was an exception Being alone diverting himself in surveying the country he was set upon and stript of every thing he had about him his shoes only excepted and on preferring his complaint his keys were all that he was able to recover  Here Capt Cook while the cattle that were reserved were grazing made an excursion into the heart of the country where the hills rose to a great height from whence torrents of rain in the rainy season are poured down to the sea While he was absent one of the natives in the circle where our people traded struck one of their countrymen with a club which laid bare if not fractured his skull and then broke his thigh with the same weapon before our men could interpose He had no signs of life when carried off but afterwards revived a little His crime was being caught in the fact with a better man's wife than himself She it seems was only to have a slight beating  On the th th Cook orders were given to prepare for sailing and Otaheite was appointed our place of rendezvous in case of separation We had now been near three months improving our live stock wooding watering repairing our ships and laying in fresh provisions in these friendly islands when the above orders were issued out The crews of both ships received these orders with alacrity for though they wanted for nothing yet they longed to be at Otaheite where many of them had formed connections that were dear to them and where those who had not yet been there had conceived so high an idea of its superiority as to make them look upon every  other place they touched at as an uncultivated garden in comparison with that little Eden  Just before we set sail Omai was offered the Sovereignty of the place and would gladly have accepted of it had Capt Cook approved of it but he did not for what reason does not appear  We found the best articles for traffic at these islands iron tools in general axes and hatchets nails from the largest spike down to tenpenny ones razors files and knives are much sought after red cloth and linen both white and coloured lookingglasses and beads are also in estimation but of the latter those that are blue are preferred to all others and white ones are thought the least valuable A string of large blue beads would at any time purchase a hog  In return for these all refreshments may be had such as hogs fowls fish yams breadfruit plantains cocoa nuts sugarcane c c  It may be expected says Capt Cook that after spending between two or three months among them I should be enabled to clear up every difficulty and to give a satisfactory account of their customs opinions and institutions both civil and religious especially as we had a person on board who might be supposed qualified to act the part of an interpreter by understanding their language and ours but poor Omai was very deficient for unless the object or thing we wanted to enquire about was actually before us we found it difficult to gain any tolerable knowledge of it from information only without falling into a hundred mistakes and to such mistakes Omai was more liable than we were For having no curiosity to gratify he never gave himself the trouble to make remarks for himself and when he was desired to explain matters to us his ideas  appeared to be so limited and perhaps so different from ours that his accounts were often so confused as to perplex instead of instructing us Add to this that it was very rare that we found among the natives a person who united the ability and inclination to give us the information we wanted and we found that most of them hated to be troubled with what they probably thought idle questions Our situation at Tongataboo where we staid longest was likewise unfavourable It was in a part of the country where there were few inhabitants except fishers It was always holyday with our visitors as well as with those we visited so that we had but few opportunities of observing what was really the domestic way of living among the natives Under these disadvantages it is not surprising that we should not be able to bring away any satisfactory accounts of many things but some of us endeavoured to remedy these disadvantages by diligent observation Those most worthy of notice respected the pains taken to obtain an adequate knowledge of their religious notions the rigid severity with which their mourning and other ceremonies are performed would induce a belief that they meant thereby to secure to themselves a felicity beyond the grave but of this they seem to have no conception all their views are temporal and all their prayers directed to avert the evils of this life The supreme Author of most things they call Kallafoetonga who they say is a female residing in the sky and directing the thunder wind rain and in general all the phaenomena of nature They believe that when she is angry the productions of the earth are blasted that they themselves are afflicted with diseases and death and that nothing prospers that they undertake  They have great faith in their endeavours to appease this Deity and for that purpose all their rites and ceremonies are directed They have however some imperfect notions of the immateriality and immortality of the soul and assign their heroes and chiefs seats above the clouds where when they arrive they are to live for ever They have like the Heathens a plurality of gods but we do not find that like the ancient patriarchs they carry any of their gods about with them They believe in good and bad spirits inhabitants of air earth and water who never are seen but whose power are made apparent by their effects  Whatever their plan of government may be it seems general throughout the friendly islands and it is certain that no people upon earth appear to be better regulated The subordination how humiliating soever it may be is submitted to without a murmur No discontent appeared among the inferior classes of the people during the three months the ships continued among them and it was observable that the jealousies if any originated among the Chiefs the common people were all submission  They do not offer up human sacrifices to their Deities as they do in the Society Isles neither was any animal whatever slain for that purpose while the ships remained at any of the friendly ports  The burials of their Chiefs and their mournings are very solemn and universal and they have days set apart for abstinence from food and labour but no sabbath or periodical assemblies for the celebration of divine worship Their buryingplaces indeed are consecrated and they have priests who are principals in all their ceremonies  Such are the imperfect outlines of their devotions and such is the simple plan of their government regulated by no written laws but subject to correction as a child to its parent and upon all solemn or necessary occasions called upon in the same manner  At six in the morning we weighed Capt Cook having first given the Cape Ram and two Ewes to Taoofa they having been slighted by Maveewagee and reserved for the present Chiefs who promised to take great care of them and where there was a great chance of their propagating as there were no dogs on the island We were soon under sail steering our course to the Southward to fetch a wind to carry us to our intended port  On the th we were out of sight of land when in lat S the wind shifting fair W N W with hard gales which continuing for several days  On the d we found our ship leaky and no possibility of stopping her leaks till we could make land All hands were employed in pumping out the water and when we found it did not increase upon us the leak gave us little or no concern  Nothing remarkable till the th when in lat the weather became tempestuous and a sudden squall carried away our maintop and topgallant masts split our mainsail and carried away the jib It is astonishing to see with what spirit and alacrity English sailors exert themselves Amidst a storm when it is almost impossible for a landsman to trust himself upon deck our sailors mounted aloft and with incredible rapidity cleared away the wreck by which they preserved the ship Nothing equal to this disaster had befallen us before in the course of the voyage During the night we hoisted lights and fired guns of distress but neither were seen nor heard by the Resolution  The storm continuing with unabated fury during the night and all next day we handed our sails and scudded under our foresail and mizen staysail at the rate of seven and eight knots an hour and at length were obliged to lieto with our ship's head to the West course E N E  On the st we got fight of the Resolution about four leagues to leeward She had damaged her maintopmast head but had secured it and was otherwise in perfect repair Lat long  August the st we celebrated the anniversary of our departure from England having just been one year absent The men were allowed a double allowance of grog and they forgot in the jollity of their cups the hardships to which they were exposed in the storm  On the d our carpenters were employed in replacing the old topmast with a new one but just as they had got it in readiness to point the base of the topmast through the maintop they discovered to our unspeakable grief that the mainmast head was shattered four or five feet below the top This put an end to our labour at this time The topmast was lowered till the mainmast could be secured which was a work of infinite difficulty in our situation and could not be accomplished without the assistance of the carpenters from the Resolution The signal of distress was thrown out but the sea ran so high that no boat could live In this situation we continued till the storm abated when the mast being lashed a spare jibboom was got up for a maintopmast and a mizen topsail yard for a topsail yard and thus equipped we made what sail we could the Resolution shortening sail to keep us company Lat  long  In this crazy condition with our leaks rather increased we met with a storm  On the d which required the utmost exertion of our strength to encounter every hand in the ship was employed some at the pumps and others in handing the sails which was a work of the greatest danger yet happily accomplished without any accident  On the th at six in the evening the man at the masthead called out Land which was joyful news to all on board and about seven we stood in for it About eleven we saw several canoes paddling towards the ships in each of which were three naked Indians We made signs for them to come on board which they declined but made signs for us to land Our boats were instantly hoisted out and sent to sound but no anchorage being found it was resolved to pursue our voyage without losing any more time This island Toobouai was a new discovery Its latitude by observation long E The men appeared of the largest stature tattowed from head to foot the language different from any we were yet acquainted with and their dress nothing but a piece of matting round the waist like that of the Amsterdamers their complexion darker their heads ornamented with shells feathers and flowers and their canoes elegantly carved and neatly constructed Of their manners we could form little or no judgment They appeared timid but by their waving green boughs and exhibiting other signs of peace they gave us reason to believe that they were friendly They exchanged some small fish and cocoanuts for nails and Middleburgh cloth The appearance of the island as we approached it was lofty but small Its greatest  length about four leagues and its breadth about two leagues  We now proceeded with an easy breeze till  The th when we saw the island of Maitea  The th the man at the masthead called out Land distant about seven or eight leagues we soon perceived it to be the island of Otaheite of which we were in pursuit Lat  On the th about six in the morning we stood in for the land and before night were safely moored in the harbour called by the natives Oheite Peeha Here we were surrounded by an incredible number of canoes filled with natives besides men women and children who swam to the ships expressing their joy at our arrival We were scarce moored before a Chief named Ootee came on board the Resolution to welcome Capt Cook He was attended by Omai's brotherinlaw who took little or no notice of Omai till taking him down into the cabin and shewing him his treasure of red feathers and giving him a few the news of his riches presently spread and Ootee who would scarce speak to him before now begged that they might be  tayo's  and exchange names Omai accepted the honour and made him a present of some red feathers and Ootee by way of return sent ashore for a hog 'Twas visible to all on board that it was not the man but the red feathers that was of consequence  They were now eager to enter into conversation with Omai and informed Capts Cook through his means of the arrival in that port of two Spanish ships from Lima who had twice visited them that at their departure the first time they had taken four of the natives with them and had left four of their people in their room two priests a servant and a person named Mateema who was  highly spoken of by the natives That they had built a house on shore and erected a cross with an inscription which were still standing that they had left some cattle with goats sheep and geese but that most of them were dead that they promised to return soon which they did and brought two of the natives back the other two having died at Lima and that they had taken their own people back but had left their house standing  Dinner was no sooner over than both Captains accompanied by Omai went on shore and visited the Spanish erections which seemed to indicate a deeper design than the natives were aware of they had taken possession of the island in the name of his Catholic Majesty and had inscribed the cross with the King's name Carolus III imperat which Capt Cook took the liberty to deface and on the other side of the post caused the following memorial to be inscribed Georgius Tertius Rex Annis Here the natives pointed out to them the grave of the Commodore who died there while the ships lay in the bay the first time Most of the fresh provisions with which we were supplied at the Friendly Isles being expended in the voyage orders were given to prohibit all trade with the natives except for provisions and that only with such persons as were appointed by the Commanders as purveyors for the ships By this necessary regulation fresh provisions were soon procured in plenty and every man was allowed a pound and a half of pork every day On this day the crews of both ships were made acquainted with the course they were to steer and the reward to which they should be entitled by act of parliament should they discover a communication between  the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean and also if they should sail beyond the th degree of Northern latitude At the same time it was left to their choice to share the usual allowance of grog now or reserve it till they should come to the cold regions of the North when double allowance would probably be necessary The crews of both ships were unanimous for giving up their grog and substituting the milk of the cocoanut in its room  On the th Omai was put in possession of the house the Spaniards had built his bed put up in it after the English fashion and he was indulged to sleep on shore during our short stay at this part of the island Here also the live stock were landed and put to graze in the meadows that bordered on the shore  On the th Capt Cook with Omai took an airing to the great astonishment of the inhabitants many hundreds or whom followed them with loud acclamations Omai to excite their admiration the more was dressed capapee in a suit of armour which he carried with him and was mounted and caparisoned with his sword and pike like St George accoutred to kill the dragon only that instead of a long sword Omai had pistols hung to his girdle which he sometimes made good use of when the crowd became troublesome to drive them suddenly away  The chief of this part of the island a minor being absent when the ships arrived the news had been rapidly conveyed to him and he was just returned as the ships were preparing to depart Word was brought on board the Resolution that young Waheindooa for that was the name of the chief wanted to see Capt Cook and accordingly the Captain and Omai went on shore  to pay as was customary the first visit They were received with form The chiefs were all assembled Capt Cook was informed of the errand of the Spaniards to take possession of their island but they were ready to make a formal surrender of it to Capt Cook In confirmation of this grant the young Prince was desired to pay homage to the Captain and to embrace him  This ceremony ended Omai who had prepared a  maro  composed of red and yellow feathers which he intended for Otoo king of the whole island was fool enough to present it to Waheiadooa to be by him forwarded to Otoo He thought by this management to have secured the favour of both but the contrary was the effect for the most valuable part of the present was kept behind and not a th part was presented to Otoo The first did not thank him and the latter took it as an affront Some presents passed between the Captains and the Chiefs and while the live stock was grazing the Commanders and officers employed their leisure time in surveying the island In their walks some officers discovered what they thought a Romish chapel but what Capt Cook afterwards found to be a  toopapaoo  or sacred repository where the remains of old Waheiadooa lay in state It was uncommonly neat and had two priests as attendants  For these last two or three days the caulkers from both ships were employed in stopping the leaks of the Discovery and the carpenters in securing the masts till we should arrive at the port of Mattavai where the ships were to undergo a thorough repair  On the th and th it blew a hard gale and we were obliged to veer out fathom more of  our best bower cable for safety as we rode hard at our moorings  On the st the signal was made for unmooring  Early on the d in the morning the live stock were taken on board and about nine we weighed and sailed accompanied with several canoes though the wind blew a storm and we sailed under the doublereefed topsails In the evening the Resolution took her old station in Mattavai Bay but the wind suddenly shifting and the breeze coming full from the land we were driven three leagues to leeward of the bay by which we were reduced to the necessity of working all night to windward amidst thunder lightning and rain and among reefs of coral rocks on which we every moment expected to perish We burnt false fires and fired several guns of distress but no answer from the Resolution nor could we see any object to direct us during this perilous night  Before our departure one of their Eatooas or prophesying priests had prophesied that we should not land at Mattavai that day These impostors are held in great esteem through all the Friendly Islands and this accident though it might have been easily foreseen increased their veneration  In the morning of the d however the weather cleared up and we could see the Resolution about three leagues to windward when a shift of wind happening in our favour we took advantage of it and by twelve at noon were safely moored within a cable's length of the Resolution It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the joy which the natives expressed upon our arrival in this bay because their manner of expressing joy is  so different from our sensations that were we to see persons stabbing themselves with sharp instruments till their bodies were besmeared with blood we should think they were pierced with the most frantic despair and that it would be almost impossible to assuage their grief whereas here beating their breasts tearing their hair and pricking their heads their hands and their bodies are the most significant signs of their gladness to see the friends they love best At the same time they are ready to overwhelm you with kindness and would give you for the moment all they have in the world but the very next hour crave all back again and like children teize you for every think you have got besides  The ships were no sooner secured than the sailors began stripping them of every yard of rigging they had left for certainly no ships were ever in a more shattered condition Our voyage from New Zealand if not from the Cape might be said to be one continued series of tempestuous weather suspended only by a few intervals of sunshine and the employment of our artificers at sea and on shore a laborious exertion of their umost skill to keep us above water Here it was not only necessary to strip the mainmast of the Discovery but to take it out and carry it on shore to be properly secured This was a work of no small difficulty Here too it was found necessary to unship our stores of every kind to air and unpack the powder newbake that part of the bread that had contracted any dampness to erect the forge on shore and in short to set all our artificers to work on board and on shore to refit the ships for the further prosecution of the voyage  A messenger was dispatched from Capt Cook to King Ottoo to acquaint him with our arrival and to desire his permission to send the cattle we had brought from Britain to feed in the pastures of Opparree The king expressed his joy on the return of Capt Cook and readily gave his consent He at the same time ordered one of his principal officers to accompany the messenger in his return and to take with him presents of fresh provisions for the Commanders of both ships and to invite them on shore to dine with him the next day This invitation was accepted and it was agreed between the Captains that their visit should be made with as much state as their present circumstances would admit The marines and music were therefore ordered to be in readiness at an appointed hour and all the rowers to be clean dressed  On the th about noon the commanders with the principal officers and gentlemen embarked on board the pinnaces which on this occasion were dressed with all their decorations Omai to surprize the more was clothed in a Captain's uniform and could hardly be distinguished by any of the multitude then assembled from a British officer  From Mattavai to Opparree was about three miles They arrived at the landingplace about one o'clock in the afternoon and were received by the marines already under arms As soon as the company were disembarked the whole band of music struck up a grand military march and the procession began The road from the beach to the entrance of the palace about half a mile was lined on both sides with natives from all parts expecting to see Omai on horseback as  the account of his appearance on his first landing on the other side of the island had already reached the inhabitants of this As he appeared to them in disguise he was not known they were not however wholly disappointed as the grandeur of the procession exceeded every thing of the kind they had ever seen The whole court were likewise assembled and the king with his sisters on the approach of Capt Cook came forth to meet him As he was perfectly known to them their first salutations were frank and friendly according to the known customs of the Otaheiteans and when these salutations were over proper attention was paid to every gentleman in company and that too with a politeness that to those who had never been on this island before was quite unexpected  As soon as the company had entered the palace and were seated and some discourse had passed between the king and Capt Cook Omai was presented to his Majesty He had hitherto escaped unnoticed with the other inferior officers who were not particularly known Omai paid his Majesty the usual homage of a subject to a sovereign in that country which was kneeling and embracing his foot and then entered into familiar conversation on the subject of his travels The Earees or kings of this country are not above discoursing with the meanest of their subjects but Omai was now considered here as a person of rank and a favourite of the Earees of the ships The king having received from him a valuable present was desirous to hear his story and asked him several questions before he gave him time to answer one At length Omai began by magnifying the grandeur of the Great King he compared the splendor of his court to the brilliancy  of the stars in the firmament the extent of his dominions by the vast expanse of heaven the greatness of his power by the thunder that shakes the earth He said the Great King of Pretanne had three hundred thousand warriors every day at his command clothed like those who now attended the Earees of the ships and more than double that number of sailors who traversed the globe from the rising of the fun to his setting that his ships of war exceeded those at Mattavai in magnitude in the same proportion as those exceeded the small canoes at OpparreeHis Majesty appeared all astonishment and could not help interrupting him He asked if what he said was true Where the Great King could find people to navigate so many ships as covered the ocean from one extremity to the other and if he could find men where he could find provisions for so great a multitude Omai assured him that he had spoken nothing but truth that in one city only on the banks of a river far removed from the sea there were more people than were contained in the whole group of islands with which his Majesty was acquainted that the country was full of large populous cities notwithstanding which provisions were so plentiful that for a piece of certain yellow metal like that of which he had seen many meaning the medals given by the Captain to the Earees the Great King could purchase as much provisions as would maintain a sailor on board a ship a whole year that in the country of the Great King there are more than different kinds of fourfooted animals from the size of the smallest rat when it is first brought forth to the magnitude of a stage erected on an ordinary canoe on which six men may stand erect that all these animals are so numerous in  their several kinds and propagate so fast that were it not that some were killed for food and that others prey one upon the other they would overrun the land Omai having by this relation obviated king Ottoo's doubts adverted to his first questions He said the ships of war of Pretanne were furnished with poopoos guns each of which would receive the largest poopoo his Majesty had yet seen within it that some carried and more of those poopoos with suitable accommodations for a thousand fighting men and stowage for all sorts of cordage and warlike stores besides provisions and water for the men and other animals for or days and that they were sometimes abroad as long warring with the enemies of the Great King in the different parts of his dominions in the remotest parts of the earth that they frequently carried with them in these expeditions poopoos that would hold a small hog within them and which throw hollow globes of iron of a vast bigness filled with fire and all manner of combustibles and implements of destruction to a great distance a few of which were they to be thrown among the fleet of Otaheite would set them on fire and destroy the whole navy in less than half a day were they ever so numerous The king seemed more astonished than delighted with what he said and suddenly left Omai to join the company that were in conversation with Capt Cook and the other officers  After the hurry of the visit was over we were conducted to the waterside in the same manner as we approached the palace and were attended by the king and most of the chiefs  Soon after our arrival one of the natives who had been at Lima came and visited us He retained  a few Spanish words which he had learnt at Lima and  Si Senore  was as ready on all occasions as was  if you please Sir  or  as you please Sir  with Oedidee who had formerly accompanied Capt Cook in a seven months voyage in which he had visited the Friendly Islands New Zealand Easter Island and the Marquses These two were our constant visitors while the ships stayed and afforded a good deal of diversion to the crews  On the th in the morning Omai's mother and several of his relations arrived Their meeting was too unnatural to be pleasing We eould not see a woman frantically striking her face and arms with sharks teeth till she was all over besmeared with blood without being hurt As it conveyed no idea of joy to feeling minds we could never be reconciled to this absurd custom She brought with her several large hogs with breadfruit bananos and other productions of the Island of Ulitea as presents to the Captains and she and her friends received in return a great variety of cutlery such as knives scissars files c besides some red feathers which last were even more acceptable than iron They continued to visit the ship occasionally till we quitted the island  Before noon king Ottoo with his chiefs and attendants and two young princesses his sisters came on board followed by several canoes laden with provisions sufficient to have served both ships a week They were entertained as usual with a sight of all the curiosities on board the ships and the young princesses longing for almost every thing they saw were gratified to their utmost wishes with bracelets of beads lookingglasses bits of china artificial nosegays and a variety  of other trinkets of which they had one of a sort each while at the same time the king and his chiefs amused themselves with the carpenters armourers and other artificers employed in the repairs of the ships casting longing eyes on the tools and implements with which they performed their work In this manner they past the time till dinner was ready King Ottoo with his chiefs dined with the Captains the principal officers and Omai in the great cabin while the ladies were feasted in an apartment separated on purpose and waited upon by their own servants During dinner the music particularly the bagpipes with which the Ottaheiteans seemed most delighted continued to play and the young ladies who were within hearing though out of sight could hardly refrain from dancing the whole time After dinner the king and his chiefs were pressed to drink wine but most of them having felt its power before declined tasting it one or two drank a glass but refused to drink any more  What contributed not a little to increase the pleasure of the king was a present made him by Capt Cook of a large quantity of the choicest red feathers that could be purchased in the islands of Amsterdam Red feathers as has already been observed are held in the highest estimation in Otaheite where when the ships first arrived a quantity of them not greater than might be got from a tomtit would have purchased a hog but every sailor being furnished with them they sunk per cent in value They are here used as amulets or rather as propitiations to make their prayers acceptable to the good spirit whom they invoke with tufts of those feathers in their hands made up in a peculiar manner and held in a certain position with much seeming solemnity  Of this Capt Cook was an eyewitness when he went afterwards to be present at a human sacrifice of which two were offered up while we lay moored in the harbour of Mattavai In the course of Capt Cook's former voyage the name of Towha frequently occurrs as Admiral in Chief of the naval force of Otaheite  From this chief on the st of September a messenger arrived at Oparree with advice that he had killed a man to be sacrificed to the Eatooa to implore the assistance of that god against Eimea and to require the presence of king Ottoo at the ceremony without which it could not be performed This horrid rite was to be solemnized in consequence of a war which had subsisted for some years between the Island of Otaheite and that of Eimea and which was now come to a crisis The poor victim as it appeared had been knocked on the head a day or two before the ceremony was to take place and the priests had been preparing for the solemnization in which however there was nothing so very horrid as might have been expected The chief sacrifices were dogs and pigs over the entrails of which the priests made long prayers and incantations holding at the same time tufts of red feathers in their hands knotted in various forms During the ceremony a  mara  or royal girdle was spread out at full length it was about five yards long and fifteen inches broad ornamented with red and yellow feathers these last taken from a dove found upon the island and curiously disposed so as to produce a most pleasing effect and besides this display of royal magnificence there was a kind of ark exhibited the mystical contents of which were kept secret and were supposed to represent the Eatooa to whom the sacrifice was offered up  The poor victim who had been killed had but a small share in the exhibition After having been exposed a few hours in various attitudes sometimes masked and sometimes covered with young plantaintrees and prayers and petitions seemingly addressed to him had been said or sung in a plaintive tone the body was buried in a grave about two feet deep and then the priests proceeded with the usual offerings of dogs and pigs these were dressed in the nicest manner and their entrails after being cautiously and carefully examined were thrown into the fire and consumed from these it should seem that their good and bad omens were prognosticated The sacrificed pig with his liver were now put upon a  whatta  or scaffold and the carcass of the dog was deposited by him on the same shelf and then all the feathers except an ostrich plume were inclosed within the Eatooa in the ark and the ceremony finally closedWhoever is desirous of reading the account at large may see it very accurately stated by Capt Cook who was an eyewitness to it in the d volume of his voyages pages and He remarks that the victim is always of the lowest class is generally some worthless wretch who is suddenly put to death without the least notice and who is slaughtered as oxen are with us by a single blow  The ordinary sorts of red feathers were collected by officers and men all over the Friendly Islands but those that were presented to king Ottoo and were now exhibited were of the superior kind and were in value much above the ordinary red feathers as real pearls are with us in value above French paste They were taken from the heads of the paroquets of Tongataboo and Eaoowhe  which are of superlative beauty and precious in proportion to their sineness and the vivid glow of their dazzling colours  Though all public trade was prohibited as was usual till the ships should be furnished with fresh provisions it was not easy to restrain the men on shore from trading with the women who were for ever enticing them to desert The ladies of pleasure in London have not half the winning ways that are practised by the Otaheitean misses allure their gallants With the seeming innocence of doves they mingle the wiliness of serpents They have however one quality which is peculiar to themselves and that is constancy When once they have made their choice it must be owing to the sailor himself if his mistress ever proves false to him No women upon earth are more faithful They will endeavour to make themselves mistresses of all their lovers possess but they will suffer no one else to invade his property nor will they embezzle any part of it themselves without having first obtained his content but that consent is not easily withheld for they are incessant in their importunities and will never cease asking while the sailor has a rag or a nail to bestow  Next day August a party of officers made a visit to Ottoo at Oparree taking with them the poultry with which Capt Cook was to stock the island of Otaheite these consisted of a peacock and hen a turkeycock and hen one gander and three geese a drake and four ducks They found at the palace there a gander which had been given to Oberea by Capt Wallis ten years before several goats and a bull which the Spaniards had left when they last visited the island about eight months ago It was tied to a tree alone  the cows having either died on their passage or were carried back to Spain Capt Cook sent three cows he had on board to this bull for a finer was never seen and his own bull he landed at Mattavai  At Oparree Capt Cook planted melons potatoes shaddocks pineapple plants and some vines he had the pleasure of seeing several of them in great forwardness before he left the island  During our four months stay at this and the neighbouring islands there was hardly a sailor on board that had not made a very near connection with one or other of the women of this island nor indeed many officers that were proof against the allurements of the better sort who were no less amorous and artful though more reserved than those of the inferior order  The temperature of the climate the plenty of fresh provisions fish fowl pork breadfruit yams a kind of sweet potatoes which they have the art of stewing with their pork in a very savoury manner added to the most delicious fruits of the island contributed not a little to make our stay here not only tolerable but even desirable nor did idleness get possession even of those who were most indolently inclined We had not a vacant hour between business and pleasure that was unemployed We wanted no coffeehouses to kill time nor Ranelaghs or Vauxhalls for our evening entertainments Every nightly assembly in the plantations of this happy isle is furnished by beneficent nature with a more luxuriant feast than all the dainties of the most sumptuous champetre though lavished with unlimited profusion and emblazoned with the most expensive decorations of art Ten thousand lamps combined and ranged in the most advantageous order by the  hands of the best artists appear faint when compared with the brilliant stars of heaven that unite their splendor to illuminate the groves the lawns the streams of Oparree In these Elysian fields immortality alone is wanting to the enjoyment of all those pleasures which the poet's fancy has conferred on the shades of departed heroes as the highest rewards of heroic virtue  But amidst so many delights it was not for human nature to subsist long without satiety Our seamen began to be licentious and our officers to be punctilious Several of the former were severely punished for indecency in surpassing the vice of the natives by their shameless manner of indulging their sensual appetites and two of the latter went ashore to terminate an affair of honour by the decision of their pistols It happened that neither of them were dextrous marksmen they vented their rage by the fury with which they began the attack and after discharging three balls each they returned on board without any hurt except spoiling a hat a ball having pierced it and grazed upon the head of him who wore it It was however remarked that these gentlemen were better friends than ever during the remaining part of the voyage  While these things went on by way of amusement to some others were more usefully employed in the repairs of the ship The mast that was shattered in the head and carried ashore to be repaired was in a short time rendered more firm than ever the sails that had been split and were otherwise rendered unfit for further service were replaced the cordage carefully examined the masts new rigged and in short the whole repairs compleated with more celerity and strength than could have been expected in a place where  depiction of the landing at Tahiti  Dodd del  Omai's Public Entry on his first landing at Otaheite  many conveniencies were wanting to fit us out for that part of our voyage which still remained to be performed  For this purpose repairs were not more necessary for our equipment than provisions The purveyors therefore and butchers were incessantly employed in purchasing and killing hogs for present use and the salters in salting the overplus for future stores while the Captains and superior officers were devising new amusements to keep the King and his Chiefs in good humour in order to encourage their people to furnish us with ample supplies  Not a day passed but some new exhibition was contrived for their entertainment Omai of whom little account was made but for his riches contributed his share to vary the scenes of pleasure He one day endeavoured to ride out on horseback in his armour brandishing his glittering sword to the terror and amazement of the gaping multitude when lo he was brought to the ground by a sudden start of his spirited horse Another day he diverted them with playing off fireworks under the direction of the chief engineer He was now made a principal in all public shews and was pushed forward with King Ottoo himself In a naval review which was exhibited by Towha the great Admiral Omai had the command of one division of the fleet while King Ottoo commanded another division and Towha the centre The greatest dexterity appeared in their arrangements to land where the military exercises were chiefly carried on one party endeavouring to supplant the other in order to get possession of the most advantageous ground In these manoeuvres Omai acquitted himself with tolerable applause being well supported in all his  exercises by Capt Cook who played him off as having been much improved in arts and military exercises  During our stay there was a rumour of actual war and the forces of the island both by sea and land were called forth in earnest to be in readiness to embark on the first notice This war it seems had originated in when Capt Cook was here before and in part had subsisted ever since neither side caring to come to action but it now came to a crisis and news was brought that the Otaheitean party in Eimeo had been worsted and had fled to the mountains and that a reinforcement was absolutely necessary All trade was therefore stopped no cocoanuts to be had the milk of which was the only liquor except water which the ship's company were allowed to drink and the weather being excessive hot there was great murmuring among the men both on board and on shore Capt Cook was under the necessity of interceding with King Ottoo to renew trade Whether peace was made or only a truce for a short time is not certain but in a few days the warriors dispersed and every thing went on again after the usual manner  On the above rumour it was computed that near war canoes were mustered in Mattavai bay with stages on each on which sat from three to fix Chiefs in their warlike dresses which seemed calculated more for shew than use in battle On their heads were large turbans wound round in many folds and over that a monstrous helmet and on their bodies instead of the light airy dress worn in common they were incumbered by many garments of their own cloth which added indeed to their stature but which must disqualify them from exerting their strength in the day of battle  Men of fertile imaginations fond of tracing the analogy of ancient customs among the different nations of the world might possibly discover some similarity between these cumbrous dresses and those of the Knights of ancient chivalry who fought in armour It is certain that the Otaheitean who fights on foot must feel the same encumbrance from his heavy wardress as the ancient Knight who fought on horseback must have done from his unwieldy armour and there is no doubt but the former will one time or other be laid aside in the tropical isles as much as the latter is now in every other part of the world  Soon after the first interview Oedidee of whom we have spoken brought a wife on board the Resolution whom he had lately married which discredits the notion that was universally believed by former Voyagers that those who belonged to the society of Arreoys were sworn to celibacy Either this man was an impostor or the fact just mentioned cannot be true He appeared in a rich English dress which had been sent him as a present from England perhaps from the Admiralty They were kindly received by Capt Cook and had much respect paid them Soon after his arrival fireworks of a new device were played off before many thousands of the natives but it was easy to remark that they were not all equally delighted with the exhibition  The common people were thrown into the utmost consternation by a storm of thunder and lightning which almost instantly succeeded Nor were they ever perfectly reconciled to us afterwards They thought it presumption in us to provoke the Eatooas by imitating their powers and many of them retired to the woods and never returned again to their houses during our stay  Our Journalist seems here to have been wanting in true intelligence The reason of their flight was a capital robbery that had been committed on the Surgeon's Mate of the Resolution who having taken a tour into the country had taken hatchets with him to purchase curiosities and was robbed of them all by the native whom he employed to carry them This alarmed the whole island Even Ottoo himself had taken flight in dread of the consequences but was brought back by Capt Cook who followed him and assured him he would take no part in the affair as the gentlemen themselves might seek their remedy if they took the liberty of rambling abroad without leave  Whether they really wished us to be gone or dreaded our stay an alarm was soon after spread that two Spanish ships were arrived at Oaite Peeha that they had landed some men there and were taking in some refreshments to enable them to proceed This report was every where circulated and whether Capt Cook believed it or only made it a pretence to quicken our activity he gave instant orders to clear the decks mount the guns which lay as it were buried in the hold and to get every thing in readiness for action In the mean time he sent Mr Williamson d Lieutenant in the great cutter manned and armed to learn the truth of the report by looking into the harbour of Oaite Peeha to see if any foreign ships were at anchor there or whether the whole rumour was a fiction That gentleman executed his commission with great celerity having in much less time than was expected twice doubled Point Venus sailed round that promontory made the harbour he was sent to examine and brought word that the only grounds for the report were  that four large trading canoes from an adjacent isle had been there a few days before his arrival but that they sailed again immediately having been totally disappointed of a market  Though we were now relieved of the apprehensions of an attack we were not suffered to relax in our preparations to depart Wood and water had already been taken on board and as much provisions as could be procured and little remained to be done except to reimbark our live stock to strike the tents and bring off the baggage of the officers and men who had been stationed on shore Notice was therefore given to King Ottoo of our intentions to sail with the first fair wind He seemed to express great concern at our sudden resolution and came on board attended with Towha his great Admiral and the principal officers of his court who all brought with them presents of hogs and fruit the only valuable productions of the island except wood and water to European Voyagers and received in return axes hatchets spikenails and cutlery ware c which were reserved to the last in order to encourage the Chiefs to use their utmost endeavours with their people to bring in their hogs while it was yet in our power to receive them No people on earth could express their gratitude with more seeming sincerity than the King and his Chiefs for the presents they had received nor were our Commanders and Officers wanting in suitable returns  On the th having now been just days on the island King Ottoo came on board to invite our Commanders with their Officers to Oparree as he understood it was to be the last time that he should have the opportunity of paying us his acknowledgments on shore  On the th the pinnaces were ordered out and we proceeded to Oparree in the same state as on our first visit At the landingplace we were received with uncommon marks of friendship Every Chief in that part of the island of which Ottoo was the Eareedahai or Lord paramount to the number of and more attended and conducted us to the King's house or palace where a sumptuous banquet was provided and after dinner a more numerous and brilliant company of performers assembled at the Theatre for our entertainment than we had ever seen on any stage in the tropical islands before  There is a sameness in their drama that admits of little or no variation as perhaps to foreigners who are unacquainted with the language and manners of a country there may appear to be in every stageexhibition wherever performed Be that as it may the dresses on this occasion were entirely new and by far more showy than formerly the number of dancers were increased ten young Ladies composed the first group with their heads most magnificently ornamented with beads red feathers shells of the most beautiful colours and wreathed with flowers in so elegant a style as hardly to be excelled had their music been equal to their performance this part of the exhibition would have been compleat  A party of warriors were next introduced dressed in their warhabits consisting as has already been observed of different coloured cloth of their own manufacture so ingeniously fashioned and blended together with so much art as with the helmets that cover their heads to fill the stage with men of whose majestic figure it is not easy to convey an idea These were armed with spears lances and battleaxes and exhibited all the  depiction of a dramatic piece at Tahiti  Dodd del Royce Sc  Representation of the Heiva at Otaheite  forms of attack and defence which are practised in real action The principal performers were the King's brother and a Chief of gigantic stature who displayed such wonderful grimaces and distorsions of face and countenance by way of provocation and challenge as were not only laughable in some attitudes but terrible in others After these disappeared the players were brought forward and performed a more serious piece than we had yet seen at which the natives sat graver and more composed than usual And the whole performance concluded with a dance of ten boys drest in every respect like the girls in the first scene with their hair flowing in ringlets down their shoulders and their heads ornamented in a very theatrical style  When the play was over we returned to our boats attended by the whole assembly who accompanied us to the waterside where the King took a most affectionate leave  On the th Capt Cook ordered all the women to be put on shore which was a task not easily effected most of them being very loth to depart nor was it of much consequence as they found means afterwards to follow us to Hueheine Ulitea and the other Society Isles nor did they leave us till our final departure on our northern discoveries never more to return  Several of the sailors being very desirous to stay at Otaheite King Ottoo interested himself in their behalf and endeavoured to prevail on Capt Cook to grant their request but he peremptorily rejected every application of that kind though often repeated nor would he suffer any of the natives to enter on board though many would gladly have accompanied us wherever we intended to sail they had even been assured that we never  intended to visit their country any more Some of the women too would have followed their Ehoonoas or Pretanne husbands could they have been permitted but Capt Cook was equally averse to the taking any of the natives away as to the leaving any of his own people behind He was very sensible that when once cloyed with enjoyment they would reciprocally pine for home to which it would not be in their power to return and that for a little present gratification they would risque the happiness of the remaining part of their lives  King Ottoo when he found he could not obtain his wishes in this respect applied to Capt Cook for another favour which was to allow his carpenters to make him a chest or press to secure the treasures he had accumulated in presents and by way of traffic from the European Voyagers He even begged that it might be made so large that two men might sleep upon it as otherwise neither locks nor bars nor bolts would be sufficient to secure his treasure when the ships were gone This Capt Cook readily granted and while the workmen were employed in this service they were plentifully supplied with barbicued hogs and such dainties as the country afforded and were so carefully attended and protected that they did not lose so much as a single nail It was some of these workmen that Ottoo was so desirous to retain but these were of too much consequence on board to be parted with had there been no other motive for bringing them away nor was Ottoo much concerned about the departure of the rest  While the carpenters were busied in making this uncommon piece of furniture King Ottoo was constant in attending their operations and Omai had frequent conferences with him on the  subject of his travels He astonished him more by the relation he gave of the magnificence of the Morais in  Pretanne  than by all the wonders with which he had before surprized him When he told him that the King's morai was open to all comers and that the persons of the deceased Kings were to be seen as perfect to appearance as when in the vigour of youth he seemed to lament that his date of existence was to be limited with his life and that his remains were to perish while his Morai preserved no memory that he had ever had a being Omai endeavoured to impress him with an idea of the magnificence of the tombs and memorials of the dead that were to be seen in the Morais of Pretanne but having nothing to compare them to he was unable to make himself sufficiently understood nor was he more successful in describing the solemn grandeur of the places of worship where the people assembled every seventh day and at other stated times to offer up their prayers to the good spirit Of the splendour of the theatres he could speak more intelligibly as some faint idea of them might be gathered from what had been exhibited on board the ships and in the illuminations and fireworks played off on shore When Omai told him of the magnitude of the palaces and houses in Pretanne of their decorations and furniture of the extent of their plantations and the multitude of living animals with which they were stored he listened to him with particular attention as not doubting the truth of his relation but when he began to describe the roads and the rapidity with which the people travelled in carriages drawn by fourfooted animals no child could ever express greater surprize at Gulliver's travelling to the world of the moon on ganzas than Ottoo when Omai assured  him they could traverse an extent of ground equal to the whole length of the island of Otaheite in a single day  The King as appeared by his generosity to Omai was highly entertained by the story of his travels for when he went to take leave his Majesty presented him with a double canoe properly equipped and manned in the room of that which he purchased at New Zealand but that it should seem was constructed as a present to the Great King of Pritanne which Capt Cook could not take on board on account of its size  Every preparation for sailing being already compleated the live stock all on board except three cows and a bull two ewes and a ram two shegoats and the poultry already mentioned which were left as presents to King Ottoo  In the evening both ships were under sail directing their course to the westward to Eimeo accompanied by Omai in his Otaheitean vessel with his two New Zealand youths on board who discovered no uneasiness at their present situation nor any desire to return home  The island of Otaheite has already been so often and so accurately described and the manners customs and ways of living of the inhabitants so amply enlarged upon by former voyagers that little remains to be added The writer was attentive only to two facts one of which he found reason to believe had been misrepresented and the other very unfairly related the first respects the Society of Arreoys composed as it was said of a certain number of men and women associated in lewdness and so abandoned to all sense of humanity as to destroy the issue of their libidinous intercourse than which nothing could be more injurious to the characters of any people  than this diabolical practice ascribed to this society  There are in this and the adjoining islands persons of a middle rank between the Manahounas or Yeomen and the Earees who having no concern in the government nor any distinct property in the islands associate together for their own amusement and the entertainment of the public These travel from place to place and from island to island in companies not unlike those of the strolling players in England only that they perform without pay but that they cohabit indiscriminately one with another so many men with so many women in common is no otherwise true than the same may be suspected among the strolling companies just mentioned nor are they under any other restraints from marrying than that the society admits of no marriages among themselves nor of any married people to be of their society it being a rule with them never to be encumbered with children if therefore it should happen that issue should prove the consequence of a casual amour there is no alternative the mother must either quit the society or somehow or other dispose of her child which some of them do there as many unfortunate girls do here by secretly making away with them to avoid infamy it being equally disgraceful there to be found with child while members of the Society of Arreoys as it is for women here to be so found without husbands  The other fact which the writer took pains to determine was whether the beastly custom imputed to them of gratifying their passions without regard to places or persons was well founded and he solemnly declares that the grossest indecencies he ever saw practised while on the island were by the licentiousness of our own people who  without regard to character made no scruple to attempt openly and by force what they were unable to effect with the free voluntary consent of the objects of their desire for which several of them were severely punished To assert therefore that not the least trace of shame is to be found among these people in doing that openly which all other people are naturally induced to cover is an injurious calumny not warranted by custom nor supported by the general practice even of the lowest class of individuals among them  These people have one custom in common with the Neapolitans and Maltese which ought not to be forgotten and that is their fishing in the night and reposing themselves in the day like them too they burn lamps while they fish with the oil drawn from the cocoanut which they know well how to extract  On the th we continued our course the whole day under doublereefed topsails and in the evening came in sight of Eimeo where we anchored next day in a safe harbour and were received by the people with every appearance of hospitality  On the st our livestock was landed and as our supply of wood at Otaheite was little more than just served for present use our carpenters and wooders were here sent out to cut wood and our purveyors to collect hogs Here we found Omai who had outsailed us in his doublemasted canoe and who on his arrival had been diverting the natives with his feats of arms and had raised their curiosity to a very high degree by acquainting them with our intention of paying them a visit as no European ship had ever anchored at that island before The Chiefs of the island came on board with large hogs by way of presents and  were presented in return with axes hatchets lookingglasses and red feathers our purveyors were likewise much gratified by the success they met with in marketing purchasing the largest hogs for the meerest trifles as for instance a hog of weight for twelve red feathers and so in proportion for less or larger  But this friendly intercourse was soon changed to a scene of desolation that no injury we could receive from the pilfering disposition of the inhabitants could justify The people had brought us every thing their island afforded and had left it to the generosity of the purchasers to give in return whatever they pleased but unfortunately  On the d of October a goat was missing from the livestock It had been secretly conveyed away in the night from the pastures on which they were placed to feed notwithstanding the vigilance of the guard appointed to look after them With the loss of this animal which no doubt was looked upon as a prize of great value the Earee of the island was made acquainted by Capt Cook and a peremptory requisiton made to have it restored on pain of having his country laid waste his shipping destroyed and himself personally punished for the crime of his subjects The King promised his assistance and required time for enquiry but as soon as he was at liberty he absconded and was no more seen and the goat being still missing and no means used for recovering and restoring it a party from both ships with the marines in a body were ordered out to search for it and bring it back or if it could not be found to carry the threats of the Commander into execution For three days successively they continued their search without effect till tired with the trifling evasions of the Chief they began first  by burning the suspected houses where they had reason to think the goat was concealed and that not succeeding the devastation became general burning and destroying indiscriminately some of the best houses and as many of their large war canoes as fell in their way at the same time cutting down their fruittrees and destroying their plantations The natives who lived at a distance hearing of the havock that was made near the bay filled their canoes with stones and sunk them in hopes of preserving them but that availed them nothing The Captain ordered boats to be manned and armed the canoes that were sunk to be weighed up and destroyed and in short a general devastation to be carried thro' the whole island if the goat should be withheld Add to this that two young natives of quality being found on board our ship were made prisoners and told they were to be put to death if the goat should not be restored within a certain time The youths protested their own innocence and disclaimed all knowledge of the guilty persons notwithstanding which every preparation was apparently made for putting them to death Large ropes were carried upon the main deck and made fast sore and aft axes chains and instruments of torture were placed upon the quarter deck in the sight of the young men whose terrors were increased b  the information of Omai who gave them to understand that by all these solemn preparations their doom was finally determined Under these apprehensions the poor youths remained till  The th when about three in the afternoon a body of between and natives were  from the ship hastening to the harbour who when they came near held up the goat in their arms  in raptures that they had found it and that it was still alive  The joy of the imprisoned youths is not to be expressed and when they were released instead of shewing any signs of resentment they were ready to fall down and worship their deliverers It can scarce be credited when the devastation ceased how soon the injury they had suffered was forgotten and provisions again brought to market as if no violences had ever been committed by us only the Earee of the island never made his appearance Though this account was generally discredited on the first publication of this journal yet it now appears by the relation of Capt Cook himself that it was well founded We have already observed that a war had long subsisted between King Ottoo and Mahaine the Earee of Eimeo and Capt Cook had been solicited to take part in it which he had declined and thereby had lost the friendship of Towha but after having burnt the houses of many of the enemies of Ottoo had broke up burnt and destroyed more than canoes most of them war canoes he regretted that he had been obliged to do them more mischief than they had suffered from Towha in his late expedition  All this while multitudes of the inhabitants of Otaheite who had stolen off in the night in their canoes mostly women were witnesses of the severity with which this theft was punished at Eimeo but it seemed to make no unfavourable impression upon them They continued their good offices as long as we remained in the Society Isles  Having procured a large quantity of wood of which Otaheite furnished but a scanty supply and likewise a number of hogs for present use and future stores  On the th in the morning we prepared to sail and before noon were out at sea with a fine breeze directing our course to N W for Hueheine to which island Omai had previously set sail before us  In the night the weather being hazy Omai lost sight of the ships and fired his gun which was answered by the Resolution During the afternoon the breeze left us and a dead calm ensuing made our Otaheitean passengers immoderately sick by the rolling of the ship They then began to repent their folly in following the fugitives whom they had no hopes of ever reclaiming and to wish themselves safe home again on the shores of Mattavai  On the th in the morning we came in sight of Hueheine and about noon were close in with the land when the natives came in multitudes with hogs and provisions of all kinds as presents to their friends Omai who had already reached the shore and hauled his vessel upon the beach was encircled by the natives who crowded about him some to gratify their curiosity and others to express their joy at his return In less than half an hour King Oreo was seen to go aboard the Resolution He had with him two large hogs as presents to Capt Cook with some breadfruit ready roasted and a large quantity of bananoes plantains and other fruit Capt Cook received him with open arms enquiring particularly after the good old venerable King Oree for whom he entertained the most perfect friendship and being told he was dead he could not help shedding tears We were soon after favoured with a visit from Oreo who made a like present to Capt Clerke and received in return a breastplate of red feathers  with which he seemed better pleased than with any thing that had before been given him  As soon as he returned on shore he issued out orders requiring all his people to behave with the strictest justice to his good friends from Pretanne and he appointed proper Officers to see his orders carried into execution but without effect for he had hardly reached his place of abode before one fellow was detected on board the Resolution in stealing iron from the armourer's forge and had one side of his head and eyebrows close shaved and both his ears cut clean from his temples by way of example to deter others  On the th peace being established in the usual form the live stock were landed among which were a horse and mare for Omai two cows and a bull were intended for King Oree if he had been alive but being dead were left with Oreo  As this was one of the most plentiful of all the Society Isles it was proposed to make some stay here in order to careen the ships and to lay in provisions for future use This was the more necessary as we were about to sail to countries wholly unknown where it was uncertain what accommodations we might meet with or to what straits we might be reduced The tents were therefore put ashore the beds and furniture of every kind unladen and every crevice of the ships examined scraped washed with vinegar and smoked and while this last operation was performing the lower portholes were left open for the rats to make their escape in short a thorough revision was directed to be made of every thing on board as well to cleanse the furniture from the vermin as to remove the danger of infection from putrid air generated by a perpetual succession of multitudes of both sexes in close resort between  decks ever since our arrival at Otaheite The sick were at the same time landed for the benefit of the air and every means used to recover and to preserve them in health when recovered  Among the sick was Capt Cook himself for whose recovery the crews of both ships were under much concern as the success of the voyage was thought in a great measure to depend upon his care and conduct By the Doctor's advice he was prevailed upon to sleep on shore where he was assiduously attended night and day by the Surgeons of both ships who alternately watched with him till he was out of danger As soon as he was able he rode out every day with Omai on horseback followed by multitudes of the natives who attracted by the novelty of the sight flocked from the remotest parts of the island to be spectators In the mean time the ships were crowded with hogs poured in upon us faster than the butchers and salters could dispatch them for several days after our arrival some hundreds great and small were brought on board and if any were refused they were thrown into the boats and left behind Breadfruit bananoes plantains cocoanuts and yams were brought in the same plentiful proportions and purchased for trifles Red feathers were here as at Otaheite a very marketable commodity with which the seamen made purchases of cloth and other manufactures of the island those of them who were followed by their misses from Otaheite kept separate tables for them at a small expence the misses catered and cooked for their mates who feasted every day on barbecued pigs stewed fowls roasted breadfruit cocoanuts and a variety of other delicacies which were purchased for them for the merest trifles Among the common men there were  many who laid in store of these good things for their future support in case of being reduced to short allowance and they had reason afterwards to console themselves on their provident care  The example made of the first Indian thief by exposing him to the ridicule of his countrymen had a better effect than a thousand lashings which were forgotten almost as soon as inflicted whereas the laughable figure the fellow made with his ears off and the hair of his head shaved was a perpetual punishment which it was not in his power to conceal By this seasonable severity and the vigilance of the Officers whom the King had appointed to superintend the police we continued unmolested for several days  On our first approaching the island we cast anchor till the ground for mooring should be examined and in weighing to change our station our cable parted and we were obliged to leave the anchor behind till we had more leisure to sway it up This proved a troublesome business in which we were at length assisted by the activity of the natives who at services of this kind are very alert By diving and properly fixing ropes they helped us to recover our anchor in a few hours which we had laboured at in vain for several days  The carpenters and caulkers had no sooner compleated their business on board than they were ordered on shore to erect a house for Omai who had been enabled by the generosity of Capt Cook and his other friends to purchase a small estate for a plantation in the cultivation of which he was to proceed after the English manner and to employ his two New Zealanders as labourers in digging and preparing the ground  The erection of a house of pretty large dimensions with stable and outoffices appendages new  and hitherto unnecessary in this country was a work of no small labour and could not be accomplished in any reasonable time without the assistance of many hands the carpenters and a number of labourers from both ships were therefore set to work and though a watch was placed to look after their workingtools the vigilance of Argos could not have secured the more than golden prize to them from so many crafty Jasons It happened however that a few chissels gimblets and other trifles were all that were missing for as no nails or iron were to be used in the construction of the buildings the saws axes adzes and larger tools were not so easy for them to carry off and conceal while therefore the chief attention of the sentinels were fixed upon these an Indian found means to carry off a quadrant from the astronomer's observatory and though it was almost instantly missed and the thief discovered and fired at while he was yet in  ight he found means to escape to the woods where he concealed his booty notwithstanding the most vigilant search At the firing of the gun and the bustle that succeeded among the Indians who were in crowds about the tents the marines on board took the alarm and putting themselves in arms hastened on shore where they found all quiet the thief having been found and brought in by some of his companions who were well rewarded for their fidelity The fellow was instantly taken on board and put in irons where he remained all night In the morning it appeared he was of some note as a number of hogs and great quantities of fruit and cloth were brought on board to purchase his release but without effect About noon he was brought to trial and sentenced to suffer the loss of both  his ears besides having his head shaved and his eyebrows fleed than which no punishment could have subjected him to greater disgrace In this bleeding condition he was sent on shore and exposed as a spectacle to intimidate the people from meddling for the future with what was not their own at the same time they were given to understand that theft among us was considered as a capital crime The Indians looked with horror upon the man and it was easy to perceive that this act gave them general disgust even Omai was affected though he endeavoured to justify it to his Indian friends by telling them that if such a crime had been committed in the country where he had been the thief would have been condemned to lose his life How well soever he might carry the matter off he dreaded the consequences to himself which in part appeared before we left the island and were probably more severely felt by him soon after we were gone However king Oreo and the chiefs about him still continued to keep up appearances they paid and received visits as usual made presents and accepted returns and suffered trade to go on between the inhabitants of the island and the ships companies as if no offence had been given At all their feasts and entertainments the Captains and Omai were invited to be guests and plays and fireworks succeeded each other by way of political finesse to promote harmony In the mean time another theft was committed at the same place Mr King the astronomer was robbed of his brandycase some plates and some knives and forks which he never recovered but his quadrant was brought back in a few days after it was stolen not at all damaged  On this occasion trade was again interrupted the Indians dreading to come to market when any of their people had been guilty of any fraud  Capt Cook though he rode out every day atttended by Omai still continued in a very weak condition but was visited and had great attention paid him by the chiefs he reasoned with Oreo on the absurd custom of suspending trade whenever any of his people had done us an injury represented the practice as equally hurtful to them as to us and that though the delinquent was liable to punishment no other person would ever be molested unless the course of justice was interrupted bv refusing to deliver up the criminal when detected This reasoning had its weight with Oreo and his chiefs who ordered the trade to be renewed as before We had now been in harbour in Owharre road in Hueheine more than thirty days during which time Omai's buildings were quite compleated and he had got all his effects and furniture on shore the European seeds with which Capt Cook had furnished him sown and part of his grounds planted with the fruit and other trees of the country in all which he was assisted with every spare hand from both ships  One would have imagined that seeing himself apparently the richest man in the island and possessed of much the finest house he would have been elated with his situation and overjoyed at being so happily placed but quite the reverse he wanted rank which was not in the power of fortune to confer and nothing but power could give consequence in a country where rank was not to be purchased the nearer therefore the time approached of our departure the more dejected he grew and when he had made an entertainment at taking possession of his new settlement  at which he was honoured with the company of the commanders and officers from both ships and with the king and chiefs of the island he could scarce conceal his trouble being apprehensive as he told Capt Clerke secretly that as soon as we were sailed they would level his building with the ground and make prize of all that he possessed Upon this occasion however Capt Cook who had all along treated him more like a son than a passenger and who was now pretty well recovered being acquained with the cause of his melancholy embraced this opportunity of recommending him to the protection of the king and the chiefs present intimating to them at the same time that if any violence should be offered to Omai or that he should be molested in the free enjoyment of his property he would upon the return of the ships for they entertained a notion that the return of the ships would be periodical lay waste the island and destroy every human being that had in any manner been instrumental in doing him an injury This threat made the deeper impression upon the chiess by what had lately happened at Eimco for notwithstanding all their professions it was very evident they were more influenced by fear than affection Nothing however was wanting to impress the chiefs with an opinion of Omai's consequence The drums trumpets bagpipes hautboys flutes violins and in short the whole band of music attended and took it by turns to play while dinner was getting ready and when the company were seated the whole band joined in full concert to the admiration of crowds of the inhabitants who were assembled round the house on this occasion The dinner consisted as usual of barbecued hogs fowls variously dressed some after  the manner of the country and others after the English manner with plenty of other provisions and wine and other liquors with which king Oreo made very free Dinner over heivas and fireworks succeeded and when night approached the multitudes that attended as spectators dispersed without the least disorder  We now received orders to prepare for our departure We had in this island procured more than hogs many of them large  Though it had been found in former voyages that most of those that were carried to sea alive refused to eat and consequently were soon killed yet we resolved to make one experiment more and by procuring large quantities of yams and other roots on which they were accustomed to feed on shore we ventured to take a few alive in each ship For this purpose our carpenters prepared styes for their reception in those parts where they might remain the coolest and while they were employed in that business the live stock that were still on shore were taken on board as were likewise every other article that remained  Nothing remarkable happened till the th when early in the morning we were surprized with an account that Omai's plantation was rooted up and destroyed his fences broken down and his horses and cattle set at large without being able to discover who were concerned in this malicious and deliberate act of premeditated mischief Capt Cook highly incensed offered considerable rewards for discovering and apprehending the offenders when it was found that the fellow who had had his head shaved and his ears cut off who had threatened to kill Omai was the principal and being a native of Ulietea an adjacent island had fled there for refuge but  Capt Cook offering six large axes for bringing him to justice and promising to stay seven days longer to give time to apprehend him some desperadoes undertook the task and on the fourth day brought him on board He was charged as the sole perpetrator but it was thought he must have had accomplices as he could not by himself in one night have plucked up so many trees destroyed so many plants and dug and defaced the ground in so many places where the European seeds had been sown However he refused to make any confession and when put in irons remained sullen  The preparations for our departure which this event had suspended recommenced and in the mean time to shew every attention possible to Omai the spare hands from both ships were sent ashore in order to restore his plantation to its former condition and to reinstate him in the quiet possession of it before the ships should sail At the same time Capt Cook ordered the following inscription to be cut upon the outside of his house  Georgius Tertius Rex Novembris  Naves  Resolution Jac Cook Pr  Discovery Car Clerke Pr  And to recommend him the better to the chiefs he was accompanied every day by Capt Cook and some of his officers who dined with him and invited king Oreo and the principal people of the island by turns to be of the party He also made entertainments for the young princesses and their brothers with music and dancing according to the English fashion and to please the public in general Capt Cook caused fireworks to be played off almost every other night for their diversion But notwithstanding all these  endeavours to reconcile Omai to his countrymen he could not help thinking himself the object of their envy rather than of their admiration They beheld him in the same light as the gentlemen in every country see lowborn citizens suddenly rising from indigence to wealth giving themselves airs and affecting state At the same time that they laugh at their folly they encourage their profusion and while they partake of their entertainments they take pleasure in mortifying their pride Such was the real case with Omai While he was feasting the chiefs and had nails to give to one red feathers to another glass and chinaware to a third and white shirts to the ladies Who but Omai but when they found he had expended most of what he had brought from abroad and had but just enough left by the bounty of his friends to buy him a plantation and to stock it the chiefs while they partook of his entertainments paid him little or no respect and had it not been for their deference to Capt Cook would probably have treated him amidst the splendor of his banquets with the utmost contemptSuch is the disposition of mankind throughout the world Men sprung from the dregs of the people must have something more than accidental riches to recommend them to the favour of their fellowcitizens they must have superior sense to direct their conduct and superior acquirements to render the virtues they possess conspicuous That this was not the case with Omai every day's experience furnished sufficient proofs Not many nights had passed after the waste made on his plantation before lights were seen about his house which it is supposed were intended to set it on fire had not the precipitancy of the centinel by firing his piece too suddenly given  the alarm and furnished the incendiaries with notice to make their escape The man too who had laid waste his plantation and who was in irons on board the Resolution the night before we intended to sail found means either to jump overboard or by some invisible assistance to unloose his chains and slip out of the ship He was to have been punished not by death but by a banishment worse than death He was to have been put on shore on some distant island from whence it would have been next to impossible he could ever have made his escape to molest Omai How he came to get from his confinement is not certainly known but the sentinel who was set to guard him was sentenced to be publicly whipped and to receive lashes every morning for fix mornings successively and a midshipman and mate who commanded the watch were sentenced the former to be expelled the ship to which he never more returned during the voyage the other to be turned before the mast but on submission was forgiven as was likewise the sentinel after suffering the first day's punishment As soon as the midshipman from the Resolution came on board the Discovery the third Lieutenant of the Discovery was ordered on board the Resolution  On the d of November being in readiness to sail Capt Cook took Omai aside and gave him lessons of instruction how to act At the same time directing him to send his boat over to Ulitea his native island to let him know how the Chiefs behaved to him in the absence of the ships If well he was to send by the messenger three white beads if they seized upon his stock or broke in upon his plantation three red beads or  if things remained just as we left them he was to send three spotted beads  In the morning of the d we unmoored and the wind being fair we made sail out of Hueheine road and when we were under way Omai came on board either to prevail on Capt Cook to let him return to England or to take his final leave never to see him more His parting was very affecting if tears could have prevailed on Capt Cook to let him return Omai's eyes were never dry and if the tenderest supplications of a dutiful son to an obdurate father could have made any impression Omai hung round his neck in all the seeming agony of a child trying to melt the heart of a reluctant parent He twined his arms round him with all the ardour of inviolable friendship till Capt Cook unable any longer to contain himself broke from him and retired to his cabin to indulge that natural sympathy which he could not resist leaving Omai to dry up his tears and compose himself on the quarterdeck  When he had vented his grief he returned and reasoned with Omai on the impropriety of his request reminded him of his anxieties while in England lest he should never more have been permitted to return home and now that he had been restored to his country and friends at an immense expence to his Royal Master it was childish to entertain a notion of being carried back Omai still renewed his tears he had wished he said to see his country and friends but having seen them he was contented and would never long for home again Capt Cook assured him of  best wishes but his instructions must be obeyed which were to leave him with his friends At parting he added six large axes to the presents he had before made him and some chisels and  Sheffield ware which he knew would be useful to him  Such was the parting of Omai from his beloved patron who had contracted a real friendship for him He said he should be the most miserable of all human beings when his protector was gone for that the inhabitants would be plotting his destruction and he should not have a happy moment while he had any thing left to live upon His two New Zealand boys were under little less concern to part from the ships than Omai himself They had already learned to speak English so as to be able to express their hopes and their fears They hoped to have gone along with the ships and they cried bitterly when they understood that they were to be left behind Thence arose a new seene between Omai and his boys that had not the officers on the quarterdeck interposed might have ended unfortunately for Omai They refused to quit the ship till they were compelled to it by force which was no easy matter the eldest now near sixteen being of an athletic make and of prodigious strength and the youngest about eleven being likewise a giant for his age were not easily managed They were both very tractable and obliging till they found they were to be left at Hueheine but then they grew desperate especially the youngest who was not easily subdued They discovered dispositions the very reverse of the islanders among whom they were destined to reside during the remainder of their lives and instead of a mean timid submission they shewed a manly determined resolution not to be subdued though overcome and ready if there had been a possbility to succeed to have made a second or even a third attempt to have regained their liberty We could never learn Capt Cook's  real reason for refusing to take on board some of those gallant youths from New Zealand who no doubt would have made useful hands in the high latitudes they were about to explore and would besides have exhibited living pictures of a people whose portraits have been imperfectly depicted even by our best draughtsmen There is a dauntless fierceness in the eyes and countenance of a New Zealand warrior that loses all its force under the feeble pencil of a fribbling artist It is now indeed too late to lament the nonimportation of a native from every climate where Nature had marked a visible distinction in the characters of person and mind As one in each climate might have been procured without force and when assembled together would have formed an academy for the study of the human frame that would have attracted the notice of artists from every country more than the celebrated statues of Greece and Rome  Omai's European weapons consisted of a musket bayonet and cartouchbox a fowlingpiece two pair of pistols and two or three swords or cutlasses With these and with his coat of mail he thought himsself invincible and it seemed that he had a project in his head to make war upon Bolabola in revenge for the injuries his father had received from the men of that country when they conquered Ulietea  Capt Cock's Remark    We shall now take our leave of Omai with just observing that Capt Cook having furnished him with the means of enriching his country and the adjacent isles with some of the most useful generae of fourfooted animals horses cows sheep and goats besides a breed of geese turkies and other domestic appendages that were strangers to the tropical islands he might with proper management rise superior to all the Earees in the  kingdoms round him had Nature given him talents to improve those advantages which chance had thrown in his way but even his patron was doubtful of his conduct and was anxious to the last to warn him how he proceeded  In the evening of the d of November the day we set out from Hueheine we arrived at Ulietea and were suddenly surrounded with boats laden with provisions Here as usual we landed our livestock carried the tents ashore and erected the astronomer's observatory One of our first exploits in this island was the act of a sentinel who was set to watch the sheep and the goats and who being insulted by some of the natives ran one of them through the body The deceased was instantly carried off by his companions and for a few nails was properly disposed of so that we never heard any thing more of his murder This happened  On the th when the grindsstone was stolen from the Discovery but the thief being detected and apprehended it was brought back the same day together with a large hog by way of ransom for the pilferer  On the th about two in the morning the sentinel at the observatory fell asleep and suffered his musket to be carried away He then took it into his head to leave his post and follow after it with a design however never more to return to the ships When this was known on board orders were immediately issued for securing the King and Royal family till the man should be taken and restored threatening at the same time to lay waste the country if he was suffered to escape It was some days before he was discovered and at length he was found at the distance of about ten miles sitting in a lone house surrounded  by Indians chiefly girls who had striped him of his clothes and disguised him in an Indian dress with his head curiously ornamental with feathers and his musket lying leaded by him He made no resistance Capt Cook himself having condescended to be his pursuer He was put in irons tried and sentenced to have lashes everyday for a week but being a brave soldier on submission was forgiven  On the d Mr M Midshipman and the Gunner's Mate made their escape in a canoe with two of their Otaheitean misses and landed on an adjoining island with a view to continue their course to Otaheite as soon as they had furnished themselves with provisions for the voyage They were no sooner missed and report made to Capt Cook than he ordered all the boats to be manned and a pursuit to commence with all possible expedition at the same time putting the King his two sons and his daughter  Po  under confinement till the fugitives should be taken and restored This he did no doubt to interest the people of the island in the pursuit and to prevent their assisting the deserters in making their escape He also promised a reward of large axes lookingglasses and other articles of considerable value to any of the natives who should be instrumental in apprehending and bringing them back To enforce his orders he caused all the canoes to be seized and he threatened destruction to the country if his men should be withheld He set the King at liberty to assist in the pursuit of the fugitives but threatened the young princes with slavery if they were not brought back within a certain time This might seem hard usage yet it had its effect and without this steady resolute proceeding the deserters would never have been  recovered Our own boats went day after day to all the adjoining islands without being able to learn the least trace of them and this they continued till having searched every island within the distance of two day's sail they were at length obliged to give over any farther search as fruitless  On the th after seven days absence some Indians came on board and acquainted Capt Cook that the fugitives were found and that in a few days they would be brought back This was a wellconcerted tale to put us off our guard whi  they had carried a deeplaid plot into executi  to seize Capt Clerke and Lieut Gore and to carry them off and confine them till the prisoners on board were released This was near being effected when it was discovered by a girl that one of the officers had been brought from  Hueheine  She hearing some of the Uliteans say that they would seize Capt Clerke and Mr Gore ran to acquaint the first of our people she met with what they intended for which she was threatened with death by the Uliteans for making the discovery It was therefore found necessary to conceal her till an opportunity offered to convey her to her friends Upon this information Capt Cook renewed his threatenings which he said he would instantly order to be carried into execution if the men were not delivered up  Next day the th about five in the evening a number of canoes were seen at a distance making towards the ships and as they approached nearer they were heard to sing and to rejoice as if they had succeeded in finding what they went in search of About six they came so high that we could discern with our glasses the deserters fastened together but without their misses They were no sooner brought on board than the royal prisoners  were released to the unspeakable joy of all but the two fugitives who were under great apprehensions for their lives Their punishment however was not so severe as might have been expected S was sentenced to receive lashes and M turned before the mast where he continued to do duty while there was little or nothing to do but on asking forgiveness was restored to his former station on the quarterdeck  It appeared that the Indians had traced them from island to island from Ulietea to Otaha from Otaha to Bolabola from Bolabola to the little island Taboo where they were found but where they never would have been looked for by us had not the Indians traced them out  On the st of December the tents were struck the live stock taken on board and we prepared to sailAn account of our intercourse with the Earees and Chiefs of the island would only be a tedious repetition of what had passed before in the other islands but one thing still remains to be told Amongst the visitors who occasionally came on board the Resolution was Ooroo the dethroned Monarch of Ulietea who resides at Hueheine a royal wanderer furnishing in his person an instance of the instability of power but what is more remarkable of the respect paid by these people to particular families especially to those who have once possessed the rights of sovereignty for they suffer Ooroo to preserve all the ensigns of royalty though he has lost his dominions Another instance of the like kind was Oree with whom Capt Cook was well acquainted when in he commanded the Endeavour Oree was the Chief of Hueheine but he now resides in Ulietea in a private station but still preserves his consequence  On the d notice was given to the Otaheitean misses that they must all prepare to depart that the ships were in readiness to leave the country never to return to the Society Islands any more This news caused great lamentation and much bustle and confusion They were now at a great distance from home and every one was eager to get what she could for herself before she could part from her beloved Most of them had already stript their mates of almost every thing they possessed and those who had still something in reserve led a sad life till they shared it with them But what is most astonishing notwithstanding what has been said of the constancy of these misses there were scarce a man who had to do with them without being injured by them When we took our departure from Ulietea we had scarce hands enough able to do duty on board there being more than under the Surgeon's hands In this situation those who were well were obliged to do duty for those who were hurt which to do them justice they very willingly performed  It was not however till the th that we could get the ships clear of these troublesome gentry In the mean time a messenger had arrived from Omai to Capt Cook according to his desire with a very satisfactory account that every thing went well with him except that his goat had died in kidding and requesting two more axes and another goat which were readily sent him  On the th we set sail with a brisk wind to the westward and Capt Cook having received advice that the King of Bolabola had part of a large anchor to dispose of we directed our course to that island where we arrived on the th Here both Captains landed and were introduced to the old King He received them according to the tropical  custom ordered mats to be spread for them and plaintains bananoes and cocoanuts to be brought by way of refreshment He then entered into discourse with them pressed them to bring their ships into harbour and treated them in every respect with great apparent kindness though he had been represented by Tupia to former voyagers as little better than a common robber Being told that they were in haste to sail and that they could not stay to come into harbour he entered upon business and after directing them to the place where the anchor lay he told them that one part of the purchase must be a ewe that he had a ram which had been presented to him by some strangers who had lately visited his island and who had left him a ewe but she was dead Capt Cook instantly ordered a ewe to be brought from the ship for which and four large axes he purchased the anchor weighing about pound weight Capt Cook makes no mention of the ewe but enlarges the quantity of the other purchase They then took leave and having brought the anchor on board both ships set sail steering N by F  The Island of Ulietea which we had just left has nothing in it that differs essentially from what is to be met with in the other islands only that the women have more liberty here than at Otaheite and are not restrained from eating in company with the men While here we were visited by the King and his Chiefs Gave and received entertainments We attended their plays and in return amused them with fireworks illuminations and other diversions in the same manner as at the other islands and remarked very little difference in the characteristics of the natives  As we were now taking our leave for ever of those fertile isles we added to our livestock more than hogs which we found would eat after they had recovered the seasickness In the former voyages it was not known that hogs would not eat while they were sick it was therefore thought prudent to kill them after fasting three or four days from a belief that having fasted so long they would never eat again and if they died of themselves none of the crew would eat carrion  On the th in the morning we were by observation in lat S and in long E and it may not be improper to observe that the spot on which the astronomer's tent was erected in the island of Hueheine was in lat S and in long E of Greenwich that at Mattavai Point long Ulietea long  PART II  Containing an Account of what happened in prosecuting the Voyage to the North to determine the Existence or Nonexistence of a Passage between the great Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in that Hemisphere  HAVING taken leave of the islands with which we were before acquainted in the southern hemisphere we now directed our course to the northward to explore coasts and countries hitherto unvisited by any English voyager and but lately known to the navigators of other countries  We took our departure from the Society Isles as has already been said on the th of December steering N by E as near as the winds would let us with mostly fine weather till the th when in lat S we were surrounded with land and sea weeds and bodies of trees which seemed to be but lately separated from their respective roots but it was not till  The d that we discovered land On that day in lat N long E after having crossed the line the day before the man at the masthead called out land bearing N E distance between six and seven leagues We instantly wore ship and stood in for a fine bay on which we found good anchorage in fathom water On viewing the island from the ships there did not appear the least sign of an inhabitant but near the shore there were shoals of sharks and the sea seemed crusted over with seafowls some of a very large size The boats that had been sent out to reconnoitre returned in the evening with one large turtle each and loaded with boobies and other tropical birds that by hungry mariners are generally esteemed good eating They likewise brought several sharks which they found in such crowds that they knocked them on the head with their oars  On the th we changed our station and anchored in fathom water  And on the th we kept Christmas in much mirth and festivity the crew having plenty of provisions and the Gentlemen plenty of turtle The ships being safely moored and the weather fine but almost insupportably hot the men were allowed the whole day to amuse themselves and every one had a pint of brandy to make merry and drink health to their friends in Old England  In the evening parties from both ships were invited to go a turtling but none were pressed into that service all were volunteers On our landing the crews went different ways and in order to know where to meet fires were made in separate directions one fire for the Resolution's party and one for that of the Discovery's Our party before morning had turned more than turtles and had carried them on board and when the boats were unloaded returned for more In the mean time a fishing party were likewise sent out and were no less successful than the turtlers hut on this service a seaman had a very narrow escape As he was helping to draw the seine a shark made a chop at his arm but fortunately caught only a piece of his shirt's sleeve with which he made off  The Resolution's turtlers had made a trip to their ship to unlade but on the return of their boats to the island one of their men was missing who tired with carrying a turtle of more than weight in the heat of the day had laid it down on the beech and retired to a thicket to shelter himself from the sun Here he fell asleep and as soon as he awoke be endeavoured to recover his turtle but in vain he had entangled himself among the bushes and in the evening after a most painful search he was found almost speechless through fatigue and want of refreshment  All this day our people continued their diversion on the S E side of the island but  On the th about ten in the morning Mr By Mr Er and Mr Pk with ten or twelve seamen in the cutter having a good quantity of water on board and each man a pint of brandy directed their course to the N E quarter and about noon arrived at a neck of land  over which they were to travel on foot to come at the place where the turtle were supposed to harbour and where it was dangerous to attempt to approach them by sea by reason of the surf Here they safely secured their cutter and near the shore they erected a kind of hut to which they carried their provisions and sat down to rest and to refresh This done they agreed to divide and to pursue their sport in separate parties Accordingly they set out and before the next morning they had sent in as many turtle as the cutter could well stow This they did by placing them across a couple of oars in the nature of a bier and keeping men employed in conveying them from the place where they were turned to the cutter As they grew tired of their diversion they repaired to the place of rendezvous but it was some surprize to the rest when at nine in the morning Mr By Mr Pk and Simeon Woodrooff the gunner's mate was missing It was then concluded that they had gone too far within land and that they had either lost their way or some accident had befallen them perhaps from natives lurking secretly in the woods though none had openly appeared  Under these apprehensions two seamen Bartholomew Loremer and Thomas Trecher were sent out in search of them each carrying a gallon of water with brandy and other refreshments in case they should meet with the Gentlemenn their way In a wild uncultivated country overrun with bushes and close cover the reader who has never been bewildered in a fullgrown thicket after sport can have no idea of men's being lost in the short space of a few miles So however it happened The Gentlemen invited by the mixed melody of the birds in the woods left these people as soon as they had properly stationed them  and entered an adjoining thicket with their guns The sport they met with led them on till night began to close upon them They were then at a distance from the turtlers and in the midst a trackless cover with nothing but lew trees to direct their return but what was more alarming the sun was no sooner set than a thick fog succeeded which involved the woods in darkness though the open beach remained clear In vain they attempted to regain the shore for instead of being able to discern the trees they had marked to secure their retreat they could hardly see one another at five yards distance In this situation they soon began to lose all knowledge of their way and lest instead of proceeding in the right course they should pursue a contrary direction they agreed to sit down to rest and for that purpose chose the first convenient spot that chance threw in their way Though their minds were troubled they had scarce set themselves down when sleep got the better of their anxiety and they all lay composed till attacked by swarms of black ants creatures more poisonous than bugs with which they were in a manner covered when they awoke and so disfigured and tormented with their bites and blisters that it is hardly possible to desribe their distress Thus circumstanced their first care was to clear themselves from these vermin by stripping themselves and sweeping them off with brushes made of the wings of the birds they had killed this done they clothed themselves again in order to renew their atttempts to recover the shore but all in vain The farther they walked as it appeared afterwards the farther they went astray At length suspecting their error they resolved to remain stationary and each man placing himself against an adjoining tree endeavoured  to console himself as well as he could till morning when the appearance of the sun should enable them to judge of the course they were to pursue but in a trackless wilderness how were they to make their way The thicket in many places was overgrown with thick grass and brambles reaching to their middles and in others so thick intersected with boughs and matted with leaves that it was hardly possible to keep company or to penetrate with their utmost efforts when these obstructions happened one hundred yards in as many minutes Still however labouring to advance they at length all at once observed an opening that led as they thought to the longwished for shore They forgot for the moment the pains of their lacerated limbs though all torn with briars and besmeared with blood and comforted themselves with the hope of a speedy deliverance But they had still a journey of about seven or eight miles to perform before they could reach the place from whence they set out Almost spent with fatigue and their spirits wasted with the most painful exertion of bodily strength without having a drop of water to quench their intolerable thirst they at length arrived at the hut when to their great mortification they found it deserted and destitute of every kind of refreshment In this situation casting their eyes towards the ships they perceived the boats hastening to their relief The officer who commanded and the crew had waited at the hut till all their provisions were expended and the officer not knowing how to proceed had repaired to the ship for a fresh supply and for fresh orders and was now returning fully furnished and instructed On his arrival he was struck with astonishment at the sight of three such miserable beings as the Gentlemen and Mate  appeared to be lacerated all over and besmeared with blood and with scarce a rag about them broader than a garter Their cry was for grog which was dealt to them sparingly and they were instantly sent on board to be properly taken care of  The first enquiry they made was whether any of the company had been sent after them and being answered in the affirmative and that they were not yet returned they could not help expressing their doubts whether they ever would return adding their wishes at the same time that no means might be omitted to endeavour their recovery  It is natural for men who have just experienced any signal deliverance to feel poignantly for the safety of others under the same critical circumstances It was therefore no small satisfaction to the sufferers when they were told that every possible means would be tried for the poor men's relief and to enable those who were to be sent on that errand the better to direct their search the gentlemen described as well as they could the spot where they thought they heard men halloo to one another about the dawn of day There were now twenty of the crew seamen and marines who had been dispatched from on board for recovering the gentlemen These had orders to traverse the thickets in a body till they should find one or other of them either living or dead for till the gentlemen appeared nothing could be concluded with certainty concerning them The majority were of opinion that if they had been alive they most certainly would have returned as soon as it was dark as they could have no motive to pursue their sport in the night and it was by no means probable that they should be bewildered because they might surely have found  the same way out of the cover by which they went into it This was very plausible but  on board who had sailed with Commodore Byron and who remembered the almost impenetrable thickets in the island of Tinian where men could not see one another in open day at the distance of five yards knew well how the gentlemen might be entangled and how hard it would fare with them if it should so happen But as this instance was known only to few it was regarded by none and the former opinion that some fatal accident had happened to them prevailed generally till the gentlemen appeared when the whole mystery was unravelled  Early in the morning of the next day the two men being still missing the whole party assembled and the plan of their proceeding was formed By marching in lines at such a distance from each other as to be within hearing it was thought impossible to fail of finding the men if living or of discovering some traces of them if dead and they were to direct their line of march towards the spot where the sound of the voices was heard by the gentlemen  After a diligent search of six hours Bartholomew Loreman was discovered in a most miserable condition almost blinded by the venomous bites of vermin added to the scorching heat of the sun and speechless for want of something to clear his throat He made signs for water and water was given him He had got out of the thicket and was wandering about upon the beech without being sensible of the miserable condition in which he was found It fortunately happened that a boat from the Discovery had been sent round the point of land already mentioned and stationed near where the turtlers had been employed the  night before for the purpose of taking the gentlemen on board in case they should have been strayed to any considerable distance If this precaution had not been taken this man must have perished before he could have been conveyed by any other means to the place of rendezvous and it was with the utmost difficulty that he was carried to the nearest boat As soon as he could be brought to his speech he said he had parted from his companion Trecher in the morning not in anger but not agreeing about the way back nor ever expecting to see one another again They had traversed the thicket as long as they were able in search of the gentlemen without success and when overcome with fatigue they sat down to refresh and he believed had drank a little too freely of the grog they had in charge for they both fell asleep They were frightened when they waked to find it dark night and although they felt their faces and hands covered with vermin the thoughts of having neglected their duty and the dread of the consequences so distracted their minds that they were hardly sensible of any other pain As rest was now no longer their object they rose and wandered they neither knew nor cared where till day began to break upon them In the mean time several wild projects came into their heads At last they thought of climbing the highest tree to try if they could discover any hill or eminence from whence they might take a view of the country in order to be certain whether it was inhabited or not This was approved of by both and Trecher mounted the loftiest within his reach from whence he said he could discern towards the Southwest a hill of considerable height and as that was as he thought the point that led to the  shore thither he proposed that they should go but Loreman rather chose to endeavour to regain the shore by another course and as he thought he heard the report of a gun the evening before he determined to make towards the point from whence the sound proceeded and in that he happened to judge right and when he got out of the wood being parched with thirst he killed a turtle and sucked the blood His companion he said who was at some distance farther in the thicket and who did not hear the report of the gun did not believe what he said whereupon they agreed to part What course Trecher took he could not tell but he believed to the Southwest  Loreman was judged in too dangerous a condition to admit of any delay he was therefore sent off in the boat and being put under the care of the Surgeon soon recovered  After this detail it was debated whether to resign Trecher to his fate or to continue the search The humanity of the officer who had the command of the party prevailed It was now about ten in the morning of the th when the whole party after taking some refreshment set out to scour the thickets and by hallooing ringing of bells beating of drums and pursuing different courses determined he should hear them if he were alive It was no easy task to penetrate a trackless cover overgrown with underwood and abounding with infects of which the musquitoes were the least troublesome But numbers make that easy which to individuals would be impracticable They went on chearfully at first but before a few hours were elapsed even the gentlemen who were inspirited by their success in killing game began to be tired and it was thought adviseable to rest and refresh  during the middle of the day and to renew the pursuit after they had dined As yet they had not been able to discover any trace or track of the man they were seeking though it had been agreed between Trecher and his companion to cut boughs from the trees as they passed along by way of mark or guide to each other in case of separation  This was no small discouragement and few had any relish to renew a labour attended with so much fatigue and so little prospect of success  The officers were alone inflexibly bent on the pursuit The men though they were no less willing were not all equally able to endure the fatigue and some of them were even ready to drop before their dinner and their grog had revived their spirits The only expedient that now remained to be tried was that which Trecher himself had projected namely to climb the highest tree that appeared in view in order to look for the hill which he pretended to have seen and to which it was thought probable that he might direct his course This was no sooner proposed than executed In a moment a sailor was perched at the top of every lofty tree in sight and the high land descried seemingly at no great distance from the place where the party had dined It was now agreed to make the best of their way to the eminence but this proved not so easy a task as it at first appeared to be When they thought themselves just ready to mount they met with a lagoon that interrupted their progress and coasting it along they discovered the skeleton of a creature that by its length appeared to be an allegator In viewing this narrowly something like the track of some large animal was observed to have passed it and the high grass  on the margin of the lagoon to have been fresh trodden This excited the curiosity of the whole party who imagined that some monster inhabited the lagoon against which it was prudent for them to be upon their guard The waters of the lagoon were salt as brine and every where skirted with a kind of reed and sedge that reached as high as a man's head and could not be penetrated without danger from scorpions or other venomous reptiles several of which had been seen in the bushes All attempts therefore of succeeding by this course appeared to be labour lost and as no other were thought more probable it was resolved to relinquish the pursuit and to return to the boats but the day being already too far spent to make their return practicable before the morning it was agreed to coast it along the lake to endeavour to find access to the opposite hills and this was the more easily effected as between the sedgey border and the thicket there was an open space of unequal breadth only sometimes intersected with brambley patches that joined the lake but of no great extent Through these they made their way with little opposition till the lake appeared to deepen when a most stubborn woody copse seemed to bid defiance to their further progress This difficulty however was with much labour surmounted and it was no sooner passed than the lake was found to terminate and the ground to rise The country began now to put on a new face The prospect which had hitherto presented nothing but a wild and almost impenetrable thicket as they ascended the rising ground became delightful And when they had attained the summit of the eminence was exceedingly picturesque Here they determined to pass the night within a pleasant  grove which seemed to be designed by nature for a place of rest The whole party now assembled and orders were given by the commanding officers to erect temporary huts to shelter them from the evening damps These huts were only boughs and leaves of trees set up tent fashion In this service some were employed in cutting down and preparing the materials while others were busied in dispossing and putting them together some were ordered to collect fuel and others to carry it to the summit of an adjoining hill in order to be kindled at the close of day and kept burning during the night by way of signal to let the man know if alive where to repair and the ships that the party were safe Before night set in the huts were completed the fire was lighted the sentinel at his station the watch set and the party all retired to rest when about the dead of night the sentinel who attended the fire was surprized by a fourfooted monster This monster upon examination proved no other than the identical Thomas Trecher of whom they had been in search so long crawling upon all sours for his feet were so blistered that he could not stand and his throat so parched that he could not speak It is hard to say which was predominant their joy their surprize or their laughter No time however was lost in administering comfort to the poor man He was a most affecting spectacle blistered from head to foot by poisonous insects whose venomous stings had caused such an intolerable itching that his very blood was inflamed by constant rubbing By anointing him with oil the acrimony in some degree abated and by frequently giving him small quantities of tea mixed with a little brandy they brought him to his speech but it was some  days before he recovered the perfect use of his faculties  The absence the whole night of the party sent out in search of him having been reported to Capt Cook he had ordered two boats into the lagoon to go different ways to assist in the search but being in the evening relieved from his anxiety he recalled the boats and gave orders to prepare for sailing  We had now been off this island near days in which time we had taken more than turtle from to lb weight on board But tho' it seemed more than leagues in circumference there were not the smallest traces of any human being having ever been upon it before and indeed should any people be so unfortunate as to be accidentally driven upon it they could not possibly exist for any length of time There are it is true many birds and abundance of fish but no visible means of allaying thirst nor any vegetable that could supply the place of bread On the few cocoatrees upon the island the number of which did not exceed thirty very little fruit was found and in general what was found was either not fully grown or had the juice salt or brackish so that a ship touching here must expect nothing but fish and turtle but not a drop of fresh water was to be found throughout the island  On the st of January about ten in the morning we unmoored and set sail with the Resolution in company directing our course N by E with a gentle breeze from the East  To the island which we had just left Capt Cook gave the name of Christmas Island leaving in it a bottle with a similar inscription to that cut on Omai's house the date only excepted It lies  in lat N and in long E from Greenwich It is a low barren island and has all the appearance of having been blighted The few cocoanut trees that were found upon it produced hardly any fruit and except a few on the borders of the lagoon already mentioned what they bore were without kernels  Early on the d of January Christmas Island bore S S E as far as the eye could carry and as we were now clear of land and proceeding with a prosperous gale and had plenty of provisions on board the men were allowed turtle to boil with their pork which however in a few days was discontinued by the advice of the Surgeon and turtle substituted in the room of every other kind of meat This was found both healthful and nourishing and was continued till within a few days of our arrival at another island where we met with fresh provisions and water equal to any we brought with us from the Society Isles  On the d the wind shifted W S W and a storm came on preceded by a louring darkness that presaged some violent convulsion and soon after it broke forth in thunder lightning wind and rain which in two hours increased to such a violent degree as no man on board had ever known the like Fortunately for us its violence in a few hours abated but in that little time the sea broke over our quarter and cleared the decks of every thing that was loose Before noon the wind subsided but the rain continued till evening of which we made good use From the time of our leaving Ulietea to the present day we had received no fresh supply of water and though the still had been constantly at work our complement began already to run scanty This afternoon several indications of land were observed  such as great quantities of seaweed floating about the ships and fresh timber driving with the current The Resolution made the signal to shorten sail and stand to the Southward which was obeyed but no land coming in sight while it was daylight after eight hours search we left off the pursuit and resumed our course to the Northward which we continued till  The th when in lat long we steered to the N W in search of land the signs of which were very striking but after continuing that course all night without succeeding we again stood to the North From this time till  The th nothing material happened some slight storms excepted we shall therefore  me our relation of what occurred to Trecher from the time that he parted from his companion on the th of December till the night he was found on the d  It was as has already been observed several days before he could perfectly recollect all that passed in his mind and all that he suffered in his person He confirmed Loreman's relation of what passed while they remained together but in the morning of the th when they agreed to part his thoughts ran chiefly on discovering some house or place of resort of the natives as it ran strongly in his mind that an island of such extent as that appeared to be could not be wholly destitute of inhabitants In pursuit of this idea he determined to make towards the hill or high land which he had seen from the top of the tree and to observe the course of the sun for his guide but he met with many obstructions that retarded his progress The reeds and the rough grass were in many places so high and thick that he was almost  suffocated in attempting to get through them and was frequently obliged to return when he thought he had nearly reached the opposite side Though there were serpents and he believed scorpions continually bissing in almost all directions the fear of being stung by them was absorbed by the more immediate torture he felt from the musquitoes and other venomous insects that fastened upon him and teized him incessantly add to these distresses the bad condition of his shoes which were worn to shreds and though he tied them round and round with cords made of twisted grass yet it was hardly possible for him to keep them upon his feet for ten steps together In this melancholy situation rest was a stranger to him yet sleep would sometimes close his eyes and fill his imagination with horrors still more distressing than those he felt while awake Towards the evening of the th he thought he heard the howling of dogs and awhile after the growling of some savage beast but of what species he could not tell however he saw nothing and these might only be the creatures of his own disturbed fancy Towards night he got together a quantity of broad leaves from the trees to make him a bed and to cover his face and hands from the black ants To allay his thirst he thought of chewing the stems of a reed that had a saccharine taste and was probably a wild kind of sugarcane which gave him some refreshment and contributed not a little to his preservation Soon as day began to dawn he found himself weak and languid and had very little stomach to renew his labour His first care however was to repair his shoes This he did by forming wisps of grass into the shape of soals and placing them underneath the remains of the leather  soals He then tied them together round his feet and ankles with cords made as before and with these he made shift to scramble on awhile but they soon wanted repair He again had recourse to his first expedient and mounted a tree that overtopped the cover and got sight of the high land that first animated his pursuit He thought it so near that he could soon reach it and hastening down made his way with more alacrity than ever being prepossessed that if he reached that eminence his deliverance would be certain For some hours he struggled through the most formidable obstacles the cover being now so thick and strong and withal so high that he could hardly see the light over his head through the leaves and the bushes This happened to be the outer border that skirted the lagoon which when he had penetrated and found an opening his heart leaped within him but his joy was or short duration He presently discovered that he had another difficulty to furmount before he could reach the summit of his wishes He attempted the lagoon and waded nearly across without the water rising higher than his middle but all at once plunged overhead in deep water and it was next to a miracle that he saved himself from drowning He then returned quite exhausted and dejected and breaking through the sedge of the margin of the lake he stumbled upon the skeleton of the monster already mentioned which he believed was fifty feet long He was so scared at the fight of the bones that his hair stood onend and he thought of nothing now but being eaten up alive Totally dispirited and faint for want of food or any thing to drink and deprived of all means of proceeding any farther he crept along the lake till he came to a  cocoanut tree near the edge of the thicket which he attempted to climb but fell down for want of strength to keep his hold and lay for several hours incapable of motion He heard he said a noise in the cover in the day but could neither halloo to be heard nor follow the sound though some of the company must have passed very near him but seeing the fire lighted on the hill in the evening it encouraged him to make one struggle more for life Without a shoe to his foot having lost them in the lake he made shift to crawl up the hill as already related Few readers will think it possible for a man to suffer so much in so short a time and yet many have lost their lives by being bewildered in England and many more on the wild heaths in Scotland which cannot be supposed to be so dangerous as the thick cover of a desolate island where no man ever set his foot before But be that as it may such is the account given by Trecher of his sufferings during the three days he was absent from the ship  Having now been days at sea without seeing land  On the th a very severe storm arose which blew with irrestible fury for some hours and obliged us to clue up our main sheets and scud bofore it at the rate of seven or eight knots an hour but before noon the wind died away and a dead calm succeeded Such is the variableness of the weather near the tropics  On the th being then in lat N and long E the man at the masthead called out High land bearing E N E and in a very little time came in sight of more land apparently of an equal height with the former As we approached the windward island it presented no very promising aspect being mountainous and  surrounded with reefs without any signs of inhabitants we therefore stood off and on till  The th when we bore away for the land to leeward but not then in sight  About nine in the morning it was seen the second time at the distance of about seven or eight leagues We were charmed with its appearance as we came near it observing it to abound with rivers and to exhibit a prospect so full of plenty that we anticipated the pleasure we expected by supposing ourselves already in possession of a most seasonable supply We had been for several days reduced to the scanty allowance of a quart of water aday and that none of the best and now that we saw or thought we saw whole rivers before us our hearts were dilated with joy yet we had still much to suffer We found ourselves debarred from the thing we were most in want of for several days by shoals and rocks that to us were impracticable We coasted along the N W side of the island sounding as we went while the boats from both ships were employed in searching for some bay or harbour where we might safely anchor In the mean time several canoes came from the shore with plantains and dried fish on board who parted with what they had for any trifles that were offered them and at first behaved with great civility but could not be persuaded to venture on board At five in the evening we were two leagues from the shore surrounded by Indians in their canoes with hogs in abundance some very large which we purchased according to their size for a spike or a tenpenny nail each  While we remained at sea no people on earth could be more friendly but our boats had no sooner landed than a quarrel arose between the  natives and our people which was terminated by the death of one of the former It was said that the Indians were the aggressors by throwing stones at the boats to prevent the people from landing and that orders being given to fire a gun over the heads of the assailants without doing them any hur tinstead of commanding respect it only encouraged them in insolence till Mr W our third Lieutenant presenting his piece shot one of the ringleaders dead upon the spot  This early act of severity was probably the means of saving many lives The Indians dispersed immediately carrying off the dead body with them And the boats not having made any discovery returned to the ships where they were taken on board and secured till next morning  On the st the boats were again sent out but to as little purpose as before Little trade was this day carried on as the natives seemed very shy But  On the d the ships having found anchorage on the southwest side they were no sooner moored than they were again surrounded with a more numerous multitude of islanders than before who seemed to express the greatest astonishment at the greatness of our ships nor did it appear that they had ever seen an European ship before though they were not wholly unacquainted with the use of iron Most of their canoes were laden with hogs plantains bananoes and sweet potatoes which they readily exchanged chiefly for iron Here the sailors were suffered to make what purchases they pleased only women were prohibited by Capt Cook's order on the severest penaltiesThis caution which was undoubtedly dictated by humanity to prevent the introduction of a loathsome disease among an innocent people  created a general murmur among the seamen whose pleasure was centered in that kind of commerce in the new discovered islands wherever they went  In the afternoon the pinnace was ordered out and the two Captains landed on the beach where they were met by the Chiefs of the island and more than of their subjects not in a hostile manner but in amity exchanging presents and establishing trade  Capt Cook made signs for water and was conducted to a most delightful pool so conveniently situated for supplying the ships that had not the Resolution been driven from her moorings by the violence of an easterly wind and strong current nothing could have exceeded our entertainment at this hospitable port We met with no obstruction in watering These people merited our best commendations in their commercial intercourse never once attempting to cheat us either ashore or alongside the ships Some of them indeed at first betrayed a thievish disposition or rather they thought that they had a right to every thing they could lay their hands on but we soon convinced them that this conduct was not to be suffered with impunity One of our visitors in the course of trade offered some fishhooks to sell He was observed to have a small parcel tied to the string of one of them which he separated with great care and reserved for himself Being asked what it was he pointed to his belly and spoke something which we could not understand at the same time saying it was bad as if he did not wish to answer any more questions about it On seeing him so anxious to conceal the contents he was requested to open it which he did with great reluctance They found that it contained a thin  depiction of the people of the Sandwich Islands  A Man and Woman of Sandwich Islands  p  bit of flesh which to appearance had been dried but was now wet with salt water It struck us that it might be human flesh and the question being put to him he answered that the flesh was part of a man Another of his countrymen who stood by was then asked whether it was their custom to eat those killed in battle and he immediately answered in the affirmative Other proofs were not wanting to confirm this abominable practice and also that they like the Otaheiteans offered up human sacrifices We found indeed upon further acquaintance such a similarity of language manners customs religious rites and in short propensities of disposition as left us no room to doubt of their once having been one and the same people When the Resolution was forced to sea she had but half her complement of water nor had she fresh provisions sufficient to supply her people for any length of time We in the Discovery were more fortunate In the evening of the th we could see the Resolution to leeward eight or nine leagues and in the mean time while she was beating up we were employed in compleating our hold  On the th one of their great men paid a visit to Capt Clerke He came off in a double canoe and like the King of the Friendly Islands paid no regard to the small canoes that lay in her way but run against them or over them without endeavouring in the least to avoid them His attendants helped him into the ship and placed him on the gangway where they stood round him holding each other by the hands nor would suffer any one to come near him but Capt Clerke himself He was a young man clothed from head to foot and accompanied by a young woman supposed to be his wife His name was said  to be Tamahano Capt Clerke made him some suitable presents and received from him in return a large bowl supported by two figures of men the carving of which both as to design and execution shewed some degree of skill He could not be prevailed upon to go below but after staying some time in the ship he was carried again to his canoe and returned to the island The next day several messages were received by Capt Clerke inviting him to return the visit and acquainting him that the Chief had provided a large present on that occasion but being anxious to get to sea and join the Resolution the Captain did not think it adviseable to accept the invitation This was the only Chief of note seen upon this island  On the th we were in readiness to fail and having lost sight of the Resolution we imagined that not being able to fetch her former station she had bore away to another island which had been seen to the N W distance about or leagues  On the th we weighed directing our course to the N W but about ten in the morning the man at the masthead descried the Resolution at a great distance bearing S by W whereupon we instantly tacked and stood S by E to join our Commodore This being effected we remained several days beating up but in vain to regain our former birth  On the th we bore away to another lee island named Oneeheow which abounded with hogs and fruit and where the natives were equally hospitable with those we had just left and brought from the shore every kind of provision their country produced but there being no water to be procured at a moderate distance and the reefs being dangerous and the surf running high Capt  depiction of the people of the Sandwich Islands  A Man of the Sandwich Islands in a Mask  page  Cook after surveying the island and taking possession of it in the name of his Royal Master calling the whole cluster Sandwich's Isles was preparing to depart when a storm came on from the eastward and again obliged the Resolution to put to sea  The Captain had already exchanged several presents with the Chiefs of the island and had in particular presented a Chief with two shegoats and a ram and had received in return six large hogs with a quantity of salt an article which began to be much wanted He had likewise purchased all such necessaries for the ship's use as the inhabitants could supply and it was fortunate that he had so done before the storm came on for afterwards it would have been equally impossible for him to have recovered his station here as he had found it to regain his former birth in the other harbour Our boats while the shore was accessible were diligent in bringing on board the product of the island so that on the evening of  The st of February we had more than hogs on board with salt in abundance besides three months allowance of sweet potatoes bananoes plantains sugarcane and other provisions  Early in the morning on the d we weighed and soon came in sight of the Resolution and both ships left the island to pursue the voyage  These islands which lie between the latitude of and N and long and E are not in beauty and fertility much inferior to the Friendly Islands in the southern hemisphere nor are the inhabitants less ingenious or civilized It is not a little astonishing therefore that they should remain so long unknown to the Spaniards as they lie as it were in the midway between Manilla and the Western Coasts of New  Spain and will now probably be their rendezvous for refreshments Except the first quarrel that happened of which we have already spoken we had not the least difference with any of the natives during our stay What they had to dispose of they parted with upon the easiest terms nor did they seem quite so thievishly inclined as those on the other side the line  Every island in this group of which there are more than we could count appeared to be well peopled In that which we first visited called by the natives Ottooi it was no uncommon thing to see between two and three thousand of the natives assemble on the beech when any thing was to be shewn that excited their curiosity And there we learned the names of four other islands viz Woahoo Oneeheow Oreehowe and Tahoora the last inhabited by birds of which there were as we were told incredible numbers  The men in these islands are of the middle size of a dark complexion not much tattowed but of a lively open countenance They were no otherwise clothed than decency required and what they had on appeared to be their own manufacture of which there were various fabricks and of a variety of colours Some were made with borders exactly resembling coverlets and others appeared like printed cottons and besides cloth they had many other articles which shewed that they had artificers among them not wanting in ingenuity One peculiarity we observed among the men and that was in the cut of their hair which they trimmed up to a ridge along their heads in form like what in horses manes is called hogging Others again wore it long plaiting it in tails which hung below the waist and these we took for marks of distinction among them Add to  this a kind of cap and short cloak worn by their Chiefs in shape like those worn by the Ladies in England and composed of feathers of different colours ranged in rows one over another and narrowing from the lower border till they terminated in a kind of network round the neck The brilliant colours of the feathers in those that happened to be new added not a little to their fine appearance and we found that they were in great estimation with their owners for they would not at first part with one of them for any thing that we offered asking no less for each than a musket However some were afterwards purchased for very large nails The best sort was certainly scarce and it should seem were only used at their theatrical exhibitions or other solemnities The cap is made like a helmet and sits very close having notches to admit the ears It is a frame of twigs and osiers covered with a network into which are wrought feathers in the same manner as in the cloaks These with the cloaks probably compleat the theatrical dress  The women in general had shock hair which they were at great pains to ornament They had large holes in their ears that filled as they were with most beautifully coloured shells made up in clusters served for jewels and had no bad effect Their headdress consisted of wreaths of flowers decorated with feathers chiefly red and having in general lively piercing black eyes white teeth small features and round faces were not a little inviting had not Chpt Cook's severe prohibition put a check to the predominant passion of our men  Their dress upon the whole was more decent than that of the men and few were without necklaces and bracelets of which they seemed very fond and for which our strings of beads were well  suited To their necklaces were sometimes seen small human figures of bone hung pendant  Their language differed but little from that of every other people we had lately visited and we soon learnt to converse so as to make ourselves understood  Their manufactures the people freely sold for nails hatchets scissars knives or iron instruments of any kind glass bowls was a valuable article so were beads buttons lookingglasses chinacups and in short any of our European commodities  Their weapons of war consistedOf spears twelve feet long curiously polished and tapered about an inch and half in diameter at top and shod with bearded bone about a foot in length at the lower endOf daggers of a particular make with which they could stab with both endsOf bows and arrows which seemed rather calculated for diversion for boys than for killing enemies their arrows being a slender reed only about half a yard long shod with woodOf small battleaxes most ingeniously fabricated of stone and wood and neatly wrought as were their implements of every kindOf saws made of sharks teeth with which they cut up the dead bodies they prepare for meatAnd of slings with which they threw stones with great force to a great distance but with no certain aim  Their canoes were long and narrow not more than two feet wide in the middle from whence they tapered to both ends They were strengthened by cross bars which served both for feats and stretchers and had small outriggers to prevent oversetting  That they had some knowledge of iron before we landed among them is certain but how they  came by it is not clearly to be accounted for the most probable conjecture is that it must have been drifted to their coast from some wrecks and that opinion is strengthened by part of an iron hoop being the only precious remains of that metal that was seen among them which was purchased by Lieut King But from this small specimen how to learn the use of it which they certainly did by their eagerness to purchase it This remains to be accounted for  Except the sugarcane which appeared indigenous to these islands and which were rare in those on the other side the line their produce was much the same with that of the Friendly Isles only the cocoanuts were by no means so large nor in such great plenty here as at the Friendly Isles  Wood was not to be purchased in plenty nor did we stand much in need of that article  Hogs dogs ducks and poultry were here in greater abundance than on the other side the line but their plantations were not so beautifully ranged nor so well cultivated The houses here are warmer as the air is colder They are built tentfashion and are covered from top to bottom Their food consists of the fruits of the earth and of animal food of which there was great plenty if dogs made a part of it nor was there any want of fish nor of instruments to catch them  There seems indeed a remarkable conformity between these islands and those of the opposite hemisphere not only in their situations but in their number and in their manners customs religious ceremonies arts and manufactures of the inhabitants though it can scarce be imagined that as the globe is now constituted they could ever have any communication being at more than  miles distance one from the other with very little if any dry land between One custom remarkable they seem to have in common with the New Zealanders and that is pulling out one of their teeth  From observing this general conformity among the tropical islanders some have been led to believe that the whole middle region of the earth was once one entire continent and that what is now the Great South Pacific Ocean was in the beginning the Paradise of the World but whoever would wish to hear more on this subject will do well to read Burnet's Theory of the Earth where if they do not find arguments solid enough to convince their reason they will meet with reasons sufficiently plausible to amuse their fancy But we must now take leave of these islands tho' we shall have occasion to mention them again with less commendation  Capt Cook the short time he remained at Atooi visited the morais on the island which formerly had been most magnificent structures but were now much in decay but still preserved all the appearances of human sacrifices of which there is not a doubt any more than of their eating the flesh of their enemies which they call savoury meat  On the d of February the day after we took our departure we had heavy squalls but not so violent as to force us to part company  On the th it cleared up and we pursued our course E N E having pleasant weather and a favouring gale  On the th our men had pickled pork served instead of their ordinary allowance one pound  per  man aday with a pound and a half of yams instead of bread and this was continued to them  for seven weeks which they liked much better than their ship's provisions  Nothing material occurred till  The th when there appeared the usual signs of land but we saw none and continued our course till  The th when we tacked and stood N N W lat long E But  On the th we stood again N by E with a light breeze During this interval of fine weather our sailmakers were employed in getting up and reviewing the sails when it was found that they were in a miserable condition being eaten through by the rats in a hundred places While they were employed in repairing them our other artificers had work enough to do for it was made a point to suffer none to remain idle when the business of navigating the ship did not require their immediate attendance The course we were now steering we continued with little or no variation except what was occasioned by the shifting of the winds till the st when in lat long E we shorttened sail and steered N N W the whole night having had strong signs of land to the Eastward the whole day but no land coming in sight we again renewed our course and so continued till  The th when a most dreadful storm arose with such a swell that though we were not more than half a mile from the Resolution we frequently lost sight of her amidst the heavy seas In this gale both ships suffered considerably in their sails and rigging it being impossible to hand them before we were surprised by the tempest We were now in lat and in long and were attended by seals sealions manofwar birds Port Egmont hens shags and seagulls which were strong indications of land  On the morning of the th the wind abated but the swell still continued from the Southward and we proceeded under close reefed topsails til about ten in the morning when we shook out the reefs and made all the sail we could in company with the Resolution  March the st the wind died away and being in lat and long E we sounded with fathom but found no bottom We now began to feel the effects of an alteration in the climate From intense heat it became piercing cold and our men who despised their  Magellan  jackets while within the temperate climates now first began to find the comfort of them in these Northern regions  On the morning of the d some parts of the sea seemed covered with a kind of slime and myriads of small sea animals were seen swimming about which they did with equal ease upon their backs sides or bellies and as they varied their position with respect to the light they emitted the brightest colours of the most precious gems Sometimes they appeared quite pellucid at other times assuming various tints of blue from a pale sappharine to a deep violet colour which were frequently mixed with a ruby or opaline redness and glowed with a strength sufficient to illuminate the vessel and water these colours appeared most vivid when the glass into which these animalcula were placed was held to a strong light but had only a brownish cast when the animals had subsided to the bottom With candlelight the colour was chiefly a beautiful pale green and in the dark they had a faint appearance of glowing fire Mr Anderson supposed them a new species of animalcula which have a share in producing that  lucid appearance often observed near ships at sea in the night  On the th being moderate weather we sounded and at fathoms found bottom loamy sand and shells At six in the evening we shortened sail and stood all night S one half W with the water as white as milk  On the th both ships wore and stood N by E shortening sail in the evening and standing all night to the Southward  On the th we made the land Cape Blanco the Westernmost known point of California bearing E N E then distant about or leagues It appeared mountainous and covered with snow This day the gentlemen in the gunroom dined on a fricassee of rats which they accounted a venison feast and it was a high treat to the sailors whenever they could be lucky enough to catch a number sufficient to make a meal  On the th we wore ship and stood N E by E lat long E We had heavy squalls with snow and rain We continued working off land making little or no way to windward In the evening we close reefed our topsails and within half an hour could not shew an inch of sail except fore and mizen staysails The storm continued all night and part of the next day without the least abatement  Early in the morning of the th saw the Resolution to windward and at eight came in sight of Cape Blanco bearing N by W distant about three leagues At ten tacked ship and stood off land both ships in company lat long E  On the th both ships stood again for the land which we could see at a great distance At six in the evening the land being distant about a  league we wore ship and stood off all night Lost sight of the Resolution lat long  On the th she answered our signals and we were soon in company but the sea running mountains high and the wind increasing a strong gale we stood N by E the wind at E by N and about two in the afternoon the Cape bore N E by E distant about six leagues Here the wind being somewhat abated and the sea having changed its colour we sounded at fathom but no bottom Both ships stood again W S W all night with little wind but great swells from the Eastward lat long  On the th light winds which continued all the morning with snow and sleet At two in the afternoon both ships stood S by W with a stiff breeze At six wore ship

with rain About four split the main topsail At six close reefed the topsails and stood all night N N E with heavy  rains and a strong gale Till this day the yams on board our ship lasted but now bread was delivered out to the ship's company in their stead at twothirds allowance All well and in perfect health notwithstanding the severe service Lat long  On the th it cleared up and the wind being moderate we made sail N ½ E the wind at W S W At ten in the morning finding the water to change colour we sounded at fathom and looking ahead saw a large reef not above two cables length before us We fired a gun as signal to the Resolution and had just time and room to escape the danger Had it been night in two minutes we must all have perished We tacked and stood to the Southward till the morning of  The th when we came in sight of land bearing N E by E distance eight or nine leagues high and whited over with snow The weather was this day so altered that the gentlemen who delighted in the sport diverted themselves in the boats with shooting ducks shags sealarks and gulls and next morning  The th we continued to steer along shore the land not more than three miles distant saw no inhabitants but very large trees and bleak mountains covered with snow About twelve at noon we hauled upon a wind and stood W by N wind S W by S As we found the coast rugged with high rocks above water we suspected other rocks below We therefore kept at a convenient distance from the land and opened upon several fine inlets and close harbours but no entrance for ships of burden Lat long  On the th made sail early in the morning and stood N N E coasting it along shore the  land high and mountainous We heard howlings of wild beasts but saw none The shores were covered with seafowl and the skirts of the woods with land birds of various kinds  On the th the weather still continuing fine we pursued our course N N E with light winds from the S E till two in the afternoon when the clouds began to darken and the rain pour down in torrents At five it blew a stiff gale and at night a fog arose when we soon lost sight of the Resolution At ten it blew a hurricane We close reefed our topsails lowered our topgallant yards and stood W S W wind S firing guns and hoisting lights as signals to the Resolution but not being answered we lay to till morning with the ship's head to the South lat long  On the st as soon as it was daylight we saw the Resolution bearing N N W distant about four miles We made sail and soon came up with her the wind abating we pursued our course N onehalf W and before noon lost sight of land as it trended to the East About four in the afternoon the weather altered and a heavy snow came on which soon filled the decks the flakes being such as no man on board had ever seen before and as broad as a small saucer Before it was dark it turned to rain and so continued with gusts of wind during the night  On the d we came again in sight of land bearing N by E distant about five or six leagues covered with snow and abounding with trees of an immense height as we neared it we observed several smokes far up the country but before we reached the shore a sudden storm came on more violent than any we had yet met with on this tempestuous coast Before we had time to hand  the sails it split the jib carred away the stay and shivered the main topmast staysails to fritters As night approached we furled the courses and lay too under bare poles  On the d in the morning the wind abated and the weather cleared up We made sail to the Southward but before dark it again began to blow with heavy rain We stood all night with the ship's head S onehalf W with starboard tacks on board No observation  On the th we tacked ship and stood N N E the wind at N W by N a steady breeze we shook out our reefs and made sail Such and so variable was the weather on Drake's New Albion coast From a hard gale which increased to a hurricane not being able to shew an inch of sail for several hours the sea running to a tremendous height the ship rolling till the yardarms almost reached the water it all at once cleared up moderate and fine gales took place and so continued the whole day We were now by observation in lat long As night approached the clouds began to lour and to threaten another storm but except some snow and hail which fell in the night nothing remarkable happened till  The th when a thick fog arose and we lost sight of the Resolution but before night we were again in company About six in the evening it came on to blow hard with heavy showers we wore ship and stood to the Southward the rain continuing the whole night  On the th at five in the morning we had a heavy fall of snow which lasted four hours with piercing winds the whole day About ten we bore away and stood N N W the wind at N E In the evening we tacked ship and  stood to the Southward We were now in lat long  On the th at six in the morning stood W by N with a stiff breeze At ten it became very heavy and dark We stood N by E the wind shifted to E by N and a calm succeeded But about six in the evening the wind freshened and before we could hand the canvas split the foretopsail  Early on the th it blowing very hard we closereefed our topsails and stood N N E the wind at E This day we saw three men of war birds two Port Egmont hens several seals and sealions with some whales Lat long  On the th at two in the morning it still continued to blow very hard We tacked and stood S S W till seven in the morning when the weather cleared up and the wind rather abated We shook out our reefs and made sail N by E with a light breeze from E by N At ten the man at the masthead saw land bearing from E S E to W N W distance five or six leagues At half after one P M we bore away N E by E for a bay which we thought we saw to the Eastward As we approached it we observed several smokes and fires a considerable way within land At length after a series of the most tempestuous weather that any ships ever experienced for so long a time we discovered an inlet the mouth of which was not more than two miles over in which we entered and found it a sound which narrowed as we advanced though it still continued of a considerable depth About seven in the evening we anchored in ninetyseven fathom water and was presently joined by the Resolution We made signs for  some of the natives to come on board but this they declined though some hundreds soon came about the ships to which they appeared to be no strangers as they give us to understand that iron was what they valued most We observed likewise that their weapons were headed with copper and their arrows with iron which they could obtain only from the Russians or from trade with the Hudson's Bay Company Though they declined coming on board they were nevertheless very civil and when they took their leave saluted us with a warsong We were now so far advanced to the Northward and Eastward as to have reached that void space in our maps which is marked as a country unknown  Early in the morning of the th the boats were armed and manned and both Captains proceeded to examine the Sound in order to find a convenient place to refit the ships which had suffered materially in the violent gales which for the last twenty days they had been combating at the hazard of being hourly dashed to pieces upon the rocks or stranded upon the shores  In their progress they were fortunate enough to discover a cove the most convenient that could be wished the entrance of which was about two cables length bounded by high land on each side and furnished with wood and water now much wanted so conveniently situated that both could be taken on board at less than a cable's length from the shore but though now within the distance of four miles it was four o'clock in the evening before we could get the ships properly moored owing to the uncertainty of the weather and the violent gusts to which this coast is subject All this while the Indians behaved peaceably and apparently with much  friendship They brought after a short acquaintance a great variety of valuable skins such as beaver foxes racoons squirrels reindeer bears and several others with which we were but little acquainted but what they chiefly desired in exchange were cutlery wares of all sorts edgetools copper pewter iron brass or any kind of metal with the use of which they were not unacquainted All our people were now employed in the necessary repairs of the ships and in cutting wood and getting water on board while the gentlemen diverted themselves in shooting and botanizing  On the st of April about four in the evening there entered the cove a large canoe in which were thirty armed Indians who on their first appearance began a warsong and when they had finished took to their paddles and rowed round the ships having first stript themselves of their clothing except one man who stood upright in the vessel delivering an oration of which not a man on board could understand a word They paddled round the ships several times as if led by curiosity but did not offer to molest any of the workmen nor did they offer to trade But all hands being instantly ordered under arms these new visitors were seen to clothe themselves as before and to make towards the ships The Orator made not the least hesitation but mounted the ship's side and accosted the Captain with much civility and after receiving some presents and stopping a little while to observe the artificers he took a very polite leave descended to his boat and was landed on the opposite shore of the Sound  On the d a large body of Indians were seen paddling along the Sound mostly armed with  spears from to feet long and with bows and arrows very neatly made On their nearer approach they too were heard to tune up their warsong and to brandish their weapons as if in defiance of an enemy Their number was alarming there being not less than between and of them in their war canoes who we apprehended were come to attack us but we afterwards understood they were come to attack a body of their enemies on the opposite shore whom they afterwards engaged and returned victorious We were frequently visited by such parties who appeared always in arms but never offered the least violence They brought besides skins great quantities of fish with plenty of game which we purchased of them for glass bowls lookingglasses nails hatchets or whatever utensils or toys were either useful or ornamental  The men were of an athletic make very rough to appearance but more civilized than from their aspect there was reason to expect To iron they gave the name of tetumminé and to other metals chéàpoté  On the th the water which was excellent was so conveniently situated that by erecting a stage and constructing a spout we could convey it in casks into the ships without farther trouble This facilitated the labour of the waterers and shortened our stay as wood was conveyed on board with very little more trouble  On the th it blew a storm and the tide came rolling in at an alarming rate it presently rose eight or nine feet higher than usual and drifted several of our materials from the shore which we never could recover and at nine in the morning the Discovery drifted very near the Resolution and very narrowly escaped being bulged  On the th the artificers again resumed their labour The natives continued their visits and besides fish furs and venison brought bladders of oil which were greedily purchased by the men With this they made sauce for their saltfish and no butter in England was ever thought half so good  During our stay here which was but very short owing to the time lost in making the land and the advanced season of the year no people could be more obliging they were ready to accompany the gentlemen who delighted in shooting in their excursions and to shew them the different devices they made use of to catch and to kill their game they sold them their masks their calls and their gins and made no secret of their methods of curing the skins with which they carried on a traffic with occasional visitors in short a more open and communicative people does not live under the sun They have besides seafowl in abundance swans eagles and a variety of other landfowl of which we had never seen the species Nor were their fishermen more reserved than their hunters they pointed out the haunts of the different sorts of fish and they were not averse to helping their new acquaintance to compleat their lading whenever they had been unsuccessful in filling their boats  They had not hitherto discovered any disposition to pilfer but on the th day after our arrival several of them being on board and our people having no suspicion of their honesty one of them watched his opportunity to slip into the great cabin and carry off the Captain's watch which being soon missed all the Indians on board were seized their boats secured and searched and at length it was found hid in a box on board  one of their canoes which the offender delivered up without the least concern This watch had the thief been permitted to carry it off would probably have been parted with to the first sailor he had met with for a single nail About the same time another Indian made free with a bolt from the armourer's forge but was seen in the fact and an endeavour made to wrest it from him but he instantly jumped overboard and gave it to one of his companions who was making off with it till fired at with small shot which brought him back and he surrendered it but with such a fierceness expressed in his countenance as sufficiently indicated his intent In a moment every Indian in the cove disappeared and in less than three hours more than of them assembled in the Sound and being unclothed which is their custom when they mean to engage began their warsong and approached the ships We were in readiness to give them a warm reception but seeing our preparations and perhaps not liking our countenance they all laid down their arms and putting on their clothes came peaceably round the ship without offering the least incivility  Being in great want of masts most of those we brought out with us being sprung our carpenters were sent into the woods to cut down such trees as they should find fit for their purpose This they did without the least interruption from any of the inhabitants They found trees from to feet high without a knot and measuring from to feet in circumference In these trees the eagles build their nests When they had cut down what best suited their purpose the great difficulty was to bring them to the ships and in this labour they were assisted by the natives It was now their spring and  the weather began to change for the better When we first arrived the thermometer was as low as ½ and now  This th day of April it is as high as degrees We have at present the full range of the woods the snow all melted away and the rivers open We found plenty of game and catched fish in abundance  April This morning we were visited by a large body of Indians who had come from a great distance with furs and other articles of trade These were warmly clothed with cloaks of valuable furs that reached down to their ancles and among them was a stately youth to whom the rest paid great respect Him our Captain invited on board which he at first declined but after shewing him some axes glass bowls lookingglasses and other articles that excited his curiosity he suffered himself to be handed into the ship where he staid some time admiring every thing he saw While these continued to trade it was remarked that no other Indians came in sight but they had hardly left the ship when another body of Indians appeared more than double the number of the former who hemmed them all into the cove and stript them of every thing they had about them and then came and traded with us  At the same time a chief who had attached himself to Capt Cook came on board to take his leave and received a present for which in return he presented a beaverskin of much greater value This called upon the Captain to make a considerable addition to his present with which the chief was so pleased that he pulled off his beaverskin cloak and laid it at his feet Struck with this instance of generosity the Captain fetched him a  new broad sword with a brasshilt which made this chief compleatly happy  On the th having finished the repairs of the ships we began to prepare for our departure the tents were ordered to be brought on board the astronomers observatory and what livestock we had yet left and as the last service to be performed we cut grass for their subsistence which we were fortunate enough to find in plenty and to have a pretty good time to make it into hay We also by the assistance of Mr Nelson whose business as has already been observed was to collect the vegetable and other curious productions of the countries through which we passed were enabled to stock ourselves with a large proportion of culinary plants which was of infinite service to us in our more northerly progress And now having all things in readiness we began to tow out of the cove into the Sound to which Capt Cook gave the name of King George's Sound and with a light breeze and clear weather to proceed on our voyage but we had scarce reached the Sound when a violent gust from E S E threw us into the utmost confusion All our boats were out our decks full of lumber and night coming on dark and foggy our danger was equal to any we had hitherto met with in the course of the voyage though an especial Providence seemed to attend us and to interpose in our favour for by this storm a leak was discovered in the Resolution which had it been calm weather would probably have proved fatal to the crew Having cleared the Sound we shaped our course to the Westward and so continued till daylight when seeing nothing of the Resolution we shortened sail and before noon she came in sight seemingly in distress The storm continuing  we pursued our course to the Northwestward till  May st when the weather became fair and we proceeded with a pleasant breeze Being now at leisure to recollect what observations occurred at the harbour we have just left the curious reader will not be displeased with a short relation When we first arrived in the Sound the rough countenance of the men seemed to promise no very agreeable entertainment during our stay but when they saw our distress and that we only meant to repair our ships so far from giving us any disturbance they gave us every assistance in their power They supplied us regularly with fish and when they found that our men liked their oil they brought it in bladders and exchanged it for whatever they were pleased to give in return They discovered no propensity to thieve till they found we were preparing to depart and then they were so covetous of our goods that they could not resist the temptation when a fair opportunity offered to carry off whatever fell in their way  The cove in which we anchored we found to lie in deg min N and in deg min E but whether the Ruffian discoveries had reached so far we could not be able to determine that the inhabitants were no strangers to the use of iron and other metals was as has already been observed visible on our first approach but by their manner of using what they possessed it was not easy to discover from what quarter it came In the situation we were in we did not think it safe to venture far into the country having no spare hands to attend us Of their houses we saw but few and of their manner of living we know but little That they eat the  depiction of the people of the Soolka Sound  A Man and Woman of Soolka Sound  p  flesh of their enemies we had some reason to suppose by observing a human head in one of their canoes and arms and limbs in another but that fish and the flesh of the animals they catch in hunting are the principal part of their food is not to be doubted Their bread is made from the roes of fish but in what manner they prepare it we could not learn their sauces chiefly seablubber or oil We saw none of their houses near the shore by which it should seem that their winters are severe and that they chuse the recesses of the woods for shelter as well as safety The few houses we saw were all built of wood and hung round with dried fish and skins of various animals They have different masks for different purposes some they put on when they go to war which are really frightful some that cover their whole bodies and give them the appearance of the animals they are in pursuit of whose cries while they are young they are taught to imitate they have decoys excellently adapted for entrapping both fish and fowl and they have snares likewise for snaring wild beasts and contrivances for killing and curing them as soon as they are catched  We saw no plantations which exhibited the least trace of knowledge in the cultivation of the earth all seemed to remain in a pure state of nature shrubs there were in the woods that put forth blossoms and trees that promised in time to bring forth fruit but except some currant bushes wild rasberries and junipers we saw none bearing fruit that were known to any but Mr Nelson  The men were not ill made but they disfigured themselves with grease and coarse paint they were of a dark coppercolour with lank black  hair which they tied in a knot behind but they so bepowdered or rather befeathered it with down that the colour was hardly discernible their clothing was a cloak made of skins of beasts which covered them from the neck to their knees and gave them a savage appearance some of them wore high fur caps but the Chiefs among them had their heads dressed in a more becoming manner In that consisted their chief distinction Their heads were bound round with fillets decorated with feathers which adds so striking a grace to the human figure that almost every nation in the known world have agreed in making plumes of feathers a part of their warriors uniform Their weapons of war were spears from to feet long their bows about three feet and a half their arrows two feet pointed with bone or flint some few with iron but they had one horrid weapon peculiar to themselves resembling a man's head with hair it had eyes and nose but where the mouth should be a sharp piece of bone or flint about six inches long was firmly mortised and cemented in the neck part was a hole through which they passed a strong cord and fastened it to the right arm this we saw none of the warriors without many of them had besides a knife about twelve inches long of which they were very choice We saw no musical instruments among them but some had musical voices and seemed fond of dancing and tumbling in a bearish way Their canoes were of an uncommon length many of them from to yards long made of the main body of one of their enormous trees of which we have already spoken their breadth from four to five feet over in the middle and gradually narrowing like all others to both ends but the stem much higher than the stern They were  strengthened by bars of wood or stretchers placed across at certain distances and were rowed by paddles about six feet long swelling from the middle but sharp at the lower ends Some of those canoes were roughly carved and painted with the figures of the sun moon and stars probably the objects of their worship but what was remarkable they had no outriggers to prevent their oversetting like those of the southern isles  The women are much more delicate than the men and dress in cloaks curiously woven with the hair of wild beasts intermixed with the most beautiful furs We saw but few of them during our stay and those who came in sight were rather in years they were however much fairer than the men and even fairer than many of the men we had on board Their employment seems chiefly confined at home We saw none of them employed in fishing nor did we meet any of them in the woods Besides the care of their children and the manufacturing and making the clothing they may probably assist in curing and preparing the skins with which these people certainly carry on a traffic with strangers though of that trade for want of understanding their language we could not sufficiently inform ourselves Be that as it may when we left the harbour we had more than beaver skins on board besides other less valuable skins of foxes racoons wolves bears deer and several other wild animals for dogs excepted we saw no other domestic creatures about them  On May the st in the morning the weather being fine we spoke with the Resolution who informed us of the danger they were in of foundering in the late gale by a leak which increased so fast upon them that it baffled the utmost efforts  of all the hands they had on board gaining upon them considerably though every man in the ship even to the Captain took it in turn to work at the pumps but what was astonishing it had now stopt of itself without the carpenter's being able to discover either the cause or the cure However Capt Cook gave us to understand that he intended to put in at the first harbour he should fall in with  We were now in high spirits not dreaming of the hardships we had yet to suffer and we pursued our course at a great rate Before night we were in lat N and in long E with whole flocks of seafowl flying over our heads among which were strings of geese and swans all flying to the southward We had other indications of land and on  The d we came in sight of a high mountain being then in lat and in long E This mountain Capt Cook named  Mount Edgecomb    On the d at half an hour after four in the morning Mount Edgecomb bore S E a large inlet N E distant six leagues and the most advanced point of the land to the N W lying under a very high peeked mountain which obtained the name of  Mount Fair Weather  bore N W This inlet was called  Cross Sound  as being first seen on that day so marked in our calendar At noon the lat was and the long We continued our course to the northwestward as the land trended till the th when we opened on a very high island to which Capt Cook gave the name of  Kaye Island  in honour of his friend the Rev Dr Kaye Subalmoner to his Majesty A point shoots out from the main towards this island to which the Captain  gave the name of  Cape Suckling  This island on examination was found barren and destitute of inhabitants This we left to the southward and continued our course in hopes of discovering some harbour where the Resolution might examine her leaks We were now in lat and in long the land high and mountainous and covered with snow At four in the afternoon we came in sight of Cape Elias a vast promontory that seemed to cover its head in the clouds It bore from us S ½ W  On the th we had a flask calm which lasted for the space of four hours during which all hands were employed officers as well as men in fishing shooting or chasing the seals and sealions that played about the ships Great quantities of fine cod were caught which furnished a high treat to both ships companies and some docks sealarks and four seaparrots were killed by the fowlers In the evening a fresh breeze sprang up and we coasted along shore but saw no inhabitants though many fires were observed in the night within land In our course we passed a bay named by Capt Cook Comptrollers Bay Lat long  On the th we hauled up to double a cape to which our Commodore gave the name of Cape Hinchinbroke and saw the land trending very much to the northward About A M we tacked steering N N W and at nine in the morning opened a large strait the entrance of which appeared to be about four miles About four in the afternoon we entered the mouth of the strait and met a strong current that set to the southward to oppose our progress having a stiff breeze and the wind much in our favour we with difficulty stemmed the tide and before six in the evening the Resolution opened a close harbour  or bay that trended to the eastward round a bluff point of high land and was soon followed by the Discovery Here both ships cast anchor close under the lee of the land which we had scarce accomplished before the boats were ordered out and some eager to haul the seine and others to go a shooting were impatient to begin when unexpectedly they were alarmed by four canoes in which were between and Indians not more than two miles distant and rowing with all their might towards the boats who not being prepared for such an attack made the best of their way back to the ships As the Indians neared the boats they began their warsong as their custom is and brandishing their arms denounced defiance but by this time other boats armed from the ships had joined the sportsmen who were now so near the ships as to be out of danger The Indians had then time to cool they retreated to the opposite side of the harbour and in a very little time returned with a white cloak displayed as a signal of peace which was answered by a white flag and then they came on board without the least ceremony Their features size and colour differed little from those we had just left in George's Sound but they had a slit between their lower lip and chin through which they could put their tongue that gave them the appearance of having a double mouth Add to this the ornaments they wore in their noses and ears of tin and copper and no figures upon earth could be more grotesque However they behaved civilly and it being near night they took their leave promising to visit us again in the morning which they accordingly did bringing with them the very same forts of skins which we had purchased of the Indians at our former harbour and which they readily  parted with for any thing made of iron though they were rather choice These were clothed with the skins of birds neatly sewed together and they had besides a covering madelike parchment which in rainy or snowy weather was water proof so that no wet could affect them Their ordinary canoes too had coverings of the same kind  They had some instruments for fishing which we did not observe among the more southerly Indians such as harpoons and gigs all of which they were very ready to part with as well as their clothing of which though valuable to us they made but little account These were chiefly purchased by the sailors for glass beads who found them warmer and better adapted to the climate than any of their other clothing They had spears also and lances headed with iron very neatly manufactured and knives which they kept as bright as silver but these they refused to exchange for any thing we offered  In the morning of the th we weighed and pursued our course to the northward up the strait all day with the pleasing hope of having found the passage of which we were in search In our way we passed several very fine rivers that emptied their waters into that which we were now exploring About four in the afternoon we came to an anchor in fathom water and were surrounded with Indians who came to plunder but finding us on our guard they sneaked off without their booty Here being safely moored just opposite to a small rivulet of excellent water the boats were ordered out to fill the empty casks and the carpenters from both ships were set to work to find out the leak in the Resolution and after a most painful search a hole was discovered in the ship's side eaten quite through by the rats which by  the working of the ship in the storm had providentially filled with rubbish and thereby prevented her foundering So said our Journalist but Capt Cook observes that the seams were open both in and under the wale and in several places not a bit of oakum in them  On the th while we were employed on this necessary service we were visited by crowds of Indians persuading us to proceed but our pinnace being ordered out with boats to attend her in order to examine the strait it was found to be only an inlet through which there was no passage for ships or other vessels to any considerable distance Lat  To our great disappointment therefore after continuing here eight days during which time every part of the sound had been examined and the country for several miles round reconnoitred we took leave of this sound to which Capt Cook gave the name of Prince William's Sound to the great joy of the ships companies who with working the ships up one day and down another as wind and tide served were almost worn down with hard labour though none were sick nor did any accident happen to any except to William Austin who unfortunately had his leg broke by lifting an anchor out of the boat to launch it overboard and being entangled in the buoyrope went down with it in fathom water but came up again without any hurt and was afterwards by the care of the Surgeon perfectly cured  On the th when the weather which had been foggy cleared up we found ourselves surrounded by land on every side and sheltered in a nook called  Snug Corner Bay  and a snug corner it certainly was  On the th Mr Gore from the Resolution was sent to examine the northern arm of the inlet  depiction of the people of Prince William's Sound  A Man and Woman of Prince William's Sound  p  and Mr Bligh the master to take an easterly direction this last found the arm he went to examine to terminate in a group of islands Mr Gore reported that his arm was open and probably a passage might be found but Mr Roberts who accompanied him was of opinion that he saw the end of the inlet this to Capt Cook rendered the passage very doubtful and being willing to pursue his voyage to the North while the season was yet favourable he resolved to waste no more time in a fruitless search  On the th having the weather fine and the wind fair we returned to sea not by the same channel but by one more to the westward than that by which we entered It was separated from the other by an island extending leagues in the direction of Northeast and Southwest to which the Commodore gave the name of Montague Island and the intermediate islands because of their verdures he called Green Islands  Early on the st a storm came on which obliged us to lay to with the ship's head to the eastward but in the afternoon it abated and about five we came up with the southernmost promontory Cape Elizabeth which we had seen the day before and opened on a fine bay which trended full to the westward with very high land on both sides  In the morning of the d we tacked and stood to the westward and still saw the land trend very much to the southward Lat long  On the d the weather being clear and pleasant and there being little or no wind the boats were ordered out and all hands were employed in fishing except the Gentlemen who preferred the diversion of shooting  On the th a stiff breeze sprung up attended with very heavy squalls with snow and rain in which we carried away our main topgallantmast in the slings and received other damage in our sails and rigging This day we passed a deal of land to the westward which appeared to us like islands among which was that called Cape Hermogenes mostly very high we continued steering as the land trended and examining every bay and inlet as we passed along Lat  On the th we altered our course to N by W the land trending away to N E high and mountainous At noon we passed some large islands bearing from W S W to N W and which obtained the name of Barren Isles and soon after came in sight of a lofty promontory whose elevated summit forming two exceedingly high mountains was seen above the clouds To this promontory Capt Cook gave the name of Cape Douglas in honour of his good friend Dr Douglas Canon of Windsor  On the th at A M we perceived one continued chain of mountains to the highest of which was given the name of Mount St Augustine and saw two very high burning mountains at a considerable distance We kept steering to the northward as we saw no land ahead by reason of a great fog but as soon as the fog cleared up we found ourselves in the entrance of a vast river supposed to be about four miles over with a strong current setting to the southward lat  On the th we found the river to widen as we advanced and the land to flatten We continued under an easy sail all day and the following night sounding as we advanced from to fathom shelly bottom and white sand We were once more flattered with having found the passage  which we were in pursuit being now in the latitude of degrees north  On the th in the morning we sounded at fathom the tide still setting strong to the southward at the rate of five and six knots an hour but the wind dying away the signal was made for casting anchor when both ships came to in fathom water but the Resolution expecting to come to with her small stream anchor let the whole run out and lost both anchor and hauser besides the ship's grapnel in looking for it About at night the signal was made to weigh and sail but at ten the current ran so strong that both ships were again obliged to cast anchor in fathom bottom same as before It was now light all night and we could perceive the river to make N N W very rapid lat  On the th we made sail with a fresh wind and advanced apace but on trying the water we found a great alteration from salt to fresh This day we were visited by several Indians who brought skins of wolves foxes squirrels deer and some few beaver which they exchanged for trifles In the night we observed they made large fires but the flames from the two burning mountains seemed to darken their light We were now close under them and the roaring they made was infinitely more terrifying than the most tremendous thunder They are of an immense height and rise in the form of sugarloaves and bore N and S of each other and are called by the natives Eanebkay We found regular soundings all this day till opening into a large wide extended bay the water shallowed and we cast anchor in nine fathom water brown sand and shells as before  On the th the boats were ordered out and after a fruitless search to find a passage sounding from two to four fathom with the water brackish they returned in the morning and were taken on board In the evening they renewed their labour sounding to the north eastward as the day before they had sounded in the opposite direction  On the st the Resolution plyed higher up and came to an anchor in fathom water and found the ebb already begun It ran only three knots an hour and fell upon a perpendicular feet Here they saw an opening between the mountains and were in doubt whether the opening did not take an easterly direction through the above opening or whether that opening was only a branch of it and that the main channel continued its northern direction Next day Mr Bligh the master reported that he had found the inlet contracted to the breadth of one league by low land through which it continued its northerly direction that he proceeded three leagues through this narrow part which he found navigable for the largest ships but the water as it ran down fresh He landed on an island that it should seem divided this main channel and a branch that had an easterly course upon which he found current bushes with the fruit already June set and some other fruittrees unknown to him About three leagues beyond this he observed another separation in the eastern chain of mountains but still thought the main channel preserved its northern direction To get a nearer view of the eastern branch the Resolution weighed and plyed up before high water but the wind being contrary he was obliged to cast anchor and having dispatched two boats to make observations and examine the tides they found  that the flood set strong into the eastern branch which Capt Cook distinguished by the name of  River Turnagain  and that the ebb came out with still greater force Being now convinced that no passage was to be expected by this river any more than by the main branch Capt Cook gave orders to Mr King to land on the northern point of the low land there to display the flag and take possession of the country and river and to bury in the ground a bottle containing some pieces of English coin of the year and a paper on which was inscribed the names of the ships and the date of the discovery In the mean time a party of us with officers attended by a serjeant's guard of marines landed on the easternmost shore in order to reconnoitre the country We had proceeded more than four miles without seeing one inhabitant and were going to scour the woods for game when a body of Indians to the number of forty or fifty rushed out of an adjoining thicket all armed after their manner with bows and spears a few of our marines discharged their pieces over their heads which instantly stopt their career and they were retreating as rapidly as they came on when the officer who had the command advancing singly grounded his piece and made signs for them to halt One who seemed to have the command of the rest turning suddenly about observed his motions and understood them and calling to the rest they all stopt and after a short consultation laid down their arms and stripping themselves quite naked laid their clothes down by them This we understood they did to show that they had no arms concealed We then advanced and entered into a kind of dumb discourse of which we could understand enough to know that they wanted us to accompany them to their town which we very  readily did they very deliberately put on their clothes and then shewed us the way  When we arrived we found a number of wretched huts with women and children old men and dogs who at first sight of us were more frightened than their masters hanging their tails and sneaking away One of these Mr Law our Surgeon purchased These huts consisted of nothing but long poles rudely constructed into the form of a hovel and covered over with heathy earth For a door they had a hole just large enough to creep in at which in cold weather they close with a kind of faggot Their inner apartments were holes or pits dug in the earth and divided like stalls in a stable Their furniture we did not take the pains to survey We saw some bladders full of blubber or fat hanging about and some skins of beasts also dried fish in plenty We likewise saw several wooden utensils besides their arms and we saw quantities of salt in wooden troughs They had dried flesh too probably the remains of their winter provisions which we understood they eat raw and some of which they offered us for dinner In these huts or holes they burn no fire but in the winter they shut themselves up close and have lamps which they continually keep burning for here during the winter months they scarce ever see the sun We were not a little surprised at the sight of some of their children who were as fair and their skins as white as those of many children in England their dark coppery complexion is therefore owing to their anointing and greasing their children when they are young and exposing them to all weathers while they have light and shutting them in their smoaky caverns when it is dark We found little or no difference between  the people in this sound and those we have described in the other except having large drops or ornaments at their ears and noses of beads of their own making These they would not part with They had gloves and boots likewise of their own manufacturing and cloaks very curiously wrought Their hair in general was long and black which they dress and decorate with feathers and down The women wear ornaments of ivory beads or transparent stones which they hang to their ears or run across their nostrils with a needle of bone about an inch and a half long having another of equal length which they pass cross a false mouth just above the chin To these they string their ornaments as in the figure annexed and in this consists their pride Having gratified our curiosity we returned to our ships and having nothing farther to detain us  On the d of June in the afternoon we set sail The same afternoon the Resolution struck and stuck fast on a bank in the middle of the river but on the return of the tide floated off without any damage We were now in lat N and in long E many leagues within land and it was not till the th that we cleared the channel  The th being his Majesty's birthday we kept as a day of rejoicing  On the th we passed the burning mountains and the wind dying away we cast anchor and shooting and fishing now took place of watching and hard labour While the crews were pursuing their sport two canoes approached the ships with more than forty strangers who were differently clothed from those Indians we had hitherto seen in this latitude They brought with them curiosities of various kinds and shapes also great quantities of skins of seals wolves deer black  and white foxes racoons martins sables and some few beavers which they themselves had compleatly manufactured and were soon purchased by those on board The dress of these men were skins of birds with the feathers outwards very neatly sewed and reaching from the neck to the midleg Under these they had a kind of trowsers which parted in the middle and surrounded their thighs Under their feet they had a coarse covering that served for shoes All these though the weather was cold they parted with and most of them went naked from the ships making signs for us to follow them though it was not easy to discover from whence they came nor where they were to go  The th a breeze sprang up and we cleared the strait to the unspeakable joy of the sailors who during the whole time from our entrance till our return worked with incredible labour anchoring and weighing as in the former sound just as the winds and the tide afforded opportunity During our passage we had frequent interviews with the natives who the nearer we approached the shore were as we have observed better clothed and shewed some manufactures of their own and of other nations and were in possession of a greater variety of skins than those within land which were strong indications of a foreign trade but by what conveyance carried on all our endeavours at this time could not discover This day we passed the barren isles  On the th at noon St Hermogenes bore N four leagues distant It appeared green and fertile  On the th we continued this course with very little variation till night when a thick fog came  on and we lost sight of the Resolution This weather continued till  The th when the Resolution in coasting along the main ran foul of a dangerous reef that appeared just above water close under her leebow Her good fortune still accompanied her for she slid off without damage Lat long  On the th we were alarmed by the clashing of the waves as if some great building was tumbling in and looking round the ship we saw ourselves involved among shoals of seals and sealions who presently set up the most frightful howlings at the same time we observed a large whale to pass along at which we fired a swivel but without effect We this day stood to the NorthEast as the land trended  On the th Cape St Barnabas bore N E At eight o'clock we opened upon some new land the extreme Eastward point of which bore E S E In the evening we stood S  On the th in the morning we saw  Trinity Island  distant or leagues lat lon We directed our course along shore  On the th the weather hazy we lost sight of land sounded and found no ground at fathom A storm came on and both ships stood to sea  On the th it abated the weather clear came in sight of Foggy Island so called by Beering stood W N W with a stiff breeze lat at noon by observation long  On the th stood in and saw land trend S ½ E as far as the eye could carry At nine in the morning we opened a large bay the entrance of which from S W to N W about three miles over but having a fine breeze in our favour we  continued along shore We were now about two leagues distant from the shore which was covered with geese ducks shags and seafowls innumerable  On the th we coasted along shore and passed many dangerous rocks and shoals which we saw project from the main into the sea to a great distance We were now in lat long E At two in the afternoon we passed two large islands to the Southward of us and about three had passed all the land to the Southward when being within half a mile of the main we observed three canoes making towards us in which were six Indians When they came along side they made signs for us to drop our anchors intimating that the people on shore would be glad to see us at the same time we thought we heard the report of a gun Little notice however was taken of what passed The people from the gangway talked with the men one of whom made signs for letting down a rope to which he tied a neat box curiously made up with small twine for which he would take nothing in return The man who took it looked upon it as a great curiosity and after the Indians were gone began to examine the contents when a note was found in the inside which was immediately carried to the Captain and a consultation was held on the quarterdeck to endeavour to decypher the contents but none on board the Discovery could make out a letter The ship was then hoveto three guns fired and a jack hoisted to the masthead for stopping the Resolution This being observed all on board were struck with fear for the safety of the Discovery thinking that some fatal disaster had happened and that she was going to the bottom Their boat was instantly hoisted out  and Mr Williamson third Lieutenant came in all haste to learn the cause With him our Captain returned and related what had happened and shewed Captain Cook the note who likewise held a consultation upon it and it was handed from the quarterdeck to the gangway where every man in the ship might see it but not a man could make out more than something like the date of which they were not clear We therefore continued our course along the coast as the land trended but saw no opening nor any inhabitants About midnight we saw a vast flame ascend from a burning mountain and observed several fires within land Latitude by observation N long E  On the th early in the morning looking out ahead we saw something like a reef before us and fired a gun for the Resolution to tack happy that daylight had enabled us to escape the danger  On the st we steered S W but at eight A M finding the land to trend more to the Southward we altered our course to S S W the extreme of the land in sight bearing W by S seven or eight leagues very high land and much snow About two in the afternoon we came again in sight of the two burning mountains which we had before seen but at a great distance bearing N W by N Our course during the night was S S W During the course of this day the weather being fair and but little wind the men were employed in fishing and in less than four hours caught more than three ton weight of cod and holybut some of the latter more than a hundred pounds weight Here a man in a small canoe came on board the Resolution He bowed and pulled off his cap and shewed evident signs of  having had commercial dealings with the Russians He wore a pair of green cloth breeches and a jacket of black cloth He had nothing to barter except a grey fox skin  On the d our men were employed in salting and barreling up for future use what the ship's company could not consume while fresh which proved a most acceptable supply All this day we kept our course S W by S  On the d in the evening we shaped our course more to the Westward the weather thick and hazy  On the th little wind and hazy Saw no land but looking over the ship's side observed the water to change to a milky white Sounded and found ground at fathom About four P M we saw two very high islands bearing N W distance about five leagues and could discern the main land contiguous We bore away under the lee of the Westernmost and continued steering all night S by W  On the th in the morning we changed our course steering S W as the land trended At ten the same morning we had a full view of the land for many miles but saw no signs of houses or inhabitants but doubtless though the country appeared rugged and barren and in many places white with snow there were many people in the inland parts About seven in the evening we could see land at a great distance bearing due South which had the appearance of a large island Hitherto we had been exploring the coasts of an unknown continent unknown at least to our European geographers though we shall see by the sequel that it was not wholly unexplored by the Asiatic Russians Towards night though it had been perfectly clear all day the air began to  thicken and by ten at night the fog was so thick that we could not see the ship's length We kept firing guns burning false fires and standing off land all night as did the Resolution and in the morning of the  th when the fog dispersed we found ourselves in a deep bay surrounded by high lands and almost ashore under a high mountain which we had not before discerned Both ships instantly dropt anchor in fathom water blue muddy bottom within two cables length of the shore and among shoals and breakers from which we most miraculously escaped For some time we stood in amazement how we could possibly get into such a frightful situation But being in it for our own safety we moored both ships and happy it was we used that precaution for a gale came on when our whole existence depended upon the goodness of our cables In the evening the boats were got out and the Captain with several other gentlemen went on shore but with great danger were landed as were likewise some boats from both ships to cut grass for the live stock that yet remained They afterwards found that this was an island called by the Russians Vonulashka Island but saw no inhabitants In their excursion the gentlemen shot two eagles and several other birds of various sorts and soon returned on board the ships Lat obs Long E  On the th at three A M it ceased blowing and the weather began to clear At six we unmoored and sailed under close reefed topsails directing our course N W for an opening we saw at about a league distance but at nine the wind dying away we anchored again in fathom water loamy sand It being a dead calm our  boats were ordered out and some gentlemen went again on shore to examine the island more closely In their search they found something like an Indian mansion being a deep pit sunk in the earth with some poles placed across it after their manner and covered with sods and a hole to creep into it about two feet square In it they found the bones of dried fish and of birds and near it a place where there had been a fire but all had the appearance of being long deserted They also found the rib of a whale about eight feet long which it was not easy to account how it could come there About noon the gentlemen returned on board and a breeze springing up from the Eastward we weighed and took leave of this dangerous bay to which Capt Cook gave the name of Providence Bay as it was owing to Providence that we were here miraculously preserved from perishing We had pleasant weather all day and the land high all round us We sounded all the afternoon from to fathom mostly sandy bottom In the evening we saw a large body of Indians towing a whale which they had struck who were too busy to mind us till late when two canoes came alongside and traded We were surprised when they asked us for tobacco and more so when they shewed us some together with snuff in their boxes As tobacco was a precious commodity on board we could spare them little but for that little they were thankful and departed We passed several islands to the Eastward very high and mountainous  On the th in the morning Mr Nelson accompanied by several other gentlemen went on shore botanizing they found great variety of plants and flowers peculiar to the country besides others with which we were all well acquainted  such as primroses violets currants rasberries juniper and many other Northern fruits which were now all in blossom They found also a bird's nest with five small eggs not unlike a sparrow's After some stay they came again on board and the wind dying away and the Resolution having got far ahead our boats were employed in towing us when a strong current meeting us right ahead baffled their endeavours This current ran with such force that the Resolution unable to stem it cast anchor and soon after was joined by the Discovery Here several canoes came from the land to trade and made signs for more tobacco of which our own men were in great want About noon we opened on a fine harbour to the Westward of us but we were the whole afternoon in working up the Race as it was called from the rapidity of its motion and the strength with which it set against us Our first attempt to stem it proved fruitless We were driven as far back as the place from whence we set out On the tide's turning in our favour we made a second attempt and succeeded About six in the evening we cast anchor fathom water and soon after came to moorings We were in less than an hour surrounded with more than thirty canoes with rock fish and dried salmon which they exchanged for beads small nails or any thing we offered them They had likewise some very pretty baskets of their own making with other utensils which plainly indicated a communication with foreign traders  On the th the boats were employed in watering the ships and the sailmakers c began to overhaul the rigging and all hands were employed in different repairs In the mean time several Indians hovered round the ships with fish  ready dressed which they presented to any indiscriminately who would accept them but would take nothing in return except tobacco or snuff were offered them neither did they offer to steal or take any the most trifling thing away and what was remarkable not a woman was to be seen nor did any come near the ship during our stay Our Captain took notice of two that seemed superior to the rest he invited them on board and with much entreaty prevailed on them to enter He made them presents of a few beads and two or three hands of tobacco each for which they in the most submissive manner expressed their gratitude All this while our botanist and his attendants were busily employed and sent plenty of celery and other wholesome herbs on board as well for the use of the great cabin as for those of the subordinate tables down even to the lowest of the ship's company  On the th both Captains landed in order to survey the island and take a more accurate view of the harbour Captain Cook intending to make this the place of rendezvous on his return they met with several friendly Indians in their way to whom they made presents  On the st of July the signal was given to unmoor but the wind shifting to N N E Mr Edgar master of the Discovery accompanied by several other gentlemen made a visit to an Indian town which they saw at the distance of five or six miles situated on the side of a pleasant little hill that seemed to command a view of the bay and of a great extent of country around At this town they arrived about ten in the morning when a welllooking old man made them understand he was chief of the place To him therefore they made their addresses by presenting him with some  depiction of the people of Onalashka  A Man and Woman of Onalashka  p  trifles and a small hand of tobacco By way of return he made signs for the strangers to sit down and when they were seated he brought them fish of various sorts dried and fresh and some dried venison which however they declined to taste observing therefore that the strangers wanted only to satisfy their curiosity he made signs for them to follow him leading them to every house and last of all to his own These houses were no other than square caverns dug in the ground and latticed with rough poles over which were laid sods of earth leaving a square hole in the middle like a hatchway through which to enter They descended by means of a ladder made by cutting notches in a beam deep enough to receive the toes and the ball of the foot and by that ladder women and children as well as men run up and down like so many rats without fear of falling The old Indian did not seem willing to shew the gentlemen the inside of the houses nor were they oversolicitous to examine them The smell when they looked down was enough to satisfy them These holes or houses if they may be so called were some of them forty feet long thirty broad and about twelve feet deep In these they never burn fire but kindle their fires at some distance chiefly in the night but for what reason we could never learn Hence it is that sailors are enabled to judge of the populousness of a country by the number of these fires that are seen from the shore From the houses the old Indian led them to the sheds where they manufactured their skins shewed their manner of dressing them their storehouses and in short all their arts and artificers their women only excepted of whom one only made her appearance and she was old and far from being inviting About  eight in the afternoon the gentlemen returned and however they might be surfeited with what they had seen they shewed by the dinner they made that they had not lost their appetite  While Mr Edgar c were thus pleasing themselves with one kind of amusement Mr Law Surgeon was diverting himself with another He went a hunting and traced an old fox to her cover where after digging a considerable way he found seven young ones two of which he brought on board and one of them lived a long time after  On the d of July we cleared the harbour called by the inhabitants Samganooda situated on the Northside of Oonalashka in lat long About noon we saw the land trend to S S E hauled up to E N E and continued all night in that course  On the d at two A M she wore ship and stood to the Southward till daylight and then tacked and steered E N E At noon we saw the extreme of the land bearing E ½ S  On the th at two A M we steered N N E At ten sounded at seventy fathom blue mud shelly bottom and making very little way our men were employed in fishing and in less than four hours catched upwards of weight of cod At noon we had an observation lat N long Course all night N E  On the th we saw the land very low and even trending away to the Southward of the East We were distant from the Northernmost shore three or four leagues and from this day we began sounding till our arrival in watering harbour This day all hands employed in fishing and as our people were now put on twothirds allowance what each caught he might eat or sell Fortunate for them they caught some tons of fine  fish which proved a most seasonable supply for the ship provisions what with salt and maggots eating into the beef and pork and the rats and weavils devouring the heart of the bread the one was little better than putrid flesh and the other upon breaking would crumble into dust At noon this day we directed our course N N E being now in lat long per watch  On the th we continued the same course and sounding found ground at twelve fathom We tacked and stood to the S E and sounding again found ground at three fathoms and a half We were now in Beering's Straits We tacked instantly and stood to the North having had another providential escape from running upon the rocks We got out our boats and sounded from to ½ fathom rocky bottom for eight or nine leagues to the Northward Lat long We were now in a most perilous and laborious navigation sounding every day and every day in danger of perishing on the rocks  On the th sounded from twelve to four fathom hard bottom with shells Lat long  On the th sounded from seven to twenty fathom small shells with sand Lat long per watch  On the th a great fog lay by most part of the day sounded from six to ten fathoms and a half lat by observation long  On the th we had thunder hail and rain The men almost exhausted with fatigue sounded from twelve to nine fathoms and a half Lat long  The th we came in sight of land The air clear and pleasant we steered N W by W the  Westward point of land in sight bearing W ½ N This day the gentlemen from both ships diverted themselves in shooting At noon our Captain returned on board with three seaparrots four pigeons several gulls teals and shags These parrots are in size and shape not unlike those on land but webfooted and their plumage different Numbers of them were shot and brought to England as curiosities The pigeons too are much like those on land but webfooted and make a most disagreeable cooing much like the croaking of the sealion sounded from twelve to six fathoms Lat long  On the th nothing material the day was pleasant and he had a full view of the land but saw neither tree nor bush sounded from eight to sixteen fathom Latitude by observation  The th sounded from eight to thirteen fathom Lat long  The th we coasted along shore N N W and at three in the afternoon found ourselves to the windward of the Southward point with a strong tide setting to the S E About four a thick fog arose and being within two miles of the shore came to an anchor in ten fathom water the extreme point of land to the Westward bearing N N W very high distant between six and seven leagues Sounded all day from ten to twelve fathom Latitude by observation long  The th about ten in the morning the weather clear and fine we came to an anchor in seventeen fathom water lat long Here the cutters from both ships were manned and all the gentlemen went on shore We saw no other inhabitants but bears and foxes and some wild deer we heard in the adjoining woods  the howlings and yellings of wolves and other wild beasts but thought it neither safe nor seasonable to pursue them After spending the greatest part of the day in botanizing with Mr Nelson we returned on board leaving on the bluff part of a rock a bottle behind us in which were enclosed some blue and white beads with a note of the ships names the date when left by whom and on what expedition We found near the shore the horns of some seamonsters from twenty to twentyfour inches long nearly as thick as a man's leg at the root and tapering to a point with a gradual sweep Lat long We were no sooner returned than a breeze sprang up when we weighed and again made sail with the ships heads W N W  The th the water shallowed so fast that it was thought prudent to drop anchors again and to send the boats out with a compass to examine the strait to a considerable distance ahead In half an hour a gun was fired from the boats as a signal not to proceed and the man at the masthead saw land appear just above water This proved a barren spot not above an acre wide with nothing but shells and the bones of fishes on it The boats having sounded from W to N W by N from two to one fathom and a half returned with their report that no passage could be found in that direction From this day to the th the boats were continually sounding in all directions amidst the most dreadful tempest of thunder lightning and hail that ever blew but such was our danger that Capt Cook himself shared in all the labour and what added to our misfortune the Resolution parted her best bower within ten fathoms of the anchor and it was wonderful that she was not wrecked Lat long  On the th all hands that could be spared were employed in sweeping for the anchor but in vain being quite worn down with fatigue they were forced to give over and men from the Discovery were ordered to supply their places Latitude by observation long  On the th the anchor was recovered when every officer on board both ships was obliged to do the duty of common men No pen can describe our danger from the horrible situation we were in  The th was wholly employed in sounding from eight to two fathom Lat long  On the th Captain Cook himself in sounding to the S E found a narrow channel regular soundings from eight to ten fathom Hope took place of despair and all hands returned to their labour with fresh spirits We presently weighed and pursued our course with a fine breeze The day continuing clear at noon we had an observation in lat long E This day we were visited by some Indians who had little to part with except dried fish and bows and arrows The only peculiarity we observed was that most of them had their heads shaved close They seemed fondest of Otaheite and other Indian cloth for which they would part with any thing  On the st about noon both ships brought to the wind and current both uniting to oppose our progress founded from twelve to five fathoms and a half Lat long  On the d we were overjoyed on sounding to find the sea deepen to forty fathom but before night that joy was much damped by a prodigious fall of snow of which it was with difficulty that the decks could be kept clear though the water  was constantly employed in shovelling it off during the night Lat long course S S W  The d made sail and steered W Lat  The th continued our course W by

tacked and stood off Long per watch  On the th we continued alongshore course N ½ E sounding from twentyfive to thirtyfive fathom Lat long  The st we were again alarmed with irregular soundings from ten to thirty fathom but were soon relieved by the water deepening Lat long per watch  August the st the sea continued to deepen but the land trending to the southward obliged us to change our course We were now in lat N long E  On the d we again bore away N W all the morning and at noon tacked to N E by N Lat long  The d course all day N N E This course we pursued with a little variation to the eastward till the evening when we saw land bearing S W distance seven or eight leagues Latitude by observation long This day word was brought us from the Resolution of the death  of Mr Anderson the surgeon His funeral was performed with the usual seaceremonies and our surgeon Mr Law was appointed in his place and Mr Samuel surgeon's mate of the Resolution succeeded Mr Law  The th at noon sounding from fifteen toten fathom we came again in sight of land which bore from us W to N ½ E At noon we sounded and found only eight fathoms and a half In the evening we came to an anchor in fifteen fathom Lat long  On the th we came to in twelve fathom water under the lee of a small but high island in lat long to which Captain Cook gave the name of Sledge Island as a sledge and the remains of a Russian town were found upon it but no inhabitants There were likewise found some Russian snowshoes Mr Nelson and his associates found on this island great quantities of wild celery and a kind of wild vetch or chichling of which the ship's company made the proper use  Early on the th we weighed and stood W by N As we coasted along shore several Indians were seen on the opposite side of the island who were to all appearance preparing to pay us a visit We hove to but after waiting an hour and none coming we continued our course We soon came again into shallow water and finding the land too near us from the western shore we altered our course to N N W sounding from four to six fathom water six leagues from the main land We were now obliged to come to anchor as a heavy snow darkened the air and rendered our proceeding hazardous Lat long  On the th judging ourselves near the shore though not in sight we weighed and tacked and as the fog dispersed we saw the land mountainous and rocky with neither tree nor shrub in sight but exhibiting the most dreary prospect that the mind of man can conceive At the same time an island was seen bearing N W eight or nine leagues distant named by us King's Island It seemed of no great extent We hastened from this horrid situation but in the course of the day were under the necessity of coming to an anchor three times but in launching it the last time we observed the stock of our best bower to be sprung Nothing could equal our apprehensions We immediately made signals and acquainted our Commodore with our distress Fortunately the stock of an unserviceable bestbower hung over our side which by the assistance of the carpenters and smiths of the Resolution added to our own was in less than twentyfour hours though under every disadvantage substituted in the room of the other and rendered perfectly safe And happy it was for  On the th we had a violent storm of hail rain and snow which continued all the morning but the wind dying away about noon and the current setting to the N E we were drifted to leeward close in shore under a very high track of land and among rocks and breakers Both ships instantly came to in fathom water the Resolution with her bestbower within two miles of the shore and the Discovery with her coasting anchor Here we saw high land extending from N by W to N W by N distant about three leagues Over the western extreme was an elevated peaked hill situated in lat and in long Under this hill lies some low land stretching out  to the N W the extreme point of which bore F by E This point of land is the more remarkable being the western extremity of all America hitherto known and named by Capt Cook  Cape Prince of Wales  And now a breeze springing up in our favour we quitted this perilous situation and seeing the land trend away to the N W we directed our course accordingly till having doubled the westernmost point we steered again to the eastward and continued that course the whole night  On the th about A M we came again to an anchor a strong current from to knots an hour setting against us but the ships pitching bows under and the water from the upper deck running as through a sieve to the lower deck in less than half an hour every thing between decks was afloat so that the poor men had not a dry rag to put on This obliged us to weigh as fast as possible but in our situation that was a work of no small labour and difficulty as at this time many of our hands through fatigue and being constantly exposed to the rain and snow and in a damp ship were ill of colds attended with slow fevers which rendered them incapable of duty Out of hands officers included we could only muster to the capstern We had with difficulty weighed our small bower and had made two unsuccessful attempts at the sheet anchor when the Resolution left us making all the sail she could carry to surmount the current We were now in the utmost distress but by contriving several additional purchases we at last succeeded with the misfortune however of having two of our ablest hands wounded and it was next to a miracle that none were killed The Resolution was now out of sight but judging our distress she lay to amidst  a cluster of islands of which we told no less than seven very small but very high As soon as we came in sight she made sail and we followed with all the sail we could crowd till about midnight when we were surprised by a sudden squall which split our main topsail and shivered our jib to ribbons it was however of short continuance Lat long  On the th we had fine weather and a calm sea and were proceeding at a great rate our course W when unexpectedly we opened into a deep bay where we saw at the distance of a few leagues a large Indian town which our Commodore at first supposed to belong to the island of Alaschka but from the figure of the coast the situation of the opposite shore of America and from the longitude he found reason to alter his opinion and to conclude that it was a part of the country of Tschutski or the eastern extremity of Asia explored by Beering in Long Here we cast anchor in fathom water and both Captains attended by a proper guard went on shore About or men each armed with a spontoon a bow and arrows stood drawn up on a rising ground close by the village As we drew near three of them came down towards the shore and were so polite as to take off their caps and to make us low bows We returned the civility but this did not inspire them with sufficient confidence for the moment we advanced they retired Capt Cook followed them alone without any thing in his hand and by signs prevailed on them to receive some trifling presents In return they gave him two fox skins and a couple of seahorse teeth They seemed very cautious expressing their desire by signs that no more of our people might be permitted to come up On  Capt Cook's laying his hand on the shoulder of one of them he started back and in proportion as the Captain advanced the natives retreated always in the attitude of being ready to make use of their spears while those on the rising ground stood ready to support them with their arrows Insensibly a few of our people got in among them but a few beads being distributed to those about them soon created a confidence and by degrees a sort of traffic commenced In exchange for knives beads tobacco and other articles they gave us some of their clothing and a few arrows but nothing could induce them to part with a spear or a bow These they held in constant readiness never quitting them except at one time when four or five of them laid theirs down while they gave us a song and a dance Their arrows were pointed either with bone or stone but very few of them had barbs and some were blunted The use they made of these was probably to kill small animals without damaging their skins The bows were such as we had seen used by the American Esquimaux The spears or spontoons were of iron or steel of European or Asiatic workmanship curiously ornamented with carvings and inlayings of brass and white metal Those who stood ready with their bows and arrows had their spears slung over their right shoulders a quiver slung over their left with arrows some of their quivers were extremely beautiful being made of red leather on which were very neat embroidery and other ornaments Several other things and in particular their clothing shewed they were not destitute of ingenuity  All the Americans we had seen since our arrival on that coast were rather low of stature with round chubby faces and high cheek bones  The people we now were among had long visages and were stout and wellmade In short they appeared to be a quite different nation We saw neither women nor children nor any aged except one man who was baldheaded and carried no arms The other seemed to be picked men and rather under than above the middle age All of them had their ears bored and some of them had glass beads hanging to them These were the only fixed ornaments we saw among them for they wore none to their lips in which they essentially differ from their American neighbours  Their clothing consisted of a cap a frock a pair of breeches a pair of boots and a pair of gloves all made of the skins of deer dogs seals c extremely well dressed some with the hair or fur on and others without The caps were made to fit the head very close and besides these caps which most of them wore we got from them some hoods made of the skins of dogs large enough to cover both head and shoulders Their hair seemed to be black but their heads were either shaved or the hair cut close off and none of them wore any beard Of the articles they got from us knives and tobacco they valued most  We found the village composed both of their summer and their winter habitations The latter are exactly like vaults the floors of which are sunk a little below the surface of the earth and boarded and under them a kind of cellar in which we saw nothing but water At the end of each house was a vaulted room which we took to be a storeroom Over it stood a kind of sentrybox or tower composed of the large bones of large fish  The summerhuts were pretty large and conical The framing was of light poles and bones covered  with the skins of seaanimals We examined the inside of one There was a fireplace just within the door near which lay a few wooden vessels all very dirty Their bedplaces were close to the sides Some privicies seemed to be observed for there were several partitions made of skins The bed and bedding were of deerskins and most of them were dry and clean  About these habitations were several stages ten or twelve feet high for drying their fish and skins out of the reach of their dogs of which they had many large and of different colours with long soft hair like wool probably used in drawing the sledges for sledges they had in their huts Perhaps these dogs being numerous may constitute a part of their food for several of them lay dead that had been killed that morning  Their canoes are of the same sort with those of the Northern Americans  By the large fishbones and of other seaanimals that lay scattered about it appears that the sea supplies them with the greatest part of their substance  After a stay of about two or three hours with these people we returned to our ships and pur+sued our voyage  On the th we passed several large islands to the eastward of us and at the same time left the extreme point of the northern cape of Asia which we saw trend away to the W by S as far as the eye could carry mostly high land barren and covered with snow We then bore away to the northeast sounding from to fathom and about P M finding the sea to change of a milky colour and at the same time to shallow very fast we came to in fathom water and sent the boats out to sound who soon returned finding  the sea to deepen as they proceeded We then got under way standing all night N one half W passing in the night several large sea cows and other sea monsters Lat long  On the th we altered our course and stood to the westward when both ships tacked and plyed to the North leaving two very small islands on our starboard bow In the evening we crossed the arctic circle and stood all night W by S long  In the morning of the th we stood once more north eastward We were now in lat and from to fathom water the weather warm and fine We altered our course and steered all night N N E  On the th in the morning we hauled our wind and stood with the ship's head to the N E About in the afternoon we came in sight of land distance about or leagues very high woody and covered with snow we stood in for land but finding the coast rugged and the water shoal we stood again W S W and continued that course the whole night Lat long  On the th finding ourselves attacked by a heavy storm of wind attended with rain we bore away N W by W and continued that course till the evening when we shortened sail and stood to the southward Lat obs long  On the th at noon we found ourselves in lat long E We then stood from N N E to N E sounding from to fathom water Lat long  On the th the weather began to grow pierceing cold The frost set in and froze so hard that the running rigging was soon loaded with ice and rendered almost impossible to make the sheafs or  blocks traverse without the assistance of six men to do the work of one But what was most remarkable was the sudden transition from heat to such severe cold The day before was warm and pleasant but in the evening of this day the ice was seen hanging at our hair our noses and even at the men's fingers ends if they did but expose them to the air for five or six minutes and still the farther they ran to the eastward the colder it grew and the ice the more connected About in the afternoon we found ourselves surrounded with large floating islands of ice which like clouds in the sky were continually varying their appearances but the farther we ran to the eastward the closer the ice became compacted As the weather was now clear though piercing cold we could see the ice extending on every side E and W as far as the eye could carry We stood to the northward and being embayed we observed a large island floating with the tide towards us whereon was supposed to rest great numbers of seamonsters Being apprehensive of danger the signal was made for tacking We kept off and on all night Lat long  On the th hot victuals froze while we were at table and this weather continued for some days Being now well in with the ice and having lost sight of land we kept working to the westward At noon a great fog came on but soon clearing up the sun made his appearance and we had an observation by which we found we were in lat long About eight at night it blew a gale with heavy snow we shortened sail and stood to the southward  The th when looking round in the morning as soon as the fog cleared away we saw nothing but fields of ice covered with whole herds of sealions  seahorses and other amphibious animals to the number as it was thought of some thousands Thus surrounded a signal was made from the Resolution to bring to and to load the great guns while the boats were getting ready to attack these hideous looking creatures with muskets This by the sailors from both ships was accounted sport and they went to the attack with as much alacrity as if to a match at football Orders were given as soon as the great guns were discharged to quicken the attack with the musketry as fast as possible In a few minutes not a creature was to be seen upon the ice but such as were killed or so severely wounded as not to be able to crawl to the open sea Some lay growling on the ice not quite dead with two or three balls through their heads and others tumbling about with horrible vindictive looks threatening destruction to whoever should approach them These monsters when at their growth are in length from the head to the hindmost fin from eleven to twelve feet round the belly from twenty to twentysix feet Four long stiff fins serve them for feet with which they crawl or slide upon the ice and move with wonderful agility two large tusks at the distance of or inches apart project from the nostrils in length from twenty inches to two feet four thick at the root and tapering to a point their forehead resembles that of a bull They have whiskers on each side the mouth about six inches long as stiff as a knittingneedle with which they raise themselves upon the ice Their eyes are small They have no teeth nor have they any tail They have like the seals some little hair upon their skins but very thin and are upon the whole most horribly ugly creatures After the engagement was over all hands were employed  to collect the carcasses and to carry them on board but what was thought an ill reward for their labour orders were next day given by Capt Cook to substitute the flesh of these seamonsters in the room of all other provisions bread or flour only excepted This was strongly opposed by the crew of the Resolution and Capt Clerke remonstrated against it He was told by Capt Cook that he might do as he pleased on board his own ship but the state of the provisions on board the Resolution made it necessary and that he himself should set the example Capt Clerke endeavoured but in vain to enforce the order and the matter passed on without any serious consequences  On the th we tacked ship and stood to the westward the wind much against us We tacked every two hours still working over to the Asiatic shore with a view to examine the coasts on both sides before we returned to the southward We were now in lat long  On the st we came in sight of the continent of America extending from S by E to E by S the nearest part five leagues distant  We continued labouring among the ice till the th when a storm came on which made it dangerous for us to proceed a consultation was therefore held on board the Resolution as soon as the violence of the gale abated when it was unanimously resolved that as this passage was impracticable for any useful purpose of navigation which was the great object of the voyage to pursue it no farther especially in the condition the ships were in the winter approaching and the distance from any known place of refreshment great  About two in the morning of the th we observed a great body of ice nearing us very fast and in a few hours after we saw the ice all closed as far  as the eye could carry bearing from N E to S W We continued to sail W S W  On the th several pieces of loose ice passed us one of which came soul of the Discovery and shook her whole frame it was feared she had received considerable damage but upon the carpenters examining her sore and aft nothing was found amiss We now took leave of the ice for this season directing our course S S W  On the th we saw land in the morning which bore from N N W to S W very high and covered with snow At two P M we were in with the land It showed itself in two hills like islands but afterwards seemed connected and appeared in every respect like the opposite coast of America In the low ground lying between the high land and the sea was a lake extending to the S E farther than we could see  The th at two A M bore away E by S At seven saw land the extreme of which bore S E At two P M saw more land trending to the southward At this time came in sight of a narrow channel that seemed to lead to the lake which we had seen the day before H  led our wind and stood N E by E In the evening we were in with the land and not a shrub to be seen but birds innumerable chiefly sea parrots  On the st at daylight we came in sight of the eastern cape named  Cape North  bearing S S E very high and covered with snow we were then distant from the nearest shore four or five leagues Continued our course from S S E to S E by E At noon the extreme of the southward point bore S W by S At three P M we saw two small but very high islands bearing from N N E to N W which we left to the northward We were then in lat and  long At night both ships tacked to the westward This day we passed an island to which Capt Cook gave the name of Burney's Island  Sept we continued coasting to the eastward as the land trended distance about four miles from the shore Here Capt Cook took occasion to fix the Eastern point of the Asiatic Continent It shews he says a steep rocky cliff facing the sea and lies in the lat and long  On the d we continued coasting along shore Course all day S S E Saw many very high trees supposed to be pines  On the d we opened into the great bay called the bay of St Lawrence where we anchored the th of last month but what was remarkable none of the inhabitants whom we had visited offered to approach us though the weather was favourable  On the th stood W N W right in for the land At six A M bore away S ½ W the easternmost point of land bearing S by E distance six or seven leagues and so continued all day At night stood E N E  On the th we lost sight of the main continent of Asia which we left the day before Lat long  On the th we saw land from W N W to E N E very woody and covered with snow in the vallies Here we found ourselves in sight of SledgeIsland near the continent of America and here Capt Cook was desirous of discovering the island of Alaschkska which the Russians had described as abounding with wood and water  On the th there came two canoes from the shore with four Indians in them though we were distant full four leagues We hove to for their  coming up but when alongside they had little or nothing to part with except some dried fish They were invited on board but could not be persuaded to enter The Captain made them presents of some trifles with which they departed well pleased They were clothed in skins after the manner of all the inhabitants of the Western coasts of America among whom we found a remarkable uniformity of dress and colour  On the th we steered E ½ N passing several bays and fine harbours all day found the country pleasant and the coast delightful Lat long beyond which the coast took a more Northerly course Here we found a strong current to set to the S E at the rate of five knots an hour  On the th at five A M land appeared from S E to E like two islands but after fatigueing trials we found them join to the main land At four P M the land opened all round from one shore to the other and we found ourselves in the middle of a deep bay but very shallow sometimes three but never above five fathoms and a half water At this time a headland on the West shore distinguished by the name of  Bald Head  lay N by W one league distant We saw the bay to run as far as the eye could carry but impossible to proceed as in many places the water shallowed under three fathom We stood off and on all night  On the th having a stiff breeze we ran right across the mouth of the bay for the N W shore and just before night the Resolution narrowly escaped running upon a rock This day Capt Cook landed on a narrow border of land which joined to the beech and which was covered with grass and heath with a variety of wild berries  but rather overripe He observed traces of foxes and deer upon the beech but none were caught on each side of this peninsula the coast forms a bay The projecting point of this peninsula obtained the name of  Cape Denbeigh  Several natives were seen on the peninsula and one came off to whom Capt Cook gave a knife and asked him for something to eat The man paddled off and meeting with another man with two dried salmon in his canoe took them from him and brought them to the Captain  On the th we came to anchor in six fathom water distance from the shore about four miles the Easternmost point of the bay bearing N E by E distance about eight miles very high land In the night we saw several fires but no Indians came off to us  On the th in the morning the boats from both ships were sent on shore where they saw some houses of a wretched construction a small sledge and several other articles belonging to the Indians but none of the natives About ten they returned with a load of wood which they found drifted on the beech but no water the wood had drifted from the Southward for we saw no trees but black spruce We then stretched over to the other shore and the boats were again sent out and about nine in the evening returned loaded with wood which the men were obliged to carry through the water on their shoulders as the boats could not come within half a mile of land for breakers This was a grievous task as many of them but just recovered their late illness This day several natives came from the S S E side in large canoes having great quantities of salmon dried and fresh which they exchanged for blue and red beads needles pins knives or scissars  or any European trinkets that were offered them but what they valued most was  tobacco  For this they would exchange their bows and arrows their warlike instruments and whatever else they valued most but of this commodity as has already been noticed we had but little to spare We were again obliged to change our station and stretch to the other shore where a safe anchorage was discovered near which we could get wood and water with the greatest ease We now stood more to the Southward in order to avoid those breakers we so narrowly escaped before and next day our great cutter was sent out properly provided with a compass and six days provision to survey the bay with a view to determine whether that land to which the Russians have given the name of Alaskah joined to the American continent or whether there was not a passage through the bay to the Northward While the cutters were on this service the boats continued wooding and watering and before the return of the former the latter had got the full complement of both on board and the ships were in readiness to depart  The th cast anchor in four fathoms and a half water within a mile and a half from the mouth of a great river from whence before night we had got more than tons of water we had likewise got a considerable quantity of wood from the shore This day a family of the natives came near the place where we were taking off the wood miserable looking objects who for four knives made out of an iron hoop parted with more than lb weight of fish which they had caught this and the preceding day  On the th the men had leave to go ashore by turns to gather berries which they now found ripe and in great abundance such as rasberries  blueberries black and red currants huckle berries with various other sorts all in full perfection A party was likewise sent out to cut spruce to brew into beer for both ships Of this liquor however the men were not very fond in this cold climate especially when they were given to understand that their grog was to be stopped and this beer substituted in the room of it This occasioned great murmuring and it was found necessary to give it alternately spruce one day and grog another  On their excursions the parties were always well armed and had marines to attend them and their orders were never to go out of hearing of the ships guns but to repair instantly on board on the proper signals These precautions however seemed unnecessary as they never met with any molestation from the natives who were not numerous upon the coast  On the th the party that were sent out to survey the bay returned after a diligent examination of two days and two nights Their report was that from the elevated spot from which they had taken their survey they could see the inlet terminate in a considerable river which emptied itself into the sea at the head of the bay that in its course it watered many most delightful vallies which were bounded on every side with hills of a moderate height interspersed with mountains or a stupendous height This report being confirmed by the officers who commanded the cutters from both ships the boats were all taken on board and secured and wood and water having been plentifully supplied the bay and sound examined and the exact situation determined to be lat and long there remained nothing but to name the sound and take our leave  In honour of Sir Fletcher Norton then Speaker of the House of Commons to whom Lieut King had the honour to be nearly related it was named Norton Sound called by the natives Chacktoole  On the th we weighed and sailed retracing Beering's Straits which we had before explored without any material accident though we found the water to shallow insomuch that we were forced to abandon the thoughts of passing between Besborough Island and the main to more than six miles distance  On the th shoal water obliged us to haul to the Westward by which the whole coast from to remains unexplored within which from several indications it should seem that a considerable river runs into the sea  On the th about two P M we came in sight of land which appeared like two islands Lat and at six in the evening came up with it but found both islands in one without either bush or tree Course S W  On the st saw a great number of islands but they too when we approached them appeared all in one Lat Course S S W  On the th we met with a dreadful tempest of wind rain and hail or rather ice between two and three inches square by which several of our men who were obliged to keep the deck were severely wounded In this long run we passed several remarkable promontaries and islands particularly in lat N we passed two headlands distance from each other about half a mile We hoveto and our boats sounded across in some places not above one fathom and a half In lat we came in sight of a cluster of islands as we imagined but on our nearer approach found them all in one barren and without a  shrub or tree In lat we came up with a stupendous rock or high island almost covered with snow and without any other inhabitants except birds and seals to this last Capt Cook gave the name of Winter Island from its dreary appearance  On the th the Resolution made the signal of distress On hailing her we were informed that she had again sprung a leak in the late violent gale and that all hands were employed at the pumps and in baleing and that it was with difficulty they could keep her above water Lat  On the th we were again visited with a severe storm and involved in heavy seas our hull being sometimes entirely under water and the waves rising to the yardarms About midnight it came on to snow and the Resolution kept making signals and firing guns all night At daylight we saw her distant five or six miles We shortened sail and waited for her coming up And  On the th being both in company the storm abated and the sea quite calm both ships hoveto and while the carpenters were employed in stopping the leak in the Resolution the people were busied in fishing Those on board the Discovery caught large cod besides turbot which were the more acceptable to officers and men as our salt provisions were now very bad Lat N  On the st of October we continued our course to the Southward Lat obs And  On the d about five in the morning we made land and hauled our wind in search of Samganoodo Harbour on the island of Oomalashka of which we had mistaken the entrance About six in the evening we came in sight of a large Indian  town in a deep bay where we found ourselves surrounded with whales of a prodigious size We sounded and found no bottom at fathoms Here some of our former friends came off to us and being informed that our design was to anchor in our late harbour they undertook to be our pilots and one of them slept all night on board the Discovery  On the d in the morning we found ourselves right abreast the Race and saw the Resolution just within the entrance About two in the afternoon the wind and tide both uniting in our favour we safely anchored in our late birth  All hands were now set to work the carpenters in stripping the sheathing from the Resolution to examine her leaks and the sailmakers caulkers and riggers in their respective employments for which there was great need both ships having suffered much in their sails seams and rigging in the late tempestuous weather and in the icy Northern seas but what gave the greatest pleasure to the seamen was the success they met with in fishing whenever the weather was such as to suffer them to haul the seine At the mouth of the harbour they could at any time in three or four hours fill their boats with holybut of an enormous size one of them sent on board the Resolution during our stay weighed lbEach mess had now a small cask with a quantity of salt given them in order to make some provision to help out their short allowance which it was found necessary to continue till their arrival in the tropical islands where the ships might again be furnished with a frefh supply  On the th our Captain went on board the Commodore where he was acquainted by Capt Cook with the distress of the Resolution which  ever since the hard gale on the th had been ready to founder on that day on sounding the pumps three feet water were found in the well and judging the leak to proceed from the same place as before the carpenters were employed in search of it when to their great surprize they found the full casks afloat and great quantities of provisions utterly spoilt Their first care was to skuttle the bulkheads and to let the water down into the hold and then the pumps were kept constantly at work to pump it out but this was beyond their power they could gain but little with incessant labour and when they came into harbour had inches still in the hold The carpenters had already stript the sides of the Resolution feet from the counter forwards where they found the inside timbers so much decayed that their report was if their continuance at sea had been necessarily protracted a fortnight longer she must have gone to the bottom  We had still much to do our articles for the tropical trade were nearly all exchanged and we could expect no supplies of provisions without an equivalent We therefore sent a small spare bower anchor on shore and set our armourers to break it up and make it into spikes axes hatchets nails and other tropical merchandize  While every thing was getting ready the officers diverted themselves as usual with shooting and surveying the country and here they found amusement enough having discovered a Russian settlement divided only by a neck of land about miles over and a bay of about  miles which they had to cross From this settlement Capt Cook received a very singular pre+sent It was a ryeloaf or rather a pye inclosing some salmon very nicely seasoned The man who  brought it was named Derramoushk and brought likewise a present for Capt Clerke These came from some Russian gentlemen settled in that neighbourhood In return some bottles of rum wine and porter were sent back by the same hand and Corporal Lediard of the marines a very intelligent person sent to gain information who soon returned with three Russian seamen and furriers who when they first discovered us at a distance from the shore were apprehensive that we were Japanese with whom their nation was at war but on our nearer approach they were convinced from the trim of our ships that we were strangers they were therefore encouraged by the report of the natives to make themselves known and to offer their assistance as far as lay in their power These were received with open arms generously entertained and a very friendly intercourse established  The road across the neck of land was rather rugged but when that was surmounted the communication was easy Some of our gentlemen who went to return the visit were met by an officer who received them politely and directed them to the factory where besides the fort they found a Russian bark of about or tons eight small swivels and one three pounder laid up for the winter and intended for Kamsha  ska the ensuing summer Our gentlemen were here shewn the stores belonging to the factory consisting of skins and oil their coppers for boiling the oil with the small ware with which they trafficked with the natives by way of exchange Iron instruments of war are prohibited nor do they suffer any offensive weapons of any kind to be introduced among them It is probable therefore that the long knives we saw in the possession of the more southerly Indians were some that were  taken from those unfortunate Russians who on the first discovery of this continent fell a sacrifice to the savage barbarity of the natives It was a little unfortunate that we had not one person on board either ship that had the most distant knowledge of the Russ language every thing was to be understood by signs Our officers could just make out that a Russian Captain had been murdered by the natives and that the Russians had taken a severe revenge and had laid the country under contribution and obliged the inhabitants to pay a certain annual tribute in skins but to what extent they had subdued the country or in what year they could not at all understand They learnt that the name of the island was NooOonalashkah in lat long E of Greenwich that they had another settlement to the Southward and other vessels that were constantly employed in trading with the natives and collecting their skins and oil that the factory was supposed to clear about rubles annually by this trade and that it was increasing that their only guard consisted of about Kamshatskadale Russians and natives over whom they were obliged to keep a watchful eye Our gentlemen's entertainment there was rather friendly than sumptuous they had dried venison dried salmon and great variety of other fish dressed after the Russian manner their biscuit was black and their bread rye their butter not extraordinary their wine and brandy the Indians who conducted the gentlemen earned from the ships with which the Russian officers made very free The evening being spent in mutual enquiries by which neither side could receive much satisfaction they were shewn to the apartments prepared for them where they slept undisturbed  In the morning they renewed their enquiries and the Russians by exhibiting the chart of their discoveries and conquests gave our gentlemen more satisfactory information than they could otherwise have obtained They observed a remarkable conformity between those charts exhibited by the Russians as far as they went and their own The Russian discoveries extended from the th to the th degree of Northern latitude by which the impracticability which we had discovered of a Northwest passage by any strait or sound was fully confirmed  They were now equally communicative to each other the Russian gentlemen were desirous of knowing the names of the navigators and ships with the expedition they were engaged in and they were invited on board to receive further information To this they readily agreed and as soon as our gentlemen had satisfied their curiosity had visited the Russian houses which were built with timber and those of the natives built with poles and earth had remarked the simplicity of the latter which seemed but one degree above the level of the beavers they hunted and of the former that was little more than a degree above those of the natives they set out upon their return to the ships accompanied by the Russian gentlemen by whom they had been entertained  About five in the evening they all came on board the Resolution the Russian gentlemen were received by Capt Cook with that familiarity and politeness that was natural to him they were taken into the great cabin where both Captains with their principal officers and gentlemen were assembled to entertain them and where the bottle was pretty briskly pushed about  as that was the principal subject in which the strangers could bear a part Here they were interrogated as to the time generally taken up in making the voyage to Kamshatska which they answered by dividing the year into twelve parts and pointing to the two middlemost As the master of the vessel which lay at Aegoochskach was of the company he was asked at what time he expected to arrive at Kamshatska He answered about the th month meaning in July He was then requested to take letters with him to be forwarded to England through Russia should it so happen that he should arrive at that port before us This charge he readily undertook and being pretty well plied with liquor they slept on board the Resolution and next day came on board the Discovery where they dined and being amply supplied with grog went jovially away in the afternoon  Before our departure we were visited by the Principal of the Russian factory whose name was Erasim Gergorioffzin Izmyloff He came from the Southward accompanied by a number of Indian canoes laden with skins who on coming ashore in the harbour instantly began erecting a tent which in half an hour they finished covering it with skins He was received on board the Resolution with the respect due to his rank and by his deportment it was easy to perceive that he was of family He was a young gentleman of a fair complexion and graceful stature and though differing but little in point of dress from those by whom we had been visited before he was notwithstanding very different in his manners and behaviour He had travelled much but chiefly in these savage countries and in the Northern parts of Asia and understood and could talk the  language of the natives but could speak no European language except his own He was handsomely entertained on board both ships and had every attention paid him that in our situation he had reason to expect nor was he insensible of our civilities He wrote a letter directed to the Governor of Kamshatska which he requested Capt Cook to deliver It contained as we afterwards understood a detail of his own mercantile affairs and a representation of us as trading with the Indians He told us that his residence was on the coast off which he had received a note in a little box and that he was the person who wrote that note and sent it Some presents reciprocally passed those on his part were cloaks and skins on ours tobacco and spirituous liquors of both which we observed the Russians to be immoderately fond  After sleeping on board the ships two nights and observing with an attentive eye the different employments of the artificers and examining the various conveniencies and accommodations which we had on board he took his leave on the th intending to make some stay at the settlement of Egooschac which the gentlemen of the Resolution had just visited  From this gentleman Capt Cook received much useful information He had some excellent maps and charts of the Northern coasts and islands which never had been published but which had every mark of authenticity He said there were only two harbours on the peninsula of Kamtschatka that were fit to receive ships of burden the bay of Awatska and the river Olutora as to the many islands to the North of Kamtschatka lying between that and the coasts of America which had found place in former maps  were wholly omitted and others added by which the Captain was enabled to compleat his own From the information given by this gentleman we have been able to correct our own map prefixed to this voyage with respect to the situation of islands between the Bay of Awatska and the country of Alascha the name by which the continent of this part of America is known to the Russians and called by the natives  There are it seems Russians settled on all the principal islands between Oonalashka and Kamtschatka for the purpose of collecting furs Their great object is the seabeaver or otter The natives are a quiet inoffensive people and for honesty might serve as an example to the most enlightened people upon earth The latitude of Saganoodha harbour is longitude  On the th the repairs of both ships being compleated and the wind coming fair to the Southward we unmoored and were preparing to sail when the Resolution on clearing the harbour run upon a rock and it was feared had received much damage as at low water she swayed inches and it was twelve at night before she was disengaged This necessarily retarded our departure and happily it was that we were got safe into harbour for a storm arose which tumbled the waters into the race with unexampled fury  On the th the wind abated and came fair to carry us to sea and the ship being found unhurt we weighed and having cleared the harbour made sail directing our course up the race to the N W At eight o'clock we were out of the race but still continued our course to the Westward when at midnight a heavy gale came on attended with snow and rain  On the th the gale still continuing to add to our labour we sprung a leak which kept us to the pumps till the storm abated While it was at the height it carried away our fore and maintacks and in endeavouring to save them John Mackintosh seaman was struck dead and the boatswain and four men were much wounded  On the th having lost sight of the Resolution in the heavy gale about three in the morning we heard her signal for wearing Lat  On the th about eight A M we again saw land supposed to be the island called Amoghta and by ten were in danger of perishing on a leeshore At eleven our people in taking in a reef of the foretopsail called out a ship under sail bearing N N W but on a nearer view found it an elevated rock covered with snow Lat long  On the th we were again within the race and at six in the evening passed the entrance of our harbour when five canoes made towards us but being now in full sail intending to leave the coast our leak not being found dangerous they were unable to overtake us nor did we think it of consequence to lie bye till they should come up  On the st we pursued our course to the Southward Lat  On the st of November we once more stood to the Southward after which no accident or any thing worth relating happened till our arrival on the coast of Owhye so called by the Russians and by Capt Cook Providence harbour except that on the th a cormorant was seen to fly several times round the Resolution which was the more noticed as those birds are never seen far from land and none was near  On the th being then in lat about six A M we came in sight of land bearing from S S W to N W very high and beautiful we were then so much in want of provisions that Capt Clerke much against his inclination was under the necessity of substituting stockfish in the room of beef but we were no sooner well in with the land than we were visited by many of the inhabitants who came off with their canoes with all sorts of provisions which their island afforded and every man on board had leave to purchase what he could for his own subsistence This diffused a joy among the mariners that is not easy to be expressed From a sullenness and discontent visible in every countenance the day before all was chearfulness mirth and jollity Fresh provisions and kind damsels are the sailors sole delight and when in possession of these past hardships are instantly forgotten even those whom the scurvy had attacked and had rendered pale and lifeless as ghosts brightened upon this occasion and for the moment appeared alert This flattering beginning however yielded no substantial relief The boats that were sent to sound the shore and to look for a harbour went out day after day without being able to discover so much as a safe anchorage and we were longer in finding a harbour than in making the coast Nothing could be more toilsome or distressing than our present situation within sight of land yet unable to reach it driven out to sea by one storm and in danger of being wrecked on the breakers by another At length after having examined the leeward side of the island Captain Cook made the signal to stand out to sea This was on the th of December when it was determined  to take a long stretch in order if possible to get round the S E extremity and to examine the weathermost side where we were told there was a safe harbour In this attempt we split our maintopmaststaysail and lost sight of the Resolution The weather continuing tempestuous for many days heavy complaints again prevailed among the ship's company Their sufferings from incessant labour and scanty provisions were grown confessedly grievous Their grog that had been stopped as soon as we arrived upon the coast was again dealt out to them as usual and it was with the kindest treatment from their officers that the men could be kept to their duty yet on Christmasday when each man was allowed a pint of brandy and free leave to enjoy himself as he liked not a murmur was heard they the very next day returned to business and continued it without repining till  The th of January when after a series of the most tempestuous weather that ever happened in that climate the boats from both ships were sent out to examine a fine bay where we were informed there was a harbour in which we might safely moor and where we should be supplied with materials to refit the ships and provisions to victual them In the evening the boats returned with the joyful news that they had succeeded in their search and that the harbour promised fair to answer all that had been said of it  On the th our boats were employed in towing the ships into harbour in sight of the greatest multitude of Indian spectators in canoes and on shore that we had ever seen assembled together in any part of our voyage It was concluded  that their number could not be less than or While we were hovering upon the coast we had often been visited by canoes at a time who came to trade and who brought us provisions when the weather would permit and besides provisions they brought us great quantities of cordage salt and other manufactures of the island which the Captains purchased for the use of the ships and without which we could not have subsisted for during the tempestuous weather our cordage snapped rope after rope so that our spare hands were incessantly employed night and day in knotting and splicing of which there was no end  This day before two o'clock P M we were safely moored in fathom water in company with the Resolution which a few days before we had given over for lost From the time of attempting to get round the island till the th of January we had never been able to get sight of her though both ships were constantly looking out to find each other They had suffered much in their masts and rigging and were happy at last as well as ourselves to find a convenient harbour to refit We were scarce moored when a young man of majestic appearance came along side and after an oration and the usual ceremonies of peace had passsed on both sides he came on board bringing with him a small barbecued hog some readydressed breadfruit and a curious mantle of red cloth as presents to the Captain and in return was complimented with several axes lookingglasses bracelets and other shewy articles that attracted his notice While he was busy in admiring every thing he saw on board the Discovery the pinnace was ordered out and he with his attendants were taken to Capt Cook where he  found another Chief of a still more graceful aspect named Kaneena All these were received with all possible respect In the mean time came in another Chief named Koah who was soon discovered to be a priest but who in his youth had been a distinguished warrior After entertaining them with music and inviting them to partake of such refreshments as the ship afforded and making them some handsome presents the Captain acquainted them with his wants by shewing them the condition of his ship and requesting a small portion of ground to land his materials and to erect his tents This request was readily granted at the same time giving the Captain to understand that the great King was absent that he had lately been at war with the King of the neighbouring island of Mawwhee that he was employed in settling the terms of peace and that in less than ten days he was expected home That they might notwithstanding land whatever they thought fit and that the ground they had occasion for should be marked out and taboo'd that is appropriated to their use without any of the natives being permitted to encroach upon it Both Captains very readily embraced the offer and prepared to accompany their benefactors to the town near which they wished to pitch their tents Upon their landing several vacant plats of ground were shewn them and when they had made their choice stakes were ordered to be driven at certain distances and a line to be carried round within which the common people were forbidden to enter under the severest penalties Matters being thus amicably settled no time was lost on our part to get every thing on shore The tents the armourer's forge the masts the sails the rigging the watercasks the bread the flour the powder  in short every article that wanted either to be reviewed or repaired were sent on shore and not the least interruption was given to the boats employed in the carriage or insult offered to the persons who conducted them On the contrary the Chiefs offered some empty houses that were conveniently situated near the new dock if that may be so termed where our artificers were set to work for the sick to lodge till their recovery No strangers were ever more hospitably received  On the morning after our people landed six large double canoes were seen entering the harbour at a great rate having not less than paddles to each canoe with upwards of Indians on board most of them naked Seeing them on their nearer approach making towards the ships the Captains ordered the guns to be shotted the marines to be drawn up and every man to be ready at his post the Indians assembled so fast that before noon the ships were surrounded with more than canoes in which there were not less than Indians They at first traded friendly having hogs in abundance and plenty of breadfruit plantains bananoes and whatever else the island produced but they had not been there long before a large stone was thrown in at the cabinwindow of the Discovery by an invisible hand A watch was instantly set and in less than half an hour another stone was thrown at the caulkers as they were at work on a stage on the ship's side The offender was seen and in sight of the Chiefs and the whole multitude he was seized brought on board tied to the shrouds and punished with fifty lashes In a few minutes such was their fright there was not an Indian to be seen near the shipsLike unlucky boys when one is apprehended for some naughty trick the rest  commonly fly the placeAnd in fact these people are in many respects like children and in none more than in this instance Before the day closed they all again returned to trade and when night approached not a male was to be seen but swarms of females who came to sleep on board though much against the will of Capt Cook who upon the first arrival of the ships upon the coast wished to have prohibited all commerce with the women of the island but he soon found that if that commerce was forbidden all other trade must cease of course for not a pig could be purchased unless a girl was permitted to bring it to market  There are who have blamed Capt Cook for his severity to the Indians but it was not to the Indians alone that he was severe in his discipline He never suffered any fault in his own people though ever so trivial to escape unpunished If they were charged with insulting an Indian or injuring him in his property if the fact was proved the offender was surely punished in sight of the Indians By this impartial distribution of justice the Indians themselves conceived so high an idea of his wisdom and his power too that they paid him the same honours as they did their Etua or Good Spirit  The caulkers who have already been mentioned when they came round in course to the afterpart of the Resolution found that besides the seams that wanted closing there were other more material defects The rudder's eyes were almost eaten through with rust and the bolts ready to tumble out This was an alarming defect and all other business was suspended till that was repaired  Every thing went on now as smoothly as could be wished The Chiefs if they saw any of their own people misbehave would themselves give information and bring them to punishment they were so very obliging that seeing us in want of wood to burn they made an offer of a high fence that surrounded the Morai adjoining to the town for a present supply  On the th being the fourth day after our arrival several very large canoes were seen to come from the S E We at first thought they were the friends with whom we had traded on the other side of the island but on their nearer approach we found they were all armed and clothed in the military uniform after their country manner This gave us cause to suspect some traiterous design but our fears were in some measure dissipated by the assurances we received from our friends on board that they were some of the warriors that had accompanied the King in his expedition against the Eree of Mawwee and that they were now returning home in triumph but notwithstanding this assurance it was thought prudent to be upon our guard and the rather as the women who were on board told us that their people designed to attack us and to mattee that is to kill us every one  Next day before nine in the morning more than a thousand Indians surrounded the Discovery insomuch that pressing their weight chiefly on one side the ship was in danger of being overset The Captain ordered two great guns to be fired in order to try what effect that would have in dispersing them In less than three minutes there were a thousand heads to be seen above water so many having jumped into the sea frighted on the sudden report of the guns neither did a single canoe come near us all the next day Some of the  women however remained on board who never could be prevailed on to shew themselves upon deck in the daytime but whether from fear of their own people or of the great guns we never could learn As all trade was now stopt and nothing brought on board for our subsistence Capt Cook went on shore to expostulate with the Chiefs and by some trifling presents to engage them to trade as before threatening at the same time to lay their towns waste if they refused to supply the ships with the provisions they stood in need of His remonstrances had the desired effect and next day we purchased not less than large hogs with great quantities of fruits and vegetables for the ships use  In a few days after this the old King Terreeoboo was seen to enter the harbour on his return from Mawwee In the afternoon he visited the ship in a private manner attended only by one canoe in which were his wife and children He staid on board till near ten at night when he returned to the village Kowrowa  The next day about noon the King in a large canoe attended by two others set out from the village and paddled towards the ships in great state Their appearance was grand and magnificent In the first canoe was Terreeoboo and his Chiefs dressed in their feathered cloaks and helmets and armed with long spears and daggers In the second came the venerable Kaoo the Chief of the Priests and his brethren with their idols displayed on red cloth These idols were busts of a gigantic size made of wickerwork and curiously covered with small feathers of various colours wrought in the same manner with their cloaks Their eyes were made of large pearl oysters with a black nut fixed in the centre their mouths were set with a  double row of the fangs of dogs and together with the rest of their features were strangely distorted The third canoe was filled with hogs and various sorts of vegetables As they went along the Priests in the centre canoe sung their hymns with great solemnity and after paddling round the ships instead of going on board as was expected they made towards the shore at the beach where our men were stationed On their approach the guard was instantly ordered out to receive the King and Capt Cook perceiving he was going on shore followed him and arrived nearly at the same time They were conducted into the tent where they had scarce been seated when the King rose up and in a very graceful manner threw over the Captain's shoulders the cloak he himself wore put a feathered helmet upon his head and a curious fan in his hand He also spread at his feet five or six other cloaks all exceedingly beautiful and of great value His attendants then brought four very large hogs with sugarcanes cocoanuts and bread fruit This part of the ceremony over they all made a circle round with their images in procession till they arrived at their Morai where they placed their deities and deposited their arms  Next day both Captains accompanied with several of their officers went to pay the King a visit on shore They were very respectfully received and having dined after the Indian manner the King rose and clothing Capt Cook with a mantle such as is worn by the great Oreno in grand procession he was conducted to the morai or place of worship where a garland of green plantain leaves was put upon his head and he was seated on a kind of throne and had the honour of exchanging names with the King the strongest  pledge of friendship these islanders can confer He was now addressed in a long oration by a priest clothed in a vestment of partycoloured cloth who concluded the solemnity with a choral hymn in which he was joined by all the priests present who had no sooner finished their song than they all fell at his feet the King acquainting him that this was now his building and that he was from henceforth their Orono From this time an Indian Priest was by the King's order placed at the head of his pinnace at whose approach the Indians in their canoes as he passed them prostrated themselves till he was out of sight and this they did when the Captain was alone but the Priests had orders from the King whenever the Captain came ashore in his pinnace to attend him and conduct him to his house which the sailors now called Cook's Altar  When all these solemnities were over we were not a little astonished to find in this King the same infirm emaciated old man that came on board Capt Cook when off the island of Mawee and it was soon discovered that he was then accompanied with the same persons viz his two younger sons one sixteen the other twelve with his nephew MaihaMacha a man of a most savage countenance  When we first approached the coast of this island of O why hee we were astonished at the sight of a mountain of a stupendous height whose head was covered with snow This was so rare a sight in an island between the tropics that several of the officers and gentlemen from both ships were desirous of taking a nearer view of it and for that purpose they requested the King's permission and a guide to attend them which was readily granted  and no less than ten Indians contended which should accompany them  On the th Mr Nelson our botanist and four other gentlemen set out in the morning on this expedition which they afterwards found attended with no small fatigue and not a little danger for after travelling two days and two nights and experiencing the greatest fatigue and hardships no water no paths to direct their way no inhabitants for many miles and the cold excessive as they approached the mountain which seemed covered with snow they were glad to get back without any accident In the course of their journey they were directed to the cottage of an old hermit who they said had formerly been a great warrior but who for several years past had retired to this sequestered spot He received them without any kind of emotion but would accept of nothing that they offered him He appeared by far the oldest man they had seen on the island  On the th they returned to the ships and the only advantage that accrued from their journey was a curious assortment of indigenous plants and some natural curiosities collected by Mr Nelson During their absence every thing remained quiet at the tents and the Indians supplied the ships with such quantities of provisions of all kinds that orders were given to purchase no more hogs in one day than could be killed salted and stowed away the next day This order was in consequence of a former order to purchase all that could be procured for seastock by which so many were brought on board that several of them died before they could be properly disposed of  It had been generally thought impracticable to cure the flesh of these animals in the tropical climates and it is believed that few trials had ever  been made before those of Capt Cook In his first voyage in he first made the attempt but not very successfully But it was now become absolutely necessary either to perfect the discovery or relinquish the voyage  The method we took was always to slaughter them in the afternoon and as soon as the hair was scalded off and the entrails removed the carcass was divided into pieces from four to eight pounds each and the bones of the chine and legs taken out and in the large sort the ribs also Every piece being then carefully wiped and examined that no bruise might escape and all the veins cleared out that no coagulated blood might remain they were then handed to the salters while the flesh was still warm After they had been well rubbed with salt they were then placed in a heap on a stage raised in the open air covered with planks and pressed with the heaviest weights we could lay on them In this situation they lay till the next evening when they were again well wiped and examined and the suspicious parts taken away They were then put into a tub of strong pickle where they were always looked over once or twice a day and if any piece had not taken salt which was readily discovered by the smell they were immediately taken out reexamined and the sound pieces put to fresh pickle and the other either used immediately or thrown away This however seldom happened After six days they were taken out examined for the last time and being again lightly pressed they were packed in barrels with a thin layer of salt between them Some of this pork was brought to England perfectly sweet and good  On the st of February William Watman gunner's mate died His body in the afternoon was carried on shore in the pinnace and  buried according to his own desire in the Morai belonging to the King The Indians who dug his grave about four feet deep covered the bottom of it with green leaves and when the corpse was deposited in the earth the Chiefs who attended the funeral put a barbecued hog at the head and another at the feet with a quantity of breadfruit plantains and bananas More was going to be added when Capt Cook ordered the grave to be covered up and a post erected to the memory of the deceased inscribed with his name the date of the year day of his death and the nation to which he belonged From this circumstance Capt Cook gave this port the name of Watman's Harbour The next day the Indians rolled large stones over his grave and brought two barbecued hogs plantains and bananas cocoanuts and breadfruit which they placed over his grave upon a stage erected for that purpose  We were now preparing to depart when our Captain was presented by the King with twelve large hogs three boatsload of breadfruit potatoes sugarcane and cocoanuts and the same present was made to Capt Cook  This day Feb the King came on board attended with twenty of his Chiefs and gave the Captains of both ships with their officers an invitation to an heiva in which many of the principal Chiefs were to be performers Capt Clerke excused himself from ill health but Capt Cook and the other Gentlemen promised to attend  The same day the King and his Chiefs dined on board the Resolution and were entertained with music the whole band having orders to play all the while they sat at dinner They were highly delighted with the music and would not suffer the performers to rest a moment  About four in the afternoon the pinnaces from both ships were ordered to be in readiness to take the company ashore with their pendants and colours displayed to do honour to a king and people by whom we had been so hospitably entertained More than canoes attended us to shore where a number of Chiefs were ready to receive us who ail observed a profound silence at our landing and conducted us to the place appointed for the entertainment But we were much disappointed by the performers who were far inferior to those of the Southern islands  The only part of the performance that was tolerable was their singing with which the heiva or play concluded the young princesses the chiefs and even the king himself joining in the chorus  The play being ended Capt Cook acquainted the King that with his permission he would exhibit some fireworks that if they did not frighten would very much astonish his people The King very readily gave his consent and the engineer was ordered to begin his exhibition as soon as it was dark On the rising of the first skyrocket the Indians fled precipitately and hid themselves in the houses or wherever they could find any shelter at first there were some thousand spectators but in less than ten minutes there were not fifty to be seen the King and his attendants excepted whom the Captain and the gentlemen with the greatest difficulty persuaded to stay When the second rose up in the air lamentations were heard from every quarter and when the waterrockets were played off the King and his Chiefs were hardly to be restrained Other fireworks it was found dangerous to exhibit as these had already struck the spectators the King as well as his people with a general panic We therefore took leave of  the King and Royal family and returned on board our respective ships The King having been made to understand that we should sail the first fair wind came next morning to visit the Captains of both ships who were now preparing to sail This being publicly known the Indians in general expressed their concern but particularly the young women whose lamentations were heard from every quarter  In the evening of the th of February all hands were mustered and none were missing  In the morning of the th we cleared the harbour shaping our course for Mawwee as we had been informed by the King that in that island there was a fine harbour and excellent water We had not been long under sail when the King who had omitted to take his leave of our Captain in the morning as not suspecting our departure so sudden came after the ships accompanied by the young prince his son in a sailing canoe bringing with them ten large hogs a great number of fowls and a small turtle a great rarity with breadfruit in abundance They also brought with them great quantities of cocoanuts plantains and sugarcanes  Besides other persons of condition who acompanied the King there was an old priest Kaoa who had always shewn a particular attachment to Capt Clerke and who had not been unrewarded for his civility It being rather late when they reached the ships they staid on board but a few hours and then all departed except the old priest and some girls who by the King's permission were suffered to remain on board till they should arrive at some of the neighbouring isles We were now steering with a fine breeze but just at the close of the evening to our great mortification  the wind died away and a great swell succeeding with a strong current setting right in for the shore we were in the utmost danger of being driven upon the rocks In the height of our distress and trouble the old priest who had been suffered to sleep in the great cabin leapt overboard unseen with a piece of silk the Captain's property and swam to shore  The next day seeing a large canoe between us and the shore we hoveto for her coming up and to our great surprize perceived the old King accompanied by several of his Chiefs having in their vessel the priest who had stolen the silk whom the King delivered to the Captain at the same time requesting that his fault might be forgiven The King being told that his request was granted unbound him and set him at liberty telling the Captain that seeing him with the silk he judged it was none of his own and therefore ordered him to be apprehended and had taken this method of exposing him for injuring his friend This singular instance of Indian generosity and justice ought not to be forgotten It appears however that this old priest who had changed names and was proud of being called  Bretanne  had slipt away from Mr Bligh master of the Resolution to whom he had pretended to discover a much more commodious harbour than that of Kakooa which they had just left As soon as they had delivered the silk which the Captain would have had the King to accept they departed and had scarce reached the shore when a heavy gale came on with thunder lightning and hard rain We wore ship and continued working off the land all night and soon lost sight of the Resolution who as well as the Discovery continued bea  ing about the island seven days successively in  dread every moment of being wrecked upon the coast On the fourth day after we had lost sight of the Resolution the storm being a little abated we observed her under a high part of the island lying with her foretopgallantmast down her foretopsailyard upon the cap and the sail furled which gave us reason to suppose that some accident had befallen her and as we expected so we found it We stood down for her with a heavy gale but it was not till next day that we could come to speak with her Capt Cook himself being upon deck when we came up informed us that he had sprung his foremast in two different places that the ship was leaky and that it was with the greatest difficulty they kept her above water He further said that on the th in the morning they discovered the leak that at that time they made thirty inches of water in three hours and that ever since all hands had been constantly employed night and day in baling and pumping we likewise understood that they had split their maintopsail and that they were now bound to our late harbour to repair their damage We pursued the same course but it was not till the th when we opened on the bay in which lay our port We were very soon surrounded with our old friends who brought us hogs breadfruit plantains bananoes and cocoanuts which they threw on board without waiting for any recompense We were likewise visited by the old King the Prince and many of the Chiefs who came to welcome us and who were seemingly glad of our return About ten in the morning both ships moored near their old birth and presently all hands were set to work to strip the mast and to carry it on shore to be repaired  The next day the King came again on board and mutual presents and mutual civilities were continued as usual but about five in the afternoon there came alongside a large canoe with about of their fighting men all armed with little or no provisions on board and who seemed to have no good design Our Captain observing their motions ordered the guns to be shotted and every man to his post About six they departed without offering the least insult but soon after we saw upon a high hill a large body assembled who were observed to be gathering stones and laying them in heaps At dark they were seen to disperse but great lights and fires were kept burning all night  In the morning of the th they again assembled and began rolling the stones from the brink of the hill in order as we supposed to divert our attention but which rather served to awaken our fears Our Captains looking upon this as an insult ordered the guns to be levelled and fired among them and in ten minutes there was not an Indian to be seen near the place  In the afternoon the King came on board the Resolution and complained to Capt Cook of our killing two of his people intimating at the same time that they had not the least intention of hurting us He continued on board some hours amusing himself with seeing the armourers at work and when he departed requested that they might be permitted to make him a Pahooa an instrument they use in battle when they come to close quarters which was readily granted  From this time forward the natives became very tumultuous and unruly and stole every thing they could lay their hands on with any tolerable chance of escaping They were fired upon but  that only enraged them One who had just stolen the armourer's tongs and an iron chisel with both which he was making to shore was intercepted by Capt Cook himself who with a few marines endeavoured to seize him as he was landing but the Indians seeing his design came rushing in a body to the waterside among whom the fellow found means to secrete himself and the multitude instead of delivering him up attacked the boats that were in pursuit of him seized their oars broke them and forced our whole party to retreat  Capt Cook having only a few marines with him part of those who were placed as a guard to the carpenters employed upon the mast did not think proper to renew the attack but returned to the tents ordering a strict watch to be kept during the night and his whole force to be kept under arms till the matter should be accommodated For this purpose Mr Edgar our master was sent with a message to the young prince who from the beginning had behaved friendly to acquaint him with the cause of the fray and to demand the delinquent to be delivered up The prince instead of listening to his remonstrances assumed another countenance and Mr Edgar was very roughly handled and glad to make his escape with a sound beating  The temper of the Indians was now totally changed and they became every day more and more troublesome  On the th a vast multitude of them were seen together making great lamentation and moving slowly along to the beating of a drum that scarce gave a stroke in a minute From this circumstance it was supposed they were burying the dead who had been killed the day before  No violence however was either done or attempted this day though the girls that were on board gave us to understand that their countrymen only waited a favourable opportunity to attack the ships  On the morning of the th our great cutter which was moored to the buoy was missing from her moorings and upon examination the boat's painter was found cut two fathoms from the buoy and the remainder of the rope gone with the boat  This gave cause to suspect that some villainy was concerting and in order to prevent the illconsequences that might follow both Captains met on board the Resolution to consult what was best to be done on this critical occasion The officers from both ships were present at this council where it was resolved to seize the King and to confine him on board till the boat should be returned  With this view early on the morning of the th Capt Cook with Mr Phillips Lieutenant of Marines and nine of his men went on shore under cover of the guns of both ships to one side of the bay where the King resided and Mr King second Lieutenant of the Resolution who had always been stationed with a guard to protect the working party and the waterers on shore went as usual to the other side The Indians observing our motions and seeing the ships warping towards the towns of which there were two one on each side the bay they concluded that our design was to seize their marine In consequence of which most of their large war canoes took the alarm and were making off when our guns loaded with grape and canister shot drove them back and the Captain and his guard landed without opposition We observed however that their warriors were clothed in their military dress  though without arms and that they were gathering together in a body from every direction their Chiefs assuming a very different countenance to what they usually wore upon all former occasions However Capt Cook attended by the Lieutenant of Marines a Serjeant and nine privates regardless of appearances proceeded directly to the King's residence where they found him seated on the ground with about twelve of his Chiefs round him who all prostrated themselves on seeing the Orono enter The Captain addressed the King in the mildest terms assuring him that no violence was intended against his person or any of his people except against those who had been guilty of a most unprecedented act of robbery by cutting from her moorings one of the ship's boats without which they could neither conveniently water the ships nor carry on the necessary communication with the shore calling upon the King at the same time to give orders for the boat to be immediately restored and inviting him in the most friendly manner to accompany him on board till his orders should be carried into execution The King protested his total ignorance of the theft said he was very ready to assist in discovering the thief and should be glad to see him punished and shewed no unwillingness himself to trust his person with the Orono though he had lately exercised very unusual severities against his people He was told that the tumultuous appearance of his people and their repeated robberies made some uncommon severities necessary but that not the least hurt should be done to the meanest inhabitant of his island by any person belonging to the ships without exemplary punishment and all that was necessary for the continuance of peace was to pledge himself for the  honesty of his people With that view and that view only the Captain said he came to request the King to place confidence in him and to make his ship his residence as the most effectual means of putting a stop to the robberies that were now daily and hourly committed and committing by his people both at the tents and on board the ships and were so daring as to become insufferable The King upon this remonstrance was preparing to comply and his two sons were actually on board the pinnace to accompany the Orono when a woman mother to the boys and a great favourite of the King's came after them and with many tears and entreaties besought them to come on shore and not to go on board the ships The Chiefs at the same time began to take the alarm but the good old King not yet suspecting or pretending not to suspect any treachery had made himself ready to accompany the Captain and was actually on his way but by this time the women and children were sent away and the men put on their war mats and armed themselves and so great a body of Indians were got together and had lined the shore that it was impossible they could break through the multitude who now began to behave outrageously and to insult the guard Capt Cook observing their behaviour gave orders to the officer of marines to make way and if any one opposed to fire upon and instantly dispatch him This order the Lieutenant endeavoured to carry into execution and a lane was made for the King and his Chiefs to get to the boats but they had scarce reached the waterside when the word was given that the Orono for so they called Capt Cook was about to carry off their King to kill him In an instant a number of their fighting men broke  from the crowd and with clubs and stones rushed in upon the guard four of whom were presently dispatched A ruffian making a stroke at Capt Cook was shot dead by the Captain himself who having a doublebarreled gun was aiming at another when a savage came behind him and striking him on the head with his club felled him to the ground and then thrust his pahooa through his body with such force that entering between his shoulders the point of it came out at his breast The quarrel now became general The guns from the ships began to pour in their fire upon the crowd and the musquetry from the boars but such was their intrepidity that contrary to all expectation they stood their ground and carried off in triumph the bodies of the dead  Besides Capt Cook whose death was universally deplored Corporal Thomas and three privates Hinkes Allen and Fadget fell victims to their fury and three more of the marines were desperately wounded Lieut Phillips who had received a wound between the shoulders with a pahooa shot the man dead who had wounded him just as he was going to repeat his blow it seemed as if it was against our Commodore that their vengeance was chiefly directed by whose order they supposed their king was to be forced on board and punished at his discretion Seeing him fall they set up a great shout and his body was instantly surrounded by the enemy who snatching the dagger out of each other's hands they shewed a savage eagerness to have a share in his destruction  Thus fell the greatest navigator that this or any other nation could boast the account of whose death was transmitted to England by Professor  depiction of the murder of Captain Cook at Hawaii  Representation of the Murder of Capt Cook at O'Whyee  Pallas from Petersburg long before the arrival of our journalist and with such circumstances of agreement in the principal facts as sufficiently prove the authenticity of both  The Professor says  "The inhabitants shewed Capt Cook during his first stay a respect that bordered on adoration but on his second landing they grew more thievish than before and at last the cutter belonging to the Discovery was cut loose and carried away The day after this happened the Captain with his Lieutenant and nine marines landed He went up to the residence of the chief Terreboo He was received with respect but he found a great crowd assembled with the chief Some of them grew insolent as he made his complaints one of them in particular indulged his grimaces in so provoking a manner that the Captain discharged at him the shot of his fowlingpiece On which a general commotion ensued The Lieutenant fired and killed one dead upon the spot but instead of dispersing they now made a general attack and though the marines fired one round with great effect the crowd was not intimidated but rushed on with such rapidity that there was no time to load again In the first onset Capt Cook and four of his people were unhappily killed upon the spot and it was with great difficulty that the Lieutenant and the remaining marines could make their retreat most of them wounded and it would have been almost impossible for them to have escaped had it not been for the fire from the pinnace and longboat that lay at some distance from the beach Capt Clerke saw no possibility of revenging the loss of his gallant countryman but with great slaughter he therefore  kept upon the defensive"  To return to our Journalist  The dead being past recovery the distressed situation of the living was now to be regarded The Resolution was without her mast and lay in a manner at the mercy of the savages who it was every moment expected would have cut away her moorings and drifted her on shore It was therefore the first care of Capt Clerke who succeeded to the command to order the mast to be floated away and to get the tents and all our other baggage on board For this purpose no time was to be lost While many of the natives lay dead upon the beach it was judged the properest time to take advantage of that interval of inactivity which always succeeds any considerable exertion of Indian ferocity Lieutenant King who as has been observed before commanded the workingparty on the other side the bay and who had cultivated a friendship with the priests whose dwellings were contiguous to the Morai was all this while ignorant of what was going forward but could not help being under inexpressible anxiety at seeing the extraordinary agitation by land and hearing the firing from the ships at sea and the boats near the shore but at the same time had assured the priests who were equally alarmed that whatever might be the matter they should be safe was not a little startled when just at that critical moment two great shot from the Discovery cut a tree in the middle under which some of them were sitting and split a piece from a rock in a direct line to their dwellings for Capt Clerke being under no less concern for Lieut King and those under his command and having no clue but appearances to go by had caused  the fire of the great guns to be directed to that quarter as soon as the natives were dispersed from the other Our whole force was therefore collected and having landed under cover of our guns we marched rapidly up the hill with bayonets fixed and took possession of the Morai which stood on elevated ground and gave us an advantage over the savages who could not approach us from the shore neither could they attack us from the towns without being exposed to our fire from the ships They made several unsuccessful attempts to dislodge us but were repulsed with loss After sustaining an unequal conflict for three hours in which several of them were killed without being able to make any impression on our small body and without our losing a man though several were much hurt by the stones from their slings they at length dispersed and left us masters of our tents and of all our other property  Our next care was to recover the bodies of our dead A strong party under Lieut King were sent out in the pinnaces and boats with a white flag in token of peace to endeavour to procure them They were met by Koah a Chief with whom Mr King was well acquainted and of note among the savages at the head of a vast multitude without at first answering our signal but Mr King commanding the armed boats to stop and going himself in a small boat alone with a white flag in his hand had the satisfaction to be instantly understood the men threw off their warmats the women returned to the beach and Koah shewed equal confidence by swimming off with a flag in his hand and on entering the boat where Mr King sat with as much unconcern as if nothing had happened being told  that they were come to demand the body of Capt Cook or to declare war if it was not instantly restored he assured the Lieutenant that he would go himself and procure it begged a piece of iron of him and joyfully swam on shore calling out to his countrymen that now we were all friends again but notwithstanding this Chief's dissembled friendship our men in the boats who had entered into parley with the natives were informed that the warriors were then on the back of the hill cutting up and dividing the bodies of the slain While we remained in our boats several other Chiefs came to the waterside and one in particular with Capt Cook's hanger which he drew in a vaunting manner and brandished it over his head others shewed themselves with the spoils taken from the dead one having a jacket another a shirt a third a pair of trowsers and so on insulting us as it were with the trophies of their victory  At this time it was thought prudent to stifle our resentment and to reserve our vengeance till a more favourable opportunity We were now in want of water our sails and rigging in a shattered condition our cordage bad and our repairs not near finished all therefore we had to do was to remain upon the defensive till we were better provided  At the close of the evening as soon as it was dark a canoe was heard paddling towards the Resolution in which were two men As it approached both sentinels fired but without hurting either of the men though the balls went through the bottom of the canoe Notwithstanding this the canoe came close under the ship's stern and one of the men calling out  Tinne Tinne  the name Mr King was known by whom the Priests had always  supposed to be the Orono's son and therefore the Earee of the ship this excited every one's curiosity and orders were given to admit them on board they were priests and produced a piece of flesh carefully wrapped up in a cloth which they solemnly assured us was part of the thigh of our late Commander that he saw it cut from the bone but believed that all the flesh of the body was burnt that the head and all the bones except what belonged to the trunk were in the possession of Terreoboo and the other Chiefs that what we saw had been brought to Kaoa the High Priest to be made use of in some religious ceremony and that he had sent it as a proof of the sincerity of his innocence and his friendship Being asked if any part of the flesh had been eaten they expressed the utmost horror at the idea They afterwards asked with some apparent apprehension when the Orono would come again and what he would do to them on his return The same question had been asked by others which shews the opinion they entertain of the spirit's power after it is separated from the body They then desired to be set at liberty which was granted One of the men was the Priest who had attended Capt Cook and who was ready on all occasions to fall down and worship him He lamented his loss with abundance of tears and earnestly besought us to keep their coming a secret for if it should be known it would prove fatal to their whole fraternity They farther informed us that of their countrymen were killed in the first action at Kowrowa of whom five were Chiefs and that Kaneena and his brother our particular friends were among the number eight they said were killed at the observatory of whom three were of the first rank As this was the fact  the story that was given out to conceal it may be worth relating  On the th says our journalist the father and mother of two girls who had concealed themselves on board the ship came in the dead of the night in their canoe loaded with cocoanuts and breadfruit which they had been gathering in the day for their own subsistence as a supply for their children lest from what had happened they should have been suffered to die for want acquainting us at the same time with a treacherous design of their countrymen to cut our cables and drift the ships ashore They were taken on board and detained prisoners till morning when not an Indian was to be seen near the harbour but such as were old and feeble and knew not how to make their escape The informers were tenderly treated had presents made them and were afterwards dismissed at their own desire upon a neighbouring island with every token of kindnessThe truth is the Priests had desired the guardboat to attend them lest they should have been fired at and interrupted by the guardboats of the other ship by which they might have been discovered and perhaps put to death  Among other incidents of the present day Feb there was one which could not be understood Two boys were seen swimming towards the ships singing as they approached the ships a mournful and plaintive song They had each a long spear in his hand which on boarding the Discovery they delivered to the Officer on the deck and then departed Who sent them or for what purpose we never could learn  On the th the different promotions took place and according to their succession the Officers changed ships Capt Clerke went on board  the Resolution and Mr Gore first Lieutenant of the Resolution took the command of the Discovery  On the th both ships were again warped near the shore and a spring put upon their cables in order to cover the boats which were sent to compleat our complement of water On this motion crowds of inhabitants were seen to assemble with a large black flag displayed which we interpreted as a signal for war but we afterwards found that it was part of their ceremony in burying their dead Under this mistake a few guns were fired from the ships to disperse them by which the King's nephew Maiha Maiha was wounded and a poor woman lost her arm This made a strong impression on the whole body of Indians and we were left in quiet both this and the next day to pursue our repairs and compleat our hold  On the th they began again to be troublesome In the morning while the boats were loading at the well the stones came about the watermen like hail some of them of more than a pound weight one in particular was seen coming but who threw it no one could tell This being attended to a native was observed to creep out of a cavern who as soon as he had discharged his stone retired back to his place of shelter Him we marked and returned to our ships and it being now apparent that nothing was to be gained by fair means orders were given to strike terror among them by pursuing them with fire and sword About two in the afternoon all who were able to bear arms as well sailors and artificers as marines were mustered and preparations made to sustain them while with lighted torches they rowed on shore and set fire to the S E town pursuing the frighted inhabitants while their  houses were in flames with unrelenting fury Many were put to death and all driven to seek shelter where they could scarce a house having escaped the general conflagration In this vindictive enterprize the cavern or hole of the crafty Indian whose insolence had been one principal cause of the desolation that followed was not forgotten His cavern had been marked as has already been observed and on seeing our sailors approach it such was his inveteracy that he heaved a huge stone at the assailants one of whom he dangerously wounded but was instantly dispatched by the discharge of three muskets and a bayonet run through his body Our vengeance being now fully executed we returned to the ships loaded with the spoils of the towns consisting of bows and arrows clubs and arms of all kinds which they use in battle and having the heads of two of their fighting men of which the courageous native was one stuck at the bows of the pinnaces as a terror to the enemy from ever daring again to molest us  About four in the afternoon of the th ten girls came down to the well where the waterers were busy with quantities of fruit as much as they could carry for which they would take nothing in return only praying to be taken on board This was denied them as peremptory orders had been given by Capt Clerke forbidding the admission of any more of their women  This day in the morning a Chief was seen coming down the hill followed by a number of boys with a white flag displayed and carrying boughs and green branches in their hands They came singing to the water side but that did not prevent their receiving the fire of a party that was placed as a guard On seeing his ensign answered  by a white flag at each mizentopmasthead he accompanied with three other Chiefs came on board having some cocoanuts plantains and breadfruit as presents to the Commander for which they would accept of nothing in return This Chief whose name was Eappo came to make submission and as a token of his sincerity promised to collect the bones of our deceased warrior as he called him and to bring them and lay them at our feet This was the token of the most perfect submission that a native warrior could make to his conqueror and this was accepted on the part of our Commander In this manner and on these conditions peace was to be restored  At nine in the morning of the next day the same old Chief returned attended by a more numerous suit than before having several large hogs added to his peaceofferings and with him likewise he brought the bones of Capt Cook his backbone and the bones of his feet only excepted which he promised to produce the next visit he made On examination the head appeared to have been scalped the face was entirely gone the hands had the flesh on but scored and salted and as he assured the Captain most of the flesh besides was burnt Our Commander made signs to return the cutter but was told it was broke up and burnt for the iron The arms belonging to the marines who were killed were next demanded but these it was said were carried up the country by common people and were irrecoverable Some presents were made to this friendly Chief who departed well satisfied We were now preparing to depart when provisions of all sorts came pouring in upon us faster than we could consume them The Chief kept his promise and  On the d Eappo and the King's son came on board and brought the bones of the Captain that were missing these were all placed in due form in a case made for the purpose and under a triple discharge from the ships buried in the bay The terror of the natives on this occasion was increased by a four pound ball being loaded by mistake which fortunately did no other mischief than that of exciting the jealousy of the natives that our professions of peace were not sincere which possibly might be the case with him who loaded the gun as the sailors in general could hardly be restrained from violence whenever a native came within their power Nothing more remained now to be done  This day we had the satisfaction of getting the foremast of the Resolution shipt which was a work of great labour and some difficulty as the ropes were now become rotten and unable to sustain the purchase however that being at length accomplished and the repairs compleated so far at least as our circumstances would allow we bent our sails in the morning and were visited by many of our former friends among whom was the King's youngest son a boy of about fourteen years of age of whom Capt Cook was remarkably fond and the boy in return was no less attached to the Captain He came to express his sorrow for the accident that had happened which he did by a plentiful flow of tears He gave us to understand that his two brothers were killed and that his father was retired to an inaccessible place Capt Clerke made him some presents that were pleasing to him and he departed very much comforted  About in the evening a breeze springing up in our favour we unmoored and soon left  Karakakooa Bay for that was the name of the bay in which we had been moored shaping our course to the N W Nothing remarkable till  The th when we opened upon a fine bay in one of the Leeward Islands called by the inhabitants Oaaah where the ships came to an anchor and where both Captains landed they found a fine running river but brackish towards the sea they therefore made a very short stay Several of the inhabitants came on board who were so immoderately fond of iron that they endeavoured to wrench the very ringbolts from the hatches Here we put ashore the family that accompanied us from Owhye and here we purchased a few small swine some breadfruit and plantains and a quantity of a root called Taee not unlike fernroot but of an enormous size some weighing from to pounds It is a powerful antiscorbutic of the saccharine kind Pounded we made an excellent liquor from it very pleasant and exceedingly wholesome We had quantities of it when we reached Kamshatska and as good as when first purchased Having found nothing else to engage our attention in this island we set sail in the evening and  Next day March about noon we moored in our old birth which notwithstanding had a most beautiful appearance from the sea being well cultivated and full of villages We made sail in the evening for Atooi where we had anchored the preceding summer We learned that the name of the island we had just left was Woahoo lat N long E Here we were received with seeming coolness Hogs and the produce of the island were brought us indeed in abundance but when our casks were landed in order to exchange our water that of Owhyhe  being both bitter and brackish and the water here excellent the coopers were no sooner set to work than one native snatched up an adze another a bucket a third a bag of nails and so on and this among a crowd of people of more than four or five hundred in number To put a stop to these depredations orders were given to fire over their heads but this not having the desired effect a gun from the ships threw them all into confusion Two were seen to drop and by the shrieks and cries of the women more were supposed to have been killed or wounded For a while the multitude retreated but being rallied by some of their Chiefs who doubtless had heard that we were not invulnerable they returned in greater numbers than before when it was thought prudent to lay aside watering and to provide for our own safety All hands were now ordered to their posts and an engagement commenced in earnest when the Indians instantly gave way after a few being killed and wounded by our fire and they never again offered the least violence during our stay A perfect agreement took place and presents were mutually exchanged on both sides  The reason assigned for our cold reception at first was because we had introduced among their women a bad disorder when at that harbour before of which many of their people had diedBut now peace being established all the bad water was started from both ships and a plentiful stock of good water taken on board to serve us during our long run to Kamshatska for which we were preparing Here one of the Chiefs named Noooha expressed a desire to accompany us in our voyage when being told that we were never more to return to that island he lamented the opportunity  he had lost when we were here before and pointing to the sun seemed to suppose that we should visit that luminary in our course and that the thunder and lightning of our guns and that which came from above were both derived from the same source  Before our departure an Indian brought on board our ship a piece of iron to be fashioned into a podooa which upon examination appeared to be the bolt of some large piece of ship timbers larger than any that our ships could produce This excited the curiosity of the officers on board but no farther discovery could be made but that it had been taken from a part of a large ship that had been drifted on the coast since our leaving the island in It was of a paler colour than our iron but of what nation we were unable to discover  From this harbour we sailed on the th and visited the opposite side of the island where we had likewise passed a part of the former winter Here we were received with much kindness and hospitality and here we purchased yams and potatoes for our summer's consumption which the companies of both ships were glad to accept in exchange for their allowance of bread that part of their food being both scanty and bad  Besides the natural productions of the country we purchased in these islands many tons of salt much of their cordage and cloth and a great variety of artificial curiosities such as their weapons of war their instruments for fishing their cloaks and coverlets their caps masks nets instruments of music their needles thread working tools bracelets earjewels and in short almost every thing that was new to us or which was peculiar to them among which were some household  utensils and prints for impressing their cloth The island we are now preparing to leave is named Oneeheow and lies in lat N and in long E from London nearly  On the th we made sail and soon after were informed that Capt Clerke was taken ill We at first stood to the Westward veering a little to the South in search of a small island named Modoo Pappapa which we were told abounded in turtle We continued this course till  The th when we were in lat N long per watch We now altered our course and steered N W  April we continued steering N W ½ W lat N long  On the d we crossed the Northern Tropic long E steering N W by N in a direct course for Kamshatska On the d day after leaving the island of Oneeheow it began to blow a hard gale which continued with very little intermission to the present day when our ship became very leaky and we were informed that the Resolution was much worse than the Discovery  On the th for the first time since our leaving Oneeheow or Nehu as the sailors called it we had an observation and found ourselves in lat long E  On the th we observed a tropic bird hovering about the ship and by her motions we expected her to light being far to the Northward of her proper climate however she left us and made for the Resolution In the evening it began to blow with heavy rain and continued an unremitting gale till  The th when we were in lat very cold and foggy As we now began to approach the higher Northern latitudes the flannel jackets  that had been stored up while we were among the tropical islands were again brought into use and were of infinite service to the poor men We now altered our course to the Eastward having great signs of land on our larboard beam  On the th being in lat the signs of land increased The weather being fine and clear we seized this opportunity to search for the leak and knowing it to be forwards we moved the sails from the fore sailroom and found them wringing wet but the leak was out of our reach however when the weather was fine it gave us very little trouble  On the th the Resolution's boat came on board and Capt Gore and our first Lieutenant went to visit Capt Clerke who still continued very ill On their return they brought a dismal account of the condition of the Resolution she became leaky on the th when it blew a tempest On the carpenters going down to the cockpit for lights they were alarmed by finding themselves over their shoes in water and upon further examination the casks in the fishroom and spiritroom were driving one against another by which two casks of French brandy were staved They then searched forwards where they found the coalhole six feet deep in water and the ship's whole complement of paint destroyed several casks of shells and curiosities staved the lightroom deck blown up and the bulkhead between the gunner's storeroom and the coalhole burst open In this alarming situation they continued during the whole time that this stormy weather lasted pumping night and day and every officer in the ship the Captain who was ill only excepted took his turn with the common men who were sickening apace with fatigue nor were  they then relieved from hard duty when our gentlemen left the ship which was the reason we could make no stay to examine the extent of De Gama's or Company's Land which however we discovered by our run not to extend farther to the Eastward than it is marked in our ordinary maps The misfortune of the Resolution's people did not end with the damages above recited much of their bread was spoiled and they were forced to take from us a ton of yams to supply its place  On the th we lost sight of the Resolution but by every appearance were at no great distance from land Large pieces of timber drifted by us and land birds innumerable were seen to the Westward We were now in lat and our long running at the rate of seven or eight knots an hour  On the th we came in sight of the Resolution and though it blew hard they threw out the signal for us to make sail from whence we concluded that the leak still distressed them At noon we were in lat and long  On the th we had a deep snow attended with frost by which our men were exposed to incredible hardships It fell so heavy upon the decks and rigging that it was next to impossible to keep them clear or not being clear to make the ropes traverse Fortunately it ceased freezing in the night  On the st we were in lat when we began to get every thing in readiness for coming to anchor  On the d we were in the latitude of London the water of a milky colour but no soundings at eightyfive fathom In the evening the Resolution made the signal to tack ship and we  never afterwards saw her till our arrival at our destined harbour  On the d we came in sight of land very barren very rugged and covered with snow from whence we were distant not above a league with our starboard tacks on board the water near the shore black with wild fowl and a sheet of ice skirting the land covered with sealions seals and other amphibious animals At half past ten P M we were put about finding by our logbook and watch that we were fifty miles to leeward of our port  On the th we were out of sight of land with a heavy gale a fall of snow piercing cold and twenty of our hands frostnipped  The th it blew hard from the N E We kept working to windward which doubled our labour and our concern for our Commodore increased so much the more as we judged by our own sufferings what must be the fate of the Resolution that was much less able to struggle with the storm than the Discovery The storm continuing with sleet and snow three men could scarce do the work of one  Amidst these complicated distresses our leak increased to an alarming degree  On the th we made inches in three hours The wind dying away we tried the current and found we drifted half a mile an hour to the Southward A man was sent up to the masthead to look round for the Resolution but without succeeding We now gave her over for lost  On the th we stood in for the land and at two in the afternoon we came in sight of the entrance of the bay of Kamshatska then distant between seven and eight miles to the Southward We made sail and stood right in but finding it froze  over we judged that the Resolution could not possibly be there and therefore concluded that she must have gone to the bottom  Early next morning we once more attempted the entrance of the bay and finding the ice drifted we conceived hopes that we might be able to force a passage through the loose ice which now the weather was fine did not appear so formidable as before About noon a pleasant breeze sprung up and we directed our course to a flag we saw displayed just within the bay and happily succeeded drooping our anchor in twenty fathom water within less than three leagues of our intended harbour In about half an hour while our boats were still looking out for a passage we observed at a distance two boats making towards us one of which we knew to belong to the Resolution the other belonged to the Russians No joy could exceed that which the certainty of the safety of the Resolution spread through the whole ship's company of the Discovery She had been in port ever since the th and had given us over for lost never expecting to see us more She had met with some damage in her sails and rigging but by her fortunately hitting the harbour she had escaped much of the distress that we suffered from the severity of the weather  Early on the first of May we weighed having the Resolution's boat to direct us Soon after daylight we were within the lighthouse near the entrance of the harbour but were opposed by a strong tide from the shore which drifting huge pieces of floating ice against us made our further progress both dangerous and fatiguing but having the wind fair about five in the evening we came to in sight of the town and soon after dropt anchor near the Resolution  On the d the Resolution unmoored and both ships came to and moored within a mile of the town and within a cable's length of the ice which entirely shut up the head of the bayHere we found only one small sloop about fifty tons which as soon as the ice was clear was bound on a trading voyage to the NorthwardWe had no sooner dropt anchor than our boat was ordered out and our Captain with several other gentlemen went to visit Capt Clerke and to take his orders for our future proceedings We found him still growing weaker and weaker we therefore shortened our stay  On the d some of the principal officers and gentlemen went on shore and were received by a subaltern who now had the command of the fort situated close by a little miserable town called St Peter and St Paul which by its appearance could not be supposed to furnish provisions for the ships crew a single week We soon learnt that the Governor lived at a town called Bolcheritsk distant about miles and that an express had been sent to him on the th about noon in a sledge drawn by dogs to notify our arrival The subaltern in the mean time shewed us every civility We found on our landing a sledge drawn by dogs in readiness to receive our Commander and to conduct him to the residence of the officer already mentioned where he found some gentlemen belonging to the Resolution It was not however a little strange that though we were expected and that the Empress of Russia had given orders to her Governor to furnish us with every accommodation in his power that not a person was to be found that understood any other language than that of the natives of the place and of Russia neither of which languages was intelligible to  any of us so that having no interpreter every thing was to be conducted by signs  They were hospitably received and entertained with stewed fish venisonsoups and other dishes dressed after the manner of the country and the officer who now had the command behaved with an uncommon degree of civility or more properly servility by paying every attention that his circumstances would admit to make the Commodore's situation tolerable He had made him understand that at the distance of about sixteen wrests at a town called Paratounka there lived a priest who might possibly be able to converse with him and with that view he the very next day sent an express to invite him to the fort at the same time intimating that the Governor was a German who could talk all languages which accounts for the omission before complained of and indeed as it afterwards appeared we were expected here the preceding summer and that our arrival was now unlooked for On board the carpenters were busy in stripping the ships bows where they found the leak of the Resolution to have been chiefly seated The larboard bow had been stript of its sheathing and the oakum had been washed out The sailors were employed in getting the sick on shore with every part of the ships stores that stood in need of revisal and though the weather continued piercing cold no time was lost in forwarding the repairs  On the th one of our boats in putting the astronomer's assistant on shore at the influx of the tide was suddenly encircled by the floating ice in such a manner as not to be able to move one way or the other another boat sent to her relief was soon enclosed in the same manner and till  the return of the tide both were forced to remain in that deplorable situation not a person on board daring to trust himself among the floating ice to go to their assistance About twelve at night they were released and the icey prisoners returned on board almost perished with cold  A still worse accident happened to Lieut King the ingenious writer of the third volume of Cook's voyage on his first attempt to land for having no clue to direct him to the village before him in passing the trackless snow and ice the ice broke under him and for a moment he disappeared Providentially he rose again clear and the man who attended him having a boathook in his hand instantly threw it to him he catched it and laying it across two pieces of ice recovered his footing  On the th six gentlemen arrived from Bolcheritsk among whom was a merchant who came to trade for skins some of which he purchased from us as we thought at great prices but as we afterwards found for little more than half their value These are all monopolized by the Russian Company already mentioned in our account of the last summer's voyage and not a skin is to be had from the Kamshatskadales This gentleman was accompanied by the Governor's Secretary who could speak both German and Dutch and who brought a letter from the Governor written in German complimenting the Commodore on his arrival tendering his best services and excusing his absence adding at the same time that when he was made acquainted with the necessaries of which we stood in need he would give immediate orders for their supply as far as was in his power and that he would embrace the first opportunity of waiting upon the Commodore It  happened that Mr Webber our draughtsman was master of the German and on reading the letter it was judged more respectful as well as more suitable to the occasion for Capt Gore our Commander and Lieut King of the Resolution to be messengers as they could give a more particular account of our many wants than could possibly be transmitted in a letter  On the th the Ruffian gentlemen were entertained on board the ships Mr Webber acting as interpreter to the merchant and the governor's secretary understanding a little French was well enough understood to make the conversation and the bottle pass jovially round About ten at night the company parted and  In the morning of the th Capt Gore attended by Lieut King of the Resolution and Mr Webber and accompanied by the merchant and Ruffian secretary set out for Bolcheritsk Bolcheraika says our Journalist mistaking the name of the river for the name of the town where after a most fatiguing journey they arrived on the th and were received by Major Behm the Governor with a politeness that did honour to the post he filled  After the usual salutations they entered into general conversation when our gentlemen soon discovered that the Major was not only a man of breeding but of general knowledge that he had been made acquainted by his court with our intention of touching at Kamshatska that the character of our first Commander Capt Cook was known to him by the historical relations of his former expeditions and that the whole route that he was supposed to pursue in the present expedition he had deduced from his own observations aided by the charts and maps of which he  was himself in possession Capt Gore when he came to speak of our Northwest course put the letter into his hands which our Commodore received from the Ruffian Ismyloff at Samganuida of which notice has already been taken and which chiefly related to the business of the factory having only slightly touched upon the civilities he had received from us and had represented us as interlopers or merchantboats engaged in a new line of commerce which he apprehended might be injurious to that in which the factory was engaged The Governor however was of too liberal a turn of mind to be at all affected by such an illfounded opinion but had he been inclined to give ear to this uncandid insinuation or to the natural jealousy and distrust of the Kamtschatskadales for they had not yet got rid of the panic with which they were seized at our first approach an incident had just happened that would have infallibly established their credit The reader will recollect that in passing Beering's Straits the ships touched at a town on the Asiatic coast inhabited by the Tschutskoi nation a race of stout hardy men totally different from the Americans on the opposite side of the Straits This nation had hitherto maintained their independence and had resisted all the attempts of the Ruffians to reduce them The last expedition against them in terminated in the defeat of the Ruffians who from that time had removed their frontier fortress from the Anadyr to the Ingiga a river that empties itself into the sea of Okotsk From this fort the Governor received dispatches the day of the arrival of our officers at Bolcheritsk containing intelligence that a tribe of the Tschutskoi had arrived at that place with propositions of  friendship and voluntary offer of tribute that on enquiring into this unexpected alteration in their sentiments they had informed his people that towards the letter end of the last summer they had been visited by two very large Ruffian boats that they had been treated by the people who were in them with the greatest kindness and had entered into a league of friendship and amity with them and that relying on this friendly disposition they are now come to the Ruffian fort in order to settle a treaty on such terms as might be acceptable to both nations This extraordinary history had occasioned much speculation both at Ingeginsk and Bolcheritsk and had not our gentlemen furnished them with a key to it must have remained perfectly unintelligible they felt however no small satisfaction at being able to clear up the mystery with which too the Governor was no less pleased than instructed  By this time dinner was ready and the gentlemen were invited to partake of what had been provided they would have excused themselves on account of dress but the Governor would admit no apology  After dinner they took occasion to deliver to the Governor their instructions with a list of those articles of which the ships stood most in need representing at the same time the shattered condition of the ships and how much they were in want of sails and cordage as well as provisions having met with no supply of beef or bread from the time they left England in to the present day nor of tobacco a chief article with our sailors though for three months they had been under the necessity of subsisting without The Governor heard him with attention and being sensible that the gentlemen must be  fatigued and desirous of rest begged he might be permitted to conduct them to the house prepared for their residence during their stay where they found every thing provided for them in the nicest order and a housekeeper and cook a serjeant two sentinels and an interpreter allowed for their domestics These civilities were accompanied with the most lively expressions of esteem at parting and in the morning when the gentlemen rose they found their wishes anticipated by an order lying on their table ready to be forwarded to the subaltern at the fort to supply the ships with the articles they most wanted without regard to their being wanted by the garrison  The gentlemen were not more gratified than astonished at finding the spirit of a prince in a Governor sent to the remotest corner of the earth to preside over a semibarbarous people living in a district the most deplorable and uncultivated but they were still more surprised when upon enquiring as to the price of the several articles they stood in need of they were told that nothing more was required of them than an attestation of those things being received which should be in his power to furnish in justification of his own conduct in not having been wanting in duty to his Sovereign whose commands he had received to exert his utmost endeavours to contribute every assistance to promote a design so liberally set on foot by her favourite ally the King of GreatBritain  And recollecting that tobacco was an article highly prized by the mariners and not to be purchased at any price in his district our gentlemen before their departure from Bolcheritsk found a quantity not less than weight deposited in their house  "labelled as a present to the seamen  on board the ships"  and another bag containing pounds of tea and loaves of sugar as the present from the Governor's lady to the officers along with these she had likewise sent a present of fresh butter honey figs rice c for Capt Clerke with her good wishes for the recovery of his health  We should be wanting therefore in justice to this worthy Governor were we to pass over his behaviour to us unnoticed which was such as did honour to his feelings as a man and to her Imperial Majesty as an officer  Our gentlemen after being entertained in a most magnificent manner for several days was accompanied in their return by the Governor himself who after enforcing his orders for our immediate supply from the country came to see that his orders had been obeyed at the fort He had already ordered weight of meal to be collected from different districts at a great distance and conveyed to us at whatever expence accompanied with head of horned cattle These our sailors rejoiced to see and though skeletons compared with those of England were received by us with an eagerness not easily to be exceeded for not having had the relish of fresh beef for more than three years the very scrapings of the bones would have been to our sailors at this time a treat infinitely more grateful than at home they would have thought the most luxurious feast  On the th while the gentlemen were still at Bolcheritsk a small bullock procured by the serjeant of the fort was killed and divided between the crews of both ships The same evening John M'Intosh the carpenter mate of the Resolution died and was decently buried and the aged priest at Parantounka attending  It was the d before the Governor and officers arrived at Paratounka in the vicinage of which the priest resided of whom we have already spoken With him the Governor spent the afternoon but when night came he slept at the fort if fort a mere loghouse could be called without either gun or platform to place a gun  On the th the pinnace from the Resolution was manned and properly equipped to bring him on board He was saluted with guns from the Resolution and from the Discovery and when he entered the ship he was received with music and with all the honours that circumstances would admit and he was so well pleased with his reception that he staid two days and two nights on board during which time Capt Clerke being ill committed the care of entertaining him to the officers with whom he was acquainted who did not fail to make it agreeable Some very noble presents were made him at his departure consisting of curiosities collected from every part of the world with a gold watch two fowlingpieces a brace of silvermounted pistols and other valuable articles of English manufacture to all which were added near gallons of brandy from the ships stores as a present from the sailors out of their allowance they having at their own request desired that so much should be spared out of their allowance for grog in lieu of the tobacco that his Excellency had generously ordered to be divided amongst them gratis tobacco at that time had been in such estimation that he who had been provident enough to make a reserve sold it nearly at the price of silver  Orders were now given to get every thing on board and prepare for sailing as fast as possible both ships had been stripped of their sheathing  to the water's edge but the leak of the Discovery was found much lower being a hole worn in her bow which had not the hull been cleared could never have been come at  Having now got the meal on board the crews were served with an allowance of half rye and half flour which however not being accustomed to they did not very well relish though it was found to be very wholesome The Governor had made Capt Clerke a present of a cow for which it was necessary to provide provender and large quantities of ducks geese and poultry were taken on board to supply the want of other live stock for here they had no sheep nor any other domestic animal except dogs which serve the natives both for horses and hunting nor was there a cow in the country that we saw except what the Governor sent to Capt Clerke and one in possession of the priest What was remarkable though the sea seemed almost covered with wild ducks and seafowl of various sorts they were all so shy that very few were killed  We had now been here a month when  On the th of June being his Majesty's birthday the same was celebrated with great magnificence on board and on shore The ships were dressed with streamers and with the colours of all nations and a flag was displayed at the tents The Russian gentlemen were sumptuously entertained on board and the common men were served with double allowance of meat and liquor and being permitted to divert themselves on shore many of them made parties and traversed the woods in pursuit of game with which they were told the country abounded But as they were ignorant of their haunts they met with no success  Before our departure packets were entrusted to the care of the Governor to be forwarded to England by the way of Petersburgh both for government and to private friends these we have since been informed were carefully transmitted And now having all things in readiness our full complement of wood and water on board and of every necessary the country afforded and waiting only for a wind  Early on the th of June we weighed and sailed directing our course to the northward but were detained in the bay till  The th when we were alarmed with a noise louder than the loudest thunder and presently were almost blinded with the fall of ashes which in less than an hour covered the decks all over from stern to stern an inch thick among which were mixed pumicestones as large as walnuts and many smaller stones which seemed to have received no alteration by fire We were all driven down between decks but about ten in the morning were released by the shower ceasing On looking round we found they issued from a volcano at the distance as we supposed of about twenty miles then bearing from us W S W During this eruption we were not only obliged to retire ourselves but to fasten down the hatches fore and aft so that what with the closeness of our confinement and the sulphureous fumes from the ashes we were almost suffocated We were therefore no sooner released than we weighed anchor and steered to the eastward  On the th and th we continued our course E and E by N  On the th steered E by N Lat  On the th came in sight of land high and covered with snow called by Beering Kronotskoinoss  but found that Cape a degree more to the southward than he had laid it down Lat  On the st we continued to steer E N E came in sight of Kamtschatskanoss saw a dead whale two seals and a number of sealions  On the d we stood to the N E and seeing a change in the colour of the water we sounded but found no ground at fathom We continued the same course till the th when we were in lat and long E  On the th we changed our course E N E and finding the sea covered with gulls and shags we sounded but found no ground at fathom  On the th we stood E onehalf N and found ourselves by observation in lat long E We changed our course and stood N N W  On the th early in the morning we came in sight of land very high and covered with snow the extreme point of which bore N E distance about leagues We continued our course along shore with regular soundings at about fathom free from reefs and a very bold shore We steered this course till  The th at noon when we were in lat Thadeus's Noss came in sight beyond which the coast seemed to stretch directly North Here it is observable that on the Asiatic coast the sea near the shore is everywhere of a convenient depth for sailing while on the opposite shore it continues so shallow for several degrees together as not to be navigated but with the utmost caution  On the st of July the weather began to grow hazy with thick fogs We shaped our course for the point in our chart called TschutkoskiNoss which with that of Thadeus form the N E and S W points of the gulph of Anadyr  The d in the morning when the fogs left us and it began to rain At ten in the morning saw a very high point of land bearing from us N N E distance about leagues We hauled upon a wind and stood E N E till two in the afternoon when we passed a small island called by the Russians St Nicholas in some parts very high and covered with snow Lat long  On the th at one in the morning we bore away N ½ E and about noon the next day saw land from W to N E appearing like two islands These were the islands of St Diomede in the midway between the two Continents At four o'clock we hauled up to W N W being near the East Cape of the Asiatic Continent and sounding from to fathom At ten at night the weather being clear we had an opportunity of seeing the remarkable peeked hill near Cape Prince of Wales on the American side and the East Cape of Asia with the two connecting islands of St Diomede between them  On the th we continued coasting from N ½ W to N ½ E with the land to the westward high and snowy Lat long E  On the th saw ice in a large body to the eastward distance about or leagues and about noon passed several large masses of ice We tacked and stood N W by W with a stiff gale and heavy snow  On the th fell in with the ice again in a solid body at the same time bore away S S W  On the th at three in the morning we hauled up along side the solid ice freezing cold all day Lat  On the th continued our course all the morning and at nine passed a large field of loose ice  distance about three miles and at noon went through it  On the th we found ourselves surrounded with ice We kept working to the S E passing many large fields of ice covered with seacows We kept luffing up and bearing away till with some difficulty we got through Lat by observation long We continued working through the ice till  The th when by observation we were in lat We continued bearing away to the northward till  The th when by observation we were in lat long and being very near the ice a large white bear passed us in the water but made for the ice at a great rate In half an hour we saw multitudes of them upon the ice making to the eastward when we observed the seacows as the bears approached them flying like sheep pursued by dogs  On the th we came in sight of land at the distance of about or leagues bearing from S to S E sounded from to fathom Our course being W ½ S all the morning at P M we altered it and stood to the southward and westward This day the crew of the Resolution had the good fortune to fall in with two large white bears and to kill them both the two fore tusks of the largest weighed lb  On the st we stood from W ½ N to W N W and at six o'clock we passed a large island of ice on which were whole herds of seacows of an enormous size We fired several muskets among them which sent them to the water with dreadful yellings At nine in the evening we came in sight of the American shore distant about six leagues We steered all night W by N and next  morning found ourselves almost surrounded with fields of ice drifting to the southward At twelve o'clock we hauled our wind to the southward and by the alertness of our seamen we passed them with very little damage  On the d about two A M we again stood S S W but at six saw the ice all round us from S E to N W hauled our wind upon our larboard tack and stood S S E We were all this day luffing up and bearing away to avoid the ice which was on every side in sight in many frightful shapes  On the morning of the d it came on to blow very hard and before noon we found ourselves closely blocked up in the ice and could see it all round us in a solid body to a great distance At the same time we saw the Resolution bearing N E ½ E some miles off which was the last sight we had of her during the whole day In this horrid situation we handed all our sails unbent our foretopsail and moored ship with both our ice anchors one to each bow  We now began to reflect on our condition the winter drawing on apace our provisions short and what we had but very indifferent and no relief to be expected our people's spirits began to sink and it was with difficulty that they were persuaded to exert themselves for their own deliverance Fortunately for us we had in the evening a shift of wind from W N W with a steady breeze when our Captain looking over our starboard quarter discerned the ice to the southward seemingly to leave the ship and soon heard a crash as if a thousand rocks had been rent from their foundations which we afterwards perceived to be the parting of the ice in different directions and soon after found ourselves released We instantly  got up our iceanchors and shaped our course from S E to E S E but were frequently stopped by large pieces which carried away great part of our sheathing forward and damaged our stern so that the ship made water at the rate of three inches and a half an hour and at the same time had inches in her well  On the th we continued our course E S E and came in fight of the Resolution which had likewise received much damage about her bows We were now clear of the ice and till three in the afternoon sailed in company till we came up with a solid body of ice on which we saw a number of amphibious animals some of them very large We instantly got out and manned our boats and in three hours returned with eleven of the largest about which all hands were employed the next day in skinning and cutting them up for blubber  On the th we passed several fields of ice We steered N E onehalf E and at noon was at the extreme of the easternmost land in sight being then in lat and by lunar observation in long East of London It was now excessive cold the snow froze as it fell The blocks were choaked up and the ropes increased by the frost to double their real size In this condition it is easy to conceive the fatigues to which the poor sailors were exposed yet by a little encouragement increasing their allowance of grog and giving them plenty of provisions they continued their labour with cheerfulness and astonishing perseverance  On the th we found ourselves involved again among the loose ice some of which it was out of our power to escape and the leak still continuing rather to increase than abate our Captain with  Mr Bailey the astronomer and Mr Burney our first Lieutenant went on board the Resolution to report our situation to the Commodore whom they found so ill as to be past all hopes of recovery Upon calling a council of officers it was unanimously agreed that we should proceed as fast as possible to some port where we might repair our damages and Kamshatska was appointed our place of rendezvous We were now in lat and in long shaping our course S E with a light breeze from W S W  On the th at two in the morning we came in sight of the Asiatic shore very high and covered with snow distance about or leagues we made sail and stood to the southward About noon we found ourselves in lat by double altitudes and in long E the extreme of the easternmost end of the ice distant about leagues At ten at night we saw a great number of ducks geese and seaparrots very near us by which we judged land could not be far off  On the th at noon we were in lat and long but no land in sight  On the th we steered till noon to the S E with a steady breeze and came in sight of two islands right ahead distant about five or six leagues The weather then became thick and hazy and though we were certain that the main land of Asia and America were at no great distance we could see neither till about four o'clock in the afternoon when the weather clearing up we saw a passage or streight to which we bore away and found the two continents at seven o'clock on each side of us Lat thirteen leagues asunder beyond which they diverge to N E by E and W N W so as in lat to be miles asunder This streight we called  North streight the entrance of which we found the same as has been already described and the current at this time setting to the N W very strong made our passage not only difficult but dangerous We shaped our course S S W and continued the same the whole night sounding from to fathom grey sand and small shells  On the st we passed Tschutuskoinoss called by the sailors Tuskannoss and soon came in sight of Cook's town which we visited the last season as has already been mentioned and which we now passed with regret  On the st of August we were in lat long the coast of Asia extending from N W by W distant about leagues  Nothing remarkable till August the th when we had an observation and found ourselves in lat  On the th at noon we were by observation in lat and in long and at no great distance from the land At four o'clock having a dead calm the companies of both ships employed themselves in fishing and very fortunately caught a great number of large cod which were equally distributed among the crews To this place we gave the name of the bank of Good Providence and as soon as the breeze sprung up we made sail and stood to S W  On the th at noon we were by observation in lat and long The weather being more moderate than it had been for several days the signal was made to speak with the Resolution when on enquiry we were informed that the Captain was past recovery and that the crew began to grow sickly At this time we had not one man on the sick list on board the Discovery  On the th we continued our course S W by W and on the th at noon having had contrary winds we were in lat with the ship's head to the S W  In the evening of the th we had the Resolution's boat on board to compare time who brought the disagreeable news of the Captain's being given over by the surgeon  On the th being in soundings and the weather calm we hove to in order to get some fish for the sick and a few cod were caught and sent on board the Resolution to be distributed accordingly  On the th the wind that had been against us for some days past shifted in our favour and at nine in the morning the man at the masthead called out land to the N W which was found to be the island of Mednor laid down to the S E of Beering Island lat at noon  Nothing remarkable till the st when early in the morning the man at the masthead again came in sight of land It was then at a very great distance and upon our starboard bow but before night we were only distant from the mouth of Kamshatska bay or leagues  On the d at nine in the morning we had the Resolution's boat on board to acquaint our Captain with the death of our Commodore We were then within sight of the flag at the mouth of Kamshatskabay of which mention has already been made and the wind being favourable we continued our course for the entrance of the harbour which then bore from us W S W lat at noon  On the d a little before midnight we came to anchor within the lighthouse  On the th our Captain being now Commodore made the signal to get under way by towing all the boats were accordingly got out and the Commodore went on board the Resolution where it was resolved for the greater convenience of repairing the ships and for erecting the tents and forge to go within the upper harbour And about four in the afternoon both ships came to and were moored in three fathom and a half water muddy bottom  The old serjeant who still commanded at the fort came with a present of berries for Capt Clerke He seemed much affected when he was shewn his coffin and was told it was his particular desire to be buried on shore  Early next morning the tents were erected and the sick were put on shore  From the time we set sail out of this bay in June till the present day we had been in no harbour to refit and had been driven from island to island among the ice till our ships had in a manner lost their sheathing and were otherwise in a shattered condition we were therefore happy in arriving safe  August th an express was sent to Bolcheritsk to acquaint the new governor Capt Shmaleff with our arrival and with the death of our late Commander at the same time requesting a fresh supply of cattle Another express was sent to Paratounka to desire the attendance of the priest in order to consult with him concerning the interment of Capt Clerke whose desire was to be buried in his church While we were waiting the issue of these messages the several promotions took place that followed in consequence of the Commander's death Mr Gore went on board the Resolution and Mr King first Lieut  of the Resolution took the command of the Discovery Other promotions took place which the reader will remark by the sequel The first care of the commanders of both ships was to provide for the recovery of the sick and the repairs of the ships and for that purpose a house was procured for the reception of the former and a contrivance made for having the latter dry  The weather being now temperate and the country delightful the officers and gentlemen chose to sleep in their marquees on shore It was however thought expedient to shew every mark of respect to the Russian officers who though not of the first rank were notwithstanding the only people with whom we had any concern or with whom we could have any communication they were therefore frequently invited to dinner and they often attended  On the th the priest arrived when Capt Gore acquainted him with the death of our commander and of his desire to be buried in his church The good old gentleman seemed much concerned but started several difficulties and appeared very unwilling to comply with the dying request of the deceased He urged several reasons to shew the impropriety of it those of most weight were that the church was soon to be pulled down that it was every winter three feet deep in water and that in a few years no vestige of it would remain as the new church was to be erected near the town of Awatska upon a drier and more convenient spot He therefore advised the remains of the Commander to be deposited at the foot of a tree the scite of which was to be included in the body of the new church where the Captain's bones might  probably rest for ages undisturbed These reasons whether real or fictitious the officers who had charge of the funeral could not disprove and therefore people were sent to dig the grave where the priest should direct  All hands were now busy at work on their different employments The Discovery on being examined was found to be in a most wretched condition many of her timbers beneath the wale shaken and some of her planks rotten and for want of others to supply their places were forced to be shifted  The th was appointed for the interment and to make the funeral the more solemn every officer was desired to appear in his uniform the marines to be drawn up under arms and the common men to be dressed as nearly alike as possible in order to attend the corpse from the waterside to the grave All this was readily complied with and the procession began about ten in the morning when minute guns from the ships were fired and the drums muffled as usual beat the dead march When the corpse arrived at the grave it was deposited under the triple discharge of the marines and the grave being covered it was fenced in by piles driven deep in the ground and the inside afterwards filled up with stones and earth to preserve the body from being devoured in the winter by bears or other wild beasts who are remarkable for their sagacity in scenting out the bodies of dead passengers when they happen to perish and are buried near the roads  This ceremony over an escutcheon was prepared and neatly painted by Mr Webber with the Captain's coat of arms properly emblazon'd and placed in the church of Paratounka and underneath the following inscription  There lies interred at the Foot of a Tree  near the Ostrog of St PETER and PAUL  The BODY of  CHARLES CLERKE ESQUIRE  COMMANDER of his Britannic Majesty's  Ships the Resolution and Discovery  To which he succeeded on the Death of  JAMES COOK Esquire  Who was killed by the Natives of an Island he  discovered in the South Sea after having ex  plored the Coast of America from deg  min to deg min sec N  in search of a Northwest Passage  from EUROPE to the  EASTINDIES  The Second Attempt being made by  CAPTAIN CLERKE who sailed within some few  Leagues of Captain Cook but was brought  up by a solid Body of Ice which he found  from the American to the Asia shore  and almost trended due East and  WestHe died at Sea  on his Return to the  Southward on the  d Day of  AUGUST  AGED Years  Another inscription was fixed upon the tree under which he was interred This tree was at some distance from the town and near the hospital round which several people had already been buried but none so high upon the hill as the spot pointed out for the grave of Capt Clerke The inscription placed on this tree was nearly the same as that in the church of Paratounka and was as follows  Beneath this Tree lies the BODY of  CAPTAIN CHARLES CLERKE  COMMANDER of his Britannic Majesty's  Ships the Resolution and Discovery  Which Command he succeeded to on the th  of February on the Death of  Captain JAMES COOK  Who was killed by the Natives of some  Islands he discovered in the SOUTH  SEA on the Date above  CAPTAIN CLERKE died at Sea  of a lingering Illness on the d Day of  AUGUST  In the th year of his AGE  And was INFERRED on the th following  On this occasion the inhabitants of both towns and those of the whole country for many miles round attended and the crews of both ships were suffered to continue ashore and to divert themselves each as he liked best It was the Captain's desire that they should have double allowance for three days successively and all that while to be excused from other duty than what the ordinary attendance in the ships required but the season being far advanced and a long track of unknown sea to pass before we could reach China the officers representing the hardships and inconveniencies that so much lost time might bring upon themselves they very readily gave up that part of the Captain's bequest and returned to their respective employments early the next day  On the th of September an Ensign arrived with a letter from the Governor to Capt Gore acquainting him that orders had been given about the cattle that the bearer was to remain to take care that nothing should be wanted that the garrison could supply and that on the arrival of a sloop from Okotzk which was daily expected he would himself supply his place  The Ensign farther informed Capt Gore that the sloop was laden with provisions and stores of all sorts for the use of the ships but expressed some apprehensions for her safety as the boats had been looking out for her several days This news was of too much importance to be slighted Accordingly  On the d the pinnaces and beats from both ships were sent to the entrance of the bay to assist in case she should be in sight in towing her  but it was  The th before she arrived She was a bark of about tons and had two guns mounted which she fired as a salute when she dropt anchor and was answered by a volley from the garrison which consisted of a subaltern and twentyfive soldiers She was no sooner moored than we received a visit from a Putparochich or SubLieutenant who was to take the command of the fort He was introduced to the Commodore to whom he delivered the invoice of his lading among which were wearing apparel and tobacco two articles that were above all others acceptable to the ships companies  As soon as the Lieutenant had executed his commission and delivered up the stores to the Commodore he took his leave and returned to Bolcheritsk and the ships being lightened afore and their bows heaved up dry so that the carpenters could get at the leaks the Captains and principal officers finding little else to amuse them made a party to scour the woods for game but this proved the worst season in the year for hunting They had been told that reindeer wolves foxes beavers and stonerams every where abounded in the forests of this country and they had promised themselves great sport in pursuing them but after staying out full two days and nights during which time they had been exposed to several severe storms they returned much fatigued without having been able to kill a single creature The parties who had been sent out to wood and water had succeeded much better As soon as the ships were ready to launch they were ready to compleat the hold In short the utmost dispatch was made to hasten our departure so that by the latter end of September  we were in readiness to put to sea The cattle with which we were now supplied one would have thought had dropt from another region It is among the wonders of nature with what celerity every vegetable and every animal changes its appearance in this climate  On the th of June when we left the harbour of Kamshatska the spring had but just begun to announce the approach of summer by the budding of the trees and the springing of the grass but now on our return it was matter of surprize to find the fruits ripe and the harvest in full perfection The cattle were mere skin and bone which we were glad to accept at first coming but those that were now sent us were fine and fat and would have made no bad figure in Smithfieldmarket The grass was in many places as high as our knees and the corn where any grew bore the promising appearance of a fine crop In short from the most dreary barren and desolate aspect that any habitable country could present this was become one of the most delightful Mr Nelson reaped a rich harvest of rare plants and had the additional pleasure of gathering them in their most exalted state  In this interval of idle time between compleating our repairs and clearing the harbour we had leisure to take a view of the town near the shore where we first moored and that of Paratounka where the priest lived and where the church was situated These towns have received some improvement since they became subject to the Rus+sians but are still most wretched dwellings The houses are built if we may call that building which is half dug out of the earth and half  upon poles in two different forms one for their  summer and the other for their winter residence  Their winter habitation is made by digging a square hole in the earth about five or six feet deep the length and breadth being proportioned to the number of people that are to live in it At each corner of this square hole they set up a thick post and in the intermediate space between these corner posts they place other posts at certain distances and over these they lay balks fastening them together with strong cords which they make of nettles prepared in the manner of hemp Across these they place other balks in the manner of a bridge then cover the whole with thatch leaving a square opening in the middle which serves at once for door window and chimney On one side of this square is their fireplace and on the opposite side is ranged their kitchenfurniture On the two other sides are a kind of broad benches made with earth on which each family lie and in one of these huts or houses there live several families To enter these huts by the only opening at top they use a ladder not made with rounds between two sides like ours but consisting only of narrow slips of wood fastened to a plank This ladder the women mount with great agility with children at their backs and though the smoke would blind and suffocate those who are not used to it yet the Kamshatskadales find no inconvenience from it  Their summer huts called balagans are made by fixing up posts about fourteen feet above ground and laying balks over them as before On these they make a floor and then raise a roof which they thatch with grass To these balagans they have two doors which they ascend by the same kind of ladder  In the winter they use the balagans for magazines the thatch secures what they lay up in them from rain and by taking away the ladder it becomes inaccessible to wild beasts and vermin  It being summer we had no access to their winter dwellings which were all shut up and they were not over fond of exposing their poverty for though they have little to boast of they are not without pride The whole furniture of the commonality consists of dishes bowls troughs and cans their cans are made of birch bark their other utensils of wood which till the Russians introduced iron among them they hollowed with instruments made of stone or bone but with these tools their work was tedious and difficult In these bowls they dress their food though being wood they will not bear the fire  In the winter the men are employed in hunting making sledges and fetching wood and the women in weaving nets and spinning thread  In the spring the rivers begin to thaw and the fish that wintered in them to go towards the sea the men therefore in this season are busied in fishing and the women in curing what they catch  They chiefly catch the salmon which are very plenty and very delicious by spearing at which they are as aukward as at shooting  In the summer the men build both their winter and summer huts train their dogs and make their houshold utensils and warlike instruments but the women make all the clothing even to the shoes Their clothes for the most part are made of the skins of land and seaanimals particularly deer dogs and seals but sometimes they use the skins of birds and frequently those of different animals in the same garments They commonly  wear two coats the under one with the hair inwards and the upper one with the hair outwards The women have besides an under garment not unlike Dutch trowsers divided and drawn round the knees with strings  They are filthy beyond imagination They never wash their hands or faces nor pare their nails They eat out of the same dish with the dogs which they never wash Both men and women plait their hair in two locks which they never comb and those who have short hair supply the locks with false This is said of the Kamshatskadales who live more to the North those in the towns which we saw had learnt of the Russians to be more cleanly  They are very superstitious and the women in particular pretend to avert misfortunes cure diseases and foretel future events by muttering incantations over the fins of fishes mingled with a certain herb which they gather from the woods with much labour They pretend also to judge of good and bad fortune by the lines of the hands and by their dreams which they relate to each other as soon as they awake They dread going near the burning mountains lest the invisible beings that inhabit them should hurt them and think it a sin to drink or to bathe in the hot springs with which their country abounds because they suppose those springs to be heated by the evil spirits that produce them They are said never to bury their dead but binding a strap round the neck of the corpse drag it to the next forest where they leave it to be eaten by the bears wolves or other wild inhabitants They have a notion that they who are eaten with dogs will drive with fine dogs in another world They throw away all the  clothes of the deceased because they believe that they who wear them will die before their time  The country is said to abound with wild beasts which constitute the principal riches of the inhabitants particularly foxes sables stonefoxes and hares marmots ermins weasles bears wolves reindeer and stonerams but our gentlemen were much disappointed who went in pursuit of them The only game they killed was a shebear though they diverted themselves in hunting with the natives for several days nor were they much more successful in shooting even the seafowl were hardly to be come at they were so watchful They have a species of weasle called the glutton whose fur is so much more esteemed than all others that they say the good spirits are clothed with it The paws of this animal are white as snow but the hair of the body is yellow Sixty rubles about guineas nearly have been given for a skin and a seabeaver for a single paw  Of the bears the inhabitants make good use of their skins they make their beds coverings caps collars and gloves and of their flesh and fat their most delicious food but their manner of hunting them is attended with much danger and little profit They watch their haunts and follow their tracks to the lakes where they resort They then choose some convenient place to conceal themselves to be in readiness to watch their prey They then plant their rests for no Kamtshatskadale ever shoots without a rest and when the bear comes within distance they point their guns and let fly If they kill or maim so that the bear cannot pursue 'tis well but if they miss as they frequently do 'tis happy for the hunter if he escapes The enraged beast makes at the place whence the report is heard and if  not received on the hunter's spear which he always has in reserve the combat becomes so unequal that the bear is generally the conqueror  The Kamshatskadales all along the Northern coasts have a particular manner of dressing their food which is the very reverse of that of the Indians in the South There they roast or stew with stones made hot and buried as it were in the earth with their meat by which its relish is said to be much improved But here they boil it with hot stones immersed in water by which its flavour is rendered more insipid The same necessity however seems to have pointed out the same means to the people of the torrid and the frigid zones for both being equally unacquainted with iron and wood being incapable of resisting fire when brought in contact with it though the principle was obvious the application was difficult those therefore of the torrid zone would naturally be led to call the warmth of the earth to their aid whilst those in the frozen climates would think water a more ready assistant add to this that the colder regions abound with hot springs some in Kamshatska in particular are so hot as to approach nearly to the degree of boiling water but these they think it sinful to use as we have already observed  The dogs of this country are like our village curs and are of different colours They feed chiefly on fish and their masters use them instead of horses or reindeer to draw sledges  The seas and lakes abound with a variety of amphibious animals of which seals and seahorses and seacows are the most numerous and the most profitable Of the skins of the seal they make their canoes and on their flesh and fat they feed  deliciously Whales are sometimes cast upon the shores but very seldom unless wounded  With the teeth and bones of the seahorse and seacow they point their arrows and weapons of war and of their fat and blubber they make their oil They have otters in their lakes but their skins bear a great price  They have birds of various kinds in great abundance Among the seafowl they have the puffin the seacrow the Greenland pigeon and the cormorant They have swans geese and eleven species of ducks and they have plovers snipes and small birds without number They have likewise four kinds of eagles the black eagle with a white head the white eagle the spotted eagle and the brown eagle They have vultures also and hawks innumerable  This country swarms with insects in the summer which are very troublesome but they have neither frog toad nor serpent Lizards are not rare but they believe these creatures to be spies sent from the infernal powers to inspect their lives and foretel their deaths and therefore whenever they see one they kill it and cut it into small pieces that it may not carry back any intelligence to their hurt  But what is most remarkable and deserves the attention of the curious is the general conformity between the Kamshatskadales towards the East and of the Americans that live on the opposite coast just over against them in their persons habits customs and food both dress exactly in the same manner both cut holes in their faces in the manner already described in which they put bones like false teeth by way of ornament and both make their canoes exactly on the same construction These are about twelve feet long and two  broad sharp at the head and stern and flat at the bottom they consist of flat pieces of wood joined at both ends and kept apart in the middle by a transverse piece through which there is a round hole just large enough for the man to insert his legs and to seat himself on a bench made on purpose this skeleton is covered with sealskin dyed of a kind of purple colour and the whole is skirted with loose skin which when the man is seated he draws close round him like the mouth of a purse and with a coat and a cap of the same skin which covers his whole body makes the man and his boat appear like one piece and thus clad and thus seated and surrounded he fears neither the roughest sea nor the severest weather But here it is necessary to distinguish between the native Kamshatskadales and the Russians who live at Kamtshatska who preserve the Russian language and the Russian manners  And now we have had occasion to mention this similiarity between the inhabitants on the opposite shores of Asia and America we shall embrace this opportunity to correct a very material error in our account of our last year's voyage where speaking of the Russian Discoveries we took notice after examining Beering's Straits though the Russians supposed that the lands were parted here we found the continent to join by which the Reader will no doubt imagine that we have asserted that the two continents of Asia and America join which they do not but are separated by a strait between two promontories which in clear weather are so near as to be seen in sailing through with the naked eye But what is meant is this When Beering made his discovery in coasting along the American shore he discovered a sound or strait which having surmounted  he found himself in a great bay which he imagined was another sea and that the land which he had passed was not the American continent but a great island separated from the continent by the sound or strait just mentioned This sound therefore and this bay we examined and sound that what the Russians had mistaken for an island is actually a part of the American continent Hence it appears that notwithstanding all that was written against it Beering is justly entitled to the honour of having discovered all that part of the N W continent of America that has been hitherto marked in our maps as parts unknown  It remains now only to give a short description of the bay and harbour where we repaired which at the entrance is between two very high bluff rocks On the starboard as we enter is the lighthouse of which mention has already been made and at the distance of about twenty miles the volcano from whence flames and ashes are sometimes emitted and these eruptions are carried by the wind to a great distance and to the great terror of the inhabitants The bay is about eight leagues deep and lies from S E to N W and from N E to S W it is about four leagues It is inaccessible during the winter by reason of the ice but very safe and convenient during the summer There are in it three excellent harbours  The harbour where we lay to careen and repair would contain about twenty ships of the line in perfect safety being closely surrounded with high hills except at the entrance The people are civil and in their way very obliging but their manner of living affords nothing very enchanting for sailors  Our ships being now in as good repair as we had reason to expect from the length of the voyage they had passed the rigorous weather to which they had been exposed the boisterous seas they had shipped and above all from the violent concussions of the ice that had shaken their very frames and had stript them of their sheathing and being likewise plentifully provided with provisions and stores by the generosity of her Imperial Majesty of Russia and by the care and benevolence of her Governors and officers  On the th of October we weighed and soon were without the lighthouse shaping our course to the southward and  On the th were in lat when we had a dead calm and went to fishing for cod with good success Thermometer  On the th we pursued our course and by noon were in lat  On the th we stood S W and at night sounded at sixtytwo fathom having in the afternoon passed three small islands to the westward of us and Cape Lopatka the southernmost extremity of Kamtshatska Lat Thermometer ½  On the th we were in lat long Course as before  On the th we still continued the same course full in view and passed Paramousin the largest of the Kurile Islands Lat  The th we altered our course in search of some islands which the Russians said were inhabited by people of a gigantic size who were covered with hair but who notwithstanding were very civil and would supply us with cattle and hogs with which their islands abounded These islands however we never found nor the land of  De Gama though we continued searching for them till  The th when a storm came on and we lost sight of the Discovery but next day were in company and resumed our course the gale continuing till  The d when we found ourselves in lat and long E from London The wind which had abated in the day freshened again about nine at night and soon increased to a gale when we were obliged to lieto as we imagined from the usual signs and soundings at eighty fathoms that we must be near land  In the morning of the d we stood N N W in search of land but found none At noon by double al  lat  long E About ten at night we altered our course W N W and so continued till  The th when we were in lat long E and continued our course with an easy sail At three in the afternoon a large piece of timber passed us to the northward And  On the th early in the morning the man at the masthead called out land distant about seven or eight leagues bearing E by N to N W We then found ourselves within sight of Japan The country is of a moderate heigth consists of a double chain of mountains abounds with wood and has a pleasing appearance being chequered with hills and vallies and well stored with houses villages and cites Here being only in ten fathom off the shore we cast our fishinglines overboard but without success Lat long E Thermometer  Early in the morning of the th we saw sail seemingly very large making towards us from the shore We cleared ship and made the signal to  the Discovery to do the same One was a squarerigged vessel though she had but one mast appeared to be higher at each end than in the midship very shor  and built much in the manner of the Chinese junks We hoisted English colours She looked at us but made sail to the westward and we continued our course  On the th we saw land bearing W N W to S half W distant about six leagues We then sounded sixtyfour fathom and stood from S to S E by E Lat long Thermometer fifty nine and a half  On the th we again stood S half W and in the morning observed another vessel making  the eastward at a great distance We again hoisted English colours but she paid no attention to them and we pursued our course  On the th we were in lat steering S W Thermometer sixtyfour and a

blew in heavy squalls  November  steered all day from S to S W saw a high mountain which seemed to be a vol+cano but at a great distance Lat at noon  Tacked and stood to the northward  On the d we again tacked and stood E half S and finding the water of a milky colour sounded but had no ground at fathoms Lat long Thermometer  and a half  The d the wind  om the S S E we now continued working to

pumice stones floating to the Northward several pieces of which being taken up weighed from one ounce to three pounds We now approached the climate where bonettoes albatrosses sharks dolphins porpusses and flyingfish are seen to play their frolics  On the th we saw seaweed pieces of timber great quantities of pumice and other signs of land but no land came in fight At night we shortened

all day we still continued to pass prodigious quantities of pumicestones which almost cover the sea between Japan and the Basha Islands which indicate some great convulsion in nature Our officers were of opinion that the Company's land and Staten Island had disappeared in this convulsion but our philosophers were of another mind Lat at noon long E  On the th made sail W S W At A M the Discovery made the signal for land which we answered It then bore S W distant seven or eight leagues and appeared like a burning mountain from whence proceeded as was supposed on better grounds all the pumice we had seen In the night saw volumes of flame proceeding from it very awful  On the th lost sight of the volcano but in the evening another made a still more awful appearance and the volcanic crater was clearly descernible by our glasses on board the ship This was confirmed by the strong sulphureous smell which they omitted as we approached them To the southernmost our Captain gave the name of Sulphur Island Lat long We were now in lat long E Thermometer ½  On the th we bore away W half S Wind fresh from E N E At noon found ourselves in lat having by the variation and setting of the current

stowing the main topmaststaysail of the Discovery fell over board but fortunately laying hold of a rope hanging from the forechains into the water he was got on board without any other hurt than a slight bruise on one shoulder Lat at noon  The th we again bore away W S W and so continued all day  The th continued the same course all day At night shortened sail and hauled up to N N W  Early on the th we were surprised by breakers close under our bows Made the signal to the Discovery and immediately tacked to the Southward At seven we wore ship and again stood to the N W At ten saw breakers from N E by E to W by S the nearest distant about a mile We sounded at fiftyfour fathom and bore away W S W keeping a proper distance from the reefs and coasting along till we passed them About noon the S W end bore from us N N W distant about two miles lat long the island of Prata distant or  leagues We then made sail N N W which course we continued all night  On the th about eight A M we came in sight of a whole fleet of small craft which we took to be fshingvessels They were at a great distance and not one of them left their employment to come near us Lat We were now only distant from Macao the port to which we were bound about twentysix leagues  On the th we wore ship and stood to the Southward and about eleven in the morning the man at the masthead called out Land bearing W ½ S distant about three leagues This proved one of the northernmost of the Ladrone Islands As soon as we came within distance we fired two guns for a pilot and one came presently alongside and our Captain agreed for thirtyfive dollars to carry us into Macao  December st about two in the afternoon after a passage of oneandtwenty days we cast anchor within four miles of the harbour where we were met by two Chinese gentlemen who told us of the French war and of his Majesty's ship the Seahorse having left that place about the time we left Kamshatska About eight in the evening our boats were manned and our third Lieutenant went to the English factory there for news and about ten returned with the magazines and newspapers for being the latest they had received He likewise brought a confirmation of the French war and of the continuance of the American war and that five sail of English ships were now at Vampo near Canton in China  On the d early in the morning we made sail and anchored abreast of the island and saluted the Governor with thirteen guns which were answered  with an equal number from the fort We had scarce dropt anchor when we were visited by two English gentlemen who after learning who we were and what we had been upon persuaded the Commodore to leave our then situation and to moor the ships in a safer birth to the leeward of a small island about two miles distant where they might remain without danger  It was now three years since we had been in any port where we could converse any otherwise than by signs and before any one was suffered to go ashore the Commodore called all hands aft and ordered them to deliver up their journals and every writing remark or memorandum that any of them had made of any particular respecting the voyage on pain of the severest punishment in case of concealment in order that all those journals writings remarks or memorandums respecting the voyage might be sealed up and directed to the Lords of the Admiralty At the same time requiring that every chart of the coasts or of any part of any of the coasts where we had been or draught of any thing curious might be delivered up in like manner in order to accompany the journals c all which was complied with and the papers were made up and sealed accordingly in sight of the whole crew the papers of the commissioned officers by themselves the papers of the noncommissioned officers by themselves and the papers of the marines and common men by themselves The boats were then ordered out and sent to Macao for fresh provisions which next day were dealt out to the ships companies at full allowance But before these could return there came from the town boats with beef veal pork ducks geese turnips carrots lemons oranges and every other  article of provisions which the island produced some as presents to the Captains and officers but by far the greatest part to make their market  Being now safely moored the first thing that claimed the attention of the Commodore was to provide as well as he could for the safety of the crews in their return home The news of a French war without letting us know at the same time the order issued by the French king in our favour gave us much concern Our ships were ill fitted for war the decks fore and aft being finished flush had no covering for men or officers it was therefore thought necessary to strengthen the stanchions and rails and to raise a kind of parapet musketproof on both decks and likewise to strengthen the cabins as much as possible in case of action And as it was agreed that both ships could carry more guns if any were to be purchased the Commodore was for taking the ships to Canton till persuaded from it by some gentlemen belonging to the English factory who undertook to negociate the business without giving umbrage to the Chinese who certainly would they said be offended at the appearance of ships of war in their river and would oppose their progress reminding him at the same time of the disagreeable dispute in which Commodore Anson was formerly involved on a similar occasion and how hurtful it was to the Company's commerce for several years after Upon these representations the Commodore relinquished his design and Capt King with other officers were sent in a Company's ship assisted by one or two gentlemen belonging to the factory to Canton to purchase cannon and such other stores as were not to be had at Macao  On the th they set sail and at the same time two Portuguese vessels from the harbour of Macao came and anchored close by us They were bound to Bengal and Madras and very readily assisted us with ropes for running rigging some canvas and with fathom of cable They likewise exchanged four small cannon and some shot with the Discovery for a spare anchor  The th being Christmasday was kept as is usual with English sailors in jollity and mirth and what added to the pleasure of the day there was not a man ill in either ship  On the th the Commodore received a letter from Capt King with an account of the disasters that had happened in the passage having lost two anchors and their boat and were several times in danger of running ashore that they did not arrive at Canton till the th but that he hoped soon to return with the cannon and stores for which he had bargained though at a great price  Here they learnt that the skins we had brought with us from the N W Continent of America were of nearly double the value at Canton as at Kamshatska  Early on the th there came into the harbour of Macao a Spanish galleon from Manilla said to have more than two millions of treasure on board and before we left our station there came in another worth double that sum We were unacquainted with the Spanish war or these ships had we been properly commissioned might easily have been captured It is astonishing that none of our cruisers have ever lain in wait for these ships as their voyage is annual and their course known  The same evening a quarrel happened between a party of our sailors on shore with leave and some of the town's people in which several were dangerously wounded on both sides and Mr Burney first Lieutenant of the Resolution had a dagger run through his left arm in endeavouring to put an end to the fray For this insult the Governor sent to demand satisfaction but upon examination the town's people were found to be the aggressors The Governor made a very handsome apology for his mistake and the affair ended without any serious consequences  We were now visited daily by strangers who came out of curiosity to see ships that had been so many years upon discovery and every one was anxious to learn what he could concerning our course but that we were not at liberty to tell them Among the rest came two French spies as we imagined but not being able to make out any thing criminal against them they were suffered to depart The suspicion arose from some of our men who having particularly marked them insisted that they had formerly sailed with them in the French service Nothing remarkable till  Jan the th when Capt King with the officers that accompanied him arrived in the Company's vessel with the cannon ammunition and stores from Canton These being shipped nothing remained to be done but to take on board the live stock which the Commodore and officers had purchased for their own use and nine head of cattle to be killed at sea for the use of the ship's company the beef and pork which we brought from England being now scarce eatable Provisions of all kinds were here very dear and very indifferent but what made us amends was the  price they gave for our furs on which they set a great value  On the th of January we unmoored and the wind being fair came to sail with a pleasant breeze but the wind dying away in the evening we cast anchor and in the night John Cave Quartermaster and Robert Spencer ran away with the great cutter And  On the th we were the whole day detained in endeavouring to recover them but to no purpose  On the th we passed the fort and saluted the garrison with four pounders which they answered with an equal number  We had now nothing but a beaten track to pass in our way to our long wishedfor native country  On the th we made the little group of islands known by the name of Pulo Condore in lat N at one of which we anchored and found it inhabited Here we both wooded and watered and the carpenters felled some large trees which were afterwards sawed on board The trees on these islands are chiefly cedar ironwood mangrove manchinael and box Some nutmegtrees there were but of a wild kind that bear a fruit without taste or smell In pursuit of game of which there was plenty our gentlemen fell in with a party of natives one of whom accompanied them to the ships We made him understand that we wanted provisions and he had not left us long before a number of boats came round the island laden with fruits fowls ducks and other provisions which they readily exchanged for any thing we offered them though they were not wholly unacquainted with the use of money for being informed that herds of buffaloes were on the island we purchased seven three of them of a large size  from four to seven dollars each These were fierce animals and were not easily brought on board but after being subdued were as gentle and tractable as the gentlest of our other cattle What seems surprising is that the men on the island dare hardly go near them when loose in the woods but they will suffer little boys to handle and halter them which is done by passing a rope through a hole made in their nostrils and round their horns notwithstanding which some of them broke the trees down to which they were fastened Here we found the cabbagetree and other succulent greens with which our people made very free without asking questions  On the th we unmoored and on  The st made the island of Banka and having passed the Straits  On the th of February we made the island of Sumatra where we saw a large ship lying at anchor and  On the th passed the island of Java where we saw two more We made the signal to the Discovery to prepare for action and we did the same hoisting English colours It was some time before they shewed any but at length they hoisted Dutch colours We sent our boat on board and received the first news of a Spanish war We pursued our course and  On the th we made the island of Cocoterra Here from a healthy ship's company several of our people fell ill of the flux and so continued for some time however having got plenty of good water on board we sailed  On the th directing our course to Prince's island  On the th we entered the bay of Prince's island where Capt Cook when he commanded  the Endeavour anchored in his return to Europe Here we purchased turtles fowls and some deer and here we laid in store of cocoanuts plantains and other vegetables and having compleated our stock of water set sail  On the th directing our course for the Cape of Good Hope Nothing remarkable till  The th of March when we were attacked by a severe storm attended with thunder lightning and rain which lasted five days without intermission  On the th of April we were alarmed by finding our rudderhead almost twisted off We got the pendants fixed to steer with tackles it being the carpenter's opinion it could not last till our arrival at the next port However by proper application it lasted till we arrived at the Cape  On the th we fell in with Cape Lagullas where about nine in the morning we saw a small vessel cruising which proved to be the East India Company's snow Betsey looking out for the East India fleet She left England the th of November and False Bay on the th instant She confirmed the account we had received of the Spanish war We exchanged some trifles and soon parted And  On the th we entered Bay False came to and moored the same day after having saluted the fort with guns which was answered by the same number We had scarce dropt anchor when the Governor came on board bringing with him a packet of letters for Capt Cook which had lain there ever since the beginning of he had heard of the death of Capt Cook by a Dutch vessel and expressed great concern for that unhappy event asking a thousand questions concerning the particulars  The first care of our Commodore was to provide for the sick and by three in the afternoon they were all landed and sent to the hospital under the care of the Surgeon's mate All hands were next set to their different employments some to wood and water and some to compleat the repairs These they forwarded with the utmost expedition every one being eager to get to his native country Of the repairs the Resolution's rudder was the most material The first thing therefore to be done was to unhinge it and get it on shore and though this was immediately put in hand it was  The th before it was restored to its place  By the th the fick who were numerous when we arrived at the Cape we having ill of the flux were pretty well recovered the repairs were in forwardness and the stores ready to be taken on board at a moment's notice when news was brought us that an express was arrived at Table Bay from England in the Sibbald frigate which had only been ten weeks from Plymouth and that she was to return again as soon as she had delivered her dispatches Both Captains went instantly to learn the contents and on their return orders were given to prepare as fast as possible to sail This was joyful news The substance of these dispatches related chiefly to the course the East Indiamen were to steer to fall in with the convoy appointed to meet them with some instructions for our Commodore respecting the papers which were to be transmitted to the Admiralty which were all put on board the frigate and Mr Portlock Master's mate embarked along with them  On the th they set sail but it was  The th of May before we were in readiness to follow About noon on that day the signal was  made for unmooring We had now live sheep on board and the Discovery a like proportion We had all other provisions in equal plenty and we had likewise a healthy crew in high spirits wishing for nothing but a fair wind to shorten our voyage but that was not yet to be obtained We had scarce saluted the garrison on taking leave when the wind died away and a great swell ensued which continued till  The th when the snow came in sight which  e spoke with on the th of April We sent our pinnace for news from sea but she had seen only  sail pass since we first spoke with her  On the th of April the whole crew were near being blown up by the Snow's taking fire forwards the ship was much damaged and they were putting into the Cape to resit and then were bound for St Helena  On the  th we made sail and pursued our course  without any material occurrence till  The th of June when the Discovery's boat brought us word that in  ising the great guns the carpenter's mate had his arm shattered in a shocking manner by part of the wadding being left in after a former discharge another man was slightly wounded at the same time  On the th it began to blow very hard and so continued till next day when the Discovery sprung her maintopmast and we were obliged to lieto till another was put up  On the th we crossed the line to the Northward and observed a waterspout to the N W at no great distance and for the remainder of the month had fine weather Thermometer from to ½  July the st we had the Discovery's people on  board to compare time Lat at noon N long W  On the th the ship's birthday was
