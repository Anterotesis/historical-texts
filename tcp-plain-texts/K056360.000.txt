 THE Earl of Warwick A TRAGEDY As it is perform'd at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON Printed for T DAVIES RusselStreet CoventGarden R BALDWIN PaterNosterRow and W GRIFFIN CatharineStreet in the Strand MDCCLXVI Price ONE SHILLING and SIXPENCE  Advertisement To the PUBLIC  THE author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obligation to the public for their favourable reception of THE EARL OF WARWICK He flatters himself that the license so necessary to his plan which he has taken in common with other writers in deviating from historical truth especially in a period so distant and obscure will meet with indulgence  For the many faults  of this piece he can only plead that title to  is generally extended in favour of a first essay and  that the same candour which approv'd on the stage will accompany it to the closet  He cannot without the most manifest injustice forbear to add that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers display'd by the principal actors concerned in it contributed in a great measure to the success of the performance  ERRATA  For  the blush of virgin modesty  read  the crimson glow of modesty  PROLOGUE  Written by GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  Spoken by Mr BENSLEY  SEVERE each poet's lot but sure most hard  Is the condition of the playhouse bard  Doom'd to hear all that wou'dbe critics talk  And in the gocart of dull rules to walk  "Yet authors multiply" you say 'Tis true  But what a numerous crop of critics too  Scholars alone of old durst judge and write  But now each journalist turns Stagyrite  Quintilians in each coffeehouse you meet  And many a Longinus walks the street  In Shakespear's days when his advent'rous muse  A muse of fire durst each bold licence use  Her noble ardour met no critic's phlegm  To check wild fancy or her flights condemn  Ariels and Calibans unblam'd she drew  Or goblins ghosts and witches brought to view  If to historic truth she shap'd her verse  A nation's annals freely she'd rehearse  Bring Rome's or England's story on the stage  And run in three short hours thro' half an age  Our bard all terrorstruck and fill'd with dread  In Shakespear's awful footsteps dares not tread  Thro' the wide field of hist'ry fears to stray  And builds upon one narrow spot his play  Steps not from realm to realm whole feas between  But barely changes twice or thrice his scene  While Shakespear vaults on the poetic wire  And pleas'd spectators fearfully admire  Our bard a critic pole between his hands  On the tightrope scarce balanc'd trembling stands  Slowly and cautiously his way he makes  And fears to fall at ev'ry step he takes  While then fierce Warwick he before you brings  That setterup and pullerdown of kings  With British candour dissipate his sear  An English story fits an English ear  Tho' harsh and crude you deem his first essay  A second may your favours well repay  Applause may nerve his verse and chear his heart  And teach the practice of this dangerous art  Dramatis Personae  KING EDWARD  Mr POWELL  EARL of WARWICK  Mr HOLLAND  EARL of PEMBROKE  Mr BENSLEY  EARL of SUFFOLK  Mr PACKER  MARGARET of ANJOU  Mrs YATES  LADY ELIZ GRAY  Mrs PALMER  LADY CLIFFORD  Miss PLYM  OFFICERS GUARDS c  SCENE The PALACE  THE EARL of WARWICK  ACT I  SCENE I  MARGARET of ANJOU Lady CLIFFORD  CLIFFORD  THANKS gracious heav'n my royal mistress smiles  Unusual gladness sparkles in her eye  And bids me welcome in the stranger joy  To his new mansion  MARGARET  Yes My faithful Clifford  Fortune is weary of oppressing me  Through my dark cloud of grief a chearful ray  Of light breaks forth and gilds the whole horison  CLIFFORD  Henry in chains and Edward on the throne  Of Lancaster thyself a pris'ner here  Thy captive son torn from his mother's arms  And in the tyrant's pow'r a kingdom lost  Amidst so many sorrows what new hope  Hath wrought this wond'rous change  MARGARET  That which alone  In sorrow's bitt'rest hour can minister  Sweet comfort to the daughters of affliction  And bid misfortune smile the hope of vengeance  Vengeance benignant patron of distress  Thee I have oft invoked propitious now  Thou smil'st upon me if I do not grasp  The glorious opportunity henceforth  Indignant frown and leave me to my fate  CLIFFORD  Unhappy Princess that deceiver hope  Hath often flatter'd and as oft betray'd thee  What hast thou gain'd by all its promises  What's the reward of all thy toils  MARGARET  Experience  Yes Clifford I have read th' instructive volume  Of human nature there long since have learn'd  The way to conquer men is by their passions  Catch but the ruling foible of their hearts  And all their boasted virtues shrink before you  Edward and Warwick those detested names  Too well thou know'st united to destroy me  CLIFFORD  That was indeed a fatal league  MARGARET  But mark me  If we cou'd break this adamantine chain  We might again be free this mighty warrior  This dread of kings th' unconquerable Warwick  Is plighted to the fair Elizabeth  CLIFFORD  The lady Gray you mean the beauteous widow  Whose husband fell in arms for Lancaster  MARGARET  The same my CliffordWarwick long has lov'd  CLIFFORD  And means to wed her  MARGARET  But if I have art  Or she ambition that shall never be  CLIFFORD  Can'st thou prevent it  MARGARET  Yes my Clifford Warwick  Were a mean choice for such transcendent beauty  I shall provide her with a fitter husband  A nobler far and worthier of her charms  Young Edward  CLIFFORD  Ha the king impossible  Warwick ev'n now commission'd by the state  To treat with Lewis offers England's throne  To France's daughter and e'er this perhaps  Hath sign'd the solemn contract  MARGARET  Solemn trifles  Mere cobweb tiesLove's a despotic tyrant  And laughs like other kings at public faith  When it opposes private happiness  Edward is youthful gay and amorous  His soul is ever open to the lure  Of beauty and Elizabeth hath charms  Might shake a hermit's virtue  CLIFFORD  Hath he seen  This peerless fair one  MARGARET  Yesby my contrivance  When last he hunted in the forest some  Whom I had planted there as if by chance  Alone directed led him cross the lawn  To Grafton thereev'n as my soul had wish'd  The dazzling lustre of her charms surpris'd  His unsuspecting heart  CLIFFORD  What follow'd  MARGARET  O  He gaz'd and wonder'd for a while his pride  Indignant rose and struggled with his passion  But love was soon victorious and last night  The earl of Suffolk so my trusty spies  Inform me was dispatch'd on wings of love  To plead his master's cause and offer her  The throne of England  CLIFFORD  What if she refuse  The golden bribe  MARGARET  No matter all I wish  Is but to make them foes the gen'rous Warwick  Is fiery and impatient of reproof  He will not brook a rival in his love  Though seated on a throne besides thou know'st  The haughty earl looks down with scorn on Edward  As the mere work of his allpow'rful hand  The baby monarch of his own creation  CLIFFORD  Believe me madam Edward still reveres  And loves him still as conscious of the debt  Pays him with trust and confidence their souls  Are link'd together in the strictest bonds  Of sacred friendship  MARGARET  That but serves my cause  Where ties are close and interests united  The slightest inj'ries are severely felt  Offended friendship never can forgive  CLIFFORD  Now the full prospect opens to my view  I see thy distant aim and trace the paths  Of vengeance England soon will be a scene  Of blood and horror discord's fatal torch  Once lit up it in this devoted land  What pow'r shall e'er extinguish it alas  I tremble at the consequence  MARGARET  And I  Enjoy itO 'twill be a noble contest  Of pride 'gainst pride oppression 'gainst oppression  Rise but the storm and let the waves beat high  The wreck may be our own in the warm struggle  Who knows but one or both of them may fall  And Marg'ret rise triumphant on their ruin  It must be so and see the king approaches  This way he passes from the councilmark  His downcast eye he is a stricken deer  The arrow's in his sidehe cannot 'scape  We'll meet and speak to him  CLIFFORD  What mean you madam  MARGARET  To ask himwhat I know he will refuse  That gives me fair pretext to break with him  And join the man I hate vindictive Warwick  But soft he comes  SCENE II  KING EDWARD MARGARET CLIFFORD OFFICER  EDWARD  Is Suffolk yet return'd  to an Officer  OFFICER  No my good liege  EDWARD  Go wait and bring him to me  Ex Of  I'll to my closet  Pardon me fair lady  I saw you not  MARGARET  Perhaps it is beneath  A conqu'ror to look down upon his slave  But I've a boon to ask  EDWARD  Whate'er it is  Within the limits of fair courtesy  Which honour can bestow I'll not refuse thee  MARGARET  There was a time when Margaret of Anjou  Wou'd not have deign'd to ask of Edward ought  Nor was there ought which Edward dar'd refuse her  But that is past great Warwick's arm prevail'd  And I am now your pris'ner  EDWARD  Since the hour  When fortune smil'd propitious on the cause  Of justice and gave vict'ry to our arms  You have been treated with all due respect  All your condition or your sex cou'd claim  Serv'd like a queen and lodg'd within our palace  Is there ought more you can with reason ask  Or I in prudence grant you  MARGARET  Give me back  The liberty I lost restore my son  And I may then perhaps be reconcil'd  To un usurper may withhold my vengeance  And let thee fit unpunish'd onmy throne  EDWARD  You talk too proudly madam but to shew you  I cannot fear you have your liberty  Letters this morning I receiv'd from France  Have offer'd noble ransom for your person  Without that ransomfor the soul of Edward  Is far above the sordid lust of gold  I grant itfrom this moment you are free  But for your sonI cannot part with him  MARGARET  I scorn your bounties scorn your proffer'd freedom  What's liberty to me without my child  But fate will place us soon above thy reach  Thy shortliv'd tyranny is almost past  The storm is gath'ring round thee and will burst  With tenfold vengeance on thy guilty head  EDWARD  I am not to be talk'd into submission  Nor dread the menace of a clam'rous woman  MARGARET  Thou may'st have cause to dread a woman's pow'r  The time may comemark my prophetic word  When wayward beauty shall repay with scorn  Thy fruitless vows and vindicate my wrongs  The friend thou lean'st on like a broken reed  Shall pierce thy side and fill thy soul with anguish  Keen as the pangs I feel York's perjur'd house  Shall sink to rise no more and Lancaster  With added lustre reassume the throne  Hear this and tremblegive me back my son  Or dread the vengeance of a desp'rate mother  SCENE III  EDWARD  Imperious woman but the voice of woe  Is ever clam'rous 'tis the privilege  The charter of affliction to complain  This tardy Suffolk how I long to know  Yet dread to hear my fate Elizabeth  On thee the colour of my future life  Depends for thou alone can'st make me blest  Or curs'd for everO this cruel doubt  Is worse than all my tortures but he comes  Th' ambassador of love  SCENE IV  EDWARD EARL of SUFFOLK  EDWARD  What news my Suffolk  Shall I be happy O I'm on the rack  Of expectation didst thou tell my tale  As if it were thy own and may I hope  SUFFOLK  My royal liege  EDWARD  Good Suffolk lay aside  The forms of dull respect be brief and tell me  Speak hast thou seen her will she be my queen  Quick tell me ev'ry circumstance each word  Each look each gesture didst thou mark them Suffolk  SUFFOLK  I did and will recount it alllast night  By your command in secret I repair'd  To Grafton's tufted bow'r the happy seat  Of innocence and beauty there I found  Thy soul's best hope the fair Elizabeth  Ne'er did these eyes behold such sweet perfection  I found her busy'd in the pious office  Of filial duty tending her sick father  EDWARD  That was a lucky moment to prefer  My humble suit touch but the tender string  Of soft compassion in the heart and love  Will quickly vibrate to its kindred passion  You urg'd our royal purpose then  SUFFOLK  I did  With all the warmth of friendship dwelt with pleasure  On ev'ry princely virtue that adorns  Your noble heart she listen'd with attention  And echo'd back your praises  EDWARD  Was not that  A kind propitious omen  SUFFOLK  Such indeed  Hoping to find it I call'd in the pow'rs  Of flattery to my aid and gaz'd upon her  As if confounded by her dazling beauties  Conscious she smil'd but when at length I spake  Of England's monarch sighing at her feet  The blush of virgin modesty o'erspread  Her cheek and gave new lustre to her charms  She turned aside and as she silent bow'd  Her doubtful thanks I mark'd the pearly tear  Steal down its secret track and from her breast  Heard a deep sigh she struggled to conceal  If I have any judgment or can trace  The hidden feelings of a woman's heart  Her's is already fix'd I fear my liege  With all that England all that thou coud'st give  The crown wou'd fit but heavy on her brow  EDWARD  Not heavier Suffolk than it sits on mine  My throne is irksome to me who wou'd wish  To be a sov'reign when Elizabeth  Presers a subjectThen th' impetuous Warwick  His awful virtue will chastise my weakness  I dread his censure dread his keen reproaches  And dread them more because they will be just  I've promis'd Lewis to espouse his daughter  To strengthen our alliance wou'd to heav'n  I had not If I seek this coy refuser  And break with France Warwick will take th' alarm  If once offended he's inexorable  SUFFOLK  I know him wellBelieve me Sir the high  And haughty spirit when it meets rebuke  Is easiest check'd and sinks into submission  Let him my liege who ventures to arraign  His master's conduct look into his own  There ever is a corner in the heart  Open to folly Warwick is not free  From human frailties  EDWARD  No ambition fires  His noble breast love triumphs over mine  But well thou know'st our eyes are ever open  To other's faults and shut against our own  We seldom pity woes we ne'er experienc'd  Or pardon weakness which we do not feel  He is a hero  SUFFOLK  Hero's are but men  I have some cause to think sobut of that  We'll talk another time mean while my liege  I think lord Warwick is a useful friend  EDWARD  Aye and a dangerous foe the people love  To adoration love him if he falls  From his allegiance crouds will follow him  England has long been rent by civil broils  And fain wou'd rest her in the arms of peace  Her wounds scarce clos'd shall Edward open them  And bid them bleed afresh believe me Suffolk  I wou'd not be the cause of new divisions  Amongst my people for a thousand kingdoms  SUFFOLK  'Tis nobly said and may thy grateful subjects  Revere thy virtues and reward thy love  EDWARD  O Suffolk did they know but half the cares  That wait on royalty they wou'd not grudge  Their wretched master a few private hours  Of social happinessIf France consents  I am undone and Warwick hath e'er this  Enslav'd me curse on this state policy  That binds us thus to love at second hand  Who knows but he may link me to a wretch  Wed me to folly ignorance and pride  Illnature sickness or deformity  And when I'm chain'd to mis'ry coldly tell me  To sooth my griefs 'twas for the public good  SUFFOLK  How far you have commission'd him I know not  But were I worthy to advise my liege  I wou'd not be the dupe of his ambition  But follow natures dictates and be happy  England has charms besides Elizabeth's  And beauties that  EDWARD  No more my heart is fix'd  On her alone find out this pow'rful rival  I charge thee Suffolk yet why wish to find  What found will make me wretched were he bound  In cords of tend'rest friendship round my heart  Dearer than Warwick dearer than thyself  Forgive me but I fear I shou'd abhor him  O think on something that may yet be done  To win her to my heart e'er Warwick comes  SUFFOLK  I hear he is expected every hour  EDWARD  Grant heav'n some friendly storm may yet retard him  I dread his presence here  SCENE IV  MESSENGER EDWARD SUFFOLK  MESSENGER  My liege the earl  Of Warwick is arriv'd  EDWARD  Ha when how where  Wou'd he were bury'd in the rapid waves  That brought him hither comes he here to night  MESSENGER  My liege e'er now he might have reaoh'd the palace  But that the shouting multitudes press hard  On ev'ry side and seem to worship him  SCENE V  SUFFOLK EDWARD  SUFFOLK  Such adoration  But ill befits the idol that receives it  EDWARD  What's to be done I cannot must not see him  Till all is fix'd once more my bestlov'd Suffolk  Try the soft arts of thy persuasive tongue  What method can'st thou think on to evade  This promis'd marriage with ambitious France  SUFFOLK  Summon your council lay your thoughts before them  Meet Warwick there and urge a sov'reigns right  To please himself in that which shou'd concern  Himself alonefirm Buckingham and I  Will plead your cause against the haughty Warwick  Whom I wou'd treat with cold civility  And distant state which ever angers more  Resentful spirits than the warmth of passion  EDWARD  'Tis well advis'dmeantime if possible  I will compose my troubled thoughts to rest  Suffolk adieu if Warwick asks for me  I am not well I'm hunting in the forest  I'm busystayremember what I told you  Touching the earldom which I mean to give  Her father that may bring her to the court  You understand me Suffolkfare thee well  SCENE VI  EDWARD  Why shou'd I dread to see the man I love  The man I rev'renceWarwick is not chang'd  But Edward isSuffolk I know abhors him  A fav'rite must be hatedif he urges  This dreadful contract I shall hate him too  I cannot live without Elizabeth  I'll think no moreif I must sacrifice  My friendship or my lovethe choice is made  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  WARWICK Speaking to an officer  WARWICK  'TIS well I shall attend his highness' pleasure  Comes forward  Meet me i'th' council Warwick might have claim'd  A private audienceAfter all my toils  My perils in his service 'tis a cold  Unkind reception some base whisperer  Some needy sycophant perhaps hath poison'd  My royal master's earor do I judge  Too rashly As my embassy concerns  The public welfare he wou'd honour me  With public thanksElizabeth will chide me  For this unkind delaybut honour calls  And duty to my king that task perform'd  I haste my love to happiness and thee  SCENE II  the COUNCIL CHAMBER  King EDWARD Dukes of CLARENCE and BUCKINGHAM Earls of SUFFOLK PEMBROKE c  EDWARD  Good Buckingham I thank thee for thy counsel  Nor blame thy honest warmth I love this freedom  is the birthright of an Englishman  And doth become thee what says noble Suffolk  SUFFOLK  I wou'd not cross my royal master's will  But on my soul I think this nuptial league  With France prepost'rous and impolitic  It cannot last we are by nature foes  And nought but mutual poverty and weakness  Can ever make us friendsshe wants our aid  Against the pow'rful Burgundy and therefore  Throws out this lure of beauty to ensnare you  That purpose gain'd she turns her arms against us  PEMBROKE  Why let her if she comes with hostile arm  England thank heav'n is ready to receive her  I love my country and revere my king  As much perhaps as honest Buckingham  Or my good fearful lord of Suffolk here  Who knows so well or wou'd be thought to know  What France will do hereafter yet I think  The faith of nations is a thing so sacred  It ought not to be trifled withI hate  As much as you th' unnatural forc'd alliance  And yet my lords if Warwick is empow'r'd  For so I hear he is to treat with Lewis  I know not how in honour you can swerve  From his conditions  shouting  Hark the hero comes  Those shouts proclaim him near the joyful people  Will usher in their great deliverer  As he deserves  SCENE III  KING EDWARD CLARENCE SUFFOLK BUCKINGHAM PEMBROKE WARWICK  EDWARD  Thrice welcome noble Warwick  Welcome to all  to Clarence Pembroke c  SUFFOLK  You've had my lord I fear  An arduous task which few cou'd execute  But Warwick in the council and the field  A like distinguish'd and a like successful  EDWARD  What says our cousin France  WARWICK  By me my liege  He greets you well and hopes in closer ties  United soon to wear a dearer name  At length thank heav'n the iron gates of war  Are clos'd and peace displays her silken banners  O'er the contending nations ev'ry doubt  Is now remov'd and confidence establish'd  I hope to last for ages  EDWARD  Peace my lord  Is ever welcome 'tis the gift of heav'n  The nurse of science art's fair patroness  And merit's best protector but if France  Wou'd chain us down to ignominious terms  Cramp our free commerce and infringe the rights  Of our liege subjects England may repent  Too late her rash credulity and peace  With all her blessings may be bought too dear  WARWICK  The shame wou'd then be his who made the purchase  If any doubt my faith my honest zeal  For thee and for my country let him speak  And I will answer punish me just heav'n  If in the task I have consulted ought  But England's honour and my sov'reign's glory  EDWARD  Mistake me not good Warwick well I know  Thy spotless truth thy honour and thy love  But glory has no further charms for me  Rais'd by thy pow'rful aid to England's throne  I ask no morealready I am great  As fame and fortune with their smiles can make me  And all I wish for now isto be happy  WARWICK  That too my liege hath been thy Warwick's care  Happy thou shalt be if the fairest form  That ever caught a gazing lover's eye  Join'd to the sweetest most engaging virtues  Can make thee soBona accepts with joy  Thy proffer'd hand she is indeed a gem  Fit to adorn the brightest crown to see  Is to admire her trust me England's self  The seat of beauty and the throne of love  Boasts not a fairer  EDWARD  Beauty good my lord  Is all ideal 'tis the wayward child  Of fancy shifting with the changeful wind  Of fond opinion what to you appears  The model of perfection may disgust  My strange capricious taste  WARWICK  Such charms would fix  Inconstancy itselfher winning virtues  Ev'n if her beauty fail'd would soon subdue  The rebel heart and you wou'd learn to love her  EDWARD  Is passion to be learn'd then woud'st thou make  A science of affection guide the heart  And teach it where to fix impossible  'Tis strange philosophy  Rises and comes forward  My lord of Warwick  Your zeal in England's and in Edward's cause  Merits our thanks but for th' intended marriage  With France's daughterit may never be  WARWICK  Not be it must your sacred word is pass'd  And cannot be recall'd but three days since  I sign'd the contract and my honour's pledg'd  For the performance heav'n's whilst fickle France  Is branded 'midst the nations of the earth  For breach of public faith shall we my liege  Practise ourselves the vices we condemn  Pass o'er a rival nation's ev'ry virtue  And imitate their persidy alone  EDWARD  You'll pardon me my lord I thought it part  Of a king's pow'r to have a will to see  With his own eyes and in life's little feast  To cater for himself but 'tis it seems  A privilege his servants can refuse him  WARWICK  And so they oughtthe king who cannot conquer  His private int'rest for the public welfare  Knows not his duty  EDWARD  Kings my lord are born  With passions feelings heartslike other men  Nor see I yet why Edward's happiness  Must fall a sacrifice to Warwick's honour  WARWICK  My honour Sir is your's my cause your own  Who sent me and whose image did I bear  The image of a great and glorious king  Or of a weak and wav'ring boyhenceforth  Choose from the herd of fawning sycophants  Some needy slave for your mock ambassys  To do your work and stain the name of England  With foul reproachEdward I blush for thee  And for my country from this hour expect  From injur'd France contempt with deep resentment  For broken faith and enmity eternal  EDWARD  Eternal be it then for as I prize  My inward peace beyond the pomp of state  And all the tinsel glare of fond ambition  I will not wed her Gracious heav'n what am I  The meanest peasant in my realm may chuse  His rustic bride and share with her the sweets  Of mutual friendship and domestic bliss  Why shou'd my happier subjects then deny me  The common rights the privilege of nature  And in a land of freedom thus conspire  To make their king the only slave amongst 'em  WARWICK  The worst of slaves is he whom passion rules  Uncheck'd by reason and the pow'rful voice  Of friendship which I fear is heard no more  By thoughtless Edward'tis the curse of kings  To be surrounded by a venal herd  Of flatterers that sooth his darling vices  And rob their master of his subjects love  Nay frown not Sirs supported as ye are  I fear you notwhich of this noble train  These wellbeloved counsellors and friends  Assembled here to witness my disgrace  Have urg'd to this base unmanly falsehood  Shame on you all to stain the spotless mind  Of uncorrupted youth undo the work  Of Warwick's friendly hand and give him back  A sov'reign so unlike the noble Edward  SUFFOLK  My lord we thank you for the kind suggestion  Howe'er illfounded and when next we meet  To give our voice in ought that may concern  The public weal no doubt shall ask your leave  E'er we proceed  PEMBROKE  My lord of Suffolk speak  But for yourself Warwick hath too much cause  To be offended in my poor opinion  Whate'er you courtiers think the best support  Of England's throne are equity and truth  Nor will I hold that man my sov'reign's friend  Who shall exhort him to forsake his word  And play the hypocrite what tye shall bind  The subject to obedience when his king  Bankrupt in honour gives the royal sanction  To perfidy and falshood  BUCKINGHAM  It becomes  But ill the earl of Pembroke  EDWARD  Good my lords  Let us have no dissentions here we met  For other purposessome few days hence  We shall expect your counsel in affairs  Of momentfor the present urge no further  This matterfare ye well  The council break up and disperse  EDWARD comes up to Warwick  Lord Warwick keep  In narrower bounds that proud impetuous temper  It may be fatal there are private reasons  When time befits we shall impart them to you  Meanwhileif you have friendship love or duty  No more of BonaI'm determin'd  SCENE IV  WARWICK  So  'Tis well 'tis very well I have deserv'd it  I've borne this callow eagle on my wing  And now he spurns me from him 'tis a change  I little look'd for and sits heavy on me  Alas how doubly painful is the wound  When 'tis inflicted by the hand we love  Cruel ungrateful Edward  Ha who's here  The captive queen if she has ought to ask  Of me she comes in luckless hour for I  Am pow'rless now  SCENE V  MARGARET of ANJOU WARWICK  WARWICK  Will Margaret of Anjou  Thus deign to visit her acknowledg'd foe  MARGARET  Alas my lord inured to wretchedness  As I am and familiar with misfortune  I harbour no resentment have long since  Forgot that ever Warwick was my foe  And only wish to prove myself his friend  WARWICK  Talk not of friendship 'tis an empty name  And lives but in idea once indeed  I thought I had a friend  MARGARET  Whose name wasEdward  Read I aright my lord and am I not  A shrew'd diviner yes that downcast eye  And gloomy aspect say I am you look  As if the idol made by your own hands  Had fallen upon and crushed you is't not so  WARWICK  Amazement nought escapes thy piercing eye  And penetrating judgment 'tis too true  I am a poor dishonour'd slave  Not worth thy seeking leave me for the tide  Of court preferment flows another way  MARGARET  The feast perhaps you have provided suits not  With Edward's nicer palate he disdains  How sweet soe'er to taste a foreign banquet  And relishes no dainties but his own  Am I again mistaken  WARWICK  Sure thou deal'st  With some allknowing spirit who imparts  Each secret purpose to thee else how knew'st thou  That Edward refus'd to wed the princess  MARGARET  O it requires no supernatural aid  To trace his actions nor has Marg'ret trod  The paths of life with unobserving eye  I could have told you this long sincefor know  The choice is made the nuptial rites prepar'd  Which but for your return as unexpected  As undesired had been e'er this complete  And as in duty bound you then had paid  Your due obedience to ourEnglish queen  WARWICK  Determin'd say'st thou gracious heaven 'tis well  I am return'd  MARGARET  Indeed my lord you came  A little out of season 'twas unkind  To interrupt your master's happiness  To blast so fair a passion in its bloom  And check the rising harvest of his love  WARWICK  Marg'ret I thank theeyes it must be so  His blushes his confusion all confirm it  And yet I am amaz'd astonish'd  MARGARET  Wherefore  Is it so strange a youthful prince shou'd love  Is it so strange a mind unfraught with wisdom  And lifted high with proud prosperity  Shou'd follow pleasure thro' the crooked paths  Of falshood shou'd forsake a useless friend  For the warm joys of animating beauty  WARWICK  No but 'tis strange that he who knows how much  He ow'd to Warwick he who ev'ry hour  Tastes the rich stream of bounty should forget  The fountain whence it flow'd  MARGARET  Alas my lord  Had you been chasten'd in affliction's school  As I have been and taught by sad experience  To know mankind you had not fall'n a prey  To such delusion  WARWICK  Was it like a friend  Was it like Edward to conceal his love  Some base insinuating artful woman  With borrow'd charms perhaps  MARGARET  Hold hold my lord  Be not too rash who fights in darkness oft  May wound a bosom friend perhaps you wrong  The best and most accomplish'd of her sex  WARWICK  Know you the lady  MARGARET  But as fame reports  Of peerless beauty and transcendent charms  But for her virtuesI must ask ofyou  WARWICK  Of me what virtues whose  MARGARET  Elizabeth's  WARWICK  Amazement no it must not it cannot be  Elizabeth he cou'd not dare not do it  Confusion I shall soon discover all  aside  But what have I to do with Edward's choice  Whoe'er she be if he refuses mine  MARGARET  Dissimulation sits but ill my lord  On minds like yours I am a poor weak woman  And so it seems you think me but suppose  That same allknowing spirit which you rais'd  Who condescends so kindly to instruct me  Shou'd whisperWarwick knows the pow'r of love  As well as Edward that Elizabeth  Was his first wish the idol of his soul  What say youmight I venture to believe it  WARWICK  Marg'ret you might for 'tis in vain to hide  A thought from thee it might have told you too  If it be so there is not such a wretch  On earth as Warwick give me but the proof  MARGARET  Lord Suffolk was last night dispatch'd to Grafton  To offer her a share in Edward's throne  WARWICK  Which she refus'd did she not Marg'ret say  She did  MARGARET  I know not that my lord but crowns  Are dazzling meteors in a woman's eye  Such strong temptations few of us I fear  Have virtue to resist  WARWICK  Elizabeth  Has every virtue I'll not doubt her faith  MARGARET  Edward is young and handsome  WARWICK  Curses on him  Think'st thou he knew my fond attachment there  MARGARET  O passing well my lord and when 'twas urg'd  How deeply 'twou'd affect you swore by heav'n  Imperious Warwick ne'er shou'd be the master  Of charms like hers 'twas happiness he said  Beyond a subject's merit to deserve  Beyond his hope to wish for or aspire to  WARWICK  But for that Warwick Edward's self had been  A subject stillandmay be sohereafter  Thou smil'st at my misfortunes  MARGARET  I must smile  When I behold a subtle statesman thus  Duped and deluded by a shallow boy  Sent on a fruitless errand to expose  His country and himselfit was indeed  A master stroke of policy beyond  One shou'd have thought the reach of years so green  As Edward's to dispatch the weeping lover  And seize the glorious opportunity  Of tamp'ring with his mistress here at home  WARWICK  Did Nevil Rutland Clifford bleed for this  MARGARET  For this doth Henry languish in a dungeon  And wretched Marg'ret live a life of woe  For this you gave the crown to pious Edward  And thus he thanks you for his kingdom  WARWICK  Crowns  Are baubles fit for children like himself  To play with I have scatter'd many of them  But thus to cross me in my dearest hope  The sweet reward of all my toils for him  And for his country if I suffer it  If I forgive him may I live the scorn  Of men a branded coward and old age  Without or love or rev'rence be my portion  Henceforth good Marg'ret know me for thy friend  We will have noble vengeanceare there not  Still left among'st the lazy sons of peace  Some busy spirits who wish well to thee  And to thy cause  MARGARET  There are resentment sleeps  But is not dead beneath the hollow cover  Of loyalty the slumb'ring ashes lye  Unheeded Warwick's animating breath  Will quickly light them into flames again  WARWICK  Then Edward from this moment I abjure thee  O I will make thee ample recompence  For all the wrongs that I have done the house  Of Lancastergo summon all thy friends  Be quick good Marg'ret haste e'er I repent  And yield my soul to perjur'd York again  The king I think gives you free liberty  To range abroad  MARGARET  He doth and I will use it  As I wou'd ever use the gift of foes  To his destruction  WARWICK  That archpandar Suffolk  That minister of vicebut time is precious  Tomorrow Marg'ret we will meet in private  And have some further conference meantime  Devise consult use ev'ry means against  Our common foe remember from this hour  Warwick's thy friendbe secret and be happy  SCENE VI  MARGARET  What easy fools these cunning statesmen are  With all their policy when once they fall  Into a woman's pow'r This gallant leader  This blust'ring Warwick how the hero shrunk  And lessen'd to my sightElizabeth  I thank thee for thy wonderworking charms  The time perhaps may come when I shall stand  Indebted to them forthe throne of England  Proud York beware for Lancaster's great name  Shall rise superior in the lists of fame  Fortune that long had frown'd shall smile at last  And make amends for all my sorrows past  END of the SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  MARGARET CLIFFORD Attendants  MARGARET  to a gentleman  DISPATCH these letters strait to Scotlandthis  To the French envoythese to th' earl of Pembroke  turning to lady Clifford  Thus far my friend hath fortune favour'd us  Beyond our hopes the soul of haughty Warwick  Is all on fire and puling Edward loves  With most romantic ardourO my Clifford  You wou'd have smil'd to see how artfully  I play'd upon him flatter'd sooth'd provok'd  And wrought him to my purpose we are link'd  In firmest bonds of amity and love  CLIFFORD  Hath Warwick then so soon forgot his Edward  Think'st thou the frantic earl will e'er exert  His illdirected powers to pull down  The royal structure which himself had rais'd  Never  MARGARET  What is there disappointed love  And unrestrain'd ambition will not do  I tell thee we are sworn and cordial friends  CLIFFORD  Thou know'st he hates the house of Lancaster  MARGARET  No matterhe has marvellous good skill  In making kings and Ihave business for him  CLIFFORD  And can'st thou then forget the cruel wrongs  The deepfelt inj'ries of oppressive Warwick  To join the hand that forg'd thy husband's chains  And rob'd thee of a crown  MARGARET  But whatmy Clifford  If the same hand that ravish'd shou'd restore it  'Tis a court friendship and may last as long  As int'rest shall direct I've not forgot  No nor forgiv'n I hate abhor detest him  But I will use him as my instrument  My necessary tool I'll make him draw  His trait'rous sword to sheath it in the breast  Of him he loves then point it to his own  Yes Clifford I have twin'd me round his heart  Like the fell serpent crept into his bosom  That I might sting more surely he shall perish  I keep him for the last dear precious morsel  To crown the glorious banquet of revenge  CLIFFORD  'Tis what he merits from us yet th' attempt  Were dang'rous he is still the people's idol  MARGARET  And so perhaps shall Marg'ret be applause  Waits on success the fickle multitude  Like the light straw that floats along the stream  Glide with the current still and follow fortune  Our prospect brightens every hourthe people  Are ripe for a revolt by civil wars  Long time inur'd to savage scenes of plunder  And desolation they delight in war  These English heroes when once flesh'd with slaughter  Like the keen mastiff lose not soon the track  Of vengeance nor forget the taste of blood  CLIFFORD  What further succours have we to depend on  Beside earl Warwick's  MARGARET  O his name alone  Will be an army to us  CLIFFORD  If we have it  Resentment is a shortliv'd passionwhat  If Warwick should relent and turn again  To Edward  MARGARET  Then I have a bosom friend  That shall be ready to reward him for it  But I have better hopes without his aid  We are not friendless Scotland's hardy sons  Who smile at danger and defy the storm  Will leave their barren mountains to defend  That liberty they love add too the aid  Of gallant Pembroke and the pow'rs which France  Will send to vindicate her injur'd honour  E'er Edward can collect his force and take  The field we shall be thirty thousand strong  CLIFFORD  But what becomes of the young prince  MARGARET  Aye there  I am indeed unhappy O my child  How shall I set him freehear nature hear  A mother's pray'r O guide me with thy counsel  And teach me how to save my darling boy  Aye now I have it monitress divine  I thank theeyes I wait but for the means  Of his escape then fly this hated palace  Nor will return till I can call it mine  SCENE II  EDWARD SUFFOLK  EDWARD  I fear we've gone too far th' indignant Warwick  Ill brook'd our steady purpose mark'd you Suffolk  With what an eye of scorn he turn'd him from us  And lowr'd defiancethat prophetic woman  Half of her curse already is fulfill'd  And I have lost my friend  SUFFOLK  Some friends perhaps  Are better lost you'll pardon me my liege  But were it fitting I could tell a tale  Wou'd soon convince youWarwick is as weak  EDWARD  As Edward thou woud'st say  SUFFOLK  But 'twill distress  Thy noble heart too much I dare not Sir  Yet one day you must know it  EDWARD  Then by thee  Let it be told me Suffolk thy kind hand  Will best administer the bitter draught  Go on my Suffolk speak I charge thee speak  SUFFOLK  That rival whom you wish'd me to discover  EDWARD  Aye what of him quick tell me hast thou found  The happy traitor give me but to know  That I may wreak my speedy vengeance on him  SUFFOLK  Suppose that rival were the man whom most  You lov'd the man perhaps whom most you fear'd  Suppose 'twereWarwick  EDWARD  Ha it cannot be  I would not think it for a thousand worlds  Warwick in love with her impossible  Now Suffolk do I fear thou speak'st from envy  And jealous hatred at the noble Warwick  Not from the love of justice or of Edward  Where didst thou learn this falshood  SUFFOLK  From the lips  Of truth from one whose honour and whose word  You will not question fromElizabeth  EDWARD  From her nay then I fearit must be so  SUFFOLK  When last I saw her for again I went  By your command tho' hopeless of success  With all the little eloquence that I  Was master of I urg'd your ardent passion  Told her how much how tenderly you lov'd her  And press'd with eagerness to know the cause  Of her unkind refusal till at length  Reluctantly with blushes she confess'd  There was a causeshe thank'd you for your goodness  'Twas more she said much more than she deserv'd  She ever shou'd revere her king and if  She had a heart to give it shou'd beEdward's  EDWARD  So kind and yet so cruel well go on  SUFFOLK  Then told me all the story of her love  That Warwick long had woo'd herthat her hand  Was promis'd soon as he return'd from France  Though once her father cruelly opposed it  They were by his consent to be united  EDWARD  O never Suffolk may I live to see  That dreadful hour designing hypocrite  Are these his arts is this the friend I lov'd  By heav'n she shall be mine I will assert  A sov'reign's right and tear her from himwhat  If he rebelanother civil war  'Tis terribleO that I cou'd shake off  This cumbrous garb of majesty that clings  So close around me meet him man to man  And try who best deserves her but when kings  Grow mad their guiltless subjects pay the forfeit  Horrible thoughtgood Suffolk for a while  I wou'd be privatetherefore wait without  Let me have no intruders above all  Keep Warwick from my sight  SCENE III  WARWICK EDWARD  WARWICK  Behold him here  No welcome guest it seems unless I ask  My lord of Suffolk's leavethere was a time  When Warwick wanted not his aid to gain  Admission here  EDWARD  There was a time perhaps  When Warwick more desired and moredeserv'd it  WARWICK  Never I've been a foolish faithful slave  All my best years the morning of my life  Hath been devoted to your service what  Are now the fruits disgrace and infamy  My spotless name which never yet the breath  Of calumny had tainted made the mock  For foreign fools to carp at but 'tis fit  Who trust in princes shou'd be thus rewarded  EDWARD  I thought my lord I had full well repay'd  Your services with honours wealth and pow'r  Unlimited thy alldirecting hand  Guided in secret ev'ry latent wheel  Of government and mov'd the whole machine  Warwick was all in all and pow'rless Edward  Stood like a cypher in the great account  WARWICK  Who gave that cypher worth and seated thee  On England's throne thy undistinguish'd name  Had rotted in the dust from whence it sprang  And moulder'd in oblivion had not Warwick  Dug from its sordid mine the useless ore  And stamp'd it with a diadem Thou know'st  This wretched country doom'd perhaps like Rome  To fall by its own selfdestroying hand  Tost for so many years in the rough sea  Of civil discord but for me had perish'd  In that distressful hour I seiz'd the helm  Bade the rough waves subside in peace and steer'd  Your shatter'd vessel safe into the harbour  You may despise perhaps that useless aid  Which you no longer want but know proud youth  He who forgets a friend deserves a foe  EDWARD  Know too reproach for benefits receiv'd  Pays ev'ry debt and cancels obligation  WARWICK  Why that indeed is frugal honesty  A thrifty saving knowledge when the debt  Grows burthensome and cannot be discharg'd  A spunge will wipe out all and cost you nothing  EDWARD  When you have counted o'er the numerous train  Of mighty gifts your bounty lavish'd on me  You may remember next the inj'ries  Which I have done you let me know 'em all  And I will make you ample satisfaction  WARWICK  Thou can'st not thou hast robb'd me of a jewel  It is not in thy pow'r to restore  I was the first shall future annals say  That broke the sacred bond of public trust  And mutual confidence ambassadors  In after times mere instruments perhaps  Of venal statesmen shall recal my name  To witness that they want not an example  And plead my guilt to sanctify their own  Amidst the herd of mercenary slaves  That haunt your court cou'd none be found but Warwick  To be the shameless herald of a lye  EDWARD  And woud'st thou turn the vile repoach on me  If I have broke my faith and stain'd the name  Of England thank thy own pernicious counsels  That urg'd me to it and extorted from me  A cold consent to what my heart abhor'd  WARWICK  I've been abus'd insulted and betray'd  My injur'd honour cries aloud for vengeance  Her wounds will never close  EDWARD  These gusts of passion  Will but inflame them if I have been right  Inform'd my lord besides these dang'rous scars  Of bleeding honour you have other wounds  As deep tho' not so fatal such perhaps  As none but fair Elizabeth can cure  WARWICK  Elizabeth  EDWARD  Nay start not I have cause  To wonder most I little thought indeed  When Warwick told me I might learn to love  He was himself so able to instruct me  But I've discovered all  WARWICK  And so have I  Too well I know thy breach of friendship there  Thy fruitless base endeavours to supplant me  EDWARD  I scorn it sirElizabeth hath charms  And I have equal right with you t'admire them  Nor see I ought so godlike in the form  So allcommanding in the name of Warwick  That he alone shou'd revel in the charms  Of beauty and monopolize perfection  I knew not of your love  WARWICK  By heav'n 'tis false  You knew it all and meanly took occasion  Whilst I was busy'd in the noble office  Your grace thought fit to honour me withal  To tamper with a weak unguarded woman  To bribe her passions high and basely steal  A treasure which your kingdom cou'd not purchase  EDWARD  How know you that but be it as it may  I had a right nor will I tamely yield  My claim to happiness the privilege  To choose the partner of my throne and bed  It is a branch of my prerogative  WARWICK  Prerogativewhat's that the boast of tyrants  A borrow'd jewel glitt'ring in the crown  With specious lustre lent but to betray  You had it sir and hold itfrom the people  EDWARD  And therefore do I prize it I wou'd guard  Their liberties and they shall strengthen mine  But when proud faction and her rebel crew  Insult their sov'reign trample on his laws  And bid defiance to his pow'r the people  In justice to themselves will then defend  His cause and vindicate the rights they gave  WARWICK  Go to your darling people then for soon  If I mistake not 'twill be needful try  Their boasted zeal and see if one of them  Will dare to lift his arm up in your cause  If I forbid them  EDWARD  Is it so my lord  Then mark my words I've been your slave too long  And you have rul'd me with a rod of iron  But henceforth know proud peer I am thy master  And will be so the king who delegates  His pow'r to other's hands but ill deserves  The crown he wears  WARWICK  Look well then to your own  It sits but loosely on your head for know  The man who injur'd Warwick never pass'd  Unpunish'd yet  EDWARD  Nor he who threaten'd Edward  You may repent it Sirmy guards thereseize  This traitor and convey him to the tow'r  There let him learn obedience  Guards enter seize Warwick and endeavour to disarm him  WARWICK  Slaves stand off  If I must yield my sword I'll give it him  Whom it so long has serv'd there's not a part  In this old faithful steel that is not stain'd  With English blood in grateful Edward's cause  Give me my chains they are the bands of friendship  Of a king's friendship for his sake a while  I'll wear them  EDWARD  Hence away with him  WARWICK  'Tis well  Exert your pow'r it may not last you long  For know tho' Edward may forget his friend  That England will notnow sir I attend you  Exit Warwick  EDWARD  Presumptuous rebelha who's here  SCENE IV  MESSENGER EDWARD  MESSENGER  My liege  Queen Marg'ret with the prince her son are fled  In a few hours she hopes for so we learn  From those who have pursued her to be join'd  By th' earl of Warwick in his name it seems  She has already rais'd three thousand men

Where is my brother Clarence Buckingham  And Pembroke we must check this foul rebellion  SCENE V  EDWARD SUFFOLK  SUFFOLK  My liege the duke of Clarence  EDWARD  What of him  SUFFOLK  Hath left the court this moment I beheld him  In conf'rence deep with Pembroke who it seems  Is Marg'ret's firmest friend 'tis whisper'd both  Will join the queen  EDWARD  Well'tis no matter I  Have deeper cause for grief he cannot feel  A brother's falshood who has lost a friend  A friend like WarwickSuffolk thou behold'st me  Betray'd deserted by the man I lov'd  Treated with cold indifference by her  Whom I ador'd forsaken by my brother  And threaten'd by the subjects I protect  Oppress'd on every side but thou shalt see  I have a soul superior to misfortunes  Tho' rebel Clarence wrings my tortur'd heart  And faithless Warwick braves me we will yet  Maintain our rightcome on my friend thou know'st  Without his boasted aid I cou'd have gain'd  The crown without him now I will preserve it  END of the THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE  THE TOWER  WARWICK  MISTAKEN mortals plan delusive schemes  Of bliss and call futurity their own  Yet are not masters of a momentthis  Was the appointed time the very day  Which shou'd have join'd me to Elizabeth  In nuptial bondsO cruel memory  Do not torment meif there be a crime  Of deeper dye than all the guilty train  Of human vices 'tisingratitude  'Tis now two years since Henry lost the crown  And here he is ev'n in this very prison  A fellow captive now disgraceful thought  How will he smile to meet his conqu'ror here  O for that stoic apathy which lulls  The drowsy soul to sweet forgetfulness  But 'twill not beElizabeth where art thou  Perhaps with EdwardO that thought distracts me  It is I fear as Marg'ret said she's false  But when I look on these can I expect  To find one virtue left in human kind  My Pembroke too am I so soon forgotten  O no he comes  SCENE II  PEMBROKE WARWICK  PEMBROKE  My friend  WARWICK  My Pembroke welcome  Thee I have ever found most just and kind  But in the darkness of adversity  The jewel friendship shines with double lustre  PEMBROKE  I am not of the infect train that bask  In fortune's sunshine and when ev'ning damps  Arise are seen no more no Warwick what  I speak I mean you have been hardly treated  WARWICK  O Pembroke didst thou know but half the wrongs  That I have suffer'd thou wou'dst pity me  PEMBROKE  I wou'd do more much more my Warwick he  Who only pities but insults the wretched  I come with nobler views I come to tell thee  That I have felt thy inj'ries as my own  And will revenge them too  WARWICK  How kind thou art  To feel for Warwick  PEMBROKE  Ev'ry honest breast  Must feel the inj'ries that a good man suffers  Thine is the common cause of all adieu  To English freedom when our liberty  Shall be dependent on a sov'reign's nod  When years of honest service shall be paid  With infamy and chains  WARWICK  I've not deserv'd them  PEMBROKE  Nor shalt thou wear them long

Wou'd soon forget a brotherbut say Pembroke  How stands the duke of Buckingham  PEMBROKE  Fast bound  To Edward he and that smooth courtier Suffolk  Are the two rotten pillars that support  His tott'ring throne but Marg'ret  WARWICK  Aye how fares  My new ally has she escaped the tyrant  PEMBROKE  She has and by some wond'rous means contriv'd  To free her captive son  WARWICK  Tho' I abhor  I must admire that enterprising woman  Her active mind is ever on the wing  In search of fresh expedients to recover  The crown she lost  PEMBROKE  Already she has rais'd  A pow'rful army all the secret foes  Of York's ambitious line rush forth in crowds  And join her standard e'er tomorrow's sun  Shall dawn upon us she will set thee free  WARWICK  O Pembroke nothing wounds the gen'rous mind  So deep as obligations to a foe  Is there no way to liberty my friend  But through the bloody paths of civil war  PEMBROKE  I fear there is not  WARWICK  Then it must be so  I cou'd have wish'dbut freedom and revenge  On any terms are welcome  PEMBROKE  Here then join we  Our hands  WARWICK  Our hearts  PEMBROKE  Now Warwick be thou firm  In thy resolves let no unmanly fears  No foolish fond remembrance of past friendship  Unnerve thy arm or shake thy steady purpose  WARWICK  No by my wrongs it shall not once thou know'st  I lov'd him but too well and these vile chains  Are my rewardO give me but the use  Of this once pow'rful arm and thou shalt see  How it shall punish falshoodare thy forces  Prepar'd  PEMBROKE  They are and wait but for my orders  Clarence will join us soon our first great end  Is to secure thy liberty that done  We haste to seize the palace and redeem  The fair Elizabeth  WARWICK  Redeem her ha  Is she a captive too  PEMBROKE  A willing slave  A gay state pris'ner left to roam at large  O'er the young monarch's palace  WARWICK  Aye my Pembroke  That's more inviting than a prisonO  She's false she's falsewho sent her there  PEMBROKE  She came  It seems to thank him for his royal bounties  To her good father the new earl of Rivers  Who will no doubt persuade her to accept  WARWICK  Of Edward's handdistraction fly my friend  Haste thee to Marg'ret tell her if she hopes  For Warwick's aid she must release him now  E'er Edward's illtim'd mercy shall prevent her  PEMBROKE  I go my friend adieu when next we meet  I hope to bring thee liberty

sure  It cannot be admit her sirwhy what  Exit Mess  Cou'd bring her here Edward has sent her hither  To see if I will crouch to him for pardon  Be still my jealous heart  SCENE IV  ELIZABETH WARWICK  ELIZABETH  My Warwick  WARWICK  'Tis a grace I look'd not for  That a fair fav'rite who so late had tasted  The pleasures of a court shou'd condescend  To visit thus a poor abandon'd captive  ELIZABETH  I come to take my portion of misfortune  To pour the balm of comfort in and heal  If possible the wounds which I had made  Too well I know I was the fatal cause  Of all thy sorrowsbut the noble Edward  For so indeed he is  WARWICK  And art thou come  To plead the cause of him who sent me hither  ELIZABETH  I came to be the messenger of peace  To calm thy troubled soul and give thee rest  To teach my Warwick to forget his wrongs  WARWICK  Forget my wrongs was that thy errand here  To teach me low submission to a tyrant  To ask forgiveness kneel and deprecate  The wrath of blust'ring Edward If thou com'st  On terms like these to bring me freedom know  It will not be accepted now I see  Thro' all your arts by heav'n I'd rather lose  A thousand lives than owe one to his bounty  ELIZABETH  Either my Warwick is much chang'd and so  I fear he is or he wou'd never talk  Thus coldly to me never wou'd despise  A life so precious if he knew how much  Elizabeth had suffer'd to preserve it  The gallant Edward won by my entreaties  WARWICK  Entreaties didst thou then descend so low  As to entreat him for me  ELIZABETH  Hadst thou seen  When I implor'd him to forgive my Warwick  How kind he look'd how his repenting heart  Heav'd with the pangs of agonizing friendship  Thou wou'd'st have pity'd him  WARWICK  Deceitful woman  I see thy falshood now I am betray'd  And thou art leagu'd with Edward to destroy me  Go to your royal lover and unite  Those only fit companions for each other  A broken friendship and a perjur'd love  Give up discarded Warwick and to make  The compact firm cement it with my blood  ELIZABETH  I thought the soul of Warwick far above  Such mean suspicionsshall the man whose truth  Whose constancy and love have been so long  My bright example shall he stoop so low  As thus to listen to an idle tale  Told by some prating courtier if indeed  Thou cou'd'st believe it I should pity thee  WARWICK  Where is your father the new earl of Rivers  Why sends he not his forces to our aid  ELIZABETH  He cannot honour gratitude forbid  That he shou'd lift up his rebellious arm  Against his benefactor well thou know'st  Of late when civil discord reign'd among'st us  He fought with Henry and with Henry fell  When injur'd Edward gen'rously forgave  Restor'd his forfeit lands and late advanc'd him  To rank and title  WARWICK  Infamy and shame  The common nets which fearful knav'ry spreads  To catch ambition's fools mean sordid bribes  We know the treasure they were mean't to purchase  ELIZABETH  Unkind suggestion how have I deserv'd it  Have I for this refus'd a youthful monarch  And spurn'd his offer'd sceptre at my feet  To be reproach'd at last by cruel Warwick  Had I once listen'd to him had these eyes  Been dazzled with the splendor of a court  I need not thus have chang'd it for a dungeon  But since I am suspected witness heav'n  And witness Warwick to my vows henceforth  Dear as thou art I cast thee from my love  Elizabeth will never weda traitor  WARWICK  Am I awake and did Elizabeth  Say she wou'd never wed her faithful Warwick  Then bear me witness too all judging heav'n  Here yield I up all visionary dreams  Of future bliss of liberty or life  Ev'n the sweet hope of vengeance that alone  Sustain'd my spirit loses all its charms  I wish'd for freedom but to purchase thine  For life but to enjoy it with my love  And she disclaims me  WARWICK  Heav'n forbid O Warwick  Let not the tide of passion thus overwhelm  Thy reason  WARWICK  Can'st thou pardon me thou know'st  Th' unguarded warmth the weakness of my nature  I wou'd not wrong thee but I've been so oft  So cruelly deceiv'd  ELIZABETH  I know thou hast  But never by Elizabeth  WARWICK  O no  It is impossible that perfidy  Shou'd wear a form like thine  Looking at her  I wonder not  That Edward lov'd no when I look on thee  All beauteous all enchanting as thou art  By heav'n I think I cou'd almost forgive him  ELIZABETH  Then wherefore not be reconcil'd  WARWICK  To whom  The author of my wrongs It cannot be  Know I have promis'd Marg'ret to destroy him  ELIZABETH  Destroy thy friend ungen'rous cruel Warwick  Is't not enough that thou hast triumph'd here  Already we have pierc'd his noble heart  With the keen pangs of disappointed love  And woud'st thou wound his breast with added sorrows  Woud'st thou involve a nation in his ruin  WARWICK  Elizabeth no more alas too well  Thou know'st there is a pow'rful advocate  In Warwick's breast that pleads for perjur'd Edward  ELIZABETH  Cherish the soft emotion O my Warwick  WARWICK  That angel form can never plead in vain  But then my friendswhere is my solemn vow  To Marg'ret and to Pembroke there's the tie  My honour's dearer to me  ELIZABETH  Than thy love  Dearer much dearer than Elizabeth  But I have done farewel my lord I see  Thy deep resentment is not to be mov'd  By my weak influence o'er thee  Going  WARWICK  Stay I charge thee  ELIZABETH  What is this phantom honour this proud idol  That tramples thus on ev'ry humble virtue  This cruel bloody Molock that delights  In human sacrifice O wou'd to heav'n  I were its only victim but with me  You offer up your country and your king  WARWICK  Think on my vow think on my promise giv'n  ELIZABETH  Thy league with Marg'ret must be fatal grant  We should succeed and Lancaster once more  Assume the throne how dear the victory  That's purchas'd with our fellowsubjects blood  Alas such triumphs make the conqu'ror weep  But if we fail  WARWICK  Impossible  ELIZABETH  O think  Betimes what dreadful punishments await  The vanquish'd rebel thou perhaps my love  Shalt then be doom'd on th' ignominious block  To fall inglorious and when thou art gone  Who shall defend thy poor Elizabeth  WARWICK  Alarming thought It staggers my firm purpose  And makes me half a villain  SCENE V  WARWICK ELIZABETH an OFFICER  OFFICER  Madam the king demands your presence I  Have orders to convey you to the palace  WARWICK  And wilt thou leave me  ELIZABETH  This my Warwick this  Is the decisive moment now determine  Accept of mercy e'er it be too late  E'er hasty EdwardShall I say thou wilt  Return to thy obedience and receive  Thy pardon shall I speak my love  WARWICK  Perhaps  I may accept it if 'tis brought by thee  ELIZABETH  Then we shall meet in happiness  WARWICK  Farewel  SCENE VI  WARWICK  Now to those worst companions in affliction  My own sad thoughts again they're gloomy all  And like my habitation full of horror  I like not Edward's messageif he hears  My league with Margaret he still has pow'r  To make me feel his rage I have deserv'd it  a trampling heard without  Methought I heard a noisethis way they come  Perhaps it is the messenger of death  SCENE VII  PEMBROKE WARWICK  PEMBROKE  The messenger of vengeancesee her sword  Accept it and be free  offers the sword  WARWICK  First let me know  To whom I am indebted for't  PEMBROKE  To me  Soon as the rumour of thy foul disgrace  Had reach'd the public ear th' impatient people  Uncertain of thy fate tumultuous throng'd  Around the palace and demanded thee  Give us our Warwick give us back they cry'd  Our hero our deliv'rerI step'd forth  And bade them instant if they wish'd to save  The best of men from infamy and death  To follow me transported they obey'd  I led them hither forced the prison gates  And brought thee thisdirect it as thou wilt  Gives the sword  WARWICK  Welcome once more thou dearest gift of heav'n  Immortal liberty my friend I thank thee  O Pembroke woud'st thou had'st been here my love  My dear Elizabeth is true  PEMBROKE  At least  You think so  WARWICK  She has told me such sweet truths  Edward repents him sorely he is griev'd  At his ingratitude  PEMBROKE  And well he may  I fear thou art betray'd alas my Warwick  Thy open gen'rous unsuspecting virtue  Thinks ev'ry heart as honest as thy own  Thou know'st not Edwardnor Elizabeth  The kingdom is in arms and ev'ry hour  It is expected France will join the queen  England will want its great protector's aid  Edward and Rivers have conspired to cheat  Thy credulous ear and who so fit to spread  The flimsy web as thy Elizabeth  Their fair ambassadress I see thou'rt caught  WARWICK  By heav'n it may be so I am the sport  Of fortune and of fraud  PEMBROKE  Away my friend  It is not now a time to think of her  Marg'ret supported by thy pow'rful name  And join'd by Clarence waits us at the head  Of fifteen thousand men who eager all  To crush a tyrant and pull down oppression  Attend thy wish'dfor presence not a soldier  Will act or move till Warwick shall direct them  Edward and England's fate depend on thee  WARWICK  Away my friend I'll follow thee  Exit Pembroke  Yet stop  A momentlet not passion hurry me  To base dishonourif my country calls  For Warwick's aid shall I not hear her voice  And save her Pembroke may have private views  And subtle Marg'ret tooElizabeth  I must not lose theeO direct me heav'n  END of the FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  ELIZABETH  THE royal pardon came too late and Pembroke  Already has releas'd him he is gone  Elizabeth may never see him more  A thousand

My Warwick bleeds O agonizing thought  Great God of armies whose allguiding hand  Directs the fate of nations O look down  On thy own image let not cruel discord  Divide their kindred souls in pity hear  Pour thy benignant spirit o'er their hearts  And once more knit them in the bonds of peace  SCENE II  ELIZABETH SUFFOLK  SUFFOLK  The pray'r of innocence is always heard  ELIZABETH  Ha Suffolk whither hast'st thou art thou come  SUFFOLK  I come to heal thy sorrows lovely fair one  To tell thee Edward and thy muchlov'd Warwick  Once more are friends  ELIZABETH  Indeed O welcome news  My joy's too great for utt'rance tell me Suffolk  How was it speak is Warwick safe O heav'n  SUFFOLK  A moment's patience and I'll tell thee all  Marg'ret thou know'st had rais'd a pow'rful force  That doubled Edward's troops elate with pride  And almost sure of victory she urg'd  The tardy spearmen on they rush'd as if  Secure of conquest the unhappy king  Stood nobly firm and seem'd to brave his fate  When Warwick like a guardian god appear'd  His noble mien and allcommanding look  Struck deep attention ev'ry eye was bent  Upon him and an awful silence reign'd  O'er either host he rais'd his voice on high  And stop he cry'd your sacrilegious hands  Nor touch my friend who pierces Edward's breast  Must pass through mine I rais'd him to the throne  And will support him there to you I gave  From you my fellowsoldiers I expect him  Howe'er his cruel wrongs have wounded me  He never injur'd you and Iforgive him  He spake and instant thro' the gazing croud  A murmur ran down dropp'd their nerveless arms  As if enchanted by some magic pow'r  And with one voice they cry'd long live king Edward  ELIZABETH  How pow'rful is the tongue of eloquence  When in the cause of virtuewell what sollow'd  SUFFOLK  Encourag'd by the shouting soldiers Edward  On like a modest virgin wishing came  Yet fearful Warwick with a bridegroom's speed  To meet him flew into each other's arms  They ran with speechless joy the tender scene  Affected ev'ry heart and the rough soldier  Unused to melting sympathy forgot  His ruthless nature and dissolv'd in tears  ELIZABETH  Sweet reconcilement then Elizabeth  Thou didst not plead in vain but say how brook'd  The haughty queen this unexpected change  SUFFOLK  Abash'd confounded for a while she strove  To stem the torrent but in vain then fled  Precipitate  ELIZABETH  But where O where's my Warwick  SUFFOLK  With a few chosen squadrons he pursues  The disappointed Marg'ret  ELIZABETH  O my fears  I know not why but at that hateful name  I tremble ever my foreboding heart  Presages something dreadful  SUFFOLK  Do not vex  Thy tender mind with visionary dangers  ELIZABETH  O wou'd to heav'n that he were shelter'd here  And safe within these arms  SUFFOLK  Be not alarm'd  He is the care of heav'n all good men love  All bad ones fear him  ELIZABETH  Such superior merit  Must have a thousand foes the constant mark  Of envy's poison'd darts  SUFFOLK  There Suffolk feels  The keen reproach with blushes I confess  There was a time when urg'd by fond ambition  I look'd on Warwick with a jealous eye  But this last noble deed hath won my heart  And I am now a convert to his virtues  But see the king approaches  SCENE III  EDWARD ELIZABETH  EDWARD  Health and peace  And happiness to fair Elizabeth  Thou art no stranger to the joyful news  The lustre of those speaking eyes declares it  ELIZABETH  Suffolk ev'n now hath bless'd me with the tidings  EDWARD  O 'tis amazement all Elizabeth  When last we met thou wert the suppliant now  'Tis I must ask forgiveness I who injur'd  The dearest best of men O thou hast say'd  Edward from shame and England from destruction  ELIZABETH  Did I not say my Warwick wou'd be just  EDWARD  Thou did'st and on those beauteous lips fair truth  And soft persuasion dwell long time he stood  Inflexible and deaf to friendship's voice  Listen'd to nought but all subduing love  In aftertimes thy name shall be enroll'd  Amongst the great deliv'rer's of their country  ELIZABETH  I have no title to the lavish praise  Thy gen'rous heart bestows I only said  What duty prompted and what love inspir'd  Indulgent heav'n has crown'd it with success  EDWARD  Thou hast done all I am indebted to thee  For more much more than I can e'er repay  Long time with shame I own hath Warwick soar'd  Above me but I will not be outdone  For ever by this proud aspiring rival  Poor as I am there yet is one way left  To pay the debt of gratitude I owe him  One great reward for such exalted virtues  Thyself Elizabeth  ELIZABETH  What means my lord  My royal master  EDWARD  Yes when next we meet  I will bestow it on him will resign  All my fond claim to happiness and thee  Tho' thy dear image ne'er can be effac'd  From Edward's breast tho' still I doat upon thee  Tho' I could hang for ever on thy beauties  Yet will I yield them to their rightful lord  Warwick has earn'd Warwick alone deserves them  ELIZABETH  Wou'd he were here to thank thee for thy goodness  Know gen'rous prince Elizabeth has long  Admir'd thy virtues and cou'd love admit  Of a divided heart the noble Edward  Wou'd share it with his friend  SCENE IV  MESSENGER EDWARD  MESSENGER  My royal liege  The rebels are dispers'd queen Marg'ret's son  Was slain in the pursuitand she  EDWARD  I hope  Secur'd  MESSENGER  Is taken pris'ner and will soon  Be here  EDWARD  But where's lord Warwick  MESSENGER  Sirthe queen  SCENE V  MARGARET Prisoner  MARGARET  Once more I am your pris'ner  EDWARD  'Twill be prudent  Henceforth to keep you so  MARGARET  You dare not  Thou think'st perhaps that I shall sue to thee  For mercy no in Marg'ret of Anjou  Thou fee'st the wife and daughter of a king  A spirit not to be subdu'd tho fall'n  Triumphant still and tho' a pris'ner free  For know I bear a mind above the reach  Of fortune or of EdwardI have lost  All I cou'd wish to live for in my child  And gain'd what most I wish'd to gain revenge  Or life or death are now indiff'rent to me  EDWARD  For thy unbounded goodness pow'r supreme  Accept our praise  ELIZABETH  kneeling  Accept our humble pray'r  MARGARET  Insulting piety the common trick  Of hypocrites and slaves when ye shall know  What Marg'ret knows ye may not be so thankful  Methinks 'tis pity Warwick is not here  To join in your devotion  ELIZABETH  Wou'd to heav'n  He were  MARGARET  That monster that perfidious slave  Who broke his faith to Marg'ret and to thee  Thy coward soul unable to defend  The treasure thou hadst stol'n cou'd meanly stoop  To court the traitor whom thou dar'st not punish  Not so the injur'd Marg'retshe repell'd  The wrongs she felt and the deceiver met  The fate he merited  EDWARD  What fateev'n now  Crown'd with immortal wreaths the hero comes  To bless his friends and punish guilt like thine  MARGARET  Proud and deluded wretches I look down  With pity on you Captive as I am  'Tis mine to judge and punish be it yours  To hear

lover perjur'd Warwick  Hath not an hour to live  EDWARD  What murth'rous hand  MARGARET  Mine tyrant mine think not I mean to hide  The noble deed it is my happiness  It is my glory thou wilt call me base  Bloodthirsty cruel savage and revengeful  But here I stand acquitted to myself  And ev'ry feeling heart that knows my wrongs  To late posterity dethroned queens  And weeping mothers shall applaud my justice  EDWARD  Justice on whom  MARGARET  Can Edward ask me who  Imprison'd Henry rob'd me of a crown  And plac'd it on a proud usurper's head  Who gave his sacred promise to a queen  And broke it who for which indignant heav'n  Chastis'd him basely murther'd my sweet boy  Bereft of honour fortune husband child  Depriv'd of ev'ry comfort what remain'd  For me but vengeance what for him but death  EDWARD  What hast thou done when where speak murthress speak  MARGARET  Press'd by surrounding multitudes and made  A slave they dragg'd me to the conqu'ror's tent  There the first horrid object I beheld  Was the pale corse of my poor bleeding child  Thereas th' insulting Warwick stood and seem'd  To triumph o'er himfrom my breast I drew  A ponyard forth and plung'd it in his heart  Th' astonish'd soldiers throng'd around him seiz'd  And brought me herenow to your pray'rs again  EDWARD  Elizabeth faints  She faints good Suffolk help there help support  Assist herlead her in  Exit Elizabeth  If it be true  As much I fear it is a thousand deaths  Were punishment too little for thy guilt  Thou shalt be tortur'd  MARGARET  Tyrant I defy thee  Thy threats appall not me prepare your tortures  Let them be sharp and cruel as thyself  All that ingenious malice can suggest  Or pow'r inflict 'twill be my comfort still  They cannot be so great as those you feel  EDWARD  Guards take the monster hence let her be chain'd  In some deep dungeon dark as her own thoughts  There let her perishhence away with her  MARGARET  Despair and horror visit theefarewell  He comes my triumph is

short moments and we part for ever  My friend  EDWARD  I am not worthy of the name  For I disgrac'd dishonour'd murther'd thee  Edward's unkindness was the cause of all  Can'st thou forgive me  WARWICK  O may Warwick's crimes  Ne'er meet forgiveness from offended heav'n  If from my soul I do not pardon love  And honour thee  EDWARD  Away let me support him  'Tis the last office I shall e'er
