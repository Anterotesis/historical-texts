 HYMNS FOUNDED ON VARIOUS TEXTS IN THE  HOLY SCRIPTURES  By the late Reverend  PHILIP DODDRIDGE  D D  Published from the AUTHOR's Manuscript By JOB ORTON  I esteem  Nepos  for his Faith and Diligence his Comments on Scripture and many Hymns with which the Brethren are delighted  Euseb Eccl Hist L C  SALOP  Printed by J EDDOWES and J COTTON And Sold by J WAUGH and W FENNER at the  Turk's Head  in  Lombard Street  and J BUCKLAND at the  Buck  in  Paternoster Row  LONDON MDCCLV  THE PREFACE  THE Author of the following  HYMNS  well known to the World by many excellent and useful Writings was much sollicited by his Friends to print them in his Lifetime from a Hope they might be serviceable to the Interest of Religion by assisting the Devotion of Christians in their social and secret Worship and had GOD continued his Life till his  FAMILYEXPOSITOR on the Epistles  had been published it is probable he would have complied with their Request But this and many other pious and benevolent Purposes were broken off by his muchlamented  th During the last Hour I spent  with him a few Weeks before that mournful Event he honoured me with some particular Directions about transcribing and publishing them I have at length thro' the good Hand of my GOD upon me finished them and present them to the World with a chearful Hope that they will promote and diffuse a Spirit of Devotion and together with other Assistances human and divine prepare many to join with the devout Author in the nobler and everlasting Anthems of Heaven  These Hymns being composed to be sung after the Author had been preaching on the Texts prefixed to them it was his Design that they should bring over again the leading Thoughts in the Sermon and naturally express and warmly enforce those devout Sentiments which he hoped were then rising in the Minds of his Hearers and help to fix them on the Memory and Heart Accordingly the attentive Reader will observe that most of them illustrate such Sentiments as a skillful Preacker would principally insist  upon when discoursing from the Texts on which they are founded There is a great Variety in the Form of them Some are devout Paraphrases on the Texts others expressive of lively Acts of Devotion Faith and Trust in GOD Love to  Christ  Desire of divine Influences and good Resolutions of cultivating the Temper and practising the Duties recommended Others proclaim an humble Joy and Triumph in the gracious Promises and Encouragements of Scripture particularly in the Discovery and Prospect of eternal Life The Nature of the Subjects will easily account for the Difference of Composure why some are more plain and artless others more lively sublime and full of poetick Fire If any of them should at first Reading appear flat or obscure it may well be supposed they would affect the Mind in a stronger Manner when used in a religious Assembly after Sermons upon the Texts in which the Context hath been considered if that were necessary parallel Places compared  the Design of the inspired Writer judiciously opened and the Beauty Propriety and Emphasis of the several Clauses of the Text illustrated They therefore who use them in their devout Retirements should first read and consider the Texts and Contexts and if they would consult some  Expositor  upon them particularly the Author's on the Subjects taken from the New Testament they will see a Spirit and Elegance in these Composures which may otherwise be overlooked and be more likely to reap real and lasting Advantage by them  In this Collection there are many Hymns formed upon Passages in the Old Testament particularly in the Prophets directly relating to the Case of the  Israelites  or some particular good Man among them which the Author hath accommodated to the Circumstances of Christians where he thought there was a just and natural Resemblance and he apprehended that the Practice of the inspired Writers of the New Testament warranted such Accommodations  Compare  Hebrews  xiii and  Family Expositor  in Loc note  e  There are also some good Remarks on this Subject in  Dr Watts's Holiness of Times Places c Disc  v especially  Prop      He experienced this to be a very acceptable and useful Method of preaching on the Old Testament and accordingly recommended it to his Pupils as what would afford them an Opportunity of explaining the Design of the Prophecies displaying the Wisdom Faithfulness and Grace of GOD and suggesting many striking and important Instructions This Method would at the same Time occasion an agreeable Variety in their Discourses prevent their confining themselves to general or commonplace Subjects or in Order to avoid a frequent Repetition of wellknown Arguments running into dry and abstruse Speculations which the Capacities of the Generality of their Hearers could not comprehend nor their Hearts relish and feel A Fashion in Preaching too prevalent and considering its apparent Unprofitableness much to be lamented  Those young Ministers who are desirous of entring into the Spirit and Copiousness of Scripture may find this Work greatly useful to them by directing them to many very suitable Texts and to some natural Thoughts and useful Reflections to be insisted upon in discoursing from them  There are several Hymns in this Collection suited to special and extraordinary Occasions for which there was not before a sufficient Provision such as for opening a new Place of Worship the Vacancy and Settlement of Churches the Ordination of Ministers their Removal from our World  c  especially for Days of Fasting and Humiliation on Account of actual or apprehended Calamities the Want of which during the late Rebellion and War was much regretted by many Ministers and private Christians  In these Composures I hope few low or trivial Expressions will be found Nothing appears unsuitable to the Gravity and Dignity of a worshipping Assembly  Nothing likely to darken or damp the Devotion of the humble Christian or excite Passions merely sensual There is nothing that savours of a Party Spirit or carries an Appearance of designing to confine their Use to any of the Sects into which Christians are unhappily divided The Materials are divine and the Author's Soul was never more enlarged than when he was promoting a Spirit of Piety and Candor in their just Connection  I chose to place these Hymns in the Order in which the several Texts lie in the Bible as that prevents the Necessity of another Index and there appeared no particular Reason for disposing them in any different Order In a few Places where Words occur not sufficiently intelligible to common Readers I have added some more plain and familiar ones in the Margin that they may be read and sung with Understanding preferring this Method to that of some Authors who have collected and explained them in a particular Index  As these Hymns were composed during a Series of many Years amidst an uncommon Variety and daily Succession of most important Labours by a Man who had no Ear for Musick and as they want his retouching Hand the Reader will be candid to what Inaccuracies he may discover particularly the Repetition of the same Thoughts and Phrases which in a few Instances will be found And indeed some of them could scarcely be avoided on Subjects so nearly resembling without the Exclusion of the most suitable and affecting Sentiments or Aspirations for which the Introduction of a new or more poetick Thought and Phrase would not have been an Equivalent There may perhaps be some Improprieties owing to my not being able to read the Author's Manuscript in particular Places and being obliged without a poetick Genius to supply those Deficiences whereby the Beauty of the Stanza may be greatly defaced tho' the Sense is preserved  These Hymns being originally designed for the Use of a Congregation of plain unlearned  Christians it cannot be expected they should entertain such who may peruse them merely for the Sake of the Poetry Yet I think many of them will stand the Test of a critical Examination and appear at least equal to other Compositions of the like Kind and I am perswaded they will all be delightful and beneficial to those who desire to have their Devotions enlivened their Souls filled with divine Love and who are ambitious to live up to the Rules of the Gospel and that they will thro' the Influences of the Holy Ghost spread a Spirit of fervent Piety in such Congregations where they may be introduced  I have nothing to add but my earnest Wishes and Prayers that they may be subservient to the Glory of GOD the more delightful Celebration of divine Ordinances and the Edification of my FellowChristians  Amen  JOB ORTON  SALOP  Jan    A TABLE TO FIND OUT ANY HYMN BY THE

thou wilt dwell  With  Adam's  worthless Race    O lead me to that happy Path  Where I my GOD may meet  Tho' Hosts of Foes begird it round  Tho' Briars wound my Feet    Chear'd with thy Converse I can trace  The Desart with Delight  Thro' all the Gloom one Smile of thine  Can dissipate the Night    Nor shall I thro' eternal Days  A restless Pilgrim roam  Thy Hand that now directs my Course  Shall soon convey me home    I ask not  Enoch's  rapt'rous Flight  To Realms of heav'nly Day  Nor seek  Elijah's  fiery Steeds  To bear this Flesh away    Joyful my Spirit will consent  To drop its mortal

bury in promiscuous Heaps  Rebels and Saints thy chief Delight    For these thy Children spare the Land  Avert the Thunders big with Death  Nor let the Seeds of latent  hidden secret  Fire  Be kindled by thy flaming Breath    On be not angry mighty GOD  While Dust and Ashes seek thy Face  But gently bending from thy Throne  Renew and still increase the Grace    JESUS the Intercessor hear  And for his Sake thy Grace impart  Which while it stops the fiery Stream  Dissolves the most obdurate Heart    Sodom  shall change to  Zion  then  And heavenly Dews be scatter'd round  That Plants of Paradise

Cattle moan  Prone  Stretched out on the Ground  o'er th' untasted Food they lye  Groan out their Agonies and dye    What have these harmless Creatures done  To draw this sore Chastisement down  'Tis human Guilt for Vengeance calls  And heavy on the Herds it falls    From them to us the Stroke might pass  And mow down Thousands of our Race  Till Desolation reign'd around  Our Cities void untill'd

rising round  With Sorrow and with Fear    Yet when its Waves most fiercely beat  And spread Destruction wide  Thy Spirit can a Standard raise  To stem  restrain  the roaring Tide    May thy triumphant Arm awake  Thy sacred Cause to plead  And let the Multitude confess  That thou art GOD indeed    Their Hearts shall in a Moment turn  Like Water by thy Hand  One Word shall bow their stubborn Necks  To own thy high command    Our feeble Souls at least support  And there thy Power display  Then Multitudes shall strive in vain  To draw us from thy Way  VIII  CHRIST'S  Intercession typified by  AARON'S  Breastplate  Exodus  xxviii    NOW let our chearful Eyes survey  Our great HighPriest above  And celebrate his constant Care  And sympathetic Love    Tho' rais'd to a superior Throne  Where Angels bow around  And high o'er all the shining Train  With matchless Honours crown'd    The Names of all his Saints he bears  Deep graven on his Heart  Nor shall the meanest Christian say  That he hath lost his Part    Those Characters shall fair abide  Our everlasting Trust  When Gems and Monuments and Crowns  Are moulder'd down to Dust    So Gracious Saviour on my Breast  May thy dear Name be worn  A sacred Ornament and Guard  To endless Ages borne  IX Who is on the Lord's Side  Exodus  xxxii    WHAT Bosom mov'd with pious Zeal  Does for its GOD'S Dishonour feel  What Heart

to move    Around thy Standard Lord we press  Thine injur'd Honour to redress  And with determin'd Voice demand  The Signal of thy conqu'ring Hand    Thou shalt these sacred Weapons bless  And lead thro' War to endless Peace  Not Death itself our Souls shall dread  For thine own Arm shall raise the Dead  X GOD'S Presence desireable  Exodus  xxxiii    IMMENSE eternal GOD  How marvellous thy Name  Thy Presence all abroad  Pervades  penetrates thro' or fills  all Nature's Frame  Heav'n Earth and Air  And the dark Cell  Where Devils dwell  In long Despair    Yet thou hast chosen Ways  To make thy Presence known  To Fav'rites of thy Grace  To upright Souls alone  This Glory LORD  My Soul would see  This Grace to me  My GOD afford    If thou thy Lustre vail  The Charms of Nature fade  All wither'd weak and pale  They bow their languid Head  My Father shine  For thou canst give  The Dead to live  By Beams divine    Ev'n  Eden's  blissful Lands  Would in thine Absence mourn  But thou wild  Afric's  AFRICA a Part of the Earth remarkable for sandy barren Desarts  Sands  To Paradise canst turn  If GOD be there  The Gloom is bright  But Noon is Night  Till thou appear    Come for my Spirit glows  With infinite Desire  Strong Love impatient grows  And sets my Heart on Fire  My Father come  That Presence give  On which I live  Or call me home  XI  MOSES'S  View of the divine Glory  Exod  xxxiii    WITH humble Pleasure Lord we trace  The ancient Records of thy Grace  And our own Consolation draw  From what thy Servant  Moses  saw    May we behold thy Glory shine  With gentle Beams of Love divine  And hear thy secret Voice proclaim  The various Wonders of thy Name    If feeble Nature faint t' endure  A Voice so sweet a Ray so pure  Its Dissolution would delight  While Death would wear a Form so bright    Death shall unvail that World above  Where the dear Children of thy Love  Attemper'd  fitted and enabled to bear  all to heavenly Day  Bear and reflect th' immediate Ray  XII The Proclamation of GOD'S Name to  Moses    or  divine Mercy and Justice  Exod  xxxiv    ATTEND my Soul the Voice divine  And mark what beaming Glories shine  Around thy condescending GOD  To us to us he still proclaims  His awful his endearing Names  Attend and sound them all abroad    "JEHOVAH I the sov'reign Lord  "The mighty GOD by Heav'n ador'd  "Down to the Earth my Footsteps bend  "My Heart the tend'rest Pity knows  "Goodness fullstreaming overflows  "And Grace and Truth shall never End    "My Patience long can Crimes endure  "My pard'ning Love is ever

its Branches spread and fill  The Borders of his sacred Hill    His Eye has mark'd the chosen Ground  His mighty Hand has fenc'd it round  His Servants by his Order wait  To watch and aid its tender State    But when the Vintage he demands  For all the Labour of their Hands  What Clusters does his Vine produce  The Grapes are wild and sour the Juice    Well might he tear its Fence away  And leave

Prophets have been sent  With Words of Terror and of Love  But nor the Vengeance nor the Grace  Ten thousand stubborn Hearts will move    Our Eyes are blind and deaf our Ears  Our Hearts are hard'ned

scatter'd Force unite again  Again shall all that Force be broke  When GOD with us shall deal the Stroke    Now he records our humble Tears  With ardent Vows for future Years  And destines for approaching Days  Victorious Shouts and Songs of Praise    Emanuel's  Land shall safe remain  Blest with its Saviour's gentle Reign  Till ev'ry hostile Rumour cease  In the fair Realms of perfect Peace  LXXXV  CHRIST  the Steward of GOD'S Family  Isaiah  xxii compared with  Revel  iii    WITH what Delight I raise mine Eyes  And view the Courts where  Jesus  dwells  Jesus  who reigns beyond the

Victory over  Satan  by the Blood of the Lamb and the Word of the Testimony of his Servants  Rev  xii    SEE the old Dragon from his Throne  Sink with enormous Ruin down  Banish'd from Heav'n and doom'd to dwell  Deep in the fiery Gloom of Hell    Ye Heav'ns with all your Hosts rejoice  Ye Saints in Consort lend your Voice  Approach your Lord's victorious Seat  And tread the Foe beneath your Feet    But whence a Conquest so divine  Gain'd by such feeble Hands as mine  Or whence can sinful Mortals boast  O'er  Satan  and his rebel Host    'Twas from thy Blood Thou slaughter'd Lamb  That all our Palms and Triumphs came  Thy Cross thy Spear inflicts the Stroke  By which the Monster's Head is broke    Thy faithful Word our Hope maintains  Thro' all our Combate and our Pains  The Accents of thy heav'nly Breath  Thy Soldiers bear thro' Wounds and Death    Triumphant Lamb in Worlds unknown  With Transport round thy radiant Throne  Thy happy Legions all compleat  Shall lay their Laurels at thy Feet  CCCLVII The Song of  Moses  and the Lamb  Rev  xv    ISRAEL  thy Tribute bring  To GOD'S victorious Name  The Song of  Moses  sing  Of  Moses  and the Lamb  Improve his Lays  Songs of Praise    The Theme exceeds  And nobler Deeds  Demand our Praise    The Prince of Hell arose  With impious Rage and Pride  And 'midst our num'rous Foes  Our feeble Pow'r defy'd  "I will o'ertake  "And I destroy  "My Hand with Joy  "Shall force thee back"    Thy Hand Almighty LORD  Thy trembling  Israel  saves  Thine unresisted Word  Divides the threatning Waves  Thy Hosts pass o'er  The Foe o'erthrown  Sinks like a Stone  To rise no more    Our Triumphs we prepare  And chearful Anthems raise  Jehovah's  Arm made bare  Demands immortal Praise  And while we sing  Ye Shores proclaim  His wondrous Name  Ye Desarts ring    Thro' all the Wilderness  Thy Presence LORD shall lead  And bring us to the Place  Thy sov'reign Love decreed  Those blissful Plains  Where all around  Hosannas  sound  And Transport reigns  CCCLVIII The Conquest of Death and Grief by Views of the heavenly State  Rev  xxi    LIFT up ye Saints your weeping Eyes  Suspend your Sorrows and your Sighs  Turn all your Groans to joyful Songs  Which  Jesus  dictates to your Tongues    Thus saith the Saviour from his Throne  "Behold all former Things are gone  "Past like an anxious Dream away  "Chas'd by the golden Beams of Day    "See in celestial Pomp array'd  "A newcreated World display'd  "Mark with what Light its Prospects shine  "How grand how various how divine    "There mine own gentle Hand shall dry  "Each Tear from each o'erflowing Eye  "And open wide my friendly Breast  "To lull the weary Soul to Rest    "No more shall Grief assail your Heart  "No boding Fear no piercing Smart  "For ever there my People dwell  "Beyond the Range of Death and Hell"    Vain King of Terrors boast no more  Thine ancient wideextended Pow'r  Each Saint in Life with  Christ  his Head  Shall reign when thou thyself art dead  CCCLIX  CHRIST  the Root and Offspring of  David  and the MorningStar  Rev  xxii    ALLHAIL mysterious King  Hail  David's  ancient Root  Thou righteous Branch which thence didst spring  To give the Nations Fruit    Our weary Souls shall rest  Beneath thy grateful Shade  Our thirsting Lips Salvation taste  Our fainting Hearts are glad    Fair MorningStar arise  With living Glories bright  And pour on these awak'ning Eyes  A Flood of sacred Light    The horrid Gloom is fled  Pierc'd by thy beauteous Ray  Shine and our wand'ring Footsteps lead  To everlasting Day  CCCLX  CHRIST'S  Invitations ecchoed back  c Rev  xxii    HOW free the Fountain flows  Of endless Life and Joy  That Spring which no Confinement knows  Whose Waters never cloy    How sweet the Accents sound  From the Redeemer's Tongue  "Assemble all ye Nations round  "In one obedient Throng    "The Spirit bears the Call  "To all the distant Lands  "The Church the Bride reflects it back  "While  Jesus  waiting stands    "Ho ev'ry thirsty Soul  "Approach the sacred Spring  "Drink and your fainting Spirits chear  "Renew the Draught and sing    "Let all that will approach  "The Water freely take  "Free

Christian rejoicing in the Views of Death and Judgment  Rev  xxii    "BEHOLD I come the Saviour cries  "On Wings of Love I fly"  So come Dear Lord my Soul replies  And bring Salvation nigh    Come loose these Bonds of Flesh and Sin  Come end my Pains and Cares  Bear me to thy serene Abode  Beyond the Clouds and Stars    I greet the Messengers of Death  By which Thou call'st me Home  But doubly greet that joyful Hour  When Thou thyself shalt come    Come plead thy Father's injur'd Cause  And make thy Glory shine  Come rouse thy Servants mould'ring Dust  And their whole Frame refine    O come

thy drowsy Eyes  And burst the pond'rous Chain that loads  Thine active Faculties    GOD'S guardian Shield was round me spread  In my defenceless Sleep  Let him have all my waking Hours  Who doth my Slumbers keep    The Work of each immortal Soul  Attentive Care demands  Think then what painful Labours wait  The faithful Pastor's Hands    My Moments fly with winged Pace  And swift my Hours are hurl'd  And Death with rapid March comes on  T' unveil th' eternal World    I for this Hour must give Account  Before GOD'S awful Throne  Let not this Hour neglected pass  As Thousands more have done    Pardon O GOD my former Sloth  And arm my Soul with Grace  As rising now I seal my Vows  To prosecute thy Ways    Bright Sun of Righteousness arise  Thy radiant Beams display  And guide my dark bewilder'd Soul  To everlasting Day  CCCLXIII An Evening HYMN to be used when composing oneself to sleep  I  INTERVAL of grateful Shade  Welcome to my weary Head  Welcome Slumbers to mine Eyes  Tir'd with glaring Vanities  My great Master still allows  Needful Periods of Repose  By my heav'nly Father blest  Thus I give my Pow'rs to Rest  Heav'nly Father gracious Name  Night and Day his Love the same  Far be each suspicious Thought  Ev'ry anxious Care forgot  Thou mine everbounteous GOD  Crown'st my Days with various Good  Thy kind Eye that cannot sleep  These defenceless Hours shall keep  Blest Vicissitude to me  Day and Night I'm still with Thee  II  What tho' downy Slumbers flee  Strangers to my Couch and me  Sleepless well I know to rest  Lodg'd within my Father's Breast  While the Empress of the Night  Scatters mild her Silver Light  While the vivid Planets stray  Various thro' their mystick Way  While the Stars unnumber'd roll  Round the everconstant Pole  Far above these spangled Skies  All my Soul to GOD shall rise  'Midst the Silence of the Night  Mingling with those Angels bright  Whose harmonious Voices raise  Ceaseless Love and ceaseless Praise  Thro' the Throng his gentle Ear  Shall my tuneless Accents hear  From on high doth he impart  Secret Comfort to my Heart  He in these serenest Hours  Guides my intellectual Pow'rs  And his Spirit doth diffuse  Sweeter far than Midnight Dews  Lifting all my Thoughts above  On the Wings of Faith and Love  Blest Alternative to me  Thus to sleep or wake with Thee  III  What if Death my Sleep invade  Should I be of Death afraid  Whilst encircled by thine Arm  Death may strike but cannot harm  What if Beams of op'ning Day  Shine around my breathless Clay  Brighter Visions from on high  Shall regale my mental Eye  Tender Friends awhile may mourn  Me from their Embraces torn  Dearer better Friends I have  In the Realms beyond the Grave  See the guardian Angels nigh  Wait to waft my Soul on high  See the golden Gates display'd  See the Crown to grace my Head  See a Flood of sacred Light  Which no more shall yield to Night  Transitory World farewell  Jesus  calls with him to dwell  With thy heav'nly Presence blest  Death is Life and Labour Rest  Welcome Sleep or Death to me  Still secure for still with Thee  CCCLXIV On Recovery from Sickness during which much of the divine Favour had been experienced    MY GOD thy Service well demands  The Remnant of my Days  Why was this fleeting Breath renew'd  But to renew thy Praise    Thine Arms of everlasting Love  Did this weak Frame sustain  When Life was hov'ring o'er the Grave  And Nature sunk with Pain    Thou when the Pains of Death were felt  Didst chase the Fears of Hell  And teach my pale and quiv'ring Lips  Thy matchless Grace to tell    Calmly I bow'd my fainting Head  On thy dear faithful Breast  Pleas'd to obey my Father's Call  To his eternal Rest    Into thy Hands my Saviour GOD  Did I my Soul resign  In firm Dependence on that Truth  Which made Salvation mine    Back from the Borders of the Grave  At thy Command I come  Nor would I urge a speedier Flight  To my celestial Home    Where Thou determin'st mine Abode  There would I chuse to be  For in thy Presence Death is Life  And Earth is Heav'n with Thee  CCCLXV The last Words of  David  Samuel xxiii  agreeable to the ingenious metrical Version of the learned  Dr Richard Grey      THUS hath the Son of  Jesse  said  When  Israel's  GOD had rais'd his Head  To high Imperial Sway  Struck with his last poetick Fire  Zion's  sweet Psalmist tun'd his Lyre  To this harmonious Lay    Thus dictates  Israel's  sacred Rock  Thus hath the GOD of  Jacob  spoke  By my responsive Tongue  Behold the JUST ONE over Men  Commencing his religious Reign  Great Subject of my Song    So gently shines with genial Ray  Th' unclouded Lamp of rising Day  And cheers the tender Flow'rs  When Midnight's soft diffusive Rain  Hath bless'd the Gardens and the Plain  With kind refreshing Show'rs    Shall not my House this Honour boast  My Soul th' eternal Cov'nant trust  Wellorder'd still and sure  There all my Hopes and Wishes meet  In Death I call its Blessings sweet  And feel its Bond secure    The Sons of  Belial  shall not spring  Who spurn at Heav'n's appointed King  And scorn his high Command  Tho' wide the Briars infest the Ground  And the sharppointed Thorns around  Defy a tender Hand    A dreadful Warriour shall appear  With Iron Arms and massy Spear  And tear them from their Place  Touch'd with the Lightning of his Ire  At once they kindle into Fire  And vanish in the Blaze  CCCLXVI A MILITARY ODE PSALM CXLIX  Probably composed by  David  to be sung when his Army was marching out to War against the Remnant of the devoted Nations of  Canaan  and first went up in solemn Procession to the House of  GOD  at  Jerusalem  there as it were to consecrate the Arms which he put into their Hands  The Beds  referred to  ver  were probably the Couches on which they lay at the Banquet attending their Sacrifices which gives a noble Sense to a Passage on any other Interpretation hardly intelligible    O Praise ye the LORD prepare a new Song  And let all his Saints in full Consort join  Ye Tribes all assemble the Feast to prolong  In solemn Procession with Musick divine    O  Israel  in him that made thee rejoice  Let all  Zion's  Sons exult in their King  While to martial Dances you join a glad Voice  Your lutes harps and timbrels in harmony bring    The LORD in his Saints still finds his Delight  Salvation from him the Meek shall adorn  They well may be joyful sustain'd by his Might  And crown'd by his favour may lift up their horn    Let Carpets be spread and Banquets prepar'd  Those Altars around whence Incense ascends  Whilst Anthems of Glory thro'  Salem  are heard  And GOD whom we worship indulgent attends    Then as your Hearts bound with Musick Wine  Inspir'd by the GOD who reigns in the Place  Unsheath all your Weapons and bright let them shine  And brandish your Faulchions while chaunting his Praise    Then march to the Field the Heathen defy  And scatter his Wrath on Nations around  Like angels of vengeance your swords lift on high  And boast that  Jehovah  commissions the wound    Their Gen'rals subdu'd your triumphs shall grace  And loaded with Chains their Kings shall be brought  On the Necks shall ye trample of  Canaan's  proud Race  And all their last remnant for slaughter be sought    No Rage of your own such Rigour demands  A Sentence divine your Arms must fulfill  Of old he this vengeance consign'd to your hands  And in sacred Volumes recorded his Will    This Honour ye Saints appointed for you  Allgrateful receive and faithful obey  And while his dread Pleasure resistless ye do  Still make his high Praises the Song of the Day  CCCLXVII For the ThanksgivingDay for the Peace  April      NOW let our Songs address the GOD of Peace  Who bids the Tumult of the Battle cease  The pointed Spears to pruning Hooks he bends  And the broad Faulchion in the Plowshare ends  His pow'rful Word unites contending Nations  In kind Embrace and friendly Salutations    Britain  adore the Guardian of thy State  Who high on his celestial Throne elate  Still watchful o'er thy Safety and Repose  Frown'd on the Counsels of thy haughtiest Foes  Thy Coasts secur'd from ev'ry dire Invasion  Of Fire and Sword and spreading Desolation    When rebel bands with desp'rate madness join'd  He wafted o'er Deliv'rance with his Wind  Drove back the Tide that delug'd half our Land  And curb'd their Fury with his mightier Hand  Till dreadful Slaughter and the last Confusion  Taught those audacious Sinners their Delusion    He gave our Fleets to triumph o'er the Main  And scatter Terror 'cross wide Ocean's Plain  Opposing Leaders trembled at the Sight  Nor found their Safety in th' attempted Flight  Taught by their Bonds how vainly they pretended  Those to distress whom  Israel's  GOD defended    Fierce Storms were summon'd up in  Britain's  aid  And meagre Famine hostile Lands o'erspread  By Suff'rings bow'd their Conquests they release  Nor scorn the Overtures of equal Peace  Contending Pow'rs congratulate the Blessing  Joint Hymns of Gratitude to Heav'n addressing    While we beneath our Vines and FigTrees sit  Or thus within thy sacred Temple meet  Accept Great GOD the Tribute of our Song  And all the Mercies of this Day prolong  Then spread thy peaceful Word thro' ev'ry Nation  That all the Earth may hail thy great Salvation  CCCLXVIII An Hymn for a FastDay in Time of War    GREAT GOD of Heav'n and Nature rise  And hear our loud united Cries  See  Britain  bow before thy Face  Thro' all her Coasts and seek thy Grace    No Arm of Flesh we make our Trust  Nor Sword nor Horse nor Ships we boast  Thine is the Land and thine the Main  And human Force and Skill is vain    Our Guilt might draw thy Vengeance down  On ev'ry Shore on ev'ry Town  But view us LORD with pitying Eye  And lay thy lifted Thunder by    Forgive the Follies of our Times  And purge our Land from all its Crimes  Reform'd and deck'd with Grace divine  Let Princes Priests and People shine    O may no GODprovoking Sin  Thro' all our Camps and Navies reign  No foul Reproach to drive from thence  Our surest Glory and Defence    So shall our GOD delight to bless  And crown our Arms with wide Success  Our Foes shall dread JEHOVAH'S Sword  And conqu'ring  Britain  shout the LORD  CCCLXIX Thanksgiving for National Deliverance and Improvement of it    SALVATION doth to GOD belong  His Pow'r and Grace shall be our Song  His Hand hath dealt a secret Blow  And Terror strikes the haughty Foe    Praise to the LORD who bows his Ear  Propitious to his People's Pray'r  And tho' Deliv'rance long delay  Answers in his wellchosen Day    O may thy Grace our Land engage  Rescu'd from fierce tyrannic Rage  The Tribute of its Love to bring  To Thee our Saviour and our King    Our Temples guarded from the Flame  Shall eccho thy triumphant Name  And ev'ry peaceful private Home  To Thee a Temple shall become    Still be it our supreme Delight  To walk as in thy honour'd Sight  Still in thy Precepts and thy Fear  To Life's last Hour to persevere  CCCLXX A Church seeking Direction from God in the Choice of a Pastor    SHEPHERD of  Israel  bend thine Ear  Thy Servants Groans indulgent hear  Perplex'd distress'd to Thee we cry  And seek the Guidance of thine Eye    Thy comprehensive View surveys  Our wand'ring Paths our trackless Ways  Send forth O LORD thy Truth and Light  To guide our doubtful Footsteps right    With longing Eyes behold we wait  In suppliant Crouds at Mercy's Gate  Our drooping Hearts O GOD sustain  Shall  Israel  seek thy Face in vain    O LORD in Ways of Peace return  Nor let thy Flock neglected mourn  May our blest Eyes a Shepherd see  Dear to our Souls and dear to Thee    Fed by his Care our Tongues shall raise  A chearful Tribute to thy Praise  Our Children learn
