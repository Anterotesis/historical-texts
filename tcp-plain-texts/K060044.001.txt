of life through which we are to scramble of course the knowledge of that world is the best science we can learn but open as it is to the view of every man spread  as the volume is before us it is not every one that can read and fewer there are that as they read can understand  Novels have been introduced to delineate and depict this scene and characters have been drawn to shew the manners and disposition of the people but they have in general been so ill penned as to destroy the very end they aimed at The characters they have exhibited have been so deformed as to bear no resemblance to nature the traits of life have been so exaggerated and the truth of things so masked as to deceive the reader instead of  informing him and the dullnesss and insipidity of modern novels have been such as to disgust and tire him before he has got half way through them There are but few men capable of painting life as it is those only who have travelled on for a number of years through the various scenes of it and made observations as they passed and even these without the happy art of drawing characters to the life making a proper selection of them and bringing them in properly to their aid can neither hope to improve or to entertain but a novel fraught with observation full of incident and replete with worldly knowledge is the most  instructive book a young mind can read for thus learning wisdom from the rashness and folly of others he will be able to see his way before him avoid the snares and calamities too often attendant upon life and perhaps make his way to the end of it with ease and comfort  It is on this principle and with the prospect of being use to mankind that I have attempted to lay before the world the adventures of a young man who in the course of a very few years saw as much of the world as most others have done in double his time I was very intimate with him and of course am  as well able to recite his adventures as he could have done himself he is now no more and having lelf no family I have no ear to wound The occurrences he met with in life when related by him to me were highly entertaining and I will endeavour to transmit them so to my readers  My friend Will Ramble was the son and only child of a country gentleman who was great part of his life a Colonel of militia of a county in the south of England he bred up his son to a military life instilled into him principles of high honour and gave him a finished  education he was naturally a brave man of a fine soldierlike figure and a polished gentleman but never having been during his father's life much in the world except in the military line in which he was bred and it being time of peace his ideas were in a great measure consined to the manners and customs of the district in which he lived His father however had brought him on by purchase in the army and he was a Lieutenant Colonel of foot at the age of twentyeight when the old gentleman died on looking into his father's effects he found himself possessed of a good familymansion in the west an estate of about seven  hundred pounds a year and about three thousand pounds in securities Having no tye to fix him to any particular spot and fortunately having found a tenant for his house and land he determined to spend some part of his money in the ramble of a few years in search of that information he found himself deficient in that is to acquire a knowledge of men and manners from the objects as they pass before him as much as to say to travel first through his own country and next to see what was doing in the neighbouring ones perhaps says he in this excursion I may pick up a wife with a fortune equal to my  own that may enable me to retire to my native place and live with as much credit as did my father before me in which case I will turn my sword into a ploughshare if not and a war should break out I will pursue the line of my profession and devote my life to the service of my country  These were my friend Will's principles and with these he sat out not for the metropolis the centre to which all the young and the giddy fly but proceeded to the extent of his line at first beginning at the very North of the Highlands and determining to retreat southward  The Colonel took with him an  honest faithful servant and Irishman that had been recommended to him by a BrigadierGeneral who had served several campaigns in India and who having no further occasion for him urged my friend to take him as a man who had travelled through most countries had a great deal of shrewd cunning a courage and steadiness equal to a bulldog and a fidelity not to be corrupted and scarcely to be equalled He had lost an eye in an engagement but was not on that account the more unsightly for a soldier's service He was truly disciplined and as such obedient to command and though somewhat coarse in his language  had a certain honesty about him that made him a valuable acquisition  His name was Flint and his rank a Corporal When his master consigned him to my friend he said  Flint you have had a hard service with  me  and it is time you should have a furlough I am almost worn out in arms you are a young man for he was not more than forty years of age and that quiet retreat that I may coyet will ill suit your busy bustling spirit I recommend you therefore  o my friend Ramble he is a brothersoldier if another war should  break out with him you may see a little more of service be faithful to him as you have been to me and he will love you as much as I do  "Flint" returned the Corporal  and plaise your honor will sarve your friend as he would sarve yourself Ill as dame Fortune has treated me I shall not be unwilling to enlist again under her banners and give our enemies another drubbing and if I find in Squire Ramble as good a commander as your honor I trust he will find me as good a soldier  CHAP II  I SHALL not give my readers a detail of the various stages our hero passed nor a descriptive account of the several places at which he stopped I mean neither to be a journalist nor a travelwriter but shall relate only the principal adventures of his life and the extraordinary characters he met with Upon this plan I shall only say that  getting letters of recommendation into the North as a gentleman upon his travels he made the best of his way into the Highlands and was well received at the house of Mr Campbell a Laird of a Clan in that part of the world This gentleman's family consisted of his wife and daughter and a young lady a niece of Mrs Campbell's the daughter of Mr Raspe a Liverpool merchant a little hotheaded impetuous man who had a brother settled in London and who having been knighted increased the jealousy of this old man beyond conception he had amassed a large fortune in the SlaveTrade and having an only child this  Miss Raspe his foolish plan was to marry her if possible to a Lord and thus outdo his brother in point of ideal consequence to this end he deprived himself almost of the necessaries of life to add to his capital and lest his daughter a fine girl should pick up a husband of her own and thus baffle his expectations he placed her from the age of thirteen under the care of his sister married to this Mr Campbell determining to keep her there as it were out of the world till she was of a marriageable age In the house of Mr Campbell the Colonel was very well received and on account of Miss Raspe for whom he conceived a  liking and whose fortune led further to an attachment he was induced to make a longer stay with the family than he at first intended  It is not to be wondered at that Miss Raspe though immured in the cold regions of the North should at her time of life then just sixteen feel a glow in her breast at the many fine sentiments Cold Ramble was capable of uttering and become enamoured with what she heard from so handsome a man He addressed her with all the warmth of a lover and all the animation of a soldier and though his opportunities were but few he availed himself of them  and he being the first sashlonable man she had seen she became presently in love with him  There was nothing in the character of Miss Raspe singular or worth remarking it is sufficient to say she was a girl of spirit of fine figure had a pleasing face and was altogether an object of admiration It was necessary to conceal their liking for each other her father having acquainted his sister with his design and all they could do was to plan how they should meet each other in future Mrs Campbell was as watchful as an Argus but the Colonel found means to settle the business  through Flint who was as industrious and cautious as a spy  Scarce had he made his  entrÃ©e  at Mr Campbell's house than he was waited on by Mr Macanochy a Scotch Priest the Minister of the parish one of those officious men who are always in our way and who came now to welcome the Colonel to Fochabar that being the name of the parish  The Colonel had by means of his servant Flint just received a letter from Miss Raspe which he was kissing with fervency when Macanochy entered the room without any introduction  In gude troth Sir you seem said he if my eyne dinna deceive me to be mair in love with that lettre than ony bra lad of the Highlands I hae yet seen wi his bonnie lassie  Indeed replied the Colonel I am it is from the dearest friend I have and I am impatient to read its contents  Dinana let me interrupt you then said Macanochy dinna let me interrupt you  Here he took some snuff with his right hand from the left hand pocket of his waistcoat which was full of it and filling his nose scattering it plentifully down his bosom the Colonel took this  opportunity of opening the letter Scarce had he passed his eye over the first line but Macanochy drew up close along side of him and tapped him on the sleeve with  an ye be a freend of the Campbell faamalie youre cum in a loocky our for we are t hae a muster of the Clan in the morning  but observing the Colonel impatient to read his letter adds  dinna let me interrupt ye maun dinna let me interrupt ye  and takes another pinch but scarce had the Colonel read another line but he approaches him as before with  I am bold to say we muster mair men in Fochabar than in ony paarish in aw the  Highlands  I beg your pardon replied the Colonel with a degree of mortification  I shall be happy to hear your story and see your muster at any other time but this letter requires an immediate answer and I hope you will excuse me  In Gode's name replies Macanochy dinna let me interrupt ye gang awa read your letter and answer it  At this moment Flint entered the room as upon some business and the Colonel took that opportunity of leaving it saying to Flint as he passed don't let him follow me Flint seeing Macanochy going after his master shouldered his stick and placing himself against  the door as a centinel cried out aloud  who goes there who are you where do you come from where are you going  I must not omit here to notice that Flint though he did not wear a uniform was dressed something like a soldier he wore a kind of travelling furcap with a cockade in it a short jacket and a pair of gaters Macanochy was almost as strange a figure a man upwards of fifty of a sallow complexion and so highly characteristic of his country were his cheekbones that it was doubtful whether he had the right use of his eyes which seemed full of suspicion of snuff he appeared a monopolizer the  left hand pocket of his waistcoat as I have observed was full of it and the line from that to his nose totally covered with it he was dressed in a rusty black coat and a slouched hat Flint knew not what to make of him but was determined to obey his master's orders Macanochy finding himself repulsed drew back with surprize for though he was mean and shabby in appearance he was not wanting in national pride Indeed the ancient pride of the Clans was so great that a late Duke of Argyle whose name was Campbell and who used to treat his tenantry as the greatest vassals riding up to a gate near which sat reading a son of one of his tenants lately  returned from abroad would not deign to speak to him but pointed to the gate and made a sign to him to open it The man took no notice of this but continued reading The Duke made a second signal to the same end and finding it unattended to cried with an imperious tone of voice  Dm you fellow why dinna you open the yate dinna you kenme Open it  "Na na" retorts the other "I am a Campbell mysel" But to return to my story Macanochy finding himself repulsed by Flint started back with surpaize  An ye dinna ken Mess John Macanochy  said he  I maun tell ye freend that I am Minnister of the paarish and am to be treated with unco  respect  "A centinel" cries Flint  at an outpost knows no respect of parsons if you were  king  honey of the parish you could not pass this way without the watchword  In gude troth returns Macanochy if we are to ask questions in the name of St Andrew who and what are you  In the name of St Patrick retorts Flint a soldier and on duty not to be corrupted  Macanochy's patience now gave way he laid hold of Flint's cuff and endeavoured to pull him aside but Flint shoved him back and presenting his staff at him cryed with a vocsiferous voice  keep your distance  or I will run my bayonet through you  Macanochy finding a passage that way impracticable replyed with a little more coolness and comforting himself with a favorite pinch  though  your  profession cheild is  war mine  is  peace  if I canna pass ane way I will anither we wonna wrangle about it but stay ye there in Gode's name and discharge your duty  and went out at another door  CHAP III  THE arrival of Mr Raspe was now announced in the family hearing that a certain English nobleman had placed his son at Florence under the idea of improvement but in fact with a design to keep him there till his boyish days were over that he might make no improper attachmentMr Raspe understanding this determined to take his daughter to Florence to throw her in  the way of this young nobleman hoping to captivate him in a place where English beauties and good fortunes were rare With this view he set out for Scotland to fetch his daughter and unluckily for all the parties arrived at Campbell Hall whilst my friend Will was there  This arrival unexpected and unforeseen disconcerted the young folks exceedingly the old man alarmed at the appearance of a red coat in a place where he so little expected it and dreading as well he might that it would tend to an abortion of his scheme had scarce set his foot in the house but he attacked his sister in the following manner  So sister you have done a pretty job  for me you are a fine one to trust to how I could rely upon a  woman  I don't know I placed my daughter my only child under your care your damned care and prettily I am like to smart for it  My good brother returns she what is the matter what puts you out of temper  Matter enough retorts he waspishly have not I sunk all my hopes in that girl Have I not relied on your care and good management And pretty magagement it is I  did  sister hope by sending her to you that she would be out of all danger free from the snares that are ever laid for a good fortune and that the time would  come when I should find her an honour and a credit to me But instead of this you have admitted nay  introduced  a trumpery redcoated scoundrel to her and cannot even answer for her affections not being gone  Indeed brother you are too soon alarmed answered Mrs Campbell the Colonel has been a very short time here and it is uncertain whether he will stay fix hours  Six hours retorts he I hate these lobstering fellows I wish I had him at Bonny aboard one of my Guinea ships I would soon transport him to the West Indies They are as insidious as rattlesnakes  and like them carry their venom in their tails Six hours I would not trust her with him six minutes he would poison her in  half  the time" I am surprised says Mrs Campbell you can speak so disrespectfully of persons of condition your hasty ways bring you little comfort and much less credit the Colonel is a man of the highest honour and character and you do him a great deal of injustice  Raspe somewhat matched and somewhat modulated peevishly told his sister there was little either of character or honour that buzzed round  a pretty girl much more one with a good fortune and let the Colonel be ever so honouralbe or ever so proper a man in her opinion he would take good care to frustrate her intentions  Indeed brother said she your troubles are imaginary and if you will be filly enough to listen to every idle report that is brought you you may have troubles indeed The Colonel has no such thought I am sure and if you will as readily believe me as you do others you will find there is no foundation in any thing you have heard  This speech of Mrs Campbell's  though it produced a very different emotion in the mind of her brother did not produce a very different effect for his natural violence made itself as useful to him as it could on all occasions for when pleased he was as loud as when angry  How how retorts he with a forced laugh no  foundation  I am glad of that glad indeed it shall be may fualt then if he lays the first stone  To prevent any further altercation she left him and no sooner was she gone than he was suddenly accosted by Macanochy who came bowing  low into the room as he advanced plying his nostrils alternately with snuff from the ball of his thumb thus producing an attitude truly ridiculous  Having given my readers the figure of this man to shew them the contrast it is proper I should give them some description of Raspe He was of a low stature reduced by the fever of his fretful brain to a most abject state of proportion which the number of his years only served to heighten When he thought proper to dress himself one of nature's greatest curiosities it was not vanity but from an idea that it was necessary to preserve every thing from rust therefore an occasional rub and  covering up was his substitute for decoration He wore a scratch wig his hat was of Oliverian mould and his coat without a collar long in the waist short in the skirts was of a colour best suited to hide the defects of age and ornamented with a double row of angular buttons  Macanochy on approaching Raspe thus addressed him  As an intimate freend of the Campbell family I tak the liberty of introducing mysel to you we have been lang expecting you you are dootless enchanted with the improvement and elegance of your daughteroh she's a bonny lassie    Sir retorts Raspe with  impatience you break in upon me when my mind is too disturbed to    Patience my gude sir says Macanochy interrupting him and tapping him on the elbow is a vertue and its opposite maun be a veece It is an unco peety therefore you should be impatient when patience would answer a muckle better end and taking another darling pinch patience has made more conquests than many armiespatience has got the better of the greatest tyrants patience  Raspe sick of this long story of a virtue he had so little in himself and not being in the most agreeable mood  replyed  I suppose you mean to try my patienceI will have no experiments made on meI presume you are a parson by your preaching  You are unco rieht Sir returned Macanochy I am minnister of the gospel in this parish my name is Macanochy my father and grandfather have been minnisters of Fochabar since the year I hate mony words or I could tell ye we can trace our family as far back as when the great Huntly defeated  Raspe was the last person the minister should have fixed on to have amused with such long stories his mind was better suited even in his good humours to few words and at a time he was ready to burst with apprehensions  from the Colonel to be interrupted with such a tiresome old fellow was enough to turn his brain he once more therefore said to Macanochy  I want none of your chronology I hate history I don't like my own but if you know what brought the Colonel here say it  Sure aneugh says Macanochy I ken the Colonel and the Colonel kens me there is not a bairn in aw the Highlands that does not ken the Reverend Mr Macanochy of Fochabar strutting about and taking snuff the Colonel is a distant freend of a Laird of a neighbouring clan who had an uncle a Major in India who performed great wonders counting his family on his fingers  he had another relation on his mither's side an Admiral who signalized himsel in mony great atchievements    What of all this retorts Raspe angrily interrupting him How came he here  Why maun continued Macanochy with a determined coolness you put me oot He has a keusin married to Lord Gramont a very gude lady I could say mony fine things of her but I am a maun like yoursel of few words He has another keusin married to Sir Archibald M'Donald of Ochiltree who in the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy    I told you before said Raspe with still greater impatience I want no chronology  and hate all history but that of negroland What brought the Colonel here    The Colonel says Macanochy is a haundsome gallant fallow every saul here loves him weel maun women and bairns  Raspe not being able to bear his prolixity any longer lost his temper and stamped about the room Macanochy to make him still more angry said with a degree of contemptuous coolness  If your sheine offend you tak them off  "Every body in love with him" returns Raspe with eagerness  Every body replies Macanochy and I will tell you something that will make you very happyhe loves your daughter and your daughter loves him  Raspe could no longer contain himself and this last declaration of the passive priest maddened him he flew he kicked he stamped abut like one frantic and left Macanochy stupified with amazement  CHAP IV  RASPE was determined to take away his daughter the next morning and nothing his sister could say though she told him the Colonel was either going or gone answered any purpose he would not stay in a house so unfriendly to his  wishes indeed he had no reason to dispute his sister's veracity and when she brought him word that the Colonel had left the house he began to believe it but an illfated accident overthrew the whole and determined him to quit the place that very night It happened that Mr Raspe was lodged in the next room to Miss Campbell divided only by a partition in which there was a door of communication between the two rooms in Miss Campbell's room the young couple had occasionally met and having settled the plan of future operations the Colonel was just come there to take his leave of Miss Raspe when her father had just entered the next room in order to take off his boots his sister was with him  reasoning on the absurdity of his taking the matter up so seriously and paying them so short a visithis servant a black whom he had ever treated with great severity was employed in drawing off one of his master's boots as he fat in the chair before the door that opened into Miss Campbell's apartment and Mrs Campbell was just then assuring him the Colonel was gone imagining that really to have been the case  Gone or not gone cries he with a loud voice I will stay no longer than tomorrow  and then to his slave  Rascal why don't you pull the boot with more forcepull you dog or I will be the death of you  At that instant Miss Campbell was peeping  though the keyhole of the inner room saying Mr Raspe was in a monstrous passion and the Colonel was taking his leave of Miss Raspe and upon his knee kissing her hand with the utmost fervency when the poor black pulling the boot with more than ordinary exertion it slipped unexpectedly off and losing his equilibrium fell back violently against the door burst it open threw Miss Campbell upon her back and discovered the Colonel kissing Miss Raspe's hand  Reader if thou can'st paint to thyself the situation of all the parties if thou can'st picture in thy fancy the disappointment the mortification  of every one present if thou can'st read in the proud looks of Mrs Campbell the confusion of being caught in a lie though an innocent one if thou can'st feel for the disastrous situation of Miss Campbell who was thrown almost heels over head if thou can'st pity the discovery of the young couple's evident declaration of love if thou can'st carry in thy mind the horror of the black scrambling to get up and displaying his large white eyes and teeth grinning with a ghastly dread of the vengeance of his master if thou can'st have any conception of a wrathful old man panicstruck and rendered motionless by surprize and anger thou wilt be able to form some idea of the condition  of the parties present It was some moments before either of them could recover from their situation Raspe stuck fast in his chair the Colonel riveted on his knee Miss Raspe's hand still in his Miss Campbell sprawling on the floor Mrs Campbell fixed as a statue and the poor black trembling as for life Raspe's eye fixed upon his sister's and his sister's on his seeming to upbraid each other the Colonel and Miss with their's fixed on the ground paint this in your mind and thou wilt view the scene as it was Raspe springing from his chair flew at his daughter and seizing her by the arm broke this awful silence with a  Come Miss Mum I will not lose sight of you  again we will be off to night  To Miss Campbell he said I am much obliged to you for your  attention  to my daughter to the Colonel  I apprehend  you  have lost a recruit  to his sister sneeringly and imitating her manner of expressing herself to him  the Colonel is a man of  honour  damn his honourno such  intention  no  foundation  Hell fire and furies  and thus he left them  The Colonel though a man of spirit felt the aukwardness of his situation pitied the temper of the old man was sorry for the disturbance he had occasioned and lest any thing he might say  or any apologies he could make might only exasperate the more and render their meeting in future more difficult thought it best to be silent  Raspe now began to prepare for his immediate departure as did the Colonel for his the next morning but the arrangement c of Miss Raspe and other matters took up the whole of the evening and there was very little likelihood of their getting away before break of day Raspe however determining not to sleep another night in the house was busy in preparing for his journey  The incidents of the day entirely  discomposed the family nor could they sit down to any regular supper Mr Campbell an infirm old man had retired to his bed and Macanochy whose spirit of quietism nothing could disorder who felt himself at home in whatever house of the parish he was in had got a snack in the larder regaled himself alone with a pinch of snuff and a bottle of ale and stole away to his closet where he was accustomed to sleep when at this house This was unknown to any of the family who imagined he was gone indeed go to what house he would he always took his nightcap in his pocket This closet was a recess behind the partition of one  of the rooms just large enough to hold a bed as is the custom in Scotland and the sliding wainscot was so contrived as to close and shut it in  Mr Raspe was jarring with his sister the whole night and would every now and then break out into such fits of rage as to disturb the sleepers Mr Campbell who had scarcely had his first nap jumped out of bed during one of these noises half asleep and half awake not conceiving what it could be he slipt on his nightgown took up his candle and the noise increasing salled forth from his chamber and meeting with Flint at the head of the stairs "Good  Mr Corporal said he what  is  the matter"  O' my conscience says Flint matter enough the enemy is storming the fort and we shall be all in a blaze presently  This frightened Mr Campbell more than ever and he begged of the Corporal to conduct him down stairs Flint took the candle and marched in the van the old gentleman followed close in the rear and as he conducted him they passed through the room where Macanochy was closeted but this being in a distant part of the house the priest was not so much disturbed they no sooner however reached this room that another  violent noise was heard with a great clattering and ringing of bells  Lord Lord  cries Mr Campbell what a "racket"  By my fait replies Flint I like this glorious rattling it puts me in mind of the storming of Trincomalee when the bombs flew over our heads like hailstones    Oh it was a joyous day your honour and I never shall forget it  More noise being heard Mr Campbell begged of the Corporal to go and learn the occasion of it and send up one of his servants Being now left to himself with the candle in his hand and the noise increasing he got up to the further end of the room near the closet where Macanochy was in  bed who the noise having alarmed him drew back the sliding partition suddenly and sitting bolt upright terrified poor Mr Campbell who little imagined he was there  I must here again represent to my reader as I have before done the oddity of this scene describe to yourself a trembling old man with a lighted taper in his hand in a flannel nightgown and a white cap and his face through fear as colourless as his cap quaking as he stood imagining it was a ghost in the closet and macanochy with a snuffy face and a dirty night cap tied under his chin starting also with surprize at seeing Mr Campbell who he little  expected to see and whom between sleeping and waking he conceived likewise to be an apparition I say picture this to your imagination and you must smile at the scene these two ghastly personages gazed for a moment in silence on each other with horror  Macanochy broke it with  Minnisters of grace defend me Be ye a goblin    No says his fellow ghost I am no goblin Mr Macanochy I am Mr Campbell  If you are no goblin replies the priest how came you here in all this storm  And on Mr Camphell's telling him he did not know he stept there Macanochy continued  Sleep is out of the question it is impossible  to sleep in such a hurricane eats screaming women bawling that old chield stamping bells ringing bagpipes blowing and above aw shrugging his shoulders the troop of little black gentry that infeit this closet and wha hae fund their way over me as did the Lilliputians over Gulliver as he lay on the grass By St Andrew shaking himself the weewee deels gnaw and devour me as if I was a lost creature given up to their tormentsbut what is aw this fresh noise aboot  A servant who at that moment entered and who had not got rightly at the story reported that Colonel Ramble  had been caught with Miss Raspe and that there was the duce to pay about it these words were no sooner uttered than Macanochy gathered the blanket about him jumped out of bed and running up to the servant with surprize cried out  Catched together say you It is a muckle peety they had not my benediction first  and on being asked by Mr Campbell what good that would have done added  wonderful gude it is a ceremony that transforms veece into virture and makes that innocent which without it is held as criminal Had they sent for me I would hae set aw to rights  his oinion of Macanochy's arose  from his misunderstanding the servant who upon explaining himself and saying by being caught together he meant only to say they were seen in company together and that Mr Raspe on finding it flew into a violent passion Macanochy consoled himself with  If that be aw there is nae harm dune aws weel yet  More noise being now heard he went on  the storm is gathering again I'll to my bedSatan I defy ye  and drawing too the slider of his closet shut himself up and left Mr Campbell to make the best of his way to his chamber  We here see in the character of Macanochy the weakness and ridiculousness of those who are fond of talking themselves but who dislike it in others he wished to be thought a man of few words and yet was loquacious in the extreme we meet with such men in the world and their character is truly laughable they are so full of what they have to say themselves that they can attend to no reply and though by this they may think to render themselves agreeable they become tiresome beyond measure and there is scare a man they talk to but like the Colonel would be glad to fly from them Conscious of this the long talker will hold you by the  button lest you should escape before you have heard him out  These were my friend's remarks on the men he met with abroad So again in the character of Raspe We readily see defects abroad which we are blind to at home and are eager to condemn in others what we can reconcile to ourselves where our interest leads Raspe condemned his sister from an opinion that the introduced the Colonel to his daughter when at the very time he was conveying his daughter to Florence with a similar view  CHAP V  MR Raspe set off with his daughter at day break on his journey he purposed to take Liverpool in his way continue there a few weeks till he had adjusted his business and then proceed on his route to London where he would continue some time till he had equipped his daughter with such necessaries as would set her off to the best advantage at Florence the  Colonel did not continue at Mr Campbell's long after them he sat off the morning following but had planned it with Miss Raspe that as he should naturally be in town some weeks before her she should on her arrival make him immediately acquainted with it  On reaching London for his attachment to Miss Raspe had quite changed his plan of proceedings he put up at one of those fashionable houses called Hotels but where there was a common room of assembling at meals as at Bath He had scarce set his foot in this House but he met with an old Devonshire friend  Charles Simple This young gentleman with his sister was reduced to the necessity upon the death of their parents to live upon the patrimony of between two and three hundred pounds per year  The father was possessed of as many thousands but having lived as do the generality of fashionable men in a style superior to his income the consequence was he brought up his son and daughter with high notions of gentility dissipated his fortune and left them little or nothing to suport it Charles was a young man full of simplicity and very easily led but his sister on the contrary  was artful intriguing talkative and obstinate she had such a volubility of tongue that no rattle could equal Like Macanochy the Scotch Minister she was full of herself fond of the sound of her own voice and could suffer no reply but she had not that  sang froid  about her that he possessed she was all fire and spirit She was a few years older than her brother and made him believe she had a superior knowledge told him that if he would follow her directions that as he was a handsome fellow and had received a good education she would put him in the way of making his fortune that as their connections were in general good and London was  the centre where they would probably meet she advised making up a sum of money in the best way they could setting off for London there trying their fortune and trusting to the chapter of accidents  They had been some time with this view living in style at this hotel and had not only spent the money they had brought with them but had run a debt that greatly embarrassed them This was their situation when my friend Will Ramble met with them  God bless my soul Charles said he I should as soon have expected to have seen the equestrian state at  CharingCross travelling through Taunton as to have met with you in London so stationary did I think you What in the name of fortune brought you here  My romantic sister replyed heyou may well compare me to that statue at CharingCross I am merely a figure and she moves me where she pleases I wish I had as little feeling and sensibility it would be happy for me    Why you seem to be out of spirits says the Colonel what is the matter  Matter returns Charles holding up a parcel of billshere's the cause of my disquiet we have not been here two months and here are bills to the  amount of Â£ without Â£ to pay them  Its all a mystery to me says Ramble come unravel it  My mad sister answered Charles to whose fanciful schemes I have ever been the dupe took it into her head to bring me to London in order to make my fortuneYou know Colonel how inadequate my little estate in Devonshire is and the trifle my father left us for such an undertaking but so it is come she would and I have been fool enough to follow her  at this instant Miss Simple joined them and addressing the Colonel said she supposed  her brother with his long face had been telling him some dismal story and on Ramble's saying he had been telling him of his embarrassment she replied with haste  I wont hear a word his embarrassments are all ideal bugbears of his own fancy had he taken my advice he might now have been in the first situation but he's so full of his  ifs  and his  buts  and his  this  and  that  and  t'other  that I lose all patience when I talk to him I brought him here to make a man of him but his reasons as he calls them sneering his scruples and his qualms of conscience have disconcerted all my measures the wisest schemes the best  laid plans  The Colonel was willing to soften her patience with a  you'll certainly allow  she interrupting him said  I will allow nothingI when I am right I never propose a thing to him but he immediately interrupts me and overturns all with his  can'ts  and all the rest of his silly objectionsI  can't  marry an old womanI  can't  risk a duel to run off with a girlI  can't  run in debtI  can't  cheat at cards I  can't  drinkI  can't  swearI  can't  liein short he can do nothing as men of fashion do I don't know what will become of him and all  Hold hold  says the Colonel the  world is not bad    No  badness  in the case returns she Can Â£ be a  bad  lot though an old woman with her decayed furniture should be thrown into it Can a prick of an arm be a  bad  thing when a fine girl is by to suck the wouldCan a few debts be a  bad  thing when debts now stamp the man of fashion and distinguish him from the vulgar Can  I'll appeal to the Colonel says Charles  I'll appeal to no one retorts sheI know I am in the right  Indeed Charles  interrupts the Colonel  the women are always in the right and the less we say the better  So I have always told him adds Miss Simple now only hear  Colonel what I have proposed I would first have had him stood for a neighbouring boroughNo says he the county is overstocked with members of Parliament besides was I ever chosen I have no eloquence to recommend me Eloquence nonsense say I eloquence is the only thing that would hurt himYou know Colonel the minister wants nobody to talk but himself it is your dumb orators he wants men whose arguments are all comprized in the monosyllables  aye  and  no  Between you and I Charles says the Col there is too much truth in this observation    In short Sir replies  Miss Simple all his objections are visionary  Charles shewing her the bills exclaimed  these are not visionary sister these are realities that must be attend to  but she snatching them out of his hand tearing them and cramming them into her pocket cried  psha nonsense a man of spirit would think nothing of a thousand of them People of fashion will have as many in a short time as will hang their walls and pass them with as little notice as a parcel of old visiting cards behind a glass when the visits are paid  This said she left him in a pet  CHAP VI  MISS Simple being gone the gentlemen were more at liberty to talk the matter over and Charles gave my friend Will some account of an application he had made to a moneylending Jew Charles had a good heart always felt for the distresses of a friend and was the more surprised when he found a contrary disposition in others Whilst he had a guinea more than the pressing occasion of the moment called for he  was ever ready to accommodate a friend with the loan of it Ramble had as good a heart and this fellowfeeling often brought them both into difficulties I never yet said Charles found any of those grateful returns Colonel which you have so often dinged in my ears We often meet with acquaintance ready to assist us when we stand in no need of it but no one more backward when we have recourse to them nay they will desert us when we can no longer entertain them like insects they buz and flutter in the sunshine of prosperity but fall off like leaves at the approach of winter My friend Will could not but acquiesce in these sentiments he had seen but little of the world but  still had met with this ingratitude However he enlivens the conversation Charles related his interview with the Jew he had mentioned I had said he an occasion to apply to this man for a few hundreds once before and having regularly paid him the interest concluded I should meet with little difficulty in getting from him the loan of l more But added he had you seen the long face he made on his introduction you would have sworn he thought I as going to borrow money of him without interest "Mordecai said I I am in want of l for twelve months can you lend it to me" On vat security returned he I answered him my own bond Bonds  replied he are poor securities when gentlemen plead their inability to give them and of course are of no validity  It wash but de oder day I lent Sir Michael Spendthrift l on his bond and shudgment and when I called on him for de intereshd he told me he wash under age when he gave the bond and I am no Christian if I did not take him by the hardness of his features to be forty years old I never was more desheeved in all my loife  I told him he should not be so taken in by  me  for I would produce him a parishcertificate of my age His answer was  Parishes are as desheetful as parishioners I have no reliance on Christians or Christian parishes I  had rather have a good eshtate in my hands than an EastIndia bond of double the value""But I have had money of you before my dear Mordical said I and why be so particular now  "So mosh the worse" retorted he  the more a man owes the less able he is to pay and I always make it a rule in lending money upon pershonal security to demand a larger premium for a second loan than the first the rishk being greater If we lend a thousand pounds for a premium of l we alwash expect l for the second thousand and so in proportion If you will give me a good mortgage at per cent and thus cover the l you have had I  will lend you this l for a premium of per cent and a very good bargain you will have for money is now very scarsh and I should not know where to borrow a thousand myself If I wanted it  It was in vain to reason this fellow into moderation or argue with him against his own interest I therefore gave the matter up for not having yet mortgaged my little patrimony I will not do it if I can help it  Then you shall help it now said my friend Will for though I am short of cash as I must borrow a sum for myself I may as well borrow a little more for you I have a security or two which my father left independent of his estate and it may as well stand  responsible for your's as for mine  I thank you my good friend replied Charles but I cannot think of it after what I have said it would be like begging the money  Tush replies Will smiling your sister will find out some new scheme of remaking your fortune and then you may return it But joking aside if you never pay I shall never ask it The sum I lend you I shall consider as spent and will be more frugal in consequence I loved your father and I am sure you have a good heart and if a man who has money will not retrench a little to be of use to mankind and not occasionally part with a little to do a friendly and a generous action his money  is of little use to him and he lives to little purpose  The Colonel promised to see him in a few days and accordingly left him  Charles now returned to his sister who had a new scheme in her head and was eager to communicate it and not having told her of the Colonel's promise she attacked him with  There is brother now but one resource left usneck or nothingyou must go off with the landlord's daughter  The master of the Hotel knew little but the art getting money and of that he had amassed a considerable fortune in other respects he was exceedingly  weak his name was Whip He had an only child a daughter as silly and weak as himself her mother indeed had a little more knowledge and foresight but as weak men are generally most obstinate she could do little in opposition to her husband The girl had a smattering for music and her father thinking her wonderfully clever indulged her in this  penchant  to a ridiculous excess It was owing to his fondness for this girl and Charles and his sister having some knowledge of music and taking notice of her that induced the landlord to give them the credit he had done for these people in general soon find out the circumstances of their guests and  never suffer them to run up a long bill unless where there is plenty of money to pay it  Brother says Miss Simple to Charles I have made the landlord's daughter absolutely believe you are a man of fortune and desperately in love with hershe has ten thousand pounds left her by an uncle and her father if he pleases can give her twice as much for she is an only child she's a silly girl believes every thing    Miss Dolly Whip says I for that was her name my brother's passion for you is so ardent  On Charles's endeavouring to speak she stopped him short with  Do be quiet  where was Iohis so ardent that for this month past he has been wanting to break his mind to you but not having had an opportunity of meeting you alone has requested me to plead his cause for him and is willing to settle  Charles still wishing to say something and beginning with "But" she a second time stopped him  now  but  again always interrupting me with your  if's  and your  but's  you dearly love to hear yourself speakthere is no edging in a word for youI have quite forgot where I waswell no matter I have done the business you can have no objections here she's young and pretty we will take her to  Paris you shall there marry her beg pardon of the father promise that you will never do the like again and throw yourself upon his mercy There is little fear of  her  she hates home is eager for an elopement and will do any thing I advise her to  CHAP VII  AT this hotel there were two singular clubs one consisting of fat men and the other of lean none were admitted into the former that weighed less than twenty stone and none into the latter that weighed more than ten they met always on the same day and indeed  in the same room for the long room in this house was divided on this occasion by a sliding partition into two the fat clubroom was called the Cormorant that of the lean club the Weesel the first was furnished with elbow chairs pipes and tobacco the latter with little else than newspapers for the members of the lean club had not spirit enough to indulge themselves with good living and of course were less in the interest of Whip The cormorantclub he would observe was worth continuing they eat and drank to some purpose but the weeselclub cost him more in newspapers than all the profit he got by their welchrabbits and sneakers of punch They established fines among  themselves to keep them to time and they both met at the same hour The members of the cormorant were true guttlers  What have you for supper Dick said Gorger the first comer to the waiter "A fine chickenturtle answered he a sovereign haunch covered with fat and a few other trifles  Gorger licking his chops and clapping the waiter upon his back returned  that's a brave fellowHow long before supper  Full half an hour said Dickthe cook tells me a little accident has happened in the kitchen that has put it back  Gorger alarmed at the account cried "Gadsonot to the turtle I hope" Dick set him at ease on this head and he  went on  I cannot wait half an hour bring me something by way of whet  Aye a whet a whet was the general cry for several now came in whilst he was talking to the waiter The room was up one pair of stairs and Swag one of the members whom a flight of stairs always put out of breath said  I must wote for having our clubroom on the groundfloor or in a little time I shall not be able to reach it  Why indeed master Swag returned Gorger you seem to improve on turtle and venison We shall have no occasion to weigh you out of our society  for this man weighed more than stone They now took to their pipes and the smoke making its way  into the adjoining room Hectic and Weezen two members of the lean club began coughing at each other To these entered Starveling Drybones and others When they were got into conversation they made themselves merry at the expence of the gentlemen in the other room Weezen the dryest fellow of the company told the following story of Gorger a member of the fat club  Not long since said he a friend of mine called on him about noon and found him in the greatest distress you can conceive stamping and roaring as if in the utmost agonies What is the matter master Gorger says his friend you have not lost your wife and your darling child  I hope Wife returned he oh nothere never was so unfortunate a man    Any ship you have underwritten lost at sea says my friend Shah shah replies Gorger fretfully no shipthat would not have vexed me Sure Providence has marked me out for affliction  Then stamping and roaring again he went on  no shipno wifeno sonIf you  must  know the causeI am invited at four to two turtles and a haunch and can be but at one of them Had they been pitched at two four and six I might have been at them all  In the other room the members were in the height of spirits when in comes Bolter to whom Gorger addressed himself with  Have you heard any thing of the accident below Supper is a long time a coming Yes replied Bolter I was present when the mischief was done The careless rascal of a cook did not cover the pan in which the turtle was stewing and so the soot fell into it  At this the whole company to the number of or rose up greatly alarmed Had the staircase been on fire and they had no means of escape they could not have been more so but Bolter a little calmed them by faying "he luckily was in the kitchen enquiring after supper  and having a steady hand offered his assistance got off the greatest part of it and saved a few mouthfuls of the green fat What said Swag will a  few mouthfuls be among so many of us Make yourself easy about that  replied Bolter  Those few mouthfuls I have secured patting his belly are safe lodged here  It is impossible to give my readers a good description of the contrasted figures of these two clubs Gorger was of middle stature but the enormity of his bulk took off from his height and though near five feet ten inches high he did not appear more than five feet His head was very small in proportion and was stuck in so low between his shoulders as to have little or no neck nor was he able to look back without turning his whole body this with a pair of full set eyes  stamped gluttony in his countenance Swag was of another make his bulk was partial and collected itself accordingly He had such a protuberance of belly that its weight occasioned it to hang down between his knees and not having a proper foundation to support it was with every motion continually on the swag He was a cheerful fellow however as fat men generally are and was appointed president of the society as filling the great chair best He has been known in a warm evening to yield a quart of liquid fat that dropped in the course of a few hours from the pendant part of his belly into a pan placed between his legs When he rode he wore a pair of buckskin breeches whose waistband  reached to his bosom which had a line of buttons and this waistcoat sloping off from the second button of this enormous waistband above gave him a droll appearance Others were of another cast but equally laughable Of the lean club Drybones was a sinewy mortal more like a dryed preparation of a dead muscular subject than a living one his joints cracked as he moved and when he chanced to gape it was always with fear he should not be able to close his mouth again He had a very spare hungry countenance with hard features truly the index of a fretful discontented mind and though he was near six feet high he did not weigh more than nine stone Weezen was on the other hand  rather the shadow of a man than otherwise scarce reached five feet in height and weighed under six stone His voice was shrill and pining and nature having deprived him of that fleshiness behind that seats a man at his ease he was obliged to supply its want by a thick quilting in his breeches Hectic was a consumptive man with high sharp cheekbones so weak and tottering in his frame that you might blow him down a continual cough suffused his eyes with tears and between them and his mouth his handkerchief was always employed The general character of the members of the fat club was heartiness conviviality and mirth  that of the lean club peevishness illnature and misery  CHAP VIII  MY friend Will had very few acquaintances in London but was making fresh every day and the hotel where he lodged gave him many opportunities Having little to employ him and waiting for the arrival of Miss Raspe he fell in with three or four extraordinary characters that perhaps to a man of his observation and the knowledge and entertainment he drew from them was  more than fell to his share Among these were Mr Spatter Tom Rattle Dick Dangle Sir Lucius Vapour Jack Lattitat and others  Spatter was a communicative prating fellow that loved to entertain you with the chitchat of the town He had the  entreÃ©  of every house and of course knew what was doing in every fashionable family he would talk big with the men and small with the women and thus would makefree with the characters of those he knew and like all gossips accommodate himself to all parties In short he was a true male gossip He had promised my friend Will to introduce him at Brookes's was according to his  own account intimate with every tonish man there and could ensure a ballot in his favour Brookes's was a place where Ramble was desirous of admission and relied on Spatter for an introduction one day he asked him if he had put up his name at Brookes's according to his promise Spatter who by the bye had no admission there himself but only boasted of the honor to give him a degree of  Ton  scarce knew how to parry this direct question  Brookes's my dear Colonel said he is not as it was When that subscription consisted only of the first characters in the kingdom it was an honour to be seen among them but since they have admitted all the riffraff of the  town it is disreputable to be seen in the Society  To tell you a secret I mean to withdraw my  own  name  Come come says Ramble this is only a polite get off  Noupon my honor  returned Spatter  well then if you must have itI  did  propose you but such is the capriciousness of men that though you stand well with the world though the subscription consists of near members though I made all the friends I could and that among the leading men Lord Random Count Trifle Sir Jeffery Lounge and many other yet  Ramble out of patience with this roundabout story  saw throught it and anticipated what Spatter was unwilling to declare by saying  he supposed he was blackballed  even so returns Spatter shrugging but no matter don't be uneasy I mean to quit in myselfand if ever I put  my  name up a second timethey may blackball me and welcome    Uneasy cried Ramble You mistake me quite if you suppose me  uneasy  It would ill become a man of sense to be hurt at such an eventI assure you I  rejoice  at it    Rejoice says Spatter  Yes rejoice returns Ramble  rejoice  to learn there are four hundred men in the world so much better than myself  This business settled says Spatter tell me Colonel how you are disposed this evening There's a rout at Lady Dashit's to which I have a card of invitation if you are for a party of halfcrown whist I'll introduce you Her Ladyship's a lively woman and will be happy to see any friend of mine    I think replied Ramble I have heard of this Lady Is not she a learned woman a woman of great reading Is not Dangle acquainted with her    Dangle says Spatter is  entre nous  as great a fool as her Ladyship she wishes to pass with the world for a woman of erudition but I say no more it's a good house of rendezvous you'll see a  great deal of world there and if you'll go I'll introduce you Name your hour and I'll call for you and take you in my carriage    I suppose returns Ramble nine will be a good hour if you'll call upon me then you'll find me at home  CHAP IX  DOLLY Whip I have observed had a little notion of music and sung prettily which she was induced to attend to more than ordinary from an opportunity it gave her of being more frequently in company with Charles  Simple and his sister Her mother was a plain woman but foresaw the ill effects it might produce and liked neither the amusement nor the company it led her into  'Tis intolerable Dolly said she one day to see you spending half your time drumming on that wooden box playing the fool up and down and acting as you do  for a taste for singing led her also to acting and she would occasionally take off the singers on the stage  This enthusiasm of your father's in music plays and the like must end in his ruin and it ill becomes a girl of your fortune to be thus wasting your time  And on her saying in return she should like of all things to be an actress  would rate her with  Hussy do you know what an actress is    Yes Mamma says she there are a great many lords and ladies actresses now Music and acting Miss Simple says are all the mode nothing else is talked of The newspapers don't tell us that Miss Suchaone of ten thousand pounds fortune and Miss Suchaone of twenty thousand is arrived in town or has left it but they are continually speaking of the musical peopleStorace is engaged at the operahouse Marchesi is gone to Italy Rubinelli is to supply his place Why Mamma these operasingers must be much coveted when they are sent for so far to entertain us Miss Simple says  kings can make dukes generals and admirals but no one can make operasingers but the pope I asked her how that was but she would not tell me Now Mamma let me ask you whether my singing does not constantly bring a great deal of good company to our house that turns out to Papa's benefit  And on the mother's saying  Yes company that will ruin  him  if they don't ruin  you  she went on  They are too complaisant to ruin me you can't conceive what fine things they say to me and are always on their knees kissing my hand and praising my beauty Count Bragoni says I am an angel Baron Brigel a divinity  the Chevalier calls me a Cecilia and Sir Michael Molasses declares my breath is sweeter than a sugarcane Mr A calls me enchanting Mr B is in raptures with my eyes Mr C with my shape one with my teeth another with my neck and another with the small of my leg  Her mother who had during this long speech been industriously darning her daughter's apron could bear it no longer she reddened up took her spectacles off her nose and cried  Hold your nonsense girl with your A's your B's and your C's you may run through the whole alphabet at  this rateyou seem to have been practising these expressions  Such was the simplicity of this girl and it is easy to see how ready a prey she would become to the despoiler It was fortunate she fell not into worse hands than Charles Simple Well might Mrs Whip upbraid her husband with his musical infatuation well might she say to him  You are not aware of the consequences this music will not only be the ruin of your daughter but of yourself you are surrounded with a parcel of sharpers that eat and drink and live in the house and never think of paying They watch your child's fortune  'tis their whole business There's Miss Simple has already turned her brain she is as restless as her tongue and is too busy not to be hatching some scheme or other She promised yesterday to pay off her bill instead of that she is paying you off with music I hate these  musical  notes I'd rather have one  bank  note than a thousand of them  As Mrs Whip foresaw the snare laid for her daughter took effect she eloped a few days after with Charles and his sister to Calais without waiting for the Colonel's pecuniary assistance and the young couple were there married My friend Will enquired into the sequel  and found it had ended as it was planned Mrs Simple wrote to her father the  faux pas  was forgiven and Charles became master of her fortune It is not every adventure that ends so well  CHAP X  SPATTER called on Will Ramble and conveyed him to Lady Dashit's where he was agreeably entertained  This lady was the widow of Sir Barnaby Dashit a sugarbaker in Puddinglane  She was very much confined during the life of her husband whose whole thoughts were centered in his business and thus became what in the city they call a monied man but poor fellow no sooner was he laid in his grave than his widow then between forty and fifty became possessed of the whole of his fortune and being the daughter of a city knight a little more refined in his notions and who suffered his family to figure away at Pewterer'shall and the Mansionhouse on the two high city festivals imbibed a spirit of gentility and set out afresh in life by taking a house at the west end of the town She was a very vain weak woman and nothing hurt that vanity more  than the admiration a niece of her's by her husband's side received from the gentlemen that visited at her house for this young lady being an orphan was placed with Lady Dashit at the age of sixteen and continued with her after she became mistress of her fortune which amounted to thirty thousand pounds in the funds Miss Trevor for that was her name was an amiable young lady of great female accomplishments with a moderate share of beauty and renowned for her modesty and prudent deportment  Ramble had he not lost his heart before would effectually have done it on his first introduction at Lady Dashit's  for he often declared had he not met with Miss Raspe and made proposals of marriage to her he should instantly have become Miss Trevor's admirer  Philosophers say in accounting for love at first sight that there is a certain emanation flowing from the human heart forming as it were an atmosphere round the frame of every individual that like the property of the loadstone has an attractive and repellent power and that when two of different sexes meet so near as to be within the circle of that emanation this magnetic power operates in a less or greater degree and occasions what we either call love or disgust but where such emanation of corresponding  responding hearts exists there is a mutual sympathy of soulWhether this be true in the present case I will not say but my friend Ramble was very much taken with Miss Trevor and Miss Trevor very much smitten with him  And their eyes told each other  What neither dare name  There were assembled a large group of people of almost all descriptions both men and women among the former were Ned Saunter and Dick Dangle of whom I shall speak more hereafter  Not liking to play at cards he became one of a small party who was listening to an extraordinary conversation that took place between Lord Random  and the elder Miss Gadabout a lady about thrity years of age who seemed to try who should have the best of the argument on a subject of gallantry Miss Gadabout observing to Lord Random that he came very late  I should have been here an hour agosaid he had it not been for two foolish letters from two foolish women which were brought me at the very moment I was stepping into my carriage I have no conception how they knew I was come to town for I arrived only the day before    Oh I can tell you said Miss Gadabout archly you sent to them  Lord Random did not receive this rebuke with that pleasantry he ought but illnaturedly replied  Your remark would be a just one did not the ladies in this polite age save the gentlemen that ceremony by taking the trouble of finding out their arrival themselves  In short Miss Gadabout's keen reply disconcerted Lord Random so much that he turned from her and addressed his conversation to other ladies to whom he related so many anecdotes degrading to the sex that they must have had more than common good temper to listen to him Miss Gadabout was made acquainted with this and took him to task for it  Do you think it generous My Lord said she to speak so lightly of and defame the  women you are pleased to say you have loved    Were  I  not indiscreet Madam returned his Lordship they would be so themselves Have I then no claim on their gratitude for sparing them the necessity of it For one woman who wishes to keep her amour a secret there are thousands that glory in making it public That censure My Lord said Miss Gadabout "is too severe Though there are women that are not virtuous it does not follow that such women are libertines You paint them in such bad colours that one would think they surrendered as soon as attacked  "There are Madam returned his Lordship  unluckily  so many examples in support of my opinion that it is more ridiculous to think it false than illnatured to believe it true  "As your Lordship retorts Miss Gadabout  speaks your thoughts so freely I wonder at the folly of those women who have placed their happiness in your constancy and trusted their fame to your discretion What arts did your Lordship make use of to make such dupes of them    Arts Madam  answered his Lordship examining himself from head to feet  I have no hypocrisy trust me I leave that to those less indebted to nature The vanity of the women Madam has been my constant friend Through this and this  alone I have always found the way to their hearts The honour of being courted by a man of gallantry and rank is with many a sufficient motive not even to wait the declaration of our sentiments  Miss Gadabout could scarce keep her temper but still wished to let him down in the eyes of those who were listening to the conversation She told his Lordship she was sure from his assertions if there was truth in them that he could only have associated with bad company  If you make no distinction replied his Lordship between then woman who has a lover and the woman noted for her libertinism I will confess I keep only bad company for  among all the women of my acquaintance I do not know one who either is not or has not been in love  Love cries Miss smartly How easily you prostitute that wordCan your Lordship truly say that you have been loved or was ever in love yourself    I neither  can  answered he nor  will  I say any such thing Love is a passion unknown in the great world and I do not see what we lose by being strangers to it I call love a pleasure or the art of inspiring desires and of living a happy life for the heart ought never to be laid under restraints I am always tempted to turn inconstant when I perceive a woman studies to captivate me    How would you behave asked Miss Gadabout if you discovered that the object of your love was inclined to infidelity    I would if possible said he be beforehand with her  "Delightful" said Miss Gadabout  And yet there have been women who have thought you amiable    I should be more surprized returned his Lordship fi they had not loved me for those very defects you condemn especially when they find we glory in such defects merely to countenance their whims their caprices and their levity We are inconstant Are they less faithless Do they not study rather to create  desires  in the men that  esteem  Reflect a moment and you  will not find singularity either in my conduct or my manner of thinking  At this Miss Gadabout lifted up her eyes and advised his Lordship never to pay his addresses to a woman of sense as he never could be happy in an attempt to please her Lord Random was even with her for he told her with a sneer that he was afraid he never should have occasion to remember her advice  Lady Dashit seemed to ogle almost all the men was jealous of the admiration paid to Miss Trevor and made herself truly ridiculous Ramble being here introduced he obtained the  entrÃ©e  of the house become frequently a vistitor and was always well received  Spatter gave him to understand that Dangle was an admirer of Miss Trevor but this did not strike him at that time though afterwards he was made better acquainted with it  Spatter called on him the next morning to talk over the amusements of the evening before and gave him a concise but illnatured history of all the company He said that Miss Trevor was a fine girl that Dangle was a happy man for he was seen to steal out of Lady Dashit's house one morning at daybreak unpowdered and in dishabille Report says continued he that he came out at the parlourwindow for he Ladyship always keeps the key of the  streetdoor at night in her own custody and that Miss Trevor concealed him till the company were gone behind one of the windowcurtains  Ramble with a degree of indignation said she was a modest wellbehaved young lady and he had too good an opinion of her to give credit to such a report that he was quite enamoured with her and could not bear to hear a story propagated so much to her disadvantage in which he was persuaded there was not the least shadow of truth  Mistake me not Colonel says Spatter confused I do not mean to say the factis so I only give it as a  reportGod forbid it should gain ground to her discreditTo besure Miss Trevorwillcertainly she is a very lovely girlBut surely Colonel you don't think of her as a wife She'll make a horrid bad one for admitting the  whole  of the story respecting Dangle not to be true I'll be sworn there's something in it for her house is become the rendezvous of all the young fellows about town Rapraprap rapraprapDamme if the knocker is not always agoing but I don't wonder at it flies will be buzzing in the sunshine I shall be rapping at her myself before it is long  CHAP XI  SCARCE and Spatter left the room but in came Jack Latitat splashed and out of breath  Dmn it says he I have given two of the keenest bloodhounds the finest run throught St James's Park imaginable and thrown them quite off their scent after a circuit of twenty minutes in which I was but a few yards before them I led them through the cloisters of St James's house out of one court into another so from the Stableyard into the Park again Atthe Palace I losr sight  of them as great men there generally do their followers Had they kept me in view into the Park again I'd have run them hard up Constitutionhill and would have been bound to have knocked them up before they reached the Parkgate I keep myself in wind on purposeI never enjoyed a chase so much in my life It poured so fast from the heavens that all the Park was in motion so that our running was not noticed    By the embroidery and spangles on your coat said Ramble I suppose they were Customhouse officers in pursuit of contraband goods You would have been a fine seizure    Customhouse officers I'faith returned Jack not  abit not abit the dogs that chased me were true blood up to the very nose of themnothing less than  Sheriffs  officers Do you know I lodge in Spring Gardens in the verge of the court and when any man thinks proper to take out a writ against me I soon make him sick of it These fellows won't long follow a man that gives them much trouble and I never fail to give them enough of it Whenever I find myself beset I give the rascals a chace or two through the Parks and they have done with me" And why all this replied Ramble Your father left you a pretty fortune enough to live handsomely upon I see no reason why you should be thus  continually running the gauntlet and keeping yourself in hot water    Love it of all things retorted he 'tis the joy of my life besides Will such kind of reasoning betrays in you a want of world You pretend to have  more  knowledge and foresight into things than other men I tell you you have  less  a dmned deal less  Sure returned Ramble there can be no knowledge or foresight in running in debt and being afraid of a bailiff    Not only knowledge and foresight replied he my dear friend but a great deal of prudence and a great deal of discretion    The devil's in it replied Ramble warmly if there can be any discretion in running  up a debt you will never be able to pay that will tend to the injury of your creditors and make your own heart ach    Phshaw Will answered he that's begging the question You are a bad philosopher and of course a bad reasoner 'Tis  want  of  principle  that makes many men run in debt but it is  love  of  principal  that leads me to it May father left me twenty thousand pounds What is that to maintaina gentleman The most I can make of it is one thousand pounds a year a poor principal for a man to figure away with in these expensive times It won't half do it and a man may as well do nothing as do it by halves Now  my plan is to double my principal by borrowing twenty thousand pounds of the world putting it out to use and making my income  two  thousand a year instead of  one    HowWhatIt's all a paradox said Ramble "This my dear Will resumed he is a proof that  I  have knowledge and foresight and that  you  have none For example and putting the fore finger of his right hand with a degree of selfconsequence upon and pressing gently the inside of the thumb of his left hand with a little of that knowledge and foresight you recommend to me you will find by calculation that as two and two make four if one twenty thousand pounds  produces one thousand pounds a year interest twice the sum will produce two thousand pounds and if I can't live upon  one thousand  pounds a year I may upon  two  "Go on" said Ramble full of thought and attention to his reasoning  Now continued he this second twenty thousand pounds I am borrowing of the world    That is to say interrupted Ramble you are running in debt    Exactly so replied he and I am as eager to get  into  debt as thousands would be to get  out  of it I labour hard strain every nerve ransack my imagination nay sometimes contrary to my natural disposition I use artifice cunning and make it my  study to get into debt and for the soul of me cannot effect it There's Dick Thoughtless dmn me if he was not five thousand pounds in debt before he knew where he was but he has knowledge by instinct and like all the monkies of the age possesses cunning without the art of communicating it I have been running in debt these three years and have not been able to owe five thousand yetOh I am an unlucky dog Had my father brought me up a merchant I might have got twenty thousand pounds in debt in six months but it is the misfortune of gentlemen that though the goodnanatured part of the world are well disposed  sed to them and require but little aplication we are such blockheads as not to know how to apply to them I hope however to accomplish my purpose before I am two years older I was lucky enough the other day being in good credit to touch Bod Corkscrew the hardwareman for fifteen hundred poundsworth of Birmingham goods which I have consigned to a friend in Portugal and am to have my remittances in wine which I shall readily dispose of among my own friends So you see Will I have a little smattering for trade Necessity has no  legs  say the Latin proverb and my father little studied his son's interest when he made a  gentleman of him for had he put me into a good wholesale business with twenty thousand pounds I should have been worth a plumb before this time    Possessed  of one my dear Jack you might have been but not  worth  one returned he for no man can be worth what he cannot call his own    I deny the conclusion retorted he Every man is worth what he can make use of The rascal without  principle  is a  worthless  man but the wellmeaning man with  principal  is a man of  worth  and therefore a  worthy  man That's logic I fancy my dear Will I shall beat you all hollow in argument  Though Ramble abhorred his conduct he could  not but smile at his reasoning and begged him to shew him in what sense of the word he was a wellmeaning man for that being the  major  of his argument if the  major  was overthrown the conclusion was destroyed  By wellmeaning said he is understood a man who means well Now I accept of credit with all the good intentions in the world to ease the fools of their useless money encourage trade serve myself and do credit to my family and connexions Every man who lends me in this style charges a profit proportionable to the extent of credit he gives and will never be angry with me if he gets his money at last If he did not thus lend it to me he  would perhaps squander it but by disposing of it in the manner I thus draw it from him if I should never be able to pay him in the course of my life he will find it in my treasury at my death    Then you do not squander and dissipate the money you thus get upon credit said Ramble Oh Will Will  cried he laying his palm of his hand gently on my friend's forehead and smiling on him with a kind of pitiable contempt  Thou do'st want foresight indeed If I squandered it I should be a  worthless  man and not a man of  worth  Why I  hoard  it for them I am their  banker  a current of public money thus runs through my shop and surely for  this care and attention I have as great right to the interest of that money as a banker has to the interest of the cash deposited in his house    I grant you returned Ramble if like a banker you could return the cash when called on    Bad reasoning gain Will retorted he They do not want it back for a great length of time It is the long credit they give that justifies their enormous charges Why does a breachesmaker charge two guineas and a half for a pair of buckskin breeches that he could on prompt payment afford to sell for half the money It is because this knave chooses to lend me his money and demands an enormous interest  through a fear of my never returning it Now if I  never  return it it is but the biter bit or the fool caught in his own trap On the contrary if I  do  pay him no matter when at my death or otherwise twothirds of his bill I pay him perhaps contrary to his expectation with an ample profit If he receives the whole of his bill he gets  cent per cent  and has reason to revere my memory as long as he lives Old Staytape the Taylor of CoventGarden was never worth a groat till the death of hte first Duke of Cumberland but as soon as he got the money the Prince owed him and which he was fearful he never should get he lived like a Prince himself kept his  girl a postchaise and four and a snug box in the country and drank claret  But there are men Jack replied Ramble that will not wait till you die What then    I scramble through life say he with such as well as I can and stop the mouth of a gaping creditor with part of his money take up credit with B to pay it to C and run them occasionally up Constitutionhill till they are out of breath Something may happen in the chapter of accidents to get rid of such rascals before a good round legacy a place at court or a rich wife but this should be my last resource and if disappointed after all the forty thousand pound stock at my  death will balance the whole Thus you see my dear Will that your friend Latitat is neither so dissipated or so  worthless  a being as you are apt to conceive him and if he runs in debt it is from a  love  of  principal  as I said and not from a  want  of it What would become of the Fxs the Hres and Shns of the age was it not for the good nature of the trading part of this kingdom who are always at work for them who make them a tender of their property almost unasked and who are only unhappy when they do not accept of it I only wish such men could lay their hands upon their hearts and say they borrowed it upon the  same principle that I do  Logical sophistical and elusive as Jack's reasoning was Ramble could not but admire the ingenuity of it  How apt are we to reason ourselves into the belief of things we wish and reconcile ourselves by fallacious arguments to faults and errors consonant to our dispositions Such is the perversity of human nature that though we wish to stand well with the world and though we covet the good opinion of those we are acquainted with we have not resolution to contend with our passions and act in a manner that we should commend in others but give way to the bias of a corrupt mind and labour to  deceive mankind by a specious colouring of faults Jack's arguments were fallacious in the extreme Fashionable young men who run in debt squander as fast as they acquire and put it out of their power to pursue their first aim but was it even possible to increase a man's income by such modes as he talked of it would not be only wrong but iniquitous such however is the disposition of these men that they are no more at a loss for a pretext to colour their base actions than was the wolf in the fable who wanted to devour the lamb on a charge that she had mudded the stream above him  CHAP XII  LADY Dashit had an intriguing chambermaid whose name was Bridget she was as is too often the case the confidante of both the ladies a froward pert hussey courted by the valet of Mr Dangle and had planned in her own mind a scheme that her sweetheart Tom should be introduced by her to her old lady as a man of rank marry her and thus cheat her of her fortune Indeed the weakness and vanity of Lady Dashit contributed not a little to the plan "Tom  said Bridget one day when he brought a letter from his master to her young mistress  I long very much to see you I have the finest scheme in my head that ever chamber maid devised  and the sollowing dialogue passed between them  Bridget  You must know that my old lady has lately taken it into her head to marry whenever she can find a suitable match  Tom  What has Miss Trevor and she quarrelled  Bridget  Quarrelled No not that but she has seen so many young fellows dangling about by young mistress that her old mouth waters at them Bridget  says she the other day to me as I was pinning up her lappets Miss Trevor with all her youth and all her beauty I find would not have so many admirers if it was not for her fortune Fortune is what the young men run after nowadays and though I am a few years older than her having a much better fortune and a tolerable share of beauty I do not see but that if I was to lay out for it I might get as good a husband as she can  Tom  Beauty laughing a superanuated old  Bridget  Hear me out foolas she can  in an under voice  so says I to her without doubt Ma'am you may and if you would not be displeased  I could tell you now of a certain young gentleman a man of distinction too that would be glad to have you in preference to all the slipslop girls he has yet seen  Tom  And how did she take it  Bridget  just as I expected said she would one day contrive to see him Now who do you think this young gentleman is  Tom  I do not know  Bridget  Guess  Tom  I have not the least conception  Bridget  NoA handsome streight well made young fellow  examining Tom  with a  jenesequy  air and as much brass upon his front as yourself  Tom  I thank you kindly for the compliment  Bridget  Can't you guess now  Tom  Not I  Bridget  Dull oaf that though necessity obliges him sometimes to wear a cast coat is as much of a gentleman  examining Tom again  as any gentlemanvalet need be  Tom  But you called him a man of distinction  Bridget  Suppose I did There are men of distinction in every class  I  will distinguish him I will give him a title and introduce him as a great man and when he marries my lady he shall give me half her fortune  Tom  Oh now I understand you  Bridget  You do And if you had had the understanding of a goose you might have done so before I have considered your situation Tom and as at best it is but a disagreeable one I will put you upon a method of changing it  Tom  I beg your pardom my situation is far from being a disagreeably one to a silly fellow I own it is a troublesome employment but to a lad of spirit it is full of charms A superior genius that goes to service does not confine himself to the menial offices of his employ he goes into a family to  command  rather than to  obey  he begins by studying his master he accommodates  himself to his foibles gains his confidence and thus leads him by the nose  Bridget  Impudence Well but as a good fortune is still better and as you are a smart fellow Tom and don't want for assurance I have fixed upon you to court my mistress  Tom considering  That can't beno I can't possibly think of itI am engaged to you  Bridget  Suppose you areand suppose I let you off if we marry as we are we must always be servants but marry  her  and we'll divide her fortune between us and then if you have that fondness for me you pretend you may have me afterwards For as  parson what d'ye call him says a man may have as many wives as he will besides as 'tis the fashion to live together in the old natural way without being married we may follow the example of our betters and leave the ceremony out of the question  Tom  Trueand it shall be so But what will the world say  Bridget  What signifies the world The world will call us wise will laugh at  her  and commend  us  You shall be Sir Thomas Flam and she shall be My Lady Flam but where can you get a dress or two to appear in  Tom  That's easily settled I have an acquaintance whose master's cloaths  will exactly fit me that master is now in the country and he has access to the wardrobe  Bridget  The very thing but not a word of this for your life I will see you again soon Mum's the word  Tom  As silent as death and with this kiss kissing her I'll seal up my lips  CHAP XIII  SPATTER had no sooner learnt that Ramble had a partiality for Miss Trevor but he posts to Lady Dashit's true gossiplike to find out how she would receive the information He did not set out on a goodnatured principle in order to give pleasure but with that illnatured satisfaction that meddlers feel in mortifying others  Spatter was a consummate slanderer hacknied in all the ways of detraction this frequently brought him into disagreeable situations but being a rank coward wherever he found that he gave offence he would eat his words and endeavour to explain away his assertions and this he had so happy a mode of doing as not to lose his acquaintance for though he was in a great measure seen through the news he was able to communicate made the lovers of tittletattle wink at his faults When Spatter paid his visit at Lady Dashit's she and Miss Trevor were at work Lady Dashit envious of the admiration Miss Trevor met with from the men had began upon the subject  You are a fortunate girl said she my dear Emily to have so many admirers    That depends Ma'am replied Miss Trevor upon opinion where a woman's vanity leads her to triumph over her lovers she has certainly means to gratify that vanity more amidst a number of suitors than when she has but one But when her affections are fixed a number of objects can be only a disagreeable interruption  Lady Dashit by her insinuating sifting manner drew from Miss Trevor a declaration that she lost her heart in the first interview with Colonel Ramble but that she feared it would be attended with no good consequences to her as she knew  little either of his disposition his connexions or his situation in life Spatter being now announced and ushered in and the company seated his first address to the ladies was  Your Ladyship looks charmingly to dayMiss Trevor how divinely bright  "Full of compliments Mr Spatter" said Lady Dashit  Compliments  Madam answered Spatter is only a fashionable word for untruths an article I never deal in as I told my Lady Bab Squeamish just now when I was drinking a dish of chocolate with her    Pray says Lady Dashit how is her Ladyship" At present replied Spatter never  better in her life though the company were a little alarmed this morning at her faintingfor she was sitting with her back to the fire which in  certain  situations ladies you know  will  cause fainting a little fresh air however and a cordial sneering soon brought her to herself  This observed Lady Dashit is the first time I ever heard any thing injurious to Lady Bab's character  Good God Madam interrupted he don't suppose I advert to any thing improper the younger part of the company 'tis true laugh'd but that I apprehend was owing to the awkward manner in which she fell No Ladies God forbid any thing I  should say should injure her ladyship in your good opinion she is supposed to have a natural aversion to the male sex but this I presume is merely a supposition If she  had  made a slip I should be the last person to divulge it You have heard I suppose Ladies of Miss Blossom's elopement with my Lord Random  Not a syllable  says Emily  Really  Good lack I wonder at that returned he for it's been all over the town these two hours  Lady Dashit somewhat inquisitive asked the particulars  Only Madam continued he that Miss Blossom has long had a secret  penchant  for his Lordship and that Random was dull enough not to see it so that Miss Blossom found herself under the necessity of declaring herself to him in writing in direct terms that Lord Random improved upon the hint and took her off in his chaise this morning before the family was stirring    Why really says Emily I had a better opinion of Miss Blossom  So had  I  Miss Trevor returned Spatter so had  I  till this unlucky affair happened for to be sure Miss Blossom always preserved a proper decorum till she found it  necessary  to wear a hoop  Indeed says Lady Dashit  to Miss Trevor how wonderfully strange all this is  'Tis much more strange to me ladies retorts he that you should not have heard of it before I must request however that you will not quote  me  upon the occasion for Miss Blossom is a young lady for whom I have the highest respect and I would not for the world any thing should get abroad to her discredit I naturally supposed that  you must  have heard what  every one  has heard or my lips would have been locked for it is a rule with  me  not to believe  half  I hear and what I  do  believe I am very cautious how I  repeat  At this the ladies could not refrain from laughing to themselves  How Sir said Lady Dashit does Mr Rattle take this    Mr Rattle cries Spatter recollecting MrRattle Ma'am You mean Colonel Ramble  No sir returned Lady Dashit I mean Mr Rattle for I understand she has long received his visits    I never understood continued Spatter pondering and rather unhappy at missing such a piece of intelligence that Rattle waited upon her Colonel Ramble indeed pretends to be over head and ears in love with  her though he never saw her above twice here the ladies expressed surprise at least he had intimated as much to me and though he wears a cockade if I was not acquainted with his  tame  disposition I should fear the consequence would be a duel  Emily struck with emotion at these words and not being able to listen to language so disrespectful and derogatory to the character of a gentleman she was pleased to think well of upbraided Spatter with seeming to insinuate a  timidily  in the Colonel and said she thought his affections were  engaged but was that not the case and he was warmly attached to Miss Blossom though he differs in sentiments from the rash young men of the age I believe him to be a gentleman of too much spirit not to resent an affront Spatter who now found he had brought himself into a difficulty stammered out  No no Miss Trevor I don't say You certainly Ma'am must have misconceived meI would only be understood to infer that Colonel Ramble is a man of gallantry loves every pretty woman he sees and courts every girl he meets and has too much world to draw his sword for any of them  Miss Trevor  could not but express her uneasiness at this story to Lady Dashit and was almost ready to faint  Spatter expressed a great deal of concern was sorry for the confusion he had occasioned was busy with his smellingbottle but chuckled in his sleeve by having by this emotion of Emily's discovered her secret sentiments of Ramble which would furnish him with a gossiping tale for the whole week"So so so so said he to himself Iv'e been doing mischief here there's more in the wind than imagined Ramble is not so indifferent in this house as I conceived Miss Trevor recovering said she  thought the Colonel had declared against a wise  The declarations of young men like him answered Spatter are little more than wind for my part I never regard any thing he says Ramble's a good natured fellow but  entrÃ© nous  one of the most idle dissipated unthinking young men in the world I have a great regard for him and it hurts me exceedingly to observe how he goes on though he has made a formal proposal to Miss Blossom to my certain knowledge he is paying his addresses to a young lady at the other end of the town    Sir  said Lady Dashit warmly the less you say of Colonel Ramble the better Miss Trevor can't bear to hear his name mentioned  Spatter still at a loss what to say the whole being rather mysterious to him wishing to get at the truth but not well knowing how and conceiving Ramble had given Miss Trevor offence begged her pardon for having started so disagreeable a subject and allowed that the Colonel was too incautious of offending  I must own continued he that Ramble is apt to carry two faces  Here he was wrong again Miss Trevor's eyes sparkled with rage  You are  the only one Mr Spatter said she with some warmth that I ever heard say so the reverse is rather his character he is too apt to speak what he thinks  Spatter more embarrassed now than ever with a kind of confused hesitation replied  I perfectly coincide with you Miss Trevorthat is  exactly  what I meanHe carries two faces that is to saya civil one to those he is pleased to think well of and a rough one to those he dislikes  Conceiving he had now reconciled words that had before offended he strutted about the room with a sort of inward triumph and selfcongratulation then turning about added  Well Ladies I'll not trespass upon you longer if you have any commands to Lord Spangle Lady Driveit or the Miss Gadabouts I shall be proud to bear them I shall see them all in my way home  With this he took his leave saying to himself as he hurried out  If I don't make haste the news will reach them before I shall be able to tell it  CHAP XIV  RAMBLE being alone one morning at his lodgings his chariot at the door waiting to take him out received an unexpected visit from Dangle whom he had not see since Spatter had acquainted him with his adventures at Miss Trevor's  You are a happy dog Dangle said he I quite envy you Caressed by the men admired by the  women and admitted to  such  tÃªteÃ tÃªtes as I would give my ears to enjoy  What was you doing the other night at Lady Dashit's Report says you was let out at the parlourwindown at daybreak    My life for it says Dangle that's one of Spatters lies he's the greatest liar in all Westminster and so used to lying that he is surprised when he catches himself at speaking truth What he knows of this business he had from me he can  improve  a story as well as any man    And  spread  it too returned Ramble he came here full of it  I wish says Dangle his evil genius may not bring him into some scrape one day or other I was there 'tis true and left the house rather late nearer  one  I believe than twelve  Nay it has got about Dangle that you was  unpowdered  and in  deshabille  That is carrying the joke too far retorts Dangle They may say what they please of  me  but I cannot suffer Miss Trevor's character to be trifled with I see then replied Ramble you  can  be nettled    Emily's a lovely girl adds Dangle the object of my idolatry and I would cut any man's throat that dare traduce her I wish  Ramble you would speak a good word for me there she has the highest opinion of  you  for with all my effrontery damme if I have assurance enough to tell her how much I love her    And you wish me to do it for you said Ramble You had better not trust me I have a partiality for Miss Trevor myself and of course shall be a poor advocate for another What would you say now if I was to rival you    You have too much honour answered he for that    Egad honour's but a feeble restraint observed Ramble where love takes the lead However if it will be doing you a good office Ill make a point of it  Pleased as  Dangle did not forget to caution the Colonel not to commit him  That pride of yours says Ramble ever stands in your way If I can bring about the  matter  never mind the  manner  This business was but just settled the servant announced Mr Rattle and Mr SaunterRattle was an active noisy fellow a buck of the first head and always  awake  his friend Saunter was the reverse an indolent lazy yawning chap ever  asleep  so indolent that he could scarce drag his legs after him I can no ways account for such men associating together except it is that  the character of one must be always a source of mirth to the other  I saw your carriage at the door says Rattle and should not have broke in upon you but to beg your company tomorrow evening at the Shakespear where the Whigclub are to meet and you will probably be entertained  I am a very moderate man says Ramble but have no objection to go with you if I find myself at liberty  Why where are you bound to replies Rattle  To the house answered Ramble of a fine woman    By all that's great added Rattle had you been with me the other night  at ConventGarden you'd have been charmed with a girl that sat in the box before me  Such  eyes  Such  a countenance  Such  a figureI never saw her equal I could not find out who she wasSaunter was there but half asleep as he always is and lost the seeing of what perhaps he'll never meet with again  My good friend replied Saunteryawning the playhouse is the only place where one can doze in your company for your damn'd rattle whenever it is set agoing is enough to rouse a whole neighhood  What sleep in a playhouse says Ramble I should think Ned  that the amusements there would keep you awake  That says Saunter among other things is a proof of your want of worldNo man of  Ton  ever goes to the Theatre for the amusements of that Theatre Do you imagine a sensible man would open his ears to the whinings of a stage or his eyes to its fopperies Formerly there was something to be  heard  and  seen  now 'tis all trick frippery and singsong No no Ramble a playhouse now is the finest afterdinner lounge that can be where a man may take a nap without fear of being disturbed by noisy coxcombs and eteranl babblers  Saunter says Rattle is now aiming to be satyrical he's too lazy to talk himself and too splenetic to hear others talk    You'd better be silent says Rableyou'll stand no chance with RattleAye Saunter take the Colonel's advice you can ill bear fatigue and talking is almost as troublesome to you as thinkingCome you may as well go with me to the Ridinghouse    With all my heart return'd Saunter yawning for I have nothing to do  Saunter says Rattle addressing himself to Ramble has a confortable time of it  his  work is always  ways done meet him when you will he's at every man's service for yawning and imitating Saunter's manner he has nothing to doBut we detain you Colonel may the girl you are going to see be as kind to you as you wish  END OF VOL I
