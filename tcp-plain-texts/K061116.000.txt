 PATIE  and  PEGGY  OR THE FAIR FOUNDLING  A  SCOTCH  BALLAD OPERA As it is Acted at the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  By His MAJESTY's Servants  Vix ea nostra Voco  With the MUSICK prefix'd to each SONG  LONDON  Printed for J WATTS at the PrintingOffice in  WildCourt  near  Lincoln'sInn Fields  MDCCXXX Price  s    PREFACE  _THAT I am indebted to Mr  Ramsay  's GENTLE SHEPHERD  a  Scotch  Pastoral Comedy  wrote Originally in  Five Acts  for the greatest Part of the following Piece was not owing to my Idleness but a Doubt of my Abilities to produce any Thing entirely New of this kind that might plead so much pretence to Favour As Nature is the same in all Ages and Climes I thought the Simplicity of Characters Manners Sentiments and Passions which has gain'd THAT POEM its Reputation cou'd not prove unentertaining to an ENGLISH AUDIENCE which  induced me to turn it into a  Ballad Opera  and as the Beauties of the Original have been thought many I have scarce ventur'd to make any farther Alterations than were absolutely necessary in bringing the Tale within the Compass of  One Act  adding to the Number of the Songs and changing it into the  English  Dialect without which it had not been intelligible to our Auditors nor indeed had I time to vary it more my  Benefit  being fix'd before I had laid my Design which was plan'd and finish'd in  one Day  When I mention my Benefit I cannot omit the Opportunity of returning my grateful humble Thanks to All whose Favours I have been so frequently honour'd with and hope I am not too vain when I declare it ever was and will be my utmost Ambition to deserve such Kindness by my frequent Endeavours whenever I may have Power and as far as my poor Capacity will allow to add to the Variety of publick Diversions The  Warmth of my Heart might make me tedious and impertinent shou'd I proceed I shall therefore only add tho' the CHARACTERS in this OPERA are  low  I flatter myself they'll not appear distasteful to the politest Circle of our ENGLISH BEAUTIES  TheatreRoyal  April  the th  T C  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Sir  William Worthy  Mr  Williams  Patie  Mrs  Roberts  Roger  Mr  Cibber  Jun  Glaud  Mr  Roscoe

grayey'd Morning begins to peep  And Darkness flies before the rising Ray  The hearty Hind starts from his lazy Sleep  To follow healthful Labours of the Day  Without a guilty Sting to wrinkle his Brow  The Lark and the Linnet he hears with Glee  And he joins their Concert driving the Plow  From Toil of Grimace and Pageantry free  While fluster'd with Wine or madden'd with Loss  Of half an Estate the Prey of a Main  The Drunkard and Gamester tumble and toss  Wishing for Calmness and Slumber in vain  Be my Portion Health and Quietness of Mind  Plac'd at due distance from Parties and State  Where neither Ambition nor Avarice blind  Reach him who has Happiness link'd to his Fate  How wholsome 'tis to snuff the cooling Air  And all the Sweets it bears when void of Care  Freely Friend  Roger  say what ails thee then  Tell me the Cause of thy illseason'd Pain  Rog  I'm born O  Patie  to a froward Fate  I'm born to strive with Hardships sad and great  Tempests may cease to swell the raging Flood  And prowling Wolves to suck our Lambkins Blood  But I opprest with neverending Grief  Must still despair of lighting on Relief  You have so soft a Voice and smooth a Tongue  You are the Darling both of Old and Young  Charm'd by your Throat our Woods with Ecchoes ring  The Lasses jeer me if I try to sing  Nature unkind denies me that sweet Art  And all my Harmony is in my Heart  Pat  The Bees shall loath the Flower and quit the Hive  Willows on marshy Grounds shall cease to thrive  E're scornful Maids or Loss of worldly Gear  Shall spoil my Rest or ever force a Tear  AIR II A New  Scotch  Tune  My  Peggy  smiles so kindly  Whene'er I whisper Love  That I look down on all the Town  That I look down upon a Crown  My  Peggy  smiles so kindly  It makes me blith and bold  My  Peggy  is a gay young Thing  And I'm not very old  In vain from me you wou'd your Sorrows hide  Your wellseen Love and scornful  Jenny  's Pride  With freedom to your Friend your Grief impart  I'll share your Griefs or case your o'erfond Heart  Confess fair  Jenny  causes all this Smart  Rog  I wish I cou'd not love her but in vain  I still must doat and feed her proud Disdain  No other Lass tho' fair my Heart alarms  They but remind me of my  Jenny  's Charms  Not Time or Absence can abate my Flame  She still is beauteous and my Love the same  Pat  Fond Swain leave off that silly whining Way  Seem careless there's my Hand you'll win the Day  AIR III Fy Gar rub her o'er with Straw  Ne'er feed her Pride with fond Respect  Who pays your Kindness with a Slight  Seem unconcern'd at her Neglect  All Women in a Man delight  But them despise who're soon defeat  And with a simple Face give way  To a Repulsethen ne'er retreat  Push boldly on and win the Day  When Maidens innocent and young  Their fond and tender Hearts belye  Ne'er mind their pretty lying Tongue  But mark the Language of the Eye  If these agree and she persist  To answer all your Love with Hate  Seek elsewhere to be better blest  And let her sigh when 'tis too late  Exeunt  Enter  Peggy  and  Jenny  Peg  Nay tell me now dear  Jenny  why the Swain  Who Loves so well you treat with cold Disdain  Faith you'll repent it shou'd his Love grow cold  What's like a scornful Maiden when she's old  AIR IV  Polwart  on the Green  Coy  Jenny  you'll repent  Shou'd  Roger  's Heart grow cold  None will your Smiles regard  Soon as your Face looks old  The froward Child thus in a Pet  Tho' 'tis by Hunger prest  Whimpers and quarrels with its Meat  'Till laugh'd at by the rest  They jest it till the Dinner's past  Thus by it self abus'd  The foolish Chit's oblig'd to fast  Or eat what they've refus'd  Ah  Jenny  think and do not lose your Time  Jenny  I never thought a single Life a Crime  Peg  Indeedbut Love in whispers tells me then  That Men were made for us and We for Men  But do you as you list for me I find  I shall be yielding as my  Patie  's kind  Jen  We soon shall hear what a distracted Life  You two will lead when once you're Man and Wise  Peg  I'll run the Risque nor have I any Fear  But rather think each tedious Day a Year  'Till I with Pleasure mount my Bridle Bed  Where on my  Patie  's Breast I'll lean my Head  Then he may kiss as long as kissing's good  And what we do there's none dare call it rude  Jen  He may indeed for ten or fifteen Days  Be fondly lavish of his Love and Praise  But Love once cloy'd what then are your Delights  Dull tedious Days and lonesome restless Nights  AIR V O dear Mother what shall I do  O dear  Peggy  Love's beguiling  We ought not to trust his smiling  Better far to do as I do  Lest a harder Luck betide you  Lasses when their Fancy's carry'd  Think of nought but to be Marry'd  Running to a Life destroys  Gladsome free and youthful Joys  Peg  Such homespun Thoughts as these want Force to move  My settled Mind I am far gone in Love  My  Patie  speaks with such a taking Art  His Words they thrill like Musick through my Heart  And his good Sense will long his Love secure  Ill Nature rests in Souls are weak and poor  AIR VI As down in a Meadow  c  How can I be sad when a Husband I've chose  That has better Sense than any of those  Sour weak silly Fellows that study like Fools  To sink their own Joy and make their Wives Tools  The Man who is prudent ne'er brawls with his Wise  Or with dull Reproaches encourages Strife  He praises her Virtue and ne'er will abuse  Her for a small Failing but find an Excuse  Jen  But what if some young Wanton he shou'd spy  With dimpled Cheek and a bewitching Eye  Peg  No more of thatdear  Jenny  to be free  Some Men in Love more constant are than we  Nor is the Wonder great when Nature kind  Has blest 'em with Solidity of Mind  AIR VII Corn Riggs are bonny  My  Patie  is a Lover gay  His Mind is never muddy  His Breath is sweeter than new Hay  His Face is fair and ruddy  His Shape is handsome middle size  He's comely in his walking  The shining of his Eyes surprize  'Tis Heaven to hear him talking  See yon two Elms that grow up side by side  Suppose 'em some Years since Bridegroom and Bride  Nearer and nearer still each Year they've press'd  Till wide their spreading Branches are increas'd  And in their Mixture now are fully blest  This shields the other from the Eastern Blast  That in return defends it from the West  Such as stand single a State lik'd by you  Beneath each Storm from every Corner bow  Jen  Peggy  I've donedear Lassie I must yield  Your better Sense has fairly won the Field  AIR VIII  Nancy  's to the Green Wood gone  I yield dear Lassie you have won  And there is no denying  That sure as Light flows from the Sun  From Love proceeds complying  For all that we can say or do  'Gainst Love no Thinker heeds us  They know our Bosoms lodge the Foe  That by the Heartstrings leads us  Exeunt  Enter  Glaud  and  Symon  Glaud  Good Morrow Neighbour  Symon  Sym  Ah old Boy  I've gather'd News will fill your Mind with Joy  'Tis fifteen Years since wise Sir  William  fled  And left a fair Estate to save his Head  But with the King return'd each Thing's in Tune  And we shall see our dear Sir  William  soon  Glaud  This makes me blithe indeedbut is it true  Tell o'er your News againand swear it too  Sym  They who sore grip'd us 'till they made us groan  Have lost their Power and away are flown  And good Sir  William  shall

his Station  That bravely stands in the Defence  Of Conscience King and Nation  Glaud  My Heart's o'erjoy'd dear Neighbour will you stay  And take your Dinner here with me today  I'll yoke my Beast and send to the next Town  To fetch a Stoop of Ale both Stout and Brown  Sym  Spoke like your self old  Glaudy  never fear  But at your Banquet I will strait appear  Glaud  I'faith we'll fill each Can and look so bold  'Till we forget all Cares or that we're old  Old said ITroth I'm younger by a Score  With this good News than what I was before  Exeunt  Enter Sir  William  Solus  Whilst thus I view around each fertile Plain  Which once I lost which now are mine again  Amidst my Joys some Prospects Pain renew  Whilst I my once fair Seat in Ruins view  But that shall be repair'd and now my Joy  Forbids all GriefWhen I'm to see my Boy  My  Patrick  now sole Object of my Care  Since Heav'n too soon call'd home his Mother fair  Him e'er the Rays of Reason clear'd his Thought  I secretly to faithful  Symon  brought  And charg'd him strictly to conceal his Birth  'Till we shou'd see what changing Times brought forth  Enter  Symon  Sym  My Master my dear Master blessed Sight  How your Return will all our Plains delight  Sir Will  Rise faithful  Symon  in my Arms enjoy  A Place thy Due kind Guardian of my Boy  But pr'ythee honest  Symon  quickly run  O'er all your Observations on my Son  A Parent's Fondness eas'ly finds Excuse  But do not with Indulgence Truth abuse  Sym  To speak his Praise the longest Summer's Day  Wou'd be too shortwou'd I his Worth display  In Word and Deed his Birth's so well confest  That out of Sight he runs before the rest  With a firm Look and a commanding way  He makes the proudest of our Herds obey  Whene'er he walks to  Edinborough  Port  He buys some Books of Hist'ry Songs or Sport  About one  Shakespear  and the famous  Ben  He often speaks and calls them best of Men  Sir Will  He's now arriv'd the Age when little Loves  Flutter around young Hearts like cooing Doves  Has no young Maiden with inviting Mein  And rosie Cheek the Wonder of the Green  Engag'd his Eye and caught his youthful Heart  Sym  I fear'd the worst but knew the smallest Part  'Till lately I have seen him Sir more sweet  With  Glaud  's fair Neice than I thought right or meet  Sir Will  This Night must end his unambitious Fire  When higher Views shall greater Thoughts inspire  Hasten then  Symon  bring him quick to me  None but yourself shall our first Meeting see  Exit  Symon  When wish'dfor Pleasures rise like Morning Light  The Pain that's past enhances the Delight  These Joys I feel that Words can ill express  I ne'er had known without my late Distress  But from his rustick Business and Love  I must in haste my  Patrick  soon remove  To Courts and Camps that may his Soul improve  Like the rough Diamond as it leaves the Mine  Only in little Breakings shows its Light  'Till artful Polishing has made it shine  Thus Education makes the Genius bright  Exit  Enter  Patie  and  Peggy  Peg  Oh  Patie  let me go I must not stay  We're both call'd home and  Jenny  she's away  Patie  I'm loth to part so soon now we're alone  And  Roger  is away with  Jenny  gone  They're as content for ought I hear or see  To be alone themselves I judge as we  Here where Primroses thickest paint the Green  Near to this purling Riv'let let us lean  Hark how the little Larks chaunt round our Heads  How soft the western Winds sigh thro' the Reeds  Peg  The scented Meadows Birds and healthy Breeze  For ought I know may more than  Peggy  please  Pat  You wrong me Fair to doubt my being kind  In speaking so you call me Dull and Blind  Thy Breath is sweeter than the sweetest Brier  Thy Cheek and Breast the finest Flow'rs appear  Thy Words excel the most delightful Notes  That warble thro' the Nightingale's soft Throats  The sweetest Fruits that hang upon the Tree  Are far inferior to a Kiss of thee  Peg  I feel your Pow'r nor dare I listen long  Unless you swear never to do me Wrong  Pat  Sooner a Mother shall her Fondness drap  And wrong the Child sits smiling on her Lap  The Sun shall change the Moon to change shall cease  The Goats to climb the Sheep to yield their Fleece  E're Infidelity in me you prove  No Power on Earth can shake my constant Love  AIR X Auld  Rob Morris  Peg  When first my dear  Patie  went to the Green Hill  And I at Ewemilking first try'd my young Skill  The Toil of the Day no Pain was to me  So at Close of the Ev'ning I met but with thee  Pat  When the Corn it wav'd yellow the fair flow'ry Field  If my  Peggy  was absent no Pleasure cou'd yield  But Bryers and Thorns gave no Trouble to me  If I found the Berries right ripen'd for thee  Peg  When you Ran or Wrestled or pleasingly Danc'd  And came off the Victor my Heart was entranc'd  Thy each manly Sport gave Pleasure to me  For none can Dance Wrestle or Run swift as thee  Pat  Young  Jenny  sings softly the  Cowden Broom knows    And  Kitty  sings briskly the  Milking the Ewes    There's few  Jenny Nettles  like  Nancy  can sing  With  Thro' the Wood Laddie    Bess  makes our Ears ring  But when my dear  Peggy  sings with better Skill  The  Boatman    Tweedside  or  The Lass of the Mill    'Tis many times sweeter and pleasing to me  For tho' they sing nicely they sing not like thee  Peg  How soon we believe whate'er we desire  And Praise from our Lovers increases Love's Fire  Give me still this Pleasure my Study shall be  To make my self better and sweeter for thee  AIR XI As  Jockey  and  Jenny  c  Peg  You need not to pull me

all  I've seen with shining Fair the Morning Rise  And soon a low'ring Cloud dark all the Skies  I've seen the Silver Spring awhile run clear  And soon in Mossey Puddles disappear  The Bridegroom may rejoice the Bride may smile  But soon Contentions all their Joys beguile  Rog  I've seen the Morning rise with fairest Light  The Day unclouded sink in calmest Night  I've seen the Spring run winding
