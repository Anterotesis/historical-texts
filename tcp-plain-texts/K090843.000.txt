 SIR HENRY LEE Kn  t    portrait of Sir Henry Lee  OF LONDON  DOMINE DIRIGE NOS  LONDON Printed for ROB  T  FAULDER N  o  New Bond Street MDCCXC  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS work is composed from the observations of perhaps half my life made without the lest original view of publication from the numberless walks taken in and about our capital with a mind occupied with more ideas than the frivolous visit or the mere object of the hour  SOME were made in company of different friends stricken like myself with the love of the science of antiquities and with the desire of tracing the progress of perhaps the first city comparing all its advantages in the universe  THE remarks made in these latter walks  were committed to my tablets till they became rather considerable In that state I determined to lay them before the public not urged by  desire  of friends nor the  wish  of the people or any similar motives but by my own continued propensity to writing  I HAVE two things to apologize for in this performance First its irregularity but I do assure my friends it is given nearly in the same manner in which the materials were collected and quite according to the course of the walk of the day  Secondly Let me request the good inhabitants of  London  and  Westminster  not to be offended at my having stuffed their  Iliad  into a nutshell the account of the city of  London  and liberties of  Westminster  into a  quarto  volume I have condensed into it all I could omitted nothing that suggested itself nor amplified  any thing  to make it a guinea book  In a word it is done in my own manner from which I am grown too old to depart  I FEEL within myself a certain monitor that warns me to hang up my pen in time before its powers are weakened and rendered visibly impaired I wait not for the admonition of friends I have the archbishop of  Grenada  in my eye and fear the imbecility of human nature might produce in longworn age the same treatment of my kind advisers as poor  Gil Blas  had from his most reverend patron My literary bequests to future times and more serious concerns must occupy the remnant of my days This closes my public labors  To every particular friend and correspondent I send my most cordial thanks for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enquiries and for their bearing so long with my  yearning after information and with my uncommon curiosity without which no writer can proceed with the confidence of accuracy or ought to lay any thing before the public unsanctioned by local information So much for acknowlegement of private favorsI take leave of a partial public with the truest gratitude for its long endurance of my very voluminous writings for its kind fostering my few merits for its affected blindness to my numerous defects The last act concluded  Valete et Plaudite THOMAS PENNANT  Downing  March  INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BOOKBINDER  Frontispiece SIR HENRY LEE see p  Page ROBERT DUDLEY Earl of

found an impulse towards civilization  ESTABLISHMENT OF A BRITISH TOWN  to withdraw from their native dens in depth of woods and to form society they cleared a spot in the midst of their forests and founded their towns similar to those which the first discoverers of the new world met with occupied by the savages of  America  De Brie's Virginia  tab xix xx  similar to but probably inferior in oeconomy to those of the more polished race of  Pholey Negroes  Moore's  Travels into  Africa    of  Guinea  The  Britons  soon found the danger of living in families separated and undefended They sought for security in places surrounded with woods or morasses and added to the natural strength by forming ramparts and sinking fosses  Oppidum autem  Britanni  vocant quum sylvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt  Caesar de Bel Gal  lib vLocum egregiè et naturâ et opere munitum  Ibid Strabo  lib iv p  But they preferred spots fortified by nature and made artificial works only where  nature shewed herself deficient Within such precincts they formed their towns their buildings were most mean and simple covered with reeds or sticks like  American  wigwams or like modern hovels of the peasants of  Lo  haber  or the cabins of the  Irish  commonalty to this moment as rude as the  British  aborigines To these precincts the  Britons  resorted with their cattle their wives and children  Dioderus Siculus  lib v c  whom they left thus protected while they sallied out to war or to the employments of the chace for their cloathing was the skins of beasts and their food the flesh with the addition of milk and farinaceous diet The  Britons  soon became acquainted with one great use of the cow notwithstanding they remained ignorant of the making of cheese till the arrival of the  Romans  Agriculture was soon introduced among those who earliest formed towns or communities possibly by strangers who visited them from the continent They cleared the land in the neighborhood of their dwellings they sowed corn they reaped and deposited it in granaries under ground as the  Sicilians  practise to this very day but the latter lodged it in the grain our predecessors in the ear out of which they picked the grains as they wanted them and ignorant of mills at first bruised and then made them into a coarse bread  Conjuges et liberos in loca tuta transferrent  Tacitus in vit Agric  The same nation who taught them the art of agriculture first introduced a change of dress From the  Gauls  of the continent they received the first cloth the dress called the  Bracha  a coarse woollen manufacture But probably it was long before they learned the use of the loom or became their own manufacturers This intercourse  layed the foundation of commerce which in early times extended no farther than to our maritime places  They  first received the rudiments of civilization while the more remote remained in proportion to their distance more and more savage or in a state of nature In the same degree as the neighboring  Gauls  became acquainted with the arts they communicated them to the nearest  British  colonists who derived from the same stock and retaining the same language and manners were more capable and willing to receive any instructions offered by a congenerous people For this reason  Cantium  the modern  Kent  and probably the country for some way up the  Thames  was as  Caesar  informs us far the most civilized of any part of  Britain  and that the inhabitants differed very little in their manner of life from the  Gauls  It was from the merchants who frequented our ports he received the first intelligence of the nature of our country which induced him to undertake the invasion of  Britain  and which in aftertimes layed the foundation of its conquest by the  Romans  THERE is not the lest reason to doubt but that  London  existed at that period and was a place of much resort  LONDON  It stood in such a situation as the  Britons  would select according to the rule they established An immense forest originally extended to the river side and even as late as the reign of  Henry  II covered the northern neighborhood of the city and was filled with various species of beasts of chace  Fitzstephen's Descr London    It was defended naturally by fosses one formed by the creek which ran along  Fleetditch  the other afterwards known by that of  Walbrook  The south side was  guarded by the  Thames  The north they might think sufficiently protected by the adjacent forest  LONDON STONE  NEAR  St Swithin's  church is a remnant of antiquity which some have supposed to have been  British  a stone which might have formed a part of a  Druidical  circle or some other object of the antient religion as it is placed near the center of the  Roman  precincts Others have conjectured it to have been a milliary stone and to have served as a standard from which they began to compute their miles This seems very reasonable as the distances from the neighboring places coincide very exactly At all times it has been preserved with great care was placed deep in the ground and strongly fastened with bars of iron It seems preserved like the  Palladium  of the city It is at present cased like a relique within freestone with a hole left in the middle which discovers the original Certainly superstitious respect had been payed to it for when the notorious rebel  Jack Cade  passed by it after he had forced his way into the city he struck his sword on  London stone  saying "Now is  Mortimer  lord of this citie  Holinshed    " as if that had been a customary ceremony of taking possession  WHEN FOUNDED  THERE is every reason to suppose that the  Romans  possessed themselves of  London  in the reign of  Claudius  under whom  Aulus Plautius  took  Camalcdunum  the present  Maldon  in  Essex  and planted there a colony consisting of veterans of the fourteenth legion about a hundred and five years after the first invasion of our island by  Caesar  This was the first footing the  Romans  had in  Britain  It seems certain that  London  and  Verulam  were taken possession of about the same time but the last clames the honor of being of a far earlier date more opulent populous and a royal seat before the conquest of  Britain Camalodunum  was made a  Colonia  or a place governed entirely by  Roman  laws and customs  Verulamium  a  Municipium  in which the natives were honored with the privileges of  Roman  citizens and enjoyed their own laws and constitutions and  Londinium  ONLY A PRAEFECTURA  only a  Praefectura  the inhabitants a mixture of  Romans  and  Britons  being suffered to enjoy no more than the name of citizens of  Rome  being governed by  Praefects  sent annually from thence without having either their own laws or magistrates It was even then of such concourse and such vast trade that the wise conquerors did not think fit to trust the inhabitants with the same privileges as other places of which they had less reason to be jealous  THERE is no mention of this important place till the reign of  Tiberius  when  Tacitus  speaks of it as not having been distinguished as a colony but famous for its great concourse of merchants and its vast commerce this indicates at lest that  London  had been at that time of some antiquity as a trading town The exports from hence were cattle hides and corn dogs made a small article and let me add that slaves were a considerable object Our internal parts were on a level with the  African  slave coasts and wars among the petty monarchs were promoted for the sake of a traffic now so strongly controverted  Strabo  lib iv p  The imports were at first salt earthen ware and works in brass  IMPORTS  polished bits of bones emulating ivory horsecollars toys of amber and glasses and other articles of the same material  The same p  We  need not insist on the commerce of this period for there was a great trade carried on with the  Gauls  in the days of  Caesar  that celebrated invader assigning as his reason for attempting this island the vast supplies which we gave to his  Gaulish  enemies  Bell Gall  lib iv  and which interrupted his conquests on the continent  WHEN FIRST MENTIONED  THE first mention of  London  was occasioned by a calamity in the year in the reign of  Nero  which nearly occasioned the extinction of the  Roman  power in  Britain  The heroine  Boadicia  indignant at the personal insult offered to her and her family and the cruelties of the conquerors to the unhappy  Britons  made a sudden revolt and destroyed  Camolodunum  after putting all the colonists to the sword  Tacitus  gives us the prediction of the ruin of that city with all the majesty of historical superstition  Nulla palàm causa delapsum  Camaloduni  simulacrum victoriae ac retro conversum quasi cederet hostibus Et foeminae in furore turbatae adesse exitium canebant Externosque fremitus in curiâ eorum auditos consonuisse ululatibus theatrum visamque speciem in aestuario notam esse subversae coloniae Jam oceanum cruento aspectu dilabente aestu humanorum corporum effigies relictas ut  BRITANNI  ad spem ita veterani ad metum trahebant  Annales  lib xiv c    THE  Roman  general  Paulinus Suetonius  on this news suddenly marched across the kingdom from his conquests in  North Wales  to  London  which finding himself unequal to defend with his small army he evacuated to the fury of the enemy after reinforcing his troops with all the natives who were fit to serve Neither the tears nor prayers of the inhabitants could prevale on  him to give them his protection  DESTROYED BY THE BRITON  The enraged  Boadicia  destroyed all who continued behind  Verulamium  met with the same fate In all the three places seventy thousand  Romans  and  British  allies perished  Tac Annales  lib xiv c    WHEN the  Romans  became masters of  London  ENLARGED BY THE ROMANS  they enlarged the precincts and altered their form It extended in length from  Ludgatehill  to a spot a little beyond the  Tower  The breadth was not half equal to the length and at each end grew considerably narrower Mr  Maitland  suspects that the walls were not built till a very late period of the empire and that it was an open town because the city happened to be surprized  LONG AN OPEN TOWN  in the days of  Dioclesian  and  Maximilian  by a party of banditti who were cut off by a band of  Roman  soldiers who fortunately had at the very time they were engaged in the plunder come up the river in a fog The time in which the wall was built is very uncertain Some ascribe the work to  Constantine  the great  WHEN WALLED  Maitland  to  Theodosius  governor of  Britain  in As to the last we know no more than that after he had cleared the country of the barbarians he redressed grievances strengthened the garrisons and repaired the cities and forts  Ammianus Marcellinus  lib xxviii c  which had been damaged If  London  was among those it certainly implies a prior fortification Possibly their founder might have been  Constantine  as numbers of coins of his mother  Helena  have been discovered under them placed there by him in compliment to her To support this conjecture we may strengthen it by saying that in honor of this empress the city about that time  received from her the title of  Augusta  which for some time superseded the antient one of  Londinium  Long before this period it was fully  romanized  and the customs manners buildings and arts of the conqueror adopted The commerce of the empire flowed in regularly came in a direct channel from the several parts then known not as in the earlier days when described by  Strabo  by the intervention of other nations for till the settlement of the  Roman  conquest nothing could come immediately from  Italy  The antient course of the walls was as followsIt began with a fort near the present site of the  Tower  EXTENT AND FORM  was continued along the  Minories  and the back of  Houndsditch  across  Bishopsgate street  in a strait line by  Londonwall  to  Cripplegate  then returned southward by  Crowder's Well Alley  where several remnants of lofty towers were lately to be seen to  Aldersgate  thence along the back of  Bull and Mouth street  to  Newgate  and again along the back of the houses in the  Old Bailey  to  Ludgate  soon after which it probably finished with another fort where the house late the King's Printing House in  Black Friars  now stands from hence another wall ran near the riverside along  Thames street  quite to the fort on the eastern extremity In another place I shall have occasion to mention that the river at present is moved considerably more to the south than it was in the times in question  TOWERS  THE walls were three miles a hundred and sixtyfive feet in circumference guarded at proper distances on the land side with fifteen lofty towers some of them were remaining within these few years and possibly may still  Maitland  mentions one twentysix feet high near  Gravellane  on the west side of  Houndsditch  another about eighty paces southeast towards  Aldgate  and the  bases of another supporting a modern house at the lower end of the street called the  Vineyard  south of  Aldgate  But since his publication they have been demolished so that there is not a trace left The walls when perfect are supposed to have been twentytwo feet high the towers forty These with the remnants of the wall proved the  Roman  structure by the tiles and disposition of the masonry  Londonwall  near  Moorfields  is now the most entire part left of that ancient precinct  I MUST not omit the  Barbican  A SPECULA  the  Specula  or  Watchtower  belonging to every fortified place This stood a little without the walls to the northwest of  Cripplegate  THE gates which received the great military roads were four  THE GATES  The  Praetorian  way the  Saxon Watling street  passed under one on the site of the late  Newgate  vestiges having been discovered of the road in digging above  Holbornbridge  it turned down to  Dow  gate or more properly  Dwr  gate or  Water  gate where there was a  Trajectus  or  Ferry  to join it to the  Watling street  which was continued to  Dover  The  Hermin street  passed under  Cripplegate  and a vicinal way went under  Aldgate  by  Bethnal Green  towards  Oldford  a pass over the river  Lee  to  Duroleiton  the modern  Leiton  in  Essex  IN most parts of antient  London  ANTIQUITIES  Roman  antiquities have been found whenever it has been thought necessary to dig to any considerable depth Beneath the old  Saint Mary le Bow  were found the walls windows and pavement of a  Roman Temple  and not far from it eighteen feet deep in adventitious soil was the  Roman  causeway The great elevation of the present ground above its former state will be taken notice of in another place  IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of  St Paul's  was found a vast coemetery first lay the  Saxons  in graves lined with chalkstones or in coffins of hollowed stones beneath them had been the bodies of the  Britons  placed in rows Abundance of ivory and boxen pins about six inches long marked their place These were supposed to have fastened the shrouds in which the bodies were wrapped  Parentalia  p  These perishing left the pins entire In the same row but deeper were  Roman  urns intermixed lamps lacrymatories fragments of sacrificial vessels were also discovered in digging towards the northeast corner and in not far from the east corner at a considerable depth beneath some flinty pavement were found numbers of vessels of earthen ware and of glass of most exquisite colors and beauty some inscribed with the names of deities heroes or men of rank Others ornamented with variety of figures in bas relief of animals and of rosetrees  Tesulae  of jasper porphyry or marble such as form the pavement we so often see were also discovered Also glass beads and rings large pins of ivory and bone tusks of boars and horns of deer sawn through Also coins of different emperors among them some of  Constantine  which at once destroys the conjecture of Mr  Maitland  who supposes that this collection were flung together at the sacking of  London  by our injured  Boadicia  IN another coemetery was discovered in  Camomile street  adjoining to  Bishopsgate  It lay beneath a handsome tesselated pavement and contained numbers of urns filled with ashes and cinders of burnt bones with them were beads rings a lacrymatory a fibula and a coin of  Antoninus  IN SPITTLEFIELDS  IN  Spittlefields  was another  Roman  buryingplace of which  many curious particulars are mentioned by old  Stow  in p of his Survey of  London  and  Camden  gives a brief account of another discovered in  Goodman's fields  Among those sound in  Spittlefields  was a great ossuary made of glass encompassed with five parallel circles and containing a gallon and a half it had a handle a very short neck and wide mouth of a whiter metal This was presented to Sir  Christopher Wren  who lodged it in the  Museum  of the Royal Society  Parentalia  p  Grew's Museum    I point out these as means of discovering the antient  Roman  precincts of the city The coemeteries must have been without the walls it being a wise and express law of the XII tables  that no one should be buried within the walls  I cannot think that the urns found near  St Paul's  were funebrial if that should have been the case the  Roman  walls must have been much farther to the east than they have been placed which by no means appears to have been the fact  I WILL only mention two other antiquities found here very few indeed have been preserved out of the multitude which must have been found in a place of such importance and the capital of the  Roman  empire in  Britain  The first is a sepulchral monument in memory of  Vivins Marcianus  a  Roman  soldier of the second legion quartered here erected by his wife  Januaria Matrina  His sculpture represents him as a  British  soldier probably of the  Cohors Britonum  dressed and armed after the manner of the country with long hair a short lower garment fastened round the waist by a girdle and fibula a long  Sagum  or plaid flung over his breast and one arm ready to be cast off in time of action naked legs and in his right hand a sword of vast length  like the  lymore  of the later  Highlanders  the point is represented resting on the ground in his left hand is a short instrument with the end seemingly broken off This sculpture was found in digging among the ruins after the fire in  in the  vallum  of the  Pr  t  ion  camp near  L  dgate  The soldiers were always buried in the  ll    the citizens in the  Pe  rium  Parentalia  p The  P  m  erium  was a space on the outside of fortified towns on which all buildings were prohibited  without the gates It is very differently represented by Mr  Gale  The hair in his figure is short the sword also short and held with the left hand across his body the instrument is placed in the left hand and resembles an exact  Bet    the  ss also differs I give the preference to the figure given by Mr  Hers  ly  Gale's Iter Anton    Britannia Romana  tab  which he corrected after the figure given by Doctor  Prid  x  from the  Arundelian  marbles But Mr  H  sely  fairly confesses that the representation is far more elegant than in the mutilated original  SAXON INVATION  AFTER the  Romans  deserted  Britain  a new and fierce race succeeded The warlike  Saxons  under their leaders  Hengest  and  Horsa  landed in at  Upwines fleot  the present  Ebbsflete  in the isle of  Thanet  The  Britons  remained masters of  London  at lest nine years after that event for receiving a defeat in at  Creccanford Crayford  they evacuated  Kent  and fled with great fear to the capital  Sax Chron  By the year it seems to have recovered from the ravages of the invaders It became the chief town of the kingdom of  Essex Sebert  was the first Christian king and his maternal uncle  Ethelbert  king of  Kent  founded here a church dedicated to  St Paul  At this time  Bede  informs us  that it was an  emporium  of a vast number of nations who resorted there by sea and by land  IN the reign of that great prince ALFRED  London  or to use the  Saxon  name  Lundenburg  was made by him capital of all  England  In consequence of a vow he had made he sent  Sighelm  bishop of  Sherbourn  first to  Rome  and from thence to  India  with alms to the Christians of the town of  St Thomas  now called  Bekkeri  or  Meliapour  who returned with various rich gems some of which were to be seen in the church of  Sherbourn  in the days of  William  of  Malmesbury  Sax Chron    Wil Mel  sh  lib ii  It must not be omitted that he was the first who from this island had any commerce with that distant country Our commerce by sea even in the next century was not very extensive the wise monarch  Athelstan  being obliged for the encouragement of navigation to promise patents of gentility to every merchant who should on his own bottom make three voyages to the  Mediterranean  THE succeeding ravages of the  Danes  reduced  London  NORMAN CONQUEST  and its commerce to a low ebb yet it seems in some measure to have recovered itself before the Conquest We are wonderfully in the dark respecting its state of government both in the  Saxon  period and that of the Conquest in respect to the former we know no more than that it was governed by a  Portreve  or  Portgrave  LONG GOVERNED BY A PORTGRAVE  or guardian of the port and this we learn from the concise charter granted to the city by  William  the Conqueror in which he salutes  William  the bishop and  Godfrey  the  Portreve  and all the burgesses  WILLM̄ kyng griet  Willm̄  bisshop and  Godfreg'  porteren and eall the boroughwaren bynnen  London  franchisce and englisce  jich kyd eth y  r  jck yell y  r  gret bē ealbra

behelde  Customs of  London  p    It is probable that the bishop of  London  for the time being and the  Portgrave  were united in the government for in the  Saxon  charters they are mentioned together in the time of  Edward  the Confessor  Alswar  the bishop and  Wolfgar  my  Portgrave William  bishop and  Swerman  my  Portgrave  LONDON certainly could not have been in the very low condition which some writers represent it to have been at the time of the Conquest It had ventured to sally out on the Conqueror but without success It fell more by internal faction than its own weakness yet there was strength enough left to make  William  think proper to secure their allegiance by building that strong fortress the  Tower  In seventy years from that event an historian  Fitzstephen  of that period pretends that  London  mustered sixty thousand foot and twenty thousand horse If this is any thing near the truth is it possible but  London  must have been very powerful at the time of the Conquest for the reigns between that period and of  Stephen  were not well calculated for a great increase of population I rather concur with them who think that the muster must have been of the militia of the neighboring counties and  London  the place of rendezvous A writer  Peter de Blois  archdeacon of  London  See  Fitzstephen  p in the note  of that period and at the very time resident in the capital with  more appearance of truth makes the number of inhabitants only forty thousand  DURING the time of the Conqueror and till the reign of  Richard  I the name of the civil governor continued the same That monarch to support the madness of the  crusade  received from the citizens a large sum of money and in return permitted them to chuse annually two officers under the name of bailiffs or sheriffs who were to supersede the former The names of the two first upon record are  Wolgarius  and  Geffry de Magnum  IN the next reign was added the office of mayor  CHANGED TO A MAYOR  a title borrowed from the  Norman Maire  as well as the office  Henry Fitzalwyn  was the first elected  o that trust He had been before mayor but only by the nomination of his prince  IN the reign of  Henry  III after the citizens had suffered many oppressions he restored a form of government and appointed twentyfour citizens to share the power In his son's reign we find the city divided into twentyfour wards the supreme magistrate of which was named  Alderman  ALDERMEN  an exceeding antient  Saxon  title  Aelderman  a man advanced in years and accordingly supposed to be of superior wisdom and gravity In the time of  Edgar  the office was among the first in the kingdom  Ailwyn  ancestor to the first mayor was alderman of all  England  what the duties of his office were does not appear  HE must be a  Briarcus  in literature who would dare to attempt a history of our capital on the great the liberal the elegant plan which it merits I a puny adventurer animated with a mind incapable of admitting a vacant hour restless when unemployed in the rural scenes to which my fortunate lot has destined me must catch and enjoy the idea of the minute In the  pursuit of my plan I wish to give a slight view of the shores I am about to launch from the account must be brief and confined limited to what I shall say of their antient state to the period bounded by the REVOLUTION intermixed with the greater events which have happened in nearer days  THE choice of the situation of this great city was most judicious It is on a gravelly soil and on a declivity down to the borders of a magnificent river The slope is evident in every part of the antient city and the vast modern buildings The antient city was defended in front by the river on the west side by the deep ravine since known by the name of  Fleetditch  on the north by morasses on the east as I suspect by another ravine All the land round  Westminster Abbey  was a flat sen which continued beyond  Fulham  but a rise commences opposite to it and forms a magnificent bend above the curvature of the  Thames  even to the  Tower  The  Surry  side was in all probability a great expanse of water a lake a  Llyn  as the  Welsh  call it which an ingenious countryman of mine  Mr  William Owen  of  Barmouth  now resident in  London  not without reason thinks might have given a name to our capital  Llyn Din  or the city on the lake This most probably was the original name and that derived from  Llong  a ship and  Din  a town might have been bestowed when the place became a seat of trade and famous for the concourse of shipping The expanse of water might have filled the space between the rising grounds at  Deptfor  and those at  Clapham  and been bounded to the south by the beautiful  Surry Hills Lambeth Marsh  and the  Bank Side  evidently were recovered from the water Along  Lambeth  are the names of  Narrow  Walls  or the mounds which served for that purpose and in  Southwark Bankside  again shews the means of converting the antient lake into useful land even to this day the tract beyond  Southwark  and in particular that beyond  Bermondsey street  is so very low and beneath the level of common tides that the proprietors are obliged to secure it by embankments  I BEGIN my account by crossing over the  Thames  into  Surry  SURRY  which with  Sussex  formed the country of the antient  Regni  being part of this island to which the  Romans  permitted a kingly government merely to enjoy the insolent boast of having kings as their slaves The  Saxons  bestowed on this part their own names of  Suthry  or  Suthrea  from its situation on the southern part of the river I proceed to my accustomed walk of LAMBETH  LAMBETH  In the earlier times it was a manor possibly a royal one for the great  Hardiknut  died here in in the midst of the jollity of a wedding dinner and here without any formality the usurper  Harold  is said to have snatched the crown and placed it on his own head At that period it was part of the estate of  Goda  wife to  Walter  earl of  Mantes  and  Eustace  earl of  Boulogne  who presented it to the church of  Rochester  but reserved to herself the patronage of the church It became in the property of the see of  Canterbury  by exchange transacted between  Glanville  bishop of  Rochester  and the archbishop  Hubert Walter Glanville  reserved out of the exchange a small piece of land on which he built a house called  Rochester Place  for the reception of the bishops of  Rochester  whenever they came to attend parlement In  John de Shepey  built  Stangate stairs  for the convenience of himself and retinue to cross over into  Westminster Fisher  and  Hilsley  were the last bishops who inhabited this palace after their deaths it fell into the hands of  Henry  VIII who exchanged with  Aldridge  bishop of  Carliste  for certain houses in the  Strand  Its name was changed to that of  Carlisle house  Ducarel's Lambeth    The small houses built on its site still belong to that see It had been the design of archbishop  Walter  A COLLEGE OF SECULAR MONKS PROJECTED HERE  to have erected here a college of secular monks independent of those of  Canterbury  It was originally designed by archbishop  Baldwyn  to have been built at  Hackington  near that city but such a jealousy did those holy men conceive at the thought of a rival house so near to their own that by their interest with the pope the project was layed aside It was afterwards resumed by  Hubert Walter  who thought he could give no offence by erecting the college on this distant manor but the monks obtaining a bull from the pope in their favor and such humiliating terms prescribed to the archbishop that from thenceforth he entirely desisted from the design    The mortifications which the primates met with in the prosecution seem to have first determined them in fixing their residence here  Walter  and  Langton  successively lived at the manorhouse of  Lambeth  The last improved it but the building was afterwards neglected and became ruinous No pious zeal restored the place but the madness of priestly pride  Boniface  a wrathful and turbulent primate elected in took it into his head to become a visitor of the priory of  St Bartholomew  to which he had no right The monks met him with reverential respect but assured him the office did not belong to the bishop The meek prelate rushed on the subprior knocked him down  kicked beat and buffeted him tore the cope off his back and stamped on it like one possessed while his attendants payed the same compliments to all the poor monks The people enraged at his unpriestly conduct would have torn him to pieces when he retired to  Lambeth  and by way of expiation rebuilt it with great magnificence  THIS palace was very highly improved by the munificent  Henry Chichely  who enjoyed the primacy from to I lament to find so worthy a man to have been the founder of a building so reproachful to his memory as the  Lollards  tower at the expence of near two hundred and eighty pounds Neither protestants or catholics should omit visiting this tower the cruel prison of the unhappy followers of  Wickliffe  The vast staples and rings to which they were chained before they were brought to the stake ought to make protestants bless the hour which freed them from so bloody a religion Catholics may glory that time has softened their zeal into charity for all sects and made them blush at these memorials of the misguided zeal of our ancestors  THIS palace suffered greatly in the civil wars After those of  York  and  Lancaster  it was restored by archbishop  Morton  He also built the gateway in the lower room of which are still to be seen the rings to which the overflowings of the  Lollards  tower were chained  AFTER the civil wars of the last century  FANATICAL FURY  when fanatical was united with political fury it was found that every building devoted to piety had suffered more than they had done in all the rage of family contest The fine works of art and the sacred memorials of the dead were except in a few cases sacrificed to  puritanical barbarism or to sacrilegious plunder  Lambeth  tell to the share of the miscreant regicide  Scot  He turned the chapel into a hall and levelled for that purpose the fine monument of archbishop  Parker  he pulled down the noble hall the work of  Chichely  and sold the materials for his own profit  Juxon  on the Restoration found the palace of his predecessors a heap of ruins His piety rebuilt a greater part than could have been expected from the short time he enjoyed the primacy He rebuilt the great hall on the antient model when the archbishop with his particular friends sat at the high table the steward with the servants who were gentry of the better rank sat at the table on the right hand side the almoner the clergy and others occupied the table on the left None but nobility or privy counsellors were admitted to the table of the archbishop The bishops themselves sat at the almoner's the other guests at the steward's All the meat which was not consumed was regularly given to the idle poor who waited in crowds at the gate It is not the defect of charity in modern prelates that this custom is difused but the happy change in the times Every one must now eat the bread of his own industry a much more certain support than the casual bounty of the great which misfortunes often prevented and left the object a prey to misery and famine What is styled the luxury of the times has by no means superseded deeds of alms Wealth is more equally diffused but charity is equally great it passes now through many channels and makes less noise than when it was poured through fewer streams  LIBRARY  THE fine library in this palace was founded by archbishop  Bancroft  who died in and left all his books to his successors for ever The succeeding archbishop  Abbot  bequeathed all his  books in his great study marked C C in the same unlimited manner  ON the suppression of episcopacy this valuable library was preserved by the address of the celebrated Mr  Selden  It seems that archbishop  Bancroft  had left his books to his successors on condition that the immediate successor was to give bond that they should not be embezzled but delivered entire from one to the other for ever On failure of this article they were to go to  Chelsea College  in case it was built in six years after his decease The college never was finished but whether any of  Bancroft  's successors gave the security does not appear The books were remaining at  Lambeth  in two years after the execution of archbishop  Laud  when probably fearing for their safety in times so inimical to learning Mr  Selden  suggested to the university of  Cambridge  their right to the books and the whole were delivered into their possession On the Restoration archbishop  Juxon  demanded the return of the library which was repeated by his successor  Sheldon  as founded on the will of the pious founder and they were restored accordingly Archbishop  Sheldon  added a considerable number and archbishop  Tenison  augmented it with part of his books  THAT very worthy prelate archbishop  Secker  besides a considerable sum expended on making catalogues to the old registers of the see left to the library all such books from his own as were not in the former which comprehended much the largest and most valuable part of his own collection  ARCHBISHOP  Cornwallis  bestowed many valuable books in his lifetime And the present archbishop has given a considerable sum for fitting up a proper repository for the valuable collection  of manuscripts The whole number of printed books amounts to twentyfive thousand  THE other apartments have within these few years received considerable improvements  G  S  The great gallery which is near ninety feet long by fifteen feet nine inches broad has lately had the addition of a bow window by the present amiable primate An opening has been made towards the river by the cutting down of a few trees which admits a most beautiful view of the water part of the bridge and of the venerable abbey This gallery is filled with portraits of primates or prelates among others that of cardinal  Pole  the founder of this very room Over the chimney are the heads of those of the earlier times such as archbishop  Warham  by  Holbein St Dunstan  and archbishop  Chichely  the first imaginary the last probably taken from painted glass Among these distinguished characters  Katherine Parr  has found a place and not without just clame it being reasonable to suppose but for the death of her tyrant she would have been devoted to the stake for the favor she bore to the reformed religion I must not omit mention of the two portraits of archbishop  Parker  second primate of the protestant religion one is by  Holbein  the other by  Richard Lyne  who jointly practised the arts of painting and engraving in the service of this great patron of science  Granger  i    IN the diningroom is a succession of primates from the violent and imprudent  Laud  to the quiet and discreet  Cornwallis  The portrait of  Laud  is admirably done by  Vandyke Juxon  from a good original which I saw last year at  Longleate Tenison  by  Simon Dubois Herring  by  Hogarth Hutton  by  Hudson Secker  by  Reynolds  and  Cornwallis  by  Dance  Here are besides in the gallery by the last master portraits of  Terrick  late bishop of  London  and  Thomas  late bishop of  Winchester  and another of bishop  Hoadley  which does honor to the artist his wife  Sarah Curtis  When I looked into the garden I could not but recall the scene of conference between the great the wise earl of  Clarendon  and the unfortunate  Laud Hyde  laid before him the resentment of all ranks of people against him for his passionate and illmannered treatment even of persons of rank The primate attended to the honest chancellor with patience and palliated his faults  Life of  Edward  earl of  Clarendon  octavo ed i  The advice was forgotten nor his folly cured till he had involved himself and master in destruction  A MORE phlegmatic cohabitant of the garden  LONGEVITY OF A TORTOISE  enjoyed his situation during many successions to this selfdevoted metropolitan A  Tortoise  introduced here in his days in lived till the year the time of archbishop  Herring  and possibly might have lived till the present had it not been killed by the negligence of the gardener  IN the vestry is a portrait of  Luther  and his wife the lady appears pregnant This great reformer left three sons  John Martin  and  Paul  IN one of the apartments of the palace is a performance that does great honor to the ingenious spouse of a modern dignitary a copy in needlework of a  Madonna  and child after a most capital performance of the  Spanish Murillo  There is most admirable grace in the original which was sold last winter at the price of eight hundred guineas  In Mr  Vandergucht  's sale  It made me lament that this excellent master  had wasted so much time on beggars and ragged boys Beautiful as it is the copy came improved out of the hand of our skilful countrywoman a judicious change of color of part of the drapery has had a most happy effect and given new excellence to the admired original  CHURCH  THE parish church of  Lambeth  is at a small distance from the palace has a plain tower and the architecture of the gothic of the time of  Edward  IV It has very little remarkable in it except the figure of a pedlar and his dog painted in one of the windows Tradition says that the parish was obliged to this man for the bequest of a piece of land which bears the name of  The Pedlar's Acre  BEFORE I go any farther let me mention the sad example of fallen majesty in the person of  Mary d'Este  the unhappy queen of  James  II who flying with her infant prince from the ruin impending over their house after crossing the  Thames  from the abdicated  Whitehall  took shelter beneath the antient walls of this church a whole hour from the rain of the inclement night of  December  th Here she waited with aggravated misery till a common coach procured from the next inn arrived and conveyed her to  Gravesend  from whence she sailed and bid an eternal adieu to these kingdoms  Rapin  d ed folio ii    IN this place rest from their labors several of the later primates without any remarkable monument except their good works to preserve them from oblivion among them is  Bancroft Tenison Hutton  and in a passage leading to the palace are the remains of  Secker  HERE likewise was interred the mild amiable  BISHOP TUNSTAL  and polished prelate  Cuthbert Tunstal  bishop of  Durham  who deprived on account of his attachment to the old religion by  Edward  VI was restored by  Mary  and again deprived by  Elizabeth  here he found an asylum in the family of archbishop  Parker  so highly was he esteemed even by the protestants here he passed his days with honor and tranquillity till his death in  IN the same church are the remains of  Thirlebye  BISHOP THIRLEBYE  once bishop of  Ely  deprived for the same cause by  Elizabeth  By the charity of the abovementioned great prelate he found the same protection as his fellowsufferer  Tunstal  To shew the humanity of protestantism he was indulged with the company of his secretary He merited every favor Being joined in commission with  Bonner  for the degradation of  Cranmer  he performed his office with as much tenderness as his associate did with brutality and melted into tears over fallen greatness His body was found in digging the grave for archbishop  Cornwallis  His long and venerable beard and every part was entire and of a beautiful whiteness a slouched hat was under his left arm his dress that of a pilgrim as he esteemed himself to be upon earth  A NEAT bust with the body in armour and with artillery  ROBERT SCOT  drums and trophies around exhibits the military character of  Robert Scot  who entered into the service of  Gustavus Adolphus  and brought with him two hundred men He was made mustermaster general to that hero afterwards he went into the service of  Denmark  and finally in closed his life in that of  Charles  I who made him gentleman of his privy chamber and bestowed on him a pension of six hundred a year He was of the family of the antient barons of  Bawtrie  in  North Britain  but  his character surpassed his origin  INVENTOR OF LEATHERN ARTILLERY  He was the inventor of leathern artillery which he introduced into the army of  Gustavus  and by that means contributed highly to the glorious victory of  Leipsic Harte  and other historians of that illustrious prince speak of the invention and its important services but were either ignorant of the inventor or chose to suppress his merit  Harte  's Hist  Gustavus Adelphus  d ed i ii    Tilly  himself confesses the superiority of these portable cannons after his own heavy artillery so admirably served as they were sunk under the vivacity of the fire of these light pieces  TOMB OF THE TRADESCANTS  IN the churchyard is a tomb which no naturalist should neglect visiting that of old  John Tradescant  who with his son lived in this parish The elder was the first person who ever formed a cabinet of curiosities in this kingdom The father is said to have been gardener to  Charles  I But  Parkinson  says  sometimes belonging to the right honorable lord  Robert  earl of  Salisbury  lord treasurer of  England  in his time and then unto the right honorable the lord  Wotton  at  Canterbury  in  Kent  and lastly unto the late duke of  Buckingham  Parkinson  's  Paradi  ur Terrestris      Both father and son were great travellers the father is supposed to have visited  Russia  and most parts of  Europe Turkey Greece  many of the eastern countries  Egypt  and  Barbary  out of which he introduced multitudes of plants and flowers unknown before in our gardens His was an age of florists the chief ornaments of the parterres were owing to his labors  Parkinson  continually acknowleges the obligation Many plants were called after his name these the  Linnaean  system has rendered almost obsolete but the great naturalist  hath made more than reparation by giving to a genus of plants the title of TRADESCANTIA  Species Plantarum  i    MUSEUM TRADESCANTIANUM  The  Museum Tradescantianum  a small book adorned by he hand of  Hollar  with the heads of the father and the son is a proof of their industry It is a catalogue of their vast collection not only of the subjects of the three kingdoms of nature but of artificial rarities from great variety of countries The collection of medals coins and other antiquities appears to have been very valuable Zoology was in their time but in a low state and credulity far from being extinguished among the eggs is one supposed to have been of the  dragon  and another of the  griffin  You might have found here two feathers of the tail of the  phoenix  and the claw of the  ruck  a bird able to  trusse an elephant  Notwithstanding this the collection was extremely valuable especially in the vegetable kingdom In his garden at his house in  South Lambeth  THEIR GARDEN  was an amazing arrangement of trees plants and flowers It seems to have been particularly rich in those of the east and of  North America  His merit and assiduity must have been very great for the eastern traveller must have labored under great difficulties from the barbarity of the country and  North America  had in his time been but recently settled Yet we find the names of numbers of trees and plants still among the rarer of much later times To him we are also indebted for the luxury of many fine fruits for as  Parkinson  observed  The choysest for goodnesse and rarest for knowledge are to be had of my very good friend Master  John Tradescante  who hath wonderly laboured to obtaine all the rarest fruits hee can heare off in any place of  Christendome  Turky  yea or the whole world  Parkinson  's  Paradisus Terrestris  p    He lived at a large house in this parish and had an extensive garden much visited in his days After his death which happened about the year his collection came into the possession of the famous Mr  Elias Ashmole  by virtue of a deed of gift which Mr  Tradescant  junior had made to him of all his rarities in true astrological form being dated  December    hor  minutes  post merid  Ashmole  's Diary  Mr  Ashmole  also purchased the house which is still in being the garden fell to decay In the year it was visited by two respectable members of the Royal Society  The late Sir  William Watson  and Doctor  Mitchel  See  Ph Trans  vol xlvi p  who found among the ruins some trees and plants which evidently were introduced here by the industrious founder The collection of curiosities were removed by Mr  Ashmole  to his  Museum  at  Oxford  where they are carefully preserved Many very curious articles are to be seen among others several original dresses and weapons of the  North Americans  in their original state which may in some period prove serviceable in illustrating their manners and antiquities  MONUMENT DESCRIBED  THE monument of the  Tradescants  was erected in by  Hester  relict of the younger It is an altar tomb at each corner is cut a large tree seeming to support the slab at one end is an  hydra  picking at a bare scull possibly designed as an emblem of Envy on the other end are the arms of the family on one side are ruins  Grecian  pillars and capitals an obelisk and pyramid to denote the extent of his travels and on the opposite a crocodile  and various shells expressive of his attention to the study of natural history Time had greatly injured this monument but in it was handsomely restored at the parish expence and the inscription which was originally designed for it engraven on the stone As it is both singular and historical I present it to the reader  Know stranger ere thou pass beneath this stone  Lye  John Tradescant  grandsire father son  The last dy'd in his spring the other two  Liv'd till they had

These famous Antiquarians that had been  Both gardiners to the Rose and Lily Queen  Transplanted now themselves sleep here and when  Angels shall with their trumpets waken men  And fire shall purge

ivv    IN contrast to these innocent characters  GUY FAUX  I shall mention that desperate miscreant  Guy Faux  or  Vauxe  as an inhabitant of this parish He lived in a large mansion called  Fauxhall  and as Doctor  Ducarel  imagines was lord of the manor of the same name In foreign parts a  colonne infame  would have been erected on the spot but the site is now occupied by  Marblehall  and  Cumberland  teagardens and several other buildings  FROM  Lambeth  I returned by the waterside near the end of  Westminster  bridge along a tract once a dreary marsh and still in parts called  Lambeth  marsh about the year there was not a house on it from  Lambeth  palace as far as  Southwark  Sir  William Dugdale  Dugdale  's embankments p  makes frequent mention of the works for securing it in old times by embankments or  walls  as they are styled to restrain the ravages of the tide The embankments in  Southwark  must have been the work of the  Romans  otherwise they never could have erected the buildings or made the roads of which such frequent vestiges have been found Most of this tract is become firm land and covered with most useful buildings even to the edge of the river  MRS COADE'S ARTIFICIAL STONE  In a street called  Narrow Wall  from one of the antient embankments is Mrs  Coade  's manufacture of artificial stone Her repository consists of several very large rooms filled with every ornament which can be used in architecture The statue the vase the urn the rich chimneypieces and in a few words every thing which could be produced out of natural stone or marble by the most elegant chisel is here to be obtained at an easy rate Proof has been made of its durable quality The inventor has been able to ward off the attacks of time but not of envy a beautiful font now the ornament of  Dibden  church in  Essex  and which was formed on a most admirable antique model was denied to the public eye in a place where liberality ought to have enjoyed the freest reign  ENGLISH WINES  NOTWITHSTANDING the climate of  Great Britain  has at lest of late years been unfavorable to the production of wines yet in the year we began to make some from the raisins or  dried grapes of  Spain  and  Portugal Francis Chamberlayne  made the attempt and obtained a patent for fourteen years in which it is alleged that his wines would keep good during several years and even in a voyage under the very line  Rymer  's  Foedera  xix  The art was most successfully revived several years ago by  Mark Beaufoy  and the foreign wines most admirably mimicked Such is the prodigality and luxury of the age that the demand for many sorts exceeds in a great degree the produce of the native vineyards We have skilful fabricators who kindly supply our wants It has been estimated that half of the port and fivesixths of the white wines consumed in our capital have been the produce of our home winepresses The product of duty to the state from a single house was in one year from  July  th to  July  th not less than £ s ½  d  The genial banks of the  Thames  opposite to our capital yield almost every species of white wine and by a wondrous magic Messrs  Beaufoy  pour forth the materials for the rich  Frontiniac  to the more elegant tables the  Madeira  the  Caleavella  and the  Lisbon  into every part of the kingdom  THIS great work and that for the making of vinegar  AND VINEGAR  is at a small distance from Mrs  Coade  's I can scarcely say how much I was struck with the extent of the undertaking There is a magnificence of business in this ocean of sweets and sours that cannot fail exciting the greatest admiration whether we consider the number of vessels or their size  GREAT TONS  The boasted ton at  Heydelberg  does not surpass them On first entering the yard two rise before you covered at the top with a thatched dome between  them is a circular turret including a winding staircase which brings you to their summits which are above twentyfour feet in diameter One of these conservatories is full of sweet wine and contains fifty eight thousand one hundred and nine gallons or eighteen hundred and fifteen barrels of  Winchester  measure Its superb associate is full of vinegar to the amount of fifty six thousand seven hundred and ninetynine gallons or seventeen hundred and seventyfour barrels of the same standard as the former The famous  German  vessel yields even to the last by the quantity of forty barrels  According to Mr  Keysler  the  Heydelberg  vessel holds two hundred and four tons    BESIDES these is an avenue of lesser vessels which hold from thirtytwo thousand five hundred to sixteen thousand nine hundred and seventyfour gallons each After quitting this  Brobdignagian  scene we pass to the acres covered with common barrels we cannot diminish our ideas so suddenly but at first we imagined we could quaff them off as easily as  Gulliver  did the little hogsheads of the kingdom of  Lilliput  THIS ground so profitable to the proprietors and so productive of revenue to the state was in my memory the scene of low dissipation  CUPER'S GARDEN  Here stood  Cuper's Garden  noted for its fireworks and the great resort of the profligate of both sexes This place was ornamented with several of the mutilated statues belonging to  Thomas  earl of  Arundel  which had been for that purpose begged from his lordship by one  Boyder Cuper  a gardener in the family  Howard  Memoirs  The more valuable part were bought by lord  Lemster  father of the first earl of  Pomfret  and presented by the earl's widow to the university of  Oxford  These grounds were then rented by lord  Arundel  On the pulling down of  Arundel  house to make way for the street of that name these and several others of the damaged part of the collection were removed to this place Numbers were left on the ground near the riverside and overwhelmed with the rubbish brought from the foundation of the new church of  St Paul  's These in aftertimes were discovered dug up and conveyed to the seat of the duke of  Norfolk  at  Worksop  manor Injured as they are they appear from the etchings given by Doctor  Ducarel  to have had great merit  THE great timberyards  GREAT TIMBERYARDS  beneath which these antiquities were found are very well worthy of a visit One would fear that the forests of  Norway  and the  Baltic  would be exhausted to supply the want of our overgrown capital were we not assured that the resources will successively be increasing equal to the demand of succeeding ages  IN this parish are the vast distilleries  GREAT DISTILLERY  till of late the property of Sir  Joseph Mawhey  There are seldom less than two thousand hogs constantly grunting at this place which are kept entirely on the grains I lament to see the maxim of private vices being public benefits so strongly exemplified in the produce of the duty on this  Stygian  liquor From  July  th to  July  th it yielded £ And I have been told of a single distiller who contributed to that sum £  TO the south are  St George's Fields  ST GEORGE'S FIELDS  now the wonder of foreigners approaching by this road to our capital through avenues of lamps of magnificent breadth and goodness I have heard that a foreign ambassador who happened to make his  entry at night imagined that these illuminations  Written before the shameful adulteration of the oil has almost given to this once glorious splendor as well as that of most of our streets little better than a "darkness visible"  were in honor of his arrival and as he modestly expressed more than he could have expected On this spot have been found remains of tesselated pavements coins and an urn full of bones  Gale's I  n Anton    possibly the site of a summer camp of the  Romans  In this place it could have been no other It was too wet for a residentiary station Its neighbor  Lambeth  marsh was in the last century overflown with water but  St George's Fields  might from their distance from the river admit of a temporary encampment  ON approaching  St George's Fields  from  Westminster  bridge are two charities of uncommon delicacy and utility The first is the  Westminster Lyingin Hospital  This is not instituted merely for the honest matron who can depose her burthen with the consciousness of lawful love but also for the unhappy wretches whom some villain in the unguarded moment hath seduced and then left a prey to desertion of friends poverty want and guilt Least such  may be driven to despair by such complicated misery and be tempted to destroy themselves and murder their infants  See the account of the institution    here was founded in this humane preventative  The Westminster New Lyingin Hospital  To obviate all objection to its being an encouragement to vice no one is taken in a second time but this most excellent charity is open to the worthy distressed matron as often as necessity requires None are rejected who have friends to recommend And of both descriptions  upwards of four thousand have experienced its salutary effects  FARTHER on is another institution of a most heavenly nature  ASYLUM OR HOUSE OF REFUGE  calculated to save from perdition of soul and body the brighter part of the creation such on whom Providence hath bestowed angelic faces and elegant forms designed as blessings to mankind but too often debased to the vilest uses The hazard that these innocents constantly are liable to from a thousand temptations from poverty from death of parents from the diabolical procuress and often from the stupendous wickedness of parents themselves who have been known to sell their beauteous girls for the purpose of prostitution induced a worthy band to found in the year the  Asylum  or  House of Refuge  Long may it flourish and eternal be the reward of those into whose minds so amiable a conception may have entered  FOR the salvation of those unhappy beings who had the ill fortune to lose the benefits of this divine institution at a small distance is the  Magdalen Hospital  MAGDALEN HOSPITAL  for the reception of the penitent prostitutes To save from vice is one great merit To reclame and restore to the dignity of honest rank in life is certainly not less meritorious The joy at the return of one sinner to repentance is esteemed by the highest authority worthy of the heavenly host That ecstasy I trust this institution has often occasioned Since its foundation in the same year with the former to  December  th not fewer than have been admitted Of these it is not to be wondered that long and evil habits are often incurable have been discharged uneasy under constraint proved lunatics and afflicted with incurable fits have died never returned from hospitals they were sent to  discharged for faults and irregularitiesHow to be dreaded is the entrance into the bounds of vice since the retreat from its paths is so difficult Finally prodigals have been returned to their rejoicing parents or placed in reputable services or to honest trades banes to idleness and securities against a future relapse  IAN  TRES  IN this neighborhood are two theatres of innocent recreation in which every government should indulge its subjects as preservations from worse employs and as relaxations from the cares of life of a nature unknown to every other part of  Europe  the  British Hippedromes  belonging to Messrs  Astley  and  Hughes  where the wonderful  gacity of that most useful animal the horse is fully evinced While we admire its admirable docility and apprehension we cannot less admire the powers of the riders and the graceful attitudes the human frame is capable of receiving But there is another species of amusement usually reckoned of a despicable kind yet ever since I read Doctor  Delaney  's thoughts  Observations upon lord  Orrery  's remarks on the life and writings of Doctor  Sw  ft  p to  on the subject I have looked on the art of  tumbling  with admiration It shews us how fearfully and wonderfully we are made What infinite misfortunes would befal us which almost every step is liable to was it not for that wise construction of parts that pliability of limb that unperceived by us protects us in every contrived motion or accidental slip from the most dire and disabling calamities  BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK  THE borough of  Southwark  joins to the parish of  Lambeth  on the east and consists of the parishes of  St Olave  's  St Saviour  's  St George  's and  St Thomas  's  IT was called by the  Saxons Suthverke  or the  South work  in respect to some fort or fortification bearing that aspect from  London  It was also called the  Borough  or  Burg  probably for the same reason It was long independent of the city of  London  but in consideration of the inconveniences arising from the escape of malefactors from the great capital into this place it was in granted by  Edward  III to the city on payment of ten pounds annually It was then called the village of  Southwark  it was afterwards styled the bailiwick of  Southwark  and the mayor and commonalty of  London  appointed the bailiff This power did not seem sufficient to remedy the evil a more intimate connection was thought necessary in the reign of  Edward  VI on a valuable consideration payed to the crown it was formed into a twentysixth ward by the title of  Bridge ward without  and Sir  John Ayliff  was its first alderman It had long before enjoyed the privilege of sending members to parlement It is mentioned among the boroughs in the time of  Edward  III but the names of the first members which appear are  Robert Acton  and  Thomas Bulle  in The members are elected by the inhabitants paying scot and lot and returned by the bailiff  THE first time that  Southwark  is mentioned in history is on occasion of earl  Godwin  's sailing up the river to attack the royal navy of fifty ships lying before the palace of  Westminster  this was in when we are told he went  ad Suthwecree  and stayed there till the return of the tide  Simeon Dunelm  in x  Script  i    ST GEORGE's church is of considerable antiquity it is mentioned  in when  Thomas  of  Arderne  and his son bestowed it on the neighboring monks of  Bermondsey  Stow's Surva  e    It was rebuilt in by  Price  with a spire steeple most aukwardly standing upon stilts  OF CHARLES BRAND  N  NOT far from this church stood the magnificent palace of  Charles Brandon  duke of  Suffolk  the deserved favorite of  Henry  VIII After his death in it came into the king's hand who established here a royal mint It at that time was called  Southwark Place  and in great measure preserved its dignity  Edward  VI once dined in it His sister and successor presented it to  Heath  archbishop of  York  as an inn or residence for him and his successors  THE MINT  whenever they repaired to  London  As to the  Mint  it became a sanctuary to insolvent debtors at length becoming the pest of the neighborhood by giving shelter to villains of every species that awakened the attention of parlement which by the statutes and  William  III c  George  I c and  George  I c entirely took away its abused privileges  KING'SBENCH PRISON  THE  King'sbench  prison in this parish is of great antiquity To this prison was committed  Henry  prince of  Wales  afterwards  Henry  V by the spirited and honest judge  Gascoigne  for striking or insulting him on the bench It is difficult to say which we should admire most the courage of the judge or the peaceful submission of the prince to the commitment after he was freed from the phrenzy of his rage The truth of the fact has been doubted but it is delivered by several grave historians such as  Hall  who died in who mentions it  folio    Grafton  perhaps his copyist at p and the learned Sir  Thomas Elyot  a favorite of  Henry  VIII in his book called  The Governour  relates the same in p book ii c of that treatise These were all long prior to  Shakespeare  or the author of another play in the time of queen  Elizabeth  styled  Henry  V It must have been the poets that took up the relation from the historians and not the historians from the poets as some people have asserted This was not the only time of his commitment In he was confined by  John Hornesby  Dugdale  's Hist of  Warwickshire  i  mayor of  Coventry  in the  Cheleysmor  in that city and arrested with his two brothers in the priory probably for a riot committed there The reform of this great prince was very early for I never can believe him to have been a hypocrite when he wrote in that strain of piety to his father on the subject of a victory obtained at  Usk  over the famous  Glyndwr  Tour in  Wales  i  The other play of  Henry  V which I allude to was written before the year In the scene in which the historical account of the violence of the prince against the chief justice is introduced  Richard Tarlton  a famous comedian and mimic acts both judge and clown One  Knell  another drole comedian of the time acted the prince and gave the chief justice such a blow as felled him to the ground to the great diversion of the audience  Tarlton  the  judge  goes off the stage and returns  Tarlton  the  clown  he demands the cause of the laughter "O" says one  had thou beenst here to have seen what a  terrible  blow the prince gave the judge" "What strike a judge  says the clown  terrible  indeed must it be  to the judge when the very report of it makes my cheek burn  Br Biog  iii    MARSHALEEN  THE prison of the  Marshalsea  which belongs to that court and also to the king's palace at  Westminster  stands here this court had particular cognizance of murders and other offences committed within the king's court such as striking which in old times was punished with the loss of the offending hand Here also persons guilty of piracies and other offences on the high seas were confined In it was broke open by a mob of sailors who murdered a gentleman confined in it for killing one of their comrades and who had been pardoned by the count  Stow  's  Survaie    It was again broke open by  Wat Tyler  and his followers in It escaped in the infamous riots of but the  King's Bench  and the  Borough  prison and another  Borough  prison called the  Clink  were nearly at the same instant sacrificed to their fury  PARISGARDEN  IN this parish near the water on  Bankside  stood  Parisgarden  one of the antient playhouses of our metropolis  Ben Johnson  is reproached by one  Decker  an envious critic with his ill success on the stage and in particular with having performed the part of  Zuliman  at  ParisGarden  It seems to have been much frequented on  Sundays  This profanation was at length fully punished by the dire accident which heavendirected befel the spectators in when the scaffolding suddenly fell and multitudes of people were killed or miserably maimed The omen seems to have been accepted for in the next century the manor of  ParisGarden  was erected into a parish and a church  founded under the name of CHRIST's This calamity seems to have been predicted by one  Crowley  a poet of the reign of  Henry  VIII who likewise informs us that in this place were exhibited bearbaitings as well as dramatical entertainments and upon  Sundays  as they are to this time at the  Combat des Animaux  at  Paris  What folly is this to keep with danger  A great mastive dog and fowle ouglie bear  And to this an end to see them two fight  With terrible tearings a ful ouglie sight  And methinkes those men are most fools of al  Whose store of money is but very smal  And yet every  Sunday  they wil surely spend  One peny or two the Bearwards living to mend  At  Paris Garden  each  Sunday  a man shal not fail  To find two or three hundred for the Bearwards vale  One halfpeny a piece they use for to give  When some have not more in their purses I believe  Wel at the last day their conscience wil declare  That the poor ought to have al that they may spare  If you therefore give to see a bear fight  Be sure God his curse upon you wil light  BEYOND this place of brutal amusement were the  BearGarden  and place for baiting of bulls the  British circi  "Herein" says  Stow  Survaie      were kept beares bulls and other beasts to be bayted as also mastives in several kenels nourished to bayt them These beares and other beasts are there kept  in plots of ground scaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe  In the old maps these  circi  are engraven  BEARBAITING  BEARbaiting made one of the amusements of the romantic age of queen  Elizabeth  for there was still left a strong tincture of those of the savage and warlike period It was introduced among the princely pleasures of  Kenilworth  in where the drole author of the account introduces the bear and dogs deciding their antient grudge  per duellum  Well Syr says he the bearz wear brought foorth intoo coourt the dogs set too them too argu the points eeven face to face they had learnd coounsell

the  French  ambassadors to be carried to this theatre to divert them with these bloody spectacles  Strype  's  Annals  i    NOT far from these scenes of cruel pastime was the  Bordello  THE STEWS  or  Stews  permitted and openly licensed by government under certain laws or regulations They were farmed out Even a lord mayor the great Sir  William Walworth  did not disdain to own them and he rented them to the  Froes  i e the bawds of  Flanders  Among other regulations no stewholder was to admit married women nor like pious  Calvinists  in  Holland  to this present day were they to keep open their houses on  Sundays  nor were they to admit any women who had on them the perilous infirmity of burning c c  Stow  's  Survaie    These infamous houses were suppressed in the reign of  Henry  VIII The pretence of these establishments was to prevent the debauching the wives and daughters of the citizens so that all who had not the gift of continence might have places to repair to Perhaps in days when thousands were tied up by vows of celibacy these haunts might have been necessary for neither cowl nor cope had virtue sufficient to annihilate the strongest of human passions Old  Latimer  complains bitterly that the offence was not taken away with the suppression of the houses "One thing I must here" says the zealous preacher  desire you to reforme my lordes you have put downe the  Stewes  But I pray you whow is the matter amended What avayleth that you have but changed the place and not taken the whd me away There is now more whdme in  London  then ever there was on the  Bancke  Third Sermon preached before king  Edward  p    THE signs were not hung out but painted against the walls I cannot but smile at one the  Cardinal's Hat  I will not give into scandal so far as to suppose that this house was peculiarly protected by any coeval member of the sacred college Neither would I by any means insinuate that the bishops of  Winchester  and  Rochester  or the abbots of  Waverley  or of  St Augustine's  in  Canterbury  or of  Battel  or of  Hyde  or the prior of  Lewes  had here their temporary residences for them or their trains for the sake of these conveniencies in that period of cruel and unnatural restriction  BESIDES these temporary mansions of holy men were others for those who preferred the monastic life The first religious house was that of  St Mary Overie  ST MARY OVERIE  said to have been originally founded by a maiden named  Mary  for sisters and endowed with the profits of a ferry cross the  Eye  or river  Thames Swithen  a noble lady changed it into a college of priests but in the year it was refounded by  William Pont de L'arche  and  William Dauncy Norman  knights for canons regular The last prior was  Bartholomew Linsted  alias  Fowle  who surrendered the convent  to  Henry  in  October  and received in reward a pension of £ a year Its revenues according to  Dugdale  were £  s    d  Tanner  I heartily wish that the editor of the last edition of this useful author had paged the work I have caused my copy to be paged with a pen for my own use so have left a blank to be filled  William Giffard  bishop of  Winchester  in the reign of  Henry  I was a great benefactor to this place and built the conventual church It certainly was not the present church for in the days of  Giffard  the round arch and clumsy pillar was in full fashion This church was probably burnt in the fire which consumed the priory in for we know it was rebuilt in the time of  Richard  II or  Henry  IV The whole is a beautiful pile of gothic architecture in form of a cross but much deformed by a wooden gallery which the increase of the congregation occasioned to be built On the dissolution the inhabitants of  Southwark  purchased the church of the king and converted it into a parish church and by act of parlement united it with that of  St Margaret's of the Hill  under the name of  St Saviour's  WITHIN beneath a rich gothic arch in the north wall  TOMB OF THE POET GOWER  is the monument of the celebrated poet  John Gower  His figure is placed recumbent in a long gown on his head is a chaplet of roses and from his neck a collar of SS under his feet are three books denoting his three principal works On one is inscribed  Speculum Meditantis  which he had written in  French  on the second  Vox Clamantis  written in  Latin  and on the last  Confessio Amantis  in  English  Above on the wall are painted three female figures crowned and with scrolls in their hands  The first which is named  Charitie  hath on her scroll  En toy qui es fite de Dieu le pere  Sauve soit que gist souz cest piere  On that of the second who is named  Mercie  O bone  Jesu  fait ta mercie  Al alme dont le corps gist icy  And on the scroll of the third named  Pitie  Pur ta pite JESU regarde  Et met cest alme en sauve garde  HE founded a chauntry for himself within these walls and was also a signal benefactor to the church He was a man of family and had a liberal education according to the times in the inns of court Notwithstanding the word  Armiger  in the modern inscription it is probable he was a knight  Leland  Collect iii

most perfect amity  Chaucer  was a severe reprover of the vices of the clergy and each united in their great and successful endeavour to give a polish to the  English  language  Chaucer  gave a free rein to his poetical mirth  Gower  's poetry was grave and sententious He has much good sense solid reflection and useful observation But he is serious and didactic on all occasions He preserves the tone of the scholar and the moralist on the most lively topics  Mr  Thomas Warton    These fathers of  English  poetry followed each other closely to the grave  Chaucer  died in aged  Gower  in blind and full of years  A RECUMBENT figure of a bishop in his robes and badges  OF BISHOP ANDREWS  as prelate of the Garter commemorates the pious hospitable and witty  Launcelot Andrews  bishop of  Winchester  who died in his adjacent palace in aged seventyone  James  I at dinner attended by  Neale  bishop of  Durham  and this amiable churchman asked of the first whether he might not take his subjects money without the assistance of parlement "God forbid" says the servile  Neale  but you should you are the breath of our nostrils  Then turning to  Andrews  Well my lord what say you The good bishop would have evaded the question but the  king being peremptory he answered  Then Sir I think it lawful to take my brother  Neale  's money for he offers it  WINCHESTERHOUSE  Winchesterhouse  was a very large building not far from this church the founder is unknown Till the civil wars of the last century it was the residence of the prelates during their attendance in parlement Much of it is yet standing tenanted by different families or converted into warehouses The great court is called  Winchestersquare  and in the adjacent street is the abutment of one of the gates  THE CLINK  THE  Clink  or manor of  Southwark  is still under the jurisdiction of the bishops of  Winchester  who besides a courtleet keeps a court of record on the  Bankside  by his steward and bailiff for pleas of debt trespasses c  IN  Southwark Park  on the back of  Winchesterhouse  was found by Sir  William Dugdale  knight in in sinking the cellars for new buildings a very curious tesselated pavement with a border in form of a serpentine column  Dugdale  on embanking    MONUMENT OF LOCKYER A QUACK DOCTOR  A FIGURE with its head reclined on one hand in a great wig and furred gown represents  Lionel Lockyer  a celebrated quack of the reign of  Charles  II His virtues and his pills are thus expressed  His virtues and his pills so well are known  That envy can't confine them under stone  But they'l survive his dust and not expire  Till all things else at th' universal fire  This verse is lost his pills embalm him safe  To future times without an epitaph  I believe the last to be prophetic his pills being to be found  among the long list of quackeries which promise almost immortality to the credulous taker  HERE are two other ridiculous epitaphs  RIDICULOUS EPITAPHS  which promise to the deceased a place in court after they have passed the limits of the grave Thus  John Trehearne  porter to  James  I is told of the reversion he is to have in heaven  In thy king's court good place to thee is given  Whence thou shalt go to the King's court of heaven  But Miss  Barford  is flattered in a still higher manner  Such grace the King of kings bestow'd upon her  That now she lives with him a maid of honour  AGAINST a wall is a singular diminutive figure one foot three inches long said to represent a dwarf one  William Emerson  who died in aet He is represented half naked much emaciated lying in his shroud on a mat most neatly cut  I SHALL conclude this list with the monument of  Richard Humble  his two wives and children not on account of their grotesque figures but for the sake of the pretty and moral inscription cut on one side  Like to the damask rose you see  A PRETTY ONE  Or like the blossom on the tree  Or like the dainty flower of  May  Or like the morning of the day  Or like the sun or like the shade  Or like the gourd which  Jonas  had  Even so is man whose thread is spun  Drawn out and cut and so is done  The rose withers the blossom blasteth  The flower fades the morning hasteth  The sun sets the shadow flies  The gourd consumes and man he dies  A LITTLE to the west of this church is a lane called  Stoney street  which ran down to the waterside nearly opposite to  Dow  gate and probably was the continuation of the  Watlingstreet  road This is supposed to have been a  Roman Trajectus  and the ferry from  Londinum  into the province of  Cantium  Marks of the antient causey have been discovered on the  London  side On this the name evinces the origin The  Saxons  always give the name of  Street  to the  Roman  roads and here they gave it the addition of  Stein  or  Stoney  from the pavement they found it composed of  DEADMAN's  place  lies a little farther tradition says that it took its name from the number of dead interred there in the great plague soon after the Restoration  FROM the calamity which destroyed this church and the religious house in the year arose one of our noblest hospitals that of  St Thomas  ST THOMAS'S HOSPITAL  After the fire the canons built at a small distance from the priory an occasional building for their reception till their house could be rebuilt But in  Peter de Rupibus  bishop of  Winchester  disliking the situation removed it to a place on which  Richard  a  Norman  prior of  Bermondsey  had in erected a hospital for converts and poor children which he called the  Almery Peter de Rupibus  new founded it for canons regular and endowed it with three hundred and fortyfour pounds a year It was held from the prior and abbot of  Bermondsey  till the year when a composition was made between  the abbot and the master of the hospital of  St Thomas  for all the lands and tenements held of the abby for the old rent to be payed to the said abbot At the dissolution it was surrendered into the hands of the king In it was founded a third time by the citizens of  London  who purchased the suppressed hospital in  July  they began the reparation and in  November  following opened it for the reception of the sick and poor not fewer than two hundred and sixty were the first objects of the charity The patron was at the same time changed the turbulent  Thomas Becket  very properly giving place to the worthy apostle  St Thomas  TOWARDS the end of the last century the building fell into decay In the year the governors solicited the benevolence of the public for its support and with such success that they were enabled to rebuild it on the magnificent and extensive plan we now see It consists of three courts with colonnades between each three wards were built at the sole cost of  Thomas Frederic  esquire of  London  and three by  Thomas Guy  citizen and stationer The whole containing eighteen wards and beds The expences attending this foundation are about £ a year In the middle of the second court is a statue in brass of  Edward  VI and beneath him the representation of the halt and maimed  IN that of the third court is a stone statue of Sir  Robert Clayton  knight lord mayor of  London  dressed in character in his gown and chain He gave £ towards rebuilding this hospital and left £ towards the endowing it The statue was erected before his death which happened in  THIS excellent institution has within the last ten years admitted and discharged of  Inpatients  Outpatients  And in the last account of it appears there were admitted and discharged  Inpatients  Outpatients  Total in the year  MR GUY'S HOSPITAL  MR  Guy  not satisfied with his great benefactions to the hospital of  St Thomas  determined to be the sole founder of another The relation is very remarkable At the age of seventysix he took a lease of the governors of the former of a piece of ground opposite to it for the term of nine hundred and ninetynine years and on it in at the expence of £  s  began to build the hospital which bears his name and left to endow it the prodigious sum of £ amassed from a very small beginning chiefly by purchasing seamen's tickets in the reign of queen  Anne  and by his great success in the buying and selling South Sea stock in the memorable year and also a vast sum by the sale of bibles He seems to have profited both of GOD and  Mammon  I think he was a native of  Tamworth  and representative for that borough His death happened on  December  th before which he saw his hospital covered with the roof In the first court is his statue in brass dressed in his livery gown Besides his public expences he gave during life to many of his poor relations £ or £ a year and to others money to advance them in life to his aged relations £ in annuities and to his younger relations and executors the sum of £  IN the chapel shouldering GOD's altar is another statue of Mr  Guy  a most expensive performance by Mr  J Bacon  in in white marble He is represented standing in his livery gown with one hand raising a miserable sick object and with the other pointing to a second object on a bier carried by two persons into his hospital This superfluity cost a thousand pounds a proof of the exuberant wealth of the foundation which could spare such a sum to be wasted on an idle needless occasion I was told that at this time there were only two hundred beds three wards being out of use undergoing certain alterations But I could not obtain the lest account of the annual number of patients or of expenditure or revenue which other hospitals never fail of laying before the public  IN the laboratory is a large medallion in white marble of the great and pious BOYLE  THE other religious house in  Southwark  was  Bermondsey  BERMONDSEY ABBY  founded in by  Aylwin Childe  a citizen of  London  for monks of the  Cluniac  order a cargo of which were imported hither by favor of archbishop  Lanfranc  in the year from the priory  De Caritate  on the  Loire  in  Nivernois  Soon after the resumption of the alien priories it was converted into an abby by  Richard  II In  Tanner  it was surrendered into the king's hands by  Robert de Wharton  who had his reward not only of a pension of £  s    d  but also the bishoprick of  St Asaph  Willis  's  Abbies  i  in  commendam  The revenues of the house at the dissolution were £  s    d  the poor monks received the annual pension of from ten to about five pounds apiece  THE conventual church was then pulled down by Sir  Thomas Pope  who built a magnificent house on the site This became the habitation of the  Ratcliffs  earls of  Sussex Thomas  the great rival of the favorite earl of  Leicester  breathed his last within its walls  THE present parochial church of  St Mary Magdalen  was founded by the priors of  Bermondsey  for the use of their adjoining tenants  THE remains of antiquity in this neighborhood are the antient gate of the abby with a large arch and a postern on one side Adjoining is part of a very old building and on passing beneath the arch and turning to the left is to be seen within a court a house of very great antiquity called for what reason I know not king  John's court  BERMONDSEY  street  may at present be called the great  Wool Staple  of our kingdom Here reside numbers of merchants who supply  Rochdale Leicester Derby Exeter  and most other weaving countries in this kingdom with that commodity As  Southwark  may be considered as a great suburb to  London  numbers of other trades are carried on there to a vast extent the Tanners Curriers Hatters Dyers Ironfounders Ropemakers Sailmakers and Blockmakers occupy a considerable part of the borough  THE most eastern parish in  Southwark  is that of  St Olave  or  Olaf  so named from the  Danish  prince who was massacred by his  Pagan  subjects  ST OLAVE OR OLAF'S CHURCH  The church appears to have been founded near five hundred years ago  Maitland  ii  The parish extends from the spot on  London  bridge on which was the drawbridge and stretches  along the waterside as far as  St Saviour's Dock  In this parish near the church was the inn or lodging of the abbot of  Lewes  in  Sussex  The chapel is still remaining converted into a cellar and by the accumulation of earth sunk under ground and a gothic building now turned into a wine vault belonging to the  King'shead  tavern may have been part of the mansion  ON  Sellenger  's wharf stood the townhouse of the abbot of  St Augustine's  at  Canterbury  which being granted to Sir  Anthony SaintLeger  the wharf was named after him but corrupted according to the modern spelling  Maitland  ii    THE abbot of  Battle  had also here his citymansion  Battlebridge  or rather  Stairs  took its name from the house as did the streets called the  Mazes  from the luxurious intricacies in his magnificent gardens  Strype  's  Stow  I Book iv p    ST  Saviour's Dock  or as it is called  Savory  ST SAVIOUR'S DOCK  bounds the eastern end of this parish  St Saviour  's  Dock  may be considered as the port of  Southwark  It is in length about four hundred yards but of most disproportionable breadth not exceeding thirty feet The borough will certainly give it a more useful magnitude and also rebuild the warehouses and magazines on each side It is at present solely appropriated to barges which discharge coals copperas from  Writtlesea  in  Essex  pipeclay corn and various other articles of commerce If the dock was deepened and correspondent wharfs erected sloops and lesser vessels might come from different seaports and here discharge their cargoes without the expence of reloading lesser craft in order to reland them at this dock  IT antiently belonged to the priory of  St Saviour's Bermondsey  as did certain adjacent mills which in were let by the monks to one  John Curlew  for £ then the value of eighteen quarters of good wheat and he was besides bound to grind  gratis  all the corn used in that religious house  ROTHEPHITHE  ON the east side of the dock commences the parish of  Rotherhithe  or  Redriff  which consists chiefly of one street of a vast length running along the shore and winding with the great bend of the river to a very small space from  Deptford  The church dedicated to  St Mary  is remarkable for its steeple a fluted spire terminating in the  Ionic  scroll I introduce this parish because it is comprehended in the bills of mortality having been taken in in the year with five other parishes Near the extremity of this parish are the docks for the  Greenland  ships a profitable nusance very properly removed to a distance from the capital The greater dock is supposed to have been the mouth of the famous canal cut in by king  Canute  in order to avoid the impediment of  London  bridge and to lay siege to the capital by bringing his fleet to the west side  THE LOKE HOSPITAL  THE  Loke  in  Southwark  was a hospital for leprous persons It was dedicated to  St Leonard  and existed in the time of  Edward  II till lately it was under the care of the hospital of  St Bartholomew  appropriated to the cure of another loathsome disease The word changed into  Lock  possibly has allusion to the necessity of their being locked or kept apart from all other patients  AS the  Borough Highstreet  was the great passage into a great  part of our kingdom to and from our capital  TABARD CHAUCER'S INN  it was particularly well furnished with inns I shall only mention one immortalized by  Chaucer  The sign is now perverted into the  Talbot  It originally was the  Tabard  so called from the signa sleeveless coat open on both sides with a square collar and winged at the shoulders worn by persons of rank in the wars with their arms painted on them that they might be known The use is now transferred to the Heralds This was the rendezvous of the jolly pilgrims which formed the troop which our father of poetry describes sallying out to pay their devotions to the great  St Thomas Becket

SHAKESPEAR'S THEATRE  immortalized by having been the theatre on which  Shakespear  first trod the stage but in no  higher character than the Ghost in his own play of  Hamlet  It appears to have been of an octagonal form and is said to have been covered with rushes  See an engraving of it in vol I of  Johnson  's  Shakespear  I have been told that the door was very lately standing  James  I granted a patent to  Laurence Fletcher  WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR  Richard Burbage Augustine Philippes John Heminges Henrie Condell William Sly Robert Armin  and  Richard Cowlie  and others of his majesty's servants to act here or in any other part of the kingdom Notwithstanding the modesty of  Shakespear  made him decline taking any considerable part in his own productions his goodnature and friendship for the morose  Ben Johnson  induced him to act both in the  Sejanus  and  Every Man in his Humour  a benevolence that greatly contributed to bring the latter into public notice But in  Shakespear  's own plays  Dick Burbage  as he was familiarly called was the favorite actor  Condell  and  Heminges  were his intimate friends and published his plays in folio seven years after his death  THE playhouses in and about  London  were by this time extremely numerous there not being fewer than seventeen between the year and  WESTMINSTER  I NOW return to the extremity of the western part of our capital on the opposite shore In the time of queen  Elizabeth  the shore correspondent to  Lambeth  was a mere marshy tract  Millbank  MILLBANK  the last dwelling in  Westminster  is a large house which took its name from a mill which once occupied its site Here in my  boyish days I often experienced the hospitality of the late Sir  Robert Grovenour  its worthy owner who enjoyed it by the purchase by one of his family from the  Mordaunts  earls of  Peterborough  All the rest of his vast property about  London  devolved on him in right of his mother  Mary  daughter and heiress of  Alexander Davies  of  Ebury  in the county of  Middlesex  I find in the plan of  London  by  Hollar  a mansion on this spot under the name of  Peterborough  house It probably was built by the first earl of  Peterborough  It was inhabited by his successors and retained its name till the time of the death of that great but irregular genius  Charles  earl of  Peterborough  in It was rebuilt in its present form by the  Grovenour  family  A LITTLE farther was the antient  Horseferry  between  Westminster  and  Lambeth  HORSEFERRY  suppressed on the building of  Westminster  bridge  A LITTLE beyond the  Horseferry  stands the church of  St John the Evangelist  one of the fifty voted by parlement to give this part of the town the air of the capital of a christian country It was begun in and finished in The architect was Sir  John Vanbrugh  Notwithstanding it is deservedly censured for its load of ornaments they are by no means destitute of beauty The aim at excess of magnificence is not a fault peculiar to the builder  AT a small distance to the east is that noble specimen of gothic architecture  WESTMINSTER ABBY  the conventual church of  St Peter  's abby of  Westminster  The church is said to have been founded about the year by  Sebert  king of the  EastSaxons  FOUNDED BY SEBERT  on the ruins of the temple of  Apollo  flung down quoth legend by an earthquake  The king dedicated his new church to  St Peter  who descended in person with a host of heavenly choristers to save the bishop of  Mellitus  the trouble of consecration The saint descended on the  Surry  side in a stormy night but prevaling on  Edric  a fisherman to waft him over performed the ceremony and as a proof left behind the chrism and precious droppings of the wax candles with which the astonished fisherman saw the church illuminated He conveyed the saint safely back who directed him to inform the bishop that there was no farther need of consecration He likewise directed  Edric  to fling out his nets who was rewarded with a miraculous draft of falmons the saint also promised to the fisherman and his successors that they never should want plenty of salmon provided they presented every tenth to his church This custom was observed till at lest the year The fisherman that day had a right to sit at the same table with the prior and he might demand of the cellerer ale and bread and the cellerer again might take of the fish's tail as much as he could with four fingers and his thumb erect  THE place in which it was built was then styled  Thornie  island from its being overrun with thorns and briers and it was besides insulated by a branch of the  Thames  This church was burnt by the  Danes  BURNT BY THE DANES REBUILT BY EDGAR  and restored by the incontinent king  Edgar  in under the influence of  St Dunstan  the most continent of men and such a lover of celibacy that he drove out of the church every married priest  Edgar  ravished nuns but he founded or refounded fifty monasteries and planted with very poor endowments in this twelve monks of the  Benedictine  order  AGAIN BY EDWARD THE CONFESSOR  IT was reserved for the pious Confessor to rebuild both church and abby he began the work in and finished it in a most  magnificent manner in and endowed it with the utmost munificence An abby is nothing without reliques  RELIQU  S  Here was to be found the veil and some of the milk of the virgin the bladebone of  St Benedict  the finger of  St Alphage  the head of  St Maxilla  and half the jawbone of  St Anastasia  The good  Edward  was buried in his own church  William  the Conqueror bestowed on his tomb a rich pall and in  Henry  II lodged his body in a costly ferretry translating it from its pristine place  WHETHER from the decay of the building  REBUILT A THIRD TIME BY HENRY III  or a particular zeal and affection  Henry  III had for the royal  Confessor  I cannot say but that prince pulled down the  Saxon  pile and rebuilt it in the present elegant and magnificent style In he began this great work in the mode of architecture which began to take place in his days He did not live to complete his design which was carried on by his successor and finished in his fourteenth year A casual fire destroyed the roof but by the piety of  Edward  and several of the abbots it was restored to the beauty and splendor we so justly admire  HENRY performed two acts of pious respect to the remains of the founders of this abby which must not be omitted He translated those of  Sebert  into a tomb of touchstone beneath an arch made in the wall Above were paintings long since defaced done by order of the king who was strongly imbued with the love of the arts Mr  Walpole  Anecdotes of Painting i seq  has preserved several of the precepts for number of paintings in this church and other places Among  them is directions for painting  duos  CHERUMBINOS  cum hilar i vultu et jocoso  SHRINE OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR BY CAVALINI  BUT what does that prince the most honor is the shrine  Engraven by Mr  Vertue  and published among the  Vetusta Monumenta  ab xvi  which he caused to be made in honor of the  Confessor  placed in a chapel which bears his name This beautiful mosaic work was the performance of  Peter Cavalini  inventor of that species of ornament It is supposed that he was brought into  England  by the abbot  Ware  who visited  Rome  in  Weever  expressly says  He brought from thence certain workmen and rich porphery stones whereof hee made that curious singular rare pavement before the high altar and with these stones and workmen he did also frame the shrine of  Edward  the Confessor  Funeral Monuments    This beautiful memorial consists of three rows of arches the lower pointed the upper round And on each side of the lower is a most elegant twisted pillar an ornament the artist seems peculiarly fond of Children or childish age has greatly injured this beautiful shrine by picking out the mosaic through the shameful connivance of the attendant vergers  ANOTHER BY THE SAME ARTIST  THIS is not the only specimen of  Cavalini  's skill which we possess in this kingdom Mr  Walpole  has at his beautiful villa near town another shrine of his workmanship brought in from the church of  Santa Maria Maggiore  in  Rome  and placed in a chapel in his gardens It was erected in over the bodies of the holy martyrs  Simplicius Faustina  and  Beatrix  by  John James Capoccio  and  Vinia  his wife It differs in form from  the shrine of  St Edward  but is formed of the same materials and adorned with the same twisted columns  ALONG the freeze of the screen of the chapel are fourteen legendary sculptures respecting the Confessor They are so rudely done that we may conclude that the art at this time was at a very low ebb The first is the trial of queen  Emma  The next the birth of  Edward  Another is his coronation The fourth tells us how our saint was frightened into the abolition of the  danegelt  by his seeing the devil dance upon the money bags The fifth is the story of his winking at the thief who was robbing his treasury The sixth is meant to relate the appearance of our SAVIOUR to him The seventh shews how the invasion of  England  was frustrated by the drowning of the  Danish  king Eighthly is seen the quarrel between the boys  Tosti  and  Harold  predicting their respective fates In the ninth sculpture is the  Confessor  's vision of the seven sleepers Tenthly how he meets  St John the Evangelist  in the guise of a pilgrim Eleventhly how the blind were cured by their eyes being washed in his dirty water Twelfthly how  St John  delivers to the pilgrims a ring In the thirteenth they deliver the ring to the king which he had unknowingly given to  St John  as an alms when he met him in the form of a pilgrim This was attended with a message from the  Saint  foretelling the death of the king And the fourteenth shews the consequential haste made by him to complete his pious foundation  All these are accurately engraven and fully explained in the first volume of Mr  Carter  's Antiquities    IN this very chapel is a third proof of the skill of either  Cavalini  or some of his pupils  HENRY III HIS TOMB BY THE  E  It is an altar tomb of  Henry  himself enriched like the shrine and with wreathed columns at each corner  See  Sandf  rd  's Genealogies  Dart  tab vol ii  Gough  's Sepulch Mon i tab xx xxi  The figure of this prince who died in is of brass and placed recumbent This is supposed to have been the first brazen image known to have been cast in our kingdom The little book sold to the visitors of this solemn scenery at the door will be a sufficient guide to the fine and numerous funebrial memorials of the place Let me only observe that here may be read an excellent lecture on the progress of these efforts of human skill from the simple altar tomb to the most ostentatious proofs of human vanity The humble recumbent figure with uplifted hands as if deprecating the justice of Heaven for the offences of this mortal state or the proper kneeling attitude supplicating that mercy which the purest must stand in need of may be seen here in various degrees of elegance The careless lolling attitude of heroes in long gowns and flowing perriwigs next succeed and after them busts or statues vaunting their merits and attended with such a train of  Pagan  deities that would almost lead to suppose oneself in a heathen  Pantheon  instead of a  Christian  church  IN the antient tombs there is a dull uniformity The sides are often embellished with figures of the offspring of the deceased often with figures of mourners  pleureurs  or weepers  See the curious contract in  Dugdale  's  Warwickshire  p between the executors of  Richard Beauchamp  earl of  Warwick  and  John Essex  marbler  William Austin  founder and  Thomas Stevens  coppersmith for their making xiv lords and ladyes in divers vestures called  weepers  and xiv images of  mourners  to be gilt by

accustomed  in  Catholic  countries to pour out their pious inhabitants to form processions at the funerals of the great The tomb of  Aymer de Valence  in this abby is surrounded by his mourners  IN the reign of queen  Elizabeth  and  James  I begins to appear a ray of taste in the sculptors I shall instance one of the six sons of  Henry  lord  Norris  who appear kneeling round his magnificent cenotaph for he was buried at  Rycot  in the chapel of  St Andrew  This figure has one hand on his breast the other a little removed from it in attitude of devotion inexpressibly fine Lord  Norris  died in  Dugdale  's Baronage ii  Dart  by mistake calls this nobleman  Francis  who was grandson to  Henry  and left only one child a daughter He fell a suicide in a fit of proud resentment for an imaginary affront on account of a lord  Scrope  which he had not the sense or the courage to accommodate in a proper manner    ANOTHER proof is in the monument of Sir  Francis Vere  who died in distinguished by thirty years of able service in the low countries in the reign of  Elizabeth  He lies in a gown recumbent over him four  ne figures of armed knights kneeling on one knee support a marble slab on which are strewed the various parts of his armour At  Bredah  is the tomb of  Ingelbert  II count of  Nassau  who died in executed on the same idea  THE figure of young  Francis Hollis  son of  John  earl of  Clare  cut off at the age of eighteen in on his return from a campaign  in the  Netherlands  has great merit He is placed dressed like a  Grecian  warrior on an altar in a manner that did great credit to  Nicholas Stone  or rather to the earl to whom Mr  Walpole  justly attributes the design  THE figure of Doctor  Busby  master of  Westminster  school who died in is elegant and spirited He lies resting on one arm a pen in one a book in the other hand his countenance looking up His loose dress is very favorable to the sculptor who has given it most graceful flows the close cap alone is inimical to his art  I CANNOT go through the long series of tombs nor will I attempt like the  Egyptians  of old to bring the silent habitants to a posthumous trial or bring their frailties to light I will only mention the crowned heads who here repose till that day comes which will level every distinction of rank and shew every individual in his proper characters  Qualis erat  says a beautiful and modest inscription  iste dies indicabit  EDWARD I  THE second of our monarchs who lies here is the renowned  Edward  I in an altar tomb as modest and plain as his fame was great A long inscription in monkish lines imperfectly records the deeds of the conqueror of  Scotland  and of the antient  Britons  In antiquarian curiosity was so urgent with the respectable dean of  Westminster  as to prevale on him to permit certain members of the society under proper regulations to inspect the remains of this celebrated hero and discover if possible the composition which gave such duration to the human body  IN the minute relation given by that able and worthy antiquary the late Sir  Joseph Ayloffe  bart almost every particular is given  On lifting up the lid of the tomb the royal body was found wrapped in a strong thick linen cloth  waxed  on the inside the head and face were covered with a  sudarium  or facecloth of crimson sarcenet wrapped into three folds conformable to the napkin used by our Saviour in his way to his crucifixion as we are assured by the church of  Rome  On flinging open the external mantle the corpse was discovered in all the ensigns of majesty richly habited The body was wrapped in a fine linen cerecloth closely fitted to every part even to the very fingers and face The writs  de cera renovanda circa corpus regis Edwardi primi  Archaelogia  iii Similar warrants were issued on account of  Edward  III  Richard  II and  Henry  IV  being extant gave rise to this search Over the cerecloth was a tunic of red silk damsk above that a stole of thick white tissue crossed the breast and on this at six inches distant from each other quatrefoils of philligreework of gilt metal set with false stones imitating rubies sapphires amethysts c and the intervals between the quatrefoils on the stole powdered with minute white beads tacked down into a most elegant embroidery in form not unlike what is called the true lover's knot Above these habits was the royal mantle of rich crimson sattin fastened on the left shoulder with a magnificent  fibula  of gilt metal richly chased and ornamented with four pieces of red and four of blue transparent paste and twentyfour more pearls  THE corpse from the waist downwards is covered with a rich cloth of figured gold which falls down to the feet and is tucked beneath them On the back of each hand was a quatrefoil like those on the stole In his right hand is a sceptre with a cross of copper gilt and of elegant workmanship reaching to the right  shoulder In the left hand is the rod and dove which passes over the shoulder and reaches the royal ear The dove stands on a ball placed on three ranges of oak leaves of enamelled green the dove is white enamel On the head is a crown charged with trefoils made of gilt metal  The dress is represented on a seal of this monarch's in  Sandford  's Genealogy with tolerable accuracy  The head is lodged in the cavity of the stonecoffin always observable in those receptacles of the dead I refer the reader to the  Archaelogia  for the other  minutiae  attendant on the habiting of the royal corse It was dressed in conformity to antient usage even as early as the time of the  Saxon Sebert  And the use of the cerecloth is continued to our days in the instance of our late king the two serjeantsurgeons had £  s    d  each for opening and embalming and the apothecary £ for a fine double  cerecloth  and a due quantity of rich perfumed aromatic powders  Archaelogia  iii    ELIANOR HIS QUEEN  ELIANOR of  Castile  the beautiful and affectionate queen of  Edward  was in deposited here Her figure  Sandford    in copper gilt rests on a tablet of the same placed on an altar tomb of  Petworth  marble  THE murdered prince  Edward  II

Sepulch Mon i tab lv lvi  His worthy queen  Philippa  was interred  at his feet  Sandford    Gough  i tab xxiii  Her figure in alabaster represents her as a most masculine woman She died in her royal spouse in His latter end was marked with misfortunes by the death of his son the Black Prince by a raging pestilence but more by his unseasonable love in his doating years How finely does Mr  Gray  paint his death and the gay entrance of his successor into power in the bitter taunt he puts into the mouth of a  British  bard  Mighty victor mighty lord  Low on his funeral couch he lies  No pitying heart no eye afford  A tear to grace his obsequies  Is the sable warrior fled  Thy son is gone he rests among the dead  The swarm that in thy noontide beam were born  Gone to salute the rising morn  Fair laughs the morn and soft the  Zephyr  blows  While proudly riding o'er the azure realm  In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes  Youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm  Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway  That hush'd in grim repose expects his eveningprey  THE tomb of the wasteful unfortunate prince  Richard  II and his first consort  Anne  daughter of  Wincelaus  king of  Bohemia  RICHARD II  is the next in order  Sandford    Gough  's Sepulch Mon i tab lxi lxii  Their figures in the same metal as the former lie recumbent on it He had directed these to be made in his lifetime by  B  and  Godfrey  of  Woodstreet  goldsmiths the expence of gilding them cost four hundred marks The countenance  of  Richard  is very unlike the beautiful painting of him on board  HIS PORTRAIT  six feet eleven inches high by three feet seven inches broad He is represented sitting in a chair of state with a globe in one hand the sceptre in the other a crown on his head and his dress extremely rich and elegant many parts marked with his initial R surmounted with a crown His countenance remarkably fine and gentle little indicative of his bad and oppressive reign  Vetusta Monumenta  tab iv    THIS picture after the test of near four hundred years is in the highest preservation and not less remarkable for the elegance of the coloring than the excellent drawing considering the early age of the performance We must allow it had been repainted but nothing seems altered if we may collect from the print made by  Vertue  excepting a correction in the site of the cross issuing out of the globe The back ground is elevated above the figure of an uneven surface and gilt The curious will find in Mr  Walpole  's Anecdotes vol i an ingenious conjecture of the method of painting in that early period which has given such amazing duration to the labors of its artists  THIS portrait was originally hung up in the choir of the abby but about a dozen years ago was removed to the  Jerusalem  chamber  HENRY V  WITHIN a beautiful chapel of gothic workmanship of open ironwork ornamented with various images is the tomb of the gallant prince  Henry  V  Sandford    a striking contrast to the weak and  luxurious  Richard  This was built by  Henry  VII in compliment to his illustrious relation and predecessor His queen  Catherine  had before erected his monument and placed his image cut in heart of oak and covered over with silver on an altar tomb the head was as the guide tells us of solid silver which in the reign of  Henry  VIII was sacrilegiously stolen away The wooden headless trunk still remains  ON each side of this royal chapel is a winding staircase inclosed in a turret of open ironwork which leads into a chauntry founded for the purpose of masses for the repose of the soul of this great prince The front looks over the shrine of the Confessor Here is kept a parcel of human figures which in old times were dressed out and carried at funeral processions but at present very deservedly have got the name of the  ragged regiment  More worthy of notice is the elegant termination of the  columellae  of the two staircases which spread at the top of the turrets into roofs of uncommon elegance  ONE end of this chauntry rests against that of the chapel of  Henry  VII Among the stone statues placed there is the  French  patron  St Dennis  most composedly carrying his head in his hand  ON the south side of the chauntry over his monument is the representation of his coronation The figure of  Henry  is distinguished by a wen under his chin It is probable that it was belonging to that monarch as it is not to be supposed that the sculptor would have added a deformity  Mr  Carter  intends to engrave this in his specimens of antient sculpture    CATHERINE his royal consort  HIS QUEEN  had less respect payed to her  remains She had sunk from the bed of the conqueror of  France  to that of a common gentleman yet gave to these kingdoms a long line of princes She died in and was interred in the chapel of our lady in this church When her grandson  Henry  VII ordered that to be pulled down to make room for his own magnificent chapel he ungratefully neglected the remains of this his ancestress and suffered them to be flung carelessly into a wooden chest where they still rest near her  Henry  's tomb  EDWARD V AND HIS BROTHER  NEXT is the cenotaph of the two innocents  Edward  V and his brother  Richard  duke of  York  In the reign of  Charles  II certain small bones were found in a chest under a staircase in the  Tower  These by order of  Charles  were removed here and under the supposition of their belonging to the murdered princes this memorial of their sad fate was erected by order of that humane monarch after a design by Sir  Christopher Wren  Parentalia      HENRY VII HIS CHAPEL  IN order of time I must pass into the beautiful chapel of  Henry  VII nearly the rival in elegance with that of  King's College Cambridge  Who can look at the roof of either without the highest admiration  Henry  finding the chapel of the Confessor too much crouded to receive any more princes determined on the building of this That of the Virgin was sacrificed to it also an adjacent tavern distinguished by the popular sign of the  White Rose  Abbot  Islip  on the part of the king laid the first stone on  February  th The royal miser scrupled no expence in this piece of vanity By his will it appears that he expressly intended it as the mausoleum of him and his house and that none but the  blood royal should be interred in this magnificent foundation It was built at the expence of fourteen thousand pounds  Will of  Henry  VII preface p iv  In the body of this chapel is his superb tomb the work of  Pietro Torregiano  a  Florentine  sculptor who had for his labor and the materials one thousand pounds This admirable artist continued in  London  till the completion of his work in But the reigning prince and  Torregiano  were of tempers equally turbulent so they soon separated  Anecdotes of Painting i  To him is attributed the altar tomb of  Margeret  countess of  Richmond  with her figure recumbent in brass  Henry

tomb itself is as he directed made of a hard  Basaltic  stone called in the language of those days  Touche  The figures contained in the six bas reliefs in brass on the sides are strong proofs of the skill of the artist The figures suit the superstition of the times  St Michael  and the devil joined with the Virgin and Child  St George  with  St Anthony  and his pig  St Christopher  and perhaps  St Anne Edward  the Confessor and a  Benedictine  monk  Mary Magdalen  and  St Barbara  and several others One pretence is a respect to his grandmother whose bones he left flung into an ordinary chest He and his quiet neglected queen lie in brass on an altar tomb within the beautiful brazen precinct his face resembles all his portraits I have seen a model a still stronger likeness in possession of Mr  Walpole  a bust in  stone taken from his face immediately after his death A stronger reluctance to quit the possessions of this world could never be expressed on the countenance of the most griping mortal  WITHIN the grate of the tomb was an altar of a single piece of touchstone destroyed by the fanatics to which he bequeathed  our grete piece of the holie crosse which by the high provision of our Lord God was conveied brought and delivered to us from the isle of  Cyo  in  Grece  set in gold and garnished with perles and precious stones and also the preciouse relique of oon of

Corinthian  order  Dart  i  Two great blemishes obscure the characters of this illustrious pair  Elizabeth  will never be vindicated from treachery hypocrisy and cruelty in the death of  Mary  The love of her subjects was the pretext the reality a female jealousy of superior charms at the bottom with the  spretae injuria formae  discovered in a letter of passion accusing another female  See the famous letter of  Mary Stuart  in  Burghley  's state papers  perhaps equally touched with  the same tormenting passion The long and undeserved sufferings of  Mary  from one of her own sex a sister

delightful moralist upon the tombs of the great every emotion of envy dies in me when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone my heart melts with compassion when I see the tomb of the parents themselves I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow when I see kings lying by those who deposed them when I consider rival wits placed side by side or the holy men that divided the world with their contests and disputes I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions factions and debates of mankind When I read the several dates of the tombs of some that died yesterday  and some six hundred years ago I consider that great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together  ON the dissolution this great monastery the second mitred abby in the kingdom underwent the common lot of the religious houses In the abbot  William Benson  subscribed to the king's supremacy and in surrendered his monastery into the royal hands and received as a reward the office of first dean to the new foundation consisting of a dean and twelve prebendaries He also erected it into a bishoprick but its only bishop was  Thomas Thirleby  it being suppressed in on his translation to  Norwich  When the protector  Somerset  ruled in the fulness of power this magnificent this sacred pile narrowly escaped a total demolition It was his design to have pulled it down to the ground and to have applied the materials towards the palace he was then erecting in the  Strand  known by the name of  Somerset  house He was diverted from his design by a bribe of not fewer than fourteen manors Mortals should be very delicate in pronouncing the vengeance of Heaven on their fellowcreatures yet in this instance without presumption without superstition one may suppose his fall to have been marked out by the Almighty as a warning to impious men He fell on the scaffold on  Towerhill  lamented only because his overthrow was effected by a man more wicked more ambitious and more detested than himself In their ends there was a consent of justice both died by the ax and both of their headless bodies were flung within a very short space into the same place among the attainted herd  IN the reign of queen  Mary  the former religion of the place experienced a brief restoration She with great zeal restored it  to the antient conventual state collected many of the rich habits and insignia of that splendid worship established fourteen monks and appointed for their abbot  John Feckenham  a man of great piety and learning who on his expulsion in the succeeding reign finished his days in easy custody in  Wisbech  castle  IN it was changed into a collegiate church consisting of a dean and twelve secular canons and thirty petty canons and other members two schoolmasters and forty king's or queen's scholars twelve almsmen and many officers and servants  Tanner  But there seems to have been a school there from the first foundation of the abby  Ingulphus  abbot of  Crowland  speaks of his having been educated at it and of the disputations he had with the queen of the  Confessor  and of the presents she made him in money in his boyish days  Quoted by  Stow  book vol i    CLOISTERS AND CHAPTERHOUSE  BESIDES the church many of the antient parts remain The cloisters are entire and filled with monuments The north and west cloisters were built by abbot  Littlington  who died in he also built the granary which was afterwards the dormitory of the king's scholars of later years rebuilt  THE entrance into the chapterhouse built in is on one side of the cloister through a most rich and magnificent gothic portal the mouldings most exquisitely carved this is divided into two gothic doors After a descent of several steps is the chapterhouse an octagon each side of which had most superb and lofty windows now filled up and lighted by lesser The opening into this room is as noble as that from the cloister The stone  roof is destroyed and one of plank is substituted The central pillar remains light slender and elegant surrounded by eight others bound by two equidistant  fasciae  and terminated in capitals of beautiful simplicity By consent of the abbot in the commons of  Great Britain  first held their parlements in his place the crown undertaking the repairs Here they sat till the year when  Edward  VI granted the chapel of  St Stephen  for that purpose It is at present filled with the public records among which is the original  Domesday  book now above seven hundred years old it is in as fine preservation as if it was the work of yesterday  BENEATH the chapterhouse is a very singular crypt The roof which forms the floor of the former is supported by a short round pillar quite hollow The top spreads into massy plain ribs the supports of the roof The walls are not less than eighteen feet thick and form a most firm base to the superstructure They had been pierced with several small windows which are now lost by the vast increase of earth on the outside  This crypt is only accessible through the house of Mr  Barrow  one is just visible in the garden belonging to Mr  Barrow  THE  Jerusalem  chamber was part of the abbot's lodgings and built by  Littlington  It is noted for having been the place where  Henry  IV breathed his last he had been seized with a swoon while he was paying before the shrine of  St Edward  and being carried into this room asked on recovering where he was being informed he answered I will speak his reply in the words of  Shakespear  borrowed from history  Laud be to Godeven there my life must end  It hath been prophesied to me many years  I should not die but in  Jerusalem  Which vainly I suppos'd the HOLY LAND  The devil is said to have practised such a delusion on pope  Sylvester  II having on consultation assured his holiness that he should die in  Jerusalem  and kept his word by taking him off as he was saying mass in in a church of that name in  Rome  Brown  's  Fasciculus  i    I OMITTED to mention the revenues of this great house which in its monastic state  Speed  makes to amount to £ per ann  Dugdale  to £  SANCTUARY  NOT far from the abby stood the  Sanctuary  the place of refuge absurdly indulged in old times to criminals of certain denominations The church belonging to it was in form of a cross and double one being built over the other Such is the account that Doctor  Stukely  gives of it for he remembered it standing  Archaelogia  i p tab  it was of vast strength and was with much labor demolished It is supposed to have been the work of the  Confessor  Within its precincts was born  Edward  V and here his unhappy mother took refuge with her younger son  Richard  to secure him from his cruel uncle who had already possession of the elder brother Seduced by the persuasions of the duke of  Buckingham  and  archbishop of  York  she surrendered the little innocent who was instantly carried to his brother in the  Tower  where they were soon after involved in one common fate  TO the west of the sanctuary stood the  Eleemosynary  or  Almory  where the alms of the abby were wont to be distributed But it is still more remarkable for having been the place where the first printing press ever known in  England  was erected It was in the year when  William Caxton  probably encouraged by the learned  Thomas Milling  then abbot produced  The Game and Play of the Chesse  the first book ever printed in these kingdoms There is a slight difference about the place in which it was printed but all agree that it was within the precincts of this religious house Would the monks have permitted this could they have foreseen how certainly the art would conduce to their overthrow by the extension of knowlege and the longconcealed truths of Christianity  BENEATH the shadow of the abby stands the church of  St Margeret  built originally by  Edward  the Confessor  ST MARGARET'S CHURCH  The parish church had been in the abby to the great inconveniency of the monks It was rebuilt in the time of  Edward  I and again in that of  Edward  IV This church is honored with the remains of the great Sir  Walter Raleigh  who was interred here on the same day on which he was beheaded in  Old Palace Yard  It was left to a sensible churchwarden to inform us of the fact who inscribed it on a board about twenty years ago  THE east window is a most beautiful composition of figures  ITS FINE WINDOW  It was made by order of the magistrates of  Dort  and by them designed as a present to  Henry  VII but he dying before it was finished it was put up in  Waltham  abby there it remained till the dissolution when it was removed to  Newhall  in  Essex  afterwards part of the estate of general  Monk  who preserved it from demolition In it was purchased from the then owner by the inhabitants  of the parish for four hundred guineas By the opposition and absurdity of a cotemporary prebend this fine ornament run a great risque of being pulled down again The subject is the crucifixion a devil is carrying off the soul of the hardened thief an angel receiving that of the penitent Silly enough but the other beauties of the piece might surely have moved the reverend zealot to mercy The figures are numerous and finely done On one side is  Henry  VI kneeling above him his patron saint  St George  On the other side is his queen in the same attitude and above her the fair  St Catherine  with the instruments of her martyrdom This charming performance is engraved at the cost of the Society of Antiquaries  PALACE AT WESTMINSTER  THE royal palace which clames seniority in our capital was that of  Westminster  founded by the  Confessor  who was the first prince who had in it regular residence It stood near the  Thames  the stairs to it on the river still keep the name of  Palace stairs  and the two  Palace Yards  were also belonging to this extensive pile  THE  New Palace Yard  is the area before the hall In old times a very handsome conduit or as it was called fountain graced one part and opposite to the hall on the site of the present passage into  Bridgestreet  stood a lofty square tower which from its use was called the  Clock Tower  This may be seen in  Hollar  's print N  o  and in the old plan of  London  as it was in the beginning of the reign of queen  Elizabeth  WESTMINSTERHALL  MANY parts of this antient palace exist to this day sunk into other uses Succeeding monarchs added much to it The great hall was built by  William Rufus  or possibly rebuilt a great hall being too necessary an appendage to a palace ever to have been  neglected The entrance into it from  New Palace Yard  was bounded on each side by towers  Kip  has given a view of it N  o    most magnificently ornamented with numbers of statues in rows above each other now lost or concealed by modern buildings a mutilated figure of an armed man supposed to have been one was discovered under the Exchequer staircase in  Carter  's antient sculptures N  o    The size may be estimated when we are told that  Henry  III entertained in this hall and other rooms six thousand poor men women and children on newyear's day It became ruinous before the reign of  Richard  II who rebuilt it in its present form in and in kept his  Christmas  in it with his characteristical magnificence Twentyeight oxen three hundred sheep and fowls without number were daily consumed The number of his guests each day were ten thousand We need not wonder then that  Richard  kept two thousand cooks They certainly were deeply learned in their profession witness  The Forme of Cury  compiled about by the master cooks of this luxurious monarch in which are preserved receits for the most exquisite dishes of the time This book was printed by the late worthy  Gustavus Brander  esq  with an excellent preface by that able antiquary the reverend Mr  Pegge  Mr  Brander  favored me with a copy but excepting a magician of  Laputa  could conjure up a few of  Richard  's cooks I despair of ever treating my brethren with a feast  à l'antique  THIS room exceeds in dimension any in  Europe  which is not supported by pillars its length is two hundred and seventy feet the breadth seventyfour Its height adds to its solemnity The  roof of timber most curiously constructed and of a fine species of  gothic  PARLEMENTS HELD IN IT  PARLEMENTS often sat in this hall In when in the reign of  Richard  II it was extremely ruinous he built a temporary room for his parlement formed with wood and covered with tiles It was open on all sides that the constituents might see every thing that was said and done and to secure freedom of debate he surrounded the house with four thousand  Cheshire  archers with bows bent and arrows nocked ready to shoot  Stow  's  Survaie    This fully answered the intent for every sacrifice was made to the royal pleasure  COURTS OF IUSTICE  COURTS of justice even in early times sat in this hall where monarchs themselves usually presided for which reason it was called  Curia Domini Regis  and one of the three now held in this hall is called the court of king'sbench The first chief justice was  Robert Le Brun  appointed by  Henry  III The judges of the courts were made knights bannerets and had materials given them for making most sumptuous habits for the occasion Among others they had for a cloak cxx bellies of  minever pure  i e the ermine which they retain to this day but I observe green to be the predominant color of their robes The judges in old times rode to court at first on mules but in the reign of queen  Mary  they changed those restive animals for easy pads  CHARLES I TRIED HERE  THE solemn trial of  Charles  I was held in this hall before a packed court of judicature during the intervals of this mockery of justice he was carried to the neighboring house belonging to Sir  Thomas Cotton  in which a room was fitted up by Mr  Kinnersley  a servant of the king's belonging to the wardrobe This was  the residence of his father Sir  Robert  the famous antiquary and owner of the noble collection of manuscripts which with great public spirit he got together and secured for ever to the use of his country They were at first kept in  Cottonhouse  which was purchased by the crown They were afterwards removed to another house in  Westminster  and finally deposited in the  British Museum  Let me add that the room in which the books were originally lodged had been the oratory of  Edward  the Confessor  THE house of lords is a room ornamented with the tapestry which records our victory over the  Spanish Armada  HOUSE OF LORDS  It was bespoke by the earl of  Nottingham  lord high admiral and commander in chief on the glorious day The design was drawn by  Cornelius Vroom  and the tapestry executed by  Francis Spiering Vroom  had a hundred pieces of gold for his labor The arras itself cost £ It was not put up till the year two years after the extinction of monarchy when the house of lords was used as a committeeroom for the house of commons The heads of the naval heroes who commanded on the glorious days form a matchless border round the work animating posterity to emulate their illustrious example  IN the  Prince  's chamber where his majesty puts on his robes when he comes to the house of lords is a curious old tapestry representing the birth of queen  Elizabeth Anne Bullen  in her bed an attendant on one side and a nurse with the child on the other The story is a little broken into by the loss of a piece of the  Arras  cut to make a passage for the door But beyond is  Henry  with his courtiers one of which seems dispatched to bring  back intelligence about the event On the south side of this room are three  gothic  windows  COURT OF REQUESTS  THE court of requests is a vast room modernized at present a mere walkingplace The outside of the south end shews the great antiquity of the building having in it two great round arches with zigzag mouldings our most antient species of architecture This court has its name because the  masters  of it here received the petitions of the subjects to the king in which they  requested  justice and the masters advised the suppliants how they were to proceed  Coke  's Inst iv c    THAT court of justice so tremendous in the  Tudor  and part of the  Stuart  reign the  Star Chamber  still keeps its name which was not taken from the  stars  with which its roof was said to have been painted which were obliterated even before the reign of queen  Elizabeth  but from the  Starra  From the  Hebrew Shetàr  or  Jewish  covenants which were deposited there by order of  Richard  I in chests under three locks No  starr  was allowed to be valid except found in those repositories here they remained till the banishment of the  Jews  by  Edward  I In the reigns of  Henry  VII and VIII a newmodelled court was erected here consisting of divers lords spiritual and temporal with two judges of the courts of common law with the intervention of a jury  Blackstone  book iv c  The powers of this court were so shamefully abused and made so subservient to the revenge of a ministry or the views of the crown as to be abolished by the reforming commons in the th of  Charles  II  See lord  Clarendon  's curious account of its abuse  Hist Rebel  book iii  to  the great joy of the whole nation The room is now called the  Painted Chamber  and is used as the place of conference between the lords and commons It makes a very poor appearance being hung with very antient  French  or  Arras  tapestry which by the names worked over the figures seems to relate to the  Trojan  war The windows are of the antient simple  gothic  On the north outside beyond the windows are many marks of recesses groins arms on the remains of some other room  NUMBERS of other great apartments are still preserved on each side of the entrance into  Westminsterhall  in the law court of exchequer and adjacent and the same in the money exchequer and the dutchy of  Lancaster  all these had been the parts of the antient palace  AT the foot of the staircase is a round pillar having on it the arms of  John Stafford  lord treasurer from to On the opposite part are the arms of  Ralph  lord  Botelar  of  Sudley  treasurer of the exchequer in  Mr  Carter  vol i tab i p    CLOSE to Mr  Waghorn  's coffeehouse in  Old Palace Yard  GUY FAUR'S CELLAR  is the vault or cellar in which the conspirators of lodged the barrels of gunpowder designed at one blow to annihilate the three estates of the realm in parlement assembled To this day the manner in which Providence directed the discovery is unknown The plot evidently was confined to a few persons of desperate zeal and wickedness they did not dare to trust so dreadful a design to the multitude The success they knew must be followed with a general insurrection and completion of their wishes The opportunity would have been too irresistible even to those  who in cool blood would have rejected with horror a plan so truly diabolical  HOUSE OF COMMONS ONCE ST STEPHEN'S CHAPEL  THE commons of  Great Britain  hold their assemblies in this place which was built by king  Stephen  and dedicated to his namesake the protomartyr It was beautifully rebuilt by  Edward  III in and by him made a collegiate church and a dean and twelve secular priests appointed  Newcourt  i  Soon after its surrender to  Edward  VI it was applied to its present use The revenues at that period were not less than £ a year  WEST FRONT  THE west front with its beautiful  gothic  window is still to be seen as we ascend the stairs to the court of requests it consists of the sharppointed species of  gothic  Between it and the lobby of the house is a small vestibule of the same sort of work and of great elegance At each end is a  gothic  door and one in the middle which is the passage into the lobby On the south side of the outmost wall of the chapel appear the marks of some great  gothic  windows with abutments between and beneath some lesser windows once of use to light an under chapel The inside of  St Stephen  's is adapted to the present use and plainly fitted up  SUBCHAPEL  THE under chapel had been a most beautiful building the far greater part is preserved but frittered into various divisions occupied principally by the passage from  Westminsterhall  to  Palace Yard  BUST OF CHARLES I  IN the passage stood the famous bust of  Charles  I by  Bernini  made by him from a painting by  Vandyck  done for the purpose  CHARLES the  st    From an Original Bronze by Bernini From a Lecture by Vandyke  Bernini  is said by his skill in physiognomy to have pronounced from the likeness that there was something unfortunate in the countenance  THE far greater part of the underchapel of  St Stephen  is possessed by his grace the duke of  Newcastle  as auditor of the exchequer One side of the cloister is entirely preserved  BEAUTIFUL CLOISTER  by being found convenient as a passage the roof is  gothic  workmanship so elegant as not to be paralleled even by the beautiful workmanship in the chapel of  Henry  VII Several parts are walled up for the meanest uses even a portion serves with its rich roof for a coalhole That which has the good fortune to be allotted for the steward's room is very well kept In one part of the roof is cut a neat and I believe true representation of the front of the chapel bounded on each side by a turret Another of the same kind held by an angel appears on the wall  ON one side of the cloister  SMALL ORATORY AND CHAUNTRY  projects into the area a small oratory as richly ornamented as other parts of this building above is a neat chauntry in the same style A gallery runs over each side of the cloister with windows of light stone tracery looking into the court or area which is deformed by a modern kitchen and its appendages  FROM one part of the gallery is a stairs  ANTIENT SQUARE TOWER  which leads to a very antient square tower of stone standing almost close to the side of  Westminsterhall  It probably was a belfry to hold the bells that roused the holy members of the chapel to prayer  IN what is called the grotto room  SCULPTURES OF ST STEPHEN  are fine remains of the roof and columns of this subchapel The roof is spread over with ribs of stone which rest on the numerous round pillars that compose the support The pillars are short the capitals round  and small with a neat foliage intervening In a circle on the roof is a martyrdom of  St Stephen  cut in stone In another circle is a representation of  St John  the  Evangelist  cast into a cauldron of boiling oil by command of the emperor  Domitian  WOOLSTAPLE  NOT far from  Westminsterhall  in  New Palace Yard  stood the staple of wool removed to  Westminster  and several other places in  England  in by  Edward  III These before had been kept in  Flanders  but this wise measure brought great wealth into the kingdom and a considerable addition to the royal revenue for the parlement in those days granted to the king a certain sum on every sack exported  Henry  VI had six woolhouses here which he granted to the dean and canons of  St Stephen  's  Strype  's  Stow  ii book vi p  The concourse of people which this removal of the woolstaple to  Westminster  occasioned caused this royal village to grow into a considerable town such is the superiority of commerce Part of the old gateway to the staple was in being as late as the year when it was pulled down to make room for the abutment of the new bridge  Anderson  's  Dict  i    WESTMINSTER BRIDGE  THE first stone of that noble structure was laid on  January  th by  Henry  earl of  Pembroke  a nobleman of whom Mr  Walpole  says none had a purer taste in architecture It was built after the design of Monsieur  Labelye  an ingenious architect a native of  France  The last stone was laid in  November  so that it was eight years and nine months in completing at the expence of £ Its length is feet the number of arches fourteen that in the center seventysix feet wide In this bridge grandeur and simplicity are united Fault has been  found with the great height of the balustrades which deny to the passengers a clear view of the noble expanse of water and the fine objects especially to the east which are scattered with no sparing hand I cannot agree with the happy thought of the  French  traveller  M  Grosley  's tour to  London  i  who assures us that the cause was to prevent the suicide to which the  English  have so strong a propensity particularly in the gloomy month of  November  for had they been low how few could resist the charming opportunity of springing over whereas at present the difficulty of climbing up these heights is so great that the poor hypochondriac has time to cool and desisting from his glorious purpose think proper to give his days their full length and end them like a good christian in his peaceful bed  THE tide has been known to rise at this bridge twentytwo feet  TIDE  much to the inconveniency of the inhabitants of the lower parts of  Westminster  for at such times their cellars are laid under water but its height depends much on the force and direction of the wind at the time of flood  BEYOND this palace to the north  CANON OR CHANNEL ROW  stood some streets and lanes by the waterside distinguished in older times by the residence of some of our nobility In  Canon Row  so named from being inhabited by the canons of the church but corrupted into  Channel Row  was the stately house built by the termagant  Anne Stanhope  wife to the protector  Somerset  whose dispute about some point of female precedency is said to have contributed in some degree to her husband's fall She left this house to her son  Edward  earl of  Hertford  Here  William  earl of  Derby  had in a fair mansion and  Henry Clinton  earl of  Lincoln  another and  in this row  Anne Clifford  tell us that on the first of  May  she was begotten by her most valiant father  George  earl of  Cumberland  on the body of her most virtuous mother  Margaret  daughter of  Francis  earl of  Bedford  Astonishing accuracy  IN this part of the town were some other houses of our nobility In the remote  Tothil street  stood the houses of lord  Grey  and of lord  Dacres  mentioned in  Norden  's map of  London  in and in  Lea  's map published in is the earl of  Lindesey  's house near  Old Palace Yard  of which I find no other account than that it was inhabited in by one of the  Dormers  earl of  Caernarvon  New view of  London  ii    PALACE OF WHITEHALL  IMMEDIATELY beyond these buildings began the vast palace of  Whitehall  It was originally built by  Hubert de Burgh  earl of  Kent  the great the persecuted justiciary of  England  in the reign of  Henry  III He bequeathed it to the Black Friars in  Holborn  and they disposed of it to  Walter de Grey  archbishop of  York  in It became for centuries the residence of the prelates of that see and was styled  Yorkhouse  In it  Wolsey  took his final leave of greatness The profusion of rich things hangings of cloth of gold and of silver thousands of pieces of fine  Holland  the quantities of plate even of pure gold which covered two great tables  See  Fiddes  's life of  Wolsey    all of which were seized by his cruel rapacious master are proofs of his amazing wealth splendor and pride  Henry  deigned to purchase the palace from his fallen servant the antient palace of  Westminster  having some time before suffered greatly by fire From this time it became the residence of our  princes till it was almost wholly destroyed by the same element in  HENRY had an uncommon composition his savage cruelty could not suppress his love of the arts his love of the arts could not soften his savage cruelty The prince who could with the utmost  sang froid  burn Catholics and Protestants take off the heads of the partners of his bed one day and celebrate new nuptials the next had notwithstanding a strong taste for refined pleasures He cultivated architecture and painting and invited from abroad artists of the first merit To  Holbein  was owing the most beautiful gate at  Whitehall  built with bricks of two colors  FINE GATE  glazed and disposed in a tesselated fashion The top as well as that of an elegant tower on each side were embattled On each front were four busts in baked clay in proper colors which resisted to the last every attack of the weather possibly the artificial stone revived in this century These I have been lately informed are preserved in a private hand This charming structure fell a sacrifice to conveniency within my memory as did another in built at the same time but of far inferior beauty  Both these gates are engraven in plates xviixviii of the  Vetusta Monumenta  published by the Society of Antiquariesand also by  Kip  The last blocked up the road to  Kingstreet  and was called  King'sgate Henry  built it as a passage to the park the tenniscourt bowlinggreen the cockpit and tiltingyard for he was extremely fond of athletic exercises they suited his strength and his temper  IT was the intention of  William  duke of  Cumberland  to rebuild the beautiful gate first mentioned at the top of the long  walk at  Windsor  and for that purpose had all the parts and stones numbered but unfortunately the design was never executed  TILTYARD  THE tiltyard was equally the delight of his daughter  Elizabeth  as singular a composition for with the truest patriotism and most distinguished abilities were interwoven the greatest vanity  VANITY OF QUEEN ELIZABETH  and most romantic disposition Here in her sixtysixth year with wrinkled face red perriwig little eyes hooked nose skinny lips and black teeth  Hentzner  's Travels in vol i Fugitive Pieces p  she could suck in the gross flatterie of her favored courtiers  Essex  by his squire here told her of her  beauty  and worth A  Dutch  ambassador assured her majesty that he had undertaken the voyage to see her majesty who for  beauty  and wisdom excelled all other  beauties  in the world She labored at an audience to make  Melvil  acknowlege that his charming mistress was inferior in beauty to herself  Memoirs    The artful  Scot  evaded her question She put on a new habit of every foreign nation each day of audience to attract his admiration So fond was she of dress that three thousand different habits were found in her wardrobe after her death Mortifying reflection in finding such alloy in the greatest characters  SHE was very fond of dancing I admire the humour she shewed in using this exercise whenever a messenger came to her from her successor  James  VI of  Scotland  for Sir  Roger Aston  assures us that whenever he was to deliver any letters to her from his master on lifting up of the hangings he was sure to find her dancing to a little fiddle affectedly that he might tell  James  by  her youthful disposition how unlikely he was to come to the throne he so much thirsted after  Weldon  's Court of King  James      HENTZNER who visited this palace in  HER LIBRARY  informs us that her royal library was well stored with  Greek Italian Latin  and  French  books Among others was a little one in her own handwriting addressed to her father She wrote a most exceeding fair hand witness the beautiful little prayer book sold at the late dutchess of  Portland  's sale for £ written in five languages  HER LEARNING  two in  English  and one in  Greek Latin French  and  Italian  At the beginning was a miniature of her lover the  Duc d'Anjou  at the end one of herself both by  Hilliard  by the first she artfully insinuated that he was the primary object of her devotions His mother  Catherine de Medicis  had been told by an astrologer that all her sons were to become monarchs  Anjou  visited  England  and was received with every species of coquetry On the first of  January  in the tiltyard of this palace  GREAT TOURNAMENT HELD IN HONOR OF THE DUC D'ANJOU  the most sumptuous tournament ever celebrated was held here in honor to the commissioners sent from  France  to propose the marriage A banquetinghouse most superbly ornamented was erected at the expence of above a thousand seven hundred pounds  The gallerie adjoining to her majesties house at  Whitehall  says the minute  Holinshed  whereat hir person should be placed was called  ROMANTIC FOOLERIES  and not without cause the castell or fortresse of  perfect beautie  Her majesty at the time aged fortyeight received every flattery that the charms of fifteen could clame  This fortresse of perfect  beautie  was assailed by  Desire  and his four foster children  The combatants on both sides were persons of the first  rank a regular summons was first sent to the possessor of the castell with the  delectable  song of which this is part  "Yeeld yeeld ô yeeld you that this fort d  o hold  "Which seated is in spotless honors feeld  "  Desires  great force no forces can with hold  "Then to  Desires  desire ô yeeld ô yeeld"  Which ended  two canons were fird off one with sweet powder and the other with sweet water and after there were store of prettie scaling ladders and then the footmen threw floures and such fansies against the wals with all such devises as might seeme fit shot for  Desire  In the end  Desire  is repulsed and forced to make submission and thus ended an amorous foolery which if the reader is endowed with more patience than myself he may find to fill near six great pages in the historian aforesaid  From p to p    NOBLE BAND OF KNIGHTS TILTERS  TWO principal heroes of the time were Sir  Henry Lee  knight of the garter the faithful devoted knight of this romantic princess  SIR HENRY LEE THE QUEEN'S CHAMPION  and  George  earl of  Cumberland  The first had made a vow to present himself armed at the  TiltYard  on the th of  November  annually till he was disabled by age This gave rise to the annual exercises of arms during the reign The society consisted of twentyfive of the most distinguished personages about the court  The list is given in the Appendix  Among them was Sir  Christopher Hatton  and even the lord chancellor  DISABLED BY AGE RESIGNS IN GREAT FORM  I think Sir  Thomas Bromley  Age overtook Sir  Henry  in the thirtythird year of her majesty when he retired with great ceremony and recommended as his successor the famous  hero the earl of  Cumberland  of whom I have given an ample account in another place  Tour in  Scotland  vol ii  Sir  Henry  in the year invested his successor with much form and in the true spirit of chivalry and romance in the presence of the queen and the whole court armed the new champion and mounted him upon his horse His own armour he offered at the foot of a crowned pillar near her majesty's feet after which he clothed himself in a coat of black velvet pointed under the arm and instead of a helmet covered his head with a buttoned cap of the country fashion  See Mr  Walpole  's Miscellaneous Antiquities N  o  p  He died aged in the year and was interred in the once elegant little church of  Quarendon  near  Aylesbury  It is difficult to say whether that or the tomb is most ruinous The figure of the knight appears in armour reclining with one hand supporting his head the other on his sword on his neck is a rich collar with the  George  pendant his hair is short and curled his face bearded and whiskered He lies beneath a rich canopy supported by suits of armour like antient trophies The epitaph tell us  The warres abroad with honnor he did passe  In courtlie justs his sovereigns knight he was  Sixe princes he did serve  In a work which furnished so few architectural subjects for the engraver I present the reader with the portrait of this venerable knight taken from an original in possession of the late Mrs  Sydney Lee  of  Chester  who with great politeness obliged me with a reduced copy He was sprung from a  Cheshire  family the same which produced the  Lees  earls of  Lichfield  Sir  Henry  has by  him a large dog to which he once was indebted for his life By accident it was left one night in his bedchamber unknown to a faithless servant who entered the room with an intent to rob and murder his master but was seized on his entrance by the affectionate animal  THE other print is one of Sir  Henry  's associates in the gallant society  Robert  earl of  Leicester  clad for the tiltyard in complete armour  The knights of this gallant band were drawn at the time in their proper armour The book was in possession of the late dutchess dowager of  Portland  who with her usual condescension and friendship permitted me to have any copies I chose    OTHER AMUSEMENTS OF ELIZABETH  Rowland White  has left us a curious account of the amusements of this reign and with what spirit her majesty pursued her pleasures as late as her sixtyseventh year  Her majesty says she is very well This day she appoints a  Frenchman  to doe feate  upon a rope in the conduit court Tomorrow she hath commanded the beares the bull and the ape to be bayted in the tiltyard Upon  Wednesday  she will have solemne dawncing  Sydney  's State Papers i    ORIGIN OF THE PRESENT BANQUETTING HOUSE  IN the time of  James  I  Whitehall  was in a most ruinous state He determined to rebuild it in a very princely manner and worthy of the residence of the monarchs of the  British  empire He began with pulling down the banquetting rooms built by  Elizabeth  That which bears the name at present was begun in from a design of  Inigo Jones  in his purest manner and executed by  Nicholas Stone  mastermason and architect to the king it was finished in two years and cost seventeen thousand pounds but was only a small part of a vast plan left unexecuted by reason of  the unhappy times which succeeded The note  To  Inigo Jones  surveyor of the works done about the king's houses  s    d per diem  and £  per ann  for houserent a clerk and other incidental expencesMr  Walpole  will shew the small pay of this great architect  THE cieling of this noble room cannot be sufficiently admired It was painted by  Rubens  who had three thousand pounds for his work The subject is the  apotheosis  of  James  I it forms nine compartments one of the middle represents our pacific monarch on his earthly throne turning with horror from  Mars  and other of the discordant deities and as if it were giving himself up to the amiable goddess he always cultivated to her attendants Commerce and all the fine arts This fine performance is painted on canvass and is in fine preservation but a few years ago underwent a repair by Mr  Cipriani  who as I am told had two thousand pounds for his trouble Near the entrance is a bust of the royal founder  LITTLE did  James  think that he was erecting a pile from which his son was to step from the throne to the scaffold He had been brought in the morning of his death from  St James  's across the park and from thence to  Whitehall  where ascending the great staircase he passed through the long gallery to his bedchamber the place allotted to him to pass the little space before he received the fatal blow It is one of the lesser rooms marked with the letter A in the old plan of  Whitehall  He was from thence conducted along the galleries and the banquettinghouse through the wall in which a passage was broken  Herbert  's  Memoirs    Warwick  's  Memoirs    to his last  earthly stage This passage still remains at the north end of the room and is at present the door to a small additional building of late date At the time of the king's death contiguous to the banquettinghouse was a large building with a long roof and a small cupola rising out of the middle  Represented in one of  Hollar  's prints  The late dutchess of  Portland  did me the honor of shewing to me a rich pearl surmounted with a crown which was taken out of the ear of the murdered monarch after his head was struck off  This is figured in one of the private plates engraven at the expence of her grace    THE banquettinghouse has been many years past converted into a chapel  George  I appointed a salary of £ a year to he paid to certain select preachers to preach here every  Sunday  CABINET OF CHARLES I  THE collection of paintings formed by this most accomplished prince was esteemed the first in  Europe  They were kept in a room called the  Cabinetroom  in this palace which was built by order of prince  Henry  from a design of  Inigo Jones  I have a view of it and some of the antient parts of  Whitehall  which stood next to  St James  's park This building is distinguished by the  Venetian  window It stood on the fite of the duke of  York  's house  Vanderdort  was appointed keeper with a salary of £ a year On the death of  Henry  it was confirmed to him by  Charles  at the reduced salary of forty The view is taken from a drawing by  Levines  an artist who had worked under  Rembrandt  This I owe to the liberality of Doctor  Combes  THE pictures were sold by order of the ruling powers As a proof of his majesty's judgment in collecting several were sold  for a thousand pounds apiece a price seldom known in these days when money bears so far less a value  IN a complete plan of this great palace was taken by  John Fisher  and engraven by  Vertue  in  PLAN OF WHITEHALL  It appears that extended along the river and in front along the present  Parlement  and  Whitehall  street as far as  Scotland Yard  and on the other side of those streets to the turning into  Spring Garden  beyond the  Admiralty  looking into  St James  's  Park  The merry king his queen the royal brother prince  Rupert  the duke of  Monmouth  and all the great officers and all the courtly train had their lodgings within these walls and all the royal family had their different offices such as kitchens cellars pantries spiceries cyderhouse bakehouse woodyards and coalyards and slaughterhouse We see among the fair attendants of queen  Catherine  many names which make a great figure in  Grammont  and other chronicles of the time such as the countess of  Castlemaine  Mrs  Kirk  and Mrs  Killegrew  As to  Nell Gwynne  NELL GWYNNE  not having the honor to be on the good queen's establishment she was obliged to keep her distance at her house in what was then called  Pallmall  It is the first good one on the left hand of  St James  's  Square  as we enter from  Pallmall  The back room on the ground floor was within memory entirely of looking glass as was said to have been the cieling Over the chimney was her picture and that of her sister was in a third room At the period I mention this house was the property of  Thomas Brand  esq  of the  Hoo  in  Hertsordshire  THE other royal favorites had the sanction of offices such as maids of honor and the like which in all ages like charity were sure to cover a multitude of sins  I MUST not omit that from the palace into the  Thames  were two stairs one public the other the privy stairs for the use of majesty alone the first is still in use the other is made up in the old wall adjacent to the earl of  Fife  's but the arch of the portal remains entire  Henry  and his daughter  Elizabeth  made all their parties by water or on horseback or now and then the last went mounted on a litter carried on men's shoulders Coaches had been introduced into  England  by  Henry Fitzalan  earl of  Arundel  one of her admirers but the spirited princess seems to have disdained the use She rode in a dress of form and magnificence equal to what she appeared in at the drawingroom but never put on breeches or boots like the late  Czarina  nor yet the equivocal dress of the ladies of the present age  NO one is unacquainted with the noble and commodious improvements which succeeded The space occupied by the former palace most part of  Privy Garden  is covered with houses of nobility or gentry commanding most beautiful views of the river Among the first on the site of the smallbeer cellar of which a view is preserved in N  o  of  Hollar  's prints of  Whitehall  is the house of the earl of  Fife  EARL OF FIFE'S  From his judicious embankment is a matchless view of its kind of the two bridges with the magnificent expanse of water  Somersethouse St Paul  's and multitudes of other objects less magnificent but which serve to complete the beautiful scene  IN the great room is some very fine  Gobelins  tapestry I never can sufficiently admire the expression of passions in two of the subjects the fine history of  Joseph  disclosing himself to his brethren and that of  Susanna  accused by the two elders Here are also great numbers of fine paintings by foreign masters but as I  OLD HORSE GUARDS  confine myself to those which relate to our own country I shall only mention a small threequarters of  Mary Stuart  with her child an infant standing on a table before her This beautiful performance is on white marble  A HEAD of  Charles  I when prince of  Wales  done in  Spain  when he was there in on his romantic expedition to court the  Infanta  It is supposed to have been the work of  Velasco  A PORTRAIT of  William  earl of  Pembroke  lord high chamberlain in the beginning of the reign of  Charles  I a small full length in black with his white rod in one hand his hat in the other standing in a room looking into a garden Such is the merit of this piece that notwithstanding it is supposed to have been the performance of  Jameson  the  Scotch Vandyck  yet it has been often attributed to that great  Flemish  painter  Mr  Walpole    IN the vacant part of  Privy Garden  is still to be seen a noble statue in brass of our abdicated monarch executed by  Grinling Gibbons  the year before he deserted his throne  THE horseguards had their stables in the place they occupy at this time but the present elegant building was erected in the reign of his late majesty after a design I think by  Vardy  I have given a print  From a painting in possession of the earl of  Hardwick  of the Horseguards as they were in the time of  Charles  II In it is the merry monarch and his dogs and in the back view the banquettinghouse one of the gates the present treasury in its antient state and the top of the cockpit  THE Admiraltyoffice stood originally in  Dukestreet Westminster  but in the reign of king  William  was removed to the present  spot to the house then called  Wallingfordhouse  I believe from its having been inhabited by the  Knollys  's viscounts  Wallingford  From the roof the pious  Usher  archbishop of  Armagh  then living here with the countess of  Peterborough  was prevaled on to take the last sight of his beloved master  Charles  I when brought on the scaffold before  Whitehall  He sunk at the horror of the sight and was carried in a swoon to his apartment  THE present Admiraltyoffice was rebuilt in the late reign it is a clumsy pile but properly veiled from the street by Mr  Adams  's handsome skreen  Mr  Walpole  PALACE FOR KINGS OF SCOTLAND  A LITTLE farther to the north stood in the place now occupied by  Scotlandyard  a magnificent palace built for the reception of the  Scottish  monarchs whenever they visited this capital It was originally given by king  Edgar  to king  Ken  for the humiliating purpose of his making to this place an annual journey for the purpose of doing homage for the kingdom of  Scotland  and in after times for  Cumberland  and  Huntingdon  and other fiefs of the crown Here  Margaret  widow of  James  V of  Scotland  and sister to  Henry  VIII resided for a considerable time after the death of her husband and was entertained with great magnificence by her royal brother as soon as he was reconciled to her second marriage with the earl of  Angus  CHARINGCROSS  A LITTLE above stood one of the celebrated memorials of the affection of  Edward  I for his beloved  Elianor  being the cross erected on the last spot on which the body rested in the way to the abby the place of sepulture This and all the others were built after the designs of  Cavalini  This was destroyed by the religious  fury of the reformers From a drawing communicated to me by Doctor  Combes  it appears to have been of an octagonal form and in an upper stage ornamented with eight figures but the  gothic  parts far from being rich  THE cross was in the next century replaced by a most beautiful and animated equestrian statue in brass  FINE STATUE OF CHARLES I  of  Charles  I cast in by  Le Soeur  It was not erected till the year when the parlement had ordered it to be sold and broke to pieces but  John River  the brazier who purchased it having more taste or more loyalty than his masters buried it unmutilated and shewed to them some broken pieces of brass in token of his obedience M  d' Archenholz  gives a diverting anecdote of this brazier that he cast a vast number of handles of knives and forks in brass which he sold as made of the broken statue They were bought with great eagerness by the loyalists from affection to their monarch by the rebels as a mark of triumph over the murdered sovereign  See M  Archenholz  's  Tableau d' Angleterre  i    ON the site of part of  Northumberlandhouse  ST MARY ROUNCEVAL  stood the chapel of  St Mary Rounceval  a cell to the priory of  Rouncevaux  in  Navarre  It was founded by  William Marshal  earl of  Pembroke  in the time of  Henry  III It was suppressed by  Henry  V among the alien priories but rebuilt by  Edward  IV who fixed a fraternity in it  Newcourt  i  In the reign of  Edward  VI a grant was made of the site to Sir  Thomas Cawarden  Tanner    NOT far from hence opposite to  CharingCross  was an hermitage  with a chapel dedicated to  St Catherine  Stowe  's  Survaie    This in belonged to the see of  Llandaff  for I find in that year that  William de Radnor  then bishop had leave from the king to lodge in the cloister of his hermitage at  Charing  whenever he came to  London  Willis  's  Landaff      ON the north side of  CharingCross  stand the royal stables called from the original use of the buildings on their site the  Mews  having been used for keeping the king's falcons at lest from the time of  Richard  II In that reign the accomplished Sir  Simon Burley  knight of the garter was keeper of the king's falcons at the  Meuse  near  CharingCross  This office was by  Charles  II granted to his son by  Nell Gwyn Charles  duke of  St Albans  and the heirs male of his body In the reign of  Henry  VIII the king's horses were kept here In an accident by fire destroyed the building with a great quantity of hay and several great horses It was rebuilt in the reigns of  Edward  VI and queen  Mary  In the year the present handsome edifice arose  ST JAMES'S PALACE  ST JAMES's palace was originally a hospital founded and dedicated to  St James  by some pious citizens before the Conquest for fourteen leprous females and eight brethren were added afterwards to perform divine service On the quarrel between the great earl of  Warwick  and lord  Cromwel  about the cause of the first battle of  St Albans  lord  Cromwel  fearing the rage of that violent peer was at his own desire lodged here by way of security by  John Talbot  earl of  Shrewsbury  at that time lord treasurer of  England  Fenn  's Letters i  It was surrendered to  Henry  VIII in  who sounded on its site the present palace which  Stowe  calls a goodly manor His majesty also inclosed the park which was subservient to the amusement of this and the palace of  Whitehall Charles  II was particularly fond of it planted the avenues made the canal and the aviary adjacent to the  Birdcage walk  which took its name from the cages which were hung in the trees  Charles  says  Cibber  was often seen here amidst crowds of spectators feeding his ducks and playing with his dogs  Apology for the life of  Colley Cibber    and passing his idle moments in affability even to the meanest of his subjects which made him to be adored by the common people so fascinating in the great are the habits of condescension  DUCK ISLAND was erected into a government and had a salary annexed to the office in favor of  M St Evremond  who was the first and perhaps the last governor  S Pegge  esq  and the island itself is lost in the late improvements  IT does not appear that the palace was inhabited by any of our monarchs till after the fire at  Whitehall James  I presented it to his accomplished son  Henry  who resided here till his lamented death in  Charles  I was brought here from  Windsor  on  January  th  Whitelock  by the power of the army which had determined on his death his apartment was hastily furnished by his servant Mr  Kinnersley  of the wardrobe  Herbert  's Memoirs  Some of the eleven days which he was permitted to live were spent in  Westminsterhall  and of the nights in the house of Sir  Robert Cotton  adjacent to his place of trial On the th he was carried back to  St James  's where he passed his three last days in exemplary piety On the th he  was brought to the place of execution and walked unmoved at every insult with a firm and quick pace supported by the most lively sentiments of religion  HIS son the bigoted  James  sent to the prince of  Orange  when he had approached in force near to the capital a most necessitated invitation to take his lodgings at this palace The prince accepted it but at the same time hinted to the frightened prince that he must leave  Whitehall  It was customary to mount guard at both the palaces The old hero lord  Craven  was on duty at the time when the  Dutch  guards were marching through the park to relieve by order of their master From a point of honor he had determined not to quit his station and was preparing to maintain his post but receiving the command of his sovereign he reluctantly withdrew his party and marched away with sullen dignity  Dalrymple  's Memoirs    DURING the reign of king  William St James's  was fitted up for the residence of the princess  Anne  afterwards queen and her spouse prince  George  of  Denmark  From that time to the present it has been regularly the court of our monarchs  JAMES the son of  James  II who so long made pretensions to the  British  throne was born in the room now called the old bedchamber at present the antichamber to the levee room The bed stood close to the door of a backstairs which descended to an inner court It certainly was very convenient to carry on any secret design and might favor the silly warmingpan story was not the bed surrounded by twenty of the privycouncil four other men of rank twenty ladies besides pages and other attendants  James  with imprudent pride neglected to disprove the tale it was adopted by party and firmly believed by its zealots But as  James  proved false to his high trust and his son shewed every symptom of following his example there was certainly no such pretence wanting for excluding a family inimical to the interests of the GREAT WHOLE  UNCREDITABLE as the outside of  St James  's palace may look it is said to be the most commodious for regal parade of any in  Europe  Every one knows that the furniture of this palace is unbecoming the place  PORTRAITE  Yet in a ramble I once made through the apartments I saw several portraits of personages remarkable in their day Among others in one of the rooms behind the levee rooms is a small fulllength of  Henry  prince of  Wales  son of  James  I He is dressed in green standing over a dead stag and sheathing a sword A youth the accomplished lord  Harrington  of  Exton  is kneeling before him each of them have hunting horns and behind the prince is a horse and on the bough of a tree are the arms of  England  and behind the young lord another coat of arms perhaps his own Another fine small piece of  Arthur  elder brother to  Henry  VIII painted very young with a bonnet on his head  Henry  stands by him and his sister  Margaret  of infant ages This picture is by  Mabuse  who visited  England  in the reign of their father  HENRY VII and VIII fulllengths and each of them with a queen before an altar The fortunate  Jane Seymour  who died in her bed is the consort of the son here represented This is a copy from  Holbein  in small by  Van Lemput  n taken by order of  Charles  II The original was painted on the wall in the privy chamber of  Whitehall  and destroyed in the fire of  Two halflengths by  Lely  of the dutchess of  York  and her sister  A CHILD in the robes of the garter perhaps the youngest knight known He was the second son of  James  II while duke of  York  by  Anne Hyde  his dutchess On  December  d he was elected knight of the garter at the age of three years and five months The sovereign put the  George  round his neck and prince  Rupert  the garter round his little leg Death in the following year prevented his installation  Sandford      THE diminutive manhood of the dwarf  Geoffry Hudson  is to be seen in another picture He appears less by being placed walking under some very tall trees  IN the lords old waitingroom is  Henry Darnley  in black tall and genteel His hand is resting on his brother  Charles Stuart  earl of  Lenox  dressed in a black gown  IN another room is  Charles  II of  Spain  at the age of four in black with a sceptre in his hand strutting and playing the monarch He was inaugurated in His reign was unhappy  Spain  at no period was in so low so distressful a condition His dominions were parcelled out in his lifetime but he disappointed the allies and after some struggle the designation of his will in favor of the house of  Bourbon  took place  HERE is to be seen the famous picture by  Mabuse  of  Adam  and  Eve  Mr  Evelyn  justly remarks the absurdity of painting them with navels and a fountain with rich imagery amidst the beauteous wilds of paradise  Raphael  and  Michael Angelo  made  the same mistake of the navel on which the learned Sir  Thomas Brown  Vulgar Errors  p  wastes a long page and a half to disprove the possibility  IN the queen's library built by queen  Caroline  QUEEN'S LIBRARY  and ornamented by  Kent  now a lumberroom I saw a beautiful view from  Greenwich  park with  Charles  I his queen and a number of courtiers walking And two others of the same prince and his queen dining in public And another of the elector palatine and his spouse at public table with a carver looking most ridiculous a monkey having in that moment reared from the board and seized on his beard Possibly this feast was at  Guildhall  where he was most nobly entertained by the hospitable city in when he made the match with the daughter of our monarch which ended so unhappily for both parties  TO the east of  St James  's palace in the reign of queen  Anne  MARLBOROUGHHOUSE  was built  Marlboroughhouse  at the expence of the public It appears by one of  Kip  's views of  St James  's published before the existence of this house that it was built in part of the royal gardens granted for that purpose by her majesty The present duke added an upper story and improved the ground floor which originally wanted the great room This national compliment cost not less than forty thousand pounds  IN  Pallmall  the duke  Schomberg  had his house  PALLMALL  It was in my time possessed by  Astley  the painter who divided it into three and most whimsically fitted up the center for his own use  TO take a review of the space between this palace and  CharingCross  as it was about the year it will appear a tract of  fields there were no houses excepting three or four on the east side of the present  Pallmall  and a little farther on the opposite side a small church the name of which I cannot discover  BY the year  Cockspurstreet  filled up the space between those houses and  CharingCross Pallmall  was also laid out as a walk or a place for the exercise of the  Mall  a game long since disused The north side was also planted with a row of trees On the other side was the wall of  St James  's park  Charles  II removed it to its present place planted the park and made all those improvements which we now see It was  Le Notre  the famous  French  gardener the director of taste under  Louis  XIV who ordered the disposition of the trees Of late the  French  have endeavoured to borrow taste from us In the days of  Charles  HAYMARKET HEDGELANE  the  Haymarket  and  Hedgelane  had names but they were literally lanes bounded by hedges and all beyond to the north east and west was entirely country In the fine plan of  London  published by  Faithorn  in no traces of houses are to be met with in the former any more than a single one named the  Gaminghouse  at the end next to  Piccadilly Windmillstreet  consisted of disjoined houses and a windmill standing in a field on the west side proves from what its name was derived All the space occupied by the streets radiating from the  Seven Dials  was at that period open ground  LEICESTERHOUSE  Leicesterfields  was also unbuilt but the house of that name is found in the same plan and on the site of the present It was founded by one of the  Sydnies  earls of  Leicester  It was for a short time the residence of  Elizabeth  daughter of  James  I the titular queen of  Bohemia  who on  February  th here  ended her unfortunate life  Sandford    It has been tenanted for a great number of years It was successively the poutingplace of princes The late king when prince of  Wales  after he had quarrelled with his father lived here several years His son  Frederick  followed his example succeeded him in his house and in it finished his days No one is ignorant of the magnificent and instructive museum exhibited in this house by the late Sir ASHTON LEVER It was the most astonishing collection of the subject of natural history ever collected in so short a space by any individual To the disgrace of our kingdom after the first burst of wonder was over it became neglected and when it was offered to the public by the chance of a guinea lottery only eight thousand out of thirtysix thousand tickets were sold Finally the capricious goddess frowned on the spirited possessor of such a number of tickets and transferred the treasure to the possessor of only two Mr  Parkinson  who by his spirited attention to and elegant disposition of the  Museum  well merited the favor  BEHIND  Leicesterhouse  stood in the Militaryyard  THE MILITARY YARD  founded by  Henry  prince of  Wales  the spirited son of our peaceful  James  M  Foubert  afterwards kept here his academy for riding and other gentlemanlike exercises in the reign of  Charles  II It is to this day a noted ridingschool  A LITTLE beyond stood  Gerardhouse  GERARDHOUSE  the habitation of the gallant  Gerard  earl of  Macclesfield  See Journey to  London  It is lost in the street of the same name The profligate lord  Mohun  lived in this street and was brought there after he was killed in the duel with the duke  of  Hamilton  I have heard that his good lady was vastly displeased at the bloody corse being flung upon the best bed  COVENTRYHOUSE stood near the end of the  Haymarket  and gave name to  Coventrystreet  It was the residence of lord keeper  Coventry  and  Henry Coventry  secretary of state died here in This house is said to be on the site of one called in the old plans of  London  the  Gaminghouse  PICCADILLY  LORD  Clarendon  mentions a house of this name in the following words  Mr  Hyde  says he speaking of himself going to a house called  Piccadilly  which was a fair house for entertainment and gaming with handsome gravelwalks with shade and where were an upper and lower bowlinggreen whither very many of the nobility and gentry of the best quality resorted for exercise and conversation  Clarendon  's Hist  Oxford  ed i  sub  anno    AT the upper end of the  Haymarket  stood  Piccadillahall  where  Piccadillas  or  Turnovers  were sold which gave name to that vast street called from that circumstance  Piccadilly  This street was completed in as far as the present  Berkeleystreet  The first good house which was built in it was  Burlingtonhouse  the noble founder father to the late earl of  Burlington  said he placed it there  because he was certain no one would build beyond him  Nobody is ignorant of the vast town that since that period has extended itself beyond this palace After this rose  Clargeshouse  and two others adjacent inhabited says  Strype  by lord  Sherbourne  and the countess of  Denby  THE  Pesthousefields  were surrounded with buildings before the year but remained a dirty waste till of late years when  Carnabymarket  occupied much of the west part  Goldensquare  of dirty access was built after the Revolution or before In these fields had been the  lazareto  during the period of the dreadful plague of the year It was built by that true hero lord  Craven  who stayed in  London  during the whole time and braved the fury of the pestilence with the same coolness as he fought the battles of his beloved mistress  Elizabeth  titular queen of  Bohemia  or mounted the tremendous breach at  Creutznach  He was the intrepid soldier the gallant lover the genuine patriot  IN  Bondstreet  was built no farther than the west end of  Cliffordstreet New Bondstreet  was at that time an open field called  Conduit Mead  from one of the conduits which supplied this part of the town with water and  Conduitstreet  received its name for the same reason  GEORGE  street Hanoversquare  and its church rose about the same time The church was built by  John James  ST GEORGE's HANOVERSQUARE  and finished in Its portico would be thought handsome had you space to admire it It now looks  Brobdignagian  This was one of the fifty new churches and the parish stolen out of that of  St Martin in the Fields  It is the last parish in this part of  Westminster  excepting the distant  Marybonne  Every part besides was open ground covered with dunghills and all sorts of obscenity  May Fair  was kept about the spot now covered with  May Fair  chapel  MAY FAIR  and several fine streets The fair was attended with such disorders riots thefts and even murders that in it was presented by the magistrates It revived again and I remember the last celebrations the place was covered with booths temporary theatres and every enticement to low pleasure  AT the time of Sir  Thomas Wiat  's insurrection in  February  part of the army marched to make their attack on  London  over this tract then an open country as far as  CharingCross  On the spot called  Hayhill  near the present  Berkeleysquare  there was a skirmish between a party of the insurgents and another of the royal army in which the former were repulsed After the execution of Sir  Thomas  his head on that account was set up on a gallows at that place  Strype  's Memorials iii  and his parboiled quarters in different parts of the neighborhood of the capital Three of the insurgents were also hung in chains near the head of their leader  THIS extensive tract at present a vast seat of the most elegant population is far from being destitute of places of devotion but chapels arose instead of churches subordinate to their respective rectors In this enlightened age it was quickly discovered that "Godliness was profitable to many" The projector the architect the mason the carpenter and the plasterer united their powers A chapel was erected wellpewed wellwarmed dedicated and consecrated A captivating preacher is provided the pews are filled and the good undertakers amply repayed by the pious tenantry  HANOVER AND CAVENDISH SQUARES  IN  Hanoversquare  and  Cavendishsquare  were unbuilt but their names appear in the plans of  London  of  Oxfordstreet  from  Princesstreet  eastward as far as  Highstreet St Giles  's was almost unbuilt on the north side I remember there a deep hollow road and full of sloughs there was here and there a ragged house the lurkingplace of cutthroats insomuch that I never was taken that way by night in my hackneycoach to a  worthy uncle's who gave me lodgings at his house in  Georgestreet  but I went in dread the whole way The south side was built as far as  Swallowstreet  SOHOSQUARE was begun in the time of  Charles  II The duke of  Monmouth  lived in the center house facing the statue Originally the square was called in honor of him  Monmouthsquare  and afterwards changed to that of  Kingsquare  I have a tradition that on his  ath the admirers of that unfortunate man changed it to  Soho  being the word of the day at the field of  Sedgemoor  The house was purchased by the late lord  Bateman  and let by the present lord to the  Comte de Guerchy  the  French  ambassador After which it was leased on building leases The name of the unfortunate duke is still preserved in  Monmouthstreet  AFTER this digression let me return into  Piccadilly  BERKELEYHOUSE  Before the date of  Burlingtonhouse  was built a fine mansion belonging to the  Berkelies  lords and afterwards earls  Berkeley  It stood between the south end of  Berkeleysquare  and  Piccadilly  and gave name to the square and an adjacent street The misery and disgrace which the profligacy of one of the daughters brought on the house by an intrigue with her brotherinlaw lord  Grey  afterwards engaged in the  Monmouth  rebellion is too lastingly recorded in our  State Trials  ever to be buried in oblivion  ON the site of this house fronting  Piccadilly  DEVONSHIREHOUSE  stands  Devonshirehouse  long after the year it was the last house in this street at that time the portion of  Piccadilly  The old house which was built by the first duke was burnt in the reign of  George  II It was rebuilt by the third duke after a design by  Kent  Here is an excellent library and a very fine collection of medals I once saw the house by the favor of my friend the Reverend Doctor  Lort  at that time librarian to whose liberal communications I have been invariably indebted The portraits are so numerous in this noble house that I must leave the complete list to those who have more opportunities of forming it than I had Among others is a fine portrait of  Marc Antonio de Dominis  the vain desultory archbishop of  Spalato  who abjuring the  Roman  catholic religion came over to  England  and was appointed master of the  Savoy  He had not been here long but he publicly retracted all he had wrote against the church of  Rome James  ordered him to depart the kingdom in three days He had the folly to trust himself at  Rome  where his sincerity being doubted he was flung into prison where he ended his days He is painted by  Tintoret  represented in his study sitting in black and with a square cap  ARTHUR  Goodwin  the friend of Mr  Hampden  and like him active in the cause of liberty a fine full length by  Vandyck  in long hair his dress a yellow cloak and jacket and white boots  HIS daughter  Jane  second wife of  Philip  lord  Wharton  in black enriched with chains of gold  A HEAD of the favorite character of lord  Clarendon  the virtuous and accomplished lord  Falkland  SIR  Thomas Brown  author of the  Religio Medici  his lady and four daughters by  Dobson  Sir  Thomas  and his lady are in black one child is on her lap two stand before him on whom he looks with great affection When I thought of a passage in his famous book I could but smile at the number of children His sentiments on the consequence of matrimony are most singular I dare not quote the passage but must refer the reader to the strangeness of  his ideas on the subject  Religio Medici  part ii sect  Let it be remembered he was a bachelor when he wrote  THE delightful portrait of the  Jewish Rabbi  by  Rembrandt  A HEAD of  Titian  by himself And another of the painter  Carlo Cignani  also by himself  THE unfeeling  Philip  II by  Titian  a fulllength in armour enriched with gold The only time he ever buckled it on was when he shewed himself to his troops going on the assault of  St Quintin  He merited to be stripped of the honorable dress he never appeared in the field and carried on his wars like an assassin  I WILL close this very imperfect list with the famous countess of  Desmond  a popular subject with the painters and refer the reader to the account I have given of her in my visits to that worthy peer the late earl of  Kinnoul  in both my tours in  Scotland  THE collection of pictures by the great  Italian  masters is by far the finest private collection now in  England  THE house of that monster of treachery that profligate minister the earl of  Sunderland  who by his destructive advice premeditatedly brought ruin on his unsuspecting master  James  II stood on or near the site of the present  Melbournehouse  At the very time that he sold him to the prince of  Orange  he encouraged his majesty in every step which was certain of involving him and his family in utter ruin  PICCADILLY is continued near half a mile farther to the west  All the west part was originally called  Portugalstreet  the north side only consists of houses most of them mean buildings but it finishes handsomely with the magnificent new house  of lord  Bathurst  at  Hydepark corner  On the south side is the  Greenpark  bounded by a wall but in many places are rows of benevolent railings which afford a most elegant view of that park the trees in that of  St James  's the majestic venerable abby soaring far above and the more remote rural view of the  Surry  hills Beyond the  Turnpikehouse  stood the house of a noble celebrated by Mr  Pope  for his passion for dancing who demanded an audience from queen  Anne  after the death of  George  prince of  Denmark  to advise her majesty to dispel her grief by applying to that exercise  The sober  Lanesh  row  dancing in the gout  I have heard it said that this was only his  countryhouse  which might possibly have been at that time  ST GEORGE'S HOSPITAL  IN arose on its site that great charity  St George  's hospital founded by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants of  Westminster  The subscriptions in were £  s  but the benevolence of the governors or increase of accidents caused an increase of expence which threatened most serious consequences till the house was happily relieved by the bounty received from the third of the profits arising from the musical entertainments of the abbyThis hospital has discharged from it since it was opened on the first of the year not fewer than a hundred and sixtyfour thousand seven hundred and fortysix patients  HYDEPARK was in the late century and the early part of the present celebrated by all our dramatical poets for its large space railed off in form of a circle  THE RING  round which the  Beaumonde  drove in their carriages and in their rotation exchanging as they passed smiles and nods compliments or smart repartees  OPPOSITE to this hospital at  Hydepark Corner  stood a large fort with four bastions which formed one of the many flung up in the year It is incredible with what speed the citizens flung a rampart of earth all round the city and suburbs of  London  and again round  Southwark  and  Lambeth  strengthened with batteries and redoubts at proper intervals This was occasioned by an alarm of an attack from the royal army Men women and children assisted by thousands The active part which the fair sex took in the work is admirably described by the inimitable author of  Hudibras  who says he  March'd rank and file with drum and ensign  T' entrench the city for defence in  Rais'd rampiers with their own soft hands  To put the enemy to stands  From ladies down to oysterwenches  Labour'd like pioneers in trenches  Fal'n to their pickaxes and tools  And help'd the men to dig like moles  Have not the handmaids of the city  Chos'n of their members a committee  For raising of a common purse  Out of their wages to raise horse  And do they not as  Triers  fit  To judge what officers are fit  THERE were a few more great houses  BERKSHIRE OR CLEVELANDHOUSE  not remote from  St James  's palace which merit mention  Berkshirehouse  belonging to the  Howards  earls of  Berkshire  stood very near the royal residence It was afterwards purchased and presented by  Charles  II to that beautiful fury  Barbara  dutchess of  Cleveland  and its honorable name changed into that of her dishonored title It  was then of great extent She sold part which was built into various houses She built a large one for herself which still remains and may be distinguished by the row of round windows in the upper story  TARTHALL  TARTHALL stood near the present  Buckinghamgate  it was built in by  Nicholas Stone  for  Alathea  countess of  Arundel  wife to  Thomas  earl of  Arundel  After the death of the countess it became the property of her second son the unfortunate  William  lord  Stafford  a most gentle and amiable character who fell an innocent victim to the detestable violence of party and the perjured suborned evidence of the ever infamous  Oates Dugdale  and  Tuberville  Good men who had no share in that part hurried away by intemperate passion were at the period disgraced by their rage against this inoffensive peer Even the virtuous lord  Russel  committed in this cause the single opprobrium of his life when the unhappy lord was condemned RUSSEL could wish to deny the king the amiable prerogative of taking away the cruel the disgraceful part of the penalty Within three years this excellent man himself tasted the bitter cup but cleared by royal indulgence from the aggravating dregs with which he wished to agonize the dying moments of the devoted  Stafford  HERE were kept the poor remains of the  Arundelian  collection They were buried during the madness of the popish plot The mob would have mistaken the statues for popish saints They were sold in the year and the house soon after was pulled down Mr  Walpole  who saw the house at the time of the second sale informed me that it was very large and had a very venerable appearance  ARLINGTONHOUSE  HENRY BENNET earl of  Arlington  one of the famous Cabal  had a house near the site of the present  Buckinghamhouse  which went by his name It was afterwards purchased by  John Sheffield  duke of  Buckingham  who after obtaining an additional grant of land from the crown rebuilt it in a magnificent manner in  BUCKINGHAMHOUSE  He describes it most minutely as well as his manner of living there in a letter to the duke of  Shrewsbury  London  and its environs  He has omitted his constant visits to the noted gaminghouse at  Marybone  the place of assemblage of all the infamous sharpers of the time His grace always gave them a dinner at the conclusion of the season and his parting toast was  May as many of us as remain unhanged next spring meet here again  I remember the facetious  Quin  telling this story at  Bath  within the hearing of the late lord  Chesterfield  when his lordship was surrounded by a crowd of worthies of the same stamp with the above Lady  Mary Wortley  alludes to the amusement in this time  Some dukes at  Marybone  bowl time away  Antiently there was a park at  Marybone  for I find that in queen  Elizabeth  's time the  Russian  ambassadors were entertained with the amusement of hunting within its pale The duke died in His dutchess daughter to  James  II by  Catherine Sedley  lived here till her death She was succeeded by the duke's natural son  Charles Herbert Sheffield  on whom his grace had entailed it after the death of the young duke who died a minor It was purchased from Sir  Charles  by his present majesty is the retreat of our good king and queen and dignified with the title of the QUEEN'S HOUSE  The virtuous chancellor the earl of  Clarendon  CLARENDONHOUSE  had a house  facing the upper end of  St James  's  street  on the site of the present  Graftenstreet  It was built by himself with the stones intended for the rebuilding of  St Paul  's He purchased the materials but a nation soured with an unsuccessful war with fire and with pestilence imputed every thing as a crime to this great and envied character his enemies called it  Dunkirkhouse  calumniating him with having built it with the money arising from the sale of that town which had just before been given up to the  French  for a large sum by his master  Clarendon  was so sensible of his vanity of his imprudence in building so large a house and of the envy it drew upon him that he thinks fit to apologize for that act of his which he declares so far exceeded the proposed expence as to add greatly to the embarrassment of his affairs  Continuation of the life of the earl of  Clarendon  octavo vol iii p The house is engraven by  Dunstal  It cost fifty thousand pounds and three hundred men were employed in the building It was purchased from his lordship by  George M  k  duke of  Albemarle  and afterwards by another nobleman inferior indeed in abilities but not inferior in virtues In  ATTACK ON THE DUKE OF ORMOND BY BLOOD  James  duke of  Ormond  in his way to  Clarendonhouse  where his grace at that time lived was dragged out of his coach by the infamous  Blood  and his associates who intended to hang his grace at  Tyburn  in revenge for justice done under his administration in  Ireland  on some of their companions This refinement in revenge saved the duke's life he had leisure to disengage himself from the villain on horseback to whom he was tied by which time he was discovered by his affrighted domestics and rescued from death  Blood  was soon after taken in the attempt to steal the  crown The court had use for so complete a villain and sunk follow as to apply to his grace for pardon for the offence against him the duke granted it with a generous indignation  Blood  had a pension of five hundred a year and was constantly seen in the presencechamber as is supposed to shew to the great uncomplying men of the time what a ready instrument the ministry had to revenge any attempt that might be made against them in the cause of liberty  I WOULD not make this little work a  Tyburn  chronicle  MURDER OF MR THYNNE  yet I cannot omit the horrible assassination in of  Thomas Thynne  esq  of  Longleat  by the instigation of count  Koningsmark  in revenge for his having married lady  Elizabeth Ogle  the rich heiress on whom the count had a design The three assassins were executed in  Pallmall  on the bloody spot but the court in love with profligacy contrived to save the principal  Reresby  's Memoirs  The gallant  William  earl of  Devonshire  would have avenged the death of his friend the count accepted the challenge but his conscience prevented him from meeting the earl He afterwards met with a fate suited to his actions he attempted an intrigue in in  Germany  with a lady of distinguished rank he was one night waylayed by order of the jealous husband was literally cut to pieces and his remains flung into a privy which was instantly bricked up  JERMYN  JERMYNHOUSE  and  St Alban's  streets took their names from the gallant  Henry Jermyn  earl of  St Alban's  who had a house at the head of the last He was supposed to have been privately married to the queen dowager  Henrietta Maria  By this time misfortunes had subdued that spirit which had contributed to precipitate  her first husband into the ruin of his house She was awed by her subjectspouse  Reresby    her fear of him was long observed before the nearness of the connection was discovered  ST JAMES'S CHURCH  ON the ground of this gay peer was built the present church of  St James  founded in the latter part of the reign of  Charles  II and consecrated in the first of  James  II and named in honor of both saint and monarch  London  was so vastly increased about this period that a new church in this place was necessary Accordingly as much was taken from the parish of  St Martin in the Fields  as to form another It is a rectory to which at first the bishop of  London  had a right of two turns in the presentation Lord  Jermyn  nephew to the earl had the third but the last was fully resigned to the bishop  FINE FONT BY GIBBONS  The most remarkable thing in the church is the fine font of white marble the work of  Grinlin Gibbons  It is supported by the tree of life the serpent is offering the fruit to our first parents who stand beneath on one side of the font is engraven the  Baptist  baptizing our Saviour on another  St Philip  baptizing the eunuch and on the third  Noah  's ark with the dove bringing the olivebranch the type of peace to mankind  See this font engraven by  Vertue  tab iii of the  Vetusta Monumenta    THE chancel above the altar is enriched with some beautiful foliage in wood by the same great artist  THE STRAND ITS ANTIENT STATE  THE further progress of this part of the town I shall defer mentioning till I have reached the most eastern part of  Westminster  I shall resume my account at the opening of the  Strand  into  CharingCross  by observing that in the year that fine  street the  Strand  was an open highway with here and there a great man's house with gardens to the waterside In that year it was so ruinous that  Edward  III by an ordinance directed a tax to be raised upon wool leather wine and all goods carried to the staple at  Westminster  from  Templebar  to  Westminsterabbey  for the repair of the road and that all owners of houses adjacent to the highway should repair as much as lay before their doors Mention is also made of a bridge to be erected near the royal palace at  Westminster  for the conveniency of the said staple  Rymer  's  Foedera  v  but the last probably meant no more than a stairs for the landing of the goods which I find sometimes went by the name of a bridge  THERE are several instances of grants for building in this extensive road in very early times  Edward  I granted to  Walter le Barbur  a void space in the highstreet in the parish of  St Clement Danes  and  St Mary Strand  and  Robert le Spencer  had from the same prince another grant  THERE was no continued street here till about the year  THE STREET COMPLETED IN  before that it entirely cut off  Westminster  from  London  and nothing intervened except the scattered houses and a village which afterwards gave name to the whole  St Martin  's stood literally in the fields But about the year a street was formed loosely built for all the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river were called by their owners names and in aftertimes gave name to the several streets that succeeded them pointing down to the  Thames  each of them had stairs for the conveniency of taking boat of which many to this day bear the names of the houses As the court was for centuries either at the palace at  Westminster  or  Whitehall  a boat was the customary conveyance of the great to the presence of their sovereign The north side was a mere line of houses from  CharingCross  to  Templebar  all beyond was country The gardens which occupied part of the site of  Conventgarden  were bounded by fields and  St Giles  's was a distant country village These are circumstances proper to point out to shew the vast increase of our capital in little more than two centuries  IN the same century was a second epoch respecting the buildings of this part of the town The first was at the time we have mentioned or to speak from strong authority as they appear in the plan of  London  made about the year by  Ralph Aggas  See the plan of  London  as it was in the year published by  John Bowles  Our capital found itself so secure in the glorious government of  Elizabeth  that by the year most considerable additions were made to the north of the long line of street just described  St Martin'slane  was built on both sides  St Giles  's church was still insulated but  Broad street  and  Holborn  were completely formed into streets with houses all the way to  Snowhill Conventgarden  and  Lincoln'sinnfields  were built but in an irregular manner  Drurylane Clarestreet  and  Longacre  arose in the same period  NORTHUMBERLANDHOUSE  THE present magnificent palace  Northumberlandhouse  stands on the site of the hospital of  St Mary Rounceval Henry  VIII granted it to Sir  Thomas Caverden  It was afterwards transferred to  Henry Howard  earl of  Northampton  who in the time of  James  I built here a house and called it after his own name He left it to his kinsman the earl of  Suffolk  lord treasurer and by the  marriage of  Algernoon Percy  earl of  Northumberland  with  Elizabeth  daughter of  Theophilus  earl of  Suffolk  it passed into the house of the present noble owner The greater part of the house was built by  Bernard Jansen  an architect in the reign of  James  I the portal since altered by the late duke of  Northumberland  by a cotemporary architect  Gerard Christmas  who left on it his mark C Ae  Mr  Walpole  I must not omit that in this house is the noble picture of the  Cornaro  family by  Titian  It is very unfortunate that nothing can be more confined than the situation of this great house The noble front is pent up by a very narrow part of the  Strand  and behind by a cluster of mean houses coalwharfs and other offensive objects as far as the banks of the  Thames  Fortunately by the favor of government it enjoys the power of giving the place the most magnificent improvement The late duke received a lease from the crown of all the intervening ground as far as the river and within these very few years an absolute exchange for certain lands in  Northumberland  to erect batteries on against foreign invasion at the period when the project of universal fortification prevaled A little time may see every nusance removed and a terrace arise in their stead emulating that of  Somersethouse  A LITTLE farther is  Hungerford  stairs and market  HUNGERFORD STAIRS  which take their name from the great family of the  Hungerfords  of  Fairleigh  in  Wiltshire  Sir  Edward  created knight of the Bath at the coronation of  Charles  II had a large house on the site which he pulled down and multiplied into several others  ON the other side of the  Strand  ST MARTIN'S IN THE FIELDS  almost opposite to  Hungerfordmarket  stands the church of  St Martin in the Fields  once a parish of vast extent but much reduced at present by the robbing it of the tract now divided into the parishes of  St James St Anne  and  St Paul Coventgarden  We cannot trace the time of its foundation It was early bestowed on the abbot and convent of  St Peter Westminster  In there was a dispute between the abbot and the city of  London  about the jurisdiction of this church And in we first find the name of a vicar in room of  Thomas Skyn  who had resigned In the reign of  Henry  VIII a small church was built here at the king's expence by reason of the poverty of the parishioners who possibly were at that period very few In it was enlarged because of the increase of buildings In it was found necessary to take the whole down and in five years from that time this magnificent temple  It is engraven by  H Hulsebergh  was completed at the expence of near thirtyseven thousand pounds This seems the best performance of  Gibbs  the architect of the  Ratcliff Library  The steeple is far the most elegant of any of that style which I named the  Pepperbox  and with which I beg pardon of the good people of  Glasgow  I marked their boasted steeple of  St Andrew  YORKHOUSE  HEATH archbishop of  York  about the year purchased a house a little beyond  Hungerfordmarket  which had originally been the inn or lodgings of the bishops of  Norwich  When  Henry  VIII had dispossessed the primates of  York  of their house at  Whitehall  the daughter by way of reparation made to them a grant of  Suffolkhouse  in  Southwark  which he sold and with the  N  court  i  money purchased  Norwichhouse  which afterwards was called  Yorkhouse  when  George Villiers  duke of  Buckingham  became owner of it On his disposal of it several streets were laid out on the site and ground belonging to it These go under the general appellation of  Yorkbuildings  but his name and title is preserved in  George  YORKBUILDINGS  Villiers Duke  and  Buckingham  streets and even the particle  of  is not forgotten being preserved in  Ofalley  THE gate to  Yorkstairs  is the work of  Inigo Jones  and deserving of all the praises bestowed on it by the author of the Critical Review  DURHAMYARD takes its name from a palace  DURHAMPLACE  built originally by the illustrious  Thomas de Hatfield  elected bishop of  Durham  in designed by him for the town residence of him and his successors It was called  Durhamplace  i e palace Be it known to all whom it concerns that the word is only applicable to the habitations of princes or princely persons and that it is with all the impropriety of vanity bestowed on the houses of those who have luckily acquired money enough to pile on one another a greater quantity of stones or bricks than their neighbors  GREAT FEASTING HERE IN  At this place in was held a most magnificent feast given by the challengers of  England  who had caused to be proclamed in  France Flanders Scotland  and  Spain  a great and triumphant justing to be holden at  Westminster  for all comers that would undertake them But both challengers and defendants were  English  After the gallant sports of each day the challengers rode unto this  Durhamhouse  where they kept open household and feasted the king and queen  Anne  of  Cleves  with her ladies and all the court  In this time of their housekeeping they had not only feasted the king queen ladies and all the court as is aforeshewed  but also they cheered al the knights and burgesses of the common house in the parliament and entertained the maior of  London  with the aldermen and their wives at a dinner c The king gave to every of the sayd challengers and their heires for ever in reward of their valiant activity marks and a house to dwel in of yeerely revenue out of the lands pertaining to the hospital of  S John  of  Jerusalem  Stow  's  Survaie      IN this a  part of the following year is most strongly exemplified the unfeeling heart of this cruel prince His sudden transitions from nuptials and joyous festivities to the most tyrannical executions often for offences of his own creation In that small space of time he married one queen and put her away because he thought her a  Flanders  mare He espoused another and not without cause put her and the confident to her incontinence to death He caused to be executed a hopeful young peer and three young gentlemen for a common manslaughter resulting from a sudden fray He burnt numbers for denying the religion of  Rome  and inflicted all the barbarous penalties of high treason on multitudes for denying a prerogative which he had wrested from the pope the head of that very worship which he supported with such rigour  IN the reign of  Edward  VI the mint was established in this house under the management of Sir  William Sharrington  and the influence of the aspiring  Thomas Seymour  lord admiral Here he proposed to have money enough coined to accomplish his designs on the throne His practices were detected and he suffered death His tool was also condemned but sacrificing his master  to his own safety received a pardon and was again employed under the administration of  John Dudley  earl of  Northumberland  It afterwards became the residence of that ambitious man who in  May  in this palace caused to be solemnized with great magnificence three marriages his son lord  Guildford Dudley  with the amiable lady  Jane Grey  lord  Herbert  heir to the earl of  Pembroke  with  Catherine  younger sister of lady  Jane  and lord  Hastings  heir to the earl of  Huntingdon  with his youngest daughter lady  Catherine Dudley  Holinshed    From hence he dragged the reluctant victim his daughterinlaw to the  Tower  there to be invested with regal dignity  British Biog  iii p  In eight short months his ambition led the sweet innocent to the nuptial bed the throne and the scaffold  DURHAMHOUSE was reckoned one of the royal palaces belonging to queen  Elizabeth  who gave the use of it to the great Sir  Walter Raleigh  DURHAMYARD is now filled with a most magnificent mass of building called the  Adelphi  ADELPHI  in honor of two brothers its architects Before the front to the  Thames  is a terrace commanding a charming view to the river when not obscured by the damps and poisonous fogs which too often infest the air of the lower part of our capital  To the north of  Durhamplace  fronting the street  THE NEW EXCHANGE  stood the  New Exchange  which was built under the auspices of our monarch in The king queen and royal family honored the opening with their presence and named it  Britaines Bursse  It  was built somewhat on the model of the  Royal Exchange  with cellars beneath a walk above and rows of shops over that filled chiefly with milleners sempstresses and the like This was a fashionable place of resort In a fatal affair happened here Mr  Gerard  a young gentleman at that time engaged in a plot against  Cromwell  was amusing himself in the walk beneath when he was insulted by  Don Pantaleon de Saa  brother to the ambassador of  Portugal  who disliking the return he met with determined on revenge He came there the next day with a set of bravos who mistaking another gentleman for Mr  Gerard  instantly put him to death as he was walking with his sister in one hand and his mistress in the other  Don Pantaleon  was with impartial justice tried and condemned to the axe Mr  Gerard  who about the same time was detected in the conspiracy was likewise condemned to die By singular chance both the rivals suffered on the same scaffold within a few hours of each other Mr  Gerard  with intrepid dignity the  Portuguese  with all the pusillanimity of an assassin  Clarendon Whitelocke      THE WHITE MILLENER  ABOVE stairs sat in the character of a millener the reduced dutchess of  Tyrconnel  wife to  Richard Talbot  lord deputy of  Ireland  under  James  II a bigotted papist and fit instrument of the designs of the infatuated prince who had created him earl before his abdication and after that duke of  Tyrconnel  A female suspected to have been his dutchess after his death supported herself for a few days till she was known and otherwise provided for by the little trade of the place had delicacy enough to wish  not to be detected she sat in a white mask and a white dress and was known by the name of the  White Millener  THIS exchange has long since given way to a row of good houses which form a part of the street  A LITTLE beyond was  Ivy  bridge which crossed the  Strand  and had beneath it a way leading to the  Thames  This was the boundary between the liberties of the dutchy of  Lancaster  and those of  Westminster  Near this bridge the earls of  Rutland  had a house at which several of the noble family breathed their last The earls of  Worcester  had a very large house between  Durhamplace  and the  Savoy  with gardens to the waterside The great earl of  Clarendon  lived in it before his own was built and payed for it the extravagant rent of five hundred pounds a year This was pulled down by their descendant the duke of  Beaufort  and the present  Beaufortbuildings  rose on its site This had originally been the townhouse of the bishops of  Carlisle  Fuller  's Ch Hist book iii p  Opposite to these was the garden belonging to the abbot of  Westminster  which extended quite to  St Martin  's church it was called the  Convent Garden  and retains the name to this day It was granted after the dissolution by  Edward  VI first to the protector  Somerset  and afterwards to lord  Russel  created earl of  Bedford  About  Francis  earl of  Bedford  began to clear away the old buildings and formed the present handsome square The arcade and the church were the work of  Inigo Jones Bedfordhouse  the former townhouse of the noble family stood in the  Strand  but has long since given way to  Little Bedfordstreet  GREAT part of the palace called the  Savoy  is now standing  THE SAVOY  but  is little better than a military prison The palace of the potent  Simon de Montford  earl of  Leicester  stood on this place  Strype  's  Stow  ii book iv    Henry  III had granted to  Peter  of  Savoy  uncle to his queen  Elianor  daughter of  Berenger  of  Provence  all the houses upon the  Thames  where this building now stands to hold to him and his heirs yielding yearly at the exchequer three barbed arrows for all services This prince founded the  Savoy  and bestowed it on the fraternity of  Montjoy  Queen  Elianor  purchased it and bestowed it on her son  Edmund  earl of  Lancaster  It was rebuilt in a most magnificent manner by his son  Henry  It was made the place of confinement of  John  king of  France  in after he was taken prisoner at the battle of  Poitiers  In it was entirely destroyed by  Wat Tyler  out of spleen to the great owner  John  of  Gaunt Henry  VII began to rebuild it with a design of forming it into an hospital for a hundred distressed people He says in his will he intended by this foundation  to doo and execute vi out of the vii works of pitie and mercy by meanes of keping susteynyng and mayntenyng of commun hospitallis wherein if thei be duly kept the said nede pouer people bee lodged viseted in their sicknesses refresshed with mete and drinke and if nede be with clothe and also buried yf thei fourtune to die within the same for lack of theim infinite nombre of pouer nede people miserably daillie die no man putting hande of helpe or remedie  This building was in form of a cross the walls of which are entire to this time His son continued and completed the design The revenues at the suppression by  Edward  VI amounted to above five hundred pounds a year  Savoy Hospital  Queen  Mary  restored it and her maids of honor with exemplary piety furnished it with all necessaries It was again suppressed by queen  Elizabeth  and at present part serves as lodgings for private people for barracks and a scandalous infectious prison for the soldiery and for transports  HERE is besides the church of  St Mary le Savoy  CHURCH OF ST MARY LE SAVOY  It was originally the chapel to the hospital but was made parochial on the impious destruction of  St Mary le Strand  by the duke of  Somerset  The roof is remarkably fine flat and covered with elegant small compartments cut in wood and shields containing emblems of the passion surround each with a neat garland  AMONG the monuments in the chancel that in memory of the wife of Sir  Robert Douglas  merits notice The lady who died in is but a secondary figure and placed kneeling behind her husband dressed in a vast distended hood Before her is her husband in an easy attitude reclined and resting on his right arm the other hand on his sword He is represented in armour with a robe over it on his head a fillet with a bead round the edge a motto on his arms  Toujour sans taches  See the inscription in the New View of  London  ii She died in  The sculptor has much merit in this figure  IN a pretty  gothic  niche on the opposite side occupied probably in old times by the image of our lady is now the figure of a kneeling female with a countess's coronet on her head This commemorates  Jocosa  daughter of Sir  Alan Apsley  lieutenant of the  Tower  first wife to  Lyster Blunt  esq  and afterwards of  William Ramsay  earl of  Dalhousie  ANOTHER fine monument of a recumbent lady in a great ruff  and long gown with her arms cut on it attracts our notice but unfortunately the inscription is lost  BURLEIGH O  EXETER HOUSE  BURLEIGHHOUSE was said to have been a noble pile built by that great statesman the lord treasurer  Burleigh  who died here in It was built with brick and adorned with four square turrets It was afterwards called  Exeterhouse  from the title of his son and successor On its site was erected  Exeterexchange  It had been a very handsome pile with an arcade in front a gallery above and shops in both The plan did not succeed for the New Exchange had the preference and stole away both tenants and customers A part of the old house is still to be seen All originated in sacrilege On the site stood a house belonging to die parson of  St Martin  's Sir  Thomas Palmer  a creature of the duke of  Somerset  obtained it by composition in the time of  Edward  VI and began to build there a magnificent house of brick and timber  Stow's Survai      This afterwards came into the hands of lord  Burleigh  who finished it in the magnificent manner we have mentioned  WIMBLEDONHOUSE  A LITTLE farther where  Doyley  's warehouse now stands was  Wimbledonhouse  built by Sir  Edward Cecil  son to the first earl of  Exeter  and created by  Charles  I viscount  Wimbledon  NOT far from hence stood the  Strand Bridge  which crossed the street and received the water which ran from the high grounds through the present  Catherine street  and delivered it into the  Thames  OTHER ANTIENT BUILDINGS  ON the south side of the  Strand  stood a number of buildings which fell victims to sacrilege in the reign of  Edward  VI  St  Mary le Strand  was a very antient church and parish a rectory in the gift of the bishops of  Worcester  who had near it their inn or town residence The bishops of  Litchfield  and  Coventry  had another built by  Walter de Langton  elected bishop of that see in It was also called  Chester Inn  CHESTER INN  as that bishoprick was at the time annexed to the former The bishops of  Landaff  had also another house or inn Finally the  Strand Inn  an inn of Chancery belonging to the  Temple  Dugdale  's Origines Judiciales  I must stop a moment to say that  Occleve  the poet of the reign of  Henry  V studied the law here the place of his education is called  Chestres Inn  Mr  Thomas Warton  but as that was never appropriated to the study of the law I little doubt but it is a mistake for this adjacent house Every one of these were levelled to the ground by the protector  Somerset  to make way for the magnificent palace which bears his name  SOMERSETHOUSE  The architect is supposed to have been one  John  of  Padua  who had a salary in the preceding reign under the title of  devizor of his majesty's buildings  Anecdotes of Painting i  which was continued to him in the reign of the son No atonement was made no compensation to the owners Part of the church of  St John of Jerusalem  and the tower were blown up for the sake of the materials The cloisters on the north side of  St Paul  's underwent the same fate together with the charnelhouse and chapel the tombs were destroyed and the bones impiously carried away and flung into  Finsbury Fields  This was done in when the building was first began possibly the founder never enjoyed the use of this palace  for in he fell a just victim on the scaffold The crime of sacrilege is never mentioned among the numerous articles brought against him This is no wonder since every great man in those days protestant and papist shewed equal rapacity after the goods of the church  AFTER his death his palace fell to the crown Queen  Elizabeth  lived here at certain times most probably at the expence of her kinsman lord  Hunsdon  to whom she had given the use  Anne  of  Denmark  kept her court here and  Catherine  queen of  Charles  II lived here for some time in the life of her unfaithful spouse and after his death till she retired into her native country  ANTIENT B  ING  THE architecture of old  Somersethouse  was the mixture of  Grecian  and  Gothic  introduced into  England  in the reign preceding its erection The backfront and the watergate were built from a design of  Inigo Jones  after the year A chapel was begun by him in that year and afterwards finished It was intended for the use of his catholic spouse the  Infanta  of  Spain  but on the failure of that romantic match it served for the uses of the professors of her religion  AS  Charles  II did not find it compatible with his gallantries that his spouse  Catherine  should be resident at  Whitehall  he lodged her during some part of his reign in this palace This made it the haunt of the Catholics and possibly during the phrenetic rage of the nation at that period against the professors of her religion occasioned it to have been made the pretended scene of the murder of Sir  Edmonbury Godfrey  MURDER OF SIR EDMONBURY GODFREY  in the year The infamous witnesses against his supposed murderers declared that he was waylaid and inveigled into the palace under pretence  of keeping the peace between two servants who were fighting in the yard that he was there strangled his neck broke and his own sword run through his body that he was kept four days before they ventured to remove him at length his corpse was first carried in a sedanchair to  S  ho  and then on a horse to  Primrosehill  between  Kilburn  and  Hampstead  There it certainly was found transfixed with the sword and his money in his pocket and his rings on his fingers The murder therefore was not by robbers but the effect of private revenge but it is not probable that it was committed within these walls for the assassins would never have hazarded a discovery by carrying the corpse three miles when they could have so safely disposed of it into the  Thames  The abandoned characters of the evidences  Prance  and  Bedloe  the former of whom had been treated with most horrid cruelties to compel him to confess what he declared he never was guilty of together with the absurd and irreconcileable testimony they gave on the trial has made unprejudiced times to doubt the whole That he was murdered there is no doubt he had been an active magistrate and had made many enemies The marks of strangling round his throat and his broken neck evince the impossibility of his having put an end to his own existence as some have insinuated But the innocence of the three poor convicts would not avail the torrent of prejudice prevaling against them and they were executed denying the facts in the moment of death One was a Protestant the other two  Roman Catholics  and belonging to the chapel so probably were fixed on by the instigators of the accusation in order to involve the queen in the uncharitable suspicion  THIS tragedy became at the time the subject of many medals  See  Evelyn  's Medals  On one is the bust of Sir  Edmondbury  and two hands strangling him on the reverse the pope giving his benediction to a man strangling another on the ground On a second with the same bust is the representation of the carrying the magistrate on horseback to  Primrosehill  A third makes him walking with his broken neck and sword buried in his body and on the reverse  St Dennis  with his head in his hand with this inscription  GODFREY walks up hill after he was dead  DENIS walks down hill carrying his head  THE present magnificent building is after a design by Sir  William Chambers  when completed it is to be the station of numbers of our public offices The Navy Office and indeed almost every one excepting the Treasury the Secretary of State's the Admiralty and the War Office  THE Royal Society and the Society of Antiquarians hold their meetings here and here also are annually exhibited the works of the  British  painters and sculptors  THE terrace on the south side is a walk bounded by the  Thames  and unparalleled for grandeur and beauty of view  BATH'S INN  TO the east of  Somersethouse  stood  Bath's Inn  inhabited by the bishops of  Bath  and  Wells  in their visits to the capital It was wrested from them in the reign of  Edward  VI by lord  Thomas Seymour  high admiral and received the name of  Seymourplace  This was one of the scenes of his indecent dalliance with the princess  Elizabeth  afterwards queen At first he certainly  was not ill received notwithstanding he had just espoused the unhappy  Catherine Parre  Ambition not lust actuated this wretched man his designs on  Elizabeth  and consequently on the crown spurred him on The instrument of his design was  Thomas Parrye  cofferer to the princess to whom he offered for her grace's accommodation his house and all the furniture during her stay in  London  Burghley  's State Papers p  The queen's death and her own suspicions on her deathbed give just cause of the foulest surmises  Burghley  's State Papers p The whole of his infamous conduct in this affair is fully related from p to  His execution which soon followed put an end to his projects and saved  Elizabeth  and the nation from a tyrant possibly worse than him from whom they had been just released  THIS house in aftertimes passed to  Thomas Howard  earl of  Arundel  and was called  Arundel  palace The  Duc de Sully  ARUNDEL PALACE  who was lodged in it during his embassy to  England  on the accession of  James  I says it was one of the finest and most commodious of any in  London  from its great number of apartments on the same floor the views from the extensive gardens up and down the river were remarkably fine Here was kept the magnificent collection of statues formed by the earl Howsoever faulty the noble historian may have represented him in some respects his judgment in the fine arts will remain indisputable His relation the duke of  Norfolk  had a house at a very small distance from this Both were pulled down in the last century but their names are retained in the streets which rose on their sites  AFTER it came into the possession of the duke of  Norfolk  the  same who presented his library to the Royal Society he permitted that learned body to hold their meetings in  Arundelhouse  but on its being ordered to be pulled down the meetings were removed to  Gres  am  college  Memoirs of the  Howards  p    AN OLD CROSS  OPPOSITE to  Chester Inn  stood an antient cross According to the simplicity of the age in the year and at other times the judges sat without the city on this cross to administer justice and sometimes they made use of the bishop's house for that purpose  MAYPOLE  IN the beginning of the present century somewhat east of the site of the cross was the rural appearance of a  Maypole  In it fell to decay and the remainder was begged by Sir  Isaac Newton  who caused it to be carried to  Wansted  in  Essex  where it was erected in the park and had the honor of raising the greatest telescope then known On its place rose the first of the fifty new churches which is known by the name of the  New Church in the Strand  The first stone was laid in The architect was  Gills  who loaded it with ornaments to such a degree as to gain very little credit to his own taste or that of his employers  DRURYHOUSE  IN  Drurylane  which points towards the church stood  Druryhouse  the habitation of the great family of the  Druries  and I believe built by Sir  William Drury  knight of the Garter a most able commander in the  Irish  wars who unfortunately fell in a duel with Sir  John Boroughs  in a foolish quarrel about precedency  See  Kenne  's Hist ii  I cannot learn into whose hands it passed afterwards During the time of the fatal discontents of the favorite  Essex  it  was the place where his imprudent advisers resolved on such counsels as terminated in the destruction of him and his adherents  IN the next century we find the heroic  William  lord  Craven  AFTERWARDS CRAVENHOUSE  afterwards earl  Craven  possessed of this house he rebuilt it in the form we now see a large brick pile now concealed by other buildings It is at present a publichouse In searching after  Cravenhouse  I instantly knew it by the sign that of the queen of  Bohemia  's head his admired mistress whose battles he first fought animated by love and duty When he could aspire at her hand it is supposed he succceded it is said they were privately married and that he built for her the fine seat at  Hampstead Marshal  in the county of  Berks  which was destroyed by fire I have before given an account of this illustrious nobleman  Journey to  London  I may repeat the service he rendered to this his native city in particular He was so indefatigable in preventing the ravages of the frequent fires of those days that it was said that his very horse smelt it out He and the duke of  Albemarle  the noted  Monk  heroically stayed in town during the dreadful pestilence and at the hazard of their lives preserved order in the midst of the terrors of the time  IN the court in  Cravenbuildings  is a very good portrait of this hero in armour with a truncheon in his hand and mounted on his white horse on each side is an earl's and a baron's coronet and the letters W C It is painted  al fresco  and in good preservation  THE theatre royal in this street originated on the Restoration  The king made a grant of a patent for acting in what was then called the  Cockpit  and the  Phoenix  The actors were the king's servants were on the establishment and ten of them were called  Gentlemen of the Great Chamber  and had ten yards of scarlet cloth allowed them with a suitable quantity of lace  Cibber  's Apology    IT is singular that this lane of later times so notorious for intrigue should receive its title from a familyname which in the language of  Chaucer  had an amorous signification  Of bataille and of chevalrie  Of ladies love and  Druerie  Anon I wol you tell  IN this neighborhood towards the Temple are several little seminaries of law or inns of Chancery belonging to the Inner and Middle Temple such as  Lionsinn  in use as long at lest as the reign of  Henry  V the  Newinn  where the students of the  Strandinn  nestled after they were routed from thence by the duke of  Somerset  and  Clementsinn  mentioned in the time of  Edward  IV I must not omit that in  Newinn  the great Sir  Thomas More  had the early part of his education before he removed to  Lincoln'sinn  Dugdale  's Origines    CHURCH OF ST CLEMENT DANES  BETWEEN  Clementsinn  and the  Strand  is the church of  St Clement Danes  called so either from being the place of interment of  Harold the Barefooted  or of the massacre of certain  Danes  who had taken refuge there it was one of the churches built on this tract before the Conquest At the time of the insurrection of the unhappy earl of  Essex  a piece of artillery was placed on the  top of the tower which commanded  Essexhouse  The present was rebuilt in  Newcourt  i  Here beneath a tomb with his figure expressed in brass was buried  John Arundel  bishop of  Exeter  who died in at  Exeterhouse  the town residence of the bishops of  Exeter  EXETERHOUSE  It was founded by  Walter Stapleton  bishop of that see and lord treasurer of  England  unfortunately a favorite with  Edward  II in those factious days he was seized by the mob hurried to  Cheapside  where they beheaded him and carried his corpse before his own palace and there buried it beneath a heap of sand The house was said to have been very magnificent  Lacy  bishop of  Exeter  in the reign of  Henry  VI added a great hall The first lord  Paget  a good catholic made no scruple of laying violent hands on it in the grand period of plunder He improved it greatly and called it after his own name  PAGETHOUSE  At this house it was alleged that the great duke of  Somerset  designed the assassination of several of the council This involved the noble owner in his ruin In the reign of queen  Elizabeth  it was possessed by the great earl of  Leicester  and changed its name to  Leicesterhouse  LEICESTERHOUSE  The earl left it by will  Sydney  Papers i  to his soninlaw  Robert  earl of  Essex  the unfortunate imprudent favorite of  Elizabeth  and it was called after his name This was the scene of his frantic actions  ESSEXHOUSE  from hence he sallied on the vain hope of exciting the city to arm in his behalf against its sovereign to this place he forced his way back and after a short siege submitted and soon afterwards received his due punishment reluctantly inflicted by his mistress hesitating between fear and unseasonable love The memory of  these transactions is still retained in the name of  Essexstreet  and  Essexstairs  and  Devereuxcourt  In the last on the outside of a house is placed a bust of the parlement general son of the unfortunate favorite  TEMPLEBAR  THE  Strand  was divided in from  Fleetstreet  by the gate called  Templebar  before the great fire by nothing but posts rails and chains On this gate have been the sad exhibition of the heads of such unhappy men who attempt the subversion of the government of their country The last and may they be the last were of those who fell victims in to principles fortunately extinct with the family from which they originated This gate is the western limit of  Farringdon Ward Without  or the western extremity of the city of  London  On the right hand are the entrances into the  Temple  THE TEMPLE  one of our celebrated seats of law which took its name from that gallant religious military order the  knights templars  They were originally  crusaders  who happening to be quartered in places adjacent to the holy temple in  Jerusalem  in consecrated themselves to the service of religion by deeds of  Newcourt  's  Repertorium  i  arms  Hugo de Paganis Geoffry  of  St Omers  and seven others began the order by binding themselves after the manner of the regular canons of  St Augustines  to chastity and obedience and professing to protect the pilgrims to the  Holy Land  from all wrong and robbery on the road At first they subsisted on alms and had only one horse between two of them a rule was appointed for them and they wore a white habit afterwards distinguished by a red cross on their left shoulder By  their devotion and the fame of their gallant actions they became very popular in all parts of  Europe  and so enriched by the favor of princes and other great men that at the time of their dissolution the order was found possessed of sixteen thousand manors It became at last so infected with pride and luxury  FALL OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS  as to excite general hatred a persecution founded on most unjust and fictitious accusations was formed against them in  France  under  Philip le Bel  Their riches seem to have been their chief crime numbers of innocent and heroic knights suffered in the flames with the piety and constancy of martyrs some of them at the stake summoned their chief enemies  Clement  V and  Philip  to appear in a certain time at the divine tribunal both of those princes died about the time prescribed which in an age of superstition proved the validity This potent order came into  England  in the reign of king  Stephen  and had their first house in  Holborn  which was called the  Old Temple  They founded the  New Temple  in where they continued till the suppression of the order in when they were condemned to perpetual penance and dispersed into several monasteries  Edward  II granted this house and all their other possessions in  London  to  Thomas  earl of  Lancaster  and after his rebellion and forfeiture to  Aymer de Valence  earl of  Pembroke  on his death they reverted to the crown and were given to the knights hospitallers of the order of  St John  of  Jerusalem  a few years after they had so valiantly driven the  Turks  out of the isle of  Rhodes  These knights again granted the Temple to the students of the common law in the reign of  Edward  III to whose use it has been ever since applied  THE church was founded by the templars in the reign of  Henry  II upon the model of that of the holy sepulchre  ITS ROUND CHURCH  and was  consecrated in by  Heraclius  patriarch of  Jerusalem  The entrance is through a door with a  Saxon  arch Within the form is circular supported by six round arches each resting on four round pillars bound together by a fascia Above each arch is a window with a rounded top with a gallery and rich  Saxon  arches intersecting each other On the outside of the pillars is a considerable space preserving the circular form On the lower part of the wall are small pilasters meeting in pointed arches at top and over each pillar a grotesque head  JOINED to this building is a large choir of a square form with narrow  gothic  windows evidently built at another time On the outside is a buttress between every window  MONUMENTS  ON the floor of the round church are two groups of knights In the first are four each of them crosslegged three of them in complete mail in plain helmets flatted at top and with very long shields One is known to have been  Geoffry de Magnaville  created earl of  Essex  in His end was singular for driven to despair by the injustice of his monarch king  Stephen  he gave loose to every act of violence He was mortally wounded at an attack of  Burwel castle  in  Cambridgeshire  and being found by some templars was dressed by them in the habit of the order and carried from the spot as he died excommunicated they wrapped his body in lead and hung it on a crooked tree in the Temple orchard On being absolved by the pope it being proved that he expressed great penitence in his last moments he was taken down and buried first in the cemetery and afterwards in the place where we find this memorial of him  Mr  G  ugh  's Monum i tab v    ONE of these figures is singular being bareheaded and bald his legs armed his hands mailed his mantle long round his neck a cowl as if according to a common superstition in early days he had desired to be buried in the dress of a monk least the evil spirit should take possession of his body On his shield are three  fleurs de lis  IN this group is a stone coffin of a ridged shape conjectured to have been the tomb of  William Plantagenet  fifth son of  Henry  III  IN the second group are other figures but none of them crosslegged except the outmost all are armed in mail The helmets much resemble the former but two are mailed One figure is in a spirited attitude drawing a broad dagger one leg rests on the tail of a cockatrice the other in the action of being drawn up with the head of the monster beneath None of the eight figures except  Geoffry de Magnaville  are ascertained but  Cambden  conjectures that three are intended to commemorate  William  earl of  Pembroke  who died in and his sons  William  and  Gilbert  likewise earls of  Pembroke  and  Marshals  of  England  Cambden  i The others are engraven in plate xix  In the first group one of them bears a lion on his shield the arms of that great family  Gilbert  was brought up to the church and notwithstanding he was totally unskilled in exercises of chivalry would enter into the gallant lists but mounting a fiery courser was run away with flung off and killed at a tournament at  Ware  in  THE being represented crosslegged is not always a proof of the deceased having had the merit either of having been a  cru  sader  or having made a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre I have seen at  Mitton  in  Yorkshire  two figures of the  Sherbornes  thus represented one died in the other in who I verily believe could never have had any more than a wish to enter the holy land  TO these antient monuments may be added that of a bishop in his episcopal dress a mitre and a crosier well executed in stone  OF illustrious persons of later date

figure is represented recumbent and in his gown  HERE is interred the celebrated  Selden  who died in He was the best skilled in the constitution and the various branches of antiquity of any man Yet towards the close of his life he was so thoroughly convinced of the vanity of all human knowlege as to say that the th th th and th verses of the second chapter of the epistle to  Titus  afforded him more solid consolation than all that he had ever read  SIR  John Vaughan  born at  Trawscoed  in  Cardiganshire  lies near his friend Mr  Selden  both their principles were antimonarchical After the Restoration he declined preferment offered by the chancellor  Clarendon  but afterwards accepted the office of chief justice of the common pleas from the enemies of that illustrious character He died in  HALL  THE magnificent hall was rebuilt in the treasurership of  Plowden  It is ornamented with paintings by Sir  James Thornhill  and by two fulllength portraits of those pillars of the law

treasurers since the first who possessed the office It is also adorned with some of  Gibbon  's carving  THE Middle Temple gate was erected by Sir  Amias Powlet  on a singular occasion It seems that Sir  Amias  about the year thought fit to put cardinal  Wolsey  then parson of  Lymington  into the stocks  Fiddes  's life of cardinal  Wolsey    In being sent for to  London  by the cardinal on account of that antient grudge he was commanded not to quit town till farther orders In consequence he lodged five or six years  Holinshed  who calls him Sir  James  He was ancestor of earl  Powlet  in this gateway which he rebuilt and to pacify his eminence  adorned the front with the cardinal's cap badges cognisance and other devices of this butcher's son so low were the great men obliged to stoop to that meteor of the times  This gate was burnt in the great fire    THE TEMPLE GARDEN  THE garden has of late been most judiciously enlarged by a considerable embankment into the river and part of the filthy muddy shore is converted into a most beautiful walk The view up and down the water is most extremely rich  Blackfriars  bridge part of  Westminster  bridge the  Adelphi  and the elegant backfront of  Somersethouse  rival the world in variety and magnificence of objects If elegance alone was to be consulted it is heartily to be wished that these embankments may make a farther

immortalised it by his  Leges Conviviales  which he wrote for the regulation of a club of wits held here in a room he dedicated to  Apollo  over the chimneypiece of which they are preserved The tavern was in his days kept by  Simon Wadloe  whom in a copy of verses over the door of the  Apollo  he dignified with the title of  King of Skinkers  OPPOSITE to this noted house is  Chancerylane  CHANCERYLANE  the most antient of any to the west It was built in the time of  Henry  III and then called  Newlane  which was afterwards changed into its present name on account of its vicinity to the courts  SERJEANTSINN is the first which opens into the lane  SERJEANTSINN  it takes its name from having been in old times the residence or lodgings of the serjeants at law as early at lest as the time of  Henry  VI It was at that time and possibly may be yet held under a lease from the dean and chapter of  York  In  William Antrobus  citizen and taylor of  London  held it at the rent of x

 THE ROLLS  The house was founded by  Henry  III for converted  Jews  who there lived under a learned Christian  appointed to instruct and govern them In  Edward  I caused about two hundred and eighty  Jews  of both sexes to be hanged for clipping He bestowed one half of their effects on the first preachers who undertook the trouble of converting the unbelieving race and the other half for the support of the converts the house was called  Domus Conversorum  In it was first applied to its present use and the master was called  Custos Rotulorum  the first was  William Burstal  clerk The masters were selected out of the church and often king's chaplains till the year when  Thomas Cromwel  afterwards earl of  Essex  was appointed It is an office of high rank and follows that of chief justice of the king's bench The master has his chaplain and his preacher  CHAPEL  THE chapel is adjacent to the house and was built by  Inigo Jones  begun in and finished at the expence of two thousand pounds It was consecrated by  George Mounteigne  bishop of  London  and the sermon preached by the famous Doctor  Donne  Among the monuments is one of the masters Sir  Edward Bruce  created

ADJACENT to  Chancerylane  the bishops of  Chichester  had their town house It was built in a garden once belonging to  John Herberton  and was granted to them by  Henry  III who excepted it out of the charter of the  Domus Conversorum  Ch J Brooke  esq  At present the site is covered with houses known by the name of  Chichester Rents  LINCOLN'SINN  THE gate to  Lincoln'sInn  is of brick but no small ornament to the street It was built by Sir  Thomas Lovel  once a member of this inn and afterwards treasurer of the houshold to  Henry  VII The other parts were rebuilt at different times but much about the same period None of the original building is left for it was formed out of the house of the  Black Friars  which fronted  Holborn  and of the palace of  Ralph Nevil  chancellor of  England  and bishop of  Chichester  built by him in the reign of  Henry  III on a piece of ground granted to him by the king It continued to be inhabited by some of his successors in the see This was the original site of the  Dominicans  or  Black Friars  before they removed to the spot now known by that name On part of the ground now covered with buildings  Henry Lacy  earl of  Lincoln  built an  Inne  as it was in those days called for himself in which he died in The ground did belong to the  Black Friars  and was granted by  Edward  I to that great earl The whole has retained his name One of the bishops of  Chichester  in after times did grant leases of the buildings to certain students of the law reserving to themselves a rent and lodgings for themselves whenever they came to town This seems to have taken place about the time of  Henry  VII  THE chapel was designed by  Inigo Jones  CHAPEL  it is built upon massy pillars and affords under its shelter an excellent walk This work evinces that  Inigo  never was designed for a  gothic  architect The lord chancellor holds his sittings in the great hall This like that of the Temple had its revels and great  Christmasses  ANTIENT REVELS  Instead of the Lord of  Misrule  it had its  King of the Cocknies  They had also a  Jack Straw  but in the time of queen  Elizabeth  he and all his adherents were utterly banished I must not omit that in the same reign sumptuary laws were made to regulate the dress of the members of the house who were forbidden to wear long hair or great ruffs cloaks boots or spurs  REGULATIONS ABOUT BEARDS  In the reign of  Henry  VIII beards were prohibited at the great table under pain of paying double commons His daughter  Elizabeth  in the first year of her reign confined them to a fortnight's growth under penalty of  s    d  but the fashion prevaled so strongly that the prohibition was repealed and no manner of size limited to that venerable excrescence  LINCOLN'SINNFIELDS would have been one of our most beautiful squares had it been built on a regular plan  LINCOLN'SINNFIELDS  The disposition of it was in committed to the care of the lord chancellor the earls of  Worcester Pembroke Arundel  and  others  Inigo Jones  drew the groundplot and gave it the exact dimensions of the base of one of the pyramids of  Egypt  In the side called  Portugal Row  is  Lindeseyhouse  once the seat of the earls of  Lindesey  and of their descendants the dukes of  Ancaster  built after a beautiful design of that great architect The view of this side of the square and of  Lincoln'sInn  gardens is most particularly pleasing when shone on by the western sun Here also was in the time of king  William  a playhouse erected within the walls of the tenniscourt under the royal patronage In this theatre  Betterton  and his troop of actors excited the admiration of the public if we may credit  Cibber  as much as  Roscius  did the people of  Rome  or  G  rrick  those of  England  in recent days  EXECUTION OF LORD RUSSEL  ON another stage of a different nature was performed the sad tragedy of the death of the virtuous lord  Russel  who lost his head in the middle of the square on  July  st Party writers assert that he was brought here in preference to any other spot in order to mortify the citizens with the sight In fact it was the nearest open space to  Newgate  the place of his lordship's confinement otherwise the dragging him to  Towerhill  the usual concluding scene on these dreadful occasions would have given his enemies full opportunity of indulging the imputed malice  NEWCASTLEHOUSE  IN the same square at the corner of  Queenstreet  stands a house inhabited by the well known minister the late duke of  Newcastle  It was built about the year by the marquis of  Powis  and called  Powishouse  and afterwards sold to the late noble owner The architect was captain  William Winde  IN the last century  Queenstreet  was the residence of many of our people of rank Among others was  Conwayhouse  the residence of the noble family of that name  Paulethouse  belonging  to the marquis of  Winchester  and the house in which lord  Herbert  of  Cherbury  finished his romantic life  ON the back part of  Portugal Row  is  Claremarket  close to which the second  John  earl of  Clare  had a palace of his own building in which he lived about the year in a most princely manner  Howel  's Hist  London      I SHALL pursue from  Queenstreet  my journey westward and point out the most remarkable places which rose into being between the years and and incidentally of some others of later date I have before mentioned the streets which rose in that period Let me add  LONGACRE  that  Longacre  was built on a piece of ground once belonging to  Westminsterabby  called the seven acres and which in were granted to  John  earl of  Bedford  ST GILES's church and a few houses to the west of it  ST GILES'S IN THE FIELDS  in the year was but barely separated from  Broadstreet  The church is supposed to have belonged to an hospital for lepers founded about the year by  Matilda  queen to  Henry  I In antient times it was customary to present to malefactors on their way to the gallows which about the year was removed from  Smithfield  and placed between  St Giles  's  Highstreet  and  Hoglane  a great bowl of ale as the last refreshment they were to receive in this life  Newcourt  i  On the door to the churchyard is a curious piece of sculpture representing the last day containing an amazing number of figures set up about the year  HERE was executed in the most barbarous manner the famous Sir  John Oldcastle  baron  Cobham  His crime was that of adopting  the tenets of  Wycliffe  He was misrepresented to our heroic prince  Henry  V by the bigoted clergy as a heretic and traitor and that he was actually at the head of thirty thousand  Lollards  in these very fields About a hundred inoffensive people were found there  Cobham  escaped but was taken some time after in  Wales  He suffered death on this spot was hung on a gallows by a chain fastened round his body and thus suspended burnt alive He died not with the calm constancy of a martyr but with the wildest effusions of enthusiastic ravings  CHURCH  THIS church was rebuilt in By the amazing raising of the ground by filth and various adventitious matter the floor in the year was eight feet below the surface acquired in the intervening time This alone made it necessary to rebuild the church in the present century The first stone was laid in it was finished in at the expence of ten thousand pounds in a manner which does great credit to its architect Mr  Henry Flitcraft  IN the churchyard I have observed with horror a great square pit with many rows of coffins piled one upon the other all exposed to sight and smell Some of the piles were incomplete expecting the mortality of the night I turned away disgusted at the view and scandalized at the want of police which so little regards the health of the living as to permit so many putrid corpses tacked between some flight boards dispersing their dangerous effluvia over the capital  NEAR the church was the house of  Alice  dutchess  Dudley  who died here in aged ninety She was the widow of the great Sir  Robert Dudley  son to  Robert  earl of  Leicester  who by various untoward circumstances was denied legitimacy and his paternal  estates He assumed the title of duke of  Northumberland  and lived and died in great estimation in  Tuscany  This lady was advanced to the title of dutchess by  Charles  I She merited the honor by the greatness of her mind and extent of her charities Her body was interred at  Stonely  in  Warwickshire  the place of her family she being third daughter of Sir  Thomas Leigh  of  Stonely  ancestor of the late lord  Leigh  A fine monument was erected to her honor at  Stonely  See  Dugdale  's  Warwickshire  i in which is a print of the tomb and a list of her great charities  and a grateful memorial of her in this church  THE mention of  St Giles  's  bowl  naturally brings one to the late place of the conclusion of human laws It was called in the time of  Edward  III when the gentle  Mortimer  finished his days here  The Elms  but the original as well as present name was  Tybourne  TYBOURNE  not from  tye  and  burn  as if it was called so from the manner of capital punishments but from  Bourne  the  Saxon  word for a brook which gave name to a manor before the Conquest Here was also a village and church denominated  St John the Evangelist  which fell to decay and was succeeded by that of  Mary bourne  corrupted into  Marylabonne  About the year this brook furnished nine conduits for supplying the city with water but the introduction of the New River superseded the use of them Here the lord mayor had a banquettinghouse to which his lordship and brethren were wont to repair on horseback attended by their ladies in waggons and after viewing the conduits they returned to the city where they were magnificently entertained by the lord mayor  Maitland  ii    IN queen  Henrietta Maria  was compelled by her priests to take a walk by way of penance to  Tyburn  What her offence was we are not told but  Charles  was so disgusted at this insolence that he soon after sent them and all her majesty's  French  servants out of the kingdom

Christopher  second duke of that title She married her second husband as emperor of  China  which gave occasion to a scene in Sir  Courtly Nice  She was kept in the ground apartment during his grace's life and was served on the knee to the day of her death which happened in at  Newcastlehouse  at  Clerkenwell  J C Brooke  esq  The second duke and dutchess lived only in one of the wings till their house at  Whitehall  was completed  I MUST mention that to the east of  Bloomsburysquare  POWISHOUSE  in  Great Ormondstreet  stood in my memory  Powishouse  originally built by the marquis of  Powis  in the last century When it was occupied by the  Duc d'Aumont  ambassador from  Louis  XIV in it was burnt down and rebuilt at the expence of that magnificent monarch It was of brick and ornamented with fluted pilasters On the top was a great reservoir as a guard against fire and it also served as a fishpond This house was pulled down and the ground granted on building leases  I SHALL just

supporters of  England  a lion and an unicorn alternate the first with its heels upwards and the pyramid finishes with the statue of  George  I The architect was  Nicholas Hawksmoor  The church was

of the manor of  Portpole  and in eight years afterwards it was disposed of to the prior and convent of  Shene  who again disposed of it to the students of the law Not but that they were seated here

bearing its antient name  HATTONSTREET the late  Hattongarden  HATTONGARDEN  succeeded to the townhouse and gardens of the lord  Hattons  founded by Sir  Christoper Hatton  lord keeper in the reign of queen  Elizabeth  He first attracted the royal notice by his fine person and fine dancing but his intellectual accomplishments were far from superficial He discharged his great office with applause but distrusting his legal abilities never acted without the assistance of two able lawyers The place he built his house on was the orchard and garden belonging to  Elyhouse  By his interest with the queen he extorted it from the bishop  Richard Cox  who for a long time resisted the sacrilege Here he died and was interred in the cathedral of  St Paul  's  THIS palace was long before distinguished by the death of a much greater man for at this house of the bishop of  Ely  say historians  John  duke of  Lancaster  otherwise  John  of  Gaunt  in breathed his last after according to  Shakespeare  giving his dying fruitless admonition to his dissipated nephew  Richard  II  ELYHOUSE  ADJACENT stood in my memory  Elyhouse  the residence of the bishops of  Ely John de Kirkby  who died bishop of  Ely  in laid the foundation of this palace by bequeathing several messuages in this place others were purchased by his successor  William de Luda  at length the whole consisted of twenty some say forty acres was inclosed in a wall  Holinshed  has recorded the excellency of the strawberries cultivated in the garden by bishop  Morton  He informs us that  Richard  duke of  Glocester  afterwards  Richard  III at the council held in the  Tower  on the morning he put  Hastings  to death requested a dish of them from the bishop Mr  Grose  has given us two representations of the buildings and chapel Here was a most venerable hall seventyfour feet long lighted with six  gothic  windows and all the furniture suited the hospitality of the times this room the serjeants at law frequently borrowed to hold their feasts in on account of its size  GREAT FEASTS HELD HERE  In the year eleven gentlemen who had just been honored with the coif gave a grand feast here five days successively On the first the king and his queen  Catherine  of  Arragon  graced them with their presence For quantity of provisions it resembled a coronation feast the  minutiae  are not given but the following particular of part will suffice  Stow  book iii  to shew its greatness as well as the wonderful scarcity of money in those days evinced by the smallness of the prices compared to those of the present days     £  s  d  Brought to the slaughterhouse beeves each        One carcase of an oxe from the shambles        One hundred fat muttons each        Fiftyone great veales at        Thirtyfour porkes

THE chapel which was dedicated to  St Etheldreda  CHAPEL  foundress of the monastery at  Ely  has at the east end a very handsome  gothic  window which looks into a neat court lately built called  Elyplace  Beneath is a crypt of the length of the chapel The cloisters formed a square on the south side  THE several buildings belonging to this palace falling into ruin it was thought proper to enable by act of parlement in the bishop to alienate the whole It was accordingly sold to the crown for the sum of six thousand five hundred pounds together with an annuity of two hundred pounds a year to be payed to the bishop and his successors for ever Out of the first five thousand six hundred was applied towards the purchase of  Albemarlehouse  in  Doverstreet  with other messuages and gardens The remainder together with three thousand pounds paid as dilapidations by the executors of bishop  Mawson  was applied  towards building the handsome house at present occupied in  Doverstreet  by my respected friend the present prelate This was named  Elyhouse  and is settled on the bishops of  Ely  for ever It was the fortune of that munificent prelate  Edmund Keene  to rebuild or repair more ecclesiastical houses than any churchman of modern days He bestowed most considerable repairs on the parsonagehouse of  Stanhope  in the bishoprick of  Durham  He wholly rebuilt the palace at  Chester  He restored almost from rain that at  Ely  and finally  Elyhouse  was built under his inspection  TO revert to antient times  John  duke of  Lancaster  styled usually  John  of  Gaunt  resided in this palace and died here in possibly it was lent to him during the long possession that bishop  Fordham  had of the see after the duke's own palace the  Savoy  was burnt by the insurgents  ST ANDREW's HOLBORN  FROM hence is a steep descent down  Holbornhill  On the south side is  St Andrew  's church of considerable antiquity but rebuilt in the last century in a plain neat manner Here was buried  Thomas Wriothesley  lord chancellor in the latter part of the life of  Henry  VIII a fiery zealot who not content with seeing the amiable innocent  Anne Askew  put to the torture for no other crime than difference of faith flung off his gown degraded the chancellor into the  Bourreau  and with his own hands gave force to the rack  Ballard  's lives of  British  ladies  He was created earl of  Southampton  just before the coronation of  Edward  VI but obstinately adhering to the old religion he was dismissed from his post and confined to  Southamptonhouse  where he died in  THE wellknown party tool Doctor  Sacheverel  was rector of this church He had the chance of meeting in his parish a person as turbulent as himself the noted Mr  Whiston  that singular character took it into his head to disturb the doctor while he was in his pulpit venting some doctrine contrary to the opinion of that heterodox man The doctor in great wrath descended from on high and fairly turned  wicked Will Whiston  into the street  IN ascending to  West Smithfield Cocklane  is left to the right  COCKLANE GHOST  a ridiculous scene of imposture in the affair of the  Cocklane  ghost which was to detect the murderer of the body it lately inhabited by its appearance in the vault of  St John  's church  Clerkenwell  The credulity of the  English  nation was most fully displayed by the great concourse of people of all ranks to hear the conversation held by one of the cheats with the ghost It ended in full detection and exemplary punishment of the several persons concerned in the villainy  SMITHFIELD is celebrated on several accounts at present  SMITHFIELD  and long since for being the great market for cattle of all kinds  BARTHOLOMEWFAIR  For being the place where  Bartholomewfair  was kept which was granted during three days annually by  Henry  II to the neighboring priory It was long a season of great festivity theatrical performances by the better actors were exhibited here and it was frequented by a great deal of good company but becoming the resort of the debauched of all denominations certain regulations took place which in later days have spoiled the mirth but produced the desired decency The humours of this place will never be lost as long as the inimitable print of  Bartholomewfair  of our  Hogarth  shall exist  PLACE FOR TOURNAMENTS  FOR a long series of reigns  Smithfield  was the field of gallant tilts and tournaments and also the spot on which accusations were decided by duel derived from the  Kampfight  ordeal of the  Saxons  Here in the doating hero  Edward  III in his sixtysecond year infatuated by the charms of  Alice Pierce  placed her by his side in a magnificent car and styling her the  Lady of the Sun  conducted her to the lifts followed by a train of knights each leading by the bridle a beautiful palfrey mounted by a gay damsel and for seven days together exhibited the most splendid justs in indulgence of his disgraceful passion  HIS grandson  Richard  II in the same place held a tournament equally magnificent  There issued out of the  Towre  of  London  says the admiring  Froissart  "fyrst threescore coursers apparelled for the justes and on every one a squyer of honour riding a soft pase Than issued out threescore ladyes of honoure mounted on fayre palfreyes and every lady led a knight by a cheyne of sylver which knights were apparelled to just  I refer to my author  Froissart  tom iv ch xxii Lord  Berner  's translation ii p ccix  for the rest of the relation of this splendid spectacle certainly there was a magnificence and spirit of gallantry in the dissipation of those early times which cherished a warlike and generous spirit in the nobility and gentry of the land Something like is now arising in the brilliant societies of archers in most parts of  Britain  which it is to be hoped will at lest share the hours consumed in the enervated pleasures of music or the dangerous waste of time in the hours dedicated to cards  FOR TRIALS BY DUEL  I WILL not trespass on my readers patience any more on this subject than just to mention one instance of duel It was when  the unfortunate Armourer entered into the lists on account of a false accusation of treason brought against him by his apprentice in the reign of  Henry  VI The friends of the defendant had so plied him with liquor that he fell an easy conquest to his accuser  Shakespear  has worked this piece of history into a scene in the second part of  Henry  VI but has made the poor Armourer confess his treasons in his dying moments for in the time in which this custom prevaled it never was even suspected but that guilt must have been the portion of the vanquished Let me add that when people of rank fought with sword and lance  Plebeian  combatants were only allowed a pole armed with a heavy sandbag with which they were to decide their guilt or innocence  IN  Smithfield  was also held our  Autos de Fè  but  FOR EXECUTIONS  to the credit of our  English  monarchs none were ever known to attend the ceremony Even  Philip  II of  Spain  never honored any of the many which were celebrated by permission of his gentle queen with his presence notwithstanding he could behold the roasting of his own subjects with infinite selfapplause and  sangfroid  The stone marks the spot in this area on which those cruel exhibitions were executed Here our martyr  Latimer  preached patience to friar  Forest  agonizing under the torture of a slow fire for denying the king's supremacy and to this place our martyr  Cranmer  compelled the amiable  Edward  by forcing his reluctant hand to the warrant to send  Joan Bocher  a silly woman to the stake Yet  Latimer  never thought of his own conduct in his last moments nor did  Cranmer  thrust his hand into the fire for a real crime but for one which was venial through the frailty of human nature  THE last person who suffered at the stake in  England  was  Bartholomew Legatt  who was burnt here in as a blasphemous  heretic according to the sentence pronounced by  John King  bishop of  London  The bishop consigned him to the secular arm of our monarch  James  who took care to give to the sentence full effect  See part iv of the history of the first fourteen years of king  James  This place as well as  Tyburn  was called  The Elms  and used for the execution of malefactors even before the year In the year there was a most severe and singular punishment inflicted here on one  John Roose  a cook who had poisoned seventeen persons of the bishop of  Rochester  's family two of whom died By a retrospective law he was sentenced to be boiled to death which was done accordinglyIn  Marg  ret Davie  a young woman suffered in the same place and manner for the same species of crimeIn  Smithfield  the archrebel  Wat Tyler  met with in the reward of his treason and insolence The youthful king no longer able to bear his brutality ordered him to be arrested when the gallant  Walworth  lord mayor of  London  struck him off his horse and the attendants of the monarch quickly put him to death  I CANNOT help indulging myself with the mention of  William Pennant  an honest goldsmith my great great great great great great uncle who at his house the  Queen'shead  in  Smithfield  acquired a considerable fortune in the latter end of the reign of  Elizabeth  and the beginning of that of  James  I It appears by his will dated  May  th that he was employed by the court for numbers of his legacies were to the royal servants His legacy to Sir  William Fortescue  knight his wife's brother has now a singular appearanceone chain of gold and pearle weighing about ounces and a quarter one billament of gold and  pearl being pieces a round salt of silver and a cover thereto weighing ounces and somewhat more six white silver spoons one feather bed bolster two pillows two blankets one blue rug a testearn of satten figured russet and black and vallance to the same curtains of taffety sarcenet one chair and a stool with a back of satten figured russet ten black and six stools covered with black wrought velvet and also a great chest covered with black leather with an inlock and all things in it excepting certain plate hereafter bequeathed He left to his nephew  Hugh Pennant  of  Bychton Flintshire  the manor of  Moxhall  in  Essex  with a considerable estate but the fruits of the labors of this industrious tradesman were all dissipated by a  gentleman  of the family who fortunately quitted this life before he had wasted our paternal acres But the charities of  William Pennant  to the poor of  Whiteford Flintshire  are more permanent for to this day they completely cloath twenty poor people and in a few years more the trustees of the bequeathed lands flatter themselves with the hopes of doubling the number  WE now reach a great extent of holy ground consecrated for the purposes of monastic life or for the humane purpose of affording relief to our distressed brethren in their passage through this world I have not in view a conventual history of  London  but only mean to give a brief account of those foundations which have a clame to preeminence The church of  St Bartholomew the Greater  is a small distance from  Smithfield  CHURCH OF ST BARTHOLOMEW  it is only the choir of the antient building and the center on which stood the great tower In the choir are the remains of the old architecture massy columns and round arches part of the cloisters are still preserved in a neighboring stable and consists of eight arches  Adjacent is part of the south transept now converted into a small buryingground  PRIORY OF ST BARTHOLOMEW  This was a conventual church belonging to a priory of Black Canons founded in by one  Rahere  minstrel or jester to  Henry  I who quitting his profligate life became the first prior of his own foundation  Legend  relates that he had a most horrible dream out of which he was relieved by  St Bartholomew  himself who directed him to found the house and to dedicate it to him  Rahere  has here a handsome monument beneath an arch divided by elegant tabernaclework His figure is recumbent with an angel at his feet and a canon in a great hood kneeling on each side as if praying over him It was afterwards repaired by  William Bolton  the last prior At the dissolution its revenues according to  Dugdale  were £  s  It was granted by  Henry  to Sir  Richard Rich  Queen  Mary  repeopled it with Black or Preaching Friars but on the accession of  Elizabeth  they were turned out  Rich  who was made lord chancellor in the reign of  Edward  VI made it his place of residence as did Sir  Walter Mildmay  chancellor of the exchequer to queen  Elizabeth  ST BARTHOLOMEW's HOSPITAL  ST BARTHOLOMEW's hospital will ever be a monument of the piety of  Rahere  for from him it took its origin On a waste spot he obtained a grant of a piece of ground from his master and built on it an hospital for a master brethren and sisters and for the entertainment of poor diseased people till they got well of distressed women big with child till they were delivered and were able to go abroad and for the support of all such children whose mothers died in the house till they attained the age of seven years It was given to the neighboring priory who had the care of it Its revenues at the dissolution  were £ according to  Dugdale  The good works of  Rahere  live to this day The foundation was continued through every reign The present handsome building which surrounds a square was begun in The extent of the charity is shewn by saying that in the last year there were under the care of the hospital three thousand seven hundred and fifty inpatients and eight thousand one hundred and twenty three out patients  THE great staircase is admirably painted by  Hogarth  at his own expence The subjects are the good  Samaritan  and the pool of  Bethesda  In another part is  Rahere  laying the foundation stone a sick man carried on a bier attended by monks The hall is at the head of the staircase a very large room ornamented with a fulllength of  Henry  VIII who had good reason to be complimented as he presented this house to the citizens Doctor  Ratcliff  is also here at fulllength He left five hundred pounds a year to this hospital for the improvement of the diet and one hundred a year for buying of linen Happy had it been had all his wealth been so directed instead of wasting it on that vain  mausoleum  his library at  Oxford  The patron saint has over the chimneypiece his portrait but not in the offensive circumstances which  Spagnolet  would have placed it in for he is cloathed and has only the knife the symbol of his martyrdom in his hand In the windows is painted  Henry  VIII delivering the charter to the lord mayor by him is prince  Arthur  and two noblemen with white rods  AT no great distance from this hospital stands within the walls of the city that of  Christchurch  CHRISTCHURCH HOSPITAL  a royal foundation for orphans and poor children who are taken care of and apprenticed  ONCE THE GREY FRIARS  at different ages to proper trades It was originally the house of

and queen  Philippa  wife of  Edward  III gave threescore and two pounds towards the building  John de Bretagne  duke of  Richmond  built the body of the church at a vast expence and  Gilbert de C  are  earl of  Gloucester  gave twenty great beams out of his forest at  Tunbridge  No order of monks seem to have the powers of persuasion equal to these poor friars They raised vast sums for their buildings among the rich and few of their admirers when they came to die who did not console themselves with the thought of lying within their expiating walls and if they were particularly wicked thought themselves secure against the assault of the devil if their corpse was wrapped in the habit and cowl of a friar  PERSONAGES INTERRED HERE  MULTITUDES therefore of all ranks were crowded in

SIR  Robert Tresilian  chief justice of  England  and Sir  Nicholas  Brembre  the stout mayor of  London  suffered the same ignominous death in the next reign The first as a warning to all judges for too great a complaisance to the pleasure of the court Sir  Nicholas  for his attachment to his royal master  Tresilian  fell lamented especially as the proceedings were hurried in a tumultuary manner and more indicative of revenge than justice Superstition records that when he came to  Tyburn  he declared that he should not die while he had any thing about him and that the executioner on stripping

thirtyone broad it was cieled with wainscot had twentyeight desks and eight double settles of wainscot In three years it was filled with books to the value of five hundred and fiftysix pounds of which Sir  Richard  contributed four hundred pounds and Doctor  Thomas Winchelsey  a friar supplied the rest This about thirty years before the invention of printing  ON the dissolution this fine church after being spoiled of its ornaments for the king's use was made a storehouse for  French  prizes and the monuments either sold or mutilated  Henry  just before his death touched with remorse granted the convent and church to the city and caused the church to be opened for divine service It was burnt in and rebuilt by Sir  Christopher Wren  at a small distance from its former site I must mention that with the old church was destroyed the tomb of lady  Veneti  Digby  My Journey to  London  The tomb is engraven in the Antiquaries Repository    THE buildings belonging to the friars were by  Edward  VI  applied to this useful charity that amiable young prince had not any reason to be stimulated to good actions but it is certain that after a sermon of exhortation preached before him by  Ridley  bishop of  London  he founded three great hospitals in this city judiciously adapted to the necessities of the poor divided into three classes the hospital of  St Thomas Southwark  for the sick or wounded poor this for the orphan and that of  Bridewell  for the thriftless  Charles  II founded also here a mathematical school for the instruction of forty boys and training them up for the sea Many able mathematicians and seamen have sprung from this institution In the last year a hundred and sixtyeight were apprenticed out of which nine were from the lastmentioned institution The governors have a seminary to this hospital at  Hertford  At  London  and at  Hertford  are nine hundred and eightytwo children  PART of the old buildings and cloister are yet remaining but the greater part was rebuilt in the last century under the direction of Sir  Christopher Wren  The writing school was founded in by Sir  John Moor  alderman who is honored with a statue in front of the building  GREAT HALL  IN the great hall is a fine picture of  Charles  II in his robes with a great flowing black wig At a distance is a sea view with shipping and about him a globe sphere telescope c It was painted by  Lely  in  HERE is the longest picture I ever saw King  James  II amidst his courtiers receiving the president of this hospital several of the governors and numbers of the children all kneeling one of the governors with a grey head and some of the heads of the children are admirably painted Chancellor  Jefferies  is standing by the  king This was painted by  Verrio  who has placed himself in the piece in a long wig  THE founder is represented in another picture sitting and giving the charter to the governors who are in their red gowns kneeling the boys and girls are ranged in two rows a bishop possibly  Ridley  is in the piece If this was the work of  Holbein  it has certainly been much injured by repair  IN the courtroom is a threequarters length of  Edward  a most beautiful portrait indisputably by the hand of that great painter The figure is most richly dressed with one of his hands upon a dagger  IN this room are the portraits of two persons of uncommon merit The first is of Sir  Wolstan Dixie  lord mayor in He is repr  nted in a red gown furred a rich chain and with a rough beard The date on his portrait is He was descended from  Wolstan Dixie  who was seated at  Catworth  in  Huntingdonshire  about the reign of  Edward  III Sir  Wolstan  was the founder of the family of baronets settled at  MarketBosworth  in  Leicestershire  which was bestowed by him on his great nephew in the reign of queen  Elizabeth  Collins's Baronets  iii  Sir  Wolstan  was distinguished by the magnificent pageantry of his mayor's day and by the poetical incense bestowed on the occasion by  George Peele  A M of  Christchurch College Oxford  who among other things wrote the life of our last prince  Llewelyn  the loves of king  David  and the fair  Bathsheba  and the tragedy of  Absalom  Wood's Athenae Oxon  i  But Sir  Wolstan  immortalized himself by his good deeds and the greatness of his  charities At  Bosworth  he founded a freeschool every prison in the capital felt his bounty he portioned poor maidens in marriage contributed largely to build a pesthouse established two fellowships in  Emanuel College Cambridge  and two scholarships and left to this hospital an annual endowment of fortytwo pounds for ever  BUT a lady dame  Mary Ramsay  wife of Sir  Thomas Ramsay  lord mayor in greatly surpassed Sir  Wolstan  in her charitable deeds By the gift of twenty pounds a year to be annually paid to the master and usher of the school belonging to this hospital and also to the hospital the reversion of a hundred and twenty pounds annually She was complimented with having her picture placed in this room She is dressed in a redbodied gown and petticoat She augmented fellowships and scholarships cloathed ten maimed soldiers at the expence of twenty pounds annually she did not forget the prisoners in the several gaols she gave the sum of twelve hundred pounds to five of the companies to be lent to young tradesmen for four years she gave to  Bristol  a thousand pounds to be laid out in an hospital she married and portioned poor virgins and besides other charities I omit left three thousand pounds to good and pious uses This excellent woman died about the year and was interred in the church of  St Mary Woolnoth  The charities of both these worthy characters may be seen in  Stow  's  Sur  aie      CHARTERHOUSESQUARE  IN this square at the time called the  Charterhouse Yard  was a townhouse belonging to the earls of  Rutland  which in the year was converted into an operahouse over which Sir  William  d' Avenant  presided  British Biogr  d ed ii  for in those times of hypocrisy tragedies and comedies were not permitted  THE  Charterhouse  is the next object of attention  CHARTERHOUSE  This had been a house of  Carthusians  from which the name is corrupted founded by Sir  Walter de Manni  a most successful commander in the  French  wars under  Edward  III He had purchased in the year a piece of ground consisting of thirteen acres for the purpose of interring the dead at a time in which a dreadful pestilence raged Not fewer than fifty thousand people were buried in it during the time of this dreadful calamity which shews how very populous  London  must have been at that period In the preceding year  Ralph Sratford  bishop of  London  had bought another piece of land adjoining to this which he inclosed with a brick wall built on it a chapel and applied to the same use under the name of  Pardon Churchyard  Here also were buried suicides and such who had been executed They were brought here in what was called the  Friars cart  which was tilted and covered over with black in it was a pendent bell so that notice was given as it passed along of the sad burden it was carrying  Stow's Survaie      SIR WALTER first intended to found here a college for a warden dean and twelve secular priests but changing his design he in conjunction with  Northburgh  bishop of  London  founded a priory for twentyfour monks of the rigid order of  Carthusians  which was finished in  Tanner  The last prior but one  John Howghton  subscribed to the king's supremacy in yet was  executed soon after for his opposition to the royal will Three years after that there was a second subscription in which  William Trafford  the last prior and two and twenty of his house subscribed to the king's supremacy  Willis  's Abbies ii  At the dissolution its revenues were reckoned according to  Dugdale  at £ a year It was first granted in to  John Bridges  and  Thomas Hall  for their joint lives and in  April  to Sir  Edward North  who sold it to  Thomas  duke of  Norfolk  for twentyfive hundred pounds and his son the earl of  Suffolk  the rapacious treasurer alienated it to  Thomas Sutton  esq  for thirteen thousand pounds  MR SUTTON's FOUNDATION  THAT gentleman made a most dignified use of his purchase In the time of  James  I he converted it into a most magnificent hospital consisting of a master a preacher a head schoolmaster and second master with fortyfour boys eighty decayed gentlemen who had been soldiers or merchants besides physician surgeons register and other officers and servants of the house Each decayed gentleman has fourteen pounds a year a gown meat fire and lodgings and one of them may if he chuses attend the manciple to market to see that he buys good provisions This is the greatest gift in  England  either in protestant or catholic times ever bestowed by a single man till we come to the time of the foundation of  Guy's Hospital  in  Southwark  THERE is scarcely any vestige of the conventual building which is said to have stood in the present garden The present extensive house was the work of the duke of  Norfolk  It was inhabited by the noble purchaser the last time it was made his easy prison for having been committed to the  Tower  in  he was permitted to return to his own house under the custody of Sir  Henry Nevil  the plague at that time raging within the  Tower

arms and the date the very year of his final imprisonment  HIS grandson lord  Thomas Howard  was in possession of this house at the accession of  James  I This monarch to shew his respect for a family

four whole days  Stow's Annals    at his departure he was as profuse of his honors as he had been at  Theobalds  just before for he dubbed here not fewer than fourscore knights  IN one of the great apartments is a very good halflength of Mr  Sutton  in a black gown furred and with a white beard He himself intended to have filled the post of master but being seized with his last illness by deed nominated the Reverend  John Hutton  to the office He died  December  th aged his body was embalmed kept in his own house till  May  when it was deposited with great pomp in  Christchurch  from whence in the chapel in his hospital being by that time finished it was carried on the shoulders of the poor into the vault prepared for its reception His figure in a gown lies recumbent on the tomb on each side is a man in armour standing upright and  above a preacher addressing a full congregation This was the work of  Nicholas Stone  who including a little monument to Mr  Law  one of Mr  Sutton  's executors had four hundred pounds for his performance  Mr  Walpole's Anecdotes  ii    GEORGE VILLIERS the second of that name duke of  Buckingham  fulllength in a long wig and robes of the garter  THE

very prince whom he had invited over He died neglected by all parties permanent only in the protestant religion to which he was an early convert by the arguments of our great  Tillotson  He died in  February  giving almost with his last breath assurance of his adherence to the church of  England  THE duke of  Monmouth  in a long black wig dressed if I remember right like the former  THE munificent  Sheldon  archbishop of  Canterbury  is represented here sitting He did honor to his promotion by his patron  Charles  II whom he attended in his exile He was equally conspicuous for his charity and his piety He expended above sixtysix thousand pounds in public and private benefactions in relieving the miserable distressed in the time of the pestilence and in redeeming Christian slaves His theatre at  Oxford  is a magnificent  proof of his respect to the university in which he had most honorably presided as warden of the  College of All Souls  HERE is a threequarters piece of Doctor  Thomas Burnet  master of this house highly celebrated for his learning and equally so for the spirit with which he resisted the obtrusion of a  Roman  catholic into the office by  James  II He was the author of the famous Sacred Theory of the Earth a beautiful and eloquent philosophical romance and of the  Archaelogia Philosophica  This last subjected him to such censure for the sceptical opinions it contained as to prevent his farther preferment He died in He is represented as a thin man of a good countenance in a black gown and short hair  THE hero  William  earl  Craven  is the last

stood the priory of  St John  of  Jerusalem  of the warlike order of the knights hospitalers After the taking of  Jerusalem  from the  Saracens  there was a vast concourse of pilgrims to the holy sepulchre A pious man of the name of  Gerardus  associating with other persons of his religious turn assumed a black garment with a white cross on it with eight spikes and undertook the care of an hospital before founded at  Jerusalem  for the use of the pilgrims and also to protect them from insults on the road either in coming or returning  Godfrey  of  Bologne  first instituted the order and in reward of the valour of  Gerardus  at the battle of  Ascalon  endowed the knights with great estates to enable them to support the end of their order the kings of  France  were the sovereigns After the loss of  Jerusalem  they retired from place to place but  having taken  Rhodes  fixed there and were then styled knights of  Rhodes  But in on the loss of that island they retreated to  Malta  and were afterwards known by the name of knights of  Malta  The order before the separation of  England  from the church of  Rome  consisted of eight nations The world is filled with their prodigious valour  JORDAN BRISET and  M  riel  his wife persons of rank founded this house in the year and it received consecration from  Heraclius  patriarch of  Jerusalem  This order at first styled itself servant to the poor servants of the hospital at  Jerusalem  but their vast endowments infected them with an uncommon degree of pride The whole order had in different parts of  Christendom  nineteen thousand manors In the revenues of the  English  knights templars were bestowed on them This gave them such importance that the prior was ranked as first baron of  England  and lived in the highest state Their luxury gave offence to the rebels of  Kent  and  Essex  in These levellers burnt their house to the ground but it soon rose with double splendor The first prior was  Garnerius de Neapoli  the last Sir  William Weston  who on the suppression by  Henry  VIII had a pension of a thousand a year but died on  Ascensionday  the very day that the house was suppressed  Newcour  t  i  entirely of a broken heart His monument is preserved by a drawing in the collection of Doctor  C  mbes  His figure lay recumbent beneath rich  gothic  arches It had a long beard and is represented greatly emaciated Its revenue at that time according to  Dugdale  was £  s    d  S  t  Iohns Gate  THE house and church remained entire during the reign of  Henry  ST JAMES's CLERKENWELL  for he chose to keep in them his tents and toils for the chace In that of his son the church which for the beauty of its tower which was graven gilt and enameled was blown up with gunpowder by order of the protector  Somerset  and the stones carried towards the building his palace in the  Strand  In the next reign apart of the choir which remained and some sidechapels were repaired by cardinal  Pole  and Sir  Thomas Tresham  was appointed lord prior  Mr  Brooke Somerset  Herald  but the restoration was shortlived being again suppressed by  Elizabeth  THE buildings covered a great extent of ground and are now occupied by  St John'ssquare  The magnificent gateway still remains  James  I made a grant of it to Sir  Roger Wilbraham  who made it his habitation  AYLESBURYHOUSE and gardens were other parts of the possessions of those knights They were granted to the  Bruces  earls of  Aylesbury  who made the house their residence Earl  Robert  deputy earlmarshal dates numbers of his letters in from  Aylesburyhouse Clerkenwell Aylesburystreet  now covers the site of the house and gardens  THE same  Jordan Briset  BENEDICTINE NUNS  not satisfied with the former great endowment gave to one  Robert  a priest fourteen acres of land almost adjoining to the first to build on them a religious house He accordingly founded one to the honor of God and the assumption of our lady which he filled with Black Nuns of the order of  St Benedict  The first prioress was  Christina  the last  Isabella Sackville  of the family of the present duke of  Dorset  She appointed  pointed her cousin lord  Buckhurst  executor of her will made  February  th if his lordship would undertake the trouble She was buried in the conventual church a small brass plate informs us she died in the reign of queen  Elizabeth  SIR  Thomas Chaloner  tutor to prince  Henry  built a fine house in the close of the priory and on it inscribed these apt verses  Casta fides superest velatae tecta sorores  Ista relegatae deseruere licèt  Nam venerandus  Hymen  hic vota jugalia servat  Vestalemque forum mente fovere studet  Fuller  's Church History book vi    THE church was made parochial Part of the cloisters remain at lest till very lately as did part of the nun's hall In very antient records it was styled  PARISH CLERKS OUR ANTIENT ACTORS  Ecclesia Beatae Mariae de fonte Clericorum  from a well near it at which the parishclerks of  London  were accustomed to meet annually to perform their mysteries or sacred dramatical plays In they performed before the king and queen and whole court three days successively These amusements with much more substantial peaceofferings were presented to  Richard  to divert his resentment against the good citizens for a riot of no very great moment against the bishop of  Salisbury  Holinshed    And in they performed the creation of the world which lasted eight days and most of the nobility and gentry of  England  honored them with their presenceBut to return to the church Besides the venerable prioress here was interred the lord prior of the knights hospitalers abovementioned  Sir  William Weston  who lies under a tomb beneath an arch of neat  gothic  work The brass is lost but there is still his effigies represented in his shroud emaciated by death but admirably cut in stone  Weever  preserves part of his epitaph but it gives us nothing historical  Funeral Monuments  That great collector of funeral monuments and inscriptions lies here himself He died in  Fuller  's  Worthies    aged and left his own quaint epitaph  Lankashire  gave me birth and  Cambridge  education  Middlesex  gave me death and this church my humation  And CHRIST to me hath given  A place with him in heaven  I SHALL conclude with having observed here the plain monument of  Gilbert Burnet  bishop of  Salisbury  His literary merits and demerits have been so fully discussed that I rather chuse to refer the readers to the writers who have undertaken the task Let his excellent discharge of his episcopal function expiate the errors which his enemies of each party so liberally impute to him  NOW I am on the outside of the church again let me in this revival of archery direct the attention of the brethren and sisters of the bow to the epitaph of Sir  William Wood  a celebrated archer who died in aet May their longevity equal his but when they have made their last shot I hope that the  Royal British  BOWMEN have provided an abler bard to celebrate their skill than fell to the lot of poor  William Wood  Stow  ii book iv    CLOSE to  Clerkenwellgreen  stands  Albemarle  or  Newcastlehouse  the property and residence of the mad dutchess and widow of the second duke of  Albemarle  and last surviving daughter and coheiress of  Cavendish  duke of  Newcastle  who died here in At p some account is given of this lady The house is entire and at present occupied by a cabinetmaker In the garden is the entire side of the cloister of the nunnery and part of the wall and a door belonging to the nuns hall Scattered over the ground are the remains of the antient monuments of Sir  Richard Weston  and others shamefully ruined being flung here during the rebuilding of the church  OPPOSITE to this house is another very large ascended to by a long flight of steps It is now divided into three houses It is called  Oliver Cromwell  's and tradition says it was his place of conference with  Ireton Bradshaw  and others If it had been his residence it probably was usurped from some of the loyalists and made his mansion before he attained his fullness of power and lived in regal state at  Whitehall  NEW RIVER HEAD  In the fields at a small distance from  Clerkenwell  is the  New River Head  the great repository which supplies the largest portion of our capital with water To give a greater extent of service of late years another reservoir has been made on the heights at a little distance to the north of the former This is supplied with water from the first by means of an engine which is worked by horses forcing the water up the ascent from hence it streams down to places which the other had not the power of benefiting These reservoirs may be called the HEART of the work The element essentially useful as the vital fluid at first rushes through veins of vast diameter divides into lesser and  again into thousands of ramifications which support the life of this most populous city  NO one ought to be ignorant that this unspeakable benefit is owing to a WELSHMAN Sir HUGH MIDDELTON of  Denbigh  who on  September  th began and on  September  th completed the great work He brought the water from  Amwell  in  Hertfordshire  a distance of twenty but from the necessity of making a  detour  to avoid hills and vallies it was increased to thirtyeight miles threequarters and sixteen poles Yet it was impossible to escape difficulties His daring spirit penetrated the hills in several places and carried the river over two vallies Over one it extended six hundred and sixty feet in length and thirty in height and over another four hundred and sixtytwo feet in length The original source of this river was by the vast increase of  London  found inadequate to its wants The New River company found it necessary to have recourse to another supply They applied to parlement for powers to obtain it from the river  Lee  the property of the city  London  opposed the benefit intended its inhabitants but in vain parlement wisely determined against their objections so the blessing was forced upon them and the river  Lee  supplies the greater part of the wants of the city Sir HUGH MIDDELTON was ruined by the execution of his project So little was the benefit understood that for above thirty years the seventytwo shares it was divided into shared only five pounds apiece Each of these shares was sold originally for a hundred pounds Within this twelvemonth they were sold at nine thousand pounds a share and lately at ten thousand and are increasing because their profits increase on which their dividends are grounded Half of the seventytwo shares  are called king's shares and are in less estimation than the others because subject to a grant of five hundred pounds a year made so long ago as the reign of  James  I when the water was first brought to  London  or soon after  I NOW descend to the  Temple  and resume my journey along  Fleetstreet  as far as the southern extremity of the walls of  London  the antient precinct to follow them to their opposite end near the  Tower  to describe their neighboring suburbs and the parts of the city bordering on their interior sides These with the city itself shall form the final consideration together with the suburbs which point to  Blackwall  and form a street of amazing extent  ST DUNSTAN'S CHURCH  JUST beyond the entrance into  Chancerylane  is  St Dunstan  's church The saint to whom it was dedicated was a person of great ingenuity and excelled in painting engraving and music From the following lines it appears that he was the inventor of the  Aeolian  harp  St Dunstan  's harp fast by the wall  Upon a pin did hang a  The harp itself with ly and all  Untouch'd by hand did twang a  New View of  London  i    For this he was represented to king  Athelstan  as a conjuror He was an excellent workman in brass and iron It was when thus employed at his forge that he seized the devil by the nose with the redhot tongs till he roared again The daemon had visited him in a female form and suffered for intruding on this womanhating saint  HIS church is probably of very antient foundation yet the first mention of it is in when the abbot and convent of  Westminster  bestowed it on  Henry  III who bestowed the profits on the  Domus Conversorum  or the house for converted Jews The two figures of savages on the outside of the clock striking the quarters with their clubs were set up in and are much admired by the gaping populace  NEXT to the  Temple  is another  Serjeant'sInn  destined originally for the same purpose as that in  Chancerylane  And nearer to the  Thames  a little east of the  King'sbench Walks  THE WHITE FRIARS  stood the church and convent of  Carmelites  or  White Friars  founded in by Sir  Richard Grey  ancestor of the lord  Greys  of  Codnor Edward  I bestowed on them more ground that they might enlarge their buildings The order originated from the hermits of  Mount Carmel  who inhabited the mountain which  Elias  and  Eliseus  inhabited On the dissolution its revenues were £  s    d  Part of the house was granted by  Henry  to  Richard Moresque  and the chapterhouse and other parts to his physician  William Butts  immortalized by  Shakespear Edward  VI bestowed the house inhabited by Doctor  Butts  together with the church to the bishop of  Worcester  and his successors It was afterwards demolished with all its tombs and several houses inhabited in the reign of  Edward  VI by people of fashion That church was built by Sir  Robert Knolles  a great warrior in the time of  Edward  III and  Richard  II who was honorably interred here in  John Mowbray  earl of  Nottingham  in in his youthful years  Elizabeth  wife of  Henry  earl of  Kent  who had wasted his substance by gaming That noble family had for  some time a house in the  White Friars John  lord  Gray  son to  Reginald  lord  Gray  of  Wilton  in and numbers of others of the common gentry  BOLTCOURT  I MUST by no means omit  Boltcourt  the long residence of Doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON a man of the strongest natural abilities great learning a most retentive memory of the deepest and most unaffected piety and morality mingled with those numerous weaknesses and prejudices which his friends have kindly taken care to draw from their dread abode I brought on myself his transient anger by observing that in his tour in  Scotland  he once had  long and woeful experience of oats being the food of men in  Scotland  as they were of horses in  England  It was a national reflection unworthy of him and I shot my bolt In return he gave me a tender hug  See Doctor JOHNSON's Journey to the  Western Islands  p See his Dictionary article  Oats  and my Voyage to the  Hebrides  first edition    Con amore  he also said of me  The dog is a Whig  Mr  Boswel  's Journal  I admired the virtues of lord  Russel  and pitied his fall I should have been a Whig at the Revolution There have been periods since in which I should have been what I now am a moderate Tory a supporter as far as my little influence extends of a wellpoised balance between the crown and people but should the scale preponderate against the  Salus populi  that moment may it be said  The dog's a Whig  SALISBURYCOURT  FARTHER to the west of  White Friars  is  Salisburycourt  once the inn or city mansion of the bishops of  Salisbury  afterwards of the  Sackvilles  held at first by a long lease from the see and then  changed by bishop  Jewel  for a valuable consideration from that great family It was successively called  Sackvillehouse  and  Dorsethouse  The great lord  Buckhurst  created by  James  I earl of  Dorset  wrote here his  Porrex and Ferrex  a tragedy  DORSETHOUSE  which was performed at  Whitehall  before queen  Elizabeth  He was equally great as a statesman and author Here also died two of his successors the last was the gallant earl of whom lord  Clarendon  gives so great a character who retired here on the murder of his royal master and never after quitted the place  THE house being pulled down  THEATRE  was succeeded by other buildings among which was a magnificent theatre built after the Restoration by Sir  Christopher Wren  in which the company of comedians called the duke of  York  's servants performed under the patentee Sir  William Davenant  Here  Betterton  and the best actors of the time entertained the public till its taste grew so depraved that the new manager Doctor  Davenant  was obliged to call in aid music and rich scenery to support his house  THE church of  St Bride  's with its fine steeple built by the same great architect but lost in the various houses of the street  ST BRIDE'S CHURCH  stands farther on on the south side It was dedicated to  St Bridget  whether she was  Irish  or whether she was  Scotch  whether she was maiden or whether she was wife I will not dare to determine the contest Her church was originally small but by the piety of  William Viner  warden of the  Fleet  about the year was enlarged with a body and sideailes and ornamented with grapes and vineleaves in allusion to his name It was destroyed by the great fire and rebuilt soon after in its present form  NOT far from this church lived the famous printer  Wynkyn de  Worde  at his inn or house the  Faulcon  but I find he enprynted his  Fruyte of Tymes  in at the sygne of the sonne in  Fleetstreet  BRIDEWELL  NOT far from the  White Friars  near the west side of  Fleetditch  was a well dedicated to one of the  St Brides  or  Bridgets  This gave name to the parishchurch and the ancient palace of  Bridewell  which was honored with the residence of several of our monarchs even as early as king  John  It was formed partly out of the remains of an antient castle  ARX PALATINA  the western  Arx Palatina  of the city which stood near the little river  Fleet  near to the  Thames  In  William  the Conqueror gave many of the choicest materials towards the rebuilding of  St Paul  's cathedral which had been destroyed by fire And  Henry  I gave as many of the stones from the walls of the castleyard as served to inclose and form the gates and precinct of the church Notwithstanding this the dwelling remained and became the residence of several of our monarchs  Stow's Survaie    Dugdale's St Paul's    To this palace that arbitrary prince convened all the abbots and other heads of religious houses  English  and foreign and squeezed out of them a hundred thousand pounds in those days an enormous sum From the  Cistercians  who would not own his supremacy not less than thirtythree thousand  Henry  VIII rebuilt the palace in a most magnificent manner for the reception of the emperor  Charles  V who visited  England  in After all the expence the emperor lodged in  Black Friars  and his suite in the new palace and a gallery of communication was flung over the ditch and a passage cut through the city wall  into the emperor's apartments The king often lodged here particularly in when the question of his marriage with queen  Catherine  was agitated at  Black Friars  It fell afterwards into decay and was begged by the pious prelate  Ridley  from  Edward  VI to be converted to some charitable purpose  HOUSE OF CORRECTION  That of a house of correction was determined on for vagabonds of each sex and all denominations The first time I visited the place there was not a single male prisoner and about twenty female They were confined on a groundfloor and employed in beating of hemp When the door was opened by the keeper they ran towards it like so many hounds in kennel and presented a most moving sight about twenty young creatures the eldest not exceeding sixteen many of them with angelic faces divested of every angelic passion and featured with impudence impenitency and profligacy and cloathed in the silken tatters of squalid finery A magisterial a national opprobriumWhat a disadvantageous contrast to the  Spinhuis  in  Amsterdam  where the confined sit under the eye of a matron spinning or sewing in plain and neat dresses provided by the public No trace of their former lives appears in their countenances a thorough reformation seems to have been effected equally to the emolument and honor of the republic This is also the place of confinement for disobedient and idle apprentices They are kept separate in airy cells and have an allotted task to be performed in a certain time They the men and women are employed in beating hemp picking oakum and packing of goods and are said to earn their maintenance  BUT  Bridewell  is not only a prison for the dissolute  A HOUSE OF INDUSTRY  but a hospital  for the education of the industrious youth Here twenty Arts masters as they are styled consisting of decayed tradesmen such as shoemakers taylors flaxdressers and weavers have houses and receive apprentices who are instructed in several trades the masters receiving the profit of their labors After the boys have served their time with credit they are payed ten pounds to begin the world with and are entitled to the freedom of the city They are dressed in blue with a white hat The procession of these and the children of  Christ's Hospital  on  Easter Monday  and  Tuesday  to  St Bride  's church affords to the humane the most pleasing spectacle as it excites the reflection of the multitudes thus rescued from want profligacy and perdition The number of vagrants and other indigent and miserable people received into this house the last year was seven hundred and sixteen many of whom had physic and other relief as their necessities required at the expence of the hospital  COURT OF JUSTICE  SOME of the original building yet remains as does the magnificent flight of antient stairs which leads to the present court of justice which is a handsome apartment Contiguous to it is the room of punishment but in our mild country no other instrument is to be seen in it but a large whipping stocks This is said to have been the place in which the sentence of divorce was pronounced against the worthy princess which had been concluded on in the opposite monastery  HALL FINE PICTURE BY HOLBEIN  THE hall opens into the courtroom Over the chimney is the celebrated portrait of  Edward  VI by  Holbein  representing that monarch bestowing the charter of  Bridewell  to Sir  George Barnes  the lord mayor by him is  William  earl of  Pembroke  a great  favorite and distinguished character and  Thomas Goodrich  bishop of  Ely  and lord chancellor of  England  and in a corner is the head of the celebrated painter There are doubts whether this picture was completed by  Holbein  for his death and that of the king very soon followed the solemnity it records  SIR  William Withers  lord mayor of  London  is painted represented on horseback He was president in and bestowed on this hospital the iron gates and marble pavement  SIR  William Turner  in long hair furred robe and gold chain the face very fine This gentleman was lord mayor in a native of  Kirk Leedham  in  Yorkshire  and a most liberal benefactor to his native place He was painted by Mr  Beale  for Mr  Knollys  who presented it to the governors of  Bridewell  ANOTHER portrait of Sir  Robert Geoffry  with long wig and furred robes dated Two very fine portraits of  Charles  II sitting and  James  II standing by  Lely  Finally a picture of  Slingsby Bethel  esq  lord mayor in the last work of the painter  Hudson  THE creek called  Fleetditch  FLEETDITCH  had its entrance from the  Thames  immediately below  Bridewell  and reached as far as  Holbornbridge  at the foot of  Holbornhill  and received into it the little river  Fleet Turnmill  brook and another called  Oldbourn  which gave name to that vast street The tide flowed up as high as  Holbornbridge  and brought up barges of considerable burden Over it were four stone bridges and on the sides extensive quays and warehouses It was of such utility that it was scoured and kept open at vast expence and not later than near twentyeight thousand pounds were expended for that purpose  IN the performing of this work at the depth of fifteen feet were found several  Roman  utensils and a little deeper a great quantity of  Roman  coins in silver copper brass and other metals but none in gold At  Holbornbridge  were found two brazen  Lares  about four inches long one a  Bacchus  the other a  Ceres  It is a probable conjecture that these were thrown in by the affrighted  Romans  at the approach of the enraged  Boadicia  who soon took ample revenge on her insulting conquerors Here were also found numbers of  Saxon  antiquities spurs weapons keys seals c also medals crosses and crucifixes which might likewise have been flung in on occasion of some alarm  THIS canal was afterwards neglected and became a nusance was filled up and a sewer formed beneath to convey the water to the river The fine market which extends the whole length of the old ditch rose in its place in in which year an act was passed to empower the lord mayor and citizens to fill up the ditch at their own expence and to vest the seesimple of the ground in them and their successors for ever I recollect the present noble approach to  Blackfriarsbridge  the wellbuilt opening of CHATHAMPLACE a muddy and genuine ditch This had been the mouth of the creek which as  Stow  informs us in was of depth and width sufficient  that ten or twelve ships navies at once with merchandizes were wont to come to the aforesaid bridge of  Fleete  Survay of  London  p    It must be recollected that at this period there were drawbridges upon  Londonbridge  through which ships of a certain size might pass and discharge their cargoes in the mouth of the  Fleet  THIS end of  Blackfriarsbridge  now fills the filthy mouth of  Fleetditch  BLACKFRIARSBRIDGE  This elegant structure was built after the design of Mr  Robert Mylne  It consists of nine arches the center of which is a hundred feet wide The whole length nine hundred and ninetyfive feet the breadth of the carriageway twentyeight feet of the two footways seven each Over each pier is a recess an apology for the beautiful pairs of  ionic  pillars which support them The effect of this singular application of columns is beautiful from the river The equinoctial tides rise here to the heighth of eighteen or twenty feetThe first stone of this bridge was laid on  October  th and it was completed about the latter end of the year at the expence of £  s    d  Mr  Northouk  The magnificent prospect from the top is so well described in the  Tour through London  Printed for  J Wallis  a little book that no walker of taste should be without that I must refer my reader to that judicious and pleasing compilation to which I freely acknowlege my frequent obligation  ON the east side of  Fleetmarket  stands the  Fleetprison  FLEETPRISON  for debtors founded at lest as early as the first of  Richard  I It was also the place of confinement for such who had incurred the displeasure of that arbitrary court the Star Chamber This prison became such a scene of cruelty that in the year a most benevolent set of gentlemen prototypes of the GOOD HOWARD formed themselves into a committee to search into the horrors of the gloomy gaol  Unpitied and unheard where misery moans  Where sickness pines where thirst and hunger burns  And poor misfortune feels the lash of vice  While in the land of liberty The land  Whose every street and public meeting glow  With open freedom little tyrants rag'd  Snatch'd the lean morsel from the starving mouth  Tore from cold wint'ry limbs the tatter'd weed  Even robb'd them of the last of comforts sleep  The freeborn  Briton  to the dungeon chain'd  Or as the lust of cruelty prevail'd  At pleasure mark'd him with inglorious stripes  And crush'd out lives by secret barbarous ways  THOMSON  All these barbarities were realized The House of Commons the year preceding had taken up the enquiries  See State Trials vol ix page  and found that  Huggins  warden of the  Fleet  and  Bambridge  his deputy and  William Acton  turnkey had exercised most shocking cruelties Those monsters were tried for the murder of five unhappy men who died under the most horrid treatment from them Yet notwithstanding the prosecution was recommended from the throne and conducted by the ablest lawyers to the concern of all good men these wretches escaped their merited punishment  The same pages For farther particulars respecting this prison see Mr HOWARD on Prisons octavo    PROFLIGATE MARRIAGES  IN walking along the street in my youth on the side next to this prison I have often been tempted by the question  Sir will you be pleased to walk in and be married  Along this most lawless space was hung up the frequent sign of a male and female hand conjoined with  Marriages performed within  written beneath  A dirty fellow invited you in The parson was seen walking before his shop a squalid profligate figure clad in a tattered plaid nightgown with a fiery face and ready to couple you for a dram of gin or roll of tobacco Our great chancellor lord HARDWICK put these  daemons  to flight and saved thousands from the misery and disgrace which would be entailed by these extemporary thoughtless unions  I SHALL now give a general view of the  Walls  CITY WALLS  the antient defence of the city and of the  Townditch  a work of considerable labor In my progress I shall point out whatsoever was remarkable in the adjacent suburbs or the parts within the city which border on the walls There never was any alteration made in the course of this first precinct which was preserved through all succeeding ages and in every reparation or additional strength which was thought necessary Its direction was from the first irregular The  Romans  as was frequently the case consulted the necessity of the ground  Vegetius  It commenced at the  Palatinetower  ran in a strait line along the eminence of  Ludgatehill  and above  Fleetditch  as far as  Newgate  then suddenly was carried northerly to a spot a little beyond  Aldersgate  and at that place ran strait in a northern direction almost to  Cripplegate  from whence it resumed a strait eastern course as far as  Bishopsgate  in which a long remnant of the wall still called  London Wall  is to be seen From  Bishopsgate  it assumes a gentle curvature pointed to the  Tower  over the site of which it originally passed and probably finished in a  Castellum  in this as it did in the western extremity Another wall guarded the river and ran the whole length  of the south side of the city on the direction of the vast street called  Thamesstreet  But all this I shall particularize in my walk round the antient walls  TOWNDITCH  I SHALL first mention another considerable addition to the strength of those fortifications The  Townditch  was a stupendous piece of work began in the reign of king  John  in by the  Londoners  themselves possibly as a protection against their own monarch who in resentment to them had just removed the Exchequer to  Northampton  It was two hundred feet broad and extended on the outside of the walls from  Towerditch  quite to  Christ's Hospital  Notwithstanding the multitude of hands employed it was not finished in less than two years It was filled with water as is evident from the quantity of good fish  Stow  informs us was taken in it  Survaie  i p  The citizens for some centuries were at great expence in cleansing and keeping it open but after the last attempt in the work was given over it became stable land and was soon covered with buildings  THE western wall terminated near the river with a sort which I apprehend to have been the castle of  Montfitchet  soon to be mentioned  BLACK FRIARS  WITHIN the walls opposite to  Bridewell  stood the great house of  Black Friars  or  Dominicans  founded by the interest and exhortations of  Robert Kilwarby  archbishop of  Canterbury  about when  Gregory Rocksley  and the barons of  London  presented him with the ground  Edward  I and his queen  Elianor  became great benefactors by the assistance of whom the archbishop built the monastery and a large church richly ornamented  This obtained every immunity which any religious house had Its precinct was very large had four gates and contained numbers of shops the inhabitants of which were subject only to the king the superior of the house and their own justices It also became a sanctuary for debtors and even malefactors a privilege which it preserved even long after the suppression of religious houses  To make way for this foundation two lanes were pulled down and part of the city wall which last was rebuilt immediately by a charter granted by  Edward  I for that purpose  CASTLE OF MONTFICHET  The castle of  Montfichet  also fell a sacrifice to this house It was built by  Gilbert de Montfichet  a follower of the Conqueror and growing ruinous by gift of the king the materials were used for the building of the church on the site of this antient tower The church became a fashionable place of interment of people of rank and to be buried in the habit of the order was thought to be a sure preservative against the attacks of the devil Among other illustrious personages was  Hubert de Burgh  earl of  Kent  and his wife  Margaret  sister to  Alexander  II king of  Scotland  the heart of queen  Elianor  lord  Fanhope  that patron of learning  John Tiptoft  earl of  Worcester  beheaded in  James Touchet  earl of  Audley  beheaded in Sir  Thomas Brandon  knight of the Garter  William Courteney  earl of  Devonshire  and much other great and noble dust  IN the same church were also held several parlements The remarkable one of in the reign of  Henry  VI was adjourned from  Westminster  to this place here the weak monarch vainly endeavoured to divert the storm raised by his subjects against the favorite of his queen  William de la Pole  duke of  Suffolk  and by a poor expedient a simulated  exile  drove him to instant death  HERE in  Henry  VIII held another in order to oppress his subjects with an aid of eight hundred thousand pounds to carry on his imprudent wars The virtue of the commons resisted the demand and gave him ony a moderate tax This was called the  Black  parlement as it began amongst the  Black Monks  at  Westminster  and ended among the  Black Friars  HERE cardinal  Campeggio  and cardinal  Wolsey  sat in as judges and legates on the question of divorce between  Henry  and the illfated princess  Catherine  of  Arragon Henry  and his queen at that time residing in the palace of  Bridewell  ready to attend the farcical citations of that court And in this place  Wolsey  himself fell from all his greatness for here began the parlement which gave the sentence of  premunire  the last stroke to all his prosperity  WITH all the great events which honored this house its revenues at the dissolution were only one hundred pounds fifteen shillings and five pence Bishop  Fisher  held it  in commendam  and in with fifteen brethren surrendered it to the king  Edward  VI afterwards granted it to Sir  Thomas Cawarden  IN the reign of queen  Elizabeth  the  Black Friars  became a place much inhabited by people of fashion Among others lord  Herbert  son of  William  fourth earl of  Worcester  had a house here which queen  Elizabeth  in honored with her presence on occasion of his nuptials with the daughter and heiress of  John  lord  Russel  son of  Francis  earl of  Bedford  The queen was met at the waterside by the bride and carried to her house in a  lectica  by six knights her majesty dined there and supped in the same neighborhood with lord  Cobham  where there was  a memorable maske of ladies and a straunge dawnce new invented  Their attire is this each hath a skirt of cloth of silver a rich wastcoat wrought with silkes and gold and silver a mantell of carnacion taffete cast under the arme and there haire loose about there shoulders curiously knotted and interlaced Mrs  Fitton  leade these ladys maskets choose ladies more to dawnce the measures Mrs  Fitton  went to the queen and woed her dawnce her majesty the love of  Essex  rankling in her breast asked what she was  Affection  she said  Affection  said the queen  Affection  is false Yet her majestie rose up and dawnced  Sydney Papers  ii    At this time the queen was sixty surely as Mr WALPOLE observed it was at that period as natural for her to be in loveI must not forget that in her passage from the bride's to lord  Cobham  's she went through the house of Doctor  Puddin  and was presented by the doctor with a fanThe  Count de Tillier  ambassador of  France  in the latter end of the reign of  James  I resided here During his residence in  England  the dreadful accident called the  Fatal Vespers  happened near his house A celebrated preacher of the order of the Jesuits father  Drury  FATAL VESPERS  gave a sermon to a large audience of  British  subjects in a spacious room up three pair of stairs In the midst of the discourse the floor fell and ninetyfour persons besides the preacher perished It is disgusting to reflect on the uncharitable bigotry of the times The  Protestants  considered the accident as a judgment on the  Catholics  for their idolatry the  Catholics  attributed it to a plot of the  Protestants  to bring destruction on their dissenting brethren  APOTHECARIESHALL is within this precinct  APOTHECARIESHALL  a large and  handsome building in which medicines of all kinds are prepared and sold at a cheap rate here also are made up the chests of medicines for the army and navy It was finished in but I am not acquainted with the time of the first establishment of this useful institution perhaps in that of  James  I there being in the hall the portrait of that monarch and a bust of his apothecary  Gideon Dilaune  KING'S PRINTINGHOUSE  WITHIN this district was the  King's Printinghouse  in which bibles common prayers proclamations and every thing respecting the public were heretofore printed Here in the time of  Charles  I was made that dreadful omission in the seventh commandment of  Thou  SHALT  commit adultery  for which archbishop  Laud  very properly laid a heavy fine on the Stationers company to whom the printing of the sacred book is committed by patent The SPECTATOR wittily observes that he fears that many young profligates of both sexes are possessed of this spurious edition and observe the commandment according to that faulty reading  LUDGATE  THE first gate in this southern part of the walls is  Ludgate  which stood on the middle of  Ludgatehill  This and every other gate in the city are at present pulled down  Templebar  excepted  Ludgate  was built during the wars of the barons with king  John  in they entered the city and destroyed the houses of the devoted  Jews  and with their houses repaired the walls and built this gate When it was taken down to be rebuilt in a stone with this inscription in  Hebrew  was found lodged in the wall  This is the ward of  Rabbi Moses  the son of the honorable  Rabbi Isaac  It was in my memory a wretched prison for debtors it commenced what was called a freeprison in but soon lost that privilege It was enlarged  and had the addition of a chapel by Sir  Stephen Forster  on a very romantic occasion He himself had been confined there and begging at the grate was accosted by a rich widow who asked him what sum would purchase his liberty She payed it down took him into her service and afterward married him In the chapel was an inscription in honor of him and  Agnes  his wife dated the year in which he enjoyed the honor of being lord mayor of the city  THIS gate gave a conclusion to the rebellion of Sir  Thomas Wyat  When he had with some loss led his forces along the  Strand  and  Fleetstreet  in hopes of being joined by the citizens he found it shut against him and strongly manned seized with despondency he retreated a little down the hill and flinging himself on a bench opposite to the inn called  The Bell Savage  began to repent the rashness of his enterprize and lament his folly He was summoned by a herald to submit which he agreed to requesting that it might be to a gentleman and accordingly yielded himself into the hard of Sir  Maurice Berkely  or Sir  Clement Parton  Fuller  's Church History book xvi p    THE  Bell Savage  continues an inn to this day  BELL SAVAGE  but the sign is disused  Stow  says that it received its name from one  Isabella Savage  who had given the house to the company of Cutlers The painter gave it a very diverting origin deriving it from a  Bell  and a  Wild Man  so painted a bell with a savage man standing by it The SPECTATOR alone gives the real derivation which is from  La Belle Sauvage  a beautiful woman described in an old  French  romance as being found in a wilderness in a savage state  Spectator  vol i N  o      OLD BAILEY  ON the outside of  Ludgate  the street called the  Old Bailey  runs parallel with the walls as far as  Newgate  In this street stood  Sydneyhouse  at present occupied by a coachmaker once the residence of the  Sydnies  till they removed to  Leicesterhouse  Mr  Brooke Somerset  Herald  The Sessionshouse in which criminals of the county of  Middlesex  and the whole capital are tried is a very elegant building erected within these few years The entrance into the area is narrow to prevent a sudden ingress of mob Above it is the figure of Justice Every precaution has been taken to keep the court airy and to prevent the effect of the effluvia arising from that dreadful disorder the gaolfever The havoke it made in  May  was a melancholy admonition to those interested in every court of justice My respected kinsman Sir  Samuel Pennant  lord mayor baron  Clark  Sir  Thomas Abney  judge of the common pleas the under sheriff some of the counsel and several of the jury and of other persons died of this putrid distemper Several of these fatal accidents have happened in this kingdom which makes the surprize the greater that the neglect of the salutary precautions was continued till the time of this awakening callMR HOWARD has given us a view and plan of the great gaol of  Newgate  as now rebuilt Some of the defects of the old one are remedied but this FRIEND TO MANKIND seems still to think it is not free from errors and that without great care the prisoners are yet liable to the fatal fever the result of one of those errors  State of Prisons to edition    SURGEONS THEATER  BY a sort of second sight the Surgeons Theatre was built near this court of conviction and  Newgate  the concluding stage  of the lives forfeited to the justice of their country several years before the fatal tree was removed from  Tyburn  to its present site It is a handsome building ornamented with  ionic  pilasters and with a double flight of steps to the first floor Beneath them is a door for the admission of the bodies of murderers and other felons who noxious in their lives make a sort of reparation to their fellowcreatures by becoming useful after death  THE new prison which retains the name of  Newgate  NEWGATE  from the gate which till within these few years formed a part of it is immediately beyond the Sessionshouse a massy building with an extensive front of rusticwork with all the appearance of strength and security Yet in the infamous riots of the felons confined even in the strongest holds were released stones of two or three tons in weight to which the doors of their cells were fastened were raised by that resistless species of crow wellknown to housebreakers by the name of the  Pig'sfoot  Such was the violence of the fire that the great iron bars of the windows were eaten through and the adjacent stones vitrified  THE gate stood a little beyond this building  WHEN BUILT  as a military way has been traced under it there can be no doubt but there had been one during the time the city was possessed by the  Romans  but the place had been made up and no vestiges of it left The gate which supplied its place is supposed by  Stow  to have been erected between the years and when  Richard Beauveyes  bishop of  London  by enlarging the precincts of  St Paul  's had obstructed the usual way under  Ludgate  and made this new outlet necessary Mr  Howel  says that the original name was  Chamberlaingate  It had been for ages a prison even as long as  the year and for persons of rank long before the  Tower  was used for that purpose  Robert Baldock  chancellor to  Edward  III was sent there where says  Fabian  he ended his days miserably  Chr vol ii part vii  Sir  Thomas Percie  lord  Egremond  and other people of distinction were committed to that prison in In this gate was rebuilt by the executors of the famous Sir  Richard Whittington  out of the effects he had allotted for works of charity his statue with the cat remained in a nich to its final demolition on the rebuilding of the present prison It was destroyed in the fire of and rebuilt in its late form It had one great arch and one postern for passengers and on each side a half hexagon tower  NEW COMPTER  TO the north of  Newgate  immediately across the street and with the east end of  St Sepulchre  's church forming the entrance of  Giltspurstreet  is lately built a vast pile of a proper strength and simplicity intended to supply the place of one or both of the city prisons called  Compters  This with the edifices just mentioned form all together a superb but melancholy group of public buildings and are a noble improvement of this spot which a few years ago was much incumbered with a number of old houses interrupting the free course of the air the view and the intercourse of passengers  NEWGATESTREET  IN  Newgatestreet  over the entrance into  Bagniocourt  is a small sculpture in stone of  William Evans  gigantic porter to  Charles  I and his diminutive fellowservant  Jeffry Hudson  dwarf to the same monarch It was probably by his own consent that the latter was put into the pocket of the giant and drawn out by him  King Charles  st  Porter Dwarf  M PA  THE KINGS PORT  Boar in East Cheap  IT  J  Sculpture in

duel who had ventured to ridicule the irritable hero  Evans  was seven feet and a half high  Hudson  only three feet nine inches  THE  Bagnio  in this court seems the first we had in our capital  BAGNIOS  a neat contrived building says  Strype  after the  Turkish  fashion for the purposes of sweating and hotbathing and much approved by the physicians of the time It probably was somewhat of the nature of  Dominicetti  's plan At length it became besides a sort of  Hotel  or lodginghouse for any short space This and the  Hummums  in  Coventgarden  were the only houses of the kind which supported a fair character till  Pero  's in  St James'sstreet  was set up since which the conveniency of  Hotels  on the  French  model is universally experienced  IN the wall of a house in  Pannierall  y  in this or rather  Blowbladderstreet  is a figure in  one of a naked boy sitting on something like a pannier and beneath is this inscription  When you have sought the citty round  Yet still this is the highest ground  Aug    The stone has very much the appearance of an antient sepulchral one and might have had the inscription cut on it to inform the public of the elevated situation of the place  CHURCH OF ST SEPULCHRE  THE church of  St Sepulchre  or the holy sepulchre beforementioned stands at a small distance from the site of the gate on the north side of  Snowhill  It was dedicated to the holy sepulchre at  Jerusalem  but whether the original church which was of a great size and long since demolished was of the form of that in  Judea  is unknown It was rebuilt in the reign of  Henry  VI or  Edward  IV  Popham  chancellor of  Normandy  who is mentioned as having been buried in the church of the  Chartreux  was a great benefactor to this church The famous captain  John Smith  who perhaps underwent more romantic adventures and deeds of arms than any man who ever existed rested here in from his turmoils I refer to his history for his wondrous acts of chivalry for the kindness he experienced among the  Turks  from the beauteous lady  Tragebysanda  the charitable lady  Calamata  and the blessed  Pokahontas  the great king of  Virginia  's daughter  A SOLEMN exhortation was formerly given to the prisoners appointed to die at  Tyburn  in their way from  Newgate  Mr  Robert Dow  merchant taylor who died in left  s    d  yearly for ever that the bellman should deliver from the wall to the unhappy criminals as they went by in the cart a most pious and aweful admonition And also another in the prison of  Newgate  on the night before they suffered I give them in the note as they are affectingly good  ADMONITION TO THE PRISONERS IN NEWGATE ON THE NIGHT BEFORE EXECUTION  You prisoners that are within  Who for wickedness and sin  after many mercies shewn you are now appointed to die tomorrow in the forenoon noon give ear and understand that to morrow morning the greatest bell of  St Sepulchre  's shall toll for you in form and manner of a passing bell as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death to the end that all godly people hearing that bell and knowing it is for year going to your deaths may be stirred up he  rtily to pray to GOD to bestow his grace and mercy upon you whilst you live I beseech you for JESUS CHRIST's sake to keep this night in watching and prayer to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy as knowing to morrow you must appear before the judgmentseat of your Creator there to give an account of all things done in this life and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against him unless upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance you find mercy through the merits death and passion of your only mediator and advocate JESUS CHRIST who now sits at the right hand of God to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to him  ADMONITION TO THE CONDEMNED CRIMINALS AS THEY ARE  ING BY ST SEPULCHRE's CHURCHWALL TO EXECUTION  All good people pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners who are now going to their death for whom this great bell doth toll  You that are condemned to die repent with lamentable tears ask mercy of the Lord for the salvation of your own souls through the merits death and passion of JESUS CHRIST who now sits at the right hand of God to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto him  LORD have mercy upon you  CHRIST have mercy upon you  LORD have mercy upon you  CHRIST have mercy upon you    FROM a little beyond  Newgate  the walls take a northeasternly direction as far as  Aldersgate  I STILL pursue my journey along the northern suburbs pass into  Aldersgatestreet  near the site of its antient gate  Aldersgatestreet  is open and airy and remarkable for the antiquity of several of its houses  LONDONHOUSE  Londonhouse  the residence of the later bishops of the diprese is now no more its place is covered with the warehouses of Mr  Sedd    the greatest and most elegant repository of goods in the article of the cabinet manufactory in the world  Stow  informs us it was once called  Petrehouse  having been the property of the lords  Petre  an ancestor of theirs Sir  William Petre  who died in was a benefactor to the parish of  St Botclph Aldersgate  Collins's Peerage  vii  in which the family resided I do not know the time when the family alienated the place or when it became the residence of the bishops of  London  but suspect that they occupied their palace near  St Paul  's till it was destroyed in the great fire  Londonhouse  has long since been sold under the powers of an act of parlement and the house in  St James'ssquare  the present townhouse of the bishops of  London  purchased for their use The last tenant of  Londonhouse  was I think old  Rawlinson  the nonjuring titular bishop of  London  who rented it He died about twenty years ago and left his antiquities to the university of  Oxford  THANETHOUSE  ALMOST opposite to  Londonhouse  is  Thanethouse  It was first called  Dorchesterhouse  having been the residence of the marquis of  Dorchester  Strype's Stow  i book iii  In after times the town seat of the  Tuftons  earls of  Thanet  a magnificent old house built about the time of  Charles  I It was hired or purchased by the incendiary statesman lord  Shaftsbury  for the purpose of living in the city to inflame  the minds of the citizens among whom he used to boast he could raise ten thousand brisk boys by the holding up of his finger He attempted to get into the magistracy but being disappointed in his views and terrified at the apprehension of the detection of a conspiracy he had entered into against his prince fled in into  Holland  where he soon died of the gout heightened by rage and frustrated ambition  When he was in power he urged the  Dutch  war with uncommon animosity and always concluded his speeches with  Delenda est Carthago  When he fled into  Holland  he was so fearful of being given up that he solicited to be made burgess of  Amsterdam  in order to secure his person The magistrates conferred on him that privilege with these remarkable words  A nostra  CARTHAGINE  non  um deletâ  SALUTEM ACCIPE  This house after undergoing various fortunes in was converted into a lyingin hospital a most humane institution supported by voluntary contributions which doth great honor to its patrons  IN this street was also the town house of the  Nevils  WESTMORELAND AND NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSES  earls of  Westmoreland  a magnificent pile now frittered into various tenements but still keeps its name under that of  Westmoreland court  The other great northern family was lodged not far from hence but within the walls in a street now called  BullandMouth street  the  Percies  earls of  Northumberland  but the business of those potent peers was chiefly in the camp for they seldom visited town but to brave the sovereign or the favorite  LAUDERDALEHOUSE stood on the east side of the northern end of the street It was the town seat of the duke of  Lauderdale  LAUDERDALEHOUSE  but its place is now covered with the distillery belonging to Messrs  Bote  and  Walsh  THE  BullandMouth Inn  not far from the site of the gate must not be passed by on account of the wonderful perversion of the name It originally signifies the mouth of  Boulogne Harbour  which grew into a popular sign after the costly capture of that place by  Henry  VII  BARBICAN  THE  Barbican  which I mentioned at page as originally a  Roman Specula  or watchtower lay a little to the north of this street It was an appendage to most fortified places The  Saxons  gave them the title of  Burghkenning  They were esteemed so important that the custody was always committed to some man of rank This was entrusted to the care of  Robert Ufford  earl of  Suffolk  by  Edward  III by the name of  Basecourt  which descended by the marriage of  Cecilia  one of his daughters to Sir  John Willoughby  afterwards lord  Willoughby  of  Parham  In the reign of queen  Mary  it was possessed by  Catherine  widow of  Charles Brandon  duke of  Suffolk  in her own right baroness  Willoughby  of  Ereshy  and then wife of  Thomas Bertie  ancestor of the duke of  Ancaster  this lady in her zeal against popery had dressed a dog in a rochet or surplice used by bishops and in affront to bishop  Gardiner  had named a dog after him  C  llin  's P  rage  ii  This induced her and her husband to quit their house at the  Barbican  and retire into foreign parts till the danger was over The mansion was called  Willoughbyhouse  was of a great size and inhabited by her son who was called  Peregrine  because he happened to be born abroad during the flight of his parents  BRIDGEWATERHOUSE  THE earls of  Bridgewater  had also a house in the  Barbican  called after their title It was burnt down in and lord  Brackley  eldest son of the then earl and a younger brother with their tutor unfortunately perished in the flames The site is now called  Bridgewatersquare  or garden It was in the last century at the time  Newcastle  was besieged celebrated for its orchards productive of such quantities of fruits says Mr EVELYN as never were produced before or after that time Mr EVELYN attributes this to the decrease of smoke resulting from the scarcity of coal in the capital from that event He inveighs with great indignation at the increase of that species of fuel and at the introduction of so many manufactories productive of smoke which not only deformed our noblest buildings with the sooty tinge but also from the quantity of coal brought on catarrhs coughs and consumptions in a degree unknown in  Paris  and other cities who make use of wood only His words are strong  The city of  London  says he  resembles rather the face of mount  Aetna  the court of  Vulcan Stromboli  or the suburbs of  Hell  than an assembly of rational creatures and the imperial seat of our incomparable monarch  EVELYN's  Fumifugium      The project of this good and able writer of supplying  London  with woodfires was certainly very humane but from the destruction of the woods even in his days was as little feasible as it would be at present  GARTERPLACE was another great house in this quarter  GARTERPLACE  It had been built by Sir  Thomas Writhe  or  Writhsley  garter king at arms and uncle to the first earl of  Southampton  Howel  's Londinopolis    ST ALBAN's church in  Woodstreet  I mention on account of  its antiquity having been founded in the time of king  Athelstan  or about  Stow  relates that  Roman  bricks were in his time to be seen mixed with the building  Vol i book iii    Athelstan  had also a house near which gave name to  Adelstreet  or  King Adelstreet  as it is called in old writings  Newcourt  i    HEAD OF JAMES V  IN this church flung among  Plebeian  sculls was the head of the unfortunate  James  V of  Scotland  His body for a long time had remained embalmed at the monastery at  Shene  After the dissolution it was cast among some rubbish where some workmen wantonly cut off the head which was taken by  Young  glazier to queen  Elizabeth  who was struck with its sweetness arising from the embalming materials He kept it for some time at his house in  Woodstreet  but at last gave it to the sexton to bury among other bones in the charnelhouse  Howel    Such is often the end of ambitious greatness  REDCROSSSTREET  FROM the  Barbican Redcrossstreet  one of the antient streets points down towards  Cripplegate  In it the mitred abbot of  Ramsey  had his townhouse It was afterward called  Druryhouse  from its having been in aftertimes the residence of Sir  Drue Drury  ST GILES'S CRIPPLEGATE  ON approaching  Cripplegate  is the church of  St Egidius St Giles  That name always imports something of beggary accordingly this gate received its name from the number of cripples and beggars with which it was haunted formerly  St Giles  was their patron he was a noble  Athenian  and of so great charity as at  length to give away the very coat he wore on his back which he bestowed on a sick beggar who no sooner put it on but he was restored to health The same  legend  relates also to  St Martin  He had in this very street a fraternity founded by  Henry  V who built here for its use a handsome house In the church rest from their labors some of my brethren such as  John Speed  JOHN SPEED  the famous  English  historian and topographer and  Robert Glover  ROBERT GLOVER  Somerset  herald an indefatigable searcher of antiquities and the zealous  John Fox  the famous martyrologist  JOHN FOX  NOT far from this church within the walls in  Monkwellstreet  BARBER SURGEONSHALL  stands  Barber Surgeonshall  which is esteemed one of the best works of  Inigo Jones  The theatre for the operations is elliptical and finely contrived Since the separation of the company of the surgeons from that of the barbers the building is in a manner deserted Originally the chirurgic art and that of shaving went in this city hand in hand as they do to this day in several parts of  Europe  The barbers were first incorporated by  Edward  IV in but prior to that they had been formed into a body by  Thomas Morestead  surgeon to  Henry  IV V and VI who died in and the grant had been solicited by him  Jacques Fries  physician to  Edward  IV and  John Hobbes  his physician and surgeon at length it was incorporated by that prince and his brother  Glocester  in the name of  St Cosme  and  Damianus  brethren physicians and martyrs The company prospered for some time till finding that numbers had crept in among them less skilled in the lancet than the razor from the want of power of examining into the skill of the chirurgical members they obtained a new charter from  Henry  VIII in which both professions were united A fine picture by  Holbein  PICTURE BY HOLBEIN  preserved in this  hall commemorates the event  Henry  in all his bluffness of majesty is represented giving them their new charter among them is Doctor  Butts  immortalized by  Shakespeare  in his play of  Henry  VIII There are seventeen of the company represented I refer to the  Gentleman's Magazine  for  April  for their names I may mention what the inquisitive author hath omitted that  John Chambre  physician to  Henry  VIII was in orders and was dean of the royal chapel and college adjoining to  Westminsterhall  and that  Thomas Vycary  was a citizen of  London  and serjeant surgeon to  Henry  VIII  Atkin  's Memoirs of Medicine  and the three succeeding sovereigns  Aylif  is another who had been sheriff of  London  and a merchant of  Blackwellhall  I relate part of his story from his epitaph  In surgery brought up in youth  A knight here lieth dead  A knight and eke a surgeon such  As  England  seld hath bred  For which so soveraigne gift of God  Wherein he did excell  King  Henry  VIII call'd him to court  Who lov'd him dearly well  King  Edward  for his service sake  Bade him rise up a knight  A name of praise and ever since  He Sir  John Ailife  hight  Strype's Stow  i book iii p    BY this charter barbers were not to practise surgery farther than drawing of teeth and surgeons were strictly prohibited from  the feat or craft of barbery or shaving Use was to make both perfect But by the year it having been discovered that the above arts were foreign to and independent of each other the barbers and the surgeons were by act of parlement separated and made distinct corporations It was very fit that an association which was now become ludicrous should be dissolved our surgeons began at that period to rise into great fame True it is that pupils then went to  Paris  to improve in the art at present  Europe  looks up to our surgeons as on the summit of the profession  IT will be curious to turn back from these times to those of  Henry  VIII to compare the state of surgery when at one time there were very few as  Gale  tells us worthy to be called surgeons His account of those employed in the army is very humorous "I remember" says he  when I was in the wars at  Muttrel Montreuil  in the time of that most famous prince king  Henry  VIII there was a great rabblement that took on them to be surgeons some were sowgelders and some horsegelders with tinkers and coblers This noble sect did such great cures that they got themselves a perpetual name for like as  Thessalus  's sect were called  Thessalions  so was this noble rabblement for their notorious cures called  Dogleaches  for in two dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and found for ever so that they neither felt heat nor cold nor no manner of pain after But when the duke of  Norfolk  who was then general understood how the people did die and that of small wounds he sent for me and certain other surgeons commanding us to make search how these men came to their death whether it were by the grievousness of their wounds or by the lack of knowledge of the surgeons and we according  to our commandment made search through all the camp and found many of the same good fellows which took upon them the names of surgeons not only the names but the wages also We asking of them whether they were surgeons or no they said they were we demanded with whom they were brought up and they with shameless faces would answer either with one cunning man or another which was dead Then we demanded of them what chirurgery stuff they had to cure men withal and they would shew us a pot or a box which they had in a budget wherein was such trumpery as they did use to grease horses heels withal and laid upon scabbed horses backs with rewal and such like And others that were coblers and tinkers they used shoemaker's wax with the rust of old pans and made therewithal a noble salve as they did term it But in the end this worthy rabblement was committed to the  Marshalsea  and threatened by the duke's grace to be hanged for their worthy deeds except they would declare the truth what they were and of what occupations and in the end they did confess as I have declared to you before  Atkin  's Memoirs of Medicine p    I must not overlook another picture  DR SCARBOROUGH  it is of Doctor  Scarborough  afterwards Sir  Charles  physician to  Charles  II  James  II and king  William  He was early appointed by the College of Physicians to read anatomical lectures at this hall He is dressed in the red gown hood and cap of a doctor in physic and is in the attitude of speaking one hand on his breast the other a little stretched out On the left is another figure the demonstrating surgeon dressed in the liverygown of the city of  London  whose business it  was to handle and shew the parts of the dissected bodies Accordingly he holds up the arm of a dead body placed on a table partly covered with a sheet with the  sternum  naked and laid bare and the pectoral muscles appearing He read these lectures with great applause sixteen or seventeen years and deservedly attained the character of the ablest physician of his time of great abilities and extensive learning  INSCRIPTION UNDER DR SCARBOROUGH'S PICTURE  Haec tibi  Scarburgi

of this part of the present  London  FINSBURY AND MOORFIELD    This tract was in the manor of  Finsbury  or rather  Fensbury  and in the days of the historian  Fitzstephen  was an errant fen of which he gives the following account in his description of the pastimes of the citizens in his time in which is given the aukward substitute of the skate "And" says the historian  when that vast lake which waters the walls of the city towards the north is hard frozen the youth in great numbers go to divert themselves on the ice some taking a small run for an increment of velocity place their feet at a proper distance and are carried sliding sideways a great way Others will make a large cake of ice and seating one of their companions upon it they take hold of one's hands and draw him along when it happens that moving swiftly on so slippery a plain they all fall headlong Others there are who are still more expert in these amusements on the ice they place certain bones the legbones of animals under the soles of their feet by tying them round their ankles and then taking a pole shod with iron into their hands they push themselves forward by striking it against the ice and are carried on with a velocity equal to the flight of a bird or a bolt discharged from a crossbow  Fitzstephen  c translated by an Antiquary    ON the north part of these fields stood the  Doggehouse  DOGHOUSE  in which were kept the hounds for the amusement of the lord mayor  Here resided the  Common Hunt  an officer the second in rank among those who formed the  Praetorian  establishment  Master Swordbearer  alone took place of him  Master Common Hunt  followed him and was to wait for his lordship's commands on  Mondays Wednesdays Fridays  and  Saturdays  Strype  's  Stow  ii book v p and his Survaie p    IT was in the time of  Edward  II of so little value that the whole was let at the rent of four marks a year It could only be passed over on causeways raised for the benefit of travellers In  Thomas Fauconer  mayor opened the postern in the wall called  Moorgate  MOORGATE  to give the citizens a passage into the country He also began to drain this watery tract In  Roger Atchley  mayor made further progress in the work  D  gda  e  on embanking  Successive attempts brought the ground into the state we see it at present most part of which except the stillneglected  Moorfields  is covered with streets  BETHLEM OR BEDLAM  BETWEEN  Bishopsgate  and  Moorfields  stood the hospital of  St Mary  of  Bethlem  founded by  Simon Fitzmary  sheriff of  London  in for a prior canons brethren and sisters of a peculiar order subject to the visitation of the bishop of  Bethlem  They were to be dressed in a black habit and distinguished by a star on their breast  Steven  's Suppl ii  In most of the houses belonging to this hospital were alienated and only the master left who did not wear the habit of the order It seems to have been instituted for the reception and cure of lunatics and had dependent on it some lesser houses  Stow  mentions one in  St Martin's in the Fields  but a  certain king disliking that persons under such unhappy circumstances should be so near the royal palace caused them to be removed to  Bethlem  without  Bishopsgate  In  Stephen Gennings  merchanttaylor with great humanity left by will forty pounds towards the purchasing of this hospital for the reception of lunatics The mayor and commonalty had taken some steps to execute his design but in were prevented by the munificence of their monarch who bestowed it on the city of  London  when it was converted to the humane purpose of receiving persons laboring under this most dreadful of maladies At first the medical relief excepted their expences were borne by their friends or their parishes but this edifice being found too small and growing ruinous in the lord mayor and aldermen removing the site to the present place began the noble hospital we now see and great as it is finished it in the next year at the expence of seventeen thousand pounds The front and wings extend five hundred and forty feet and make a magnificent appearance It was built on the plan of the palace of the  Tuilleries  at  Paris Louis  XIV was so incensed that his palace should be made the model for a lunatic hospital that it was said he ordered a plan of the palace of our monarch at  St James  's to be taken for offices of the vilest nature  Hist account c of  Bethlem Hospital  published in    THE humanity of our nation in was the cause that two large wings were added for the reception of  incurables  of which there were lately one hundred in that terrible state maintained within these walls The whole number of distracted people admitted in the last year was two hundred and twentyeight cured  and discharged a hundred and eightynine buried fourteen remained under cure two hundred and eighty  OVER the gates are two capital figures of raving and melancholy Madness the work of  Caius Gabriel Cibber  the father of the admirable comedian and wit  Colley Cibber Pope  satirizes himself when he makes these fine figures the mere vehicle of abuse on the son by calling them  His brazen brainless brothers  But  Colley Cibber  after very longsuffering took ample revenge in a short but bitter  Philippic  against our great poet which touched his pride so much as to contribute to bring him speedily to the grave  ST LUKE's HOSPITAL  OPPOSITE to  Bethlem Hospital  on the north side of  Moorfields  stood the hospital of  St Luke  a long plain building till of late appropriated to the same purposes but totally independant of the former It was founded on the humane consideration that  Bethlem  was incapable of receiving all the miserable objects which were offered Of late years the patients were removed from the old hospital to a new one erected under the same name in  Oldstreet  on the plan of the former extending in front three hundred and ninetythree feet Since the first admission of patients on  July  th to the same day three thousand six hundred and seventyfive have been admitted of which sixteen hundred and sixtyeight have been discharged cured and twelve hundred and two uncured The old hospital is now pulled down and replaced by a handsome row of houses By a very liberal regulation uncured patients may be taken in again on the payment of five shillings a week so that their friends may if they  please try a second time the force of medicine on their unhappy relations or connections  THE parish of  St Luke  's was taken out of that of  St Giles  's  Cripplegate  by an act in his late majesty's reign I mention it merely to direct the reader's attention to the steeple of the new church which terminates most singularly in a fluted obelisc  ON the west side of  Moorfields  is the  Artillery Ground  ARTILLERY GROUND  a large piece of ground laid out for the purpose of proving the artillery and for exercising the military belonging to the city It was originally in  Bishopsgatestreet  where some land belonging to the priory of  St Mary Spittle  was used for the same purpose  William  last prior of this house granted it for three ninetynine years to the fraternity of artillery or the gunners of the  Tower  for the practice of great and small ordnance and was long called the  Artillery Garden  This society was greatly patronised by  Henry  VIII his daughter  Elizabeth  favored it in a high degree as became a princess whose dominions were threatened with perpetual invasion from her potent rival The earl of  Warwick Ambrose Dudley  was master of the ordnance under him but more particularly under  William Thomas  master gunner of the queen's ship the  Victory  in the art was flung into system  Thomas  proposed to the council that the charter granted to the  Fraternity  by  Henry  should be confirmed and that the earl of  Warwick  should be governor and that a certain number of able gunners should be appointed to instruct in the art and that none should be appointed to any of her majesty's ships or forts but whom they should approve This plan was rejected and the ground remained to the gunners of the  Tower  Strype's Stow  i book ii p    ARTILLERY COMPANY  IN a new military society arose in the city which in those affrighted times finding itself grievously harrassed by continual musters and exercising of men found a remedy in the gallant spirit of several of the citizens A number among whom were many skilful officers who had served with credit abroad formed themselves into a respectable body of volunteers exercised themselves and trained others to the art of war Within two years there were near three hundred merchants and others capable of training and teaching soldiers the management of their pieces pikes and halbards to march countermarch and ring They made a considerable figure at the camp at  Tilbury  in the celebrated year After that time this useful discipline was neglected but in it revived and the volunteers became so numerous as to amount in time to six thousand men The old place of exercise being too small for the purpose they removed to the  New Artillery Ground  In the year there was a general muster and the citizens bravely furnished under twenty captains made a most creditable appearance In they began to build on one side an armoury which is excellently supplied  Charles  II when prince and his brother  James  duke of  York  entered into this company and on the Restoration the duke himself took the command and called it his own company The president and other officers consist of the leading persons in the city and one of the royal family is captaingeneral It consists of three hundred men  BESIDES this military force the city has six regiments of militia commanded by gentlemen of the first rank in the city these are under a lieutenancy peculiar to  London  and are exercised  IT was this body then known by the name of the  Trainedbands  which decided the fate of the civil war of the last century On every occasion they behaved with the spirit and perseverance of the most veteran troops They were commanded by  Skippon  captain of the  Artillery Garden  who had served long in  Holland  and raised himself from a common soldier to the rank of captain and proved himself an excellent officer From the service he had been in he came over with full prejudice against church and state so was greatly in the confidence of his party  Clarendon  ii  He was totally illiterate but his speeches to his soldiers had more weight in their ears than the finest oratory On marching to join the earl of  Essex  this was his speech  Come my boys my brave boys let us pray heartily and fight heartily I will run the same fortune and hazards with you Remember the cause is for GOD and for the defence of yourselves your wives and children Come my honest brave boys pray heartily and fight heartily and GOD will bless you  Whitelock's Memorials      ON the back of  Bethlem

sheriff of  London  and  Rosia  his wife for canons regular of the order of  St Augustine  It was noted for its pulpit cross at which a preacher was wont to preach a sermon consolidated out of four others which had been preached at  St Paul's Cross  on  Good Friday  and the  Monday Tuesday  and  Wednesday  in  Easter  week and then to give a sermon of his own At all which sermons the mayor and aldermen were to attend dressed on each occasion in different colored robes This custom continued till  the destruction of church government in the civil wars of the last century At the dissolution here were found not fewer than a hundred and fourscore beds well furnished for the reception of the poor  See page for an account of the antiquities found in these fields    THE great population of this part of the town called  Spittlefields  was owing to the blessed prosecutions of the  Hugonots  in the reign of  Louis le Grand  who sent thousands of his industrious subjects into our kingdom to transfer to his bitterest enemies the arts and manufactures of his own kingdom They flourished in this place to a great degree at present they suffer a temporary depression from the giddiness of

from its lord Sir  John de Sordich  a person deeply skilled in the laws and much trusted by  Edward  III and who was sent by him in to the pope  Clement  VI to remonstrate to his holiness against his clame of presenting to  English  livings and filling them with foreigners who never resided on their cures and drained the kingdom of its wealth This it may be easily supposed the pope took much amiss

Hogsden Pankridge  and  Shacklewell  who marched with all their train fantastically habited Near a thousand had gold chains and all were gorgeously attired The sum of archers were three thousand their

merchants certain privileges for which they were bound to support this gate Accordingly in it was elegantly rebuilt by them In memory of the founder and the first repairer there were two statues of bishops and besides two others conjectured to have been designed for  Alfred  and  Aeldred  earl of  Mercia  to whose care that great prince had committed the gate  NOT far without the gate stands an inn or tavern  WHITE HART  called the  White Hart  of most antient date not less than which is still perpetuated in large figures in the front but none of the original building appears to be left I believe there are but very few houses in  London  remaining of greater age than the time of queen  Elizabeth  or  James  I The great fire almost entirely destroyed those in the city In  Holborn Broad St Giles's  and  St John's  Lane Clerkenwell  are some old houses in  Catherine Wheel Alley  in this street is a very old house in a ruinous state and there are some also about  Templebar  It is no wonder that we have so few till about the year there were very few stone houses and none tiled or slated they were built with wood and thatched with straw or reeds In the year  Richard  I ordered that they should be built with stone to a certain height and that they should be covered with slate or burnt tile This order was repeated but it was long before it was obeyed This is not much to be wondered at for above a century afterwards such simplicity reigned that one  Peter Spileman  made fine for his lands to  Edward  II to find among other things  litter  for the king's bed and hay for his horse  Blunt  's Jocular Tenures last edition    HOUND  DITCH  I WILL continue my journey eastward from  Bishopssgate  On the outside parallel to the walls runs  Houndsditch  now a long street formerly a filthy ditch which took its name from being the place into which dead dogs and all manner of dirt was thrown Into it as worthy of no better sepulture was thrown the noble  Edric  the murderer of his master  Edmund Ironside  after having been drawn by his heels from  Baynard'scastle  and tormented to death by burning torches Here it was customary for pious people to walk on purpose to relieve the bedridden who lay on a ground floor covered with a neat cloth and with a pair of beads to shew to charitable passengers their helpless situation and that they were incapable of doing more than pray for them  DUKE'S PLACE  DUKE'S PLACE is a considerable place much inhabited by the  Jews  it stands on the site of the priory of the  Holy Trinity  or  Christchurch  founded in by  Matilda  wife to  Henry  I  PRIORY OF CHRISTCHURCH  the prior was always an alderman of  London  and of  Portsoken  ward who if he happened to be exceedingly pious appointed a substitute to transact temporal matters  Norman  was the first prior and he and his successors rode on solemn days with the aldermen but in their monastic habits This is said to have been the richest priory in  England  and possibly for that reason was selected to be the first which was dissolved  Fuller  's Church History book vi    Henry  VIII granted it to Sir  Thomas Audley  afterwards lord chancellor of  England  who inhabited the priory and died there in By the marriage of his daughter and sole heiress  Margaret  to  Thomas  duke of  Norfolk  it was conveyed into the  Howard  family and received the name of  Duke's Place  In he rode through the city with his dutchess to his residence here attended by a hundred horse in his livery with his gentlemen before him in coats guarded with velvet preceded by the four heralds  Clarencieux Somerset Red Cross  and  Blue Mantle  So respectable was the appearance of our ancient nobility  TWO gateways and some parts of the ruins of this priory may be still traced enveloped in more modern buildings some of the south transept may be discovered in certain houses from which it appears that the architecture was of the round arch or  Saxon  style  Mr  Carter  has made drawings of these remains    A CURIOUS investigator of antiquities hath lately recovered the beautiful little chapel of  St Michael  near  Aldgate  under the house of Mr  Relph  in  Leadenhallstreet  Gentleman's Magazine April  tab i  It is supposed to have  been built by prior  Norman  about the year in the  gothic  architecture Its dimensions are fortyeight feet by sixteen and is built with square pieces of chalk The arches are very elegant supported by ribs which converge and meet on the capitals of the pillars which are now nearly buried in the earth but are supposed to be covered with sixteen feet of soil The whole addition of soil since its foundation is supposed to have been twentysix feet an amazing increase which might almost occasion one to suspect it to have been the subchapel of some nowlost church  THE church of  St James Duke's Place  rose out of the ruins of this priory in the time of  James  I and the mayoralty of Sir  Edward Barkham  ALDGATE  EALDGATE or  Aldgate  which signifies  Old Gate  stands in the place where the wall forms an angle and takes a southerly direction and terminated in a postern near  Towerhill  It was one of the four principal gates the  Roman  road passed under it so one must have existed on the site in the earliest times It was also one of the seven that had double doors as was evident by the hinges which existed in the time of  Stow  Mention is made of it in the reign of  Edgar  by the name of  Ealdgate  In the fierce wars between king  John  and his barons the latter entered the city through this gate and committed great ravages among the houses of the religious Their chieftains repaired or rather rebuilt  Aldgate  after the  Norman  manner and made use of stone brought from  Caen  and a small brick called the  Flanders  tile which probably has been often mistaken for  Roman  This gate was of great strength and what was peculiar to it had a deep well within  IN the  Bastard Falconbridge  at the head of five thousand  riotous people attacked the city on this side won this gate and forced a way in for a few of his forces but the portcullis being let down they were all slain The valiant alderman of the ward and the recorder ordered it to be drawn up and sallying forth defeated the Bastard with great slaughter In this gate was taken down and rebuilt under the care of  Martin Bond  aforementioned as a proof of its antiquity many  Roman  coins were found among the foundations  IMMEDIATELY without the gate is the church of  St Botolph  's  ST BOTOLPH'S ALDGATE  Aldgate  This is one of four dedicated in  London  to this favorite saint In it is the vault of the  Darcies  of the north and the tomb of  Thomas  lord  Darcie  knight of the Garter with his figure on it representing him asleep with a shroud wrapped round him his face breast and arms naked The figure is at present deformed by fresh painting and the inscription rendered illegible This nobleman disliking the innovations in religious matters took a secret part in the insurrection called the  Pilgrimage of grace  and in conjunction with the archbishop of  York  was supposed to have given up to  Aske  chief of the malecontents the castle of  Pontefract  on very frivolous pretences He lost his head on  Towerhill  in and was interred in this church He had been in high favor with the king was entrusted by him in with fifteen hundred archers and four great ships to assist  Ferdinand  against the  Moors  of  Africa  but that monarch having brought his designs to succeed to his wish dismissed lord  Darcie  and his forces with rich rewards  Lord  Herbert  's life of  Henry  VIII p    HERE also was buried another victim to the unrelenting  Henry  Sir  Nichol's Carew  his master of the horse and knight of the Garter This gentleman was charged with nothing more than of being of council with  Henry Courtney  marquis of  Exeter  for the imaginary plot of deposing his master and making cardinal  Pole  king in his stead for this on  March  d he suffered on  Towerhill  By the instructions of his keeper he imbibed the principles of the reformers and died professing their religion  HOUSE OF JOHN STOW  NEAR  Aldgate  lived and died the able historian  John Stow  He relates a cruel execution on a gibbet erected on the pavement before his house on the bailiff of  Rumford  in the time of  Edward  VI In that age there were most barbarous and tyrannous punishments by martial law against all spreaders of rumors The times were turbulent but slighter penalties than death might have sufficed The unhappy man on the ladder declared in the presence of our historian  That he knew not for what offence he was brought to die "except for words by me spoken yesternight to Sir  Stephen  curate and preacher of this parish which were these He asked me What news in the countrey I answered Heavy newes Why quoth he It is sayd quoth I that many men bee up in  Essex  but thanks be to God all is in good quiet about us And this was all as God be my judge" Upon these words of the prisoner Sir  Stephen  to avoide the reproach of the people left the citie and never was heard of since among them to my knowledge  I shall have farther occasion to speak of Sir  Stephen  who was a fanatical firebrand of those days  WHITECHAPEL  ON the outside of the gate begins the long street and suburbs of  Whitechapel  The church stands very distant from the entrance into the street It was originally a chapel of ease to  Stepney  and  known as early as the year by the name of the church of  St Mary Matfelon  which is said to signify in the  Hebrew Mary lately delivered of her holy child  as the township was styled  Villa Beatae Mariae de Matfelon  Stow  ii book iv p  It is now a very rich rectory in the gift of  Brazennose College Oxford  IN this parish some of our nobility had formerly their villas for the sake of the country air Here  Cromwel  earl of  Essex  the shortlived minister of  Henry  VIII had a house and the famous  Gondamor  retired here when disengaged from his bubble  James  I  PARALLEL to the walls between  Aldgate  and the  Tower  MINORIES  is the street called the  Minories  named from certain poor ladies of the order of  St Clare  or minoresses who had been invited into  England  by  Blanch  queen of  Navarre  wife to  Edmund  earl of  Lancaster  who in founded here for their reception a convent On its suppression it was converted into a dwellinghouse and granted by the king to several great people who inhabited it The bishops of  Bath and Wells  once had it in lieu of their mansion in the  Strand  and in  Henry Grey  duke of  Suffolk  possessed it by patent from  Edward  VI On his attainder it reverted to the crown in which it continued till the Restoration Soon after a new house was built on it called the  King  's for what reason is unknown  Charles  granted it to Colonel  William Legge  who resided there died in it in and was buried from thence with great funeral pomp in the adjoining church that of  Trinity Minories  and his descendants of the  Dartmouth  family still continue to make it the place of their interment  NOW A FINE STREET  THIS street from being as despicable as any in the city has of late years been most excellently rebuilt is filled with several spacious shops is become a fine street and on one side has its square its circus and its crescent  GOODMAN'S FIELDS  BEHIND this street is  Goodman's Fields  or rather square  Stow  in his simple manner tells that in his time one  Trolop  and afterwards  Goodman  were the farmers there and that the  fields were a farme belonging to the said nunrie at the which farme I myselfe says he in my youth have fetched manye a halfe peny worth of milk and never had lesse then ale pints for a halfe penny in the summer nor lesse then one ale quart for a halfe penny in the winter alwaies hot from the kine  His Survaie    THE theatre in  Goodman's Fields  will always be remembered by my cotemporaries as the stage where  Garrick  first shewed those powers which for such a number of years astonished and charmed the public his first appearance was on  October  th One  Odel  founded the playhouse in this square in As Sir  John Hawkins  expresses it a  halo  of brothels  Life of Doctor  Johnson    soon incircled that as it does all theatres and drove away the industrious inhabitants This theatre was rebuilt in an expensive manner by  Henry Giffard  in but was suppressed by the excellent act for the licensing of places of dramatical entertainment Yet it was supported a few years by an evasion during which time Mr  Garrick  entered himself of the company He drew an audience of nobility and gentry whose carriages filled the whole space from  Templebar  to  Whitechapel  Life of  Garrick  i    ON the west side of this portion of the walls  HOUSE OF CROSSED FRIARS  stood the house of the  Crutched  or  Crossed Friars  or  Fratres sanctae Crucis  The order was instituted or at lest reformed about the year by  Gerard  prior of  St Mary de Morello  at  Bologna  They astonished the  English  by appearing among them in and requiring from the opulent a house to live in telling them they were privileged by the pope to be exempt from being reproached by any body and that they had from him power to excommunicate those who were hardy enough to reprove them Two citizens  Ralph Hosier  and  William Sabernes  were wise enough to accommodate them with a house in this place and became friars in it Originally they carried in their hands an iron cross which they afterwards changed into one of silver They wore a cross made of red cloth on their garment which at first was grey and in later times altered to blue One  Adams  was the first prior  Edmund Streatham  the last Their annual income was only £  s    d Henry  VIII granted their house to Sir  Thomas Wyat  GRANTED TO SIR THOMAS WYAT  the elder who built a handsome mansion on part of the site This was the gentleman whom  Anthony Wood  Athenae Ox  i  not without justice calls the delight of the muses and of mankind He had the honor to be in great intimacy with the congenial peer  Henry  earl of  Surry  They were the refiners of our poetry the elegant effusions of their muses are united in a little book published in intitled  Songes and Sonnets by the right honorable  Henry Howard  late earl of  Surry  and others  Sir  Thomas  died in of a violent fever in  Dorsetshire  contracted by hard riding to conduct to court the emperor's ambassador who had landed at  Falmouth  He was highly celebrated by his noble friend and by every person of genius in the age in which he lived  LUMLEYHOUSE  THIS house afterwards became the residence of  John  lord  Lumley  a celebrated warrior in the time of  Henry  VIII who distinguished himself greatly at the battle of  Floddon  by his valour and the number of men he brought into the field Notwithstanding this his zeal for the old religion engaged him in the  Pilgrimage of Grace  from which he with much dexterity extricated himself and followers But his only son soon after lost his head for his concern in a fresh insurrection  John  lord  Lumley  grandson of the first was among the few nobility of that time who had a taste for literature He had the good fortune to marry his sister  Barbara  to my illustrious countryman  Humphrey Llwyd  of  Denbigh  Tour in Wales  vol ii  and by his assistance formed a considerable library which at present makes a most valuable part in the  British Museum  THE NAVY OFFICE  IN the place of this rose the Navy Office a building of no beauty in which the comptroller of the navy used to reside and all business respecting the payment of seamen's wages and many other naval matters were transacted but this office is now removed to  Somersethouse  In the place of the Old Navy Office the  India  company have erected a most magnificent warehouse a regular oblong square of about two hundred and fifty feet by a hundred and sixty inclosing a court of a hundred and fifty by sixty entered by an arched gateway This is the great repository of the teas I am told that the searchers who have frequent occasions to thrust their arms deep into the chests often feel numbnesses and paralytic affections  THE friars hall was converted into a glasshouse  A GLASSHOUSE  for the making of drinking glasses which with forty thousand billets of wood was destroyed by fire in  Stow's Survaie    The manufacture was set up in and was the first of the kind known in  England  I may add here that the finest flint glass was first made at the  Savoy  and the first glass plates for lookingglasses and coach windows in at  Lambeth  under the patronage of  George Villiers  duke of  Buckingham  I FIND among the list of persons interred in the church belonging to these friars the name of Sir  Rhys Gryffydd  a  Welshman  who lost his head on  Towerhill  in His servant  John Hughes  was hanged at  Tyburn  the same afternoon  Holinshed  I cannot learn what their crime was in a reign when very trifling matters and often bare suspicion brought on a capital penalty  NEAR this place stood another  Northumberlandhouse  inhabited  NORTHUMBERLANDHOUSE  in the reign of  Henry  VI by two of the earls of  Northumberland  one lost his life in the battle of  St Albans  the other his son in that of  Towton  Being deserted by the  Percies  the gardens were converted into bowlingallies and other parts says  Stow  into dicinghouses This I imagine was the first of those pernicious places of resort for he calls it  their antient and only patron of misrule  IN  Marklane  near this place stood the magnificent house  Strype  i book ii  built by Sir  William Sharrington  a chief officer of the mint  SHARRINGTONHOUSE  in the reign of  Edward  VI He was the instrument of the ambition  of  Thomas Seymour  lord admiral he fell with his master was condemned and attained and  Sharringtonhouse  bestowed on the earl of  Arundel  being thought a fit habitation for that great peer on account of its size and splendor Let me add that Sir  William  was pardoned emerged from his misfortunes and soon raised another considerable estate under the favor of  Seymour  's rival  Dudley  duke of  Northumberland  Carte  i  possibly at the price of the admiral's blood against whom he was chief evidence Mr WALPOLE has a drawing of Sir  William  after  Holbein  ALL HALLOWS BARKING  AT the bottom of this lane in  Towerstreet  stands the church of  All Hallows Barking Legend  says that  Edward  I when prince of  Wales  was admonished by a vision to erect an image here to the glorious virgin and in case he visited it five times in the year he was to be victorious over all nations and in particular over  Scotland  and  Wales  The image grew into great repute and vast were the pilgrimages to it till the suppression An indulgence of forty days was granted to every one who performed this act of devotion  Newcourt  i    PERSONS BEHEADED BURIED THERE  IN this church were deposited for a time the bodies of that accomplished nobleman  Henry Howard  Collins  i  Stow's Survaie    earl of  Surry  and two prelates who ended their days by the ax on  Towerhill  The ashes of the illfated  Surry  were in removed to  Framlingham  in  Suffolk  The pious  Fisher  whose head was placed on a pole on the bridge and the indiscreet  Laud  The first was removed to the chapel in the  Tower  to rest by the side of his friend  Sir  Thomas More  Weever    The remains of  Laud  beheaded in lay here till when they were removed to  St John's College Oxford  over which he had presided  Newcourt      IN this parish was designed a hospital for poor priests and for lunatics of both sexes as early as the time of  Edward  III but not taking effect it was granted to the hospital of  St Katherine  which was to find a chaplain to pray for the soul of  Robert Denton  who had piously intended the first foundation  The same    FROM  Aldgate  the walls ran southward to the  Thames  and ended as is generally supposed with a fort on the site of which arose the present TOWER of  London  To the north of it was a postern for the benefit of foot passengers it was originally a fair and strong gate built of stone brought out of  Kent  POSTERN GATE  and  Caen  in  Normandy  It stood till the year when it fell down not as is conjectured from the pulling down of three hundred feet of the adjacent wall in for the purpose of enlarging and strengthening the Tower but from decay  THE TOWER OF LONDON  it being made at the same time with that fortress which was built by the Conqueror in his first year and strongly garrisoned with  Normans  to secure the allegiance of his new and reluctant subjects  THE first work seems to have been suddenly flung up in on his taking possession of the capital this included in it a part of the antient wall for soon after the murder of Sir  Thomas Overbury  a dispute arose whether he was poisoned in the liberties of the city or in the county of  Middlesex  on examination part of the antient wall was discovered and his apartment found to be  to the west of it and in consequence the criminals were tried within the jurisdiction of the city Had it been on the other side it would have been adjudged to have been within the county There is another proof of this fortress having been built upon the remains of another more antient for in in digging on the south side of what is called  Cesar  's chapel were discovered some old foundations of stone three yards broad so strongly cemented that it was with the utmost difficulty they were forced up  WHITE TOWER  THE great square tower called the  White Tower  and by the  Welsh Twr Gwyn  or  Twr y Bryngwyn  was erected in the year when it arose under the directions of the great military architect  Gundulph  bishop of  Rochester  Guillelm Pictav  inter  Script Normann  p  who gave this noble specimen of innovation in the art of castlebuilding and which was pursued by him in the execution of  Rochestercastle  on the banks of the  Medway Stow  tells us from  Edmund de Haddenham  that during the time  Gundulph  was employed in this work he was lodged in the house of one  Edmere  a citizen of  London  Survai      This building was long dignified with the name of  Cesar  's tower but that illustrious invader probably never saw  London  originally it stood by itself  Fitzstephen  gives it the name of  Arx Palatina  the  Palatine  tower and says with his usual romance that the mortar of the foundation was tempered with the blood of beasts The commander had the title of  Palatine  bestowed on him being as was the case with several of the great men of that time who had places of importance trusted to their care endowed with  regal powers such for example as the earl palatine  Hugh Lupus  had in the county palatinate of  Chester  Lord  Lyttelton's Henry  II iii    WITHIN this tower is a very antient chapel for the use of such of our kings and queens who wished to pay their devotion here By  Stow  's description for I never saw it it seems coeval with the building he described it as having a long flight of steps to it as being darksome and venerable for the pillars which are very plain but that it was in his time filled with our valuable old records  Strype's Stow  i book i p    IN a violent tempest did great injury to the  Tower  but it was repaired by  William Rufus  and his successor The first added another castellated building on the south side between it and the  Thames  which was afterwards called  St Thomas's Tower  Beneath that was  Traitorsgate  through which state prisoners were brought from the river and under another properly enough called  The Bloody  for till these happier ages there was little difference between confinement and the scaffold or private assassination  Ye towers of  Julius London  's lasting shame  With many a foul and midnight murder fed  HERE fell the meek usurper  Henry  VI by the dagger of the profligate  Gloucester  Here full of horrors died  MURDERS WITHIN THE TOWER  by the hands of hired ruffians the unsteady  Clarence  Here the sweet innocents  Edward  V and his brother duke of  York  perished victims to the ambition of their remorseless uncle And the empoisoning of Sir  Thomas Overbury  makes up the sum of the known murders the reproaches of our antient fortress We have here a strait room or dungeon called from the misery the unhappy occupier of this very confined place endures the  Little Ease  But this will appear a luxurious habitation when compared with the inventions of the age of  Louis  XI of  France  with his iron cages in which persons of rank lay for whole years or his  Oubliettes  dungeons made in form of reversed cones concealed with trapdoors down which dropped the unhappy victims of the tyrant brought there by  Tristan l'Hermite  his companion and executioner in ordinary Sometimes their sides were plain sometimes set with knives or sharpedged wheels but in either case they were true  Oubliettes  the devoted were certain to fall into the land where all things were forgotten  THE  Tower  was first inclosed by  William Longchamp  bishop of  Ely  and chancellor of  England  in the reign of  Richard  I This haughty prelate having a quarrel with  John  third brother to  Richard  under pretence of guarding against his designs surrounded the whole with walls embattled and made on the outside a vast ditch  DITCH  into which in after times the water from the  Thames  was introduced Different princes added other works The present contents within the walls are twelve acres and five rods the circuit on the outside of the ditch one thousand and fiftytwo feet It was again inclosed with a mudwall by  Henry  III this was placed at a distance from the ditch and occasioned the taking down of part of the city wall which was resented by the citizens who pulling down this precinct of mud were punished by the king with a fine of a thousand marks  LIONS TOWER  EDWARD IV built the Lions tower it was originally called the  Bulwark but received the former name from its use  ROYAL MENAGERY  A menagery had very long been a piece of regal state  Henry  I had his at his manor of  Woodstock  where he kept lions leopards lynxes porcupines and several other uncommon beasts They were afterwards removed to the  Tower Edward  II commanded the sheriffs of  London  to pay the keepers of the king's leopards six pence a day for the sustenance of the leopards and three halfpence a day for the diet of the keeper out of the feefarm of the city I should have mentioned before that  Henry  issued his order to the sheriffs to supply four pence a day for the maintenance of his white bear  urso nostro albo  and his keeper in the  Tower  of  London  They were also to provide a muzzle and an iron chain to hold the said bear out of the water and a long cord to hold it during the time it was fishing in the  Thames  they were besides ordered to build a small house in the  Tower  for the king's elephant  elefantem nostrum  and to make provision both for beast and keeper  Madox  Antiq Excheq i    THE royal menagery is to this day exceedingly well supplied In  April  there was a leopard of a quite unknown species brought from  Bengal  It was wholly black but the hair was marked on the back sides and neck with round clusters of small spots of a glossy and the most intense black the tail hung several inches beyond the length of the legs and was very full of hair Here were also two tigers one had been here some time and its groundcolor had faded into a pale sickly sandiness the other young and vigorous and almost fresh from its native woods was  almost of an orange color and its black stripes and the white parts were most pure in their kinds  Engraved and described by  M de la Metherie  dans le Journal de Physique  J  llet  p tab ii    THE little book sold in the  Tower  will give a very satisfactory account of all its curiosities natural and artificial To that I refer my reader  TOWERHILL  FOR a considerable time there was a dispute between the crown and the city about the right to the  Towerhill  the  Gwynfryn  of the  Welsh  In the reign of  Edward  IV the king's officers erected there a gallows and a scaffold for the execution of offenders The citizens complained and  Edward  immediately disavowed the act by public proclamation From that time the fatal apparatus is always provided by the city The condemned are delivered to the sheriffs by the lieutenant who receives from the former a receipt for their delivery the sheriffs then see execution done as in other places  THE FIRST PERSON BEHEADED ON TOWERHILL  THE first whom I recollect to have suffered here by the more honorable death of the ax was in when Sir  Simon de Burley  knight of the Garter tutor of  Richard  II and the most accomplished man of his time fell a victim to the malice of the potent faction which had usurped the regal authority Queen  Anne  the good queen  Anne  went on her knees to the luke of  Glocester  the king's uncle to implore mercy and continued in that attitude three hours before the inexorable tyrant  THE FORMER ROUGH TREATMENT OF PRISONERS  THERE was during a very long period a barbarous meanness a species of insult to the unhappy criminals which is in our days happily changed into every species of tenderness and humanity  consistent with public justice and security In revenge for the death of Sir  Simon  and many others who suffered in the same cause the great earl of  Arundel Richard Fitzalan  was hurried instantly from the place of trial the palace at  Westminster  to  Towerhill  his arms and his hands were bound and the king glutted his eyes with the bloody scene That great peer  Thomas  duke of  Norfolk  who was confined here in the last year of  Henry  VIII was reduced to beg for sheets He was to have lost his head but was saved by the death of the tyrant on the very day ordered for his execution He was kept in custody during the next short reign but was released on the accession of queen  Mary  He mounted his horse at the edge of fourscore to assist in quelling the insurrection of Sir  Thomas Wyat  in This served to fill the  Tower  with new subjects for the mean insults of the times Sir  Thomas  and the rest of the prisoners were brought into the  Tower  through the  Traitorsgate  The lieutenant received them one by one with insults and gross abuse When Sir  Thomas  appeared gallantly dressed the lieutenant actually collared him Sir  Thomas  gave him a fierce and reproachful look bravely telling him  This is no masterie now  ONE person of rank suffered here by the more infamous way of the halter I should not mention Sir  Gervis Elwayes  SIR GERVIS ELWAYES  lieutenant of the  Tower  who suffered here in for his concern in the murder of Sir  Thomas Overbury  but for the great instruction which may be gathered from his end and his excellent dying speech For there is something very peculiar in his admonition to the spectators against appealing to Heaven by a rash vow for having been greatly addicted to gaming he had said seriously in his  prayers  Lord let me be hanged if ever I play more  and yet he broke it a thousand times  See the whole in the first xiv yeares of king  James  's reign p  Of what utility would be a sensible collection of these proofs of the FINGER OF GOD exemplified to mankind in the detection and punishment of every species of crime  CHAPEL OF THE TO    THE church of  St Petrus ad Vincula  within the  Tower  has been the undistinguishing repository of the headless bodies of numbers who ended their days on the adjacent hill or when greatly favored within the fortress The antient church was much more splendid it being occasionally the place at which the kings of  England  performed their orisons In  Henry  III's time here were stalls for the king and queen a chancel dedicated to  St Peter  and another to  St Mary  The church was adorned with a fine cross images of saints and various paintings  benè b  nis coloribus  Also several holy figures in painted glass all done by that early lover and patron of the arts in  England  the monarch just mentioned  Str  pe's Stow  i book i Mr WALPOLE's Anecdotes i    EXECUTED PERSONS BURIED THERE  TO the present

and the treachery of the attorneygeneral  Rich  who under pretence of consulting him obtained his confidence and betrayed him The pope rewarded his orthodoxy with a cardinal's hat but it did not arrive till the poor bishop's head was on a pole on  Londonbridge  His headless corse was removed to be near that of his friend who suffered about three weeks after in the same cause the  great Sir  Thomas More  SIR THOMAS MORE  But his body did not long keep company with that of his brother sufferer nor his head on the bridge His affectionate daughter  Margaret Roper  procured the one to be removed to  Chelsea  and the head accidentally blown into the  Thames  to be given to her She kept it during life as a relique and directed that after her death it should be lodged in her arms and

conviction of the same crime rest here  George  lord  Rochford  the innocent brother of the former involved in the accusation preceded her to the grave by two days as his infamous wife a cause of their death accompanied unpitied her mistress  Catherine Howard  in execution and in sepulchre It is impossible not to moralize on comparing the manner in which she was brought prisoner to this fatal fortress with the gay and splendid pageantry which attended her and her savage spouse from  Greenwich  by water to the same place on  May  th and from the  Tower  two days after with still greater magnificence to her coronation She rejoiced too publickly on the death of  Catherine  of  Arragon  whose place she most wrongfully usurped in less than five months she herself fell as a criminal  See

EARL O    THE favorite earl of  Essex Robert Devereux  was reluctantly given to the block by his fond mistress after a long struggle between fear and affection Mr  Walpole  observes that it was a fashion to treat the passion of that illustrious princess as a romance She it is alleged was sixtyeight but it was forgotten that the earl was only thirtyfour Let their ages have been reversed you would never have heard of the unhappy love of  Elizabeth  DUKE OF MONMOUTH  BENEATH the communion table reposes the handsome restless ungrateful son of  Charles  II the duke of  Monmouth  His ambition like that of many of those he followed to this place occasioned his death He is said to have died calmly and to have acknowleged the guilt of rebellion but love preserved her influence to the last moment He was married very young and for interested motives He had made a connection of the most tender nature with lady  Harriet Wentworth  who lived with him as his wife He could not with all the arguments of our best divines be convinced of the sin of adultery he called her the choice of  his ripened years I have been told a tradition that lady  Harriet  had placed herself in a window to take a last and farewel look he was master enough of himself to make her a graceful bow With more certainty can I say that the king on the evening of the execution visited the widowed dutchess to give assurance of his attention to her and her children Consolation she did not want for she had been separated from him and when at the duke's earnest request she had an interview with him in the  Tower  their interview was as  Barillon  expresses it  aigre de part et d' autre  Dalrymple  's Memoirs ii    THE repentant earl of  Kilmarnock  and the rough and fearless lord  Balmerino  avowing the

late keeper of his majesty's  regalia  th  September  aged  was deposited here Was it not a shameless reign no remembrance of this good and faithful servant would have been suffered to remain This venerable man was keeper of the  regalia  when the russian  Blood  made the notorious attempt on the crown and other ornaments of majesty Never was a more determined villain  with a head to contrive and heart to execute any wickedness  Blood  contrived under the guise of a clergyman to make acquaintance with Mr  Edwards  insinuated himself into his favor and confidence After various visits with the assistance of several other associates he seized on the old man whom he had requested to shew the jewels to his friends gagged him and on his resisting struck him on the head with a mallet and gave him several stabs  Edwards  thought it prudent to counterfeit death  Blood  put the crown under his parson's gown another put the globe in his breeches a third not being able to conceal the sceptre by reason of its length broke off the rich ruby and put it in his pocket As soon as they were gone  Edwards  forced out the gag and gave the alarm they were instantly pursued and three of them  soon taken  Blood  struggled hard for his prize saying when it was wrested from him  It was a gallant attempt though unsuccessful it was for a  CROWN  THE curiosity of the king was excited to see a man engaged in so many important villanies under pretence of obtaining discoveries his majesty made the wretch a visit from that moment the artful  Blood  dated his security he told the king so many plausible tales such indifference he shewed for his own life such anxiety for that of his majesty for he insinuated that his comrades would certainly revenge his death even on his sacred majesty that in a short time he obtained his pardon It was necessary to apply to the duke of  Ormond  for permission the ruffian having made the attempt on his grace's life not long before The duke nobly answered  If his majesty could forgive him stealing the crown he might easily forgive the attempt upon his life and if such was his majesty's pleasure that was a sufficient reason for him and his lordship the earl of  Arlington  who brought the message might spare the rest  Blood  was not only pardoned but received into favor had a pension of five hundred a year and was perpetually seen at court enjoying the smiles of majesty and even successfully employing his interest as a most respectable patron But all good men looked on him with horror and considered him as a  Sicarius  to a profligate set of men to overawe any who had integrity enough to resist the measures of a most profligate court This miscreant died peacefully in his bed  August  th fearlessly and without any signs of penitence totally hardened and forsaken by Heaven  THE innocent  Talbot Edwards  so far from receiving the grateful reward of his fidelity and sufferings got with great difficulty  a pension of two hundred a year and his son who was active in taking  Blood  one hundred more but the order for the pensions was so long delayed and the expences attending the cure of the good old man's wounds so great that he was forced to sell his order for a hundred pounds ready money and the son his for fifty It is singular that this aged man survived his injuries seven years the attempt was made  May  th and the

ARCHBISHOP SUDBURY  That worthy primate  Sudbury  archbishop of  Canterbury  Sir  Robert Hales  treasurer of  England  and many others took refuge with their youthful king in the  Tower  It was then garrisoned with six hundred armed men and six hundred archers who appalled at the mob stood motionless The rebels seized on the primate Sir  Robert John Legge  serjeant at arms and  William Appledore  the king's confessor all of whom they instantly beheaded on  Towerhill  the archbishop with peculiar circumstances of cruelty being almost hewn to pieces by their cruel rage  JAMES LORD SAY AND HIS SONINLAW  IN the mob under  Jack Cade  in an endarkened and savage period forced out of this fortress  James  lord  Say  whom the king had committed to appease the furious commons They brought him to  Guildhall  and from thence hurried him to the  Standard  in  Cheapside  where they struck off his head tied his naked body to a horse's tail dragged it to  Southwark  and there  cut it into quarters

salute his unhappy soninlaw on his way to execution nor was any insult to their mangled trunks omitted by the furious  canaille  But the acts of a mob ought never to tarnish a national character  WITHIN the  Tower  on the green before the chapel  LORD HASTINGS  was beheaded the accomplished lord  Hastings  His fidelity to the children of his late master  Edward  IV was the cause of his death He was dragged from the counciltable by order of their ambitious  protector Glocester  who swore he would have his head before he dined and such was his haste that the unfortunate lord had only time to make a short shrift to a priest who casually passed by and his head was taken off on a log which happened to lie in the way So little did he expect death that scarcely an hour before he was exulting in the fate of his enemies lord  Rivers  lord  Richard Grey  and Sir  Thomas Vaughan  at  Pontefract  yet all four underwent the stroke of the headsman on the very same day Besides these I can make a miscellaneous recital of several who died within these walls by natural deaths by suicide or by accident  ELIZABETH  ELIZABETH WIFE OF HENRY VII  wife of  Henry  VII breathed her last here in childbed in  HENRY EIGHTH EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND  HERE may be truly said to have fled indignant to the shades the high spirit of  Henry  earl of  Northumberland  He was confined for the same cause

suffered to languish till his death in his bones were kept in an iron chest A late great dutchess of the same family procured his scull had it enchased in gold and kept it to exalt her devotion as the relique of a martyr to religion  ARTHUR EARL OF ESSEX  ARTHUR earl of  Essex  accomplice with lord  Russel  ended here his days Despair seized him on his confinement and forsaken by Heaven he put an end to his existence by the razor He was of a party charged with equal freedom in religious as political principles He vindicated and practised suicide His death was charged on the court but without the lest grounds The prince who could bring lord  Russel  to the block by a legal course need never have incurred the odium of assassination on a less important partner of the conspiracy  SIR JOHN PERROT  HERE died in  September  Sir  John Perrot  the supposed son of  Henry  VIII by  Mary  wife to  Thomas Perrot  esq  of  Haroldstone  in the county of  Pembroke  In his great stature and high spirit he bore a strong resemblance to that monarch Young  Perrot  first attracted his notice by a quarrel he had with two of the yeoman of the guard whom he foiled in a quarrel he had at the  stews  in  Southwark  He was in high favor in the following  reign In that of  Mary  fell into disgrace on account of his attachment to the reformed religion When queen  Elizabeth  succeeded he experienced the smiles of his sovereign and sister At length was constituted lord deputy of  Ireland  where he grew very unpopular by reason of his haughty conduct was recalled unjustly accused and condemned of treason His sentence was respited but he died of a broken heart unable from his lofty spirit to brook the illtreatment he met with from one he thought so near an ally  IN this prison also sunk a victim to unmerited misfortunes  LADY ARABELLA STUART  the innocent  Arabella Stuart  daughter of  Charles Stuart  earl of  Lenox  and younger brother to lord  Darnley  father to  James  I Her affinity to the crown brought her under the jealousy of both  Elizabeth  and that monarch The conspiracy in for which lord  Cobham  Sir  Walter Raleigh  and others were condemned was supposed among other objects to have that of placing the crown on the head of this unfortunate lady on which she was confined to her own house She found means to be married privately to Sir  William Seymour  second son of the earl of  Hertford  afterwards restored to the dukedom of  Somerset  On discovery of the wedding they were committed to the  Tower  to the care of different keepers They artfully contrived

their durance The first is  Henry  earl of  Northumberland  imprisoned on the very just suspicion of being privy to the Gunpowder treason During the time he was in custody he amused himself most rationally in the company of learned men who were permitted to have access to him Among others were three who were called his  Wizards  possibly he might be fond of astronomy or dabble in judicial astrology circumstances that with the vulgar might easily fasten on him the imputation of dealing with the devil  EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON AND HIS CAT  A VERY remarkable accident befel  Henry Wriothsly  earl of  Southampton  the friend and companion of the earl of  Essex  in his fatal insurrection after he had been confined there a small time he was surprized by a visit from his favorite cat which had found its way to the  Tower  and as tradition says reached its master by descending the chimney of his apartment I have seen at  Bulstrode  the summer residence of the late dutchess of  Portland  an original portrait of this earl in the place of his confinement in a black dress and cloak with the faithful animal sitting by him  In the same collection is another portrait of the same nobleman out of confinement richly dressed with a rich helmet and armour lying by him  Perhaps this picture might have been the foundation of the tale  LORD CHANCELLOR JEFFRIES  THE fallen lord chancellor the cruel instrument of despotism under  James  II died imprisoned here of a broken heart aided by intemperance He was first interred in the church belonging to the  Tower  and afterwards was removed to that of  St Mary Aldermanbury  and deposited near the body of his rakish son lord  Wem  In my younger days I have heard of a hardhearted insult on this once great man during his imprisonment He received as he thought a present of  Colchester  oysters and expressed great satisfaction at the thought of having some friend yet left but on taking off the top of the barrel instead of the usual contents appeared an halter  To conclude this melancholy list I shall return to antient times  GRYFFYDD FATHER OF OUR LAST PRINCE LLEWELYN  to lament the sad fate of my countrymen victims to  English

St Catherine  's originally founded in by  Matilda  of  Boulogne  wife of king  Stephen  for the repose of her son  Baldwin  and her daughter  Matilda  and for the maintenance of a master brothers and sisters and other poor persons In  Elinor  widow of  Henry  possessed herself of it dissolved the old foundation refounded it in honor of the same saint for a master three brethren chaplains three sisters ten  Bedes  women and six poor scholars Queen  Philippa  wife of  Edward  III was a great benefactress to this hospital and to this day it remains under queenly patronage according to the reservation made by the pious refoundress  Elinor  Our present gracious queen is the twentyninth royal patroness  THE mastership is a sinecure of considerable value In this hospital is a house for him and all its members The reader will find the disposition of them in the plan printed by Mr  Nichols  in the account of  St Katherine  's hospital and its collegiate church a posthumous work of that able antiquary the late  Andrew Coltee Ducarel  LL D He was interred in the collegiate church where a plain piece of marble informs us of little more than the period of his existence  CHURCH  THE church is a handsome  gothic  building but almost quite lost in the various houses which shut it up from public view The east window is very elegant and in the modern improvements there is the utmost propriety preserved in the imitation of the antient architecture The wooden pulpit is a curiosity on its eight sides are represented the antient building and different gates of the hospital beneath each compartment extend EZRA THE SCRIBESTOOD UPON APULPIT OF WOOD WHICH HE HADMADE FOR THEPREACHIN  Neh e  chap viii  UNDER one of the stalls is a very good carving of the head of  queen  Philippa

duke of  Exeter  who lies recumbent with a fillet round his head and in a long gown the weeds of peace By him are placed the figure of his first wife  Anne  daughter of  Edmund  earl  Stafford  and widow of  Edmund Mortimer  earl of  March  and another of his sister  Constance  first wife to  Thomas Mowbray  duke of  Norfolk  and afterwards to Sir  John Grey  eldest son of  Reginald  lord  Grey  of  Ruthen  This potent peer was a great benefactor to the hospital founded in it a chauntry and bequeathed to the high altar in the church  a cuppe of byroll garnished with gold perles and precious stones to be put in the sacrament  and numbers of other valuable effects He died in peace in a wonderful thing in his family not fewer than four of this great house in little more than a century fell by violent deaths  BELOW  St Catherine's  on the river side  THE BEREHOUSE  stood the great breweries or  Berehouse  as it is called in the map published in the first volume of the  Civitates Orbis  They were subject to regulations as early as the reign of  Henry  VII who in licenses  John Merchant  a  Fleming  to export fifty tons of ale called  Berre  Rymer  xii  And in the same reign one  Geffry Gate  probably an officer of the king's spoiled the brewhouses at  St Catherine  's twice either for sending too much abroad unlicensed or for brewing it too weak for their home customers  Maitland  ii  The demand for this article from foreign parts encreased to a high degree in  the reign of queen  Elizabeth  five hundred tons were exported at once as is expressed for the queen's use at one time probably for the service of her army in the low countries three hundred and fifty barrels to  Embden  three hundred to  Amsterdam  and again eight hundred to  Embden  At this time there seems to have been a free exportation except when checked by proclamation for fear of enhancing the price of corn by excess of brewing in scarce times but even then it was permitted by the royal licence  S  ype's Stow  ii    THOSE who wish to attempt to restore the spirit of the boisterous reign of  Henry  as far as depended on the boasted  British  liquor may use the following receipt  C

London  as it was in the age of queen  Elizabeth  A small village or two might be found in the remaining part of the county of  Middlesex  but bordered by marshes which frequently experienced the ravages of the river  ST  EY  This tract had been a manor in the  Saxon  times called  Stibbenhedde  i e  Stibbenheath  In later days it belonged to  John de Pulteney  who had been four times lord mayor viz in and The bishops of  London  had here a palace as appears from antient records  Given from our palace of  Stebonbyth  or  Stebonheath  which is supposed to have filled the space now covered with several tenements  Newcourt  i  It appears that the side next to the  Thames  had been embanked to resist the fury of the floods From the th of  Edward  I several inquisitions were made to examine the state of the banks and ditches and the tenants who were found negligent were presented as delinquents  Dugdale  on embanking  The church which stands far from the river was originally called  Ecclesia omnium Sanctorum  but was afterwards styled that of  St Dunstan  for the whole body of saints was obliged to give way to him who had the courage to take the devil himself by the nose  Lives of the Saints  The church is by no means distinguished by its architecture In it were interred the remains of the illustrious Sir  Thomas Spert  comptroller of the navy in the time of  Henry  VIII and to whom this kingdom was indebted for that salutary foundation the TRINITYHOUSE  He died  September  th  Here also may be found that curious epitaph mentioned by the  Spectator  Here  Thomas Saffin  lyes interr'd Ah why  Born in  New England  did in  London  dye c  This vast parish is at present divided into eight others yet the mother parish still remains of great extent  THE dock and ship yard the property of Mr  Perry  the greatest private dock in all  Europe  is at the extremity of this parish at  Blackwall  the upper part of the eastern side of the  Isle of Dogs  It may be called the eastern end of  London  being nearly a continued succession of six miles and a half of streets from hence to  Tyburn  turnpike  THE great extent of  Wapping  WAPPING  which stretches along the river side from  St Katherine  's arose from the opinion of the commissioners of sewers in that nothing could secure the manor from the depredations of the water more effectually than the building of houses for they thought the tenants would not fail being attentive to the safety of their lives and property The plan succeeded and in our days we see a vast and populous town added to the antient precincts which had stagnated for ages A long narrow street well paved and handsomely flagged on both sides winding along the banks of the  Thames  as far as the end of  Limehouse  an extent of near two miles and inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men alternate occupants of sea and land their floating tenements lie before them In fact the whole river from the bridge for a vast way is covered with a double forest of masts with a narrow avenue in midchannel These give importance and safety to the state and supply the mutual wants of the universe We send the necessaries and luxuries of our island to every part and in return receive every  pabulum  which should  satiate the most luxurious wealth that ought to make avarice cry Hold enough and matters for speculation for the laudable and delicate longings of the intellectual world  SHADWELL  THE hamlet of  Shadwell  is a continuation of the buildings along the river Between the houses and the water in all this long tract of street are frequent docks and small building yards The passenger is often surprized with the sight of the prow of a ship rising over the street and the hulls of new ones appearing at numbers of openings But all that filth and stench which  Stow  complains of exists no longer  Execution Dock  stills remains at  Wapping  and is in use as often as a melancholy occasion requires The criminals are to this day executed on a temporary gallows placed at lowwater mark but the custom of leaving the body to be overflowed by three tides has long since been omitted  RADCLIFF  THE village of  Radcliff  to which  Wapping  now joins is of some antiquity From hence the gallant Sir  Hugh Willoughby  on  May  the th took his departure on his fatal voyage for discovering the northeast passage to  China  He sailed with great pomp by  Greenwich  where the court then lay Mutual honors were payed on both sides The council and courtiers appeared at the windows and the people covered the shores The young king alone lost the noble and novel sight for he then lay on his deathbed so that the principal object of the parade was disappointed  Hackluyt  i    LIMEHOUSE  LIMEHOUSE is a continuation of the town along the riverside it is a new creation and its church one of the fifty new churches was finished in This may be called the end of  London  on the  waterside but it is continued by means of  Poplar  a chapelry in the parish of  Stepney  antiently a regal manor so named from its abundance of poplar trees across the upper part of the  Isle of Dogs  in a strait line to the river  Lea  the division of this county from  Essex  WAPPING  Shadwell  and  Limehouse  have their respective churches and  Poplar  its chapel The two first have nothing to attract the eye  Limehouse  has its aukward tower a dull square rising out of another embellished with pilasters heavy pinnacles rise out of the uppermost the whole proves how unhappily Mr  Hawksmoor  the architect of  Bloomsbury  church exerted his genius in the obsolete art of steeplebuilding The church in question is one of the new fifty In the year it was added to the bills of mortality  IN our walk through  Limehouse  we crossed the New Cut or  Poplar  canal near its discharge into the river This was begun about twenty years ago runs by  Bromley  and joins the river  Lea  near  Bow  where barges enter by means of a lock called  Bowlock  This canal is about a mile and a quarter in length and serves to bring to our capital corn malt and flour from the neighborhood of  Hertford  and several other counties which put their productions on board the barges at that town It is also of great use to convey to the  Thames  the produce of the great distilleries near  Bow  and also to the internal counties coals and several articles from the metropolis This canal saves the great circuit of passing down to  Leamouth  and thence round the  Isle of Dogs  a navigation often impeded by contrary winds and tides which frequently fall out so adverse as to occasion great delays Yet this canal by no means annihilates the use of the river  Lea  to and from its mouth but barges go indifferently either way as conveniency or the circumstances abovementioned occur Besides many barges will enter the river  Lea  to save the navigation expences of the New Cut  LIMEHOUSE dock is a little farther to the southeast and is much used  WE finished our walk and dined at a small house called the  Folly  on the water's edge almost opposite to the splendid hospital at  Greenwich  where we sat for some hours enjoying the delicious view of the river and the moving picture of a succession of shipping perpetually passing and repassing  BILLS OF MORTALITY  IT is wonderful that in this great city there should have been no regular  Census  but that we must depend on the account of the number of inhabitants from the uncertain calculation of the bills of mortality I will allow them to be delivered annually by the only censors we have  the company of parishclerks  with all possible accuracy as far as their knowlege extends but as it is admitted that a number of people find their burials in coemeteries without the bills equal nearly to those which are annually reported to be interred within their jurisdiction the uncertainty of the enumeration collected from them must be allowed In the last year were buried within the bills if the above assertion  Mr  Richardson  is well founded the sum must be I refer the decision of the numbers of inhabitants to the skilful in calculation I have heard it averred that the present number is a million  Maitland  gives the total in the time of his publication to have  been  Maitland  ii This book is dedicated to  Slingsby Bethel  esq  who was lord mayor in that year  The increase of  London  since his days gives a probability that the enumeration is not much exaggerated  BILLS of mortality took rise in in which began a great pestilence which continued till the th of  December  During this period they were kept in order to ascertain the number of persons who died but when the plague ceased the bills were discontinued They were resumed again in At the original institution there were only a hundred and nine parishes others were gradually added and by the year the number was a hundred and thirtytwo since that time fourteen more have been added so that the whole amounts to a hundred and fortysix viz  within the walls  without the walls  outparishes in  Middlesex  and  Surry  in the city and liberties of  Westminster  To satisfy the curiosity of those who have not opportunity of seeing a  Bill of Mortality  I have printed that of at the end of this book    AMONG the multitudes who fall victims to disease is a melancholy account of the rural youth which crowd here in numbers laboring under the delusion of preferment some perish soon without even attaining a service and urged by want fall under the cognizance of justice Others get admission into shops or into places where they experience hard work hard wages hard lodgings and scanty food They soon fall ill are neglected or flung into an hospital when passed all relief where they perish Their native villages want their innocent labor and the whole  rustic community I may say the whole kingdom suffers for the indiscrcet ambition of these unhappy youths or of their simple parents  RADCLIFF HIGHWAY  WE varied our road on our return by taking that of  Radcliff Highway  a broad and very long street ending in  East Smithfield  On the north side stands another of the new fifty churches  St George  's  Middlesex  square rises out of square to compose the steeple its upper story is incomprehensible the outside stuck around with chimneylike columns square at the lower parts above making a sudden transition into the round This church was began in finished in and by the eccentricity of the style may fairly be suspected to have had Mr  Hawksmoor  for its builder  RAGFAIR  AT the end of this street we found ourselves in the midst of  Ragfair  in the fullest hour of business The articles of commerce by no means belye the name There is no expressing the poverty of the goods nor yet their cheapness A distinguished merchant engaged with a purchaser observing me to look on him with great attention called out to me as his customer was going off with his bargain to observe that man  For  says he  I have actually cloathed him for fourteen pence  ABBY OF ST MARY OF THE GRACES  A LITTLE farther on to the east stood the abby of  St Mary of the Graces  called also the  New Abby  and  Eastminster  in opposition to  Westminster  in respect to its situation It was founded by  Edward  III in in the new churchyard of the  Holy Trinity  and filled with  Cistertians  That churchyard was made by  John Corey  clerk on occasion of the dreadful pestilence which raged in that reign so that there was not room in the common churchyards to inter the dead  Edward  was moved to his piety by a  fright he was seized with in a violent storm in his way to  France  when he vowed if he got safe to shore he would found a monastery to the honor of God and the  Lady of Grace  if she would grant him the  grace  of coming safe on shore  Newcourt  i  At the dissolution its revenues according to  Dugdale  amounted to £  s    d  It was granted to Sir  Arthur Darcie  in who pulled it entirely down "In place thereof" says  Stow  VICTUALLING OFFICE  is builded a large storehouse for victual and convenient ovens are builded for baking of bisket to serve hir majesties shippes  The present Victualling Office succeeded the original building and is allotted for the same purpose  FROM hence I passed by the  Tower  to the Customhouse  CUSTOMHOUSE  a little to the west of that fortress On this spot is the busy concourse of all nations who pay their tribute towards the support of  Great Britain  The present building is of brick and stone before which ships of three hundred and fifty tons can lie and discharge their cargo There was one here built as early as the year by  John Churchman  Strype's Stow  ii book iv  one of the sheriffs of  London  but at that period and long after the customs were collected in different parts of the city and in a very irregular manner About the year the loss to the revenue was first discovered and an act passed to compel people to land their goods in such places as were appointed by the commissioners of the revenue and this was the spot fixed on a Customhouse was erected which being destroyed by the great fire was rebuilt by  Charles  II In it underwent the same fate and was restored in its present form  Before the Customhouse was established here the principal place for receiving the duties was at  Billingsgate  CUSTOMS IN  As early as or the reign of  Etheldred  a small vessel was to pay  ad Bilynggesgate  one penny halfpenny as a toll a greater bearing sails one penny a keel or hulk  Ceol vel Hulcus  four pence a ship laden with wood one piece for toll and a boat with fish one halfpenny or a larger one penny  Brompton  x Scriptores i col  We had even now trade with  France  for its wines for mention is made of ships from  Rouen  who came here and landed them and freed them from toll i e payed their duties  IN  What they amounted to I cannot learn But in the half year's customs for foreign merchandize in the city of  London  came only to £  s    d  In

Trinityhouse a society founded in at a period in which the  British  navy began to assume a system The founder was Sir  Thomas Spert  comptroller of the navy and commander of the great ship  Henry Grace de Dieu  It is a corporation consisting of a master four wardens eight assistants and eighteen elder brethren  The whole corporation are usually called  The Thirtyone Brethren  See a full

and in consequence relieve annually many thousands of poor seamen their widows and orphans  THIS house is unworthy of the greatness of its design In the councilroom are some portraits of eminent men The most remarkable is that of Sir  John Leake  with his lank grey locks and a loose night gown with a mien very little indicative of his high courage and active spirit He was the greatest commander of his time and engaged in most actions of note during the reigns of king  William  and queen  Anne  To him was committed the desperate but successful attempt of breaking the boom previous to the relief of  Londonderry  He distinguished himself greatly at the battle of  La Hogue  assisted at the taking of  Gibraltar  and afterwards as commander in chief reduced  Barcelona  took  Carthagena  and brought  Sardinia  and  Minorca  to submit to  Charles  rival to  Philip  for the crown of  Spain  He was made a lord of the admiralty but declined the offer of being head of the commission at the accession of  George  I averse to the new family he retired but with the approving pension of £ a year He lived privately at  Greenwich  where he died in and was buried in a manner suitable to his

Customhouse  the first place of note is  Billingsgate  or  BILLINGSGATE  to adapt the spelling to conjectures of antiquaries  who go beyond the realms of  Chaos  and old night  Belin  'sgate or the gate of  Belinus  king of  Britain  fellowadventurer with  Brennus  king of the  Gauls  at the sacking of  Rome  three hundred and sixty years before the  Christian  aera and the BELI  mawr  who graces the pedigrees of numbers of us antient  Britons  For fear of falling on some inglorious name I submit to the etymology but must confess there does not appear any record of a gate at this place his son  Lud  was more fortunate for  Ludgate  preserves his memory to every citizen who knows the just value of antiquity  Gate  here signifies only a place where there was a concourse of people  Skinner  's Etymology  a common quay or wharf where there is a free going in and out to the same  Edward  I his grant of  Botolph  's quay  This was a small port for the reception of shipping and for a considerable time the most important place for the landing of almost every article of commerce It was not till the reign of king  William  that it became celebrated as a fishmarket who in by act of parlement made it a free port for fish which might be sold there every day in the week except  Sunday  The object of this has long been frustrated and the epicure who goes as was a frequent practice to  Billingsgate  to eat fish in perfection will now be cruelly disappointed  I CANNOT give a list of the fish most acceptable in the  Saxon  ages but there is a list left of those which were brought

may be added the sturgeon and ling and there is twice mention in archbishop  Nevill  's great feast of a certain fish both roasted and baked unknown at present called a  Thirlepoole  THE seal was also reckoned a fish and with the sturgeon and porpess were the only fresh fish which by the d of  Henry  VIII were permitted to be bought of any stranger at sea between  England  and  France Flanders  and  Zealand  LONDONBRIDGE  A LITTLE to the west is  Londonbridge  The year of its foundation is not settled The first mention of it is in the laws of  Ethelred  which fix the tolls of vessels coming to  Billingsgate  or  ad Pontem  It could not be prior to the year when  Unlaf  the  Dane  sailed up the river as high as  Stains  Saxon Chron    without interruption nor yet after the year in which  Ethelred  died and the great  Canute  king of  Denmark  when he besieged  London  was impeded in his operations by a bridge which even at that time must have been strongly fortified to oblige him to have recourse to the following vast expedientHe caused a prodigious ditch to be cut on the south side of the  Thames  at  Rotherhithe  or  Redriff  a little to the east of  Southwark  which he continued at a distance from the south end of the bridge in form of a semicircle opening into the western part of the river Through this he drew his ships and effectually compleated the blockade of the city  The same  But the valour of the citizens obliged him to raise the siege Evidences of this great work were found in the place called  The Dock Head  at  Redriff  where it began Fascines of hazels and other brushwood fastened down with stakes were discovered in digging that dock in and in other parts of its course have been met with in ditching large oaken planks and numbers of piles  Maitland  i    WHEN BUILT  THE bridge originated from the public spirit of the college of priests of  St Mary Overie  Before there had been a ferry left by her parents to their only daughter  Mary  who out of the profits founded a nunnery and endowed it with the profits of the boat This house was afterwards converted into the college of  priests who not only built the bridge but kept it in repair but it must be understood that the first bridge was of timber  FIRST OF TIMBER  the materials at hand and most probably rudely put together This account is given by  Stow  from the report of  Bartholomew Linsted  alias  Fowle  last prior of  St Marie Overie  but was doubted because the work has been supposed to be too great and too disinterested for a college of priests who were to give up the certain profits of the ferry for those resulting precariously from an expensive undertaking Even the existence of a religious house before the Conquest has been suspected but the  Domesday  book puts that out of doubt by informing us  Ipse episcopus habet unum monasterium in Sudwerche  Numbers of useful as well as pious works in early days originated from the instigation of the churchmen who often had the honor of being called the founders when the work itself was performed by their devotees Neither is it to be supposed that they could keep it in repair the same zeal which impelled people to contribute to the building operated in the vestiture of land for its future support and this appears to have been done by several instances yet the endowments were so small that a supplementary tax was often raised  IN the bridge was burnt down By the year it grew so ruinous as to occasion its being rebuilt under the care of one  Peter  curate of  St Mary Colechurch  a celebrated architect of those times It was soon after determined to build a bridge of stone and about the year  REBUILT IN WITH STONE  the same  Peter  was employed again It proved a work of thirtythree years the architect died four years before it was completed and another clergyman  Isenbert  master of the schools of  Xainctes  was recommended to the citizens by king  John  for the honor of finishing it but they  rejected their prince's choice and committed the work to three merchants of  London  who completed it in  Peter  was buried in a beautiful chapel probably of his own construction dedicated to  St Thomas  C  P  IN ONE OF THE PIERE  which stood on the east side in the ninth pier from the north end and had an entrance from the river as well as the street by a winding staircase It was beautifully paved with black and white marble and in the middle was a tomb supposed to contain the remains of  Peter  the architect  THIS great work was founded on enormous piles driven as closely as possible together on their tops were laid long planks ten inches thick strongly bolted and on them were placed the base of the pier the lowermost stones of which were bedded in pitch to prevent the water from damaging the work round all were the piles which are called the  Sterlings  designed for the preservation of the foundation piles These contracted the space between the piers so greatly as to occasion at the retreat of every tide a fall of five feet or a number of temporary cataracts which since the foundation of the bridge have occasioned the loss of many thousand lives The water at springtides rises to the height of about eighteen feet The length of this vast work is nine hundred and fifteen feet the exact breadth of the river The number of arches was nineteen of unequal dimensions and greatly deformed by the sterlings and the houses on each side which overhung and leaned in a most terrific manner In most places they hid the arches and nothing appeared but the rude piers I well remember the street on  Londonbridge  narrow darksome and dangerous to passengers from the multitude of carriages frequent arches of strong timber crossed the street from the tops of the houses to keep them together and from falling into the  river Nothing but use could preserve the rest of the inmates who soon grew deaf to the noise of the falling waters the clamors of watermen or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches Most of the houses were tenanted by pin or needle makers  PINMAKERS  and oeconomical ladies were wont to drive from the  St James  's end of the town to make cheap purchases  Fuller  tells us that  Spanish  needles were made here first in  Cheapside  by a negro who died without communicating the art  Elias Crowse  a  German  in the reign of  Elizabeth  was more liberal and first taught the method to the  English Fuller  's definition of a needle is excellent  quasi  NE IDLE  IN the bridge were three openings on each side with ballustrades to give passengers a sight of the water and shipping In one part had been a drawbridge useful either by way of defence  DRAWBRIDGE  or for the admission of ships into the upper part of the river This was protected by a strong tower It served to repulse  Fauconbridge  the Bastard in his general assault on the city in with a set of banditti under pretence of rescuing the unfortunate  Henry  then confined in the  Tower  Sixty houses were burnt on the bridge on the occasion  Holinshed    It also served to check and in the end annihilate the illconducted insurrection of Sir  Thomas Wiat  in the reign of queen  Mary  The top of this tower in the sad and turbulent days of this kingdom used to be the shambles of human flesh and covered with heads or quarters of unfortunate partizans Even so late as the year  Hentzner  the  German  traveller with  German  accuracy counted on it above thirty  heads  Fugitive Pieces  vol ii  The old map of the city in represents them in a most horrible cluster  AT the south end of the bridge one  Peter Corbis  a  Dutchman  Stow's SurvaieLondon and its Environs  iv  in the year invented an engine to force the water of the  Thames  into leaden pipes to supply many of the adjacent parts of the city It has since that time been so greatly improved by the skill of the  English  mechanics as to become a most curious as well as useful piece of machinery and to be extremely worthy the attention of that branch of science  DREADFUL CALAMITY BY FIRE  I MUST not quit the bridge without noticing an unparalleled calamity which happened on it within four years after it was finished A fire began on it at the  Southwark  end multitudes of people rushed out of  London  to extinguish it while they were engaged in this charitable design the fire seized on the opposite end and hemmed in the crowd Above three thousand persons perished in the flames or were drowned by overloading the vessels which were hardy enough to attempt their relief  A BRAVE ACTION  THE gallant action of  Edmund Osborne  ancestor to the duke of  Leeds  when he was apprentice to Sir  William Hewet  clothworker must by no means be forgotten About the year when his master lived in one of these tremendous houses a servantmaid was playing with his only daughter in her arms in a window over the water and accidentally dropt the child Young  Osborne  who was witness to the misfortune instantly sprung into the river and beyond all expectation brought her safe to the terrified family Several persons of rank payed their addresses to her  when she was marriageable among others the earl of  Shrewsbury  but Sir  William  gratefully decided in favor of  Osborne  OSBORNE says he  saved her  and OSBORNE  shall enjoy her  Stow  ii book v and  Collins  's Peerage i  In her right he possessed a great fortune He became sheriff of  London  in and lord mayor in I have seen the picture of his master at  Kiveton  the seat of the duke of  Leeds  a half length on board his dress is a black gown furred a red vest and sleeve a gold chain and a bonnet He served the office of lord mayor in and died in  Strype  mistakes when he says that Sir  William  died in and was buried in the cathedral of  St Paul  another person of the same name lies there under the handsome monument  Engraven in  Dugdale  's History of  St Paul's    ascribed by our old historian to the former  Or the multitudes who have perished in this rapid descent the names of no one of any note has reached my knowlege except that of Mr  Temple  only son of the great Sir  William Temple  His end was dreadful as it was premeditated He had a week before accepted from king  William  the office of Secretary of War On the th of  April  he hired a boat on the  Thames  and directed the waterman to shoot the bridge at that instant he flung himself into the torrent and having filled his pockets with stones to destroy all chance of safety  Rereshy's Memoirs    instantly sunk In the boat was found a note to this effect  My folly in undertaking what I could not perform whereby some misfortunes have befallen the king's service is the cause of my putting myself to  this sudden end I wish him success in all his undertakings and a better servant  I hope his father's reflection on the occasion was a parental apology not his real sentiments  That a wise man might dispose of himself and make his life as short as he pleased  How strongly did this great man militate against the precepts of Christianity and the solid arguments of a most wise and pious heathen  CICERO in his  Somnium Scipionis    CHURCH OF ST MAGNUS  VERY near to the northern end of the bridge is the church of  St Magnus  It is probably a church of great antiquity yet the first mention is in It was consumed in the great fire but within ten years was restored in the present handsome style The bottom of the tower is open so as to admit a most convenient thoroughfare to the numerous passengers  A LITTLE higher up on the left hand is  Eastcheap  immortalized by SHAKESPEARE as the place of rendezvous of Sir  John Falstaff  and his merry companions Here stood the  Boar's Head  tavern the site is now covered with modern houses but in the front of one is still preserved the memory of the sign the  Boar's Head  cut in stone Notwithstanding the house is gone we shall laugh at the humour of the jovial knight his hostess  Bardolph  and  Pistol  as long as the descriptive pages of our great dramatic writer exist in our entertained imagination I must mention that in the wall of another house is a  Swan  cut in stone probably in old times the sign of another tavern  THE renowned  Henry  prince of  Wales  was not the only one of the royal family whose youthful blood led them into frolic and  A VIEW  PART of LONDON as it appeared in the GREAT FIRE of  Original Painting in Painter  Hall  riot His brothers  John  and  Thomas  with their attendants between two and three o'clock after midnight raised such an uproar that the mayor and sheriffs thought proper to interfere This the princes took as an insult on their dignity The magistrates were convened by the celebrated chief justice  Gascoigne  they stood on their defence and were most honorably dismissed it being proved that they did no more than their duty towards the maintenance of the peace  Stow's Survaie      THIS street was famous in old times for its convivial doings  The cookes cried hot ribbes of beef rosted pies well baked and other victuals  The same  there was clattering of pewter pots harpe pipe and sawtrie  Evident marks of the jollity of this quarter  IN  Puddinglane  at a very small distance from this church  FIRE IN  begun the evermemorable calamity by fire on the d of  September  In four days it consumed every part of this noble city within the walls except what lies within a line drawn from the north part of  Colemanstreet  and just to the southwest of  Leadenhall  and from thence to the  Tower  Its ravages were also extended without the walls to the west as far as  Fetterlane  and the  Temple  As it begun in  Puddinglane  it ended in  Smithfield  at  Pyecorner  which might occasion the inscription with the figure of a boy on a house in the last place now almost erased which attributes  the fire of  LONDON  to the sin of gluttony  I leave the reader to consult the second volume of the  City Remembrancer  for the melancholy detail  SIR  Christopher Wren  was coeval to this misfortune The plans his great genius offered to the public for rebuilding the city with genuine taste and a splendor worthy of ancient  Rome  were unfortunately rejected Perhaps the times are not greatly to be blamed there were a thousand difficulties in respect to the division of property there was in a vast commercial city such as  London  a hurry to resume their former occupations and a prejudice for ancient sites It was difficult to persuade people to relinquish for a mere work of taste a spot productive of thousands to them or their predecessors These things considered it is not to be wondered that we are left to admire on paper only the vast designs of our great architect But still he was the restorer of several of our public buildings many of our temples arose with improved beauty from his plans and several other buildings which we have had or shall have occasion of mentioning  THE MONUMENT  THAT astonishing proof of his genius the  Monument  is placed on the side of  Fishstreet  very near to the spot where the calamity began  Where  London  's column pointing at the skies  Like a tall bully lifts its head and lyes  It is a  Doric  column two hundred and two feet high fluted and finished with a trifling urn with flames instead of a noble statue of the reigning king as the great architect proposed On the west side of the pedestal is a bas relief cut by  Gabriel Cibber  in admirable taste It represents emblematically this sad  catastrophe Charles  is seen surrounded with Liberty Genius and Science giving directions for the restoring of the city Here the sculptor  found luckily one example to compliment the attention of the thoughtless monarch towards the good of his subjects for during the horrors of the conflagration and after it was subdued his endeavours to stop the evil and to remedy the effect were truly indefatigable The king was seriously affected by this calamity and many emotions of piety and devotion were excited in him There was for a short time great reason to expect the fruits of this his brief return to Heaven but they were quickly blasted by the uncommon wickedness of the people about him who by every prophane witticism on the recent calamity and even by suggesting that it was the blessing of God to humble this rebellious city and to prepare it for his yoke soon removed every good thought from the royal breast  Continuation of Lord  Glarendon  's Life  This noble column was begun in and finished in at the expence of £ A melancholy period of party rage and the inscription was permitted The damage sustained by the cruel element was computed at ten millions seven hundred and sixteen thousand pounds But Providence mingling mercy with justice suffered only the lost of a very few lives  GREAT as this calamity was yet it proved the providential cause of putting a stop to one of a far more tremendous nature The plague which for a series of ages had with very short intervals visited our capital in its most dreadful forms never appeared there again after the rebuilding of the city in a more open and airy manner which removed several nusanoes which if not the actual origin of a plague was assuredly one great  pabulum  when  it had seized our streets The last was in the year when in about six months by the smallest computation a hundred and threescore thousand people fell by the destroying angel  ALMOST opposite to the place where the monument now stands was a large stone house the habitation of  Edward  our famous black prince the flower of  English  chivalry In  Stow  's time it was altered to a common hosterie or inn having a black bell for the sign  Survai        FISHMONGERSHALL  AT a small distance to the west of the bridge is  Fishmongershall  a very handsome building erected since the destruction of the old hall by the great fire It faces the river and commands a fine view of the water and the bridge In the courtroom are several pictures of the various sorts of vendible fishes A printed catalogue of the species and varieties with their seasons was presented to me when I visited the place At this and every other hall I met with the utmost urbanity As an humble historian of the fishy tribe I trust that I am not to be condemned to the  Pygmalion  prospect of these delicacies but on my next visit to town may be honored with a card in order to form a practical judgment of what hitherto  only feasted my eyes  IN the great hall is a wooden statue of the brave Sir  William Walworth  armed with his rebelkilling dagger here is also another of  St Peter  the former was of this company the latter with great propriety is adopted as its titular saint The arms of the benefactors are beautifully expressed in painted glass on the several windows  THIS is one of the twelve great companies it originally was divided into  Stockmongers  and  Saltfishmongers  the first were incorporated in a period in which we had very considerable trade with  Iceland  in that very article  See  Arct Zool Introd  the last not till but were united in There was once a desperate feud between this company and the Goldsmiths about precedency The parties grew so violent that the mayor and aldermen by their own authority were obliged to pronounce them rebels and even  bannifiati  or banished the city such of them who persisted in their contumacy  Stow  ii book v  I fear that in old times the Goldsmiths were a pugnacious society for I read in of a desperate battle between them and the Taylors in which numbers were slain This company pays £ a year to charitable uses  THE next place I shall take notice of to the west of this hall  COLD HARBOUR  was  Cold Harbour  mentioned as a tenement as early as the reign of  Edward  II A magnificent house was in aftertimes built on the spot which from its occupant Sir  John Poultney  four times mayor of  London  was in the style of the times called  PoultneyInn  POULTNEYINN  for the town habitations of most of the great men were called  Inns WarwickInn  w  palace of the great kingmaker and many others had the same addition In feudal days the town had no pleasures to attract the great they seldom came there but to support a cause as now and then is the case with a modern senator to make or unmake a king or lay the foundation of civil broils In it was the  Inn  of  John Holland  duke of  Exeter  and earl of  Huntingdon  who here gave a dinner and doubtlessly a very magnificent one to his halfbrother  Richard  II Next year it became the inn of  Edmund  of  Langley  earl of  Cambridge  but still retained the addition of  Poultney  In  Henry Holland  duke of  Exeter  lodged in it In  Richard  III granted it to  Garter  king of arms and his brother heralds In the time of  Henry  VIII it became the lodgings of  Tonstal  bishop of  Durham  On his deposal it was granted to the earl of  Shrewsbury  by  Edward  VI and changed its name to that of  Shrewsburyhouse  STEELYARD  TO the west of this place was the  Steelyard  a most noted quay for the landing of wheat rye and other grain cables masts tar flax hemp linen cloth wainscot wax steel and other merchandize imported by the  Easterlings  or  Germans  Here was the  Guildhalda Teutonicorum  or  Guildhall  of those people They were our masters in the art of commerce and settled here even before the eleventh century For we find them here in the year  at lest in the time of king  Ethelred  for the  Emperor  's men i e the  Germans  of the Steelyard coming with their ships were accounted worthy of good laws They were not to forestall the market from the burghers of  London  and to pay toll at  Christmas  two grey cloths and one brown one with ten pounds of pepper five pair of gloves two vessels of vinegar and as many at  Easter  The name of this wharf is not taken from  Steel  the metal which was only a single article but from  Staelhoff  contracted from  Stapelhoff  or the general house of trade of the  German  nation The powerful league of the  Hanse Towns  and the profits we made of their trade for they were for a long season the great importers of this kingdom procured for them great privileges They had an alderman of  London  for their judge in case of disputes and they were to be free from all subsidies to the  king or his heirs saving says the king to us and our heirs our antient prizes  prisis juribusque consuetudinibus costumisque  Rymer  xi  In return for these distinguishing favors they were to keep in repair the gate called  Bishopsgate  In they were called on to perform their duty the gate being at that time in a ruinous state they refused but being compelled by law  Gerard Marbod  their alderman advanced the necessary sum In it was even rebuilt in a most magnificent manner by the merchants of the  Steelyard  As they decreased in strength and we grew more powerful and more politic we began to abridge their privileges We found that this potent company by their weight interfered with the interest of the natives and damped their spirit of trade After several revocations and renewals of the charter the house in was shut up by our wise and patriotic queen and the  German  inhabitants expelled the kingdom  AT this time it is the great repository of the imported iron which furnishes our metropolis with that necessary material The quantity of bars that fill the yards and warehouses of this quarter strike with astonishment the most indifferent beholder Next to the waterside are two eagles with imperial crowns round their necks placed on two columns  IN the hall of this company were the two famous pictures painted in distemper by  Holbein  representing the triumphs of Riches and Poverty They were lost being supposed to have been carried into  Flanders  on the destruction of the company and from thence into  France  I am to learn where they are at present unless in the cabinet of M  Fleischman  at  HesseDarmstadt  The celebrated  Christian a Mechel  of  Basil  has lately published two engravings of these pictures either from the originals or the drawings by  Zucchero  for  Frid Zucchero  is at one corner of each print Drawings of these pictures were found in  England  by  Vertue  ascribed to  Helbein  and the verses over them to Sir  Thomas More  Mr  Walpole  's Anecdotes i  It appears that  Zucchero  copied them at the  Steelyard  The same p  so probably those copies in process of time might have fallen into the hands of M  Fleischman  IN the triumph of Riches  Plutus  is represented in a golden car and  Fortune  sitting before him flinging money into the laps of people holding up their garments to receive her favors  Ventidius  is wrote under one  Gadareus  under another and  Themistocles  under a man kneeling beside the car  Croesus Midas  and  Tantalus  follow  Narcissus  holds the horse of the first over their heads in the clouds is  Nemesis  There are various allegorical figures I shall not attempt to explain By the sides of the horses walk dropsical and other diseased figures the too frequent attendants of riches  POVERTY appears in another car mean and shattered half naked squalid and

replete with wretchedness and discontent  NOT remote from hence formerly stood the  Erber  THE ERBER  a vast house or palace  Edward  III for it is not traced higher granted it to one of the noble family of the  Scroopes  from them it fell to the  Nevills Richard  the great earl of  Warwick  possessed it and lodged here his father the earl of  Salisbury  with five hundred men in the famous congress of barons in the year in which  Henry  VI may be said to have been virtually deposed It often changed masters  Richard  III repaired it in whose time it was called the  King's Palace  It was rebuilt by Sir  Thomas Pullison  mayor in and afterwards dignified by being the residence of our illustrious navigator Sir  Francis Drake  BEYOND the  Steelyards  is  Dowgate  now a place of little note  DOWGATE  Here stood one of the  Roman  gates through which was the way for passengers who took boat at the  trajectus  or ferry into the continuation of the military way towards  Dover  The  Britons  are supposed to have given it the name of  Dwr  or  Dwy  water and the  Saxons  added the word  gate  which signifies way It became a noted wharf and was called the port of  Downgate  In the time of  Henry  III and  Edward  III customs were to be paid by ships resting there in the same manner as if they rode at  Queenhithe  NEAR  Dowgate  runs concealed into the  Thames  the antient  Walbrook  or river of  Wells  mentioned in a charter of the Conqueror to the college of  St Martin le Grand  It rises to the north of  Moorfields  and passed through  London Wall  between  Bishopsgate  and  Moorgate  and ran through the city for a long time it was quite exposed and had over it several bridges which were maintained by the priors of certain religious houses and  others Between two and three centuries ago it was vaulted over with brick  Stow's S  rva  e    the top paved and formed into a street and for a long time past known only by name  THREE CRANES  THE Three Cranes in the  Vintry  was the next wharf which in old times by royal order was allotted for the landing of wines as the name imports The  Cranes  were the three machines used for the landing of the wines such as we use to this day In the adjacent lane was the  Painted Tavern  famous as early as the time of  Richard  II  VINTRIE  In this neighborhood was the great house called the  Vintrie  with vast winevaults beneath Here in resided Sir  John Gisors  lord mayor and constable of the  Tower  But the memorable feasting of another owner Sir  Henry Picard  vintner lord mayor in must not be forgotten who  in one day did sumptuously feast  Edward  king of  England John  king of  France  the king of  Cipres  then arrived in  England David  king of  Scots Edward  prince of  Wales  with many noblemen and other and after the sayd  Henry Picard  kept his hall against all commers whosoeuer that were willing to play at dice and hazard In like manner the lady  Margaret  his wife did also keepe her chamber to the same intent The king of  Cipres  playing with  Henry Picard  in his hall did winne of him fifty markes but  Henry  beeing very skilfull in that art altering his hand did after winne of the same king the same fifty markes and fifty markes more which when the same king began to take in ill part although hee dissembled the same  Henry  said unto him My lord and king be not agreeued I court not your gold but your play for I have not bidd  you hither that I might grieue but that amongst other things I might your play and gave him his money againe plentifully bestowing of his owne amongst the retinue besides he gave many rich gifts to the king and other nobles and knights which dined with him to the great glory of the cittizens of  London  in those days  Stow's Annals      VINTNERSHALL faces  Thames street  VINTNERSHALL  It is distinguished by the figure of  Bacchus  striding his tun placed on the columns of the gate In the great hall is a good picture of  St Martin  on a white horse dividing his cloak with our Saviour who appeared to him in the year in the character of a beggar  Hic CHRISTO chlamydem  Martinus  dimidiavit  Ut faciamus idem nobis exemplificavit  There is besides a statue of that saint in the same room and another picture of him above stairs Why this saint was selected as patron of the company I know not except they imagined that the saint actuated by good wine had been inspired with good thoughts which according to the argument of  James Howel  producing good works brought a man to Heaven And to shew the moral in a contrary effect here is a picture of  Lot  and his incestuous daughters exemplifying the danger of the abuse of the best things  THIS hall was built on ground given by Sir  John Stodie  vintner lord mayor in It was called the manour of the  Vintre  The  Vintners  or  Vintonners  were incorporated in the reign of  Edward  III They were originally divided into  Vinetarii et Tabernarii  Vintners  who imported the wine and  Taverners  who kept taverns and retailed it for the former The company flourished so much that from its institution till the year it produced not fewer than fourteen lord mayors many of which were the keepers of taverns Yet in the time of  Edward  III the  Gascoigne  wines were not sold at the rate of above  d  a gallon nor the  Rhenish  above  d  In red wine was  d  a gallon and a little after the price of a tun £ As late as the year the  Gu  nne  and  Gascoigne  wines were sold at  d  a gallon and no wines were to exceed the price of  d  To restrain luxury it was at the same time enacted that no person except those who could expend marks annually or was worth marks or was the son of a duke marquiss earl viscount or baron of the realm should keep in his house any vessel of wine for his family use exceeding ten gallons under penalty of ten pounds  OUR great wine trade was at first with  Bourdeaux  and the neighboring provinces it commenced as early as the Conquest perhaps sooner  Cambden  i  But it became very considerable in the reign of  Henry  II by reason of his marriage with  Elianor  daughter of the duke of  Aquitaine  our conquest of that and other great wineprovinces of  France  increased the trade to a high degree and made great fortunes among the adventurers of this company In aftertimes when sweet wines came into fashion we had considerable intercourse with the  Canary  islands  SIR RICHARD WHITTINGTON  I MUST not be silent about the celebrated Sir  Richard Whittington  three times lord mayor of  London  in and I shall leave the history of his cat to the friend of my younger  days  Punch  and his dramatical troop But will not omit saying that his good fortune was not without parallel for it is recorded  how  Alphonso  a  Portuguese  being wrecked on

was thrice buried once by his executors under a magnificent monument in the church which he had built but by the sacrilege of  Thomas Mountein  rector in the reign of  Edward  VI who expected great riches in his tomb it was broke open and the body spoiled of its leaden sheet and then committed again to its place  Stow's Survaie    In the next reign the body was again taken up to renew a decent covering and deposited the third time His epitaph began thus  Ut fragrans nardus fama suit iste  Ricardus  Albificans  villam qui justè rexerat illam  Flos mercatorum sundator Presbyterorum c  See  Stow  i book iii p  Albificans  alluding to his name    TOWER ROYAL  THE  Tower Royal  which stood in a street of the same name a little beyond this church must not pass unnoticed It was supposed to have been founded by  Henry  I and according to  Stow  it was the residence of king  Stephen  Whether it was destroyed by any accident does not appear but in the reign of  Edward  I it was no more than a simple tenement held by one  Simon Beawmes  In that of  Edward  III it acquired the title of  Royal  and the  Inn Royal  as having been the residence of the king under that name he bestowed it on the college of  St Stephen Westminster  but it reverted to the crown and in the time of  Richard  II was called the  Queen's Wardrobe  Stow's Survaie    It must have been a place of great strength for when the rebels under  Wat Tyler  had made themselves masters of THE TOWER and forced from thence the archbishop of  Canterbury  and every other victim to their barbarity this place remained secure Hither the princess  Joan  the royal mother retired during the time the rebels were committing every excess in all parts of the town and here the youthful monarch found her after he had by his wonderful calmness and prudence put an end to this pestilential insurrection  The same    IN this tower  Richard  in lodged when his royal guest  Leon  III king of  Armenia  or as  Holinshed  H  s  d

time of the  Saxons  This was one of the places for large boats and even ships to discharge their lading for there was a drawbridge in one part of  Londonbridge  which  was pulled up occasionally to admit the passage of large vessels express care being taken to land corn fish and provisions in different places for the conveniency of the inhabitants and other hithes were appointed for the landing of different merchandise in order that business might be carried on with regularity When this hithe fell into the hands of king  Stephen  he bestowed it on  William de Ypres  who in his piety again gave it to the convent of the  Holy Trinity  within  Aldgate  It again fell to the crown in the time of  Henry  III and then acquired its present name being called  Ripa Reginae  the  Queen's Wharf

OPPOSITE to  Queenhithe  on the south side of  Thamesstreet  is  Little Trinity Lane  where the company of Painterstainers have their hall These artists formed themselves into a fraternity as early as the reign of  Edward  III and also erected themselves into a company but were not incorporated They styled themselves  Painterstainers  the chief work being the staining or painting of glass illuminating missals or painting of portatif or other altars and now and then a portrait witness that of  Richard  II and the portraits of the great  John Talbot  and his wife preserved at  Castle Ashby  Journey to  London  In the year they found that plaisterers and all sorts of unskilful persons intermeddled in their business and brought their art into disrepute by the badness and slightness of their work They determined as the surgeons in later days to keep their mystery pure from all pretenders They were incorporated in had their master warden and common seal  George Gower  was queen  Elizabeth  's serjeant painter  Strype's Stow  ii book v p  but as I do not find his name in Mr  Walpole  's Anecdotes I suspect his art was confined to the humbler part This corporation extended only to such artists who practised within the city As art is unconfined numbers arose in different parts and settled in  Westminster  the seat of the court They for a long time remained totally unconnected even with each other About the year they solicited and received the royal patronage and were incorporated under the title of master wardens and commonalty of  Painterstainers  The majority are independent of any other body corporate but several among them are regular freemen of the city under the antient company  THE next remarkable place is  Baynard Castle  BAYNARD CASTLE  one of the two castles built on the west end of the town "with walls and ramparts" mentioned by  Fitzstephens  It took its name from its founder a nobleman and follower of the Conqueror and who died in the reign of  William Rufus  It was forfeited to the crown in by one of his descendants  Henry  I bestowed it on  Robert FitzRichard  fifth son of  Richard de Tonebrugge  son of  Gilbert  earl of  Clare  Dugdale  's Baron i  To this family did appertain in right of  the castle the office of castilian and bannerbearer of the city of  London  There is a curious declaration of their rights in the person of  Robert Fitzwalter  one of his descendants expressing his duty in time of war made in all the fullness of chivalry in before  John Blondon  then lord mayor It is there recited that  RIGHTS OF ROBERT FITZ  A  TE  C  IAN AND STANDARD  RER OF LONDON IN TIME OF WAR  The sayd  Robert  and his heyres ought to be and are chiefe bannerers of  London  in see for the chastilarie which he and his ancestors

Fitzwalter  IN TIME OF PEACE  and to his heires in the citie of  Lond  in the time of peace are these  that is to say The sayd  Robert  hath a soken or ward in the citie that is a wall of the canonrie of  Saint Paul  as a man goeth downe the street before the brewhouse of  Saint Paul  unto the  Thames  and so to the side of the mill which is in the water that commeth down from the  Fleetbridge  and goeth so by  London  wals betwixt the Friers preachers and  Ludgate  and so returneth backe by the house of the sayd Friers unto the sayd wall of the sayd canonrie of  Saint Paul  that is all the parish of  Saint Andrew  which is in the gift of his ancestors by the sayd signiority and so the said  Robert  hath appendant unto the sayd soken all these things underwritten That hee ought to have a sokemanrie or the same ward and if any of the sokemanry be impleaded in the  Guildhall  of any thing that toucheth not the body of the maior that for the time is or that toucheth the body of no sheriffe it is not lawful for the sokeman of the sokemanry of the sayd  Robert  and the maior and his citizens of  London  ought to grant him to have a court and in his court he ought to bring his judgements as it is assented and agreed upon in the  Guild hall  that shall be given them  IF any therefore be taken in his sokemanrie he ought to have his stockes and imprisonment in his soken and he

fastened two ebbings and two flowings of the water And if he be condemned for a common thief  he ought to be led to the Elmes and there suffer his judgement as other theeves And so the said  Robert  and his heirs hath honour that he holdeth a great franches within the citie that the maior of the city and citizens are bound to doe him of right that is to say that when the maior will hold a great counsaile he ought to call the said  Robert  and his heyres to be with him in counsaile of the citie and the said  Robert  ought to be sworne to be of counsaile with the city against all people saving the king and his heirs And when the said  Robert  commeth to the hustings in the  Guildhall  of the citie the maior or his lieutenant ought to rise against him and set him downe neere unto him and so long as he is in the  Guildhall  al the judgements ought to be given by his mouth according to the record of the recorders of the said  Guildhall  And so many waifes as come so long as he is there he ought to give them to the bayliffes of the towne or to whom he wil by the counsaile of the maior of the citie  IN the old castle was burnt  B  CASTLE BURNI AND R    it probably at that time had changed masters for it was rebuilt by  Humphrey  duke of  Gloucester  On his death it was granted by  Henry  VI to  Richard  duke of  York  In the important convention of the great men of the kingdom in the prelude to the bloody civil broils  Richard  lodged here with his train of four hundred men and all his noble partizans had their warlike suite Let me say that the kingmaking earl came attended with six hundred men all in red jackets embroidered with ragged staves before and behind and were lodged in  Warwicklane  in whose house there was often the scene of boundless hospitality the instrument of his furious spirit and boundless ambition  THIS mighty peer in all his castles was supposed to feed annually thirty thousand men But  Baynard Castle  was the scene of a still more important action in the youthful  Edward  assumed the name and dignity of king confirmed by a number of persons of rank assembled in this place after it had been conferred on him by a mixed and tumultuary multitude  THE usurper  Richard  in the very same castle took on him the title of king Here he was waited on by his creature  Buckingham  the mayor and such part of the citizens who had been prepared for the purpose of forcing the crown on the seemingly reluctant hypocrite SHAKESPEARE has made an admirable scene cut of this part of our history  Richard  III act iii sc vii  His successor repaired or perhaps rebuilt  Baynard Castle  and as if foreseeing a long series of peaceful years changed its form into that of a palace for quiet times According to the view I have seen it included a square court with an octagonal tower in the center and two in the front between which were several square projections from top to bottom with the windows in pairs one above the other beneath was a bridge and stairs to the river  Hol  shed      HENRY often resided here and from hence made several of his solemn processions Here in he lodged  Philip  of  Austria  the matrimonial king of  Castile  tempestdriven into his dominions and shewed him the pomp and glory of his capital  The same    THIS castle was the residence of Sir  William Sydney  who died chamberlain and steward to  Edward  VI And in this place  Mary  the gloomy queen of the gloomy namesake of the former  had her right to the throne resolved on and from hence her partizans sallied forth to proclame her lawful title At this time it was the property and residence of  William Herbert  earl of  Pembroke  a particular favorer of the rightful heir Her successor  Elizabeth  did him the honor of taking a supper with his lordship after supper her majesty went on the water to shew herself to her subjects her barge was instantly surrounded by hundreds of boats loud acclamations delivered from the heart music and fireworks testified the happiness they felt at the sight of this mother of her people Early hours were then the fashion for notwithstanding this scene was exhibited on the th of  April  she retired to her palace at o'clock  Strype's Annals    To the west of this stood the other of  Fitzstephen  's castles  TOWER OF MONTFICHET  the tower of  Montfichet  founded by  Gilbert de Montfichet  a native of  Rome  but related to the Conqueror he brought with him a strong force and fought gallantly in his cause in the field of  Hastings  Dagdale's Baron  i  By him was founded this tower its date was short for it was demolished by king  John  in after banishing  Richard  successor to  Gilbert  the actual owner  Stow's Survaie    The materials were applied in as before related to the building of the monastery of the  Black Friars  A LITTLE farther is  Puddle Dock  and  Puddle Dock Hill  PUDDLE DOCK  remarkable only for having in the latter the western termination of the long street called  Thamesstreet  THAMESSTREET  which extends eastward as far as the  Tower  a mile in length In early times the southern side  was guarded by a wall close to the river strengthened with towers These are mentioned by  Fitzstephens  as having been ruined and undermined by the river Lord  Lyttelton  justly observes that after the building of the  Tower  and the bridge there was no necessity of restoring these fortifications as it was impossible at lest after the bridge was flung across the  Thames  for any fleet to annoy the city It originally stood farther from the river than the present buildings and wharss a considerable space between the street and the water having been gained in a long series of ages  NOT far from  Puddle Dock  in old times stood an antient house of stone and timber built by the lords of  Berkely  a potent race of barons In the reign of  Henry  VI it was the residence of the great  Richard Beauchamp  earl of  Warwick  Stow's Survaie    who seems to have made himself master of this by violence among other estates of the  Berkelles  to which he made pretensions on the death of  Thomas  fourth lord  Berkeley  Dagdale's Baron  i    FROM hence I turn north till I gain the site of  Ludgate  On the left all is piety  Credolane Ave Maria lane Amen Corner  and  PaterNosterrow  indicate the sanctity of the motley inhabitants Before us rises the magnificent structure of  St Paul  's and its confined churchyard Before I mention that noble temple I pursue the left hand way to  Warwicklane  Where stands a dome majestic to the sight  And sumptuous arches bear its oval height  A golden globe plac'd high with artful skill  Seems to the distant sight a gilded pill  In prose the  College of Physicians  COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS  a society founded originally by Doctor  Linacre  the first who rescued the medical art from the hands of illiterate monks and empirics He studied in  Italy  and became physician to  Henry  VII and VIII  Edward  VI and the princess  Mary  He died in  See my friend Doctor  Atkin  's Biographical Memoirs of Medicine octavo  which a misjudging period discouraged him from completing  The college was first in  KnightRiderstreet  afterwards it was removed to  Amen Corner  and finally fixed here The present building was the work of Sir  Christopher Wren  On the top of the dome is a gilt ball which the witty  Garth  calls the gilded pill On the summit of the centre is the bird of  Aesculapius  the admonishing cock  ON one side of the court is a statue of  Charles  II on the opposite that of the notorious Sir  John Cutler  I was greatly at a loss to learn how so much respect was shewn to a character so stigmatized for avarice I think myself much indebted to Doctor WARREN for the extraordinary history It appears by the annals of the college that in the year a considerable sum of money had been subscribed by the fellows for the erection of a new college the old one having been consumed in the great fire eight years before It also appears that Sir  John Cutler  a near relation of Doctor  Whistler  the president was desirous of becoming a benefactor A committee was appointed to wait upon Sir  John  to thank him for his kind intentions He accepted their thanks renewed his promise and specified the part of the building of which he intended to bear the expence In the year statues in honor of the king and Sir  John  were voted by the college and nine years afterwards the college being then completed  it was resolved to borrow money of Sir  John Cutler  to discharge the college debt but the sum is not specified It appears however that in Sir  John  's executors made a demand on the college of £ which sum was supposed to include the money actually lent the money pretended to be given but set down as a debt in Sir  John  's books and the interest on both Lord  Radnor  however and Mr  Boulter  Sir  John Cutler  's executors were prevaled on to accept £ from the college and actually remitted the other five So that Sir  John  's promise which he never performed obtained him the statue and the liberality of his executors has kept it in its place ever since But the college wisely have obliterated the inscription which in the warmth of its gratitude it had placed beneath the figure  OMNIS CUTLER  CEDAT LABOR AMPHITHEATRO  ORTRAITE  IN the great room are several portraits of gentlemen of the faculty Among them Sir  Theodore Mayerne  a native of  Geneva  physician to  James  and  Charles  I The great  Sydenham  to whom thousands owe their lives by his daring attempt too long neglected of the cool regimen in the smallpox  Harvey  who first discovered the circulation of the blood And the learned and pious Sir  Thomas Brown  who said that the discovery of that great man's was preferable to the discovery of the New World  SIR  Edmund King  the famous transfuser of blood from one animal into another a discovery if pursued of infinite consequence in a moral as well as a physical light  A VERY good portrait of the anatomist  Ve  lius  on board by  n Calker  a painter from the dutchy of  Cloves  who died in  This celebrated character had filled the professor's chair  at  Venice  after that was for some time physician to  Charles  V Disgusted with the manners of a court he determined on a voyage to the  Holy Land  The republic of  Venice  sent to him to fill the professorship of medicine at  Padua  vacant by the death of  Fallopius  On his return in he was shipwrecked on the isle of  Zanta  where he perished by hunger  Doctor  Goodal  the  Stentor  of  Garth  's dispensary and Doctor  Millington  whom the witty author compliments with the following lines and from what I understand with great justice  Machaon  whose experience we adore  Great as your matchless merit is your power  At your approach the baffl'd tyrant Death  Breaks his keen shafts and grinds his clashing teeth  THE portrait of Doctor  Freind  the historian of physic and the most able in his profession and the most elegant writer of his time must not be omitted The fine busts of  Harvey Sydenham  and  Mead  the physician of our own days merit attention and with them I close the distinguished list  THE library was furnished with books by Sir  Theodore Mayerne  And it received a considerable addition from the marquis of  Dorchester  WARWICKLANE took its name from its having in it the inn or house of  Richard Nevil  the great earl of  Warwick  whose popularity and manner of living merits recital  Stow  mentions his coming to  London  in the famous convention of with men all in red jackets imbrodered with ragged staves before and behind and was lodged in  Warwickelane  in whose house there was often six oxen eaten at a breakfast and every taverne was full of his meate for hee that had any  acquaintance in that house might have there so much of sodden and rost meate as he could pricke and carry upon a long dagger  Stow's Survaie      THE memory of this kingmaking earl is still preserved by a fine stone statue placed in the front of a house in this lane within two or three doors of the south side of  Newgatestreet  ANTIENT HOUSE  D  S  BRETAGNY  NOT far from hence near  Ave Marialane  stood a great house of stone and wood belonging in old times to  John  duke of  Bretagny  and earl of  Richmond  cotemporary with  Edward  II and III after him  was possessed by the earls of  Pembroke  in the time of  Richard  II and  Henry  VI and in the time of queen  Elizabeth  S H    by  Henry  lord  Abergavenny  To finish the anticlimax it was finally possessed by the Company of Stationers who rebuilt it of wood and made it their hall It was destroyed by the great fire and was succeeded by the present plain building The preceding owners might boast of their nobility their successors of their wealth for in that sad calamity lord  Clarendon  estimated that the loss of the company did not amount to less than two hundred thousand pounds  P  UL  CATHEDRAL  THE cathedral of  St Paul  more than fills the space of  Ludgatehill  The best authority we have for the origin of this church is from its great restorer Sir CHRISTOPHER WREN His opinion that there had been a church on this spot built by the Christians in the time of the  Romans  was confirmed when he searched for the foundations for his own design he met with those of the original  presbyterium  or semicircular chancel of the old church They consisted only of  Kentish  rubblestone artfully worked and  consolidated with exceeding hard mortar in the  Roman  manner much excelling the superstructure  Parentalia    He explodes the notion of there having been here a temple of  Diana  and the discovery of the horns of animals used in the sacrifices to that goddess on which the opinion had been founded no such having been discovered in all his searches  The same  What was found is mentioned in the th page of this book  THE first church is supposed to have been destroyed in the  Dioclesian  persecution and to have been rebuilt in the reign of  Constantine  This was again demolished by the pagan  Saxons  and restored in by  Sebert  a petty prince ruling in these parts under  Ethelbert  king of  Kent  the first Christian monarch of the  Saxon  race who at the instance of  St Augustine  appointed  Melitus  the first bishop of  London Erkenwald  the son of king  Offa  fourth in succession from  Melitus  ornamented his cathedral very highly and improved the revenues with his own patrimony He was most deservedly canonized for the very litter in which he was carried in his last illness continued many centuries to cure fevers by the touch and the very chips carried to the sick restored them to health  WHEN the city of  London  was destroyed by fire in this church was burnt the bishop  Mauritius  began to rebuild it and laid the foundations which remained till its second destruction from the same cause in the last century Notwithstanding  Mauritius  lived twenty years after he had begun this pious work and  bishop  Beauvages  enjoyed the see twenty more yet such was the grandeur of the design that it remained unfinished The first had the ruins of the  Palatine  tower bestowed on him as materials for the building and  Henry  I bestowed on  Beauvages  part of the ditch belonging to the  Tower  which with purchases made by himself enabled him to inclose the whole with a wall The same monarch granted besides that every ship which brought stone for the church should be exempted from toll he gave him also all the great fish taken in his precincts except the tongues and lastly he secured to him and his successor the delicious tythes of all his venison in the county of  Essex  THE steeple was finished in The noble subterraneous church of  St Faith Ecclesia Sanctae Fidis in cryptis  was begun in It was supported by three rows of massy clustered pillars with ribs diverging from them to support the solemn roof This was the parish church This undercroft as these sort of buildings were called had in it several chauntries and monuments  Henry Lacie  earl of  Lincoln  who died in made what was called the  New Work  at the east end in which was the chapel of our Lady and that of  St Dunstan  CHAPTERHOUSE  THE Chapterhouse was adjoining to the south transept was circular and supported by four central pillars and of more elegant  gothic  than the rest of the building This projected into a most beautiful cloister two stories high On the walls was painted the  Machabre  or dance of death a common subject on the walls of cloisters or religious places This was a single piece a long train of all orders of men from the pope to the lowest of human beings each figure has as his partner Death the first shaking his  remembering hourglass  Dugdale's Monast  i in which both print and verses are preserved See  Dugdale's St Paul  and  Stow's Survaie    Our old poet  Lydgate  who flourished in the year translated a poem on the subject from the  French  verses which attended a painting of the same kind about  St Innocent  's cloister at  Paris  The original verses were made by  Machaber  a  German  in his own language This shews the antiquity of the subject and the origin of the hint from which  Holbein  composed his famous painting at  Basil  THIS cloister the dance and innumerable fine monuments for here were crowded by far the most superb fell victims to the sacrilege of the protector  Somerset  who demolished the whole and carried the materials to his palace then erecting in the  Strand  FARTHER to the west adjoining to this south side was the parish church of  St Gregory  Over it was one of the towers which ornamented the western front It was called the  Lollards Tower  and was the bishop's prison for the heterodox in which was committed many a midnight murder That of  Richard Hunn  in was one most foul he was committed there he was hanged there by the contrivance of the chancellor of the diocese  Horsey  he was scandalized with suicide his corpse was ignominiously buried The murder came out the coroner's inquest sat on the ashes and they brought in a verdict of  wilful murder  against  Horsey  and his accomplices The bishop  Fitzjames  defended them The king interfered and ordered the murderers to make restitution to the children of the deceased to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds Yet the perpetrators of this villainy escaped with a pardon notwithstanding the king in his order  speaks to them as having commited what himself styles the cruel murder  Fox  's Martyrs ii to    THE last person confined here was  Peter Burchet  of the  Temple  who in desperately wounded our famous seaman Sir  Richard Hawkins  in the open street whom he had mistaken for Sir  Christopher Hatton  He was committed to this prison and afterwards removed to the  Tower  he there barbarously murdered  Stow    Kennet  ii  one of his keepers he was tried convicted had his right hand struck off and then hanged He was found to be a violent enthusiast who thought it lawful to kill such who opposed the truth of the gospel  THE style of the antient cathedral was a most beautiful  gothic  over the east end was a most elegant circular window alterations were made in the ends of the two transepts so that their form is not delivered down to us in the antient plans from the central tower rose a lofty and most graceful spire  DIMENSIONS OF THE CHURCH  THE dimensions of this noble temple as taken in were these the length six hundred and ninety feet the breadth a hundred and twenty the height of the roof of the west part from the floor one hundred and two of the east part a hundred and eightyeight of the tower two hundred and sixty of the spire which was made of wood covered with lead two hundred and seventyfour The whole space the church occupied was three acres and a half one rood and a half and six perches  Dugdale      WE may be astonished at this amazing building and naturally  enquire what fund could supply money to support so vast an expence But monarchs resigned their revenues resulting from the customs due for the materials which were brought to the adjacent wharfs they furnished wood from the royal forests prelates gave up much of their revenues and what was more than all by the pious bait of indulgences and remissions of penance brought in from the good people of this realm most amazing sums Pope  Innocent  III in gave a release of sixty days penance the archbishop of  Cologne  gave a few years before a relaxation of fifty days  Boniface  archbishop of  Canterbury  forty days In brief there was not a prelate who did not in this manner excite his flock to contribute liberally to this great and pious design  THE nave was supported by clustered pillars and round arches the style preserved by the  Normans  after the conquered  Saxons  The galleries and windows of the transepts were also finished with rounded arches The skreen to the choir and the chapel of our Lady were  gothic  The skreen remarkably elegant ornamented with statues on each side of the door at the expence of Sir  Paul Pindar  See  Dugdale's St Paul  p plates marked  We are obliged to the industry of  Hollar  for preserving this knowlege of its antient state His great employer Sir  William Dugdale  and that eminent artist were fortunately  coeval  The pen of the one and the  burine  of the other were in full vigour before the ravages of the great fire on multitudes of the choice antiquities of our capital To the same distinguished characters we owe our acquaintance with the tombs but we are not to expect in this church the number nor the elegance of those of  Westminster St Peter  the porter of heaven  had far the preference to the tutelar saint of this cathedral Few crowned heads crowded here  ETHELRED AND SEBBA  Dagda  e    except  Ethelred  and  Sebba  founders of the church and of  Saxon  race none were found within these walls  BUT if they were deprived of that boast they had the honor of receiving the remains of  JOHN OF GAUNT  Old  John  of  Gaunt  timehonored  Lancaster  the brother father and uncle of kings He died in and had a most magnificent tomb erected over him ruined by the fanatical soldiery of the last century He and his first wife  Blanch  lay recumbent beneath a rich canopy of tabernacle work his crest upon his  abacoc  or cap of state his shield and his mighty spear were hung on his monument as so many trophies  SHRINE OF ST ERKENWALD  Dugdale    IN point of time as well as sanctity the rich  gothic  shrine of  St Erkenwald  should have preceded which rested on his plain altar tomb No wonder if on account of the miracles before mentioned this shrine was a great resort of pious devotees It was enriched with gold silver and pretious stones by the dean and chapter who in employed three goldsmiths to work on it a whole year the wages of the most expert was only eight shillings a week the other two five shillings Of the gifts from devotees that of  Richard de Preston  of  London  grocer was most valuable being his best sapphire stones there to remain for curing of infirmities in the eyes  Dugdale  See  Boethius  de Lapid et Gem who treats of the virtues of the sapphyr    THE shrine of  Roger Niger  SHRINE OF ROGER NIGER  Dugdale    bishop of  London  in the thirteenth century was also in high repute A visit to his shrine was frequently enjoined to the indulgences given for the rebuilding of this church  HENRY LACIE the great earl of  Lincoln  EARL OF LINCOLN  Dugdale    an eminent warrior under  Edward  I particularly in the  Welsh  wars was buried in that part of the church of his own building called the  New Work  He died at his house in town called  Lincoln'sInn  He is armed in mail his body covered with a short gown his legs crossed for he had either the merit of visiting the  Holy Land  or which would entitle him to a right to that attitude made a vow to perform that expiatory privilege  SIR  John Beauchamp  a younger son of  Guy  earl of  Warwick  SIR JOHN BEAUCHAMP  Dugdale    in was interred here His figure lay armed and recumbent He was one of the founders of the order

great  John Talbot  who was interred at  Whichurch  in  Shropshire Margaret  countess of  Shrewsbury  A monument was designed by the friendship of one  John Wenlok  at the expence of a hundred pounds

ancestor of the earls of  Powis  DEAN COLET  Dugdale    AT the expence of the Mercers Company was erected a monument to the memory of  John Colet  the learned dean of  St Paul  's the intimate of  Erasmus  and all the eminent scholars of the time This compliment was payed him by the Mercers because his father had been of their company and twice lord mayor He was in the beginning of life luxurious highspirited and subject to excess in mirth and used a freedom of speech which he afterwards corrected He thought too much for the clergy of his days and often exposed the corruptions of the church This subjected him to persecution but he escaped unhurt At length he determined to retire from the world which he quitted for a better in He dedicated his great fortune to the founding of the school of  St Paul  's in honor of  Christ Jesu in pueritia  for a hundred and fiftythree scholars A handsome house is built for this purpose under the care of the Mercers Company His monument had his bust in  terra cotta  dressed in a gown and square cap and beneath it a skeleton laid on a mat rolled up under its head  THAT great and honest man Sir  Nicholas Bacon  SIR NICHOLAS BACON  Dugdale    lay here recumbent and notwithstanding he was a gownsman was singularly clad in complete armour beneath him are his two wives in gowns and short ruffs  SIR PHILIP SYDNEY the delight of the age  SIR PHILIP SYDNEY  Dugdale    the most heroic and virtuous character of his time had no more than a board with a most wretched inscription of eight verses to record a same which nothing can injure His remains were brought here on  Jan  with the utmost magnificence There was a general mourning for him and it was accounted indecent for many months for any gentleman to appear at court or in the city in gay apparel  Memoirs of the  Sydnies  p  The partiality of an individual may mistake the qualities of a friend but the testimony of a whole nation puts his merits beyond dispute  THE memory of the great  Walsingham  also rests on his own deserts He died so poor  WALSINGHAM  Dugdale    that his friends were obliged to steal his remains into their grave for fear least they should be arrested By accident was left an old book of legends which I purchased an antient manuscriptlist of statesmen in the reign of  Elizabeth  consigned by the writer to the pains of hell for their zeal against the Catholics The st  Leicester all in fire  died d  Walsingham  the  Secretarie also in fire and flames  He died  Ap  No wonder since he could contrive to get the pope's pocket picked when his holiness was asleep of the keys of a cabinet by which he made himself master of an original letter of the first importance which proved the saving of our island from the machinations of its enemies  OWEN THE EPIGRAMMATIST  Dugdale  AS a  Welshman  I must not pass over the quibbling epitaph of the quibbling epigrammatist my countryman  John Owen  born at  Llanarmon  in  Caernarvonshire  educated at  Winchester  and elected fellow of  New College  Athenae Ox  n  i  He lived under the patronage of archbishop  Williams  and died in  Parva tibi statua quia parva statura supellex  Parva volat parvus per ora liber  Sed non parvus honos non parva est gloria quippe  Ingenio haud quicquam est majus in orbe tuo  Parva domus texit templum sed grande poetae  Tum verè vitam quum moriuntur agunt  DOCTOR DONNE  Dugdale    I WILL conclude with the melancholy corse of Doctor  Donne  the wit of his time standing in a nich and wrapped in a shroud gathered about his head with his feet resting on an urn Not long before his death he dressed himself in that funebrial habit placed his feet on an urn fixed on a board exactly of his own height and shutting his eyes like a departed person was drawn in that attitude by a skilful painter This gloomy piece he kept in his room till the day of his death on  March  after which it served as a pattern for his tomb  THE HIGH ALTAR  IT will be endless to enumerate the altars of this vast temple numerous as those of the  Pantheon  I content myself with the mention of the  High Altar  which dazzled with gems and gold the gifts of its numerous votaries  John  king of  France  when prisoner in  England  first paying his respects to  St Erkenwald  's shrine offered four basons of gold and the gifts at the  obsequies of princes foreign and  British  were of immense value On the day of the conversion of the tutelar saint the charities were prodigious first to the souls when an indulgence of forty days pardon was given  verè poenitentibus contritis et confessis  and by order of  Henry  III fifteen hundred tapers were placed in the church and fifteen thousand poor people fed in the churchyard  BUT the most singular offering was that of a fat doe in winter  SINGULAR OFFERING  and a buck in summer made at the high altar on the day of the commemoration of the saint by Sir  William de Baude  and his family and then to be distributed among the canons resident This was in lieu of twentytwo acres of land in  Essex  which did belong to the canons of this church Till queen  Elizabeth  's days the doe or buck was received solemnly at the steps of the high altar by the dean and chapter attired in their sacred vestments and crowned with garlands of roses  They sent the body of the bucke to baking and had the head fixed on a pole borne before the crosse in the procession untill they issued out of the west doore where the keeper that brought it blowed the deathe of the bucke and then the horners that were about the citie presently answered him in like manner for which paines they had each man of the deane and chapter four pence in money and their dinner and the keeper that brought it was allowed during his abode there for his service meate drinke and lodging and five shillings in money at his going away together with a loafe of breade having the picture of St  Paul  upon it  Warton  's Hist of Poetry ii    MYSTERIES  THE boys of St  Paul  's were famous for acting of the mysteries or holy plays and even regular dramas They often had the honor of performing before our monarchs Their preparations were expensive so that they petitioned  Richard  II to prohibit some ignorant and unexperienced persons from acting the  History of the Old Testament  to the great prejudice of the clergy of the church  BOY BISHOP  They had their  barnebishop  or  childbishop  who assumed the state and attire of a prelate Ludicrous as this holy counterfeit was dean  Colet  expressly orders that his scholars shall  every  Childermas  daye come to  Paulis churche  and heare the  chylde byshop  's sermon and after be at the hygh masse and each of them offer a penny to the  chylde byshop  and with them the maisters and surveyors of the scole  Stow  's  Survaie      This character was very common in many of the churches in  France  under the name of  L'evéque des foux  or  Archevêque des foux  They were dressed in the pontifical habits and sung such indecent songs danced and committed such horrible profanations even before the altar that at length they were suppressed by an arret of parlement  Memoires de la fete des foux pp  at the request of the dean and chapter of  Rheims  THE holiness of this place did not prevent thieves and profligates of all denominations lurking within the precincts and committing under favor of the night murders and every sort of crime  CHURCH AND BUILDINGS BELONGING TO IT INCLOSED WITH A WALL  Edward  I gave the dean and canons permission to inclose the whole within a wall and to have gates to be shut every night to exclude all disorderly people Within these walls on the northwest side was the bishop's palace  Froissart  tells us  that after the great tournament in  Smithfield  BISHOP'S PALACE  king  Edward  III and his queen lodged here I think on occasion of their nuptials  There was goodly daunsyng in the quenes lodging in presence of the kyng and his uncles and other barons of  England  and ladyes and damoyselles tyll it was daye whyche was tyme for every person to drawe to theyr lodgynges except the kynge and quene who laye there in the byshoppe's palayce for there theye laye al the feastes and justes durynge  Froissart Eng transt  ii civ    IT was a building of vast extent and frequently lodged our kings on different occasions The poor prince  Edward  V was brought here as he supposed to take possession of the crown and in the unhappy  Catherine  of  Arragon  was conducted to this palace to meet her young lover prince  Arthur  and on  Nov  was publicly married to him at St  Paul  's they returned to the palace where they were entertained with a splendid nuptial feast and resided here a few days till they were visited by the king and queen who took the royal pair with them by water from  Baynard Castle  to  Westminster  Holinshed      IN  Anne de Montmorenci  and others ambassadors from  Francis  I were magnificently lodged and entertained at this palace They were sent over to ratify the important treaties between the two monarchs and to compliment  Henry  with the order of St  Michael  See the same p  And in the  French  ambassador  Claude Annebau  admiral of  France  was splendidly lodged in the same  place  Maitland  ii  He was a favorite of  Francis  I and sent over to make peace between  Charles  V his master and  Henry  IN the reign of  Edward  VI the queen dowager of  Scotland  was here entertained The dean's house and the houses of the prebendaries and residentiaries were on the opposite side and in those days of plain living kept great housholds and liberal hospitality  The same    PAUL'S CROSS  BEFORE this cathedral was the famous  Paul's Cross  a pulpit formed of wood mounted upon steps of stone and covered with lead in which the most eminent divines were appointed to preach every  Sunday  in the forenoon To this place the court the mayor and aldermen and principal citizens used to resort The greatest part of the congregation sat in the open air the king and his train had covered galleries and the better sort of people if I may judge from the old prints were also protected from the injury of the weather but the far greater part stood exposed in the open air for which reason the preacher went in very bad weather  THE SHROWDS  to a place called the  Shrowds  a covered space on the side of the church to protect the congregation in inclement seasons Considerable contributions were raised among the nobility and citizens to support such preachers as were as was often the case called to town from either of the universities In particular the lord mayor and aldermen ordered that every preacher who came from a distance should be freely accommodated during five days with sweet and convenient lodgings fire candle and all necessaries And notice was given by the bishop  of  London  to the preacher appointed by him of the place he was to repair to  THE origin of the custom of preaching at crosses was probably accidental The sanctity of this species of pillar often caused a great resort of people to pay their devotion to the great object of their erection A preacher seeing a large concourse might be seized by a sudden impulse ascend the steps and deliver out his pious advice from a station so fit to inspire attention and so conveniently formed for the purpose The example might be followed till the practice became established by custom  IT certainly at first was a common cross and coeval with the church When it was first covered and converted into a pulpitcross we are not informed We are given to understand that it was overthrown by an earthquake in and that  William Courtney  then archbishop of  Canterbury  collected great sums for the rebuilding which says dean  Nowel  in a sermon he preached at this cross he applied to his own use  Courtney  was a most munificent prelate and not likely to abuse the charity of his flock yet it was not rebuilt till the time of  Thomas Kemp  elected bishop of  London  in who finished it in the form says  Godwin  in which we see it at present  Praesul Angl    Godwin  published his book in  and so it stood till it was demolished in by order of parlement executed by the willing hands of  Isaac Pennington  the fanatical lord mayor of that year who died in the Tower a convicted regicide  WE hear of this being in use as early as the year It was used not only for the instruction of mankind by the doctrine of the preacher but for every purpose political or ecclesiastical for  giving force to oaths for promulging of laws or rather the royal pleasure for the emission of papal bulls for anathematizing sinners for benedictions for exposing of penitents under censure of the church for recantations for the private ends of the ambitious and for the defaming of those who had incurred the displeasure of crowned heads  IN  Henry  III commanded the lord mayor to swear before the aldermen every person of twelve years and upwards to be true to him and his heirs  IN the same monarch caused the bull of  Urban  IV to be here made public as an absolution of him and his adherents who had sworn to observe the  Oxford  provisions made in the violent meeting at that city in called the  mad  parliament  HERE in  Ralph de Baldoc  dean of St  Paul  's cursed all those who had searched in the church of  St Martin in the Fields  for a hoard of gold c  THE PENANCE OF JANE SHORE  BEFORE this cross in was brought divested of all her splendor  Jane Shore  the charitable the merry concubine of  Edward  IV and after his death of his favorite the unfortunate Lord  Hastings  After the loss of her protectors she fell a victim to the malice of crookbacked  Richard  He was disappointed by her excellent defence of convicting her of witchcraft and confederating with her lover to destroy him He then attacked her on the weak side of frailty This was undeniable He consigned her to the severity of the church she was carried to the bishop's palace cloathed in a white sheet with a taper in her hand and from thence conducted to the cathedral and the cross before which she made a confession of her only fault Every other virtue bloomed in this illfated fair with the fullest vigour She  could not resist the solicitations of a youthful monarch the handsomest man of his time On his death she was reduced to necessity scorned by the world and cast off by her husband with whom she was paired in her childish years and forced to fling herself into the arms of  Hastings  "In her penance she went" says  Holinshed  in countenance and pase demure so womanlie that albeit she were out of all araie save hir kirtle onlie yet went she so faire and lovelie namelie while the woondering of the people cast a comelie rud in hir cheeks of whiche she before had most misse that hir great shame wan hir much praise among those that were more amorous of hir bodie than curious of hir soule And manie good folkes that hated hir living and glad were to see sin corrected yet pitied they more hir penance than rejoised therin when they considered that the Protector procured it more of a corrupt intent than anie virtuous affection  Holinshed      ROWE has flung this part of her sad story into the following poetical dress but it is far from depreciating the moving simplicity of the old historian  Submissive sad and lowly was her look  A burning taper in her hand she bore  And on her shoulders carelessly confus'd  With loose neglect her lovely tresses hung  Upon her cheek a faintish flush was spread  Feeble she seem'd and sorely smit with pain  While barefoot as she trod the flinty pavement  Her footsteps all along were mark'd with blood  Yet silent still she pass'd and unrepining  Her streaming eyes bent ever on the earth  Except when in some bitter pang of sorrow  To Heav'n she seem'd in fervent zeal to raise  And beg that mercy man deny'd her here  THE poet has adopted the fable of her being denied all sustenance and of her perishing with hunger but that was not fact She lived to a great age but in great distress and miserable poverty deserted even by those to whom she had during prosperity done the most essential services She dragged a wretched life even to the time of Sir  Thomas More  who introduces her story into his life of  Edward  V The beauty of her person is spoken of in high terms  Proper she was and faire nothing in hir bodie that you would have changed but you would have wished hir somewhat higher Thus saie they that knew hir in hir youthNow is she old leane withered and dried up nothing left but rivelled skin and hard bone and yet being even such who so well advise her visage might gesse and devise which parts how filled would make it a faire face  Hol  shed      THE late ingenious the Reverend Mr  Michael Tyson  made me a present of an etching of this unfortunate fair done by himself from the original in the provost's lodgings in  King's college Cambridge  Her hair is curled in short curls high above her neck and mixed with chains of jewels set in a lozenge form her neck and body as far beneath her arms are naked the first has two strings of pearls hanging loose round it over her shoulders is a rich chain of jewels set in circles and pendant from the  middle which hangs down her breast is a rich lozenge of jewels and to each link is affixed one or more pearls In her countenance is no appearance of charms she must have attracted the hearts of her lovers by her intellectual beauties  UNDER her cruel persecutor  PROSTITUTE PREACH  S  this pulpitcross became the seat of prostituted eloquence The usurper made use of Doctor  Shaw  brother to his creature the lord mayor and friar  Pinke  an  Augustine  both says  Stow  doctors of divinity both great preachers both of more learning than virtue as his engines They addressed the people and inferred the bastardy of his brother's children and enlarged on the great qualities of their ambitious employers But  Pinke  lost his voice in the middle of his sermon and was forced to descend and  Shaw  was afterwards struck with such remorse finding himself despised by all the world that he soon after died of a broken heart  See  Fabian    Holinshed    Stow's Annals      ROYAL contracts of marriage were notified to the people from this place Thus that between  Margaret  ROYAL CONTRACTS OF MARRIAGE  daughter of  Henry  VII and  James  the IVth of  Scotland  was here declared in  Te Deum  was sung twelve bonfires set a blazing and twelve hogsheads of  Gascoigne  wine given to the populace  Stow's Annals      BUT the most famous preachments ever made here  PAPAL BULLS PREACHED DOWN  were those done by order of  Henry  VIII who compelled the bishop of  London  to send up to  Paules Cross from Sonday to Sonday  preachers to preach down the pope's authority to shew to the people that he was no more than the simple bishop of  Rome  and that his usurpations were only the effect of the negligence of the princes  of this realm  Weever  's Funeral Monuments  And thus his holiness's bulls were fairly baited out of the kingdom by his own dogs  PENITENCE OF HENRY VIII  FROM this pulpit was proclamed to the people by  Henry Holbetch  bishop of  Rochester  the deathbed remorse of the same tyrant who finding the stroke inevitable he ordered the church of the  Grey Friars  which he had converted into a storehouse to be cleared of the goods and opened for divine service and presented by patent to the city for the relieving of the poor  Stowe's  urvaie      RECANTATIONS  MANY are the examples of persons bearing the faggot and of making public recantation of their faith of both religions at this place The Reformers bore that badge as a mark of their escape the Catholics were excused from the burning therefore were excused from the burden The last who appeared was a seminary priest who in made his recantation In Sir  Thomas Newman  priest bore the faggot here on a singular occasion for singing mass with good ale To this place  Henry Grey  duke of  Suffolk  sent his chaplain  Harding  to dissuade the people from revolting from their allegiance to queen  Mary  Fox's Martyrs  yet actuated by weakness and ambition concurred in setting up his unhappy daughter  Jane Grey  in opposition to his rightful sovereign  WE are told in  Strype's Memorials  III that queen  Mary  made use of the same arts in the same place and appointed several of her best divines to preach the old religion and her design of restoring the antient worship but so averse were the people  that the attempt was attended with great tumults These she allayed by the temporary expedients of fire and faggot  THE reign of queen  Elizabeth  was wisely ushered in by the appointment of good and able men to preach from this Cross the doctrine of the Reformation and rejection of the Papal power  Strype's Annals  i    THE REFORMATION PREACHED FROM HENCE  in which politics were naturally intermixed This began  April  the th with doctor  Bill  the queen's almoner he was followed by  Grindal Horn Jewel Sandys  and many others who soon after enjoyed the highest dignities in our church  THE same heroine giving way to a most ungenerous passion  ESSEX CALUMNIATED  caused from this pulpit the memory of her oncebeloved  Essex  to be blackened to suffer  the indignity of a sermon at  Paul's Cross  set out in command Some sparks of indignation remaining in the queen that were unquenched even by his blood  Wotton's Remains  edit d p    IT was more worthily employed  DEFEAT OF THE ARMADA ANNOUNCED  when her majesty caused from thence a sermon of thanksgiving to Providence in for the signal deliverance her subjects received from the  invincible armada  of  Philip  II  AFTER the battle of St  Quintin  her predecessor queen  Mary  BATTLE OF ST QUINTIN  caused doctor  Harpsfield  to preach a sermon and from this Cross to give the people information of the victory gained by the general of her husband  Philip  of  Spain  over the  French  and of the succeeding capture of St  Quintin  before which that monarch the only time in his life appeared clad in armour  IN  LEVIES INCITED  while the lord mayor and aldermen were attending a sermon at this place they received an order from the queen to  levy a thousand ablebodied men They quitted their devotions and performed their commission before eight at night and had them ready armed for their march before morning The service they were designed for was to assist the  French  in raising the siege of  Calais  then besieged by the  Spaniards  but the place being taken by the time they reached  Dover  they returned to the city after a week's absence From the usual policy of  Elizabeth  it is possible the sermon and order were both preconcerted the moment of devotion being the aptest to inspire zeal and promote an enthusiastic ardor in the people to fly to a standard raised against a nation so detested and so inimical to our religion and liberties as the  Spaniards  JAMES I HEARS A SERMON AT THE CROSS  THE last sermon which was preached at this place was before  James  I who came in great state on horseback from  Whitehall  on  Midlent Sunday  he was received at  Temple Bar  by the lord mayor and aldermen who presented him with a purse of gold At St  Paul's  he was received by the clergy in their richest vestments Divine service was performed attended with organs cornets and sagbots after which his majesty went to a prepared place and heard a sermon at the Cross preached by  John King  bishop of  London  The object of the sermon was the repairing of the cathedral The king and the principal persons retired from the Cross to the bishop's palace to consult on the matter and after a magnificent banquet the court returned to  Whitehall  Stow's Annals    Hist London  I book iii    SPIRE OF THE CHURCH BURNT  I WILL not mention the different misfortunes this cathedral experienced except the last previous to its final destruction by the great fire In the noble spire was totally burnt by lightning  and never restored This circumstance shews the date of to  Aggas  's famous survey of  London  to have been erroneous he having given the church without the spire which he never could have omitted had it existed at that time  IN consequence of the resolutions taken in by  James  I to repair the cathedral the celebrated  Inigo Jones  was appointed to the work But it was not attempted till the year when  Laud  laid the first stone and  Inigo  the fourth That great architect begun with a most notorious impropriety giving to the west end a portico of the  Corinthian  order beautiful indeed to this antient gothic pile  Parentalia    and to the ends of the two transepts gothic fronts in a most horrible style The great fire made way for the restoring of this magnificent pile by Sir CHRISTOPHER WREN an architect worthy of so great a design I will not attempt to describe so wellknown a building the description is well done in several books easy to be had  London  and its Environs described in six vols vo Stranger's Guide through  London  duod Besides the larger works such as  Wren's ParentaliaMaitland's LondonStrype  's edition of  Stow  c  Sir  Christopher  made a model in wood of his first conception for rebuilding this church in the  Roman  style He had in it an eye to the loss of the  Pulpitcross  and had supplied its place by a magnificent auditory within for the reception of a large congregation This was approved by men of excellent judgment but laid aside under the notion it had not sufficiently a templelike form A second was made selected out of various sketches he had drawn on this design Sir  Christopher  set a high value but this also was  rejected  Parentalia    The third which produced the present noble pile was approved and executed A singular accident happened at the beginning while the great architect was setting out the dimensions of the dome he ordered a common laborer to bring him a flat stone to be laid as a direction to the masons he brought a fragment of a gravestone on which was the word RESURGAM This was not lost on  Sir Christopher  he caught the idea of the Phoenix which he placed on the south  Portico  with that word cut beneath  THE first stone was laid on  June  and the building was completed by him in  The same  but the whole decorations were not finished till  Maitland  ii  It was a most singular circumstance that notwithstanding it was thirtyfive years in building it was begun and finished by one architect and under one prelate  Henry Compton  bishop of  London  The church of St  Peter's  was a hundred and thirtyfive years in building in the reigns of nineteen popes and went through the hands of twelve architects It is not as often mistaken built after the model of that famous temple it is the entire conception of our great countryman and has been preferred in some respects by a judicious writer to even the  Roman Basilica  Its dimensions are less The comparative view is given in the  Parentalia  and copied in  London and its Environs  I will only mention the great outlinesthe height of  St Peter's  to the top of the cross is four hundred and thirtyseven feet and a half that of  St Paul's  three hundred and forty feet so that from its situation it is lofty enough to be seen  from the sea The length of the first is seven hundred and twentynine feet of the latter five hundred The greatest breadth of St  Peter's  is three hundred and sixtyfour of St  Paul's  one hundred and eighty  IN the reigns of  James  I and  Charles  I the body of this cathedral was the common resort of the politicians the newsmongers and idle in general It was called  Paul's walk  and the frequenters known by the name of  Paul's walkers  It is mentioned in the old plays and other books of the times The following droll description may possibly give some amusement to the reader  IT is the land's epitome or you may call it the lesser ile of  Great Brittaine  It is more than this the whole world's map which you may here discerne in it's perfect'st motion justling and turning It is a heap of stones and men with a vast confusion of languages and were the steeple not sanctified nothing liker  Babel  The noyse in it is like that of bees a strange humming or buzze mixt of walking tongues and feet It is a kind of still roare or loud whisper It is the great exchange of all discourse and no busines whatsoever but is here stirring and a foot It is the synod of all pates politicke joynted and laid together in the most serious posture and they are not halfe so busie at the parliament It is the anticke of tailes to tailes and backes to backes and for vizards you need goe no further than faces It is the market of young lecturers whom you may cheapen here at all rates and sizes It is the generall mint of all famous lies which are here like the legends popery first coyn'd and stampt in  the church All inventions are emptyed here and not few pockets The best signe of a temple in it is that it is the theeves sanctuary which robbe more safely in the croud then a wildernesse whilst every searcher is a bush to hide them It is the other expence of the day after playes taverne and a baudy house and men have still some oathes left to sweare here It is the eare's brothell and satisfies their lust and ytch The visitants are all men without exceptions but the principall inhabitants and possessors are stale knights and captaines out of service men of long rapiers and breeches which after all turne merchants here and trafficke for newes Some make it a preface to their dinner and travell for a stomacke but thriftier men make it their ordinarie and boord here verie cheape Of all such places it is least haunted with hobgoblins for if a ghost would walke move he could not  Microcosmographie      STATUE OF QUEEN ANNE  THE statue of queen  Anne  of white marble with the figures of  Britain France Ireland  and  America  at the base is placed before the western front This rose from the chizzel of  Francis Bird  as did the conversion of St  Paul  in the pediment and the hasreliefs under the portico  Anecdotes of Painting iii  Let the fine irony of Sir  Samuel Garth  whose spirit lay dormant till it rose in later days wrapped in the sheets of the eloquent  Junius  conclude all I have said of this majestic pile  Near the vast bulk of that stupendous frame  Known by the Gentiles great Apostle's name  With grace divine great  Anna  's seen to rise  An awful form that glads a nation's eyes  Beneath her feet four mighty realms appear  And with due reverence pay their homage there  Britain  and  Ireland  seem to own her grace  And ev'n wild  India  wears a smiling face  But  France  alone with downcast eyes is seen  The sad attendant of so good a queen  Ungrateful country to forget so soon  All that great  Anna  for thy sake has done  When sworn the kind defender of thy cause  Spite of her dear religion spite of laws  For thee she sheath'd the terrors of her sword  For thee she broke her gen'raland her word  For thee her mind in doubtful terms she told  And learn'd to speak like oracles of old  For thee for thee alone what cou'd she more  She lost the honour she had gain'd before  Lost all the trophies which her arms had won  Such  Caesar  never knew nor  Philip  's son  Resign'd the glories of a ten years reign  And such as none but  Marlborough  's arm cou'd gain  For thee in annals she's content to shine  Like other monarchs of the  Stuart  line  IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of this cathedral it was discovered beneath the graves mentioned at p that the foundation of the old church rested on a layer of hard and close pot earth Curiosity led Sir  Christopher Wren  to search farther He found that on the north side it was six feet thick that it grew thinner towards the south and on the decline of the hill was  scarcely four On advancing farther he met with nothing but loose sand at length he came to water and sand mixed with periwinkles and other seashells and by boring came at last to the beach and under that the natural hard clay which evinced that the sea had once occupied the space on which St  Paul  's now stands This sand had been one of those sandhills frequent on many coasts not only on those of  Holland  and  Flanders  but on our own It was the opinion of our great architect that all the space between  Camberwell  hill and the hills of  Essex  had been a vast bay at lowwater a sandy plain All which appears in some distant age to have been embanked possibly by the  Romans  Parentalia  p  who were greatly employed in that useful work  paludibus emuniendis  TO the south of this cathedral are the college of Civilians or Doctors commons the court of arches the court of delegates and several others the great satellites of the church The court of  arches  took its name  curia de arcubus  from having been once kept in  Bow church Cheapside  With the downfall of the church of  Rome  their powers decreased and continued decreasing as the rights of mankind became better understood  HERALDS COLLEGE  ON  Bennethill  adjacent to these courts is the  College of Heralds  a foundation of great antiquity in which the records are kept of all the old blood of the kingdom In the warlike times of our  Henries  and our  Edwards  the heralds were in full employ and often sent upon most dangerous services to hurl defiance into  the teeth of irritated enemies or to bring to their duty profligate rebels Sometimes it has cost them their nose and ears and sometimes their heads At present they rest safe from all harms are often of great use in proving consanguinity and helping people to supply legal clames to estates and often are of infinite use to our numerous children of fortune by furnishing them with a  quantum sufficit  of good blood and enabling them to strut in the motley procession of gentility  THE house they occupy was built on the site of  Derby  house a palace of the great family of the  Stanlies  It was built by the first earl fatherinlaw to  Henry  VII who in it lived and died as did his son  George  the intended victim to the rage of  Richard  III before the battle of  Bosworth Edward  earl of  Derby  that prodigy of charity and hospitality  Stow's Survaie    exchanged it with  Edward  VI for certain lands adjoining to his park at  Knowsley  in  Lancashire  Queen  Mary  presented it to  Dethick  Garter king of arms and his brother heralds to live in and discharge the business of their office  Collins's Peerage  ii  Stow    This house was destroyed in the great fire but soon rebuilt It is inhabited by several of the heralds  JC Brooke  Esq  Somerset  must permit me to acknowlege his frequent services and liberal communications  IN this neighbourhood to the west stood the royal wardrobe kept in a house built by Sir  John Beauchamp  who made it his residence It was sold to  Edward  III and became the lodging  Richard  III in his second year  KNIGHTRIDER STREET  CROSS  Bennethill  passes  Knightrider Street  so named from the gallant train of knights who were wont to pass this way in the days of chivalry from the  Tower Royal  to the gay tournaments at  Smithfield  From hence I pass to the  King's Exchange  or the  Old Change  a street parallel to the east side of St  Paul's church yard  which cross the  Roman road  or  Watlingstreet  and terminates close to the west end of  Cheapside  This was the seat of the  King's Exchanger  who delivered out to the other exchangers through the kingdom their coining irons and received them again when worn out with an account of the sums coined neither was any body to make change of plate or other mass of silver unless at this place  Stow's Survaie      IN this street stood the  College of Physicians  till it was destroyed by the great fire it was founded by the ornament of his age Doctor  Linacre  the greatest and most general scholar of the time He lived in this street and left his house to the public for the use of his institution He was appointed by  Henry  VII physician to prince  Arthur  and also his tutor He was besides physician to that monarch and  Henry  VIII and died in an honor to our country He had travelled much and was particularly respected by the reigning duke of  Tuscany  the politest scholar of his days and other foreigners and met with at home a return suitable to his merit  CHEAPSIDE  CHEAPSIDE received its name from  Chepe  a market as being originally the great street of splendid shops In the year it was an open field called  Crownfield  from an  hosterie  or inn with the sign of a crown at the east end "At the same period"  adds  Stow  at p of his  Chronicle  nor two hundred years after was any street in  London  paved except  Thamesstreet  and from  Ludgatehill  to  Charingcross  The goldsmiths shops were particularly superb "consisting" says  Stow  of a most beautiful frame of faire houses and shops than be within the walls of  London  or elsewhere in  England  commonly called  GoldsmithsRow  builded by  Thomas Wood  goldsmith and one of the sheriffes of  London  in It contained tenne faire dwelling houses and fourteen shops all in one frame uniformely builded foure stories high beautified toward the street with the goldsmithes arms and likeness of woodmen in memorie of his name riding on monstrous beasts all richly painted and gilt  Stow's Survaie      IN  Foster Lane  which opens into the west end of this street  GOLDSMITHS HALL  stands the hall of this opulent company In the courtroom is a fine portrait of Sir  Hugh Myddelton  with a shell by him out of which he may be supposed to have poured the useful element to the thirsting metropolis The words  Fontes Fodinae  are painted on the picture to imply his double attentions The wealth he got in the mines was totally exhausted in the execution of his project of which the metropolis to this moment receives increasing benefit Sir  Hugh  left a share in the New River to this company for the benefit of the decayed members which  even  in amounted to £  HERE is a good portrait of Sir  Martin Bowes  lord mayor in with his chain and robes of office The date of his picture is  ST  Dunstan  appears here in canvas in a rich robe and with his crosier The unfortunate devil is not forgotten roaring between the pincers of the saint with the heavenly host above applauding the deed It seems by this that St  Dunstan  amused himself in works of gold as well as iron so that it is no wonder to see the evil spirit in a place where the  irritamenta malorum  so much abound  QUEEN  Elizabeth  presented this company with a silver cup out of which annual libations are made to her memory She was particularly kind to the citizens and borrowed money of them on all occasions The goldsmiths must of course enjoy a distinguished place in her esteem  THIS company appeared as a fraternity as early as being then amerced for being  adulterine  or for setting up without the king's licence In the reign of  Edward  III they obtained a patent and were incorporated for the sum of ten marks  Richard  II confirmed the same in consideration of the sum of twenty marks They increased in wealth and have left evident marks of charity by having above a thousand pounds a year to dispose of for benevolent purposes They became in time the bankers of the capital The  Lombards  were the first and the greatest and most of the money contracts in old times passed through their hands Many of our monarchs were obliged to them for money They did not seem to like trusting  Henry  IV on his bond so took the customs in pawn for their loan  THE business of goldsmiths was confined to the buying and selling of plate and foreign coins of gold and silver melting them and coining others at the mint The banking was accidental and foreign to their institution  REGULAR banking by private people resulted in from the calamity of the time when the seditious spirit was incited by the arts of the parlementary leaders The merchants and tradesmen who before trusted their cash to their servants and apprentices found that no longer safe neither did they dare to leave it in the mint at the Tower by reason of the distresses of majesty itself which before was a place of public deposit In the year they began to place it in the hands of goldsmiths when they first began publicly to exercise both professions Even in my days were several very eminent bankers who kept the goldsmiths shop but they were more frequently separated The first regular banker was Mr  Francis Child  goldsmith who began business soon after the Restoration He was the father of the profession a person of large fortune and most respectable character He married between the years and  Martha  only daughter of  Robert Blanchard  citizen and goldsmith by whom he had twelve children Mr  Child  was afterwards knighted He lived in  Fleetstreet  where the shop still continues  For these particulars I am obliged to the civility of Mr  Dent  partner in this great shop  in a state of the highest respectability Mr  Granger  Vol iii  mentions Mr  Child  as successor to the shop of alderman  Backwel  a banker in the time of  Charles  II noted for his integrity abilities and industry who was ruined by the shutting up of the exchequer in His books were placed in the hands of Mr  Child  and still remain in the family  THE next antient shop was that possessed at present by Messrs  Snow  and  Denne  a few doors to the west of Mr  Child  's who  were goldsmiths of consequence in the latter part of the same reign To the west of  Temple Bar  the only one was that of Messrs  Middleton  and  Campbel  goldsmiths who flourished in and is now continued with great credit by Mr  Coutts  From thence to the extremity of the western end of the town there was none till the year when the respectable name of  Backwel  Of the same family with the great Mr  Backwel  He favored me with a beautiful print of his worthy relation which had been engraven in  Holland  after his flight from his profligate country  rose again conjoined to those of  Darel Hart  and  Croft  who with great reputation opened their shop in  Pall Mall  ST MARTIN'S LE GRAND  FOSTER LANE bounds on the east that remarkable place  St Martin's Le Grand imperium in imperio  surrounded by the city yet subject near three centuries to the governing powers of  Westminster Abby  A large and fair college was founded A D by  Wythred  king of  Kent  and rebuilt and chiefly endowed by two noble  Saxon  brothers  Ingelric  and  Edward  about the year  William  the Conqueror confirmed it in and even made it independent of every other ecclesiastical jurisdiction from the regal and even the papal  Newcourt's Repertertum  i c  It was governed by a dean and had a number of secular canons Succeeding monarchs confirmed all its privileges It had  Sak Sok Tol  and all the long list of  Saxon  indulgences enumerated by the accurate  Strype  Strype's Stow  i book iii  It had also from the beginning the dreadful privilege of sanctuary which was the cause of its being the resort of every species of profligates from the murderer to the pickpocket and was most tenaciously vindicated by its holy rulers In soldier who for some crime  was conducted from  Newgate  towards  Guildhall  was rescued by five fellows who rushed out of  Panyeralley  and who fled with him into the adjacent sanctuary The sheriffs of that year  Philip Malpas  and  Robert Marshall  entered the church and seizing on the soldier and other ruffians carried them chained to  Newgate  Strype's Stow  i book iii  The dean and chapter complained of this breach of privilege the cause was heard and the sheriffs were obliged to deliver the men into the sanctuary But in the king thought proper to regulate these privileges and to distinguish how far they might be protected and that the dean and chapter should take care that none of the villainous refugees should become further noxious to their fellowcreatures  The same p    A MAGNIFICENT church was erected within this jurisdiction which was continued till the college was surrendered in when it was pulled down and a great tavern erected in the place St  Martin's Le Grand  was then and still continues under the government of the dean of  Westminster  It was granted to that monastery by  Henry  VII It still continues independent of the city numbers of mechanics particularly taylors and shoemakers set up there and exercise their trades within its limits and have vote for the members of the borough of  Westminster  The dean and chapter have a court here and a prison and I think all processes to be executed within this liberty are to be directed by the sheriffs of  London  to the constable of the dean and chapter of  Westminster  THIS church with those of  Bow St Giles's Cripplegate  and  Barkin  had its  Curfew  bell long after the servile injunction laid on the  Londoners  had ceased These were sounded to give notice  to the inhabitants of those districts to keep within and not to wander in the streets which were infested by a set of ruffians who made a practice of insulting wounding robbing and murdering the people whom they happened to meet abroad during night  Strype's Stow  i book iii    CHEAPSIDE  THE view we have of  Cheapside  as it appeared just before the great fire shews that it was spacious and beautiful The cross and conduit are to be seen and the long row of shops which projected from the houses reached to the bottom of the first floors and were lighted by windows in the roofs This shews the antient forms of building our more magnificent streets On the south side stands the church of St  Mary le Bow  or  de arcubus  because it originally was built upon arches It perished in and was rebuilt after a design of Sir  Christopher Wren  's I cannot express myself better than in the words of an ingenious writer who calls it "a delightful absurdity  Critical Review c    " In this church was interred Sir  John Coventry  mercer lord mayor in and ancestor and founder of the family of the earl of  Coventry  I beg leave here to remind several other noble peers of their industrious and honest forefathers  JOHN COVENTRY son of  William Coventry  of the city of that name was an opulent mercer of the city of  London  and mayor in a most spirited magistrate who dared to interfere in the dreadful quarrel between  Humphrey  duke of  Glocester  and the insolent cardinal  Beaufort  which he successfully quelled from his loins is descended the present earl of  Coventry  SIR STEPHEN BROWN son of  John Brown  of  Newcastle  mayor  in and again in was a grocer and gave to us another peer in the person of Sir  Anthony Brown  created viscount  Mountague  by  Philip  and  Mary  in  THE  Legges  rose to be earls of  Dartmouth  The first who was nobilitated was that loyal and gallant sea officer  George Legge  created baron of  Dartmouth  in He was descended from an ancestor of one of the abovementioned names who filled the praetorian chair of  London  in the years and having by his industry in the trade of a skinner attained to great wealth  SIR GEFFRY BULLEN mayor in was grandfather to  Thomas  earl of  Wiltshire  father of  Anna Bullen  and grandfather to queen  Elizabeth  the highest genealogical honor the city ever possessed  SIR BAPTIST HICKS was a great mercer at the accession of  James  I and made a vast fortune by supplying the court with silks He was first knighted afterwards created viscount  Cambden  It is said he left his two daughters a hundred thousand pounds apiece He built a large house in St  John'sstreet  for the justices of  Middlesex  to hold their sessions which till its demolition a very few years ago upon the erection of a new sessionshouse on  Clerkenwell Green  retained the name of  Hicks's Hall  THE  Capels  earls of  Essex  are descended from Sir  William Capel draper  mayor in He first set up a cage in every ward for the punishment of idle people  MICHAEL DORMER mercer mayor in produced the future lord  Dormers  EDWARD OSBORN by his fortunate leap as before related when apprentice to Sir  William Hewet  attained in consequence great wealth and honors He was mayor in and from his loins sprung the dukes of  Leeds  FROM Sir  William Craven  merchanttaylor mayor in sprung the gallant earl  Craven  who was his eldest son and was greatly distinguished by his actions in the service of the unfortunate Elector Palatine by his attachment to the dowager and his marriage with that illustrious princess  LORD Viscount  Dudley  and  Ward  is descended from  William Ward  a wealthy goldsmith in  London  and jeweller to  Henrietta Maria  queen to  Charles  I His son  Humble Ward  married  Frances  granddaughter of  Edward Sutton  lord  Dudley  on the death of her grandfather baroness of  Dudley  and he himself created in lord  Ward  of  Birmingham  THE old church of  Bow  was founded in the time of  William  the Conqueror we have before given the origin of the name which was from the arches of the foundation not of the steeple which was rebuilt with arches or in a crown fashion but not till long after the year  Newcourt  's  Repertorium  i    STORY OF FITZOSBERT  In this tower in one  William FitzOsbert  alias  Long Beard  a seditious fellow of uncommon eloquence but of the lowest rank set up as advocate for the poorer citizens against the oppressions of the rich He took opportunity of beginning a tumult by inflaming their minds against a certain tax raised entirely for the necessities of the state Many lives were lost on the occasion at St  Paul's Hubert  the great justiciary summoned  Long Beard  to appear before him but found him so well supported that he thought it prudent to forbear punishment This served but to increase his insolence He grew so outrageous that the citizens were resolved to bring him to justice a resolute band made the attempt when he and a few desperate fellows fled to the tower of  Bow  steeple which they fortified The besiegers seeing the mob assemble from all parts to his rescue made a fire  at the bottom which forced him and his companions to sally out but they were taken and the next day he and eight more were dragged by their heels to the  Elms  at  Smithfield  and there hanged It was said that finding himself deserted by Heaven he at the gallows  forsook  Mary  's Son as he called our SAVIOUR and called upon the  Devil  to helpe and deliver him  Yet notwithstanding this a cunning priest a relation of his stole his body and pretended many miracles were wrought at the place of execution and many persons passed the night on the spot which deprived them of a  martyr  who died supporting the majesty of the people as  Thomas Becket  did that of the pope  IN the middle of the street a little to the west of the church  THE C  S  stood the cross and the conduit The first was one of the affectionate tokens of  Edward  I towards his queen  Elinor  built where her body rested in its way to interment in It had originally the statue of the queen and in all respects resembling that at  Northampton  at length falling to decay it was rebuilt in by  John Hutherby  mayor of the city at the expence of several of the citizens It was ornamented with various images such as that of the Resurrection of the  Virgin  of  Edward  the Confessor and the like At every public entry it was new gilt for the magnificent processions took this road After the Reformation the images gave much offence the goddess  Diana  was substituted instead of the  Virgin  after the symbols of superstition had been frequently mutilated Queen  Elizabeth  disapproved of those attacks on the remnants of the old religion and offered a large reward for the discovery of the offenders She thought that a plain cross the mark of the religion of the country ought not to be the occasion of any scandal so directed that one should be placed  on the summit and gilt  Stow's Survaie    Superstition is certain in course of time to take the other extreme In the year the parlement voted the taking down of all crosses and the demolishing of all popish paintings c The destruction of this cross was committed to Sir  Robert Harlow  who went on the service with true zeal attended by a troop of horse and two companies of foot and executed his orders most effectually The same most  pious  and  religious noble  knight did also attack and demolish "the abominable and  most blasphemous  crucifix" in  Christ  's hospital and broke it into a thousand pieces  Vicar's Parliamentary Chron  p  In short such was the rage of the times against the sign of our religion that it was not suffered in shopbooks or even in the primers of children  Gray's Hudibras  ii noteConsult also the note to  L'Hist de l'Entrèe de la Reyne Mere  printed for  W Bowyer  p  and as to the cross used in baptism it became the abomination of abominations  And some against all idolizing  The Cross in shopbooks and baptizing  THE  Nag'shead  tavern almost opposite to the cross was the fictitious scene of consecration of the Protestant bishops at the accession of queen  Elizabeth  in It was pretended by the adversaries of our religion that a certain number of ecclesiastics in hurry to take possession of the vacant sees assembled here where they were to undergo the ceremony from  Anthony Kitchen  alias  Dustan  bishop of  Llandaff  a sort of occasional conformist who had taken the oaths of supremacy to  Elizabeth Bonner  bishop of  London  then confined in the Tower hearing of it sent  his chaplain to  Kitchen  threatening him with excommunication in case he proceeded On this the prelate refused to perform the ceremony on which say the Catholics  Parker  and the other candidates rather than defer possession of their dioceses determined to consecrate one another which says the story they did without any sort of scruple and  Icorey  began with  Parker  who instantly rose archbishop of  Canterbury  The refutation of this tale may be read in  Strype  's Life of archbishop  Parker  at p which makes it needless for me to enter on the attempt A view of the tavern and its sign is preserved in a print in the  Entré de la Reyne Mere du Roy  or of  Mary de Medicis  when she visited our unfortunate monarch  Charles  I and her daughter his fair spouse  IN  Laurencelane  not far from hence was another publichouse of much antiquity and which is still in great business as a carriers inn the  Blossoms Inn  so named from the rich border of flowers which adorned the original sign that of St  Laurence  These were the effects of his martyrdom "for says the legend flowers sprung up on the spot of his cruel martyrdom"  IN this street between the cross and  Soperslane  were held most splendid tournaments in the year they began  Sept  and lasted three days A scaffold was erected for queen  Philippa  and her gay troop of ladies all most richly attired to behold the knights collected from all quarters to shew their skill in deeds of arms The upper part of the scaffold on which the ladies were seated "brake in sunder and" as  Stow  says  whereby they were with some shame forced to fall downe  and many knights and others which stood beneath much hurt The carpenters were saved from punishment by the intercession of the  queen but to prevent such accidents in future the king ordered a building of stone to be erected near the church of St  Mary le Bow  for himself the queen and "other states" to see the gallant spectacles in safety  Stow's Survaie    This was used long after for the same purpose even till the year when  Henry  IV granted it to certain mercers who converted it into shops warehouses and other requisites of their trade  The same    CONDUIT  A LITTLE to the east of the cross stood the conduit which served as the mother or chief aqueduct which was to serve the lesser conduits with water brought by pipes from  Paddington  This stood on the site of the old conduit founded in castellated with stone and cisterned in lead as  old Stow  tells us and again rebuilt in by  Thomas Ilan  one of the sheriffs On some very festive occasions these conduits have been made to run with claret Such was the case at the coronation of  Anna Bullen  who was received at the lesser conduit by  Pallas Juno  and  Venus Mercury  in the name of the goddesses presented to her a ball of gold divided into three parts signifying three gifts bestowed on her by the deities WISDOM RICHES and FELICITY But alas beneath them lurked speedy disgrace imprisonment the block and axe  THE STANDARD  I CANNOT well fix the place where the old Standard in  Cheap  stood The time of its foundation is unknown It appears to have been very ruinous in at which time  Henry  VI granted a licence for the repairing of it together with a conduit in the same This was a place at which executions and other acts of justice  were in old times frequently performed Here in  EXECUTIONS AT THE STANDARD  three men had their heads cut off for rescuing a prisoner arrested by a city officer In two fishmongers were beheaded at the standard but their crime has not reached us In  John Davy  had his hand struck off for striking a man before the judges at  Westminster  and in  Henry  IV caused the blank charters made by  Richard  II to be burned here as we do libels in our times  BUT these were legal acts Many sad instances of barbarous executions were done in the fury of popular commotions  Richard Lions  an eminent goldsmith and late sheriff of the city was in with several others cruelly beheaded here by order of  Wat Tyler Lions  was interred in the church of St  James Garlichith  and on his tomb now lost was his figure in a long flowered gown a large purse hanging in a belt from his shoulders his hair short his beard forked a plain hood falling back and covering his shoulders At the same time numbers of foreign merchants especially  Flemings  were dragged from the churches and the  Shibboleth  Judges  chap xii ver  of  Bread  and  Cheese  being put to them which they pronouncing  Brot  and  Cawse  they were instantly put to death In lord  Say  high treasurer of  England  lost his head at the Standard by the brutality of  John Cade Shakespeare  admirably describes the tragic scene  Henry  VI part ii    WHETHER  Walter Stapleton  bishop of  Exeter  suffered by the popular fury  Page of this Work  on this spot is rather uncertain some imagine  that he was beheaded at a cross before the north door of St  Paul's  Stow's Survaie      to which church he was flying for refuge and unfortunately seized by the mob before he had taken sanctuary  THROUGH this street and probably to this cross in walked barefooted with a tap  r in her hand  Elinor Cobham  wise to  Humphrey  duke of  Gloucester  charged with the crime of sorcery with intending the death of the king by melting an image of wax with which his body was to sympathize  Limus ut hic durescit et  haec  ut  cera  liquescit  In  Virgil  's time applied to melt the hearts of the cruel fair afterwards to waste the body of any hated person    A more serious fate attended her pretended accomplices a woman was burnt and three men among whom was her chaplain were hanged  GUILDHALL  THE  Guildhall  of this vast city stands at the end of a street running northward from  Cheapside  Before the year the courthall or  Bury  as it was called was held at  Aldermans bury  so denominated from their meeting there  Stow  remembered its ruins and says that in his days it was used as  Carpentershall  It was succeeded by a new one begun in and finished in twenty years by voluntary contributions by sums raised for pardons of offences and by fines Its  gothic  front terminates the end of  Kingstreet  Its length is a hundred and fiftythree feet its breadth fortyeight its height fiftyfive so that it is capable of holding thousands of people Elections and every species of city business is transacted here  WITHIN are portraits of numbers of our judges who frequently try causes under this roof I must direct the reader's attention to twelve of that order of peculiar merit these are the portraits of the able and virtuous Sir MATTHEW HALE and his eleven cotemporary judges who after the dreadful calamity of  regulated the rebuilding of the city of  London  by such wise rules as to prevent the endless train of vexatious lawsuits which might ensue and been little less chargeable than the fire itself had been This was principally owing to Sir  Matthew Hale  who conducted the business and sat with his brethren in  Clifford  's  Inn  to compose all differences between landlord and tenant These portraits were painted by  Michael Wright  a good painter in the time of  Charles  II and  James  II and who died in the year It was designed that Sir  Peter Lely  should draw these pictures but he fastidiously refused to wait on the judges at their chambers  Wright  received sixty pounds apiece for his work  Anecdotes of Painting iii  In the year they were found to be in so bad a condition as to make it an even question with the committee of city lands whether they should be continued in their places or committed to the flames To the eternal honor of alderman  Townsend  his vote decided in favor of their preservation  London's Gratitude  c  He recommended Mr  Roma  now unhappily snatched from us by death who by his great skill in repairing pictures rescued them from the rage of time so that they may remain another century a proof of the gratitude of our capital These  were  proofs of a sense of real  merit but in how many places do we meet instances of a temporary idolatry the phrenzy of the day Statues and portraits appear to the astonishment of posterity purged from the prejudices of the time  The things themselves are neither scarce nor rare  The wonder's how the devil they got there  FACING the entrance are two tremendous figures by some named  Gog  and  Magog  by  Stow  an antient  Briton  and  Saxon  I leave to others the important decision At the bottom of the room is a marble group of good workmanship with  London  and  Commerce  whimpering like two marred children executed soon after the year by Mr BACON The principal figure was also a giant in his day the rawhead and bloodybones to the good folks at St  James  's which while remonstrances were in fashion annually haunted the court in terrific forms The eloquence dashed in the face of majesty alas proved in vain The spectre was there condemned to silence but his patriotism may be read by his admiring fellowcitizens as long as the melancholy marble can retain the tale of the affrighted times  GREAT FEASTS  THE first time that this hall was used on festive occasions was by Sir  John Shaw  goldsmith knighted in the field of  Bosworth  After building the essentials of good kitchens and other offices in the year he gave here the mayor's feast which before had usually been done in  Grocershall  None of their bills of fare have reached me but doubtlessly they were very magnificent They at length grew to such excess that in the time of  Philip  and  Mary  a sumptuary law was made to restrain the expence  both of provisions and liveries but I suspect as it lessened the honor of the city it was not long observed for in the city thought proper to renew the order of council by way of reminding their fellowcitizens of their relapse into luxury Among the great feasts given here on public occasions may be reckoned that given in on occasion of the unhappy marriage of the prince  Palatine  with  Elizabeth  daughter of  James  I who in defiance of the remonstrances of his betterjudging fatherinlaw rushed on the usurpation of the dominion of another monarch and brought great misery on himself and his amiable spouse The next was in when  Charles  I returned from his imprudent inefficacious journey into  Scotland  In the midst of the most factious and turbulent times when every engine was set to work to annihilate the regal power the city under its lord mayor Sir  William Acton  made a feast unparalleled in history for its magnificence All external respect was payed to his majesty the last he ever experienced in the inflamed city Of the entertainment we know no more than that it consisted of five hundred dishes But of that which was given in our happier days to his present majesty in the mayoralty of Sir  Samuel Fludyer  the bill of fare is given us This I print and as a parallel to it that of another royal feast given in at  Whitehall  on occasion of the coronation of  Elizabeth  queen of  Henry  VII whom he treats with characteristical oeconomy notwithstanding a kingdom was her dower  The whole account is given in  Maitland  i to    The KING'S TABLE

ADJACENT to  Guildhall  is  Guildhall  chapel or college a  gothic  building founded by  Peter Fanlore Adam Francis  and  Henry Frowick  citizens about the year The establishment was  a warden seven priests three clerks and four choristers  Edward  VI granted it to the mayor and commonalty of the city of  London  Tanner  and  Newcourt  i  Here used to be service once a week and also at the election of the mayor and before the mayor's feast to deprecate indigestions and all plethoric evils  Newcourt  i  At present divine service is discontinued here the chapel being used as a justice room  ADJOINING to it once stood a fair library  LIBRARY  furnished with books belonging to  Guildhall  built by the executors of the famous  Whittington Stow  says that the protector  Somerset  sent to borrow some of the books with a promise of restoring them three  Curries  were laden with them but they never more were returned  Stow  's  Survaie      IMMEDIATELY beyond the chapel stands  Blackwall's hall  or  BLACKWALL'S HALL  more properly  Bakewell  from its having in later years been inhabited by a person of that name It was originally called  Basing's haugh  or hall from a family of that name the coats of arms of which were to be seen cut in stone or painted in the antient building It was on vaults of stone brought from  Caen  in  Normandy  the time is uncertain but certainly after the Conquest The family were of great antiquity  Solomon Basing  was mayor in and another of the name sheriff in In the house was purchased by the mayor and commonalty for fifty pounds and from that time has been used as the market of woollen cloth It grew so ruinous in the time of queen  Elizabeth  that it was pulled down and rebuilt at the expence of twentyfive hundred pounds much of it at the expence of  Richard  May  merchanttaylor It consists at present of two large courts with warehouses in all parts for the lodging of the cloth but is very little used Formerly there were proclamations issued to compel people to bring their goods into this hall to prevent deceit in the manufactures which might bring on us discredit in foreign markets and also be the means of defrauding the poor children of  Christ hospital  of part of the revenue which arose from the  hallage  of this great magazine  HOSPITAL OF ST THOMAS OF ACON  ON the north side of  Cheapside  stood the hospital of St  Thomas  of  Acon  founded by  Thomas FitzTheobald de Helles  and his wife  Agnes  sister to the turbulent  Thomas Becket  who was born in the house of his father  Gilbert  situated on this spot The mother of our meek saint was a fair  Saracen  whom his father had married in the  Holy Land  On the site of his house rose the hospital built within twenty years after the murder of  Thomas  yet such was the repute of his sanctity that it was dedicated to him in conjunction with the blessed Virgin without waiting for his canonization The hospital consisted of a master and several brethren professing the rule of St  Austin  The church cloisters c were granted by  Henry  VIII to the Mercers company who had the gift of the mastership  Tanner    NOW MERCER  HALL  IN the old church were numbers of monuments among others one to  James Butler  earl of  Ormond  and  Joan  his wife living in the beginning of the reign of  Henry  VI This whole pile was destroyed in the great fire but was very handsomely rebuilt by the Mercers company who have their hall here In the portico to the chapel is a fulllength figure recumbent of  Richard  Fishbourn  dressed in a furred gown and a ruff he died in and being a great benefactor to the place received the honor of this monument  THIS company is the first of the twelve or such who are honored with the privilege of the lord mayor's being elected out of one of them The name by no means implied originally a dealer in silks for  mercery  included all sorts of small wares toys and haberdashery  Anderson's Dict  i  But as numbers of this opulent company were merchants and imported great quantities of rich silks from  Italy  the name became applied to the company and all dealers in silk Several of the portraits in the great room of this hall are of  Italian  merchants Not fewer than sixtytwo mayors were of this company between the years and among which it reckons Sir  John Coventry  Sir  Richard Whittington  and Sir  Richard  and Sir  John Gresham  We are obliged to the exact  Strype  for the list In that by  Maitland  the company each mayor was of is omitted  IMMEDIATELY to the east is the narrow street the  Old Jewry  THE OLD JEWRY  which took its name from the great synagogue which stood there till the unhappy race were expelled the kingdom in Their persecutions under some of the preceding monarchs nearly equalled those of the Christians under the  Roman  emperors yet the love of gain retained them in our country in defiance of all their sufferings A new order of friars called  Fratres de Sacca  or  de penitentia  got possession of the  Jewish  temple but did not hold it long  Robert Fitzwalter  the great bannerbearer of the city requested in that the friars might assign it to him It  seems it joined to his own house which stood near the site of the present  Grocers hall  In it was occupied by  Robert Lorge  mayor who kept his mayoralty in this house Sir  Hugh Clapton  did the same in and after these tenants it was degraded into a tavern distinguished by the sign of the Windmill  GROCERS HALL  THE chapel or church was bought by the Grocers company in from  Fitzwalter  for three hundred and twenty marks  Survaie    who here layed the foundation of the present hall a noble room with a  gothic  front and bow window Here to my great surprize  O SIR JOHN CUTLER  I met again with Sir  John Cutler  knight and grocer in marble and on canvas In the first he is represented standing in a flowing wig waved rather than curled a laced cravat and a furred gown with the folds not ungraceful in all except where the dress is inimical to the sculptor's art it may be called a good performance By his portrait we may learn that this worthy wore a black wig and was a goodlooking man He died in His kinsman and executor  Edmund Boulter  Esq  expended £ on his funeral expences  Strype's Stow  i book i p  I am to learn how his statue and portrait came here He is spoken of as a benefactor and that he built the parlour and over it an entertaining room The anecdote of his bounty to the College of Physicians may lead one to suppose that the Grocers did not meet with more liberal treatment If not the character given of him by Mr  Pope  may rest unimpeached  Thy life more wretched  Cutler  was confess'd  Arise and tell me was thy death more bless'd  Cut  er  saw tenants break and houses fall  For very want he could not build a wall  His only daughter in a stranger's power  He had two daughters one married to Sir  William Portman  bart the other to  John Robartes  earl of  Radnor  both married without his consent The first died before him  J C Brooke  esq  Somersetherald  The same authority tells me he had his grant of arms just before his death wherein he is styled "of the city of  Westminster  "    For very want he could not pay a dower  A few grey hairs his rev'rend temples crown'd  'Twas very want that sold them for ten pound  What ev'n denied a cordial at his end  Banish'd the doctor and expell'd the friend  What but a want which you perhaps think mad  Yet numbers feel the want of what he had  THIS company follows the Mercers they were originally called  Pepperers  from their dealing so greatly in pepper but in they were incorporated by the name of  Grocers  either because they fold things by or dealt in  grossi  or figs  Survaie      But from the beginning they trafficked in all the good things which the trade does to this day  I FORGOT  Bucklesbury  BUCKLESBURY  a street which opens on the south side of  Cheapside  a little to the west of the Grocers hall It took its name from one  Buckle  who had in it a large manourhouse of stone This man lost his life in a strange way Near his house stood an old tower built by  Edward  I called the  Cornets  tower possibly a watch tower from the summit of which signals might have been given by the blowing of a horn This  Buckle  intended to pull down and to have built a handsome house of  wood or according to the expression of the times a  goodly frame of timber  but in greedily demolishing this tower a stone fell on him and crushed him to death and another who married his widow set up the newprepared frame of timber and finished the work This street in  Stow  's time was the residence of grocers and apothecaries  Survaie      THE MANSIONHOUSE  ON the same side of the way is the  Mansionhouse  "damned I may say to everlasting fame  Critical Review c    " The sight is relieved amply by another building behind it St  Stephen's Walbrook  a small church the  chef d'aeuvre  of Sir  Christopher Wren  of most exquisite beauty  Perhaps  Italy  itself says a judicious writer can produce no modern building that can vie with this in taste and proportion there is not a beauty which the plan would admit of that is not to be found here in the greatest perfection and foreigners very justly call our taste in question for understanding the graces no better and allowing it no higher degree of fame  Ibid      OVER the altar is a beautiful picture of the martyrdom of St  Stephen  by Mr  West  The character of the saint is finely expressed in his angelic countenance resigned to his fate and full of sure and certain hope I looked to no purpose for the statue erected DIVAe MACAULAe by her doating admirer a former rector which a successor of his has most profanely pulled down  STOCKSMARKET  THE Mansionhouse and many adjacent buildings stand on the site of  Stocksmarket  which took its name from a pair of  SIR RICHARD CLOUGH K  portrait of Sir Richard Clough  stocks for the punishment of offenders erected in an open place near this spot as early as the year This was the great market of the city during many centuries In it stood the famous equestrian statue erected in honor of  Charles  II by his most loyal subject Sir  Robert Viner  lord mayor Fortunately his lordship discovered at a founder's one of  John Sobieski  king of  Poland  trampling on a Turk the good knight christened the  Polish  monarch by the name of  Charles  and bestowed on the turbaned  Turk  that of  Oliver Cromwel  and thus new named it arose on this spot in honor of his convivial monarch  THE opening before the Mansionhouse divides into three important streets  Cornhill  in the center the Bank of  England  the old  Threadneedlestreet  on the north and  Lombardstreet  on the south I shall pursue these as far as the spots which I have passed over and give the remaining things worthy of notice I shall take the middle way  THE  Royal Exchange  that concourse of all the nations of the world arises before us with the full majesty of commerce  ROYAL EXCHANGE  Whether we consider the grandeur of the edifice or the vast concerns carried on within its walls we are equally struck with its importance But we are more astonished when we find that this expensive princely pile was the effect of the munificence of a private citizen SIR THOMAS GRESHAM Let the pride of my country not be suppressed when I have opportunity of saying that the original hint was given to him by a  Welshman  by  Richard Clough  afterwards knighted originally his servant and in the year by his merit and industry advanced by Sir  Thomas  to be his correspondent and agent in the then emporium of the world  Antwerp Clough  wrote to his master to blame the city of  London  for neglecting so necessary a thing bluntly telling that they studied nothing else but their own private profit that they were content to walk about in the rain more like pedlars than merchants and that there was no kind of people but had their place to transact business in in other countries Thus stimulated Sir  Thomas  purchased some tenements on the site of the Royal Exchange and on  June  laid the foundation and in  November  completed what was then called the  Bourse  In queen  Elizabeth  went in great state from her palace at  Somersethouse  to make Sir  Thomas  a visit at his own house After dinner she went to the Bourse visited every part and then by sound of trumpet dignified it with the title of the  Royal Exchange  All the upper part was filled then and even to this century with shops on this occasion they were filled with the richest productions of the universe to shew her majesty the prosperity of the commercial parts of her dominions I cannot learn what the expence of this noble design was only that the annual product of the rents to his widow was £  s  I am equally unacquainted with the form of the original building which perished in the great fire It was rebuilt in its present magnificent form by the city and the company of mercers  Strype's Stow  i book ii p  at the expence of eighty thousand pounds which for a considerable time involved the undertakers in a large debt It was completed in on  Sept  of that year it was opened by the lord mayor Sir  William Turner  who congratulated the merchants on the occasion  The following inscription does grateful honor to the original founder  HOC GRESHAMII Peristyllium  Gentium commercium sacrum  Flammis extinctum  Augustius e cinere resurrexit  W  ll  Turnero  milite praetore  THE statue of Sir  Thomas Gresham  is in one corner in the dress of the times Another of that worthy citizen Sir  John Barnard  graces another part The rest are kings which as far as king  Charles  with that of Sir  Thomas  were chiefly executed by  Gabriel Cibber  that of  Charles  II in the centre by  Gibbons  Anecdotes of Painting  iii  And above stairs are the statues of  Charles  I and II and another of the illustrious founder by  John Buchnell  an artist of inferior merit in the reign of  William  III On the top of the tower in front of the exchange is a Grasshopper the crest of Sir  Thomas Gresham  The allusion to that and the Dragon on  Bow  steeple makes a line in that inexcusable performance of Dean  Swift  's a profane imitation of the style of the BIBLE  Wonderful Prophecy c  which dulness itself could execute and which nothing but the most indefensible wantonness could have produced from a person of his profession and of his allacknowleged wit  I MUST direct the reader's attention to the beautiful  gothic  tower of St  Michael  's on the south side of  Cornhill  At each corner is an angulated turret as high as the belfry where they  become fluted and the capital ornamented with sculptures of heman faces from them they spire into very elegant pinnacles The body of this church was burnt in the great fire It was begun to be built in  Stow's Survaie  i  but the church was of far greater antiquity It appears to have existed in This church had its pulpitcross like that of St  Paul  's built by Sir  John Rudstone  mayor in who was interred in a vault beneath in It may be added that  Robert Fabian  alderman the celebrated historian was buried in this church in after passing the dignity of sheriff  THE king had a royal residence in this street which was afterwards converted into a noted tavern called the  Pope's head  It was a vast house and in the time of  Stow  distinguished by the arms of  England  at that time three leopards  passant guardant  and two angels the supporters cut on stone  The Same    LEADENHALL  AT the end of  Cornhill  is as it were a continuation of the street by the name of that of  Leadenhall  It takes its name from a large plain building inhabited about the year by Sir  Hugh Nevil  knight in belonging to  Humphry Bohun  earl of  Hereford  In it became the property of the munificent  Whittington  who presented it to the mayor and commonalty of  London  In  PUBLIC GRANARY  Sir  Simon Eyre  citizen and drape  erected here a public granary built with stone in its present form This was to be what the  French  call a  Grenier d'abondance  to be always filled with corn and designed as a preservative against famine The intent was happily answered in distressful seasons This and other o  the city granaries seem at first to have been under the care of the mayors but in  Henry  VIII's time regular surveyors were appointed He also built a chapel within the square this he intended to apply to the uses of a foundation for a warden six secular priests six clerks and two choristers and besides three schoolmasters For this purpose he left three thousand marks to the Drapers company to fulfil his intent This was never executed but in a fraternity of sixty priests some of whom were to perform divine service every marketday to such who frequented the market was founded by three priests  William Rouse John Risby  and  Thomas Ashby  Tanner    LEADENHALLSTREET had the good fortune to escape tolerably well in the great fire The house was used for many other purposes for the keeping the artillery and other arms of the city Preparations for any triumph or pageantry in the city were made here From its strength it was considered as the chief fortress within the city in case of popular tumults and also as the place from which doles largesses or pious alms were to be distributed Here in while  Henry  VIII lay putrefying in state  Heath  bishop of  Winchester  his almoner and others his ministers distributed great sums of money during twelve days to the poor of the city The same was done at  Westminster  Strype's Stow  i book ii p  but I greatly fear his majesty was past ransom The market here was of great antiquity considerable as it is at present it is far inferior to what it has been by reason of the numbers of other markets which have been established Still it is the wonder of foreigners  who do not duly consider the carnivorous nation to which it belongs  THE slaughter made of the horned cattle for the support of the metropolis is evinced by the multitudes of tanned hides exposed to sale in the great court of  Leadenhall  which is the present market for that article  INDIAHOUSE  THE  Indiahouse  stands a little farther to the east but is not worthy of the lords of  Indostan  This was built in on the spot once occupied by Sir  William Craven  mayor in a man of most extensive charity His house was very large the apartments capacious and fit for any public concern  Strype's Stow  i book ii    IN the church of St  Catherine Cree  in this street is supposed to have been interred the celebrated  Holbein  who died of the plague in at the duke of  Norfolk  's in the priory of  Christchurch  near  Aldgate  I must also mention it on another account for its being the stage on which the imprudent wellmeaning  Laud  acted a most superstitious part in its consecration on  January  His whole conduct tended to add new force to the discontents and rage of the times he attempted innovations in the ceremonies of the church at a season he ought at lest to have left them in the state he found them instead of that he pushed things to extremities by that and by his fierce persecutions of his opponents from which he never desisted till he brought destruction on himself and highly contributed to that of his royal master  PRYNNE whom every one must allow to have had sufficient  cause of resentment against the archbishop gives the relation with much acrimony and much prophane humor  In his  Canterbury's Doom  Book ii p    As first  When the bishop approached near the communion table he bowed with his nose very near the ground some six or seven times then he came to one of the corners of the table and there bowed himself three times then to the second third and fourth corners bowing at each corner three times but when he came to the side of the table where the bread and wine was he bowed himself seven times and then after the reading many praiers by himselfe and his two fat chaplins which were with him and all this while were upon their knees by him in their sirplisses hoods and tippits he himself came neare the bread which was cut and laid in a fine napkin and then he gently lifted up one of the corners of the said napkin and peeping into it till he saw the bread like a boy that peeped into a bird's nest in a bush and presently clapped it down againe and flew back a step or two and then bowed very low three times towards it and the table When he beheld the bread then he came near and opened the napkin againe and bowed as before then he laid his hand upon the gilt cup which was full of wine with a cover upon it so soon as he had pulled the cupp a little neerer to him he lett the cupp goe flew backe and bowed againe three times towards it then hee came neere againe and lifting up the cover of the cupp peeped into it and seeing the wine he let fall the cover on it againe and flew nimbly backe and bowed as before After these and many other apish anticke gestures he himselfe  received and then gave the sacrament to some principal men onely they devoutly kneeling neere the table after which more praiers being said this scene and interlude ended  To the west of St  Catherine Cree  in the same street stands the church of St  Andrew Undershaft  from the unfortunate shaft or  maypole  which on  May  st gave rise to the insurrection of the apprentices and the plundering of the foreigners in the city whence it got the name of  Evil Mayday  Herbert's Henry  VIII  Stow's Survaie    From that time it was hung on a range of hooks over the doors of a long row of neighbouring houses In the third of  Edward  VI when the plague of fanaticism began to scandalize the promoters of the Reformed religion an ignorant wretch called  Sir Stephen  curate of St  Catherine Cree  began to preach against this  maypole  notwithstanding it had hung in peace ever since the  Evil Mayday  as an idol by naming the church St  Andrew  with the addition of  Shaft  This inflamed his audience so greatly that after eating a hearty dinner to strengthen themselves every owner of such house over which the shaft hung with assistance of others fawed off as much of it as hung over his premises each took his share and committed to the flames the tremendous idol This  Sir Stephen  scorning the use of the sober pulpit sometimes mounted on a tomb with his back to the altar to pour out his nonsensical rhapsodies at other times he climbed into a lofty elm in the churchyard and bestriding a bough delivered out his cant with double effect merely by reason of the novelty of the situation  Stow's Survaie      IN the church of St  Andrew Undershaft  was interred the faithful and able historian of the city  John Stow  He died in aged and to the shame of his time in much poverty His monument is still in being a wellexecuted figure sitting at a desk in a furred gown and writing The figure is said to be made of  terra cotta  or burnt earth painted a common practice in those days possibly somewhat similar to the artificial stone of our time  IN  Limestreet  the northern end of which opens into that of  Leadenha    stood the house and chapel of the lord  Nevil  and after him of the accomplished Sir  Simon de Burley  SIR SIMON DE BURLEY'S HOUSE  and of his brother Sir  John  In the time of  Stow  it was partly taken down and new fronted with timber by  Hugh Offley  alderman Finally not far from hence towards the end of the adjacent street of St  MaryAx

properly  Threeneedle Street  BANK OF ENGLAND  That noble building the  Bank  of  England  fills one side of the space The center and the building behind were founded in the year the architect  George Sampson  Before that time the business was carried on in  Grocers Hall  The front is a sort of vestibule the base rustic the ornamental columns above Ionic Within is a court leading to a second elegant building which contains a hall and offices where the debt of above two hundred and  fifty millions is punctually discharged Of late years two wings of uncommon elegance designed by Sir  Robert Taylor  have been added at the expence of a few houses and of the church of St  Christopher's le Stocks  The demolition of the last occasioned as much injury to the memorials of the dead and disturbance of their poor ashes as ever the impiety of the fanatics did in the last century Much of my kindred dust  Strype's Annals  ii  was violated among others those of the  Houblon  family sprung

the year he made vast collections as well for the history and topography of his native city as for the history of  England  Numbers of facts in the interesting period in which he lived he speaks of from his own knowlege or of earlier matters from books long since lost Multitudes of the houses of our antient nobility existing in his time are mentioned by him and many of them in the most despicable parts of the town  BENJAMIN ROBINS  THE late  Benjamin Robins  was the son of a taylor at  Bath  He united the powers of the sword and the pen His knowlege in tactics was equal to that of any person of his age and by his compilation of lord  Anson  's voyage he proved himself not inferior in elegance of style  ROBERT HILL  ROBERT HILL taylor of  Buckingham  was the first  Hebraean  of his time a knowlege acquired in the most pressing poverty and the cares of his profession to maintain for a most excellent man he was his large family The Reverend Mr  Spence  did not think it beneath him to write his life and point him out to the public as a meritorious object of charity and to form a parallel  between him and the celebrated  Magliabecchi  librarian to the great duke of  Tuscany  This little tract was written in and is reprinted among the Fugitive Pieces in the d volume  Hill  was born in    IT was one of this meek profession actuated by the religion of meekness who first suggested the pious project of abolishing the slave trade  Thomas Woolman  a quaker and taylor of  New Jersey  was first struck with the thought that engaging in the traffic of the human species was incompatible with the spirit of the Christian religion He published many tracts against this unhappy species of commerce he argued against it in public and private he made long journies for the sake of talking to individuals on the subject and was careful himself not to countenance slavery by the use of those conveniences which were provided by the labor of slaves In the course of a visit to  England  he went to  York  in the same year sickened of the smallpox and died  October  th in sure and certain hopes of that reward which Heaven will bestow on the sincere philanthropist  In this street also stands the  SouthSea house  SOUTHSEA HOUSE  the place in which the company did business when it had any to transact It was first established in for the purpose of an exclusive trade to the  SouthSeas  and for the supplying  Spanish America  with negroes In the year by the villainy of the directors it became the most notorious bubble ever heard of in any kingdom Imaginary fortunes of millions were grasped at a luxury introduced as great as if these schemes had been realized At length the deception was discovered and the iniquitous contrivers detected and brought to punishment many with infamy by being expelled the house  Proceedings of the House of Commons c vi    others suffered in their purses  Proceedings of the House of Commons c vi  but none in a manner adequate to their crimes which brought utter ruin on thousands  AMONG the multitude of bubbles which knaves encouraged by the folly of the times were encouraged to set up were the following most laughable  Insurance against Divorces  A scheme to learn men to cast nativities  Making Dealboards of Sawdust  Making Butter from Beech trees  A flying Engine now exemplified in Balloons  A sweet way of emptying Necessaries  DRAPERS HALL  I RETURN through  Threadneedlestreet  into the  Broad street  In  Throgmortonstreet  near its junction with  Broadstreet  stands  Drapers Hall Thomas Cromwel  earl of  Essex  built a magnificent house on its site he shewed very little scruples in invading the rights of his neighbors to enlarge his domain  Stow  mentions his own father as a sufferer for the earl arbitrarily loosened from its place a house which stood in  Stow  's garden placed it on rollers and had it carried twentytwo feet farther off without giving the least notice and no one dared to complain  Survaie    The manner of removing this house shews what miserable tenements a certain rank of people had which could like the houses in  Moscow  be so easily conveyed from place to place After  Cromwel  's fall the house and gardens were bought by the Drapers company The house was destroyed in the great fire but rebuilt for the use  of their company in a magnificent manner This was the farthest limits of the fire northward as  Allhallows  church in  Fenchurchstreet  was to the east  IN the hall a very elegant room is a portrait of the first mayor  PORTRAITS  of  London Fitzalwin  a half length I need not say a fictitious likeness In his days I doubt whether the artists equalled in any degree the worst of our modern signpainters  AT one end of the room is a large picture of  Mary Stuart  with her hand upon her son  James  I a little boy in a rich vest her dress is black her hair lightcolored I never saw her but in dark hair perhaps she varied her locks This could not be drawn from the life for she never saw her son after he was a year old These portraits are engraven by  Bartolozzi  PORTRAITS of Sir  Joseph Sheldon  mayor in and of Sir  Robert Clayton  mayor in Sir  Robert  was well deserving of this public proof of esteem a great benefactor to  Christchurch  hospital and again to that of St  Thomas  in  Southwark  He is finely painted seated in a chair  THE Drapers were incorporated in The art of weaving woollen cloth was only introduced in by the  Dutch  and  Flemings  but as it was long permitted to export our wool and receive it again manufactured into cloth the cloth trade made little progress in  England  till the reign of queen  Elizabeth  Anderson  i  who may be said to have been the foundress of the wealthy loom as of many other good things in this kingdom  ON the west side of the adjacent  Broadstreet  stood the house of the  Augustines  AUGUSTINES  founded in by  Humphry Bohun  earl of  Hereford  for friars heremites of that order The church falling into ruin was rebuilt by  Humphry  one of his descendants earl of  Hereford  who was buried here in Numbers of persons of rank were also interred here from the opinion of the peculiar sanctity those mendicants filled this earth with Here lay  Edmund Guy de Meric  earl of  St Paul  This nobleman was sent over by  Charles  VI of  France  on a complimentary visit to  Richard  II and his queen He insinuated himself so gready into the king's favor as to become a chief confident insomuch that by the advice of  St Paul  he was guilty of that violent action the murder of his factious uncle the duke of  Glocester  Kennet  i    Lucie  wife of  Edmund Holland  lord admiral and one of the heirs and daughter of  Barnaby  lord of  Milan  She left great legacies to the church in particular to the canons of our lady  de la Scala  at  Milan  RICHARD FITZALAN the great earl of  Arundel  beheaded in at  Tower Hill John Vere  earl of  Oxford  a strong friend to the house of  Lancaster  beheaded by the cruel  Edward  in at the same place with his son and several others Numbers also of the barons who fell in  Barnetfield  found here a place of interment  Edward Stafford  duke of  Buckingham  victim in to the pride of cardinal  Wolsey  chose this holy ground as did multitudes of others recorded in the  Survaie  of  John Stow  P    IN the successful cruizes made by the  English  in the year about three hundred  French  ships were taken  Henry  converted the conventual churches into so many warehouses for the cargoes  This and the  Blackfriars  he filled with herrings and other fish and the  Greyfriars  were filled with wine  Holinshed      AT the dissolution great part of the house cloisters  WINCHESTERHOUSE  and gardens were granted to  William  lord  St John  afterwards marquis of  Winchester  and lord treasurer On the site he built  Winchesterplace  a magnificent house where  Winchesterstreet  now stands The west end of the church was in granted to  John a Lasco  for the use of the  Germans  and other fugitive Protestants and afterwards to the  Dutch  as a preachingplace Part also was converted into a glasshouse for  Venice  glass in which  Venetians  were employed in every branch of this manufacture They were patronized by the duke of  Buckingham Howel  the celebrated author of the Letters was steward to the manufacture but was obliged to quit his office not being able to endure the heat He had been at  Venice  in  Howel's Letters    probably to pry into the secrets of the art and to engage workmen This place was afterwards converted into  Pinnershall  or the hall of the company of Pinmakers  THE other part the marquis reserved for the purpose of stowing corn coal and other things His son sold the noble monuments of the dead the pavingstones and many other materials which had cost thousands for a hundred pounds and converted the building into stables for his horses  Kennet  i  The steeple was standing in the year It was so beautiful that the mayor and several respectable citizens petitioned the marquis that it might not be  pulled down but their petition was rejected and this fine ornament of the city demolished  Strype's Stow  i book ii p    BEHIND this church close to  London wall  stood the  Papey  a fraternity of St  Charilibis  and St  John  the  evangelist  for  Papeys  or poor infirm priests founded in by certain chauntry priests It was a numerous society designed to relieve any of its members who by lameness or illness were reduced to distress or poverty whether they were brothers or sisters The church of St  Augustine Papey  belonged to this fraternity These priests the brotherhood of threescore priests of  Leadenhall  and the company of parish clerks who were skilled in singing  diriges  and funeral office were accustomed to attend the solemn burials of the rich or great These are frequently represented on the sides of antient tombs and were called  pleureurs weepers  and  mourners  This house became after the suppression the habitation of Sir  Francis Walsingham  IN  Winchesterstreet  stood also a great house called the  Spanish  ambassador's which was occupied by Sir  James Houblon  knight and alderman and at the same period it was the residence of several of our most eminent merchants  SIR THOMAS GRESHAM'S HOUSE  TO the east side of the same street stood the house of our first of merchants Sir  Thomas Gresham  originally built with brick and timber and fronting to  Bishopsgatestreet  By his will he appointed four lecturers in divinity astronomy music and geometry and three readers in civil law physic and rhetoric each with a salary of fifty pounds a year payable out of the rent issuing out of the Royal Exchange This house was the place where the professors  had their apartments and where the lectures were to be read which were begun in but they are now quite deserted This arose in a great degree from the institution of the ROYAL SOCIETY the meetings of which were for a considerable time held here  THE origin of that respectable body was from the meeting of a few illustrious persons at the lodgings of doctor  Wilkins  ORIGIN OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY  afterwards bishop of  Chester  and others worthy of record doctor  Seth Ward  afterwards bishop of  Salisbury  Mr BOYLE Sir  William Petty  and the doctors  Wallis Goddard Willis  and  Bathurst  Sir  Christopher Wren  and a few more In they assembled in  Gresham  college by permission of the professors of the foundation of Sir  Thomas Gresham  and on the Restoration were incorporated by royal charter A most instructive and wellfounded Museum was established here in by  Henry Colwall  ITS MUSEUM  consisting of natural and artificial curiosities collected with great expence and judgment The society had a benefit never known at any other time the assistance of the great Mr BOYLE the most accomplished most learned and most religious virtuoso who pointed out the proper objects of their collection and gave them the most finished instructions  These were collected and published in This little book is a most necessary companion for all travellers and voyagers  for procuring them from every quarter of the globe At that period there were in both the  Indies  persons capable of understanding and pursuing with success the plan laid down for them at home It was the good fortune of the  Museum  to have coexistent with its formation a philosopher  for its Curator fully qualified to describe its various articles Doctor  Nehemiah Grew  not only performed that part but illustrated every one in cases where the subject admitted with the most learned and pertinent remarks He published his  Museum Regalis Societatis  in and dedicated it to the founder Mr  Colwall  at the expence of whom the plates were engraven It is a work equal to the  Museum Wormianum  and any other admired foreign performance of that age Its defects arise only from the want of system the misfortune of the time for our RAY had not then cleared the rich ore of Natural History from the surrounding rubbish About the year the Society removed from hence to  Cranecourt  in  Fleetstreet  For numbers of years the  Museum  was neglected My respected friend the honourable  Daines Barrington  with most disinterested zeal undertook the restoring it as far as the ravages of time would permit This he did in the most effectual manner and enriched it with a number of new specimens especially from our late colonies it being his design to have formed it into a repository of every thing relative to the natural history of  Great Britain  and its dependencies a most noble plan and worthy of being carried into full execution By singular chance  Gresham  college escaped the flames in but I believe very little of the original house remains it having been mostly rebuilt in possibly after the original design the arcades being adapted for the reception of the numbers of commercial and other followers of so universal a merchant as Sir  Thomas Gresham  EXCISEOFFICE  THIS college has been pulled down within my memory and the  Exciseoffice  a building of most magnificent simplicity has  rose in its place The payment into this office from the th of  January  to the th of  January  was not less than five millions five hundred and thirtyone thousand one hundred and fourteen pounds six shillings and ten pence halfpenny Happy for us that our wealth keeps pace with our luxury  THE house known by the name of  Crosbiehouse  CROSBIEHOUSE  stood on the opposite side of  Bishopsgatestreet  and was another magnificent structure built by Sir  John Crosbie  sheriff in on ground leased to him by  Alice Ashfield  prioress of St  Helen's  In this house  Richard  duke of  Glocester  lodged  Fabian  book vii  after he had conveyed his nephews to the Tower and was meditating the destruction of the poor innocents The hall miscalled  Richard  III's chapel is still very entire a beautiful  gothic  building with a bowwindow on one side the roof is timber and much to be admired At present this magnificent room is occupied by a packer  HENRY VIII made a grant of it to  Anthonio Bonvica  a rich  Italian  merchant  Stow  ii book ii    Henry  was a great favorer of the merchants of this nation for the sake of the  magnificent silks velvets tissues of gold jewels and other luxuries as he expresses it for

the ambassador of  Denmark  Stow's Survaie    The site of this house is still known by the name of  Crosbiesquare  THE house of that great merchant Sir  Paul Pindar  stands in this street it is easily known by the bow and vast extent of windows along the front Sir  Paul  was early distinguished by that frequent cause of promotion the knowlege of languages He was put apprentice to an  Italian  master travelled much and was appointed ambassador to the  Grand Seignor  by  James  I in which office he gained great credit by extending the  English  commerce in the  Turkish  dominions He brought over with him a diamond valued at £ the king wished to buy it on credit but this the sensible merchant declined but favored his majesty with the loan on  gala  days his unfortunate son became the purchaser Sir  Paul  was appointed farmer of the customs by  James  and frequently supplied that monarch's wants as well as those of his successor He was esteemed at one time worth £ exclusive of bad debts in the year His charities were very great he expended nineteen thousand pounds in the repairs of  St Paul's  cathedral  Whitelock  p  He was ruined by his connections with his unfortunate monarch and if I remember right underwent imprisonment for debt It is said that  Charles  owed him and the rest of the old commissioners of the customs £ for the security of which in they offered the parlement £ but the proposal was rejected  Whitelock  p In the  Gentleman's Magazine  for  June  is an ample account of Sir  Paul Pindar  and in the  European  for  April  his character with a view of his house  He died  August  aged He left his affairs in such a perplexed state that his executor  William Toomes  unable to bear the disappointment destroyed  himself and most deservedly underwent the ignominy of the now almost obsolete verdict of  Felo de se  HELENA the mother of  Constantine  the Great  PRIORY OF ST HELEN'S OR ST HELEN'S THE LESS  and a canonized saint had a little to the east of  Crosbiesquare  a church dedicated to her in very early times In a priory of  Benedictine  nuns was founded by a goldsmith  William FitzWilliam  dedicated to the  Holy Cross  and its inventress  Helena  the  piissima et venerabilis  AUGUSTA Its revenues according to  Dugdale  were £  s    d Henry  granted the site to Mr  Richard Cromwel  alias  Williams  and on the nuns hall was built the  Leathersellers Hall  This company was incorporated in the reign of  Richard  II They flourished greatly in particular in the time of queen  Elizabeth  when they had considerable commerce in skins from  Barbary  and  Russia  and made great profits from the exportation of the manufactured leather  NORTHEAST of  Threadneedlestreet  CHURCH OF ST HELEN'S THE GREAT  stands the antient church known by the name of  St Helen's the Great  in it are numbers of curious tombs they fortunately escaped the ravages of the great fire That of the great benefactor to the city Sir  Thomas Gresham  TOMB OF SIR T GRESHAM  claims the first notice it is altarfashioned with a black slab on the top the sides fluted and of coloured marble So great a name wanted not the proclamation of an epitaph so it is entirely

Adelmar Cesar  who died a superannuated master of the Rolls in is very singular His epitaph is cut on a black slab in form of a piece of parchment with a seal appendant by which he gives his bond to Heaven to resign his life willingly whenever it should please GOD to call him  In cujus rei testimonium manum meam et sigillum apposui  RICHARD BANCROFT  IN a plain square mausoleum is lodged the embalmed corpse of  Richard Bancroft  placed in a chest with a lid fastened only with hinges and over the face is a glass pane This  Bancroft  is said to have been one of the lord mayor's officers and a very rapacious person To make atonement for his past life he left his illgotten riches in trust to found and maintain an almshouse and  Hall in Crosbie Place  school and to keep the monument in repair He left twenty shillings to the minister to preach annually a commemorationsermon  Northouk's Hist of London    The almsmen and scholars attended and his body was brought out for public inspection But I think that this custom as well as the sermon have been of late years laid aside  HERE is also another tomb seemingly belonging to some persons of rank it is of an altar form on it lie recumbent two alabaster figures one of a beardless man with his hair cut short and round over his shoulders is a robe a fine collar round his neck his body armed and a griffin at his feet By him lies

 Italy  into our kingdom before the year  Anderson  i  at length their extortions became so great that  Edward  III seized on their estates perhaps the necessity of furnishing him with money for his  Flemish  expedition might have urged him to this step They seem quickly to have repaired their loss for complaint was soon after made against them for persisting in their practices They were so opulent in the days of  Henry  VI as to be able to furnish him with money but they took care to get the customs mortgaged to them by way of security  The same  In this street they continued till the reign of queen  Elizabeth  and to this day it is filled with the shops of numbers of eminent bankers  THE shop of the great Sir  Thomas Gresham  stood in this street it is now held by Messrs  Martin  bankers who are still in possession of the original sign of that illustrious person the  Grasshopper  Was it mine that honorable memorial of so great a predecessor should certainly receive the most ostentatious situation I could find  POSTOFFICE  THE  Postoffice  which gives wings to the extension of commerce stands in  Lombardstreet  The office of chief postmaster was erected in  The  Asterisks  mark my authority as from Mr  Anderson  the rest are more doubtful except from the words  net income  in the next page  but we are not told how this branch of business was managed however it was not regularly established till the year when Mr  Edmund Prideaux  the inland postmaster was supposed to collect about five thousand pounds a year  IN the parlement farmed the postoffice to a Mr  Manly  for £ This farm included the postage of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  The  Asterisks  mark my authority as from Mr  Anderson  the rest are more doubtful except from the words  net income  in the

convivial Sir  Robert Viner  replaced it with a large house for his own habitation Sir  Robert  during his mayoralty in was honored with the presence of his monarch  Charles  II his  majesty was for retiring after staying the usual time but Sir  Robert  filled with good liquor and loyalty laid hold of the king and swore  Sir you shall take t'other bottle The airy monarch looked kindly at him over the shoulder and with a smile and graceful air repeated this line of the old song  "He that's drunk is as great as a king"  and immediately turned back and complied with his landlord  Spectator  N  o      IN the same street towards  Birchin Lane  stood the house of  William de la Pole  Stow's Survaie    created in  France  by  Edward  III knightbanneret with allowance out of the customs of  Hull  for the support of his dignity  Vincent's Discoverie  c  He was a great merchant and being very opulent used to supply the king's pecuniary wants He was at the same time the  King's merchant  an office that gave him the lucrative privilege of supplying his master with different sorts of merchandize and also with money The office seems to have been continued to later days under another name  Henry  VIII had his  King's factor  and Sir  Thomas Gresham  bore the title of the  Queen's Richard William's  elder brother a merchant at  Hull  had the same employ under  Edward  III who calls him  dilectus mercator Ricardus de la Pole Pincerna noster  The same    FROM  William  sprung a numerous race of nobility distinguished by their ambition and unfortunate ends His son  Michael  was created earl of  Suffolk  yet continued in his office of  King's merchant  and lived in his father's house  Stow's Survaie    He at length became lord high chancellor but being accused of embezzling the public money and divers other crimes was banished the kingdom and died at  Paris  in of a broken heart His son  Michael  was restored and died of a flux at the siege of  Harfleur  in  Sept  and in the very following month his son and successor another  Michael  fell in the battle of  Agincourt  His brother  William  succeeded and was afterwards created marquis and then duke of  Suffolk  He was the favorite of the spirited  Margaret  of  Anjou  He was of distinguished abilities but by his insolence enraged the nobility so greatly that on an accusation of his being the cause of the loss of  France  they banished him the kingdom On his passage to  Calais  he was seized by a vessel sent expressly to intercept him and was brought into  Dover  beheaded by the captain of the ship in the cockboat without ceremony and his body flung upon the sands where it was found by his chaplain and buried at  Wingfield  in  Suffolk  The nobility dreaded his return therefore took this method to free themselves from so formidable an enemy  See the curious particulars in Sir  John Fenn  's i truly stated See also  Shakespeare's Henry  VI part ii act iv scene and the account of the prophecy in act in i scene    John  his son succeeded him Finally his son  Edmund  who was condemned for a murder in the time of  Henry  VII received his pardon but in the following reign was in executed for treason but his chief crime with that tyrant seems his relation to the house of  York  his mother being sister to  Edward  IV The venerable  Margaret  countess of  Salisbury  was barbarously brought to the block for the same reason her son cardinal  Pole  would not have been spared could  Henry  have got him into his power  Henry Pole  lord  Montacute  suffered for corresponding with him and thus ended this illfated race  DENMARKHOUSE  In  Fenchurchstreet  a continuation of the former stood  Denmarkhouse  In it was lodged the ambassador sent in as  Holinshed  expresses it from the emperor of  Cathaie Muscovia  and  Russeland  This was in consequence of the new discovery of the  White Sea  by  Chancellor  for till that time  Russia  was quite impervious by any other way The merchants were well acquainted with the importance of the new commerce they met him at  Tottenham  with all the splendor that was likely to make an impression on the mind of a  Barbarian  They were dressed in velvet coats and rich chains of gold and bore all his expences Lord  Montacute  with the queen's pensioners met him at  Islington  and the lord mayor and aldermen in scarlet robes received him at  Smithfield  and from thence rode with him to this house then "Maister  Dimmock's  in  Fenchurch Street  Holinshed    " Our  Russian  company was formed three years previous to the arrival of this ambassador but its commerce was carried on with redoubled success after the  Russians  were thus made acquainted with our wealth and power  HUDSON'SBAY HOUSE  IN this street is the  Hudson'sbay House  the vast repository of the northern furs of  America  which are lodged here till they are sold and exported to various parts of the world even to the distant  China  In this hall is a vast pair of horns of the  Moose Deer  weighing fiftysix pounds and in another room the picture of an  Elk  the  European Morse  killed in the presence of  Charles  XI of  Sweden  which weighed twelve hundred and twentynine pounds  I SHOULD speak with the prejudices of a true  Englishman  was I to dignify the  Thames  with the title of the chief of rivers I must qualify my patriotism with its just clame to that of first of islandrivers But in respect to our rival kingdom it must yield the palm to the  Garonne  only we must not make comparison of length of course The contracted space of our island must limit that species of grandeur but there are none in any part of  Europe  which can boast of more utility in bringing farther from the ocean the largest commercial ships nor are there any which can bring the riches of the universe to their very capital The ships of the  Seine  discharge themselves at  Havre  those of the  Loire  reach no farther than  PortLannai  far below its  emporium Nantes  and the  Garonne  conveys no farther than  Pouillac  the fullloaden ships there they are obliged to be eased of part of their cargoes before they can reach the opulent  Bourdeaux  THE  Thames  rises beneath  Suffertonhill  just within the borders of  Glocestershire  a little to the southwest of  Cirencester  which it instantly quits and enters for a short space into the county of  Wilts  bends a little into it and reenters its parent province near  Lechlade  where by means of locks it first becomes navigable and as is said for barges of seventy tons It here leaves  Glocestershire  and becomes the whole southern boundary of  Oxfordshire  or the northern of  Berkshire  and from thence is the southe  n limit of  Buckinghamshire  At  Great Marlow  in that  county is the last lock from thence to the sea it requires no farther an to aid its navigation At a small distance from  Windsor  it divides  Middlesex  from  Surry  just above  Kingston  it feels the last feeble efforts of a tide  TIDE  from thence is a most important increase just below  Londonbridge  eighteen feet and at  Deptford  twenty The preceding brings ships of three hundred and fifty tons drawing sixteen feet water to the customhouse the last those of a thousand tons even the largest drawing twentythree feet which import the treasures of  India  This noble river continues fresh as low as  Woolwich  WHERE BRACKISH  and even there is brackish only at springtides Thus at our capital it is perfectly pure salubrious and subservient to vast articles of commerce with which that stupendous city abounds  LENGTH  THE whole course of the  Thames  to its mouth is considerably above two hundred miles I contract its length very considerably in comparison of the usual estimation  ITS PROPER MOUTH  for I limit its mouth to the spot between the west end of the isle of  Grain  in  Kent  and the eastern part of that of  Canvey  in  Essex  From those plates to the  Naze  in the latter county and the  North Foreland  in that of  Kent  which have hitherto been considered as its entrance it ceases to flow in a single channel it becomes a vast estuary filled with sandbanks many of which appear above water at the recess of the tides  THE whole course of the river is through a country which furnishes every idea of opulence fertility and rural elegance meadows rich in hay or covered with numerous herds gentle risings and hanging woods embellished with palaces magnificent seats  or beautiful villas a few the hereditary mansions of our antient gentry but the greater part property transferred by the effects of vice and dissipation to the owners of honest wealth acquired by commerce or industrious professions or the dear purchase of cankering rapine Its course furnishes few sublime scenes excepting the high chalky cliffs near  Henley  all its banks are replete with native softness improved by art and the fullest cultivation  I DO not recollect that it flows in any part over a rocky channel its bottom is either gravelly or clayey according to the nature of the soil through which it meanders This gives growth to the abundance of weeds with which it is in many parts filled and these prove the safety of multitudes of fishes  FISH  and preserve them from being extirpated by the unbridled ravages of the poachers The  Thames  has between its source and  Woolwich  every species found in the  British  rivers except the BURBOT the LOCHE the COBITIS TAENIA or SPINY LOCHE of late years discovered in the river  Trent  and the small species of SALMON the SAMLET The SALMON and the SHAD are fishes of passage the first appears in the river about the middle of  February  is in great estimation and sells at a vast price their capture is prohibited from the th of  August  to the th of  November  The SHAD arrives the latter end of  May  or beginning of  June  and is a very coarse fish it sometimes grows to the weight of eight pounds but the usual size is from four to five This is the fish which  Du Hamel  describes as the true  Alose  of the  French  Du Hamel  ii tab i fig  but the fishermen of the  Thames  have another they call  Allis  much lesser than the  former with a row of spots from the gills along the sides just beneath the back more or less in number this the  French  call  Le Feinte  Du Hamel  ii tab i fig  Bloche  ii tab xxx gives the figure of the  Feinte  but is of opinion that the spots vanish with age For my part I have not had opportunities of frequent examination of these fishes but I incline to think they are different as the  Feintes  appear in spawn at the length of sixteen inches which is their largest size  I suspect that the name  Allis  is misapplied to this species and that it ought to be applied to the great or common  Shad  being an evident corruption from the  French  name  Alose  is the same with that of the  Severn  but is rarely taken here but neither of them are admitted to good tables  L  E  LAMPREY ITS  T USE  THE lesser  Lamprey  the  Petromyzon fluviatilis  of LINNAEUS is a small fish of great and national importance and is taken in amazing quantities between  Battersea Reach  and  Taplow Mills  a space of about fifty miles and sold to the  Dutch  for the  Cod  and other fisheries have been sold in one season for that purpose the price has been forty shillings the thousand this year the  Dutch  have given three pounds and the  English  from five to eight pounds the former having prudently contracted for three years at a certain price Formerly the  Thames  has furnished from a million to twelve hundred thousand annuallyAn attempt was lately made in parlement to fling the  Turbot  fishery entirely into  British  hands  OF THE TURBOT FISHERY  by laying ten shillings a ton duty on every foreign vessel importing  Turbots  into  Great Britain  but the plan was found to be derived from selfish motives and even on national injustice the far greater quantity of  Turbots  being discovered to be taken on the coasts of  Holland  and  Flanders  See Supplement to the  Arctic Z  ology    THE fish of the  Thames  which come as low as  London  and beyond it as far as the water is fresh are the  Barbel  which is never seen below the bridge a few  Roach  and  Dace Bleak  in great plenty and  Eels  extend far down the river small  Flounders  are found as far as  Fulham  brought up by the tides and continue stationary  I WILL conclude this account with the fine lines written by Sir  John Denham  on this our celebrated river and in a manner worthy of the greatness of the subject  MY eye descending from the hill surveys  Where THAMES among the wanton valleys strays  THAMES the most lov'd of all the ocean's sons  By his old fire to his embraces runs  Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea  Like mortal life to meet eternity  Tho' with those streams he no resemblance hold  Whose foam is amber and their gravel gold  His genuine and less guilty wealth t' explore  Search not his bottom but survey his shore  O'er which he kindly spreads his spacious wing  And hatches plenty for th' ensuing spring  Nor then destroys it with too fond a stay  Like mothers which their infants overlay  Nor with a sudden and impetuous wave  Like profuse kings resumes the wealth he gave  No unexpected inundations spoil  The mower's hopes nor mock the plowman's toil  But godlike his unwearied bounty flows  First loves to do then loves the good he does  Nor are his blessings to his banks confin'd  But free and common as the sea or wind  When he to boast or to disperse his stores  Full of the tributes of his grateful shores  Visits the world and in his flying tow'rs  Brings home to us and makes both  Indies  ours  Finds wealth where 'tis bestows it where it wants  Cities in deserts woods in cities plants  So that to us nothing no place is strange  While his fair bosom is the world's exchange  O could I flow like thee and make thy stream  My great example as it is my theme  Tho' deep yet clear tho' gentle yet not dull  Strong without rage without o'erflowing full  Heav'n her  Eridanus  no more shall boast  Whose fame in thine like lesser currents lost  APPENDIX  PAGE  BEDFORDROW in this neighborhood  BEDFORDROW  took its name from the uses to which those lands and others adjacent were bequeathed by Sir  William Harpur  son of  William Harpur  of  Bedford  viz to found a free and perpetual school in that his native place for portioning poor maidens for supporting poor children and for maintaining the poor with the surplus all of them inhabitants of the said town Part of the lands were of his own inheritance part belonging to the  Chartreux  at that time lately dissolved Some of the lands were lost others granted to Sir  Thomas Fisher  baronet for other lands belonging to him the remainder granted in the year upon lease by the corporation of  Bedford  trustees to the charity for the purposes of building for the term of fortyone years at the yearly rent of ninetynine years and in the reversion to  Nicholas Barbon  D D for the further term of fiftyone years at the rent of a hundred and fifty on the expiration of the first lease  Bedfordstreet Bedfordrow  and  court Princesstreet Theobald'srow Northstreet Eaststreet Lamb'sconduitstreet Queenstreet Eaglestreet Boswelcourt  and several other streets rose in consequence by which the rents were most considerably increased A suit arose about the year between the warden and fellows of  New College  and the corporation of  Bedford  concerning the right of appointing the masters to the school and their salaries The same was decided in in favor of the college and that the corporation was to pay the head master  thirty pounds a year and the usher twenty and the other charities to be paid proportionably to the revenues of the estate  ON the expiration of the two leases in the annual revenues arising from the rents were found to amount to £  s  and the houses at will to £ And it was found that improvements might be made which would increase the revenue so far as to make the whole amount to £ a year In fact in they did amount to £  s  AMONG other regulations in consequence of the increased revenue by an act made about the year new houses were directed to be built for the schoolmaster usher and writingmaster The headmaster's salary to be augmented to £ per ann the usher's to £ the writingmaster's to £ Towards the portioning of the poor maidens £ was to be annually given £ to be annually given towards apprenticing poor children And I might add several other particulars which I omit as not relative to the city the subject of these sheets  PAGE  PARAPHRASE of the th PSALM alluding to the captivity and illtreatment of the  Welsh  Bards by king  Edward  I Vide  E Evans  SAD near the willowy  Thames  we stood  And curs'd th' inhospitable flood  Tears such as Patriots weep 'gan flow  The silent eloquence of woe  When  Cambria  rush'd into our mind  And pity with just vengeance join'd  Vengeance to injur'd  Cambria  due  And pity O ye Bards to you  Silent neglected and unstrung  Our harps upon the willows hung  That "softly sweet in  Cambrian  measures  "Us'd to sooth our souls to pleasures"  When lo th' insulting soe appears  And bids us dry our useless tears  "Resume your harps" the  Saxons  cry  "And change your grief to songs of joy  "Such as old  Taliessin  sang  "What time your native mountains rang  "With his rude strains and all around  "Seas rivers woods return'd the sound"  What shall the  Saxons  hear us sing  With  Cambrian  strains your vallies ring  Nolet old  Conwy  cease to flow  Back to her source  Sabrina  go  Let huge  Plin  mmon  hide his head  Or let the tyrant strike me dead  If I attempt to sing a song  Unmindful of my country's wrong  What shall an haughty king command  A  Cambrian  hymn in a strange land  May my right hand first wither'd be  Or e'er I touch a string for thee  Proud monarch nay may instant death  Arrest my tongue and stop my breath  If I attempt to sing a song  Unmindful of my country's wrong  Thou God of vengeance dost thou sleep  When thy insulted  Druids  weep  The victors' jest the  Saxons'  scorn  Unheard unpity'd and forlorn  Bare thy red arm thou God of ire  And set their boasted TOWER on fire  Remember our inhuman foes  When the first  Edward  furious rose  And like a whirlwind's rapid sway  Swept armies cities bards away  High on a rock o'er  Conwy  's flood  The last surviving poet stood  And curs'd the tyrant as he pass'd  With cruel pomp and murd'rous haste  What now avail our tuneful strains  'Midst savage taunts and biting chains  Say will the lark imprison'd sing  So sweet as when on tow'ring wing  He wakes the songsters of the sky  And tunes his notes to liberty  Ah no the  Cambrian  lyre no more  Shall sweetly sound on  Arvon  's shore  No more the SILVER HARP be won  Ye Muses by your favorite son  Or I ev'n I by glory fir'd  Had to the honor'd prize aspir'd  No more shall  Mona  's oaks be spar'd  Nor  Druids'  circle be rever'd  On  Conwy  's banks and  Menai  's streams  The solitary bittern screams  Where  Lewellyn  kept his court  Wolves and illomen'd birds resort  There oft' at midnight's silent hour  Near yon ivymantled tow'r  By the glowworm's yellow fire  Tuning his romantic lyre  Gray  's pale spectre seems to sing  "RUIN SEIZE THEE RUTHLESS KING"  A GENERAL BILL of all the CHRISTNINGS and
