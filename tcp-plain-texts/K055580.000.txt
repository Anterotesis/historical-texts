Situation rendering it impossible for him to perform the smaller Pieces of his own Writing as often as the PUBLIC would desire them thought that a SINGING FARCE though pretending to no other Merit

ACT I  SCENE I  A Garden belonging to the  CADI  's house On the curtain's rising the  CADI  appears seated crosslegg'd in a sort of pavilion He is smoking a long pipe On either side of him sit his wife  FATIMA  and his daughter  ZORAYDA  Some men and women slaves appear at work in the garden After the chorus the  CADI  and  FATIMA  rise and are met by  FERDINAND  who presents a letter    CHORUS  AH how sweet the rural scene  Circled by those charming groves  Slavery its labour loves  And the captive hugs his chain  Cadi  Come Fatima we'll rise and take a walk towards the house honeybird You daughter Zorayda may stay in the garden longer if you like it  Ferd  Now love and fortune assist me  kneeling  Most noble Cadi your friend Uchali admiral of the Dey's gallies at Algiers commands me thus to prostrate myself  Cadi  What are you Christian  Ferd  That letter will inform you  Fat  A good personable fellow  Cadi  reading  "The bearer a Spaniard by birth has been a slave of mine upwards of a year during which time he has behaved himself well yesterday  he received money for his ransom and being now free only waits for a ship to carry him to his own country 'till an opportunity offers he desires to remain among your slaves many of whom are his countrymen You may venture to trust him and he will repay your kindness by discharging any office in your family you think proper to appoint him"  Fat  I like him prodigiously  Cadi  This letter is indeed from my friend Uchali Well Christian I have no objection to your staying awhile among my slaves if you will conduct yourself quietly and be of use in my garden here  Ferd  I have been bred to gardening from my youth  Fat  I'll bring him into that arbour where a rosetree and a myrtle are just falling for want of a prop if they were bound together they would help to keep one another up  Cadi  Come into the house I say he does not want your help To work sirrah if you'd stay with me  Fat  Take this little alms to buy you tobacco  Lord my dear why such illnature  Heaven and earth at once demand  Pity for a wretched creature  Captive in a foreign land  Shall our mein of harshness savour  No 'twas never your intent  Yet I hope my kind behaviour  Will be construed as 'twas meant  SCENE II  During the former Scene a black slave brings a basket of flowers to  ZORAYDA  from which she culls a nosegay When the  CADI  and  FATIMA  go off  FERDINAND  advances but retires again upon a motion from  ZORAYDA  who rises afterwards and comes forward    Ferd  They're gone Now might I venture to speak to my dear ZoraydaShe makes signs to me with her hand to keep back I must do so for a while till her father has got at a greater distance  Zor  Cease ye fountains cease to murmur  Leave ye gentle gales to blow  Softly flowing  Gently blowing  Ye but wake my tender woe  Ferd  They are quite out of sight  Zor  Come near then  Ferd  My life my angel  Zor  Have a care My father has been but three days here in the country I perceive you have disposed of the money I conveyed to you in the manner I desired to procure your ransom  Fer  It is true Owing to your bounty I am at length a free man and procured that letter from my former master to be received among your father's slaves which has answered to my wish and I now only wait for your farther commands  Zor  Tho' this is the first time of our speaking together my letters have sufficiently informed you who and what I am You have not forgot the purport of my last  Ferd  No sweet creature  Zor  You know my desire is to become of your religion and to go with you from hence to Spain What have you done about the directions I gave you with regard to that  Ferd  I have spoken to a fast friend of mine a renegado who has taken care to prepare a vessel for our departure Tomorrow night the galley will come to the point west of your garden here with a dozen Spaniards all of them ablebodied rowers and of approved fidelity  Zor  Tomorrow night  Ferd  The sooner we can put our design in execution the better lest some adverse accident should prevent us  Zor  'Tis truestay hereabouts and presently I will come down into the garden again and let you know whether I can be prepared against tomorrow night or not  Poor panting heart ah wilt thou ever  Throb within my troubled breast  Shall I see the moment never  That is doom'd to give thee rest  Cruel stars that thus torment me  Fortune smooths her front in vain  Pleasure's self cannot content me  But is turn'd with me to pain  SCENE III  FERDINAND  and then  FATIMA  in a veil    Ferd  If this be captivity who would not be a captive What a lucky day was it for me when I was set to work upon my master's terras in Algiers where I was seen from the windows of her father's house by this charming infidel who singled me from the rest of my companions  Fat  Thus far my love has carried me almost without my knowledgeYonder he isShall I proceedShall I discover myself  Ferd  not seeing her  Oh sweet Zorayda  Fat  What's that he says  Ferd  Where is my flute I will sit down upon this stump of a tree and whistle away the minutes till she comes back  Fat  Zorayda  Ferd  What melancholy lovetune shall I play now  sits down and plays  Fat  I can hold no longer  slaps him upon the shoulder  Ferd  My dear Zoraydaso soon returned  Fat  AgainWhat's the meaning of this Do you take me for the Cadi's daughter  unveiling  Ferd  By all that's good the nauseous wife  Fat  You are confounded  Ferd  Somewhat nonplust I confess to hear you deny your name so positively Why are you not Zorayda the Cadi's daughter Did not I see you with him but just now Nay were you not so charitable as to give me money  Fat  But I am neither Zorayda nor the Cadi's daughter  Ferd  I know not that but I am sure he is old enough to be your father  Fat  But once againHow came you to name Zorayda  Ferd  Another mistake of mine for asking one of your slaves when I came into the garden who were the chief ladies about the house he answered me Zorayda and Fatima but she it seems is his daughter with a plague to her and you are his beloved wife  Fat  Say your beloved mistress if you please for that's the title I desire  Ferd  Ay but I have a qualm of conscience  Fat  Your conscience was very quiet when you took me for Zorayda  Ferd  I must be plain with youYou are married to a reverend man the head of your law Go back to your chamber madam go back  Fat  No sirrah but I'll teach you to your cost what vengeance is in store for refusing a lady who has offered you her love  For vengeance dire thou wretch prepare  Nought shall my resentment stay  To a lion to a bear  My nature turns  While my bosom burns  To seize my destin'd prey  Oh object to my soul how sweet  To see you grovling at my feet  While I no pity shew  To spurn your tears  To mock your fears  And tread you to the shades below  SCENE IV  FERDINAND FATIMA  and afterwards the  CADI  Ferd  What do you mean madam For Heaven's sake peace  Fat  Ungrateful wretch What do I mean Help help husband my lord Cadi I shall be undone the villain will be too strong for me Help for pity of a poor distress'd creature  Ferd  Then I have nothing but impudence to assist me I must drown the clamour whate'er comes on it  he takes out his flute and plays as loud as he possibly can and she continues crying out  Cadi  What's here What's here  Fat  Oh sweetest I'm glad you're come this Christian slave was going to be rude with me  Cadi  Oh horrid abominable the villainthe monstertake him away flay and impale him rid the world of such a viper  Ferd  First hear me worthy sir What have you seen to provoke you  Cadi  I have heard the outcries of my wife the bleatings of the poor innocent lamb What have I seen quotha If I see the lamb lie expiring and the wolf by her is not that evidence sufficient of the murder  Ferd  Pray think in reason Sir Is a man to be put to death for a similitude No violence has been committed none intended The lamb's alive and if I durst tell you so no more a lamb than I am a wolf  Fat  How's that villain  Ferd  Be patient madam and speak but truth I'll do any thing to serve you  Fat  WellHear him speak husband perhaps he may say something for himself I know not  Cadi  But did he mean no mischief Was he endeavouring nothing  Fat  In my conscience I begin to doubt he did not  Cadi  Then what meant all those outcries  Fat  I heard music in the garden and I stole softly down imagining it might be he  Cadi  How's that Imagining it might be he  Fat  Yes to be sure my lord Am not I the mistress of the family and is it not my place to see good order kept in it I thought he might have allured some of the she slaves to him and was resolved to prevent what might have been betwixt them when on a sudden he rush'd out upon me and caught me in his arms with such a fury  Cadi  I have heard enoughaway with him  Fat  Mistaking me no doubt for one of the slaves that work in the garden With that affrighted as I was I discovered myself and cry'd aloud but as soon as ever he knew me the villain let me go and I must needs say he started back as if I were a serpent and was more afraid of me than I of him  Cadi  O thou ungrateful villain Did'st thou come to get footing in my family in order to corrupt it That's cause enough of death Once more again away with him  Fat  Well but love  Cadi  Speak not for him  Fat  I must speak and you hear me  Cadi  Away with him I say  Fat  What for an intended trespass No harm has been done whatever may be Then consider he does not belong to you and is recommended by a friend you would not chuse to disoblige  Cadi  Why that's true  Ferd  I see she'll bring me off if she can  Cadi  And are you sure rascal you meant no harm  Ferd  No harm upon my reputationno more than the child unborn I was playing here by myself such is my foolish custom and took madam as she says for one of the female slaves employ'd in your garden  Cadi  Well sirrah to your kennel mortify your flesh and consider in whose family you are  Ferd  Yes sir I'll consider  Fat  And learn another time to treat the Cadi's wife as she would have you  Cadi  What do you mean by that  Fat  What do I meanI'll shew you what I meangive the puppy a remembrancer  Cadi  Come comeenough  Fat  Do let me beat him a little husband  Cadi  No wifenoGet in before me  Fat  Why sure  Cadi  Get in I say  Fat  I wont  Cadi  March  Fat  Well I will marchbut if I am not revenged on you for this you old tyrant the Devil take me  Cadi  For all her art  I see her heart  She counterfeits too grosly  And Lady fair  I shall take care  To watch your waters closely  I'm us'd to keep  A rod in steep  For long I've had suspicion  And if I find  She's ill inclin'd  I'll bring her to contrition  SCENE V  FERDINAND  and then  ZORAYDA  behind him    Zor  Christian where are you  Ferd  'Tis her voiceI can't be mistaken again  Zor  Ferdinand  Ferd  Zorayda  Zor  Yes 'tis I  Ferd  Come nearer that I may be sure  Zor  There there  Ferd  Do you know what has happened to me since you went away  Zor  Yes yes I know it all"Any thing to serve you Madam"Whose words were these Gentleman  Ferd  Come don't make yourself worse natur'd than you areTo save my life you would be content I should promise any thing  Zor  Yes if I was sure you would perform nothing  Ferd  But is your motherinlaw such a virago  Zor  What do you think of her  Ferd  Hang me if I know what to think of her but this I'm sure of she had like to play the Devil with me  Zor  Well I assure you these freaks are nothing with herI perceiv'd she took a fancy for you the moment she saw youHowever beware of herYou think that's her face you see but 'tis only a dawb'd vizard And for constancy I can tell you for your comfort she would love till deathI mean till yoursfor when she was tir'd of you she would certainly dispatch you to another world for fear of telling tales  Ferd  But why all thisWhat's Fatima to meYou cannot imagine I would exchange a diamond for a pebble stone  Zor  NoBut I think you might like to have the diamond and the pebble stone too by way of variety  Ferd  By this fair hand I swear  Zor  Well comeWhat do you swear  Ferd  To resist temptation  Zor  To avoid it is better And since you say your friends and your ship will be ready tomorrow night tomorrow night I am determined to go off with youMeet me here about ten o'clockI'll slip down from my chamber and bring my father in my hand  Ferd  Your father  Zor  I mean what he considers as the better part of himhis pearls and jewelshis whole contentshis heart and soulas much as ever I can carry  Ferd  I shall be gone this moment and inform my companions  Thus low for all your favours  Behold your servant bends  Through life my best endeavours  Shall be to make amends  Though life's too short to prove  My truth my gratitude and love  Dear liberty possessing  Can man more happy be  But what endears the blessing  Is that it comes from thee  SCENE VII  ZORAYDA  Let me consider a littleAm not I a mad wicked girl going to forsake my father and leave my country to run into a strange one with a slave whose freedom I purchase and I first saw by accident thro' a window in my father's house that look'd into the place where he work'dWhy on maturely weighing the matter not so mad and wicked as I at first appear I have long hated both our Mahometan laws and religion in my heart and I have no means to get rid of them both but by putting myself in the hands of a ChristianThis is a handsome man I am sure and I will believe him an honest one  The wretch condemn'd with life to part  Yet yet on hope relies  And the last sigh that rends his heart  Bids expectation rise  Hope like the glimm'ring taper light  Adorns and chears our way  And still as darker grows the night  Emits a brighter ray  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Scene changes to another View of the Garden by Moonlight with a Balcony and Portico belonging to the  CADI  's Hause    FERDINAND  enters leading  ZORAYDA  Ferd  I have been waiting here I know not how longWhy thou sweet delicious creature why torture me with thy delayAnd art thou come at lastBut where hast thou beenI was almost in despair  Zor  Don't be angry it was well I could come at all There has been a strange bustle this evening within  Ferd  As how What has been the matter  Zor  Some cause which my father has lately decided and to tell you the truth I believe not with the strictest attention to justice however the party has carryed his complaint to the Dey and he has been obliged to go to court about it but he's come back again and I fancy the storm is pretty well blown over  Ferd  And what are we to do now  Zor  Why what we have already schemed but as I had outstay'd the time appointed I just slipped down to see if you had patience to keep to your post  Ferd  Could you doubt it  Zor  Is the galley ready  Ferd  I'm but this moment come from it It lies within a pistol shot of us just without the little gate of your garden which leads to the sea  Zor  Well I'll run up again and bring down what I told you in the mean time do you take another look towards the galley and prepare the men for our reception  Ferd  I have entrusted a countryman of mine one of your father's slaves with our design I left him on the watch but I'll go myself  Zor  Heigho  Ferd  What's the matter  Zor  SomethingI don't know what  Ferd  Nay my love  Zor  Let me lean upon your armIt will away againMy courage is good for all this  Ferd  Zorayda  Zor  Feel my heart  Ferd  Poor little thing how it throbs  Zor  Oh me  Alas 'tis in vain my distress to dissemble  I wish yet with fear I my wishes pursue  I fain would be gone yet in going I tremble  No stay to support me no pilot but you  At once friends and father and country forsaking  New faith new companions new climates to try  Each step that I tread tender thoughts are awaking  And still I look back and withdraw with a sigh  SCENE II  The  CADI  alone in a Slave's Habit like that of  FERDINAND's  This it is to have a sound headpieceI have mewed up my suspected spouse in her chamberNo more embassies to that lusty young Christian Next by this habit of a slave I have made myself as like him as I can Now walking under the windows of my Seraglio if Fatima should look out she will certainly take me for Ferdinand and call to me and by that I shall know what concupiscence is working in her She cannot come down to commit iniquity there's my safety but if she peep if she put her note abroad there's demonstration of her pious will and let me alone to work her for it  In emblem I am like a cat  That's watching for a mouse  Close by his hole behold her squat  While her heart goes pitapat  If a squeaking she hears  She pricks up her ears  And when he appears  Leaps on him souse  And so will I do with my wife  Just so will I watch her  And so if I catch her  I'll worry her out of her life  SCENE III  The  CADI ZORAYDA  running to him with the Casket in her Hand    Zor  Now I can embrace you with a good conscicenceHere are the pearls and jewelshere's my father  Cadi  I am indeed thy father but how the Devil didst thou know me in this disguiseand what pearls and jewels dost thou mean  Zor  What have I done and what will now become of me  Cadi  Ar't thou mad Zorayda  Zor  I think you will make me so  Cadi  WhyWhat have I done to youRecollect thyself and speak sense to me  Zor  Then give me leave to tell you that you are the worst of fathers  Cadi  Did I think I had got such a monsterProceed my dutiful child proceed proceed  Zor  You have been raking together a mass of wealth by indirect and wicked means The spoils of orphans are in these jewels and the tears of widows are in these pearls  Cadi  You amaze me  Zor  I would do soThis casket is loaded with your sins 'Tis the cargo of rapine and extortion the iniquity of thirty years cadiship converted into diamonds  Cadi  Would some rich railing rogue dare say as much to me that I might squeeze his purse for scandal  Zor  Here Sir don't think I'll be the receiver of your theftsI discharge my conscience of themHere take again your filthy mammon and restore it you had best to the true owners  Cadi  I am finely documented by my own daughter  Zor  And a great credit to me to be soDo but think how decent a habit you have on and how becoming your function to be disguised like a slave and evesdropping under the womens windows  Cadi  Pr'ythee child reproach me no more of human sailingsI am better at bottom than thou thinkestI am not the man you take me for  Zor  No to my sorrow Sir you are not  Cadi  It was a very bad beginning tho' methought to see you come running upon me with such a warm embracePr'ythee what was meaning of that violent hot hug  Zor  I'm sure I meant nothing but the zeal and affection which I bear to the man in the world whom I love best  Cadi  Why this is as it should beTake the treasure againIt will never be put into better hands  But pr'ythee spare me dearest daughter  If ought that's past my conscience stings  Down my old cheeks it forces water  To hear your cruel taunts and flings  You should consider child if I  Have in my office grip'd too nigh  'Twas to the end that you might have  My wealth when I was in the grave  My failings then no longer press  We all have errors more or less  SCENE IV  The  CADI ZORAYDA FERDINAND  in a rich habit    Ferd  What do you mean my dear to stand talking in this suspicious place just under Fatima's windowYou are well met comrade I know you are the friend of our flight  Cadi  Ferdinand in disguiseNow I begin to smell a rat  Ferd  And I another that outstinks itFalse Zorayda thus to betray me to your father  Zor  Alas I was betrayed

loose now tho' you left a limb behind you but I am yet in my territories and in call of company that's my comfort  Ferd  Know I have a trick yet to put you past your squeaking  Zor  What do you meanYou will not throttle himConsider he's my father  Ferd  Pr'ythee let us provide first for our own safetyIf I do not consider him he will consider us with a vengeance afterwards  Zor  You may threaten him from crying out but for my sake give him back a little cranny of his windpipe and some part of speech  Ferd  Not so much as one single interjectionCome away fatherinlaw this is no place for dialoguesWhen you are upon the bench you talk by hours and there no man must interrupt youThis is but like for like good fatherinlawNow I am on the bench 'tis your turn to hold your tongue  He struggles    Nay if you will be hanging back I shall take care  you shall hang forwards  Pulls him along the stage with a sword at his reins  Zor  T'other way to the arbour with him and make haste before we are discovered  Ferd  If I only bind and gag him there he may commend me hereafter for civil usage he deserves not so much favour for any action of his life  Zor  Yes pray bate him one for begetting your mistress  Ferd  Once more come along in silence my Pythagorian fatherinlaw  Zor  Oh dear medear meI wish it was well overAll I'm afraid of is that my courage or strength will fail meWell is he safe  Ferd  Yes yesI have lodg'd himHe won't trouble us within this half hour I warrant you  Now now my fairest let us go  Fortune Fate can frown no more  A gentle gale begins to blow  To waft us to a safer shore  Let us the fav'ring minute seize  Give all our canvas to the wind  Take with us freedom love and ease  And leave remorse and pain behind  SCENE V  ZORAYDA FERDINAND FATIMA

enough to condemn him and an order is issued to strangle him and seize upon his effects It is not a  moment since the guards thinking he was hid in my room broke open the door where he had lock'd me up  Ferd  And where are they now  Fat  I had the presence of mind to tell them that the Cadi was at a house he has twelve miles off where they are gone to look for him by which means we have an hour or two's respite to look about us  Zor  Alas what good can we derive from that  Ferd  Hold stay hereBy Heaven I have a thought  Fat  Dear Zorayda give me your hand if there was ever any jealousies
