 THE RELIEF OR DAY THOUGHTS A POEM  OCCASIONED BY THE  OMPLAINT OR NIGHT THOUGHTS  Humbly Inscribed to The RIGHT HONOURABLE The EARL of HOLDERNESS  Assert Eternal Providence  And justify the Ways of God to Men  MILTON  LONDON Printed in the Year MDCCLIV  THE RELIEF A POEM  WHY all this solemn apparatus why  Why all this din about a worm's concerns  The child of dust of misery of scorn  The prey of flattery the food of pride  ain expectation's bubble reason's dupe  frantic hope misled and lost in whirls  visionary scenes enchanted piles  he fancy'd fabricks built by vanity  pon the vapours of a heated brain  craft kept up in injur'd reason's spight  custom held in reverential awe  e sacred bugbears of a frighted world  To serve the purpose of designing knaves  And yoke the neck of fools  The awful temples tombs and rolling clocks  The midnight damps that drop from weeping yews  Beneath th' eclipsed moon the scriechowl's haunt  Drenching the locks of some nightwatching pilgrim  Who sits in dismal meditation wrapt  And brainsick horror o'er yon mould'ring grave  By time defac'd and frequent footsteps worn  No mark remaining but th' erected stone  Inscrib'd with narratives uncouth of birth  Of death a mute unmeaning blank between  The chissel's story to the pensive hind  Who painful pores upon the wasted words  And puzzling scans th' imperfect characters  Half hid in nettles and perplex'd with thorn  Here moping superstition nightly broods  Here counts the clarion of the bird of dawn  Whose dreary note proclaims the ebbing night  And drives the frighted goblin to his haunt  The timerecording cock or to the winds  Repeats her unavailing vespers o'er  The winds that mournful yell from  vaults  And broken sepulchres their groaning access  As if they wail'd the longdeparting dead  Who slumber deep in everlasting night  Within these dreary mansions where no dawn  Returns Thus hideous melancholy dips  Her pencil still in dark delusive tincts  And paints the face of things detested growpe  A landskip fit for hell the work of fiends  Let rescu'd fancy turn aloft her eye  And view yon wide extended arch behold  Yon crystal concave studded with the gems  The radiant gems of heav'n that nightly burn  In golden lamps and gild th' aetherial space  That smiling vault that canopy of stars  Those cluster'd constellations mark yon moon  Serenely shine her borrow'd lustre full  The mountain tops the rocks the vales the lawns  By her set off adorn'd and made delightful  The boundless main a polish'd mirror now  Reflecting from its bosom back the vast  The wonderful the glorious glad appearance  Bright visions eccho to th' inchanted eye  As on the ear harmonious sounds return  In mimic notes responsive made to fill  To charm the fancy with repeated transport  All these in their eternal round rejoice  All these with universal praise proclaim  Their great creator bountiful benign  Immensely good rejoicing in his creatures  Behold yon blazing sun but Oh to what  To what shall we compare away with such  A thought to what resemble him this globe  Ten thousand thousand worlds beyond where space  Exists where matter lives beyond the grasp  Of human thought imagination's ken  Nay reason's reach the intellect of angels  But silence best becomes the boundless theme  In wonder swallow'd up and deep astonishment  What should we fear this glorious prospect brings  No dreadful phantom to the frighted eye  No terror to the soul 'tis transport all  Here fancy roves in sweet variety  For ever lost her native bliss For her  The blue ethereal arch expands her table  Spread out with all the dainties of the sky  Imagination's rich regale For her  The clouds absorb the ev'ning ray and drink  The liquid gold which stains their fleecy sides  With all the tincts of heav'n transmitted through  A thousand diff'rent strainers to the eye  And thence upon the ravish'd soul diffus'd  The blushing beauties of the infant morn  Aurora's saffron beam the splendid bow  Whose copious arch was bent by hands divine  An emblem form'd of half eternity  By angels robe'd in all the aggregate  Th' unblended aggregate of various day  Of heav'n's own day and from its sunbeams drawn  In all its tinges dipt its glories dress'd  For her the smiling earth puts on her mantle  Her mantle green with purple mix'd with gold  With all the liv'ries of the youthful spring  To wake new raptures in the heart of man  And fill his soul with gratitude immense  All these are reason's treasures stores of thought  Reflection's unexhausted funds replete  With matter for her own delightful task  Here wisdom works at large here smiling builds  For sweet content a homely shed where joy  Where gladness visit oft her temp'rate guests  And make their willing stay here undisturb'd  They reign they revel take their fill of all  That nature ever bounteous mother yields  For use or pleasure but excess avoid  That fiend accurs'd whose bloated visage wan  And troubled eye betray her inward pang  Which shakes severe her paralytic nerve  Her tott'ring frame e'er death by nature taught  And time in season due with gentle hand  Can cut the wasted thread excess usurps  With force th' abortive task and vindicates  Her preyCome all ye family of joy  Ye children of the chearful hour begot  By wisdom on the virtuous mind O come  Come innocence in conscious strength secure  Come courage foremost in the manly train  Come all and in the honest heart abide  Your native residence your fortress still  From real or from fancy'd evils free  O come indignant drive out far beyond  The utmost precincts of the human breast  Beyond the springs of hope the cells of joy  And ev'ry mansion where a virtue lives  O drive far off for ever drive that bane  That hideous pest engender'd deep in hell  Where Stygian glooms condens'd dimension'd darkness  Contains within its dire embrace that monster  Horrid to sight and by the frighted furies  In their dread pannic SUPERSTITION nam'd  The close contracted span of human life  Is dearly purchas'd by the sons of care  Since sickness disappointment pain and death  A thousand vary'd unavoided evils  Prey hourly on the vexing heart of man  Like officers of wrath let loose by pride  To raise the rigid tax on wretched being  A dreadful int'rest for a sum so small  Enough are these alas to gall and sting  What need we then for fancy'd evils seek  To scare the soul and harrow up the heart  Already toss'd and torn and broken down  By evils of its own contrivance evils  Still adverse found to nature's wholsome ways  The bane of ev'ry bliss and social joy  Ambition with her train and luxury  With custom link'd with fell corruption join'd  Led up by fashion in her frantic dance  Follow'd by misery despair and death  For pity's sake forbear to haunt the world  With hideous spectres and fantastic forms  With harpy footed furies fearful phantoms  Everlasting torments and unquenched fire  O say what horrid scenes are these you draw  What portraits of th' Almighty hence away  See reason turns the face aside see nature  Start at the monstrous form and cry aloud  Through all her works It is not like Forbear  Ye croaking ministers of midnight dreams  Ye madding trumpeters of false report  Forbear to pour your ghastly images  On truth nor give just providence the lie  What's a churchyard what I pray this horri  goblin  Array'd in midnight weeds by frantic fancy  I' th' solemn moonstruck hour a bed prepar'd  For silent unperceiving dust that once  To human thought was wedded vital clay  Divorc'd by death to join the general mother  Divided far from its companion dear  Th' immortal soul that now above the stars  Forgets this trampled clod and joins the choirs  Of bliss 'tis gloomy all and solemn Hark  Was it the clock that told the passing hour  And told it too at midnight when deep silence  And hideous darkness reign o'er half the world  It wasWhat then it tells it too at noon  Amidst the noise and sunshine of that hour  The clock that calls to business or to pleasure  The sons of avarice and sensual joy  What tragic bustle when an engine strikes  Shall meer negations unsubstantial shades  Such monsters form to fright th' unthinking crowd  To fancy tangible to terror real  Let monks let nurses put these vizors on  To startle bigots and astonish babes  Reason scorns and common sense defies 'em  And who so weak to shudder at the sound  Of yon departed moment fled for ever  Or with his sad foreboding sighs keep time  To each elapsing sand that silent flows  From his exhausting glass with breaking heart  "O wretched avarice of breath to draw  "Fresh air or gaze upon the wearied sun  To tread the same unvary'd round with pain  To eat to drink to sleep to satisfy  Each sensual sordid appetite alas  How oft have distant prospects verdant views  With all that fortune's faithless flattering mirror  To sanguine pride presents and vain selflove  How oft has cheated hope complain'd and sought  or refuge in despair the sense itself  Grows weary of the toil the beastly toil  And reason oft repeats this lesson learn'd  From pain 'tis time to die and what is time  elf this awful sire of births prodigious  The creature of the mind no more the vassal  Of thought whose very being is the soul  Made short or long as that is more or less  Employ'dGood heav'n and earth what horrid noise  What stir about a reptile's poor concerns  And when a worm expires shall nature say  Shall suffering nature sympathize with me  Reeccho groan for groan so pride asserts  O monstrous pride made drunk by fancy at  Ambition's feast Shall yonder sun be hid  Fierce  Aetna  flame and thunder shake the poles  Because forsooth some spring eccentric moves  Within this frail machine and passion sways  The soul for this the universal flood  Broke loose beyond its stated bounds for this  The mountains melt the comets glare for this  Shall famine pestilence and war devour  But hark th' infernal forge begins to roar  The sounds of sorrow and the yells of pain  Now tear the shop of death and reach my sense  The flames ascend the furies howl and all  The Stygian eccho's ring a peal a peal so loud  That shakes the north of hell and makes the throne  Of terror start O whence this fierce uproar  This strong convulsion in the realms of woe  Behold yon reptile gasping in the arms  Th' inexorable arms of death how pale  How ghastly are its looks Ah see how fear  How dread distort the face and fix the eye  The pallid eye that window of the soul  The parting soul that spark of entity  Which now stands shiv'ring on the verge of life  And views th' imaginary gulph beneath  What horrors O what anguish must she taste  Whilst yet her faculties are left entire  Whilst yet she views the gaping fiends and flames  O say can human thought can words express  What nature feels in that tremenduous hour  What pangs what spasms twisting too and fro  With irritated force convulsive tug  The rooted fibres and the springs of life  By horrors heighten'd and distemper'd fumes  That rack the mind and tear the tortur'd frame  Till the crack'd heart subdu'd at length forgets  To pant and death in mercy ends the fray  Nor only then when near th' expiring gasp  Tho' then each moment counterweighs an age  Not only then but through the goaded length  Of harrass'd life we drag the burden'd weight  Of slavish fear impos'd on childhood's thought  By ignorance made grey in gainful error  And credulous design who sit enthron'd  Like tyrants of an antient race to plead  Prescription's right and rule the passive soul  Can then a gracious GOD be said to call  From forth the vacant unexisting blank  A race of creatures capable of joy  Enrich'd with thought and warm with fierce desire  With delicate sensations cover'd o'er  And nice perception prompt to gratify  Th' implanted impulse and the vig'rous call  When nature makes her strong her just demand  When passion rises at the loud alarm  Led up by reason to the genial task  By reason guided to the wise retreat  Can justice punish what herself decrees  And make obedience to her laws a crime  Justice is nature in her social dress  And social virtue is the voice of heav'n  Shall arbitrary cobwebs skreen this truth  With positive dogmatical behests  And give yon blazing sun the lye Awake  Unhoodwink'd man and cast abroad thy eyes  Behold all nature in one gen'rous strife  The war of amity and discord sweet  The strife of strong benevolence behold  The universal agents all at work  From diff'rent quarters with contending pow'rs  In hostile harmony to propagate  One glorious and eternal good to man  To beasts to fish to fowl to plants perhaps  To all that feel th' informing touch of good  With grateful energy their texture strike  And send the gladsome tiding to the soul  See nature in her various stile express  The thankful tribute of incessant praise  From lifeless matter to the sprouting blade  Of humble grass upon the liv'ry'd lawn  From trodden daisies to the plant of JOVE  Behold the genial aether swarm with life  With quick'ning millions float Behold the ant  That citizen severe with all her tribes  Incorporate or diff'rent colour'd train  Denisons of dust and privileg'd to think  Employ their parsimonious intellect  And in their turn rejoice 'Tis life's great charter  Giv'n from eternity to all that breathe  Shall those to whom our jealous pride denies  Superior talents and immortal thought  Shall they in selffelicity flow o'er  And mental transport since no joy alas  But in the mind can live shall they whom we  Meer animates miscall shall they rejoice  With fearless hearts of shadows fearless made  And fancy'd terrors all Imaginary  Phantoms From these exempt they live at ease  Regale each sense enjoy existence still  Without excess The sons of pride may here  Be taught what instinct and what reason mean  Reason thou title to superior rank  Thou dear bought purchase of the sons of EVE  What ravens vultures and what harpies cry  What clang incessant o'er thy destin'd head  And scare thy timid soul thou lord of nature  Beast and angel join'd eccentric wretch  The property of custom fraud and cunning  The dupe of arrogance the fool of forms  With envious eyes from thy exalted stand  Look down upon thy subject world and ask  Thy own experienc'd heart what living thing  Amidst the meanest reptiles in thy reign  Can suffer such extremes of woe as thee  Rise up thou glorious attribute assert  Thy native dignity rise up once more  In injur'd man's defence rise reason rise  And with thy ray invincible drive far  These fancyform'd these monsterstalking shades  These giant shapes by melancholy seen  With horrid strides to glance athwart the sick  Imagination curtain'd in already  By superstition's hand and terrify'd  By her magnific glass reflecting still  The midnight goblin and the ghastly shade  In justice to thy great creator rise  To human nature and to injur'd truth  Thou attribute divine thou ray of GOD  Immortal reason come and with thee bring  In thy exulting train invincible  The honest purpose and the chearful heart  The joyful fancy fill'd with images  Of truth of science and of social love  Let friendship too be there O closer to  Thy sacred breast embrace her closer yet  She comes she comes from heav'n her native place  And with her see whate'er deserves thy wish  Whate'er is cordial comely and humane  Whate'er is rational whate'er is pure  The handmaid of th' Almighty sent to bless  The suffering sons of men to soften sorrow  To sweeten care Seraphic guest all hail  Thou dearer than relations dear than son  Than father brother wife or tender tye  Thou child of sweet benevolence begot  By reason on the virtuous heart arise  Thou best belov'd of heav'n thou joy thou crown  Of man arise and from thy sacred presence  Drive far each hideous apparition form'd  By midnight hags beneath th' abortive gloom  The bane of ev'ry social bliss thy bane  What magic sounds are these that pow'rful shed  Their thrilling transport through the raptur'd soul  And captivate each thought 'tis music's charms  Hark again again they strike again possess  The heart O sweeter louder yet proclaim  Thy large dominion o'er the kindred soul  Extatic harmony triumphant bliss  To the glad heart where virtue tunes the strings  Awake awake each chearful thought arise  At that seraphic call 'tis friendship's voice  Good nature now arise in smiles array'd  Thou welcome guest with aspect open still  And with unguarded lip because thy heart  With social fervor glows and sends its message  To the rich tongue by sense directed still  By prudence taught behold yon smiling bowl  By temp'rance mix'd with chearful hand invite  Thy lip see blushing beauty there adorn'd  With modesty sublime with meekness robe'd  With grace invincible attract the soul  And heighten ev'ry joy thou fugitive  Fly far intruding care from hence fly far  And in some Gothic cell with superstition  With slavish horror make thy drear abode  Let in the mimic arts the muse shall lead  Them in herself their chief their crown their pride  Immortal pride that hands them safe through all  The havock and the wrecks of time by her  Preserv'd recorded and immortal made  Behold the magic pencil's mock creation  The peopled canvass and the story'd wall  How life how passion blend together there  To ravish and to warm the wond'ring soul  And lift its faculties to heav'n O there  Let fancy feast and take her fill of all  That genius or that learning yield of all  That dignity or grace bestow to banquet  Reason and chear the heart susceptible  Whom genius taste and science form'd to feel  To foster cherish and enjoy the guests  Divine the soul congenial copious warm  Exalted and humane with op'ning arms  Will rush to meet embrace and welcome in  Th' angelic visitants in meek disguise  In  Britain  yet alas how few the friends  The hospitable friends they find yet there  Yet even there a CHESTERFIELD and HOLDERNESS  Anxious for their country's fading glory  Inspir'd by genius and immortal fame  Throw wide their gates and hail the mimic arts  Abroad abroad there health invites thee forth  There pleasure courts thee in her russet robe  Magnificent the morning gales arise  With freighted pinions wafting all the east  In od'rous incense to thy ravish'd mind  Thy mind dilated now with all the wide  Extended various prospect stretch'd beneath  The cope of heav'n sublime delicious feast  Th' ecchoing hills the chearing horn delight  The soul exerting clangor rip'ning CERES  And the rich swelling grape in these exult  In these rejoice thy lot bestow'd O man  Whilst youth and vigour in thy heart remain  And nature bids thee to her banquet come  Thy portion giv'n beneath the sun Once more  Collect thy pow'rs divine once more drive off  That evil thing call'd fear that slavish fiend  Let hope let joy thy bosom inmates be  Through life still cherish'd and in death held fast  A gracious GOD loud speaking to thy heart  Through all his works this truth inculcates still  Nature's thy nurse and providence thy friend  Integrity with fearless heart ride on  Undaunted tread the various path through life  Which leads to death that hospitable stage  Where weary nature takes her last repose  And lays her down from toil and pain to rest  In sweet oblivion wrapt remote from grief  And all th' ingrafted ills which life has foster'd  Why should approaching death affright the soul  Why reason start and turn away from him  Who comes to bring us home from misery  Mistake and fear the messenger of heav'n  No grisly terror to the honest heart  If GOD be just O blasphemy to doubt  His justice

Thou glorious sun of unperceiving things  Thy maker's brightest image O declare  Was it thy great thy good creator's view  O horrid plan to cheat me into being  To gratify revenge and rage eternal  In

 Yet hold Compassion patience and redress  Still best become thee 'tis but frenzy all  And brainsick rant which physick should remove  And reason cool Thou homicide forbear  And from thy throat thy desp'rate hand withdraw  Lay down the murd'rous knife the loaded gun  And fling the baneful volume by nay burn it  Tear scatter it abroad O quick deface  The pestilential lye that taints the whole  And breathes thro' ev'ry page A way with fuel  Contagion from the eyes of man with tombs  With churchyards tolling midnight clocks away  With fun'ral pomp with gloomy mock parade  With sable hearses scutcheons nodding plumes  And all the dismal pegeantry of death  Let fancy drive these goblins from her sight  Let mirth let joy let transport fill their place  Philosophy and faith shall hand them in  And nature bid them welcome O rejoice  Distinguish'd man rejoice how bless'd thy lot  Whilst reason is thy guide look up look up  O see where hope stands pointing to the sky  On sunbeams rais'd by angels beckon'd on  See her celestial flight where thou shalt follow  Turn thy eyes thither thither lift thy heart  Thy gracious GOD awaits thee there to him  Thou shalt return in season due to taste  Immortal transports thy beginning end  Thy center father saviour and thy friend  FINIS
