MR TAYLOR  Spoken by  MR HOLMAN  In these dread times when WAR's unsated rage  Crowds with disasters LIFE's eventful stage  When the full trumpet and embattled ire  Drown the soft warblings of the slighted Lyre  The MUSES' lonely haunts no more display  Among their with'ring blooms the POET's BAY  The partial soil THE LAUREL only rears  For martial wreaths that  vegetate in tears  At such a time superfluous seems the art  To melt with fabled woes the sadden'd heart  The sorrowing MUSES need themselves relief  And FANCY droops in sympathetic grief  The TRAGIC MAID indeed may sooth her care  And future scenes from passing ills prepare  But for the LAUGHING NYMPH alas can she  At ease presume with her untimely glee  Is there a place amidst the world's alarms  In safety still to heed her frolic charms  Yesin the shades of BRITAIN's happy Isle  Still may the COMIC MUSE securely smile  Still with her tuneful Sisters shelter here  Nor savage ANARCHY's vain menace fear  Here no DIRE RUFFIANS dead to gen'rous joy  All that endears and brightens life destroy  Or drench'd in blood with impious rage combine  Trampling o'er THRONES to crush the HALLOW'D SHRINE  No DESPOT here exacts a slavish awe  The casual impulse of his passions LAW  Here on a rock secure amid the storm  Dwells LIBERTY in fair monarchic form  Around her FAME with venerable grace  THREE MATCHLESS COLUMNS fortify the place  Enthron'd within preeminently great  Sits awful JUSTICE in majestic slate  Of LQUAL LAWS the animating soul  And station'd HIGHEST to survey THE WHOLE  Her SWORD by MERCY check'd as urg'd

How crusty you've got with our lodger Miss Louisa only because she's a lady and you think she has a deal of money  Joll  Why to be sure her money did not do much mischief when it bought tidy warm cloathing for half the poor of our village and the setting up the little school and paying you for teaching the children as our rascally rich folks here refused to establish one our gentry expect forsooth 'cause I'm a miller think I must cringe and sneak but I'll never bow to the golden calf People to get money stick at no villany or meanness and then they're as saucyDame I've been round the customers to gather in rent for my landlord Master Allbut Here  Takes out a banknote  Marg  Ten pounds I suppose its having so much money that's made you so saucy this morning  Joll  Ecod wife I believe so As I come up street cou'dn't tell what was the matter with me met honest Dick the coblercame out with his "good morrow Master Jollyboy" I felt a sort of athought he might as well have said nothing Tom the farrier gave me a friendly smack o' th' shoulder I had a mind to knock him down  for his joke then now coming into my own house forgot to stoop and bump'd my forehead against the top o' the doorcase Oh ho then it's the cash has done all this I wish 'twas gone for while I have it I feel I shall be as impudent as the devil  Marg  Madam Louisa  looking out  Joll  Doctor Grigthy with

people's folly and now don't know how to behave himself  Marg  I wish you'd learn how to behave yourself strutting about with your hat on and a lady in the room  Joll  I know nothing about ladies or gentlemen That fellow was a good barber till money spoiled himmy hat  takes it off  my hat's hereand now it's there  puts it on  What signifies where a man's hat is Hats and beads ladiesgentlemengood as anotherhem  siruts off muttering  Marg  Plague take you for a foolas goodnatur'd a man as ever broke bread but when he gets these fancies in his noddle  Louisa  Where there is real worth these little oddities of humour rather excite pleasantry than resentment  Marg  Od I'll give it him  Louisa  Never mind now my kind MargeryI'm sorry I must leave you  Marg  Leave us Well if I didn't expect my silly husband's behaviour wou'd bring it to this  Louisa  Hush your husband has nothing to do in it I'm certain I can confide in youyou know little of me I'm a strangerbut I'll not trouble you with more of my affairs than just necessary You doubtless concluded from  the trisling sums I expended on my first coming here into your village that I must of course be some very rich body or other  Marg  La Ma'am I didn't expect you for that  Louisa  I believe it From certain family circumstances immaterial to any but myself I have been obliged tohowever you know I came from Irelandhave been in France andI am unfortunately not on the best terms with my friends till a make up can be brought about to my wish Not being over strong in purse I plann'd a frugal retirement the variety of calls upon the feelings of my heart have at length exhausted my little finance therefore but mind I'm not cast downno I'm as happy  Marg  Dear I'm so sorry  Louisa  Come if you go to pity me I shall be very much affronted  Marg  I affront you  Louisa  Lord I never was more gay or cheerful in my whole life but I'll tell youYou know you and your husband are very honest people and get nothing but what you hardly earn now why should I from my extravagance become a burden to you  Marg  Extravagance 'twas your charityburden your stay will be a blessing to uspay us when you can or never  weeping  Oh my sweet lady  Louisa  Come perhaps I mayn't leave your village But yet better some strange placetho' who here knows me  aside  Margery I've conceiv'd a thought to stay among you without inconvenience to any one I think I cou'd be useful to your Mistress Allbut here From her character of a passion for literary amusements she might perhaps afford me a situation to read or translate French transcribe her poetry for I am told she has wrote a number of pretty things or cou'd upon occasion dress up a cap for hereh Margery cou'd you recommend me You know you told me she sometimes reads her poems to you  Marg  EhWell I'll call on her my lady  Louisa  Come none of your lady's to meI must soon unlady myself Upon my honour I shall be exceeding angry if you are not even merry There now that's a dear good woman

distress'd about any one's poverty her hand knows the way to her pocket a road it has so often gone upon like occasions  Marg  Ay but I may as well put my hand into my pocket  Joll  Deuce o' your riddlesWhat's the matter with with you and she  Marg  I tell you at last she herself is really distress'd and won't stay because she can't pay us  Exit melancholy  Joll  Distress'd Oh dearone that was so ready to relieve every body else now to want it herself  Louisa advances Jollyboy takes off his hat with great respect  Madam I'm sure I'm vastly concerned that any past conduct of mine shou'd have given you the least uneasiness You've done us too much honour in coming under our roof and if any improper freedoms of ours have given you offence you have only to blame your own condescension Madam we are but ignorant people and if we have fail'd in our respect I humbly crave your pardon  Louisa  Then Margery has told him This is an attempt at ironyBecome the subject of ridicule I thought I could endure poverty but I was wrong  aside  Sir it's not immediately in my power to discharge what I already owe you but hope soon for I can assure you it wou'd give me infinite pleasure  Joll  Wou'd it thentho' I go to jail for my own rent  aside  True I forgotMa'am this was left for you just now 'twas inclos'd in a paperthought at first 'twas for myself so broke it openI beg pardontho' there was nothing written in't  Louisa  Ten pounds Who left it  Joll  I did ask but can't find who  Louisa  Then my circumstances are known Is there such benevolence However how to appropriate this  doesn't want a consideration Pray let me know what I'm indebted to you  Joll  Oh Madam  Louisa  I request  Joll  Well Madam since here now have I given what I had to pay my own rent 'twill grind my heart to apolgoise to Landlord Allbutbut I've set her heart at ease and that's good amends  Grig  without  No I want my chay so put that hamper of wine and take the med'cines round in the little cart  Joll

up hard words from the apothecary's boys marrying the housekeeper throwing her purloinings into a brandy vault and drugshop she poisoned herself in one of them and now by jargon smiles lies and cringes has glided into the good graces of every family in the villageOh he's not dressed in his physical pomp When he wants to shew his consequence pops himself into one of the famous fine velvet and gold suits left him by his old master the physician  Marg  without  Indeed Doctor  Grig  without  But I will visit my patient  Joll  Ay now for Dr Grigsby's chatt'ring 'Till he's gone we may put our

Louisa  Hush  Grig  My dear Madam never deceive your doctorbut that is impossible  Louisa  For me to think of attempting a deception Upon my word Doctor you have the happiest mode of compliment  Grig  Yes Ma'am the compliment I put in that mixture was two grains or as we of the faculty write in our Latin proscriptions dux graniorum six scruples or caterscrupolibus and Madam I'll venture to assirm that the whole material medicar does not furnish a cure of more efficacious efficasey that is when we talk of a case razorcasehem I mean the soulcase the body being the case of the soul as a bottle is of a bottle of old port the wine being the spirit and so we doctors wax the cork to prevent evaporation or somentation just as if a gentleman to shave his chin would lather his occiput that is what we of the faculty call the whole healing artscammony wild poppy the sublimate of styptic water anthelmintic wine hicra picra and the nervous system  Louisa  Sir you've certainly a prodigious deal of skill but nature prevents me from opportunities of putting it in practice  Grig  True Miss I have an immense deal of practice so muchthe fatigueknocked up at all hours  Marg  Ah Doctor you're such a

and company is  Grig  If indisposed Madam what's better company than your doctor For in your case as we of the faculty say no aliment so mucilaginous as sheep's head broth some prefer buttermilk and it is indeed as a lacteal lachrymoligonfor Madam when the disease proceeds from a viscid pituitous substance obstructing the vessels of the lungs we of the faculty call it a spurious peripneumony therefore ripe fruits roasted bak'd or boil'd such as greengoose young parsneps extract of saturnthen we throw in the bark and that is my dear Madam thethe nervous system  Marg  But Doctor Miss Louisa wants a little rest  Grig  Ha ha ha that's very wellthen I know nothing of what a lady wants I see she likes me by her wishes to turn me out  Aside  But Madam to promote an emulsive dormitory or as Celsus says a nice bit of sleep or rest nothing equal to a simple goss lettice  Louisa  Thank ye Doctor but I don't need soporisics  Grig  Soap Dem this barber how all my patients will be slapping suds in my teethbut she must be some great heiress here incog by her having dispersed so much money through the village  aside  Louisa  Sir I wish you a good morning  Grig  Rest the nurse of disease

understand that Mrs Allbut is haughty and overbearingthat Mr Allbut puffed up with the pride of riches is the great despot of the villagethat all their wealth really belongs to a poor widow Mrs Bellevue that lives in the cottage by the warren yonder but if Mrs Allbut is so proud I must only temporize into humility Doctor Grigsby's behaviour has convinced me that I shou'd use every exertion to keep myself above pecuniary obligations A pity it is not so but when destitute of particular defence  and protection the world shou'd be guardians to a lone and helpless woman  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Chamber in  Allbut's  House  Enter  Willows  and  Maria  Will  There the instrument's open  Points to a piano forte  Maria  But Mr and Mrs Allbut may return and if she finds me at it  Will  My dear child if you don't practise you'll lose your music and that will be a pity Maria considering the proficiency you made in it  Maria  Ah father my attempt now to retain any elegant accomplishment is but vanity What might have been receiv'd with indulgence when we were in easy circumstances in our present humble situation at best will be overlooked or most likely made the object of ridicule  Will  Why indeed my Love this reverse of fortune comes with a double severity when it subjects us to the insults of this purseproud mean and illiberal Mr and Mrs Allbut Come my dearthere if your lady shou'd hear you I don't think she can be offendedSince I am Mr Allbut's clerk I must to my business in the coumptinghouse  Exit  Maria  I have little heart but as my father thinks it an object I will

to oblige you Master Jack how cou'd you go to turn that poor woman and children from the door yesterday when I desired her to wait while I stept in to bring her something  Mast J  Why 'twas Mamma herself She was reading in the front parlour that poem about humanity and just as her heart and her eyes were melting with the tender pathos of sorrow as she calls it the poor hungry brats set up such a pipingso discomposed Mamma's fine nerves already unstrung by pity that she flew out like an angry turkey and drove the mother and her infants all out of the courtyard Do  play  Maria plays Master Jack interrupting  Molly ha ha ha Don't you think Mamma very silly to go and set Papa too at making poesies and now he begins to trouble the house  Maria  True and all his idea of poetry is making a jingle of rhyme no matter for measure time place or reasonbut if you will hear me play now hold your tongue  Plays  Enter  Mrs Allbut  reading  Mrs A  My servant maid at my instrument  Mast J  What a pretty hornpipe  Maria  You've an excellent ear  Mast J  Yes I've a fine ear for hearing  Mrs A  And feeling  pulls him Maria starts up  Mast J  Now Mama what's that for  Mrs A  Oh enchanting powers

youshe tickles it so lightly with her little finger but you thump it down with your fists as if you were breaking biscuitsthen she sits so quietsit Mollyand here Mamma you go wagging your head about

Writes poetry Here's a saucy slut  aside  What my Ariosto Heavens if she hasn't been pulling my books out of my studyPerhaps we've a Sappho in the house and don't know itI dare say you have the assurance to be full of tender sentiment and sensibility  Maria  No Ma'amyou can't think I've any feeling  Mrs A  Upon my honor she fancies herself a young lady  Mast J  Well Mamma all the village calls her Miss Maria  Mrs A  Miss ha ha haOh I shall faintthe MariaHadn't you better at once call yourself Laura Maria there's my son that will have a tolerable fortune he's call'd by every body plain

and your rubbish  All  Yes but when my head is stuck up in poet's corner there will be rubbish  Mrs A  Mr Allbut you're a brewer mind your malt and your hops  All  Oh you unreasonable woman when it was you that set me on and made me even lay out six shillings at the stall at the corner of Chancerylane for Bushe's Art of Poetry and only to get myself ready at versifications  Mrs A  Yes but Mr Allbut having travell'd all over Italy in the first circles of fashion I had hopes you might turn out a poet of natureto run extempore with a string of beautiful verses on every occasion as it may offer like the charming Italian Improvisatore  All  Well I'm the great English Improvisitory  Mrs A  I have heard the harmonious Metastasio the Pastor Fido the Goldoni  All  On his poney  Mrs A  I protest to heaven if you don'tA pretty thing I can't go to take an airing in my chariot to inhale the balmy odours of the roseate spring but my maid comes with her steps stately into my drawingroom and with her delicate paws rattles my instrument out of tune This  accounts for your negligenceletting me go to the play only t'other night without a pockethandkerchief and when all the boxes were in tears for the sorrows of Yarico I was obliged to wipe my sympathizing moistened cheek in  All  Cheek Ay that was so rosycolour'd that night hussey your lady was fain to twitch the tears from off it with her white kidgloves so that the finger and thumb look'd as if she had been taking brazil snuffthat cou'dn't save some drops falling on your neckhandkerchief what with that and your grievous face my love the titter went round One lord with a blue ribbon whispered "by the heavens that lady sitting next to the pretty wellbehaved little gentleman is Maudlin Muzzy  Jack laughs  Mrs A  enraged

has seen better daystho' now he totally depends upon our humanity  Will  Why Sir as Madam observes one of the men in the brewery might as well do thisI have sufficient use for my time over your books  Maria  Besides Sir consider my father's yearsindeed he hasn't strength  Exit Willows  Mast J  Molly "rattle up the Piano"'twill make us all merry  Mrs A  No Miss you sha'n't show off your graces to entrap the affections of my child  Maria  I can bear all this but to witness the injurious treatment my father receives wounds me to the soul  Exit  Masi J  Ecod I'll go after and kiss Molly's tears

under my roof  looking out  All  Gad 'tis widow Bellevuebut love our roos would still be her's but for my prudent dexterity in tricking her out of it While her husband my old master lived he was sharp

That slut Maria tho' we pay handsomely for poor's rates to bring the paupers out of the roads and hovels  All  Ay Mrs Bellevue's a poor pauper in the hovel now yet she was once too grand to have her great name posted in ledgersno she must have the business carried on under my firm so rather than hurt her dignity my little bit of an insignificant name sneak'd into the lease glided into the consols stole into the East India stock and my little bit of a self popp'd into her house and landlike the New Church in the Strand  Mrs A  Yes it's certainly Maria encourages her to come here I dare say I'm

Sir Henry since sent to you  Mrs Bell  No my Love he's no more a brother His late acquisition of a baronet's title which he never expected has rais'd him so much above me that I'm now out of sightevery spark of fraternal affection even compassion for my sufferings has been long extinguished  Maria  Oh Madam I'm out of all patience with him his family pride so provokingly unreasonableto take such a vast alarm at your marrying a tradesman when he himself tho' a baronet is still in businessyour husband was a brewer your proud brother is a bankerand where the end is money I can't see any great difference in the means us'd to acquire it  Mrs Bell  Candour shou'd in some measure incline me to excuse my brother when I reflect that my present destitute situation is partly the consequence of that very family pride which in his conduct to me wears the appearance of crueltyof inhumanity  Maria  Aye Madam on the sudden death of your worthy husband what a pity that you cou'dn't suppress your own ideas of rank and birth by being above all concern for the bus'ness in trusting it into the hands of this designing fool this knavish Mr Allbut  Mrs Bell  A villainHe abus'd my considenceI plac'd him in a trustand then instead of clearing to puzzle and perplex  Maria  His purpose was to get all into his own power  Mrs Bell  He has done itpossess'd himself of my fortune

mind  Mrs Bell  My kind Mariain the bud of years yet bloom of discretionhad I then such an early friend but those whom misfortune has doom'd to participate in friendship only by receiving may seem interested for a grateful mention of its sacred blessings I am pooryou have been good to meif I thank you you will do justice to my intention  Maria  Don't grieve Madam  Mrs Bell  I didn't know the worth of your mind when my son set the just value upon your person and accomplishmentsHe could discern genuine merit I was dazzled with the blaze of transitory riches and when I should have bless'd him with a real treasure I wrong'd both him and youForbid your union and to prevent it for ever sent my child over seas farfar from me Perhaps now a wand'ring fugitive Oh I have been wicked cruel unnatural I'm punish'd but not enoughI should be resign'dI am  Maria  Dear Madam all will be betterNo news yet of your William  Mrs Bell  No my dear and since the unhappy change of affairs I scarce wish for my sonI have now no home to receive himno smile of welcomemy blessing and my tears are all I've lest to give him  Maria  As my brother Charles was led to go abroad merely with the hopes of finding your William they may have met the two boys were here exemplary in their friendshipthey may they will afford mutual assistance should either want it  Mrs Bell  There too from my unworthy conduct you and your father are now deprived of comfort and protection from a brother and a son Was Charles here the Allbuts dare not treat you as they do But I know nothing of William since his quitting the captain that I sent him with and proceeding by himself to the EastIndies My Boy has a relation there in powerbut no accounts from him  Maria  My father and I remain in the same uncertainty You'll stay and take some refreshment  Mrs Bell  Excuse me my dearI'll not be the cause of drawing Mrs Allbut's displeasure upon you  Maria  She never wants a cause for that Step into my roomI've had a trifling present from some friends in townI must beg your acceptance of a part of it  Mrs Bell  You've too much concern for meI gave you evil and you return every good  Maria  My dear

the rich man be proud only of his power to be the poor man's friend  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Written and spoken by Mrs ESTEN  THE World in a VillageLord help the silly man  Where could he stumble on such an old fashion'd plan  Here's a fine Lady for me exhausting her store  In discharging of debts and relieving the poor  And instead among Bucks of making a racket  Falls in love with a swain oh faugh in a jacket  The Lover too rich young without one tonish vice  No racing no betting no intriguing no dice  The World in a VillageI declare I'd as soon  Expect natural traits from a World in the Moon  Well if they give me such parts I'll so it manage  Commence an Authoress myself and write for the Stage  The World in a Village 'tis the World in a Town  That's your sort that's the go and 'faith I'll write 'em down  Give to the Poor  'Tis what Ladies in high life can't afford to do  They have Dress Equipage Balls Concerts Pharo Loo  Debts Duns and Fees for every secret Billetdoux  Lady Fanny Dawdle just risen from her down bed  In the hard talk of nicely blending white and red  Glancing her languid eyes from the dear glass a minute  Cries "Betty unfold that papersee what's in it"  "Yes my Lady  "It's a petition Mem from a poor soldier's wife  "Laying in of twins Mem just as he lost his life"  "Bless me Betty this freckle spoils every feature  "I'm vastly sorry I can't serve the poor creature  "I've too much feeling for an income so small  "Don't forget Lady Froth's ticket for my grand Ball"  Then the men oh they are precious niddy noddies  With their throats tied up false calves and taper bodies  Pert men at seventeen insolvents at twenty  At twentyfive invalidsold men at thirty  Here's dashing Dick Squanders the great Nabob's rich heir  With cash at his banker's and ten thousand a year  Would he his associates of fashion disgrace  By rememb'ring a friend with a sorrowful face  No demme not he he's up to all that there gig  Know a poor friendOh curse it that's a pretty rig  But one likeness I own is successfully taken  A likeness so strong it cannot be mistaken  In the true British sailor how often we meet  Generosity's homeLiberality's seat  Who tho' hardy humane if improvident just  Ever constant in love ever true to his trust  Who invites the unhappy to share in his mess  Who ne'er turn'd his back on a friend in distress  Who 'midst danger and death will courageously sing  May our arms be victorious and long live the King
