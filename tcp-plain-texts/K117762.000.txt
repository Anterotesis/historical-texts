nature peevish and lazy she woul  now and then slight her work and when her mothe  was very unreasonable she was too apt to retu  her a saucy answer but when she became a  quainted with her own heart and with the scripture  these evil tempers were in a good measure subdue  for she now learnt to imitate not her violent mother but  him who was meek and lowly  When sh  was scolded for doing ill she prayed for grace t  do better and the only answer she made to he  mother's charge "that religion only served t  make people lazy" was to strive to do twice a  much work in order to prove that it really mad  them diligent The only thing in which she ve  tured to disobey her mother was that when she o  dered her to do weekdays work on a Sunday Hester cried and said "she did not dare disobe  God" but to show that she did not wish to sa  her own labour she would do a double portion work on the Saturday night and rise two hour earlier on the Monday morning  Once when she had worked very hard her mother told her she would treat her with a holid  the following Sabbath and take her a fine walk eat cakes and drink ale at Weston fair whi  though it was professed to be kept on the Monda  yet to the disgrace of the village always began  the Sunday evening  This practice is too common It is much to be wished that magistrates would put a stop to it as Mr Simpson did at Weston at the request of Mrs Jones There is another great evil worth the notice of Justices In many villages during the fair ale is sold at private houses which have no  icence to the great injury of sobriety and good morals  Rebecca who would on no account have wasted the Monday which was a working day in idleness and pleasure thought she had a very good right to enjoy herself at the fair on the Sunday evening as well as to take her children Hester earnestly begged to be lest at home and her mother in a rage went without her A wet walk and more ale than she was used to drink gave Rebecca a dangerous fever during this illness Hester who would not follow her to a scene of dissolute mirth attended her night and day and denied herself necessaries that her sick mother might have comforts And though she secretly prayed to God that this sickness might change her mother's heart yet she never once reproached her or pat her in mind that it was caught by indulging in a sinful pleasure Another Sunday night her father told Hester he thought she had been at school long enough for him to have a little good of her learning so he desired she would stay at home and read to him Hester cheerfully ran and fetched her Testament But John fell a laughing called her a fool and said "it would be time enough to read the Testament to him when he was going to die but at present he must have something merry" So saying he gave her a songbook which he had picked up at the Bell Hester having cast her eyes  over it refused to read it saying "she did not dare offend God by reading what would hurt her own soul" John called her a canting hypocrite and said he would put the Testament in the fire for that there was not a more merry girl than she was before she became religious Her mother for once took her part not because she thought her daughter in the right but because she was glad of any pretence to shew her husband was in the wrong though she herself would have abused Hester for the same thing if John had taken her part John with a shocking oath abused them both and went off in a violent passion Hester instead of saying one undutiful word against her father took up a Psalter in order to teach her little sisters but Rebecca was so provoked at her for not joining her in her abuse of her husband that she changed her humour said John was in the right and Hester a perverse hypocrite who only made religion a pretence for being undutiful to her parents Hester bore all in silence and committed her cause to him who judgeth righteously It would have been a great comfort to her if she had dared to go and open her heart to Mrs Crew and to have joined in the religious exercises of the evening at school But her mother refused to let her saying it would only harden her heart in mischief Hester said not a word but after having put the little ones to bed and heard them say their prayers but of sight she went and sat down in her own little loft and said to herself "it would be pleasant to me to have taught my little sisters to read I thought it was my duty for David has saidâ–ª  Come ye children hearken unto me I will teach you the fear of the Lord  I would have been still more pleasant to have passe  the evening at school because I am still ignorant and fitter to learn than to teach but I cannot do either without flying in the face of my mother God sees fit tonight to change my pleasant duties into a painful trial I give up my will and I submit to the will of my father but when he orders me to commit a known sin then I dare not do it because in so doing I must disobey my father which is in heaven" Now it so fell out that this dispute happened on the very Sunday next before Mrs Jones's yearly feast On Mayday all the school attended her to church each in a stuff gown of their own earning and a cap and white apron of her giving After church there was an examination made into the learning and behaviour of the schools those who were most perfect in their chapters and brought the best character for industry humility and sobriety received a Bible or some other good book"  Now Hester had been a whole year hoarding up her little savings in order to be ready with a new gown on the Mayday feast She had never got less than two shillings a week by her spinning besides working for the family and earning a trifle by odd jobs This money she faithfully carried to her mother every Saturday night keeping back by consent only twopence a week towards the gown The sum was compleat the pattern had long been settled and Hester had only on the Monday morning to go to the shop pay her money and bring home her gown to be made Her mother happened to go out that morning early to iron in a gentleman's family where she usually staid a day or two and Hester was busy putting the house in order before she went to the shop  On that very Monday there was to be a meeting at the Bell of all the idle fellows in the parish John Wilmot of course was to be there Indeed he had accepted a challenge of the Blacksmith to a batch at allfours The Blacksmith was flush of money John thought himself the best player and that he might make sure of winning he resolved to keep himself sober which he knew was more than the other would do John was so used to go upon tick for ale that he got to the door of the Bell before he recollected that he could not keep his word with the gambler without money and he had not a penny in his pocket so he sullenly turned homewards He dared not apply to his wife as he knew he should be more likely to get a scratched face than a sixpence from her but he knew that Hester had received two shillings for her last week's spinning on Saturday and perhaps she might not yet have given it to her mother Of the hoarded sum he knew nothing He asked her if she could lend him half a crown and he would pay her next day Hester pleased to see him in goodhumour after what had passed the night before ran up and fetched down her little box and in the joy of her heart that he now desired something she could comply with out wounding her conscience cheerfully poured out her whole little stock upon the table John was in raptures at the sight of three half crown and a sixpence and eagerly seized it box and all together with a few hoarded halfpence at the bottom though he had only asked to borrow half crown None but one whose heart was hardene  by a long course of drunkenness could have take  away the whole and for such a purpose He tol  her she should certainly have it again next morning  and indeed intended to pay it not doubting but he should double the sum But John overrated his own skill or luck for he lost every farthing to the Blacksmith and sneaked home before midnight and quietly walked up tobed He was quite sober which Hester thought a good sign Next morning she asked him in a very humble way for the money which she said she would not have done but that if the gown was not bought directly it would not be ready in time for the feast John's conscience had troubled him a little for what he had done for when he was not drunk he was not illnatured and he stammered out a broken excuse but owned he had lost the money and had not a farthing left The moment Hester saw him mild and kind her heart was softened and she begged him not to vex adding that she would be contented never to have a new gown as long as she lived if she could have the comfort of always seeing him come home as sober as he was last night For Hester did not know that he had refrained from getting drunk only that he might gamble with a better chance of success and that when a gamester keeps himself sober it is not that he may practise a virtue but that he may commit a worse crime "I am indeed sorry for what I have done" said he "you cannot go to the feast and what will Madam Jones say" "Yes but I can" said Hester "for God looks not at the gown but at the heart and I am sure  e sees mine full of gratitude at hearing you talk so kindly and if I thought my dear father would change  is present evil courses I should be the happiest  irl at the feast tomorrow" John walked away mournfully and said to himself "surely there  must be something in religion since it can thus change the heart Hester was a pert girl and now she is as mild as a lamb She was an indolent girl and now she is up with the lark She was a vain girl and would do any thing for a new ribbon and now she is contented to go in rags to a feast at which every one else will have a new gown She deprived herself of her gown to give me the money and yet this very girl so dutiful in some things would submit to be turned out of doors rather than read a loose book at my command or break the Sabbath I do not understand this there must be some mystery in it" All this he said as he was going to work In the evening he did not go to the Bell whether it was owing to his new thoughts or to his not having a penny in his pocket I will not take upon me positively to say but I believe it was a little of one and a little of the other  As the pattern of the intended gown had long been settled in the family and as Hester had the money by her it was looked on as good as bought so that she was trusted to get it brought home and made in her mother's absence Indeed so little did Rebecca care about the school that she would not have cared any thing about the gown if her vanity had not made her wish that her daughter should be the best drest of any girl at the feast Being from home as was said before she knew nothing of the disappointment On Mayday morning Hester instead of keeping from the feast because she had not a new gown or meanly inventing any excuse dressed herself out as neatly as she could in her poor old things and went to join the school in order to go to church Whether Hester had formerly indulged a little pride of heart and talked of this gown rather  too much I am not quite sure certain it is there was a great hue and cry made at seeing Hester Wilmot the neatest girl the most industrious girl in the school come to the Mayday feast in an old stuff gown when every other girl was so creditably drest Indeed I am sorry to say there were two or three much too smart for their station and who had dizened themselves out in very improper finery which Mrs Jones made them take off before her "I mean this feast" said she "as a reward of industry and piety and not as a trial of skill who can be finest and outvie the rest in show If I do not take care my feast will become an encouragement not to virtue but to vanity I am so great a friend to decency of apparel that I even like to see you deny your appetites that you may be able to come decently dressed to the house of God To encourage you to do this I like to set apart this one day of innocent pleasure against which you may be preparing all the year by laying aside something every week towards buying a gown out of your little savings But let me tell you that meekness and an humble spirit is of more value in the sight of God and good men than the gayest cotton gown or the brightest pink ribbon in the parish"  Mrs Jones for all this was as much surprised as  he rest at Hester's mean garb but such is the  ower of a good character that she gave her credit  or right intention especially as she knew the un  appy state of her family For it was Mrs Jones's  ay and it is not a bad way always to wait and  nquire into the truth before she condemned any  ody of good character though appearances were  gainst them "As we cannot judge of people's  otives" said she "we may from ignorance often  condemn their best actions and approve of their worst" "It will be always time enough to judge unfavourably and let us give others credit as long as we can and then we in our turn may expect a a favourable judgment from others" Hester was no more proud of what she had done for her father than she was humbled by the meanness of her garb and though Betty Stiles one of the girls whose finery had been taken away sneered at her Hester never offered to clear herself by exposing her father though she thought it right secretly to inform Mrs Jones of what had past When the examination of the girls began Betty Stiles was asked some questions on the fourth and fifth commandments which she answered very well Hester was asked nearly the same questions and though she answered them no better than Betty had done they were all surprised to see Mrs Jones rise up and give a handsome Bible to Hester while she gave nothing to Betty This girl cried out rather pertly "Madam it is very hard that I have no book I was as perfect as Hester" "I have often told you" said Mrs Jones "that religion is not a thing of the tongue but of the heart That girl gives me the best proof that she has learned the fourth commandment to good purpose who persists in keeping holy the Sabbathday though commanded to break it by a parent whom she loves And that girl best proves that she keeps the fifth who gives up her own comfort and cloathing and credit to honour and obey her father and mother even though they are not such as she could wish Betty Stiles though she could answer the questions so readily went anutting last Sunday when she should have  been at school and refused to nurse her sick mother when she could not help herself"  Farmer Hoskins who stood by whispered to Mrs Jones "Well Madam now you have convinced even me of the benefit of religious instruction now I see there is a meaning to it I thought it was in at one ear and out at the other and that a song was as well as a psalm but now I have found the proof of the pudding is in the eating I see your scholars must  do  what they  hear  and  obey  what they  learn  Why at this rate they will all be the better servants for being really godly and so I will add a pudding to next year's feast"  The pleasure Hester felt in receiving a new Bible made her forget that she had on an old gown She walked to church in a thankful frame but how great was her joy when she saw among a number of working men her own father going into church As she past by him she cast on him a look of so much joy and affection that it brought tears into his eyes especially when he compared her mean dress with that of the other girls and thought who had been the cause of it John who had not been at church for some years was deeply struck with the service The confession with which it opens went to his heart He felt for the first time that he was "a miserable sinner and that there was no health in him" He now felt compunction for sin in general though it was only his ill behaviour to his daughter which had brought him to church The sermon was such as served to strengthen the impression which the prayers had made and when it was over instead of joining the ringers for the belfry was the only part of the church John liked because it usually led to the  alehouse he quietly walked back to his work It was indeed the best day's work he ever made He could not get out of his head the whole day the first words he had heard at church "When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness and doth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive" At night instead of going to the Bell he went home intending to ask Hester to forgive him but as soon as he got to the door he heard Rebecca rating his daughter for having brought such a disgrace on the family as to be seen in that old rag of a gown and insisted on knowing what she had done with the money Hester tried to keep the secret but her mother declared she would turn her out of doors if she did not tell the truth Hester was at last forced to confess she had given it to her father Unfortunately for poor John it was at this very moment he opened the door The mother now divided her fury between her guilty husband and her innocent child till from words she fell to blows John defended his daughter and received some of the strokes intended for the poor girl This turbulent scene partly put John's good resolutions to slight though the patience of Hester did him almost as much good as the sermon he had heard At length the poor girl escaped up stairs not a little bruised and a scene of much violence passed between John and Rebecca She declared she would not sit down to supper with such a brute and set off to a neighbour's house that she might have the pleasure of abusing him the longer John whose mind was much disturbed went up stairs without his supper As he was passing by Hester's little room he heard her voice and as he concluded she was  venting bitter complaints against her unnatural parents he stopped to listen resolving to go in and comfort her He stopped at the door for by the light of the moon he saw her kneeling by her bedside and praying so earnestly that she did not hear him As he made sure she could be praying for nothing but his death what was his surprise to hear these words "O Lord have mercy upon my dear father and mother teach me to love them to pray for them and do them good make me more dutiful and more patient that adorning the doctrine of God my Saviour I may recommend his holy religion and my dear parents may be brought to love and fear thee"  Poor John who would never have been hard hearted if he had not been a drunkard could not stand this he fell down on his knees embraced his child and begged her to teach him how to pray He prayed himself as well as he could and though he did not know what words to use yet his heart was melted he owned he was a sinner and begged Hester to fetch the prayer book and read over the confession with which he had been so struck at church This was the pleasantest order she had ever obeyed Seeing him deeply affected with a sense of sin she pointed out to him the Saviour of sinners and in this manner she past some hours with her father which were the happiest of her life such a night was worth a hundred cotton or even silk gowns In the course of the week Hester read over the confession and some other prayers to her father so often that he got them by heart and repeated them while he was at work And at length he took courage to kneel down and pray before he went to bed From that time he  bore his wife's illhumour much better than he had ever done and as he knew her to be neat and notable and saving he began to think that if her temper was not quite so bad his home might still become as pleasant a place to him as ever the Bell had been but unless she became more tractable he did not know what to do with his long evenings after the little ones were in bed for he began once more to delight in playing with them Hester proposed that she should teach him to read an hour every night and he consented Rebecca began to storm from the mere trick she had got of storming but finding that he now brought home all his earnings and that she got both his money and his company for she had once loved him she began to reconcile herself to this new way of life In a few months John could read a psalm in learning to read it he also got it by heart and this proved a little store for private devotion and while he was mowing he could call to mind a text to chee  his labour He now went constantly to church and often dropped in at the school on a Sunday evening to hear their prayers He expressed  much pleasure at this that one day Hester ventured to ask him if they should set up family prayer at home John said he should like mightily but as he could not yet read quite we enough he desired Hester to try to get a prop  book and begin next Sunday night Hester ha  bought of a pious Hawker for threehalfpence the Book of Prayers printed for the Cheap Repo  tory by Mr Marshall QueenStreet Cheapside  These prayers may be had also divided into two par  one fit for private persons the other for families price o  halfpenny  When Hester read the exhortation at the beginning of this little book her mother who sat in the corner and pretended to be asleep was so much struck that she could not find a word to say against it For a few nights indeed she continued to sit still or pretended to rock the young child while her husband and daughter were kneeling at their prayers She expected John would have scolded her for this and so perverse was her temper that she was disappointed at his finding no fault with her Seeing at last that he was very patient and that though he prayed fervently himself he suffered her to do as she liked she lost the spirit of opposition for want of something to provoke it As her pride began to be subdued some little disposition to piety was awakened in her heart By degrees she slid down on her knees though at first it was behind the cradle or the clock or in some corner where she thought they would not see her Hester rejoiced even in this outward change in her mother and prayed that God would at last be pleased to touch her heart as he had done that of her father  As John now spent no idle money he had saved up a trifle by working overhours this he kindly offered to Hester to make up for the loss of her gown Instead of accepting it Hester told him that as she herself was young and healthy she should soon be able to clothe herself out of her own savings and begged him to make her mother a present of this gown which he did It had been a maxim of Rebecca that it was better not go to Church at all than go in an old gown She had however so far conquered this evil notion that she had lately  gone pretty often This kindness of the gown touched her not a little and the first Sunday she put it on Mr Simpson happened to preach from this text "God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble" This sermon so affected Rebecca that she never once thought she had her new gown on till she came to take it off when she went tobed and that very night instead of skulking behind she knelt down by her husband  There was one thing sunk deep in Rebecca's mind she had observed that since her husband had grown religious he bad been so careful not to give her any offence that he was become scrupulously clean took off his dirty shoes before he sat down and was very cautious not to spill a drop of bee  on her shining table Now it was rather remarkable that as John grew more neat Rebecca grew more indifferent to neatness But both these change arose from the same cause the growth of religio  in their hearts John grew cleanly from the  ea  of giving pain to his wife while Rebecca grew in different from having discovered the sin and vani  of an over anxious care about trifles  Hester continues to grow in grace and in knowledge Last christmasday she was appointed a  under teacher in the school and many people think that some years hence if any thing should happe  to Mrs Crew Hester may be promoted to be hea  mistress  Z  THE END
