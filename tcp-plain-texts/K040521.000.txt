 THE GHOST BY C CHURCHILL BOOK III  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR and Sold by WILLIAM FLEXNEY near Gray'sInn Gate Holborn MDCCLXII  THE GHOST BOOK III  _IT WAS THE HOUR when  Huswife Morn  With  Pearl  and  Linnen  hangs each thorn  When happy Bards who can regale  Their Muse with Country air and ale  Ramble afield to Brooks and Bow'rs  To pick up  Sentiments  and  Flow'rs    When Dogs and Squires from kennel fly  And Hogs and Farmers quit their stye  When  my Lord  rises to the Chace  And brawny Chaplain takes his place  THESE Images or bad or good  If they are rightly understood  Sagacious  Readers must allow  Proclaim us in the Country now  For Observations mostly rise  From Objects just before our eyes  And ev'ry Lord in Critic Wit  Can tell you where the piece was writ  Can point out as he goes along  And who shall dare to say he's wrong  Whether the warmth for Bards we know  At present never more than glow  Was in the Town or Country caught  By the peculiar turn of thought  IT WAS THE HOURtho' Critics frown  We now declare ourselves in Town  Nor will a moment's pause allow  For finding when he came or how  The Man who deals in humble Prose  Tied down by rule and method goes  But they who court the vig'rous Muse  Their carriage have a right to chuse  Free as the Air and unconfin'd  Swift as the motions of the Mind  The POET darts from place to place  And instant bounds o'er Time and Space  Nature whilst blended fire and skill  Inflame our passions to his will  Smiles at her violated Laws  And crowns his daring with applause  SHOULD there be still some rigid few  Who keep  propriety  in view  Whose heads turn round and cannot bear  This whirling passage thro' the Air  Free leave have such at home to sit  And write a  Regimen  for Wit  To clip our Pinions let them try  Not having heart themselves to fly  IT WAS THE HOUR when Devotees  Breathe  pious curses  on their knees  When they with pray'rs the day begin  To sanctify a Night of Sin  When Rogues of Modesty who roam  Under the veil of Night sneak home  That free from all restraint and awe  Just to the windward of the Law  Less modest Rogues their tricks may play  And plunder in the face of day  BUT holdwhilst thus we play the fool  In bold contempt of ev'ry rule  Things of no consequence expressing  Describing  now and now  digressing    To the discredit of our skill  The main concern is standing still  IN  Plays  indeed when storms of rage  Tempestuous in the Soul engage  Or when the Spirits weak and low  Are sunk in deep distress and woe  With strict Propriety we hear  DESCRIPTION stealing on the ear  And put off feeling half an hour  To  thatch a cot  or  paint a flow'r    But in these  serious  works design'd  To mend the morals of Mankind  We must for ever be disgrac'd  With ev'ry nicer son of Taste  If once the Shadow to pursue  We let the Substance out of view  Our  means must uniformly tend  In due proportion to their end  And ev'ry passage aptly join  To bring about the  one  design  Our Friends themselves cannot admit  This rambling wild digressive Wit  Nonot those very Friends who found  Their Credit on the selfsame ground  PEACE my good grumbling Sirfor once  Sunk in the solemn formal Dunce  This Coxcomb shall your fears beguile  We will be dullthat you may smile  COME METHOD come in all thy pride  DULLNESS and WHITEHEAD by thy side  DULLNESS and METHOD still are one  And WHITEHEAD is their darling Son  Not HE whose pen above controul  Struck terror to the guilty Soul  Made Folly tremble thro' her state  And Villains blush at being Great  But HE who in the Laureat Chair  By Grace not Merit planted there  In aukward pomp is seen to sit  And by his  Patent  proves his Wit  For favours of the Great we know  Can Wit as well as rank bestow  And they who without one pretension  Can get for Fools a place or pension  Must able be suppos'd of course  If reason is allow'd due force  To give such qualities and grace  As may equip them for the place  BUT HEwho measures as he goes  A mongril kind of tinkling prose  And is too frugal to dispense  At once both Poetry and Sense  Who from amidst his  slumb'ring  guards  Deals out a Charge to  Subject Bards    Where Couplets after Couplets creep  Propitious to the reign of sleep  Yet ev'ry word imprints an awe  And all his dictates pass for law  With BEAUX who simper all around  And BELLES who die in ev'ry sound  For in all things of this relation  Men mostly judge from  situation    Nor in a thousand find we one  Who really weighs what's said or done  They deal out Censure or give Credit  Merely from him who did or said it  BUT HEwho  happily serene    Means nothing yet would seem to mean  Who rules and cautions can dispense  With all that humble insolence  Which Impudence in vain would teach  And none but  modest  men can reach  Who adds to SENTIMENTS the grace  Of always being out of place  And  drawls  out MORALS with an air  A Gentleman would blush to wear  Who on the  chastest simplest  plan  As  Chaste  as  simple  as the Man  Without or  Character  or  Plot    NATURE unknown and ART forgot  Can with much racking of the brains  And years consum'd in letter'd pains  An heap of words together lay  And smirking call the thing a Play  Who Champion sworn in Virtue's cause  'Gainst Vice his  tiny bodkin  draws  But to no part of  Prudence  stranger  First blunts the point for fear of danger  So Nurses sage as Caution works  When Children first use knives and forks  For fear of mischief it is known  To others fingers or their own  To take the edge off wisely chuse  Tho' the same stroke takes off the use  THEE WHITEHEAD Thee I now invoke  Sworn foe to Satyr's gen'rous stroke  Which makes unwilling Conscience feel  And wounds but only wounds to heal  Goodnatur'd easy Creature mild  And gentle as a newborn Child  Thy  heart  would never once admit  E'en  wholesome  rigour to thy Wit  Thy  head  if Conscience should comply  Its kind assistance would deny  And lend thee neither force nor art  To drive it onward to the heart  O may thy sacred pow'r controul  Each fiercer working of my soul  Damp ev'ry spark of genuine fire  And languors like thine own inspire  Trite be each Thought and ev'ry Line  As  Moral  and as  Dull  as THINE  POIS'D in midairit matters not  To ascertain the very spot  Nor yet to give you a relation  How it eluded  Gravitation    Hung a  WatchTow'r  by VULCAN plan'd  With such rare skill by JOVE's Command  That ev'ry word which whisper'd here  Scarce vibrates to the neighbour ear  On the still bosom of the Air  Is borne and heard distinctly there  The Palace of an antient Dame  Whom Men as well as Gods call FAME  A  prattling Gossip  on whose tongue  Proof of perpetual motion's hung  Whose lungs in strength all lungs surpass  Like her own Trumpet made of brass  Who with an hundred pair of eyes  The vain attacks of sleep defies  Who with an hundred pair of wings  News from the farthest quarters brings  Sees hears and tells untold before  All that she knows and ten times more  NOT all the Virtues which we find  Concenter'd in a HUNTER's mind  Can make her spare the ranc'rous tale  If in one point she chance to fail  Or if once in a thousand years  A perfect Character appears  Such as of late with joy and pride  My Soul possess'd e're A died  Or such as Envy must allow  The World enjoys in H now  This Hag who aims at all alike  At Virtues e'en like theirs will strike  And make faults in the way of trade  When she can't find them ready made  ALL things she takes in small and great  Talks of a  Toyshop  and a  State    Of  Wits  and  Fools  of  Saints  and  Kings    Of  Garters Stars  and  LeadingStrings    Of  Old Lords fumbling for a Clap    And  Young Ones full of Pray'r and Pap    Of  Courts  of  Morals  and  TyeWigs    Of  Bears  and  Serjeants  dancing jigs  Of  Grave Professors  at the  Bar  Learning to  thrum  on the  Guittar    Whilst Laws are  slubber'd  o'er in haste  And  Judgment  sacrific'd to TASTE  Of  whited Sepulchres Lawn Sleeves    And GOD's  house  made a  den of thieves    Of  Fun'ral pomps  where Clamours hung  And fix'd disgrace on ev'ry tongue  Whilst SENSE and ORDER blush'd to see  Nobles  without HUMANITY  Of  Coronations  where each heart  With honest raptures bore a part  Of  City Feasts  where ELEGANCE  Was proud her Colours to advance  And GLUTTONY uncommon case  Could only get the second place  Of  Newrais'd  Pillars in the State  Who must be good as being great  Of  Shoulders  on which HONOURS sit  Almost as clumsily as  Wit    Of  doughty Knights  whom  titles  please  But not the payment of the  Fees    Of  Lectures  whither ev'ry Fool  In  second childhood  goes to school  Of  grey Beards  deaf to Reason's call  From  Inn of Court  or  City Hall    Whom youthful Appetites enslave  With one Foot fairly in the grave  By help of Crutch a needful Brother  Learning of HART to dance with t'other  Of  Doctors regularly bred  To fill the mansions of the dead  Of  Quacks  for Quacks they must be still  Who save when FORMS require to kill  Who life and health and vigour give  To HIM not one would wish to live  Of  Artists  who with noblest view  Disinterested plans pursue  For trembling worth the ladder raise  And mark out the ascent to praise  Of  Arts  and  Sciences  where meet  Sublime Profound  and  all compleat    A SET whom at some fitter time  The MUSE shall  consecrate  in  Rhime  Who  humble  ARTISTS to out do  A far more  lib'ral  plan pursue  And let their  welljudg'd  PREMIUMS fall  On Those who have no worth at all  Of  SignPost Exhibitions  rais'd  For laughter more than to be prais'd  Tho' by the way we cannot see  Why  Praise  and  Laughter  mayn't agree  Where  genuine  HUMOUR runs to waste  And justly chides our want of Taste  Censur'd like other things tho' good  Because they are not understood  To higher subjects now SHE soars  And talks of  Politics  and  Whores    If to your nice and chaster ears  That Term  indelicate  appears  SCRIPTURE  politely  shall refine  And melt It into  Concubine  In the same breath spreads BOURBON's  league    And publishes the  Grand Intrigue    In BRUSSELS or  our own  GAZETTE  Makes armies fight which never met  And circulates the Pox or Plague  To LONDON by the way of HAGUE  For all the lies which there appear  Stamp'd with  Authority  come here  Borrows as freely from the gabble  Of some rude leader of a rabble  Or from the  quaint  harangues of those  Who lead a Nation by the Nose  As from those  storms  which void of Art  Burst from our  honest  PATRIOT's heart  When ELOQUENCE and VIRTUE late  Remark'd to live in mutual hate  Fond of each other's Friendship grown  Claim ev'ry sentence for their own  And with an equal joy recites  Parade Amours  and  halfpay Fights    Perform'd by  Heroes  of  fair Weather    Merely by dint of  Lace  and  Feather    As those rare acts which HONOUR taught  Our daring Sons where GRANBY fought  Or those which with superior skill  atchiev'd by  standing still    THIS HAG the curious if they please  May search from earliest Times to these  And POETS they will always see  With  Gods  and  Goddesses  make free  Treating them all except the MUSE  As scarcely fit to wipe their shoes  Who had beheld from first to last  How our TRIUMVIRATE had pass'd  Night's dreadful interval and heard  With strict attention ev'ry word  Soon as she saw return of light  On sounding pinions took her flight  SWIFT thro' the regions of the sky  Above the reach of human eye  Onward she drove the furious blast  And rapid as a whirlwind past  O'er  Countries  once the seats of  Taste    By Time and Ignorance laid waste  O'er lands where former ages saw  Reason  and  Truth  the only Law  Where  Arts  and  Arms  and  Public Love  In gen'rous emulation strove  Where  Kings  were proud of  legal  sway  And Subjects  happy  to obey  Tho' now in slav'ry sunk and broke  To  Superstition's  galling yoke  Of  Arts  of  Arms  no more they tell  Or  Freedom  which with  Science  fell  By Tyrants aw'd who never find  The Passage to their people's mind  To whom the joy was never known  Of planting in the heart their throne  Far from all prospect of relief  Their hours in fruitless pray'rs and grief  For loss of blessings  they  employ  Which WE  unthankfully  enjoy  Now is the time had we the will  T'amaze the Readers with our skill  To pour out such a flood of knowledge  As might suffice for a whole College  Whilst with a true Poetic force  We trac'd the Goddess in her course  Sweetly  describing in our flight  Each  Common  and  Uncommon  Sight  Making our journal gay and pleasant  With things long past and things now present  Rivers  once NYMPHSa  Transformation  Is mighty pretty in Relation  From  great Authorities  we know  Will matter for a  Tale  bestow  To make the observation clear  We give our Friends an instance here  THE DAY that never is forgot  Was  very fine  but  very hot    The NYMPH another gen'ral rule  Enflam'd with heat laid down to cool  Her  Hair  we no exceptions find  Wav'd careless floating in the wind  Her  heaving breasts  like  Summer seas    Seem'd am'rous  of the  playful breeze    Should  fond  DESCRIPTION tune our lays  In  choicest  accents to her praise  DESCRIPTION we at last should find  Baffled and weak would halt behind  NATURE had form'd her to inspire  In ev'ry bosom soft desire  Passions to raise she could not feel  Wounds to inflict she would not heal  A GOD his name is no great matter  Perhaps a JOVE perhaps a SATYR  Raging with  Lust  a GODLIKE flame  By Chance  as usual  thither came  With gloting eyes the Fair one view'd  Desir'd her first and then pursu'd  She  for what other can she do  Must fly or how can He pursue  The  Muse  so Custom hath decreed  Now proves her Spirit by her speed  Nor must one  limping  line disgrace  The life and vigour of the Race  SHE RUNS AND HE RUNS 'till at length  Quite destitute of Breath and strength  To  Heav'n  for there we  all  apply  For help when there's no other nigh  She offers up her  Virgin  Pray'r  Can  Virgins  pray unpitied there  And when the God thinks He has caught her  Slips thro' his hands and runs to water  Becomes a  Stream  in which the POET  If He has any Wit may shew it  A  City  once for Pow'r renown'd  Now levell'd even to the ground  Beyond all doubt is a direction  To introduce some  fine  reflexion  Ah woeful me Ah woeful Man  Ah woeful All do all we can  Who can on earthly things depend  From one to t'other moment's end  HONOUR WIT GENIUS WEALTH and GLORY  Good lack good lack  are transitory  Nothing is sure and stable found  The very  Earth  itself turns round  Monarchs  nay MINISTERS must die  Must  rot  must  stinkAh me ah why  Cities  themselves in Time decay  If  Cities  thus  Ah welladay  If  Brick  and  Mortar  have an end  On what can  Flesh  and  Blood  depend  Ah woeful me Ah woeful Man  Ah woeful All do All we can  ENGLAND for that's at last the Scene  Tho' Worlds on Worlds should rise between  Whither we must our course pursue  ENGLAND should call into review  Times long since past indeed but not  By ENGLISHMEN to be forgot  Tho' ENGLAND  once  so dear to Fame  Sinks in GREAT BRITAIN's  dearer  name  HERE could we mention  Chiefs of old    In plain and rugged honour bold  To Virtue kind to Vice severe  Strangers to Bribery and Fear  Who kept no wretched  Clans  in awe  Who never broke or  warp'd  the Law  Patriots  whom in her  better  days  Old Rome  might have been proud to raise  Who steddy to their Country's claim  Boldly stood up in  Freedom's  name  E'en to the teeth of  Tyrant Pride    And when they could no more THEY DIED  THERE  striking contrast  might we place  A servile mean degen'rate race  Hirelings  who valued nought but gold  By the best Bidder bought and sold  Truants from Honour's sacred Laws  Betrayers of their Country's cause  The Dupes of Party Tools of Pow'r  Slaves to the  Minion of an Hour    Lacquies who watch'd a  Favorite's  nod  And took a  Puppet  for their  God    SINCERE and honest in our Rimes  How might we praise these  happier  times  How might the Muse exalt her lays  And wanton in a Monarch's praise  Tell of a Prince in ENGLAND born  Whose Virtues ENGLAND's crown adorn  In Youth a pattern unto age  So chaste so Pious and so Sage  Who true to all those sacred bands  Which private happiness demands  Yet never let's them rise above  The stronger ties of Public Love  WITH conscious Pride see ENGLAND stand  Our  holy Charter  in her hand  She waves it round and o'er the Isle  See  Liberty  and  Courage  smile  No more she mourns her treasures hurl'd  In  Subsidies  to all the world  No more by foreign threats dismay'd  No more deceiv'd with foreign aid  She deals out Sums to  petty  States  Whom  Honour  scorns and Reason hates  But wiser by Experience grown  Finds safety in herself alone  WHILST thus she cries my children stand  An honest valiant  native  band  A train'd MILITIA brave and free  True to their KING and true to ME  No  foreign  Hirelings shall be known  Nor need we Hirelings of  our own    Under a just and pious reign  The Statesman's sophistry is vain  Vain is each vile corrupt pretence  These are my  natural  defence  Their Faith I know and they shall prove  The Bulwark of the KING they Love  THESE and a thousand things beside  Did we consult a Poet's Pride  Some gay some serious might be said  But ten to one they'd not be read  Or were they by some curious few  Not even those would think them true  For from the time that JUBAL first  Sweet ditties to the harp rehears'd  Poets  have always been suspected  Of having Truth in Rhime neglected  That  Bard  except who from his Youth  Equally fam'd for  Faith  and  Truth    By Prudence taught in  courtly chime    To  Courtly ears  brought  Truth in Rhime    BUT tho' to Poets we allow  No matter when acquir'd or how  From Truth unbounded deviation  Which custom calls  Imagination    Yet can't they be suppos'd to lie  One half so fast as FAME can fly  Therefore to solve this  Gordian  knot  A point we almost had forgot  To courteous Readers be it known  That fond of verse and falshood grown  Whilst we in sweet digression sung  FAME check'd her flight and held her tongue  And now pursues with double force  And double speed her destin'd course  Nor stops 'till She the place arrives  Where GENIUS starves and DULLNESS thrives  Where Riches Virtue are esteem'd  And Craft is truest Wisdom deem'd  Where COMMERCE proudly rears her throne  In state to other Lands unknown  Where to be cheated and to cheat  Strangers from ev'ry quarter meet  Where CHRISTIANS JEWS and TURKS shake hands  United in  Commercial  bands  All of one  Faith  and that to own  No GOD but INTEREST alone  WHEN Gods and Goddesses come down  To look about them here in Town  For Change of Air is understood  By Sons of Physic to be good  In due proportions now and then  For these same Gods as well as Men  By Custom rul'd and not a Poet  So very dull but he must know it  In order to remain  incog    They always travel in a fog  For if we Majesty expose  To vulgar eyes too cheap it grows  The force is lost and free from awe  We spy and censure ev'ry flaw  But well preserv'd from public view  It always breaks forth fresh and new  Fierce as the Sun in all his pride  It shines and not a spot's descried  WAS JOVE to lay his thunder by  And with his brethren of the sky  Descend to earth and frisk about  Like chatt'ring N * * * from rout to rout  He would be found with all his host  A nine days Wonder at the most  Would we in trim our Honours wear  We must preserve them from the air  What is familiar Men neglect  However worthy of

CHANGE exact at seven o'clock  Alighted on the  WeatherCock    Which planted there time out of mind  To note the changes of the wind  Might no improper emblem be  Of her own mutability  THRICE did  She  sound her TRUMP the same  Which from the first belong'd to FAME  An  old illfavour'd  Instrument  With which the Goddess was content  Tho' under a  politer  race  Bagpipes  might well supply its place  And thrice awaken'd by the sound  A gen'ral din prevail'd around  CONFUSION thro' the City past  And FEAR bestrode the dreadful blast  THOSE  fragrant Currents  which we meet  Distilling soft thro' ev'ry street  Affrighted from the usual course  Ran  murm'ring  upwards to their source  Statues  wept tears of blood as fast  As when a CAESAR breath'd his last  Horses which always us'd to go  A  footpace  in my  LordMayor's Shew    Impetuous  from their Stable broke  And ALDERMEN and OXEN spoke  HALLS felt the force  Tow'rs  shook around  And  Steeples  nodded to the ground  ST PAUL

unlike those peaceful notes  That equal harmony which floats  On the dull wing of City air  Grave prelude to a feast or fair  Much did he inly ruminate  Concerning the decrees of Fate  Revolving tho'

sacred name  To those who feel not VIRTUE's flame  Or only feel it at the best  As the dull dupe of  Interest    Whisper'd aloud for this we find  A Custom current with Mankind  So loud to Whisper that each word  May all around be plainly heard  And Prudence sure would never miss  A Custom so contriv'd as this  Her Candour to secure yet aim  Sure Death against another's fame  Knights Lords  and  Dukes  mad wretch forbear  Dangers unthought of ambush there  Confine thy rage to weaker slaves  Laugh at  small Fools  and lash  small Knaves    But never  helpless mean  and  poor    Rush on where Laws cannot secure  Nor think thyself mistaken Youth  Secure in Principles of  Truth    Truth  why shall ev'ry wretch of Letters  Dare to speak  Truth  against his  Betters  Let  ragged  VIRTUE stand aloof  Nor mutter accents of reproof  Let  ragged  WIT a Mute become  When Wealth and Pow'r would have her dumb  For who the Devil doth not know  That Titles and Estates bestow  An ample stock where're they fall  Of Graces which we mental call  Beggars in ev'ry age and nation  Are Rogues and Fools by Situation  The Rich and Great are understood  To be of Course both wise and good  Consult then Int'rest more than Pride  Discreetly take the stronger side  Desert in Time the simple few  Who  Virtue  's barren path pursue  Adopt my maximsfollow Me  To BAAL bow the prudent knee  Deny thy God betray thy Friend  At BAAL's altars hourly bend  So shalt Thou rich and great be seen  To be Great  now  You must be mean  HENCE  Tempter  to some weaker Soul  Which Fear and Interest controul  Vainly thy precepts are address'd  Where VIRTUE steels the steady breast  Through Meanness wade to boasted pow'r  Through Guilt repeated ev'ry hour  What is thy Gain when all is done  What mighty Laurels hast Thou won  Dull Crouds to whom the heart's unknown  Praise Thee for Virtues not thine own  But will at once Man's scourge and friend  Impartial  CONSCIENCE too commend  From her reproaches can'st Thou fly  Can'st Thou with worlds her silence buy  Believe it nother stings shall find  A Passage to thy  Coward  Mind  There shall she fix her sharpest dart  There shew Thee truly  as Thou art    Unknown to those by whom Thou'rt priz'd  Known to Thyself to be despis'd  THE Man who weds the sacred MUSE  Disdains all mercenary views  And He who VIRTUE's throne would rear  Laughs at the Phantoms rais'd by Fear  Tho'  Folly  rob'd in Purple shines  Tho'  Vice  exhausts  Peruvian  mines  Yet shall they tremble and turn pale  When SATIRE wields her mighty Flail  Or should They of rebuke afraid  With M * * * * seek Hell's deepest shade  SATIRE still mindful of her aim  Shall bring the Cowards back to Shame  HATED by many lov'd by few  Above each little private view  Honest tho' poor and who shall dare  To disappoint my boasting there  Hardy and resolute tho' weak  The dictates of my heart to speak  Willing I bend at SATIRE's Throne  What Pow'r I have be all her own  NOR shall yon  Lawyer  's specious art  Conscious of a corrupted heart  Create imaginary Fear  To damp us in our bold Career  Why should we Fear and what the Laws  They all are arm'd in VIRTUE's cause  And aiming at the selfsame end  SATIRE is always VIRTUE's Friend  Nor shall that Muse whose honest rage  In a corrupt degen'rate age  When dead to ev'ry nicer sense  Deep sunk in Vice and Indolence  The Spirit of old ROME was broke  Beneath the  Tyrant Fidler's  yoke  Banish'd the Rose from NERO's cheek  Under a BRUNSWICK fear to speak  DRAWN by  Conceit  from REASON's plan  How vain is that  poor Creature  MAN  How pleas'd is ev'ry paultry elf  To prate about that thing himself  After my Promise made in Rhime  And meant in earnest at that time  To jog according to the Mode  In one dull pace in one dull road  What but that Curse of Heart and Head  To this  digression  could have led  Where plung'd in vain I look about  And can't stay in nor well get out  COULD I whilst  Humor  held the Quill  Could I  digress  with half that skill  Could I with half that skill return  Which we so much admire in STERNE  Where each  Digression  seeming vain  And only fit to entertain  Is found on better recollection  To have a just and nice Connection  To help the whole with wond'rous art  Whence it seems idly to depart  Then should our Readers ne'er accuse  These wild excursions of the Muse  Ne'er backward turn dull Pages o'er  To recollect what went before  Deeply impress'd and ever new  Each Image past should start to view  And We to DULLMAN now come in  As if we ne'er had absent been  HAVE you not seen when danger's near  The coward cheek turn  white  with fear  Have you not seen when danger's fled  The selfsame cheek with joy turn  red  These are  low  symptoms which we find  Fit only for a vulgar mind  Where honest features void of art  Betray the feelings of the heart  Our DULLMAN with a face was bless'd  Where no one passion was express'd  His eye in a  fine stupor  caught  Imply'd a plenteous lack of thought  Nor was one line that whole face seen in  Which could be justly charg'd with meaning  TO AVARICE by  birth  ally'd  Debauch'd by  Marriage  into  Pride    In age grown fond of youthful sports  Of Pomps of Vanities and Courts  And by success too mighty made  To love his Country or his Trade  Stiff in opinion no rare case  With Blockheads in or out of Place  Too weak and insolent of Soul  To suffer Reason's just controul  But bending of his own accord  To that  trim transient toy  MY LORD  The dupe of SCOTS a fatal race  Whom GOD in  wrath  contriv'd to place  To scourge our crimes and gall our pride  A constant thorn in ENGLAND's side  Whom first our greatness to oppose  He in his vengeance mark'd for  foes    Then more to serve his wrathful ends  And  more to curse us  mark'd for  Friends  Deep  in the state if we give credit  To  Him  for no one else e're said it  Sworn friend of great Ones not a few  Tho' he their Titles only knew  And those which envious of his breeding  Bookworms  have charg'd to want of reading  Merely to shew himself polite  He never would pronounce aright  An  Orator  with whom a host  Of those which ROME and ATHENS boast  In all their Pride might not contend  Who with no Pow'rs to recommend  Whilst JACKY HUME and BILLY WHITEHEAD  And DICKY GLOVER sat delighted  Could speak whole days in Nature's spite  Just as those  able Versemen  write  Great DULLMAN from his bed arose  Thrice did he spitthrice wip'd his nose  Thrice strove to smilethrice strove to frown  And thrice look'd upand thrice look'd down  Then Silence brokeCRAPE who am I  CRAPE bow'd and smil'd an arch reply  Am I not CRAPE I am you know  Above all those who are below  Have I not knowledge and for  Wit    Money will always purchase it  Nor if it needful should be found  Will I grudge ten or twenty Pound  For which the whole stock may be bought  Of  scoundrel wits  not worth a Groat  But least I should proceed too far  I'll feel my Friend  the Minister    Great Men CRAPE must not be neglected  How he in this point is affected  For as I stand a magistrate  To serve him first and next the State  Perhaps He may not think it fit  To let  his  magistrates have wit  BOAST I not at this very hour  Those large effects which troop with pow'r  Am I not mighty in the land  Do not I sit whilst others stand  Am I not with rich garments grac'd  In seat of honour always plac'd  And do not  Cits  of chief degree  Tho' proud to others bend to me  HAVE I not as a JUSTICE ought  The laws such wholesome rigor taught  That  Fornication  in disgrace  Is now afraid to shew her face  And not one Whore these walls approaches  Unless They ride in our own coaches  And shall  this  FAME an  old poor  Strumpet  Without our Licence sound her Trumpet  And envious of our City's quiet  In broad Daylight blow up a Riot  If insolence like this we bear  Where is our State our office where  Farewell  all honours of our reign  Farewell  the  Neckenobling  CHAIN  Freedom's  known  badge o'er all the globe  Farewell  the  solemnspreading  ROBE  Farewell  the SWORD  farewell  the MACE  Farewell  all TITLE POMP and PLACE  Remov'd from Men of high degree  A

which greatness love  Which  rule below  but  dwell above    Those Pow'rs united all shall join  To contradict the rash design  SOONER shall stubborn WILL lay down  His opposition with his  Gown    Sooner shall TEMPLE leave the road  Which leads to VIRTUE's  mean  abode  Sooner shall SCOTS this Country quit  And ENGLAND's Foes be Friends to PITT  Than DULLMAN from his grandeur thrown  Shall wander outcast and unknown  SURE as that  Cane  a  Cane  there stood  Near to a  Table  made of  Wood    Of  dry fine  Wood a Table made  By some rare artist in the trade  Who had enjoy'd immortal praise  If he had liv'd in HOMER's days  Sure as that  Cane  which once was seen  In pride of life all fresh and green  The banks of INDUS to adorn  Then  of its leafy honours shorn  According to exactest rule  Was fashion'd by the workman's tool  And which at present we behold  Curiously  polish'd crown'd with  gold    With gold  wellwrought  sure as that  Cane  Shall never on its native plain  Strike root afresh shall never more  Flourish on Tawny INDIA's shore  So sure shall DULLMAN and his race  To latest times this station grace  DULLMAN who all this while had kept  His eyelids clos'd as if He slept  Now looking stedfastly on CRAPE  As at some God in human shape  CRAPE I protest you seem to me  To have discharg'd a Prophecy  Yes  from the first it doth appear  Planted by FATE the DULLMANS  here  Have always held a quiet reign  And  here  shall to the last remain  CRAPE they're all wrong about this  Ghost    Quite on the wrong side of the Post  Blockheads  to take  it  in their head  To be a message from the dead  For that by  Mission  they design  A word not half so good as mine  CRAPE  here  it isstart not one doubt  A  Plot  a  Plot  I've found it out  O GODcries CRAPEhow blest the nation  Where one Son boasts such penetration  CRAPE I've not time to tell you now  When  I discover'd this or  how    To STENTOR goif he's not there  His place let  Bully  NORTON

grateful CRAPE and let Me not  Like  Old  NEWCASTLE be forgot  BUT an Affair CRAPE of this size  Will ask from Conduct vast supplies  It must not as the Vulgar say  Be done in  Hugger Mugger  way  Traitors indeed and that's discreet  Who hatch the Plot in private meet  They should in Public go no doubt  Whose business is to find it out  TOMORROWif the day appear  Likely to turn out fair and

too low  Our City Friends were thrust below  Whilst as more worthy of our Love  Courtiers were entertain'd above  Tell me who waited then and how  My  Servants  mine  and why not now  In haste then CRAPE to STENTOR go  But send up HART who waits below  With him 'till You return again  Reach me my  Spectacles  and  Cane  I'll make a proof how I advance in  My new accomplishment of  dancing    NOT

 Rebel  SCOT hath often bled  Where Arms are kept so clean so bright  'Twere Sin they should be soil'd in fight  Where Brutes of  foreign  race are shewn  By Brutes much greater of  our own    Fast by the crouded  Thames  is found  An ample square of sacred ground  Where artless  Eloquence  presides  And  Nature  ev'ry sentence guides  HERE  Female Parliaments  debate  About Religion Trade and

Honours of the  Vulgar Tongue    HERE STENTOR always heard with awe  In thund'ring accents deals out Law  Twelve Furlongs off each dreadful word  Was plainly and distinctly heard  And ev'ry neighbour

 Against the Bridge indignant roars  And lashes the resounding shores  Compar'd with  him  at lowest Tide  In softest whispers seem to glide  HITHER directed by the noise  Swell'd with the hope of
