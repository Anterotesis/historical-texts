AND A PORTRAIT OF Mr EDWIN FINELY EXECUTED  The SECOND EDITION with Considerable ADDITIONS  The sportive Muse is my Physician  To cure the Folly and the Madness  Of Pride of Envy and Ambition  Of Spleen and melancholy Sadness  Soon as I touch the jocund Lyre  That Instant driven from their Seat  The Daemons of the Mind retire  And go and persecute the Great  Crazy Tales  LONDON PUBLISHED BY WILLIAM HOLLAND NO OXFORDSTREET NEAR BERNER'SSTREET REMOVED FROM NO DRURYLANE  ACCOUNT of Mrs SIDDONS's first Reception in DUBLIN  When this whimsical Account first appeared in Dublin the Lady's friends were outrageous against the Author The Humourist kept himself snug while a number of Literary Irishmen in London and Dublin were claiming the praise due to him which indeed they have continued to do to this hour though the pleasant fugitive is now well known to be the offspring of the facetious    ON Saturday Mrs Siddons about whom all the World has been talking exposed her beautiful adamantine soft and lovely Person for the first time at the Theatre Royal SmockAlley in the bewitching melting and alltearful Character of Isabella From the repeated panegyrics in the impartial London Newspapers we were taught to expect the sight of an heavenly Angel but how were we supernaturally surprised into the most awful  at beholding a mortal Goddess  The house was crowded with hundreds more than it could hold with thousands of admiring spectators that went away without a sight This extraordinary Phaenomenon of Tragic excellence this Star of Melpomene this Comet of the Stage this Sun of the firmament of the Muses this Moon of blank verse this Queen and Princess of tears this Donnellan of the poisoned bowl this Empress  Rusty Fusty  of the pistol and dagger this Chao of  Shakespeare this World of weeping clouds this Juno of commanding aspect this Terpsichore of the curtain and scenes this Proserpine of fire and earthquake this Katterfelto of wonders exceeded expectation went beyond belief and soared above all the powers of description She was Nature itselfShe was the most exquisite work of art She was the very daisy primrose tuberose sweetbriar surzeblossom gilliflower wallflower cauliflower auricula and rosemary in short she was the Bouquet of Parnassus  Where expectation was raised so high it was thought she would be injured by her appearance but it was the audience who were injured Several fainted even before the curtain drew upbut when she came to the scene of parting with her weddingring ah what a sight was there The very sidiers in the Orchestra albeit unused to melting mood blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread and butter and when the bell rang for music between the acts the tears ran from the bassoon player's eyes in such plentiful showers that they choaked the finger stops and making a spout of the instrument poured in such a torrent on the first fidler's book that not seeing the Overture was in two sharps the leader of the band actually played in one flat  But the sobs and sighs of the groaning audience and the noise of the corks drawn from the smellingbottles prevented the mistake between the flats and the sharps being discovered  One hundred and nine ladies fainted fortysix went into fits and ninetyfive had strong hysterics The world will scarcely credit  when they are told that fourteen children five old women a onehanded sailor and six commoncouncil men  were actually drowned in the inundation of tears that flowed from the galleries lattices and boxes to encrease the briny pond in the pit The water was three feet deep and the people that were obliged to stand upon the benches were in that position up to their ankles in tears  An Act of Parliament against her playing any more will certainly pass for she has infected all the Volunteers and they sit reading the Fatal Marriage crying and roaring the whole morning at the expectation of seeing this Giant's Causeway this Salmon Leap of wonders at night An address has been presented to the good Earl of Charlemont by the principal Volunteers and backed by Doctor Quin and the Faculty of Dublin praying him to stay at home the evening of her appearance else they are convinced she'll tear his infirm frame in pieces with her terrific screams when she's dragged from the corpse of Biron and they'll lose the greatest General that ever headed an army Nature must assuredly in one of her bountiful moments in one of her charitable and humane leisure hours in one of her smiling days in one of her happy weeping months and in one of her allsorrowing gladsome years made this human lump of clayey perfection  Oh happy Hibernia blessed Ierne sanctified land of Saints what a hearse load what a coffin full what a churchyard tree of the brightest excellence of excellencies now stands on the turf of thy fruitful earth  From Cork from Kilarney from Galway from Ballinasloe from Eyrecourt from the East from the West from the North from the South from Island Bridge from Lazor'sHill from the banks of the Canal to the New Road at the back of  Drumcondra shall millions come to SmockAlley to see this astonishing woman  The streets round the Theatre shall be crowded and the very Gabbards that carry coals to Island Bridge shall stop at the BlindQuay and land their unpolished Watermen to spend thirteenpence for a seat in the upper gallery when Isabella is performed  O thou universal Genius what pity it is that thy talents are so confined to Tragedy alone No age nay the Roman Theatre the Stage at ConstantinopleNero himself never performed the scene of madness of grief of joy of woe of distress of sorrow and of pity so well as Mrs Siddons  May the curses of an insulted nation pursue the gentlemen of the College the gentlemen of the Bar and the Peers and Peeresses whose wisdom and discernment have been so highly extolled that hissed her on the second night True it is Mr Garrick never could make any thing of her and pronounced her below mediocritytrue it is the London audience once did not like her but what of that Rise up bright Goddess of the Sock and Buskin and soar to unknown Regions of immortal Praise for  "Envy will merit as its shade pursue"  EDWIN'S PILLS c  SONG  Jemmy Jumps in the  FARMER  LOOK'E dear Ma'am I'm quite the thing  Nattibus hey tippity ho  In my shoe I wear a string  Tied in a black

own  Still with her tongue she chatter'd on  Never could let me alone  Clamper'd scolded and clatter'd on  Blockhead ass cuckold and drone  With these soft words she flatter'd on  Not in my body a bone  But with her knuckles she batter'd on  Kept me quite under her thumb  Tost my hat and wig about  If I said ought but mum  Twirl'd me like a gigg about  Making my body a drum  Trivally beating and jigg about  I was oblig'd to go glum  Like an old grunting pig about  SONG  From the same  LET the Sultan's wanton care  Thousands of the sex prepare  Gentle frisking pretty lasses  Young and handsome as the graces  Let him kiss them one and all  What then what then  This concerns not me at all  For like ev'ry thirsty soul  I prefer the flowing bowl  Let the noble Duke or Peer  Sell his thousand pounds a year  Let him quit his grass and stubble  He'll soon find that life's a bubble  Let him rise or let him fall  What then c  Let the valiant soldier go  Seeking dangers to and fro  Let

United time and pleasure ran  Like Turtles in the grove  In joy and sweet delight  They pass'd each day and night  Chorus  When Nich'las first to court began  And Blanch approv'd his love  Happy and gay  Smiling as May  Jocund they pass'd each day and night  When children bless'd the loving pair  Kind heaven increas'd their store  Their boys were brave their girls were fair  And each a portion bore  Of rural industry  With dance and song and glee  Chorus  When children bless'd c  Tho' age their heads with silver crown'd  Affection did increase  Dissension ne'er their hearts cou'd wound  Nor jealousy their peace  And still remembrance sweet  Their placid minds would greet  Chorus  Tho' age their heads c  SONG  From the same  LORD Lord without victuals and drink  We poets must give up each strain  It helps us poor devils to think  And thrash with more vigour our brain  Without victuals and drink Lord the world were undone  'Tis the soul of the world 'tis the  sine qua non  The soldier 'midst battles alarms  Without it could ill face his foe  So faint would he handle his arms  And draw with such weakness his bow  Without victuals c  What would ladies and gentlemen do  That say such fine things to each other  They would never be able to coo  They would never be father and mother  Without victuals c  Then hey for good victuals and drink  Who's there that would not carouse  Whoever he may be I think  He's not to be found in  this  house  Without victuals c  SONG  From the same  YE topers all drink to the soul  Of this right honest fellow  Who always lov'd a flowing bowl  And would in death be mellow  The lamp of life he kindled up  With spirit stout and glowing  His heart inspired thus with a cup  Ascends where nectar's flowing  SONG  From the same  WHEN we plough the furrow'd land  Two by two the oxen stand  All are coupled two by two  In the meads and verdant groves  See the am'rous turtle doves  How they bill and how they coo  As they couple two by two  With the single lad and lass  How the dismal moments pass  'Till they're coupled two by two  But when each has pledg'd a vow  Lads and lasses speed the plough  When they're coupled two by two  SONG  PEDRILLO

draggletail dreary dun  I saddled his steed so fine and so gay  Galloping dreary dun  I mounted my mule and we rode away  With our haily c  We canter'd along until it grew dark  Galloping dreary dun  The nightingale sung instead of the lark  With her haily c  We met with a Friar and ask'd him our way  Galloping dreary dun  By the Lord says the Friar you're both gone astray  With your haily c  Our journey I fear will do us no good  Galloping dreary dun  We wander alone like the babes in the wood  With our haily c  My master is fighting and I'll take a peep  Galloping dreary dun  But now I think better I'd better go sleep  With my haily  Gaily  Gambo raily  Niggling  Giggling  Galloping Galloway draggletail dreary dun  SONG  From the same  A Soldier I am for a lady  What beau was arm'd

Tho' I die at your feet in the action  Your bobbins may beat up a rowdowdow  Your lapdog may out with his bowwowwow  The challenge in love  I take up the glove  Tho' I die at your feet in the action  SONG  Tom  in Peeping Tom  EGAD we had a glorious feast  So good in kind so nicely drest  Our liquor too was of the best  I'll tell ye  One leg of mutton two fat geese  With beans and bacon ducks and pease  In short we'd ev'ry thing could please  The belly  The clock struck twelve in merry chime  The Priest said grace in Saxon rhyme  Says I to him here is no time  For playing  The room was full when I came in  But soon I napkin'd up my chin  With knife and fork I now begin  To lay in  Our Curate who at such a rate  Of dues and tythepigs us'd to prate  In silence sat behind his plate  A peeping  Most Churchmanlike the Vicar too  A shepherd to his flock below  Like any wolf good mutton now  Was deep in  We nodded health for no one spoke  The cloth roll'd off we crack'd a joke  And

summer day  When breezes cool'd the air  On violet bank Cleora lay  Delighted receiv'd the fair  Young Damon with respectful fear  Had crept behind a woodbine shade  While one arm here and one arm there  Each snowy breast the breeze display'd  Fir'd with the sight young Damon flew  To press the charms he view'd  The youth full well Cleora knew  As in her sight he stood  Resolv'd the youth's delight to share  She kindly seem'd to sink to rest  With one arm here and one arm there  Her bosom heaving to be press'd  Now close beside her Damon lay  His near approach to find  She makes her useless garments play  With motions of the wind  With Damon's joy what can compare  What language paint his fond surprise  When one leg here and one leg there  She threw to shew her glossy thighs  Her coats now Damon gently raised  When love attracts his eye  Cleora scarce than him less pleas'd  Fir'd at the thought of joy  And fill'd with lust that knows no fear  She gently ope'd her glistening eyes  While one leg here and one leg there  Entranc'd between them Damon lies  Then Damon drew th' unerring shaft  That points to beauty true  While new desires fresh breezes wast  He plac'd it in her view  Pleas'd at the sight Cleora fair  Well skill'd its merits sure to scan  With driving here and wriggling there  He bless'd the Maid she bless'd the Man  SONG  LONDON town is just like a barber's

bumper to vanquish the vapours  I scan the fresh quarrels 'twixt new married spouses  To match the debates in both Parliament Houses  Where patriots and placemen keep wrangling for same  The Outs are all faultless the Inns are to blame  Tho' the Outs are the tippee their brains are all addle  Yet when they get in you soon find 'em the twaddle  When Britons base foes dare presume to unite  Old Elliot's the tippee because he dare fight  And to poets who live on the floor next the sky  Roastbeef is a tippee they seldom come nigh  The Lawyer and Doctor both strictly agree  That all is the twaddle except 'tis their fee  And when you from Dover to Calais wou'd straddle  A Balloon is the tippee the Packet's a twaddle  Dick Twisting is now quite the twaddle for tea  Tho' he once was the

Burleigh her mother  And there her daughter a Countess too lie close by one another  These once were bonny dames and though there were no coaches then  Yet cou'd they jog their tails themselves or get

to understand  It is a virtuous Lady fair who died of a prick in her hand  In this fair monument which you see adorned with so many pillars  Doth lie the Countess of Buckingham and her husband Sir

entomb'd with his fair Queen Queen Ann  Edward the Third lies there hard by and he was a gallant man  This is the sword of John of Gaunt a blade both true and trusty  The Frenchmen's blood was ne'er wip'd off which makes it look so rusty  Harry the Fifth lies here entomb'd with his fair Queen Queen Eleanor  To our first Edward she was wife that's more than you knew before  Now down the ladder come we again the man goes first with a staff  Two or three tumble down the stairs and all the people laugh  Sir Robert Vere lies here entomb'd who the Spaniards hide so curried  Four Colonels brave support his tomb and here his body's buried  That statue up against the wall with one eye is Major General Norris  He bang'd the French most cruelly as is affirm'd in stories  Here lies Sir John

Says she he's a very neat barber but pray kick him out of my house  A Doctor I turn'd in our village of many good patients cou'd boast  Their pulses I felt and their noses and cur'd 'em with powder of post  My prentice made up all my bottles but whether to cure or to kill  That business I left to the gravedigger 'twas mine for to bring in my bill  For my country I shoulder my musket my razor and pestle I drop  If an enemy ever invade us I'll bravely go hide in my shop  SONG  From the same  THE Captain see a ranting blade  Expert at grand manoeuvre  My march the pride of our parade  My bow
