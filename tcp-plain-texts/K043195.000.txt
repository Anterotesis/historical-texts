 THE REDCROSS KNIGHTS  A  PLAY  IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL HAYMARKET  FOUNDED ON THE ROBBERS OF SCHILLER  BY J G HOLMAN  LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY  EO CAWTHORN BRITISH LIBRARY NO STRAND BOOKSELLER TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS OF WALES SOLD ALSO BY MESSRS RICHARDSON ROYALEXCHANGE H D SYMONDS J WALLIS AND W WEST PATERNOSTERROW AND J WRIGHT PICCADILLY    ADVERTISEMENT  IN an avowed alteration of THE ROBBERS of SCHILLER it may surprize and disappoint many admirers of that highly celebrated work to find so much of the original displaced for the introduction of new matter I therefore feel it necessary to state my motives for having rather founded a Play on SCHILLER'S than merely adapted THE ROBBERS for representation  Captivated by its beauties I had no other plan when I first undertook to prepare the work for the Stage than to make curtailments and such variations as most Dramas require that are not native productions When completed agreeably to this design its performance was prohibited by the licenser I was unable at the time to account for this interdict having carefully expunged all sentiments that appeared to war against establishments and good order I am aware of an objection which has been made to CHARLES DE MOOR the Hero of THE ROBBERS importing that the grandeur of his character renders him more likely to excite  imitation than abhorrence but this objection I have ever considered as unfounded For surely to exhibit a man whose youthful irregularities are the primary cause of his subsequent misery and who driven by desperation to a life of infamy feels the most pungent anguish for his crimes and expects that eternal torments will be his punishment is so far from violating the purest system of ethics that I am at a loss to conceive how a more forcible lesson of morality can be inculcated  On a more dispassionate investigation of the Play however I found much to justify the licenser's decision Compunction for villainy seems the peculiar feature of CHARLES the rest of the Robbers combine brutal insensibility of their enormities with the most heroic attachment to their leader This junction of sublime virtue with consummate depravity though it may be found in nature should never be dragged into viewthe heroism dazzles the mind and renders it blind to the atrocity  Still unwilling wholly to abandon a favourite object I determined on forming a Play which should retain as much as possible of the original with the omission of  all that could be deemed objectionable This point was only to be accomplished by converting the enterprize of the leading character and his associates from an infamous into an honourable pursuit The history of chivalry naturally suggested itself as abounding with instances of such warlike combinations in the cause of religion and justice Spain presented the most eligible scene of action where those associations were so frequent that many of the most glorious victories over the Moors were effected solely by bands of Knightadventurers and the orders of St Jago Calatrava Alcantara c owe their origin to such laudable confederacies  By this change in the outline I have been enabled to submit a portion of SCHILLER'S ROBBERS to an English audience The labour that has attended this alteration must obviously have been considerable as I was compelled to reconcile contradictions to produce the same effects from totally opposite causes in short in the words of my archetype to make 'Angels of criminals'  Some striking passages of the original which might with consistency have been  preserved in this alteration are omitted because already adopted in recent productions I mention this circumstance solely for my own vindication that I may not be accused of a tasteless rejection of beauties There are situations still retained which may remind the audience of what they have seen before these I conceived to be of too much importance to the piece and too forcible in their nature to incur banishment for no fault but having been deemed worthy of imitation  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY MR TAYLOR  SPOKEN BY MR TRUEMAN  THOUGH fam'd CERVANTES in the happiest vein  Of sportive satire lash'd the gallant train  Who wander'd o'er the world to seek distress  To succour Innocence and Wrongs redress  Yet those Enthusiasts held to ardent youth  The bright career of honour and of truth  Hence with the Sage whom Virtue must deplore  Virtue may grieve that CHIVALRY'S no more  EXALTED SAGE whose glowing pen so well  The fair desert of Chivalry could tell  That prop of rank and sexthat gen'rous pride  Which while it bent obedience dignify'd  That rev'rence of the heart that still we find  Serv'd with the spirit of a freeborn mind  That high disdain of all ignoble strife  A State's  cheap guard  that  'unbought grace of life"  'The nurse of manly sentiment'  the meed  As well as source of each heroic deed  That sensibility with Honour found  Which felt  a stain  as the severest  wound  Which Valour's noble impulse could inspire  Without the fierce extreme of savage ire  'Ennobling all it touch'd'  with wond'rous charm  That void of grossness Vice had less of harm  Such was the wreath departed Genius bore  To deck a bold romantic race of yore  And all who judge them fairly must confess  That e'en their faults were virtues in excess  But 'tis full time to speak about our play  And hence our author bids me freely say  That since the German Stage can so delight  He brings you something from that Stage tonight  A work that foreign wits with zeal admire  For genuine pathos dignity and fire  And should through him its vigour have declin'd  At least its morals will be more refin'd  The Heroes there all legal duties scorn  And deem that man the prey of man was born  But Champions now for VIRTUE'S sacred laws  All perils brave in TRUTH'S eternal cause  Dramatis Personae  Men  COUNT DE LADESMA  Mr Aickin  FERDINAND his

ungrateful  BERTRAN  I have proofs of that Sir  RODERIC  You shall have more anon good Bertran I know your character and respect it You are a man who feel an injury and will resent it You have not forgotten how much the Count Ladesma wronged you Was it not enough to refuse you his ward Eugenia but he must add contempt to his rejectionscoff at your pretensionsas if your small in heritance attached insamy to your name  BERTRAN  May I perish if ever I forget it  RODERIC  But Ferdinand was the cause of this he has Eugenia's heart 'twas for his sake his father rejected you  BERTRAN  Curses on them both I'll be revenged  RODERIC  Right Bertran right Revenge becomes a man Be of good cheer Thou still shalt have Eugenia Come nearer Bertrantake this purse it should be heavier were I the master here Then should you blaze in splendour then should you receive Eugenia from my hand  BERTRAN  Heavens what joy springs from that thought If Ferdinand were deadthen  RODERIC  Ay then we should need no stretch of policy to gain our wishes Ferdinand dead I am the absolute heir of my stepfather Count Ladesma's wealth and power That was determined on my mother's union with him Each by a former marriage having a son the compact was that on the failure of more issue Ferdinand and myself were mutual heirs A contract well stipulated by my prudent mother as my in heritance is not a twentieth part of the rich lordships of Ladesma  BERTRAN  How I long to hail you master of these domains Spain would not then contain a lord more potent than Count Roderic de Froila  RODERIC  You my good Bertran do not only wish me prosperous fortunes but zealously assist me to  obtain them  They plans to which you have so ably ministered have thus far proved successful Our suppression of Ferdinand's letters to his sather and the calumnies we have contrived so artfully to lower him in his regard have answered to my wish This forgery  taking out a letter  will I trust do wonders We have every thing at stake to animate exertion you have your loveI my ambition▪ Retire the Count approaches  Exit  BERTRAN  Enter Count  DE LADESMA  RODERIC  How do you Sir Alas you look paleI fear you are not well  LADESMA  As well as sorrow and old age will let me be  RODERIC  A letter Sir is just arrived from Lerma  LADESMA  From my son Ferdinand  RODERIC  No Sir It appears the hand of your correspondent Don Veremond  LADESMA  Then it relates to my son Read it good Roderic  RODERIC  Consider Sir the intelligence you have of late received has been afflicting very afflicting to a fond father I am therefore alarmed for your health's sakeI beg your pardonbut let me entreat you to hear its contents when you may be better able to bear ill tidings  LADESMA  Oh Ferdinand how you rend your father's heart Alas every fresh account I hear forces me a step nearer to the grave  RODERIC  Then pardon me Sir if I withhold this letter  LADESMA  Rodericfrom you I experience all the tenderness the best of sons could shew mewhile my own offspringAh dear Roderic you have compassion on my grey head you wish to spare me but read the letterlet me know the worst  RODERIC  I shall ever hold it my first duty to obey youin this instance a melancholy dutybut still let us hope that this brings the glad tidings of amendment Let us hope it Sir▪  Reads  "Your son has filled up the measure of his shame His dissolute conduct with the report of which I have hitherto had the melancholy office of wounding your feelings wears the semblance of purity when compared to his last act of infamy His Sovereignso gracious to himwho had loaded him with honours too mighty for his years even had they been merited by his serviceshis Sovereign he deserted and drew his sword on the part of rebellion"  LADESMA  Enough enoughOh oh  RODERIC  "Our monarch is victorious and the unhappy Ferdinand has been brought a prisoner to his injured King who swayed by his attachment  to your noble house has spared his forfeited lifebut the name of Ladesma is stained with treason"  LADESMA  My name my honourable name  RODERIC  Unhappy father  LADESMA  Oh all my prospectsmy golden dreams When he came into life when for the first time I pressed my infant to my bosom did I not call God himself to witness my happiness And nowmisery misery  RODERIC  Oh that I could give you comfort  LADESMA  My comfort lies only in the grave Yet for thy kindness Roderic let me not be ungrateful Heaven that has ordained these tears to flow for the crimes of my son has sent me a son in thee  RODERIC  Oh my father for father you have have ever been to me let me wipe those tears away I would sacrifice my life to prolong thy days  No tie of nature can be more strong more sacred than the bond of duty and affection by which I am devoted to thee  LADESMA  May heaven bless you for your goodness Oh Ferdinand what misery hast thou heaped on thy aged father's head  RODERIC  When I reflect on that Sirwhen I think how he has afflicted you the affection I once bore him is turned to hatred Oh Sir as you value  your peace nay your existence banish him and his vices from your remembrancerenounce for ever this  LADESMA  Renounce my son  RODERIC  Oh that such counsel should ever be forced from my lips But how else can your goaded mind have rest How else can be preserved the life most dear to me  LADESMA  Oh Ferdinand unfeeling childbut still still my child  RODERIC  Think Sirif he be exposed for some time to the pressure of misery is it not probable he will amend Will not affliction prove his best physician to rid him of the vices which indulgence nourished What say you Sir  LADESMA  I will write to him that I abandon him to his fate  RODERIC  You will do wisely  LADESMA  He shall never see my face again  RODERIC  That will be well  LADESMA  With great emotion  Till he become another man  RODERIC  Rightvery rightbutstay Sirone word more I fear your anger may make you express yourself too harshly It would be cruel to drive him at once to despair And on the other  hand would he not interpret a letter written by youas perhaps a sort of pardon Would it not be better Sir if I should write to him  LADESMA  Do so do so Roderic Oh it would break my heart to write to him Write to him that  RODERIC  It is agreed then  LADESMA  Write to him that a thousand tears of blooda thousand sleepless nightsBut don't Roderic don't drive him to despair  RODERIC  Come Sir won't you retire to your chamber This affects you too much  LADESMA  Write to him that his father's heartBut don't don't drive him to despair  Exit  RODERIC  Taking up the letter which he let fall on the ground  This last forgery has proved a masterpiece Ferdinand is banished What followsDesperation That will urge him to acts of danger that may soon make me the rightful heir Or grant he lives he lives an outcast and at Ladesma's death I seize the power which once obtained supports itself Here comes Eugenia From her heart too I must banish Ferdinanday were that heart to break for it  Enter  EUGENIA  RODERIC  Eugenia  EUGENIA  Is it youyou herewhom of all mankind I most desired to see  RODERIC  Me Is it possible me of all mankind  EUGENIA  You Sir even younow then let me enjoy my highest pleasurelet me execrate thee to thy face  RODERIC  Why am I thus treated You wrong me Go to the father who  EUGENIA  The father ah that father who is the wretched dupe of your base artsthat father who has a son the paragon of honour and yet poor weak deluded man him he renounces at the suggestions of a villain  RODERIC  You wrong meyou wrong me vilely  EUGENIA  Wretch I know thee  Ay he deserves to be father of a son like thee  When stretched on the bed of death he shall extend his feeble hands and seek to grasp for the last time his injured noble Ferdinand let him feel thy icy hand thou fiend and shudder at the touch  RODERIC  You rave Eugeniayet spite of your disdain spite of your insults still I love you  EUGENIA  Love from thee I ask thy hateOh I should die with shame while thinking on my Ferdinand could I for a moment believe that thou didst not hate me  RODERIC  Charming enthusiast how that impassioned soul enchants me Ferdinand reigned sole monarch of thy hearttemple sacred to his divinity Creation itself spoke but of Ferdinandof Ferdinand alone to that enraptured soul  EUGENIA  Yes I own ityes spite of your detested slanders to the world I will avow it I love himI adore him  RODERIC  How ungenerous how cruel so basely to requite such fondness nay to forget  EUGENIA  ForgetWhat mean'st thou wretch  RODERIC  He is doubly disloyalto his King and to thee Wore he not once a ring of yoursa ring you put yourself upon his fingera pledge of your fond love Ah those wantons have such fascinating arts  EUGENIA  My ring  RODERIC  Had I had such a jewel and from Eugenia too death itself should not have forced it from this hand  EUGENIA  Detested shameless slanderer Quit my sight  RODERIC  You hate me then  EUGENIA  I scorn thee  RODERIC  Ha Thou shalt repent of this To be sacrificed to an outcasta traitor Vengeance vengeance  Exit  EUGENIA  Go mean and infamous wretch My Ferdinand will triumph over all your baseness He disloyal he a traitor I know his noble nature Treason had never root in such a soil No my Ferdinand thy soul's all truth and honour  Exit  Eugenia  SCENE II  The City of Toledo The Army of  ALPHONSO  King of Castille marching into Toledo after the Victory at Lerma Enter  FERDINAND GARCIAS GUZMAN LANUSA GONSALVO RIPPERDA  c  FERDINAND  Once more welcome to Toledo The rapturous acclamations which hail the return of our Sovereign to his capital must give delight to every honest heart and shew rebellion the weakness of its efforts against a monarch enthroned so firmly in his people's love  GARCIAS  So war's at an end Lie quiet  to his sword  my good old companion you and I must give over our intimacy Well peace may be very desirable to men who have a natural aversion to hard fare and hard blows but to a soldier it is a miserable penance for past sins  What am I to do I can't scribble songs and squall them under a young miss's window by moonlight I must therefore now give place to fellows who brandish goosc▪quills instead of swords and  the blood stained banners of Mars must bow to the silken streamers of Cupid  GUZMAN  Peace curse on the peace that would confine to earth the flight of an eagle▪ 'tis war  r  ates the hero Here then must I bid adieu to all noble enterprize and seek once more my native peaceful fields  FERDINAND  I seek those fields with pleasure To serve my Sovereign and my Country I flew to arms Their wrongs are well revenged the soldier's duty is done Now then in the shade of my paternal woods and in the arms of my dear betrothed Eugenia I court the highest gift of Heavendomestic happiness  GARCIAS  But Ferdinand have you no dread of disappointment Methinks your father's conduct has been strange He has but ill supplied you with the means to keep the state your rank demands and had not your own high merits drawn on you the regard and favours of your Sovereign you could but scantily have borne yourself as the heir of an illustrious house  FERDINAND  That still has filled me with astonishment since my absence from my father he seems not only to have lost his former fondness for me but almost to have forgotten that I am his son Supplies have been assigned me with a niggard hand and the few letters I have received in answer to my warm expressions of respect and love have been filled with sour remonstrances I do not merit▪ and frozen admonitions which I hope I need not  Enter  LERIDA  LERIDA  News news for you my heroes news that will make all your hearts dance  GARCIAS  What's your news Lerida  LERIDA  That peace will not continue long The King has signified his intention of marching against the Moors So you will all get to work again soon  GUZMAN  Not very soon I fear The King aims at their total expulsion from Spain and such an armament as he will▪bear against them now we are exhausted with our late wars will require much time to raise  GARCIAS  So it appears Lerida that your news is like informing a starving man that a twelvemonth hence he is likely to get a dinner  LERIDA  Ferdinand I forgot to tell you that Spinola is in search of you  FERDINAND  What he has letters for me  LERIDA  Yes  FERDINAND  From my father He is here  Enter  SPINOLA  FERDINAND  Running to him  Give me  Takes the letter which he opens and reads  GUZMAN  While he is reading  What now Ferdinand you seem petrified  Ferdinand  lets fall the letter and is going out in distraction  GARCIAS  Where are you going What is the matter Ferdinand  FERDINAND  Pointing to the letter  TherethereOh lost lost for ever  Rushes out  GUZMAN  What can it mean  Takes up the letter and reads  Unfortunate Ferdinand your loyalty has ruined you in your father's regard The emissaries of Don Juan de Lara and Don Emanuel have so completely influenced his feeble mind that he is inflamed against you with the most unnatural resentment for the zeal you have testified in the cause of your Sovereign against those powerful rebels He commands me to tell you that he sends you his malediction and that you have nothing to expect from him but vengeance These are his very words I grieve to add that what you will deem the bitterest revenge is already effected Eugenia your beloved betrothed Eugenia has been forced by him into the arms of one of the rebel adherents and borne away by this husband ravisher I know not whither From my soul I pity you  RODERICK DE FROILA  GARCIAS  No wonder Ferdinand is so afflicted  LERIDA  Why should he be afflicted The whole world is not comprized in his father's castle and forests and of all the losses in life that of a mistress is soonest supplied  GUZMAN  As his friend I lament what causes his misery but were I to consider only his fame I should rejoice at the event which proscribes him from the narrow limits in which his gallant spirit would have been confined and gives him the whole world to range in Oh I could point out to you all the path of glory  GARCIAS  Say on  GUZMAN  Hear me then If there be a drop of true Castilian blood in your veins render yourselves worthy of the rewards of your Sovereign of the affections of your countrymen of the admiration of posterity Let us form into a glorious band to hurl destruction against the foes of our religion and the spoilers of our country  LERIDA  Guzman I honour you  GUZMAN  Reflect the very ground on which we tread was once usurped by Infidels and the proud Crescent waved on the towers of Toledo What drove them from the very heart of Spain to their now narrow confines The lance of glorious chivalry Let them behold in us that Spain has still her champions of the Crossher soldiers of religion and humanity  GARCIAS  Guzman the project is worthy of you With all my soul I am your's  LERIDA  Now why did not this grand idea dawn on my mind 'Tis very strange for I have a brain famous for creating giant enterprizes▪  GARCIAS  Well second the endeavour with your hand and heart and praise the superior genius which got the start of your giant conceptions  LERIDA  Superior genius Ha ha You are given to raillery Garcias No noa lucky hit that is all I allow Superior genius Ha ha  GUZMAN  But my friends one important point remainsa leader for this enterprize  LERIDA  Ay ay there you spoke to the purpose indeed We must have a chiefa man of talents great reacha politic head  standing with his arms across  wise crafty  GUZMAN  If there were any hope that he would consent  LERIDA  Perhaps he may  difficult as it is to guide the ship when buffeted by winds and waves and however cumbrous may be the weight of a diadem  Speak it out boldlyI say perhaps he may be prevailed on  GUZMAN  It will be all children's play if he is not our leader Without Ferdinand we are a body without a head  Lerida  turns away peevishly  Enter  FERDINAND  FERDINAND  Men men False treacherous crocodiles Your eyes are water your hearts are iron Kisses on your lips and poniards in your bosom Whatever malice can invent I have learned to bear I could smile were my enemy to carouse on my heart's blood but when a father's love  becomes a fury's hateOh then must every fibre of the tortured frame be racked to anguish and despair  GUZMAN  Ferdinand hear me  FERDINAND  I loved him with such unbounded affection I would have sacrificed a thousand lives for him and yet without one pang of nature he can consign me to endless misery  GUZMAN  Not so my friend He is the instrument of your glory He snatches you from dishonourable inactivity and impels you to the course of heroism Hear me Ferdinand you are chosen the leader of an enterprize which will immortalize our names Shall our swords which have borne destruction to our country's foes rust in indolence while that country needs their use while Moorish robbers ravage our fertile plains and fellow countrymen and fellow Christians are made the slaves of Infidels  FERDINAND  Guzman I thank thee Yes the wrongs and miseries of Spain shall rouse me from remembrance of my own My poor Eugenia one tear to thy loss and thy distress and now I am all my country's Come fellow warriors hasten to take the sacred vows of chivalry and when its holy badge adorns your bosoms the Infidels shall prove we wear the ensigns of Religion's soldiers not for vain ornament nor empty form but as the zealous active ministers of Heaven Be it our glorious duty to redeem our altars from unbelieving impious violators to release the groaning captive from the gloomy dungeon where he lies body and mind in  shackles forced even to suppress the prayer he would offer to his God and all his torments aggravated by hearing hourly blasphemies against the Being he adores Think what delight will fill your souls to snatch the sufferer from such wretchedness and lead him to Christian temples and his native home  GUZMAN  Ours is indeed a course of glory  FERDINAND  Come then my brethrenChampions of Heaven and of your country Now let the proud oppressor tremble He shall find the prayers of helpless innocence are not put up to Heaven in vain Where'er we meet him he who has wronged the virtuous is our foe and if he dare to mock religion by the name of Christian while his deeds defy its sacred laws he is worse than Infidel That wretch who has the mandate of his God to love his neighbour as himself and yet will injure him what punishment can be for him too mightyyet holdlet us remember an equal mandate of that God is to be merciful  CHORUS  To arms to arms each breast inspiring  Glory leads us to the field  Our country calls our aid requiring  'Gainst Pagan foes the sword to wield  The righteous cause by Heaven is bless'd  Hallow'd the arm that shields th' oppress'd  The Red Cross let our symbol be  And Victory crown our Chivalry  ACT II  SCENE I  The Castle of Ladesma  RODERIC  alone  I HAVE lost all patience An old man's existence is an eternity If one could find a new avenue for death's entrance into the sort of life by wounding the soul to kill the body ha could that be effected But what horrible emotion would have force at once to break the heartstrings Rage No That hungry wolf surfeits himself and regorges his meal Grief That's a worm that lingers in the flesh and mines his way too slowly Fear No Hope blunts his dart and will not let him strike his prey  Musing  I have itTerror is the word Reason religion hope all must retreat before this giant fiendand thenshould he even bear the shock there is more behind Ye blissful years o'erpast display your charms to memory's fond retrospect and poison with your sweets the present hour Ye scenes of future bliss combine to wound shew him the joys of paradise before him and hold the dazzling mirror out to hope but cheat his feeble grasp Thus let me play my battery of death till nature's mound is broken and the whole troop of furies seize the soul and end their work by horror and despair Now then to execute  Enter  BERTRAN  Ha Bertran  BERTRAN  Ever at your service Sir  RODERIC  Bertran we have done much but still have much to accomplish The old man's fondness for his son may yet defeat my purposes and the girl tooEugenia I meanpursues him incessantly with her tears and reproaches He'll soon be sending in quest of him and if he be found good night to both of us Then shall I who would raise you to honour and load you with riches be myself a despised beggar  BERTRAN  No that shall never be  RODERIC  You too my dear Bertran must sink beneath his scourge and all your hopes be blasted by seeing Eugenia in his arms  BERTRAN  Speak What must I do  RODERIC  You find how I enter into your feelings like a true friend Go disguise yourself so as to defy discovery get yourself announced to the old man as one just returned from Arragon report that you there saw Ferdinand breathe his last upon the field I'll give you all the needful documents  BERTRAN  And then it will be "Long live our new master Roderic de Froila"  RODERIC  Even so Look with what certainty and expedition the project works Eugenia's hopes are gone The old man charges himself with the death of his sonhe falls sick A tottering house does not need an earthquake to shake it to the ground He'll never outlive your intelligence Then am I his heir Eugenia has  lost every support and is the plaything of my will You may easily guess what followsYouin short all succeeds to a wishthat is if you shrink not  BERTRAN  Shrink say you No noBertran is firmTrust to himFarewell  Exit  RODERIC  Calling after him  Remember 'tis all for yourself you are working  Looks after him then laughs in derision  How impetuously the blockhead throws off his honesty to snatch at an object that the smallest gleam of common sense must shew him he can never attain This fellow is an arrant knave and yet he confides in a promise It costs him nothing to deceive an honest man and yet when deceived himself he never will forgive it And this is the consistency of the boasted lord of the creation  Exit  SCENE II  Count de Ladesma's Chamber The Count discovered asleep Enter  EUGENIA  EUGENIA  There he sleepsHow good how venerable Angry with thee Oh never never Sweet be thy slumbers as the roses' sweet perfume May the image of Ferdinand visit you in your dreams  Going  LADESMA  In his sleep  Ferdinand Ferdinand Oh my Ferdinand  EUGENIA  Hark his guardian angel has heard my prayer  Coming near him  'Tis sweet to breathe the air in which his name was uttered  LADESMA  Still in his sleep  Are you there Are you there indeed Oh do not look so piteously upon me I am miserable enough already  EUGENIA  Sir Sir  She wakes him  LADESMA  Was he not there Had I not his hand in mine Where am I Are you here Eugenia I was dreaming of my Ferdinand Why did they break my dreams In them my Ferdinand appeared all goodness  EUGENIA  He appeared then as himself He is all goodness  Enter  PERCY  PERCY  My Lord a stranger entreats to see you He says he has tidings for you of importance  LADESMA  To me Eugenia there is but one subject of such tidings you know it Perhaps 'tis some poor creature who comes to me for charityfor reliefhe shall not go hence in sorrow  Exit  Percy  EUGENIA  A beggar and he is received at once  Enter  RODERIC BERTRAN  in disguise and  PERCY  RODERIC  Here is the stranger Sir He says his tidings are of the most distressing nature▪ terrible for  you to hear Can you bear to let him speak them  LADESMA  I know but one thing terrible to hear Speak friend  BERTRAN  You are the father of Ferdinand Ladesma  EUGENIA  Does he live Say where is he where  LADESMA  Speak quickly friend  BERTRAN  After receiving the pardon of his Monarch he did hope forgiveness from his father but when he found you determined to renounce him and that his paternal doors were shut against him deserted abandoned destitute he wandered through Castille begging his wretched sustenance from door to door  LADESMA  Oh do not look at me Eugenia▪  BERTRAN  At length anxious to bear away his poverty and wretchedness from his native country he reached Arragon when the King had just taken arms to quell an insurrection Weary of life and eager to meet a soldier's death he entered the royal army Give me leave said he to the King to die on the bed of heroes I have no longer a father  LADESMA  Oh my Ferdinand  BERTRAN  Your son and I slept in the same tentoften did he speak of his old father of the days of his former happiness and of his blasted hopes till his eyes ran over at the thought  LADESMA  Enoughenoughno more  BERTRAN  A few days after we came to an engagement Your son behaved like a gallant soldier he saw five regiments successively relieved and he kept his ground A shower of arrows was poured in on every quarteryour son kept his grounda spear pierced his right hand he seized the colours with his left and still he kept his ground  EUGENIA  He kept his groundhe kept his ground  BERTRAN  On the evening of the day of battle I found him lying on the field on that same spot weltering in his blood In a faultering voice he cried "dear friend go seek my father tell him his malediction was my doom 'twas that which made me rush on battle and on deathI die in despair" The last word he uttered wasEugenia  EUGENIA  As if waking from a stupor of horror  His last word was Eugenia  LADESMA  'Twas I that caused his death He died by my handhe died in despair  BERTRAN  I cannot bear it this sight of misery unmans me My Lord sarewell  Aside to  Roderic  Have you a heart How could you do this  Exit  EUGENIA  His last sigh breathed Eugenia No thou  art no impostorit is truealas 'tis true He is dead my Ferdinand is dead  Exit  Eugenia  LADESMA  My child my daughter do not abandon me  To  Roderic  Wretch give me back my son  RODERIC  Who gave him his malediction Who was it made him rush on battle and on death Who drove him to despair Oh curse upon his murderers  LADESMA  Accursed be the father who murdered his own son I am that father He loved me even in death To expiate my vengeance▪ he rushed on battle and on death Monster that I am Oh monster  RODERIC  He is dead 'Tis easy to murder but who can restore life  LADESMA  Wretch it was you who forced that malediction from my tongue Oh give me back my son  RODERIC  Rouse not my fury  LADESMA  Inhuman monster give me back my son  Rises furiously  Ten thousand curses on thy head Lightning consume thee  Thou hast robbed me of my only child Hence monster hence'  Exit  Roderic  Oh to despair and not to die They abandon me in death Is my good angel fled Yes every angel must desert the murdererthe hoary murderer Oh oh will none release this spirit No son no  daughter no friend Is there not to be found one kindOh to despair and not to die Ohoh  He faints  Enter  EUGENIA  EUGENIA  Amidst my own affliction still let me think of thine  Going up to him  O Heaven dead dead  Sinks on the ground  SCENE III  The country with a view of a Moorish city Enter  POPOLI  POPOLI  WHAT spiteful fiend an enemy to my happiness could put it into my master Don Ferdinand's head to turn knight errant  I would willingly make that man a present to old Lucifer who first invented the nonsense of Chivalry  Just as if people had not quarrels enough of their own but they must run about thrusting forward their stupid skulls to get the raps that were intended for others For my part I think it quite bad enough to fight when one is forced to it  without running here and there like mad insisting that there shan't be such a thing as a battle on the face of the earth but they must come in for a share of it  We were far enough out of the way of these cursed Moorish fellows if we could but have been contented to sleep in a whole skin but nothing would serve my master and his mad comrades but poking themselves just under their black  noses Oh lord oh lordI can't look at that great huge city stuffed full of Infidels but I tremble all over However the constant fright they keep me in has one good effect it has certainly lowered my appetite and that is very

Ladesma has not learned to  breathe his amorous plaints to the caves and rocks and echoes he speaks and when he is not answered he commands  EUGENIA  Thou command command me And if I laugh to scorn

place above separated from  ROSA  and the other Females  ROSA  OH what a miserable state is mine borne away a captive from my humble happy cottage and threatened with death if I do not comply with the will of the tyrant Governor Ah my dear Antonio I would rather meet a thousand deaths than be false to thee  SONG  Tho' foster'd in the humble cot  My friends of low degree  A higher state I envied not  While blest with liberty  Then sweetly danc'd the hours away  What sorrow could I prove  With all to make the bosom gay  Sweet liberty and love  But now my heart is full of woe  Ah welladay poor me

clashing arms and dying groans▪  While haughty Infidels advance  To meet the Christian warriors' lance  Oh cruel fate  In captive state  Here in servile fetters bound  We can but pour forth useless moans  Louder still is heard the din  The Moorish cry of "Alla" sounds  Now the shouts approach more near  Hark "Alla and our Prophet" hear  This dismal yell  Is our sad knell  They the day will

it glads my soul to see the Christian banners on the Moslem towers  FERDINAND  What splendourwhat lavish waste of riches Here in his gaudy palace and his groves rivalling e'en his Prophet's paradise here the luxurious delegated despot immersed in pleasure and inflamed with pride mistakes the purpose of his exaltation and feels as all were for his use not he for the good of all The cries of wretchedness against oppression disturb the pleasures of the soft voluptuary and are forbid to wound his ears Hence the mighty fearless oppress the weak and he himself placed to be guardian of the poor grasps at their humble pittance to swell his luxury and tho' his province is to check oppression becomes the worst oppressor  GUZMAN  'Twould be justice to vest the injured with the power of their oppressors  FERDINAND  No Guzman Slaves who have burst their bonds and seized on power prove the worst of tyrants And in the preference of  wretchedness he would be wise who rather chose to be enrolled the slave of the most lordly ruler of the East than bear the mockery of a freeman's name where slaves are become rulers No there alone is happinesss where Law is supreme not Will Will

degraded when a woman kneels Chase from your beauteous eyes those tears that speak reproaches which we merit not In us you see the champions of your sex We allow no bonds for lovely woman but the bonds of sweet affection and he who makes his power the agent of his wishes and demands what her repugnant feelings would withhold encloses in a human form a heart that's brutal  POPOLI  Oh what a bevy of beauty and I am told they all belonged to one manwhat a devil of a fellow Well ugly women must have the best chance among the disciples of Mahomet for all the pretty ones are huddled together to fill the Harams of two or three Grandees so that the plain ones who are lest at large must  be able to get a dozen or two husbands apiece Oh what a blessing ugliness must be reckoned here  Enter  LANUSA  with  ANTONIO  and  ROSA  and the rest of the Christian Captives  LANUSA  The Christian Captives  FERDINAND  What happiness is ours to rescue suffering virtue  To the captives  You cannot feel

FERDINAND  Thanks for your courtesy  RODERIC  But say Sir Knight why do we behold you arrayed in Moorish vestments  FERDINAND  'Twas needful policy made me assume this  habit By it I obtained entrance where without such device the gates would have been assailed in vain To combat villainy 'tis sometimes needful that honesty should use the villain's weaponcunning  RODERIC  In war art is meritorious and I rejoice in your success All hearts must rejoice at his triumph who fights the cause of virtue  FERDINAND  Indeed  RODERIC  Surely all hearts of goodness must  FERDINAND  True and even the worst

merrily  The Warder look'd from the tow'r on high  As far as he could see  I see a bold Knight and by his RedCross  He comes from the Moors' country  Then loud the Warder blew his horn  And call'd till he was hoarse  I see a bold Knight and on his shield bright  He beareth a flaming Cross  Oh then the Knight to the Castle came  The lord of it to meet  Who welcome dear to the stranger gave  And lovingly did him greet  Thou'rt welcome here dear RedCross Knight  Dear Knight oh thy news gives joy to me  And the glee shall be sung and the bells shall be rung  And we'll seast right merrily  Oh he

bring  We'll feast us merrily  For all in the Castle shall rejoice  That we've won the victory  And the glee shall be sung  And the bells shall be rung  And the feast ate merrily  The above are the original words in the Glee in the RedCross Knights with such slight alterations as adapted them to the present purpose The Author declined writing new words from the apprehension that no others might so well accord with Mr  Calcot  's exquisite music  SCENE II  A Gallery in the Castle Enter  RODERIC  RODERIC  WHAT can this stranger want This unknown Knight Does he not seem a spy of hell to dog me

hereafter save your breath  RODERIC  With reserve  Hum And what may those words be  BERTRAN  With malignant irony  "Thou still shalt have Eugenia"  RODERIC  Astonished  Bertran  BERTRAN  "Eugenia has lost every support and is the plaything of my will Then you may easily guess what followsin short all succeeds to a wish"  With an indignant sneer and then with haughtiness  Now Count Ladesma what

stab him Ay But if my shadow should discover me while I struck him UghHa Well thought of This very nightin his bed There is a secret passage to his chamber This night then by a single blow I will release myself from every fear  Exit  SCENE III  A Bedchamber in the Castle  FERDINAND  discovered  FERDINAND  'Tis clear I am the victim of infernal treachery Perhaps my father's death too hastened by some vile calumny against the son whom once he doated on Oh why is man created so imperfect that his honesty should be his ruin Why is the guileless heart ever devoid of needful caution to escape the stroke of villainy The brute however harmless by instinct knows his soe yet man the lord of reason clouded by his integrity cannot discern a human monster till he becomes the victim of his sangs

the open air may be needfully cooling and pleasingly refreshing to the hotblooded sparks my master's associates but my constitution is quite of another kind I have a temperate pulse that does not need the fanning of midnight breezes  and as for the grandeur of nature I have a low groveling soul that gives the preference to the humblest works of artfor instance the poorest flock mattress is preferable to me to all the beds of roses and lil  es that ever bloomed in the sweetest of vallies  and I would willingly exchange this fine spangled canopy for the humblest tester in the worst hovel
