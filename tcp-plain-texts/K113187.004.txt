 THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY  SECT XLIV  MORE poetry was written in the single reign of Elizabeth than in the two preceding centuries The same causes among others already enumerated and explained which called forth genius and imagination such as the new sources of fiction opened by a study of the classics a familiarity with the French Italian and Spanish writers the growing elegancies of the English language the diffusion of polished manners the felicities of long peace and public prosperity and a certain freedom and activity of mind which immediately followed the national emancipation from superstition contributed also to produce innumerable compositions in poetry In prosecuting my further examination of the poetical annals of this reign it there  ore becomes necessary to reduce such a latitude of materials to some sort of methodical arrangement On which account I shall class and consider the poets of this reign under the general heads or divisions of SATIRE SONNET PASTORAL and MISCELLANEOUS poetry Spenser will stand alone without a class and without a rival  Satire specifically so called did not commence in England till the latter end of the reign of queen Elizabeth We have seen indeed that eclogues and allegories were made the vehicle of satire and that many poems of a satirical tendency had been published long ago And here the censure was rather confined to the corruptions of the clergy than extended to popular follies and vices But the first professed English satirist to speak technically is bishop Joseph Hall successively bishop of Exeter and Norwich born at Bristowpark within the parish of Ashby de la Zouch in Leicestershire in the year and at the age of fifteen in the year admitted into Emanuelcollege at Cambridge where he remained about eight years He soon became eminent in the theology of those times preached against predestination before prince Henry with unrivalled applause and discussed the doctrines of Arminianism in voluminous dissertations But so variable are our studies and so fickle is opinion that the poet is better known to posterity than the prelate or the polemic His satires have outlived his sermons at court and his laborious confutations of the Brownists One of his later controversial tracts is however remembered on account of the celebrity of its antagonist When Milton descended from his dignity to plead the cause of fanaticism and ideal liberty bishop Hall was the defender of our hierarchical establishment Bayle who knew Hall only as a theologist seems to have written his life merely because he was one of the English divines at the Synod of Dort in From his inflexible and conscientious attachment to the royal and episcopal cause under king Charles the first he suffered in his old age the severities of imprisonment and sequestration and lived to see his cathedral converted into a barrack and his palace into an alehouse His uncommon learning was meliorated with great penetration and knowledge of the world and his mildness of manners and his humility were characteristical He died and was obscurely buried without a memorial on his grave in and in his eighty second  year at Heigham a small village near Norwich where he had sought shelter from the storms of usurpation and the intolerance of presbyterianism  I have had the good fortune to see bishop Hall's funeralsermon preached some days after his interment on the thirtieth day of September at saint Peter's church in Norwich by one John Whitefoote Master of Arts and rector of Heigham The preacher no contemptible orator before he proceeds to draw a parallel between our prelate and the patriarch Israel thus illustrates that part of his character with which we are chiefly concerned and which I am now hastening to consider  "Two yeares together he was chosen rhetorick professor in the universitie of Cambridge and performed the office with extraordinary applause He was noted for a singular wit from his youth a most acute rhetorician and an elegant poet He understood many tongues and in the rhetorick of his own he was second to none that lived in his time  Fol  "  It is much to our present purpose to observe that the style of his prose is strongly tinctured with the manner of Seneca The writer of the satires is perceptible in some of his gravest polemical or scriptural treatises which are perpetually interspersed with excursive illustrations familiar allusions and observations on life Many of them were early translated into French and their character is well drawn by himself in a dedication to James the first who perhaps would have much better relished a more sedate and profound theology  "Seldome any man hath offered to your royall hands a greater bundle of his owne thoughts nor perhaps more varietie of discourse For here shall your maiestie find Moralitie like a good handmaid waiting on Divinitie and Divinitie like some great lady euery day in seuerall dresses Speculation interchanged with

modern edition however a thin duodecimo was printed at Oxford for R Clements under the direction of Mr Thomson late fellow of Queen's college Oxford The editors followed an edition bought from Lord

impression of Hall's Satires and the Norfolk gentleman's manuscript poems annexed a false title appeared in  "VIRGIDEMIARUM Sixe Bookes First three bookes Of toothlesse Satyrs POETICALL ACADEMICALL MORAL London Printed by John Harison for Robert Dexter "  All that follows is exactly what is in the edition of By VIRGIDEMIA an uncouth and uncommon word we are to understand a Gathering or Harvest of rods in reference to the nature of the subject  These satires are marked with a classical precision to which English poetry had yet rarely attained They are replete with animation of style and sentiment The indignation of the satirist is always the result of good sense Nor are the thorns of severe invective unmixed with the flowers of pure poetry The characters are delineated in strong and lively colouring and their discriminations are touched with the masterly traces of genuine humour The versification is equally energetic and elegant and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the modern standard It is no inconsiderable proof of a genius predominating over the general taste of an age when every preacher was a punster to have written verses where laughter was to be raised and the reader to be entertained with sallies of pleasantry without quibbles and conceits His chief fault is obscurity arising from a remote phraseology constrained combinations unfamiliar allusions elleiptical apostrophes and abruptness of expression Perhaps some will think that his manner betrays too much of the laborious exactness and pedantic anxiety of the scholar and the student Ariosto in Italian and Regnier in French were now almost the only modern writers of satire and I believe there had been an English translation of Ariosto's satires But Hall's acknowledged patterns are Juvenal and Persius not without some touches of  the urbanity of Horace His parodies of these poets or rather his adaptations of antient to modern manners a mode of imitation not unhappily practiced by Oldham Rochester and Pope discover great facility and dexterity of invention The moral gravity and the censorial declamation of Juvenal he frequently enlivens with a train of more refined reflection or adorns with a novelty and variety of images  In the opening of his general PROLOGUE he expresses a decent consciousness of the difficulty and danger of his new undertaking The laurel which he sought had been unworn and it was not to be won without hazard  I FIRST ADVENTURE with foolhardy might  To tread the steps of perilous despight  I FIRST ADVENTURE follow me who list  And be the SECOND ENGLISH SATIRIST  His first book containing nine satires is aimed at the numerous impotent yet fashionable scribblers with which his age was infested It must be esteemed a curious and valuable picture drawn from real life of the abuses of poetical composition which then prevailed and which our author has at once exposed with the wit of a spirited satirist and the good taste of a judicious critic Of Spenser who could not have been his cotemporary at Cambridge as some have thought but perhaps was his friend he constantly speaks with respect and applause  I avail myself of a more minute analysis of this Book not only as displaying the critical talents of our satirist but as historical of the poetry of the present period and illustrative of my general subject And if in general I should be thought too copious and prolix in my examination of these satires my apology must be my wish to revive a neglected writer of real genius and my opinion that the first legitimate author in our language of a species of poetry of the most important and  popular utility which our countrymen have so successfully cultivated and from which Pope derives his chief celebrity deserved to be distinguished with a particular degree of attention  From the first satire which I shall exhibit at length we learn what kinds of pieces were then most in fashion and in what manner they were written They seem to have been tales of love and chivalry amatorial sonnets tragedies comedies and pastorals  Nor ladie's wanton loue nor wandering knight  Legend I out in rimes all richly dight  Nor fright the reader with the pagan vaunt  Of mightie Mahound and great Termagaunt  Saracen divinities    Nor list I sonnet of my mistress' face  To paint some Blowesse  In modern ballads Blousilinda or Blousibella Doctor Johnson interprets BLOWZE a ruddy fatfaced wench DICT in V  with a borrow'd grace  Nor can I bide  Abide bear endure  to pen some hungrie  Perhaps the true reading is  angrie  that is impassioned These satires have been most carelessly printed  scene  For thickskin ears and undiscerning eene  Nor euer could my scornfull Muse abide  With tragicke shoes  Buskins  her anckles for to hide  Nor can I crouch and withe my fawning tayle  To some great patron for my best auayle  Such hungerstarven trencher poetrie  Poetry written by hirelings for bread    Or let it neuer liue or timely die  Nor vnder euerie bank and euerie tree  Speake rimes vnto mine oaten minstrelsie  Nor carol our so pleasing liuely laies  As might the Graces moue my mirth to praise  Perhaps this couplet means Comedy    Trumpet and reeds and socks and buskins fine  I them bequeathe  Heroic poetry pastorals comedy and tragedy I leave to the celebrated established masters in those different kinds of composition such as Spensor and Shakespeare Unless the classic poets are intended The imitation from Persius's PROLOGUE is obvious  whose statues th' wandring twine  Of iuie mix'd with bayes circles around  Their liuing temples likewise lawrelbound  Rather had I albe in careless rimes  Check the misorder'd world and lawless times  Nor need I craue the Muse's midwifry  To bring to birth so worthless poetry  Or if we list  Or even if I was willing to invoke a muse c  what baser Muse can bide  To sit and sing by Granta's naked side  They haunt the tided Thames and salt Medway  Eer since the fame of their late bridal day  Nought have we here but willowshaded shore  To tell our Grant his bankes are left forlore  B i f edit    The compliment in the close to Spenser is introduced and turned with singular address and elegance The allusion is to Spenser's beautiful episode of the marriage of Thames and Medway recently published in in the fourth book of the second part of the FAIRY QUEEN  B iv C xi  But had I says the poet been inclined to invoke the assistance of a Muse what Muse even of a lower order is there now to be found who would condescend to sit and sing on the desolated margin of the Cam The Muses frequent other rivers ever since Spenser celebrated the nuptials of Thames and Medway Cam has now nothing on his banks but willows the types of desertion  I observe here in general that Thomas Hudson and Henry Lock were the Bavius and Mevius of this age In the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS they are thus consigned to oblivion by Judicio  "Locke and Hudson sleep you quiet  shavers among the shavings of the press and let your books lie in some old nook amongst old boots and shoes so you may avoid my censure  A i S ii  "  Hudson translated into English Du Bartas's poem of JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES in which is this couplet  And at her eare a pearle of greater valew  There hung than that th' Egyptian queene did swallow  Yet he is commended by Harrington for making this translation in a  "verie good and sweet English verse  Transl ORL FUR Notes B xxxv p Hence or from an old Play the name HOLOFERNES got into Shakespeare  "  and is largely cited in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS Lock applied the Sonnet to a spiritual purpose and substituting christian love in the place of amorous passion made it the vehicle of humiliation holy comfort and thanksgiving This book he dedicated under the title of the PASSIONATE PRESENT to queen Elizabeth who perhaps from the title expected to be entertained with a subject of very different nature  I have before cited this Collection which appeared in vol iii That was a second edition To his ECCLESIASTES there is a recommendatory poem by Lilly Some of David's Psalms in verse appear with his name the same year    In the second satire our author poetically laments that the nine Muses are no longer vestal virgins  Whilom the Muses nine were vestal maides  And held their temple in the secret shades  Of faire Parnassvs that twoheaded hill  Whose avncient fame the southern world did fill  And in the stead of their eternal fame  Was the cool stream that took his endless name  From out the fertile hoof of winged steed  There did they sit and do their holy deed  That pleas'd both heaven and earth  He complains that the  rabble of rymesters new  have engrafted the myrtle on the bay and that poetry departing from its antient moral tendency has been unnaturally perverted to the  purposes of corruption and impurity The Muses have changed in defiance of chastity  Their modest stole to garish looser weed  Deckt with louefauours their late whoredom's meed  While the pellucid spring of Pyrene is converted into a poisonous and muddy puddle  Whose infectious staine  Corrupteth all the lowly fruitfull plaine  B i f    Marlow's OVID'S ELEGIES and some of the dissolute sallies of Green and Nash seem to be here pointed out I know not of any edition of Marston's PYGMALION'S IMAGE before the year and the CALTHA POETARUM or BUMBLEBEE one of the most exceptionable books of this kind written by T Cutwode appeared in  To R Olave April REGISTR STATION C f b  Shakespeare's VENUS AND ADONIS published in had given great offence to the graver readers of

eternall lines  To tye Adonis to her loues designes  Fine wit is shewn therein but finer 'twere  If not attired in such bawdy geere  But be it as it will the coyest dames  In priuate reade it for

list reade lust there's VENUS AND ADONIS  True model of a most lasciuious letcher    In the subsequent satire our author more particularly censures the intemperance of his brethren and illustrates their absolute inability to write till their imaginations were animated by wine in the following apt and witty comparison which is worthy of Young  As frozen dunghills in a winter's morn  That void of vapours seemed all beforn  Soon as the sun sends out his piercing beams  Exhale forth filthy smoak and stinking steams  So doth the base and the forebarren brain  Soon as the raging wine begins to raign  In the succeeding lines he confines his attack to Marlow eminent for his drunken frolicks who was both a player and a poet and whose tragedy of TAMERLANE THE GREAT represented before the year published in and confessedly one of the worst of his plays abounds in bombast Its false splendour was also burlesqued by Beaumont and Fletcher in the COXCOMB and it has these two lines which are ridiculed by Pistol in Shakespeare's KING HENRY THE FOURTH  A ii S iv  addressed to the captive princes who drew Tamerlane's chariot  Holla you pamper'd jades of Asia  What can ye draw but twenty miles a day  We should in the mean time remember that by many of the most skilful of our dramatic writers tragedy was now thought almost essentially and solely to consist in the pomp of declamation in sounding expressions and unnatural amplifications of style But to proceed  One higher pitch'd doth set his soaring thought  On crowned kings that fortune low hath brought  Or some vpreared highaspiring swaine  As it might be the Turkish Tamberlaine  There is a piece entered to R Jones Aug entitled  "Comicall discourses of Tamberlain the Cithian Scythian shepherd"  REGISTR STATION B f b Probably the story of Tamerlane was introduced into our early drama from the following publication  "The historie of the great emperour Tamerlane drawn from the antient monuments of the Arabians By messire Jean du Bec abbot of Mortimer Translated into English by H M London for W Ponsonbie "  to I cite from a second edition    Then weeneth he his base drinkdrowned spright  Rapt to the threefold loft of heauen's hight  When he conceiues upon his faigned stage  The stalking steps of his great personage  Graced with huff cap termes and thundering threats  That his poor hearers hair qvite vpright sets  So soon as some braue minded hungrie youth  Sees fitly frame to his widestrained mouth  He vaunts his voice vpon a hired stage  With highset steps and princelie carriage  There if he can

in the SUPPLEMENT TO SHAKESPEARE i seq See supr vol iii    But adds the critical satirist that the minds of the astonished audience may not be too powerfully impressed with the terrours of tragic solemnity a VICE or buffoon is suddenly and most seasonably introduced  Now lest such frightful shews of fortvne's fall  And bloody tyrant's rage should chance appall  The deadstruck audience mid the silent rout  Comes leaping in a selfmisformed lout  And laughs and grins and frames his mimic face  And jostles straight into the prince's place  A goodlie hotchpotch when vile russetings  Are match'd with monarchs and with mighty kings  A goodly grace to sober tragick muse  When each base clowne his clumsy fist doth bruise  In striking the benches to express applause    To complete these genuine and humorous anecdotes of the state of our stage in the reign of Elizabeth I make no apology for adding the paragraph immediately following which records the infancy of theatric criticism  Meanwhile our poets in high parliament  Sit watching euerie word and gesturement  Like curious censors of some doutie gear  Whispering their verdict in their fellows ear  Woe to the word whose margin in their scrole  Copy  Is noted with a black condemning coal  But if each period might the synod please  Ho bring the ivie boughs and bands of bayes  B i f    In the beginning of the next satire he resumes this topic He seems to have conceived a contempt for blank verse observing that the English iambic is written with little trouble and seems rather a spontaneous effusion than an artificial construction  Too popular is tragick poesie  Straining his tiptoes for a farthing fee  And doth beside on rimeless numbers tread  Unbid iambicks flow from careless head  He next inveighs against the poet who  in high heroic rimes  Compileth wormeat stories of old times  To these antique tales he condemns the application of the extravagant enchantments of Ariosto's ORLANDO FURIOSO particularly of such licentious fictions as the removal of Merlin's tomb from Wales into France or Tuscany by the magic operations of the sorceress Melissa  See ORL FUR iii xxvi  The ORLANDO had been just now translated by Harrington  And maketh up his hardbetaken tale  With strange inchantments fetch'd from darksom vale  Of some Melissa who by magick doom  To Tuscans soile transporteth Merlin's tomb  But he suddenly checks his career and retracts his thoughtless temerity in presuming to blame such themes as had been immortalised by the fairy muse of Spenser  But let no rebel satyr dare traduce  Th' eternal legends of thy faerie muse  Renowned Spenser Whom no earthly wight  Dares once to emulate much less dares despight  Salust  Du Bartas  of France and Tuscan Ariost  Yield vp the lawrell garland ye haue lost  B i f In the Stanzas called a DEFIANCE to ENVY prefixed to the Satires he declares his reluctance and inability to write pastorals after Spenser  At Colin's feet I throw my yielding reede  But in some of those stanzas in which he means to ridicule the pastoral he proves himself admirably qualified for this species of poetry    In the fifth he ridicules the whining ghosts of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES which the ungenerous and unpitying poet sends back to hell without a penny to pay Charon for their return over the river Styx  B i f    In the sixth he laughs at the hexametrical versification of the Roman prosody so contrary to the genius of our language lately introduced into English poetry by Stanihurst the translator of Virgil and patronised by Gabriel Harvey and sir Philip Sidney  Another scorns the homespun thread of rimes  Match'd with the lofty feet of elder times  Giue me the numbred verse that Virgil sung  And Virgil's selfe shall speake the English tounge  The nimble dactyl striving to outgo  The drawling spondees pacing it below  The lingering spondees labouring to delay  The breathless dactyls with a sudden stay  B i f    His own lines on the subject are a proof that English verse wanted to borrow no graces from the Roman  The false and foolish compliments of the sonnetwriter are the object of the seventh satire  Be she all sooty black or berry brown  She's white as morrow's milk or flakes newblown  He judges it absurd that the world should be troubled with the history of the smiles or frowns of a lady as if all mankind were deeply interested in the privacies of a lover's heart and the momentary revolutions of his hope and despair  B i f    In the eighth our author insinuates his disapprobation of sacred poetry and the metrical versions of scripture which were encouraged and circulated by the puritans He glances at Robert Southwell's SAINT PETER'S COMPLAINT  Wood says that this poem was written by Davies of Hereford ATH OXON i But he had given it to Southwell p  in which the saint  weeps pure Helicon  published this year and the same writer's FUNERALL TEARES of the two Maries He then but without mentioning his name ridicules Markham's SION'S MUSE a translation of Solomon's Song  See supr vol iii p  Here says our satirical critic Solomon assumes the character of a modern sonnetteer and celebrates the sacred spouse of Christ with the levities and in the language of a lover singing the praises of his mistress  B i f    The hero of the next satire I suspect to be Robert Greene who practiced the vices which he so freely displayed in his poems Greene however died three or four years before the publication of these satires  In Feb a piece is entered to Danter called Greene's Funerall REGISTR STATION B f b  Nor is it very likely that he  should have been as Oldys has suggested in some manuscript papers Hall's cotemporary at Cambridge for he was incorporated into the University of Oxford as a Master of Arts from Cambridge in July under the year  Registr Univ Oxon sub ann  But why should we be sollicitous to recover a name which indecency most probably joined with dulness has long ago deservedly delivered to oblivion Whoever he was he is surely unworthy of these elegant lines  Envy ye Muses at your thriving mate  Cupid hath crowned a new laureate  I sawe his statue gayly tir'd in green  As if he had some second Phebus been  His statue trimm'd with the Venerean tree  And shrined fair within your sanctuary  What he that erst to gain the rhyming goal c  He then proceeds with a liberal disdain and with an eye on the stately buildings of his university to reprobate the Muses for this unworthy profanation of their dignity  Take this ye Muses this so high despight  And let all hatefull luckless birds of night  Let screeching owles nest in your razed roofs  And let your floor with horned satyr's hoofs  Be dinted and defiled euerie morn  And let your walls be an eternal scorn  His

exhilarated the circles of the polite and the profligate Their way of life gave the colour to their writings and what had been the favourite topic of conversation was sure to please when recommended by the graces of poetry Add to this that poets now began to write for hire and a rapid sale was to be obtained at the expence of the purity of the reader's mind  Harrington has an Epigram on this subject EPIGR B i  Poets hereaft for pensions need not care  Who call you beggars you may call them lyars  Verses are grown svch merchantable ware  That now for Sonnets sellers are and buyers  And

and that is this he cannot swagger it well in a tavern  A i S ii  "  The first satire of the second Book properly belongs to the last In it our author continues his just and pointed animadversions on immodest poetry and hints at some pernicious versions from the FACETIAE of Poggius Florentinus and from Rabelais The last couplet of the passage I am going to transcribe is most elegantly expressive  But who conjur'd this bawdie Poggie's ghost  From out the stewes of his lewde homebred coast  Or wicked Rablais' drunken reuellings  Harvey in his Foure Letters mentions  "the fantasticall mould of Aretine or Rabelays"  p Aretine is mentioned in the last satire    To grace the misrule of our tauernings  Or who put bayes into blind Cupid's fist  That he should crowne what laureates him list  B ii f    By  tauernings  he means the encreasing fashion of frequenting taverns which seems to have multiplied with the playhou  es As new modes of entertainment sprung up and new places of public resort became common the people were more often called together and the scale of convivial life in London was enlarged From the playhouse they went to the tavern In one of Decker's pamphlets printed in there is a curious chapter  "How a yong Gallant should behave himself in an Ordinarie  Decker's GULS HORNE BOOK p There is an old quarto  "The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinarie or the Walkes of Powles"

called by a cotemporary writer the most witty elegant and eloquent display of the vices of London then extant W Fennnor's COMPTOR'S COMMONWEALTH to p  "  In the second satire he celebrates the wisdom and liberality of our ancestors in erecting magnificent mansions for the accommodation of scholars which yet at present have little more use than that of reproaching the rich with their comparative neglect of learning The verses have much dignity and are equal to the subject  To what end did our lavish auncestours  Erect of old those statelie piles of ours  For thread bareclerks and for the ragged muse  Whom better fit some cotes of sad secluse  Blush niggard Ago be asham'd to see  Those monuments of wiser auncestrie  And ye faire heapes the Muses sacred shrines  In spight of time and

restlesse quill  To pore on painted leaues or beate my braine  With farfetch'd thought or to consvme in uaine  In latter euen or midst of winter nights  Illsmelling oyles or some stillwatching lights c  He concludes his complaint of the general disregard of the literary profession with a spirited paraphrase of that passage of Persius in which the philosophy of the profound Arcesilaus and of the  aerumnosi Solones  is proved to be of so little use and estimation  B ii f In the last line of this satire he says  Let swinish Grill delight in dunghill clay  Gryllus is one of Ulysses's companions transformed into a hog by Circe who refuses to be restored to his human shape But perhaps the allusion is immediately to Spenser FAIR QU ii    In the third he laments the lucrative injustice of the law while ingenuous science is without emolument or reward The exordium is a fine improvement of his original  Who doubts the Laws fell downe from heauen's hight  Like to some gliding starre in winters night  Themis the scribe of god did long agone  Engrave them deepe in during marble stone  And cast them downe on this unruly clay  That men might know to rule and to obey  The interview between the anxious client and the rapacious lawyer is drawn with much humour and shews the authoritative superiority and the mean subordination subsisting between the two characters at that time  The crowching client with lowbended knee  And manie worships and faire flatterie  Tells on his tale as smoothly as him list  But still the lawyer's eye squints on his fist  If that seem lined with a larger fee  "Doubt not the suite the law is plaine for thee"  Tho  Yet even  must he buy his vainer hope with price  Disclout his crownes  Pull them out of his purse  and thanke him for advice  B ii f  I cite a couplet from this satire to explain it  Genus and Species long since barfoote went  Upon their tentoes in wilde wonderment c  This is an allusion to an old distich made and often quoted in the age of scholastic science  Dat Galenus opes dat Justinianus honores  Sed Genus et Species cogitur ire pedes  That is the study of medicine produces riches and jurisprudence leads to stations and offices of honour while the professor of logic is poor and obliged to walk on foot    The fourth displays the difficulties and discouragements of the physician Here we learn that the  sick lady  and the  gouty peer  were then topics of the ridicule of the satirist  The sickly ladie and the gowtie peere  Still would I haunt that loue their life so deere  Where life is deere who cares for coyned drosse  That spent is counted gaine and spared losse  He thus laughs at the quintessence of a sublimated mineral elixir  Each powdred graine ransometh captive kings  Purchaseth realmes and life prolonged brings  B ii f    Imperial oils golden cordials and universal panaceas are of high antiquity and perhaps the puffs of quackery were formerly more ostentatious than even at present before the profession of medicine was freed from the operations of a spurious and superstitious alchemy and when there were mystics in philosophy as well in religion Paracelsus was the father of empericism  From

humorous in the whole collection and which I shall therefore give at length exhibits the servile condition of a domestic preceptor in the family of an esquire Several of the  satires of this second BOOK are intended to shew the depressed state of modest and true genius and the inattention of men of fortune to literary merit  A gentle squire would gladly entertaine  Into his house some trencherchapelaine  Or a tablechaplain In the same sense me have  trencherknight  in LOVES LABOUR LOST    Some willing man that might instruct his sons  And that would stand to good conditions  First that he lie vpon the trucklebed  While his young maister lieth oer his head  This indulgence allowed to the pupil is the reverse of a rule antiently practiced in our universities In the Statutes of Corpus Christi college at Oxford given in the Scholars are ordered to sleep respectively under the beds of the Fellows in a trucklebed or small bed shifted about upon wheels  "Sit unum cubile altius et aliud humile et rotale et in altiori cubet Socius in altero semper Discipulus"  Cap xxxvii Much the same injunction is ordered in the statutes of Magdalen college Oxford given  "Sint duo lecti principales et duo lecti rotales  Trookyll beddys  vulgariter nuncupati c"  Cap xlv And in those of Trinity college Oxford given where  troccle bed  the old spelling of the word  truckle bed

meanly decked B vi i f  Now shalt thou never see the Salt beset  With a bidbellied gallon flagonet  In Jonson's CYNTHIA'S REVELLS acted in it is said of an affected coxcomb  "His fashion is not to

line  All these observ'd he could contented be  To give five markes and winter liverie  B ii f    From those who despised learning he makes a transition to those who abused or degraded it by false pretences Judicial astrology is the subject of the seventh satire He supposes that astrology was the daughter of one of the Egyptian midwives and that having been nursed by Superstition she assumed the garb of Science  That now who pares his nailes or libs his swine  But he must first take covnsel of the signe  Again of the believer in the stars he says  His feare or hope for plentie or for lack  Hangs all vpon his newyear's  Almanack  If chance once in the spring his head should ake  It was fortold "thus says mine  Almanack"  The numerous astrological tracts particularly pieces called PROGNOSTICATIONS published in the reign of queen Elizabeth are a proof how strongly the people were infatuated with this sort of divination One of the most remarkable was a treatise written in the year by Richard Harvey brother to Gabriel Harvey a learned astrologer of Cambridge predicting the portentous conjunction of the primary planets Saturn and Jupiter which was to happen the next year It had the immediate effect of throwing the whole kingdom into the most violent consternation When the fears of the people were  over Nash published a droll account of their opinions and apprehensions while this formidable phenomenon was impending and Elderton a balladmaker and Tarleton the comedian joined in the laugh This was the best way of confuting the impertinencies of the science of the stars True knowledge must have been beginning to dawn when these profound fooleries became the objects of wit and ridicule  See Nash's APOLOGY OF PEERS PENNILESS c Lond to f    SECT XLV  THE opening of the first satire of the third Book which is a contrast of antient parsimony with modern luxury is so witty so elegant and so poetical an enlargement of a shining passage in Juvenal that the reader will pardon another long quotation  Time was and that was term'd the time of gold  When world and time were young that now are old  When quiet Saturne sway'd the mace of lead  And pride was yet unborne and yet unbred  Time was that whiles the autumnefall did last  Our hungrie sires gap'd for the falling mast  Could no unhusked akorne leaue the tree  But there was challenge made whose it might be  And if some nice and liquorous appetite  Desir'd more daintie dish of rare delite  They scal'd the stored crab with clasped knee  Till they had sated their delicious ee  Or search'd the hopefull thicks of hedgyrows  For brierie berries hawes or sowrer sloes  Or when they meant to fare the fin'st of all  They lick'd oakeleaues besprint with honyfall  As for the thrise threeangled beechnut shell  Or chesnut's armed huske and hid kernell  Nor squire durst touch the lawe would not afford  Kept for the court and for the king's owne board  Their royall plate was clay or wood or stone  The vulgar saue his hand else he had none  Their onlie cellar was the neighbour brooke  None did for better care for better looke  Was then no 'plaining of the brewer's scape  Cheats    Nor greedie vintner mix'd the strained grape  The king's pavilion was the grassie green  Vnder safe shelter of the shadie treen  But when by Ceres' huswifrie and paine  Men learn'd to burie the reuiuing graine  And father Janus taught the newfound vine  Rise on the elme with manie a friendly twine  And base desire bade men to deluen lowe  For needlesse metalls then gan mischief growe  Then farewell fayrest age c  He then in the prosecution of a sort of poetical philosophy which prefers civilized to savage life wishes for the nakedness or the furs of our simple ancestors in comparison of the fantastic fopperies of the exotic apparel of his own age  They naked went or clad in ruder hide  Or homespun russet void of foraine pride  But thou canst maske in garish gawderie  To suite a Fool's farfetched liuerie  A Frenche head joyn'd to necke Italian  Thy thighs from Germanie and breast from Spain  An Englishman in none a foole in all  Many in one and one in seuerall  B iii f    One of the vanities of the age of Elizabeth was the erection of monuments equally costly and cumbersome charged with a waste of capricious decorations and loaded with superfluous and disproportionate sculpture They succeeded to the rich solemnity of the gothic shrine which yet amid a profusion of embellishments preserved uniform principles of architecture  In the second satire our author moralises on these empty memorials which were alike allotted to illustrious or infamous characters  Some stately tombe he builds Egyptianwise  REX REGUM written on the pyramis  Whereas great Arthur lies in ruder oke  That neuer felt aught but the feller's stroke  He alludes to the discovery of king Arthur's body in Glastonbury abbey Lately in digging up a barrow or tumulus on the downs near Dorchester the body of a Danish chief as it seemed was found in the hollow trunk of a huge oak for a coffin    Small honour can be got with gaudie graue  A rotten name from death it cannot saue  The fairer tombe the fowler is thy name  The greater pompe procvring greater shame  Thy monument make thou thy living deeds  No other tomb than that true virtue needs  What had he nought whereby he might be knowne  But costly pilements of some curious stone  The matter nature's and the workman's frame  His purse's costwhere then is Osmond's name  Deservedst thou ill Well were thy name and thee  Wert thou inditched in great secrecie  Whereas no passengers might curse thy dust c  B iii f    The third is the description of a citizen's feast to which he was invited  With hollow words and ouerly  Slight Shallow  request  But the great profusion of the entertainment was not the effect of liberality but a hint that no second invitation must be expected The effort was too great to be repeated The guest who dined at this table often had only a single dish  B iii f    The fourth is an arraignment of ostentatious piety and of those who strove to push themselves into notice and esteem by petty pretensions The illustrations are highly humorous  Who euer giues a paire of velvet shoes  To th' holy rood  In a gallery over the screen at entering the choir was a large crucifix or rood with the images of the holy Virgin and saint John The velvet shoes were for the feet of Christ on the cross or of one of the attendant figures A rich lady sometimes bequeathed her weddinggown with necklace and earrings to dress up the Virgin Mary This place was called the Roodloft  or liberally allowes  But a new rope to ring the curfew bell  But he desires that his great deed may dwell  Or grauen in the chancellwindow glasse  Or in the lasting tombe of plated brasse  The same affectation appeared in dress  Nor can good Myron weare on his left hond  A signet ring of Bristoldiamond  But he must cut his gloue to shew his pride  That his trim jewel might be better spied  And that men might some burgesse  Some rich citizen  him repute  With sattin sleeves hath  That is  he  hath c  grac'd his sackecloth suit  B iii f    The fifth is a droll portrait of the distress of a  lustie courtier  or fine gentleman whose periwinkle or peruke was suddenly blown off by a boisterous puff of wind while he was making his bows  In a set of articles of enquiry sent to a college in Oxford about the year by the visitor bishop Morley the commissary is ordered diligently to remark and report whether any of the senior fellows wore  periwigs  I will not suppose that bobwigs are here intended But after such a proscription who could imagine that the bushy grizzlewig should ever have been adopted as a badge of gravity So arbitrary are ideas of dignity or levity in dress There is an Epigram in Harrington written perhaps about  "Of Galla's goodly periwigge"  B i This was undoubtedly false hair In Hayman's QUODLIBETS or Epigrams printed there  is one  "to a Periwiggian"  B i p Again  "to a certaine Periwiggian"  B ii p Our author mentions a periwigg again B v f  A golden periwigg on a blackmoor's brow    He lights and runs and quicklie hath him sped  To ouertake his ouerrunning head c  These are our satirist's reflections on this disgraceful accident  Fie on all courtesie and unruly windes  Two only foes that faire disguisement findes  Strange curse but fit for such a fickle age  When scalpes are subject to such vassalage  Is't not sweet pride when men their crownes must shade  With that which jerkes the hams of everie jade  B iii f    In the next is the figure of a famished Gallant or beau which is much better drawn than in any of the comedies of those times His hand is perpetually on the hilt of his rapier He picks his teeth but has dined with duke Humphry  That is he has walked all day in saint Paul's church without a dinner In the body of old saint Paul's was a huge and conspicuous monument of sir John Beauchamp buried in son of Guy and brother of Thomas earls of Warwick This by a vulgar mistake was at length called the tomb of Humphry duke of Gloucester who was really buried at Saint Alban's where his magnificent shrine now remains The middle ile of Saint Paul's is called the  Dukes gallery  in a chapter of the GULS HORNE BOOKE  "How a gallant should behaue himself in Powles Walkes"  CH iiii p Of the humours of this famous ambulatory the general rendezvous of lawyers and their clients pickpookets cheats bu  ks pimps whores poets players and many others who either for idleness or business found it convenient to frequent the most fashionable crowd in London a more particular description may be seen in Dekker's  "DEAD TERME or Westminsters Complaint for long Vacations and short Termes under the chapter  Pawles Steeples complaint  "  SIGNAT D Lond for John Hodgetts to Bl Lett  He professes to keep a plentiful and open house for every  straggling cavaliere  where the dinners are long and enlivened with music and where many a gay youth with a highplumed hat chuses to dine much rather than to pay his shilling He is so emaciated for want of eating that his swordbelt hangs loose over his hip the effect of  hunger and heavy iron  Yet he is dressed in the height of the fashion  All trapped in the newfound brauerie  He pretends to have been at the conquest of Cales where the nuns worked his bonnet His hair stands upright in the  French style with one long lock hanging low on his shoulders which the satirist adds puts us in mind of a  native cord  the truely English rope which he probably will one day wear  His linen collar labyrinthian set  Whose thovsand double turnings neuer met  His sleeves halfhid with elbowpinionings  As if he meant to fly with linen wings  Barnaby Rich in his IRISH HUBBUB printed thus describes four GALLANTS coming from an Ordinary  "The third was in a yellowstarched band that made him looke as if he had been troubled with the yellow iaundisThey were all four in white bootes and gylt spurres c"  Lond to p    But when I looke and cast mine eyes below  What monster meets mine eyes in human show  So slender waist with such an abbot's loyne  Did neuer sober nature sure conjoyne  Lik'st a strawe scarecrow in the newsowne field  Rear'd on some sticke the tender corne to shield  B iii f    In the Prologue to this book our author strives to obviate the objections of certain critics who falsely and foolishly thought his satires too perspicuous Nothing could be more absurd than the notion that because Persius is obscure therefore obscurity must be necessarily one of the qualities of satire If Persius under the severities of a proscriptive and sanguinary government was often obliged to conceal his meaning this was not the case of Hall But the darkness and difficulties of Persius arise in great measure from his own affectation and false taste He would have been enigmatical under the mildest government To be unintelligible can never naturally or properly belong to any species of writing Hall of himself is certainly obscure yet he owes some of his obscurity to an imitation of this ideal excellence of the Roman satirists  The fourth Book breathes a stronger spirit of indignation  and abounds with applications of Juvenal to modern manners yet with the appearance of original and unborrowed satire  The first is miscellaneous and excursive but the subjects often lead to an unbecoming licentiousness of language and images In the following nervous lines he has caught and finely heightened the force and manner of his master  Who list excuse when chaster dames can hire  Some snoutfair stripling to their apple squire  Some fairfaced stripling to be their page Marston has this epithet Sc VILLAN B i  Had I some snoutfaire brats they should indure  The newlyfound Castilion calenture  Before some pedant c  In Satires and Epigrams called THE LETTING OF HUMORS BLOOD IN THE HEADVAYNE we have  "Some

the bribed midwife sweares apace  The bastard babe doth beare his father's face  He thus enhances the value of certain novelties by declaring them to be  Worth little less than landing of a whale  Or Gades spoils  Cadiz was newly taken  or a churl's funerale  The allusion is to Spenser's Talus in the following couplet  Gird but the cynicke's helmet on his head  Cares he for Talus or his flayle of leade  He adds that the guilty person when marked destroys all distinction like the cuttlefish concealed in his own blackness  Long as the craftie cuttle lieth sure  In the blacke cloud of his thicke vomiture  Who list complaine of wronged faith or fame  When he may shift it to another's name  He thus describes the effect of his satire and the enjoyment of his own success in this species of poetry  Now see I fireflakes sparkle from his eyes  Like to a comet's tayle in th' angrie skies  His powting cheeks puft vp aboue his brow  Like a swolne toad touch'd with the spider's blow  His mouth shrinks sideways like a scornful playse  A fish Jonson says in the SILENT WOMAN  "Of a fool that would stand thus with a playsemouth c"  A i S ii See more instances in OLD PLAYS vol iii p edit    To

 B iv f    The second is the character of an old country squire who starves himself to breed his son a lawyer and a gentleman It appears that the vanity or luxury of purchasing dainties at an

"He hath a proper  gelded  parsonage"    He predicts with no small sagacity that Lollio's son's distant posterity will rack their rents to a treble proportion  And hedge in all their neighbours common lands  Enclosures of waste lands were among the great and national grievances of our author's age  Without attending to this circumstance we miss the meaning and humour of the following lines B v  Pardon ye glowing eares Needes will it out  Though brazen walls compass'd my tongue about  As thick as wealthy Scrobio's quickset rowes  In the wide common that he did enclose  Great part of the third satire of the same book turns on this idea  It may be presumed that the practice was then carried on with the most arbitrary spirit of oppression and monopoly  The third is on the pride of pedigree The introduction is from Juvenal's eighth satire and the substitution of the memorials of English ancestry such as were then fashionable in the place of Juvenal's parade of family statues without arms or ears is remarkably happy But the humour is half lost unless by recollecting the Roman original the reader perceives the unexpected parallel  Or call some old churchwindowe to record  The age of thy fair armes  Or find some figures half obliterate  In rainbeat marble neare to the churchgate  Upon a crosselegg'd tombe What boots it thee  To shewe the rusted buckle that did tie  The garter of thy

 Gallio may pull me roses ere they fall  Or in his net entrap the tennisball  Or tend his sparhawke mantling in her mewe  Or yelping beagles busy heeles pursue  Or watch a sinking corke vpon the shore

LETT ubi supr p Many more of his pieces might be recited    Having traced various scenes of dissatisfaction and the desultory pursuits of the world he comes home to himself and concludes that real happiness is only to be found in the academic life This was a natural conclusion from one who had experienced no other situation  In this Satire among the lying narratives of travellers our author with Mandeville and others mentions the SPANISH DECADS It is an old blackletter quarto a translation from the Spanish into English about In the old anonymous play of LINGUA Mendacio says  "Sir John Mandeviles trauells and great part of the DECADS were of my doing"  A ii S i    Mongst all these stirs of discontented strife  Oh let me lead an academick life  To know much and to think we nothing knowe  Nothing to haue yet think we haue enowe  In skill to want and wanting seeke for more  In weale nor want nor wish for greater store  B iv    The last of this Book is a satire on the pageantries of the papal chair and the superstitious practices of popery with which it is easy to make sport But our author has done this by an uncommon quickness of allusion poignancy of ridicule and fertility of burlesque invention Were Juvenal to appear at Rome he says  How his enraged ghost would stamp and stare  That Cesar's throne is turn'd to Peter's chaire  To see an old shorne lozel perched high  Crouching beneath a golden canopie  And for the lordly Fasces borne of old  To see two quiet crossed keyes of gold  But that he most would gaze and wonder at  Is th' horned mitre and the bloody hat  Cardinal's scarlet hat    The crooked staffe  Bishop's crosier  the coule's strange form and store  And multitude of them    Saue that he saw the same in hell before  The following ludicrous ideas are annexed to the exclusive appropriation of the eucharistic wine to the priest in the mass  The whiles the liquorous priest spits every trice  With longing for his morning sacrifice  Which he reares vp quite perpendiculare  That the mid church doth spight the chancel's fare  B iv    But this sort of ridicule is improper and dangerous It has a tendency even without an entire parity of circumstances to burlesque the celebration of this aweful solemnity in the reformed church In laughing at false religion we may sometimes hurt the true Though the rites of the papistic eucharist are erroneous and absurd yet great part of the ceremony and above all the radical idea belong also to the protestant communion  SECT XLVI  THE argument of the first satire of the fifth Book is the oppressive exaction of landlords the consequence of the growing decrease of the value of money One of these had perhaps a poor grandsire who grew rich by availing himself of the general rapine at the dissolution of the monasteries There is great pleasantry in one of the lines that he  Begg'd a cast abbey in the church's wayne  In the mean time the old patrimonial mansion is desolated and even the parishchurch unroofed and dilapidated through the poverty of the inhabitants and neglect or avarice of the patron  Would it not vex thee where thy sires did keep  Live inhabit    To see the dunged folds of dagtayl'd sheep  And ruin'd house where holy things were said  Whose freestone walls the thatched roofe vpbraid  Whose shrill saintsbell hangs on his lovery  While the rest are damned to the plumbery  The bells were all sold and melted down except that for necessary use the Saintsbell or  sanctusbell  was only suffered to remain within its  lovery  that is louver or turret usually placed between the chancel and body of the church Marston has  "pitchblack loueries"  SC VILLAN B ii    Yet pure devotion lets the steeple stand  And idle battlements on either hand c  Just to keep up the appearance of a church    By an enumeration of real circumstances he gives us the following lively draught of the miserable tenement yet ample services of a poor copyholder  Of one bay's breadth god wot a silly cote  Whose thatched spars are furr'd with sluttish soote  A whole inch thick shining like blackmoor's brows  Through smoke that downe the headlesse barrel blows  At his bed's feete feeden his stalled teame  His swine beneath his pullen oer the beame  A starued tenement such as I guesse  Stands straggling on the wastes of Holdernesse  Or such as shivers on a Peake hill side c  Yet must he haunt his greedy landlord's hall  With often presents at each festivall  With crammed capons euerie Newyeare's morne  Or with greene cheeses when his sheepe are shorne  Or many maundsfull  Maund is Basket Hence MAUNDAYThursday the Thursday in Passionweek when the king with his own hands distributes a large portion of alms c MAUNDAY is DIES SPORTULAE Maund occurs again B iv  With a  manud  charg'd with houshold marchandize  In the WHIPPINGE OF THE SATYRE Signat C  Whole MAUNDS and  baskets  ful of fine sweet praise  of his mellow fruite c  The lord's acceptance of these presents is touched with much humour  The smiling landlord shewes a sunshine face  Feigning that he will grant him further grace  And leers like Esop's foxe vpon the crane  Whose neck he craves for his chirurgian  B v  f    In the second  In this Satire there is an allusion to an elegant fiction in Chaucer v f  Certes if Pity dyed at Chaucer's date  Chaucer places the sepulchre of PITY in the COURT OF LOVE See COURT OF L v  A tender creature  Is shrinid there and PITY is her name  She saw an Egle wreke him on a Flie  And plucke his wing and eke him in his game  And tendir harte of that hath made her die  This thought is borrowed by Fenton in his MARIAMNE  he reprehends the incongruity of splendid edifices and worthless inhabitants  Like the vaine bubble of Iberian pride  That overcroweth all the world beside  The Escurial in Spain    Which rear'd to raise the crazy monarch's fame  Striues for a court and for a college name  Yet nought within but lousy coules doth hold  Like a scabb'd cuckow in a cage of gold  When  As when  Maevio's first page of his poesy  Nail'd to a hundred postes for nouelty  With his big title an Italian mot  i  In this age the three modern languages were studied to affectation In the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS above quoted a fashionable fop tells his Page  "Sirrah boy remember me when I come in Paul's Churchyard to buy a Ronsard and Dubartas in French an Aretin  in Italian and our hardest writers in Spanish c"  A ii Sc iii    Layes siege unto the backward buyer's grot c  He then beautifully drawes and with a selection of the most picturesque natural circumstances the inhospitality or rather desertion of an old magnificent rural mansion  Beat the broad gates a goodly hollow sound  With double echoes doth againe rebound  But not a dog doth bark to welcome thee  Nor churlish porter canst thou chafing see  All dumb and silent like the dead of night  Or dwelling of some sleepy Sybarite  The marble pavement hid with desart weed  With houseleek thistle dock and hemlockseed  Look to the towered chimnies which should be  The windpipes of good hospitalitie  Lo there th' unthankful swallow takes her rest  And fills the tunnell with her circled nest  The motto on the front of the house ΟΥΔΕΙΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ which he calls a fragment of Plato's poetry is a humorous alteration of Plato's ΟΥΔΕΙΣ ΑΚΑΘΑΡΤΟΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ    Afterwards the figure of FAMINE is thus imagined  Grim FAMINE sits in their forepined face  All full of angles of vnequal space  Like to the plane of manysided squares  That wont be drawne out by geometars  B v    In the third a satire is compared to the porcupine  The satire should be like the porcupine  That shoots sharp quills out in each angry line  B v    This ingenious thought though founded on a vulgar errour has been copied among other passages by Oldham Of a true writer of satire he says  He'd shoot his quills just like a porcupine  At view and make them stab in every line  APOLOGY for the foregoing ODE c WORKS vol i p edit mo    In the fourth and last of this Book he enumerates the extravagancies of a married spendthrift a farmer's heir of twenty pounds a year He rides with  two liveries  and keeps a pack of hounds  But whiles ten pound goes to his wife's new gowne  Not little less can serue to suite his owne  While one piece pays her idle waitingman  Or buys an hood or siluerhandled fan  Or hires a Friezeland trotter halfe yard deepe  To drag his tumbrell through the staring Cheape  B v    The last Book consisting of one long satire only is a sort of epilogue to the whole and contains a humorous ironical description of the effect of his satires and a recapitulatory view of many of the characters and foibles which he had before delineated But the scribblers seem to have the chief share The character of Labeo already repeatedly mentioned who was some cotemporary poet a constant censurer of our author and who from pastoral proceeded to heroic poetry is here more distinctly represented He was a writer who affected compound epithets which sir Philip Sydney had imported from France and first used in his ARCADIA  We have our author's opinion of Skelton in these lines of this satire f  Well might these checks have fitted former times  And shoulder'd angry Skelton's breathelesse rimes  The character in many respects suits Chapman though I do not recollect that he wrote any pastorals  That Labeo reades right who can deny  The true straines of heroick poesy  For he can tell how fury reft his sense  And Phebus fill'd him with intelligence  He can implore the heathen deities  To guide his bold and busy enterprise  Or filch whole pages at a clap for need  From honest Petrarch clad in English weed  While big BUT OH'S each stanza can begin  Whose trunk and taile sluttish and heartlesse been  He knowes the grace of that new elegance  Which sweet Philisides fetch'd late from France  That well beseem'd his highstil'd ARCADY  Though others marre it with much liberty  In epithets to joine two words in one  Forsooth for adjectives can't stand alone  The arts of composition must have been much practiced and a knowledge of critical niceties widely diffused when observations of this kind could be written He proceeds to remark it was now customary for every poet before he attempted the dignity of heroic verse to try his strength by writing pastorals  Though these lines bear a general sense yet at the same time they seem to be connected with the character of Labeo by which they are introduced By the  Carmelite  a pastoral writer ranked with Theocritus and Virgil he means Mantuan    But ere his Muse her weapon learn to wield  Or dance a sober Pirrhicke  The Pyrrhic dance performed in armour  in the field  The sheepecote first hath beene her nursery  Where she hath worne her idle infancy  And in high startups walk'd the pastur'd plaines  To tend her tasked herd that there remains  And winded still a pipe of oate or breare c  Poems on petty subjects or occasions on the death of a favourite bird or dog seem to have been as common in our author's age as at present He says  Should Bandell's throstle die without a song  Or Adamans my dog be laid along  Downe in some ditch without his exequies  In pursuance of the argument he adds  Folly itselfe or Boldnesse may be prais'd  An allusion to Erasmus's MORIAE ENCOMIUM and the ENCOMIUM CALVITIEI written at the restoration of learning Cardan also wrote an encomium on Nero the Gout c    Or epitaphs or mournful elegies  In this Satire Tarleton is praised as a poet who is most commonly considered only as a comedian Meres

elegant Latin amatorial and pastoral poet of Italy at the revival of learning    One is surprised to recollect that these satires are the production of a young man of twenty three They rather seem the work of an experienced master of long observation of study and practice in composition  They are recited among the best performances of the kind and with applause by Francis Meres a cotemporary critic  who wrote in  WIT  TREAS f It is extraordinary that they should not have afforded any  choice flowers  to ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS printed in  But whatever fame they had acquired it soon received a check which was never recovered They were condemned to the flames as licentious and immoral by an order of bishop Bancroft in And this is obviously the chief reason why they are not named by our author in the SPECIALITIES of his Life written by himself after his preferment to a bishoprick  SHAKING OF THE OLIVE or his Remaining Works to Nor are they here inserted  They were however admired and imitated by Oldham And Pope who modernised Donne is said to have wished he had seen Hall's satires sooner But had Pope undertaken to modernise Hall he must have adopted because he could not have improved many of his lines Hall is too finished and smooth for such an operation Donne though he lived so many years later was susceptible of modern refinement and his asperities were such as wanted and would bear the chissel  I was informed by the late learned bishop of Glocester that in a copy of Hall's Satires in Pope's library the whole first satire of the sixth book was corrected in the margin or interlined in Pope's own hadn and that Pope had written at the head of that satire OPTIMA SATIRA  Milton who had a controversy with Hall as I have observed in a remonstrance called an APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS published in rather unsuitably and disingenuously goes out of his way to attack these satires a juvenile effort of his dignified adversary and under every consideration alien to the dispute Milton's strictures are more sarcastic than critical yet they deserve to be cited more especially as they present a striking specimen of those aukward attempts at humour and raillery which disgrace his proseworks  "Lighting upon this title of TOOTHLESS SATYRS I will not conceal ye what I thought readers that sure this  must be some sucking satyr who might have done better to have used his coral and made an end of breeding ere he took upon him to wield a satyr's whip But when I heard him talk of  scouring the shields of elvish knights  A misquoted line in the DEFIANCE TO ENVY prefixed to the Satires I will give the whole passage which is a compliment to Spenser and shews how happily Hall would have succeeded in the majestic march of the long stanza  Or scoure the rusted swordes of Elvish knights  Bathed in pagan blood or sheathe them new  In mistie moral types or tell their fights  Who mighty giants or who monsters slew  And by some strange inchanted speare and shield  Vanquish'd their foe and won the doubtful field  May be she might in stately stanzas frame  Stories of ladies and aduenturous knights  To raise her silent and inglorious name  Vnto a reachlesse pitch of praise's hight  And somewhat say as more vnworthy done  That is  have  done    Worthy of brasse and hoary marble stone  do not blame me if I changed my thought and concluded him some desperate cutler But why his  scornful Muse could never abide with tragick shoes her ancles for to hide  B i  the pace of the verse told me that her mawkin knuckles were never shapen to that royal buskin And turning by chance to the sixth seventh Satyr of his second Book I was confirmed where having begun loftily in  heaven's universal alphabet  he falls down to that wretched poorness and frigidity as to talk of  Bridgestreet in heaven  and the  ostler of heaven  Hall supposes that the twelve signs of the zodiac are twelve inns in the highstreet of heaven  With twelve fayre signes  Euer well tended by our stardivines  Of the astrologers who give their attendance some are ostlers others chamberlaines c The zodiacal Sign AQUARIUS he supposes to be in the BRIDGESTREET of heaven He alludes to Bridgestreet at Cambridge and the signs are of inns at Cambridge  And there wanting other matter to catch him a heat for certain he was on the frozen zone miserably benummed with thoughts lower than any beadle's betakes him to whip the signposts of Cambridge alehouses the ordinary subject of freshmens tales and in a strain as pitiful Which for him  who would be counted the FIRST ENGLISH SATYRIST to abase himselfe to who might have learned better among the Latin and Italian Satyrists and in our own tongue from the VISION AND CREEDE OF PIERCE PLOWMAN besides others before him manifested a presumptuous undertaking with weak and unexamined shoulders For a Satyr is as it were born out of a Tragedy so ought to resemble his parentage to strike high and adventure dangerously at the most eminent vices among the greatest persons and not to creep into every blind taphouse that fears a constable more than a satyr But that such a poem should be TOOTHLESS I still affirm it to be a bull taking away the essence of that which it calls itself For if it bite neither the persons nor the vices how is it a satyr And if it bite either how is it toothless So that TOOTHLESS SATYRS are as much as if he had said TOOTHLESS TEETH c  APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS Milton's Proseworks vol i p edit Amst fol See also p  "  With Hall's SATIRES should be ranked his MUNDUS ALTER ET IDEM an ingenious satirical fiction in prose where under a pretended description of the TERRA AUSTRALIS he forms a pleasant invective against the characteristic vices of various nations and is remarkably severe on the church of Rome This piece was written about the year before he had quitted the classics for the fathers and published some years afterwards against his consent Under the same class should also be mentioned his CHARACTERISMES OF VERTUES a set of sensible and lively moral essays which contain traces of the satires  WORKS ut supr p Under the Character of the HYPOCRITE he says  "When a rimer reads

after the Gunpowderplot for it is mentioned p    I take the opportunity of observing here that among Hall's proseworks are some metaphrastic versions in metre of a few of David's Psalms  WORK  ut supr p In the DEDICATION he says  "Indeed my Poetry was long sithence out of date and yelded her place to grauer studies c"  In his EPISTLES he speaks of this unfinished undertaking  "Many great wits haue vndertaken this taskAmong the rest were those two rare spirits of the Sidnyes to whom poesie was as natvrall as it is affected of others and our worthy friend Mr Sylvester hath shewed me how happily he hath sometimes turned from his Bartas to the sweet singer of IsraelThere is none of all my labours so open to all censures Perhaps some think the verse harsh whose nice eare regardeth roundnesse more than sense I embrace smoothnesse but affect it not"  DEC ii Ep v p ut supr  and three anthems or hymns written for the use of his cathedral Hall in his Satires had condemned this sort of poetry  An able inquirer into the literature of this period has affirmed that Hall's Epistles written before the year  See WORKS ut supr p  are the first example of epistolary composition which England had seen  "Bishop Hall he says was not only our first satirist but was the first who brought epistolary writing to the view of the public which was common in that age to other parts of Europe but not practiced in England till he published his own Epistles  See Whalley's INQUIRY INTO THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE p  "  And Hall himself in the Dedication of his Epistles to Prince Henry observes  "Your grace shall herein perceiue a new fashion of discourse by EPISTLES new to our language vsuall to others and as nouelty is neuer without plea of vse more free more familiar  WORKS ut supr p The reader of Hall's SATIRES is referred to DEC vi Epist vi p  "  The first of our countrymen however who published a set of his own Letters though not in English was Roger Ascham who flourished about the time of the Reformation and when that mode of writing had been cultivated by the best scholars in various parts of Europe was celebrated for the terseness of  his epistolary style I believe the second published correspondence of this kind and in our own language at least of any importance after Hall will be found to be EPISTOLAE HOELIANAE or the Letters of James Howell a great traveller an intimate friend of Jonson and the first who bore the office of the royal historiographer which discover a variety of literature and abound with much entertaining and useful information  "EPISTOLAE HOELIANAE Familiar Letters Domestic and Foreign divided into sundry sections partly historical political and philosophical"  Lond to They had five editions from to inclusive A third and fourth volume was added

secundus  Cum duo sunt tantum est neuter et ambo pares  Lib ii Sig F In Davies's SCOURGE OF FOLLY there is an Epigram to  "The acute Mr John Marston"  on his comedy of the MALECONTENT p    In general it is not easy to give a specimen of Marston's satires as his strongest lines are either openly vitiated with gross expression or pervaded with a hidden vain of impure sentiment The following humorous portrait of a sick inamorato is in his best at least in his chastest manner of drawing a character  For when my eares receau'd a fearfull sound  That he was sicke I went and there I found  Him laide of loue  The midwife's phrase  and newly brought to bed  Of monstrous folly and a franticke head  His chamber hang'd about with elegies  With sad complaints of his loue's miseries  His windows strow'd with sonnets and the glasse  Drawne full of loueknotts I approacht the asse  And straight he weepes and sighes some sonnet out  To his faire loue And then he goes about  For to perfvme her rare perfection  With some sweetsmelling pinkepitheton  Then with a melting looke he writhes his head  And straight in passion riseth in his bed  And hauing kist his hand strok'd vp his haire  Made a French congè cryes  O cruell Faire  To th' antique bedpost  In these lines there is great elegance of allusion and vigour of expression He addresses the objects of his satire as the sons of the giants  Is Minos dead is Rhadamanth asleepe  That thus ye dare vnto Ioue's palace creepe  What hath Rhamnusia spent her knotted whip  That ye dare striue on Hebe's cup to sip  Yet know Apollo's quiuer is not spent  But can abate your daring hardiment  Python is slaine yet his accursed race  Dare looke diuine Astrea in the face  SAT    In the same satire he calls himself  A beadle to the world's impuritie  Marston seems to have been the poetic rival of Hall at Cambridge whom he repeatedly censures or ridicules In the fourth satire he supposes Hall's criticisms on Dubartas the versions of David's Psalms by Sternhold and king James Southwell's MARY and SAINT PETER'S TEARS the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES and other pieces of equal reputation to be the production of pedantry or malignity And the remainder of this satire is no unpleasant parody of Hall's prefatory stanzas against envy  It appears from the SCOURGE OF VILLANIE that Hall had caused a severe Epigram to be pasted on the last page of every copy of Marston's PIGMALION'S IMAGE that was sent from London to the booksellers of Cambridge B iii The Epigram is there cited This tenth satire of the third Book was added in the second edition in It is addressed  "to his very friend maister E G"  One Edward Gilpin is cited in ENGLAND'S PARNASSUS  It appears from this Satire that the devices on shields and banners at tournaments were now taken from the classics  He who upon his glorious scutchion  Can quaintly show wits newe inuention  Advancing forth some thirstie Tantalus  Or els the vulture on Prometheus  With some short motto of a dozen

Marston's allusions often want truth and accuracy In describing the ruff of a beau he says  His ruffe did eate more time in neatest setting  Than Woodstockworke in painfull perfecting  The comparison of the workmanship of a laced and plaited ruff to the laboured nicety of the steelwork of Woodstock is just He adds with an appearance of wit  It hath more doubles farre than Ajax shield  This was no exaggeration The shield of Ajax was only sevenfold To say nothing of one of the leading ideas the delicacy of contexture which could not belong to such a shield  But Marston is much better known as a satirist by a larger and a separate collection yet entirely in the strain of the last called the SCOURGE OF VILLANY published the same year I will give the title exactly and at length  "The SCOVRGE OF

appellation of KINSAYDER by which he is recognised among other cotemporary poets in the RETURN FROM PARNASSUS In his metrical introduction he wishes all readers of fashion would pass over his poetry and rather examine the playbills pasted on every post or buy some ballad about the fairy king and king Cophetua and the female beggar Instead of a Muse he invocates REPROOF in this elegant and animated address  I inuocate no Delian deitie  Nor sacred offspring of Mnemosyne  I pray in aid of no Castalian Muse  No Nymph no female angell to infuse  A sprightly wit to raise my flagging wings  And teach me tune these harsh discordant strings  I craue no Syrens of our halcyontimes  To grace the accents of my roughhew'd rimes  But grim Reproofe sterne Hate of villany  Inspire and guide a satyr's poesie  Faire Detestation of fowle odious sinne  In which our swinish times lie wallowing  Be thou my conduct and my Genius  My wit's inticing sweetbreath'd Zephirus  Oh that a satyr's hand had force to pluck  Some floodgate vp to purge the world from muck  Would god I could turne Alpheus' riuer in  To purge this Augean stable from fowle sinne  Well I will tryAwake Impuritie  And view the vaile drawne from thy villanie  B iii PROEM    The passage reminds us of a witty line in Young's UNIVERSAL PASSION I know not if borrowed from hence  And cleanse the Augean stable with thy quill  There is a thought like this in Dekker's GULS HORNE BOOKE p  "To pvrge the world will be a sorer labour than the cleansing of Augeas' stable or the scouring of Mooreditch"    Part of the following nervous paragraph has been copied either by Dryden or Oldham  Who would not shake a satyr's knotty rod  When to defile the sacred name of god  Is but accounted gentlemen's disport  To snort in filth each hower to resort  To brothellpits alas a veniall crime  Nay royal to be last in thirtieth slime  B i    In an invocation to RIME while he is not inelegantly illustrating the pleasingness of an easy association of consonant syllables he artfully intermixes the severities of satire  Come prettie pleasing symphonie of words  Ye wellmatch'd twins whose liketun'd tongue affords  Such musicall delight come willingly  And daunce Levoltos  An old fashionable dance Hanmer on Shakespeare defines it to be a dance in which there was much capering and turning HEN V A iii S v The word implies more  capering  than turning  in my poesie  Come all as easie as spruce Curio will  In some courthall to shew his capering skill  As willingly as wenches trip around  About a maypole to the bagpipe's sound  Let not my ruder hand  Seeme once to force you in my lines to stand  Be not so fearefull prettie soules to meete  As Flaccus is the sergeant's face to greete  Be not so backwardloth to grace my sense  As Drusus is to haue intelligence  His dad's aliue but come into my head  As iocundly as when his wife was dead  Young Lelius to his home Come likefac'd Rime  In tunefull number's keeping musick's

soulepleasing highinfused art  B ii AD RITHMUM    He thus wages war with his brotherbards especially the dreamers in fairy land  Here's one must inuocate some looseleg'd dame  Some brotheldrab to help him stanzas frame  Another yet dares tremblingly come out  But first he must inuoke good COLIN CLOUT  Spenser as a pastoral writer    Yon's one hath yean'd a fearefull prodigy  Some monstrous and

Thou nursing  mother of faire wisdom's lore  Ingenuous Melancholy  PROEM B i    He supposes himself talking with Esop and alludes to the story of his coming into the streets of Athens to  look for a

find myself obliged to refrain from producing any more citations There are however a few more passages which may safely be quoted but which I choose to reserve for future illustration  There is a carelessness and laxity in Marston's versification but there is a freedom and facility which Hall has too frequently missed by labouring to confine the sense to the couplet Hall's measures are more musical not because the music of verse consists in uniformity of pause and regularity of cadence Hall had a correcter ear and his lines have a tuneful strength in proportion as his language is more polished his phraseology more select and his structure more studied Hall's meaning among other reasons is not always so soon apprehended on account of his compression both in sentiment and diction Marston is more perspicuous as he thinks less and writes hastily Hall is superiour in penetration accurate conception of character acuteness of reflection and the accumulation of thoughts and images Hall has more humour Marston more acrimony Hall often draws his materials from books and the diligent perusal of other satirists Marston from real life Yet Hall has a larger variety of characters He possessed the talent of borrowing with address and of giving originality to his copies On the whole Hall is more elegant exact and elaborate  It is Marston's misfortune that he can never keep clear of the impurities of the brothel His stream of poetry if sometimes bright and unpolluted almost always betrays a muddy bottom The satirist who too freely indulges himself in the display of that licentiousness which he means to proscribe absolutely defeats his own design He inflames those passions which he professes to suppress gratifies the depravations of a prurient curiosity and seduces innocent minds to an acquaintance with ideas which they might never have known  The satires of Hall and Marston were condemned to the same flame and by the same authority But Hall certainly deserved a milder sentence Hall exposes vice not in the wantonness of description but with the reserve of a cautious yet lively moralist Perhaps every censurer of obscenity does some harm by turning the attention to an immodest object But this effect is to be counteracted by the force and propriety of his reproof by shewing the pernicious consequences of voluptuous excesses by suggesting motives to an opposite conduct and by making the picture disgustful by dashes of deformity When Vice is led forth to be sacrificed at the shrine of virtue the victim should not be too richly dressed  SECT XLVIII  THE popularity of Hall's and Marston's Satires notwithstanding their proscription or rather extermination by spiritual authority produced an innumerable crop of SATIRISTS and of a set of writers differing but little more than in name and now properly belonging to the same species EPIGRAMMATISTS  In printed at London appeared  "SKIALETHEIA or a Shadowe of Truth in certaine Epigrams and

admonition to the City of Oxford or Mareplate's Bastardine"  In this piece says Wood he  "reflects upon all persons of note in Oxford who were guilty of amorous exploits or that mixed themselves with other men's wives or with wanton houswives in Oxon"  The other is a disavowal of this lampoon written after his expulsion and beginning  Jenkin why man  c See Meres WITS TR f  By the patronage or

which Spenser had prefixed the undeserved honour of a recommendatory sonnet now equally forgotten  Meres who wrote in observes  "As Horace Lucilius Juvenal Persius and Lucullus are the best for SATYRE among the Latins so with us in the same faculty these are chiefe Piers PLOWMAN Lodge Hall of Emanuel colledge in Cambridge the author of PIGMALION'S IMAGE AND CERTAINE SATYRES  Marston's SCOURGE OF

Rankins Nor have I seen Lodge's Satires unless his  "ALARUM AGAINST USURERS containing tried experiences against worldly abuses"  and its appendix his History of Forbonius and Prisaeria printed at London in may be considered under that character  Wood also a great dealer in the works of our old minor poets yet at the same time a frequent transcriber from Meres still more embarrasses this matter where he says that Lodge after he left Trinity college at Oxford about the year and  "had spent some time in exercising his fancy among the poets in the great city he was esteemed not Joseph Hall of Emanuel college excepted the best for satyr among English men  ATH OXON i  "  Lodge was fitted for a different mode of composition He was chiefly noted for pastorals madrigals and sonnets and for his EUPHUES GOLDEN LEGACY which furnished the plot of the AS YOU LIKE IT of Shakespeare In an extended acceptation many of the prosepamphlets written about this period by Greene and Decker which paint or expose popular foibles and fashions particularly Decker's GUL'S HORNBOOK a manual or directory for initiating an unexperienced spendthrift into the gaieties of the metropolis might claim the appellation of satires  Harrrington in his Epigrams mentions the Satires of a poet whom he often attacks under the name of Lynus B i  His Distickes SATYRES Sonnets and Hexameters  His Epigrams his Lyricks and Pentameters  And again he has an Epigram  "Against a foolish Satyrist called Lynus"  B i See also B i  That the rage of writing satires and satirical epigrams continued long will appear from a piece of some humour called  "An Inquisition against Paperpersecutors"  written in  By A H Lond for H H p At the end of  "A Scourge for Paperpersecutors by I D"  And shall it still be so Nor

was LITTLEBRITAIN abounded with shops and stalls of booksellers that its steeple was thrown down by lightening in and that a general reparation of the church was now become a great object of the nation  But of this more distinct proofs will appear in the progress of our history  It must not be forgotten that a second impression of an English version of Ariosto's Satires which contain many anecdotes of his life and circumstances and some humourous tales and which are marked with a strong vein of free reprehension but with much less obscenity than might be expected from satires written by the author of ORLANDO FURIOSO appeared in long verse by an anonymous translator in  "Ariosto's SEVEN PLANETS gouerning Italie Or his Satyrs in seuen famous discourses c Newly corrected and augmented c With a new edition of three most excellent ELEGIES written by the same Lodovico Ariosto"  By W Stan  by to I believe this title gave rise to the following  "A Booke of the seuen planets or

that Ariosto's title gave rise to  "The Philosophers Satyrs or the Philosophers Seven Satyrs alluding to the seuen Planets c"  By Robert Anton of Magdalene college Cambridge Lond to It may be sufficient to have mentioned these Satires here  I believe these satires are but little known or esteemed by the Italians  For the sake of juxtaposition I will here anticipate in throwing together the titles of some others of the most remarkable collections of satires and satirical epigrams published between and meaning to consider hereafter those that best deserve more critically and distinctly  I

companion  An Inquisition against paperpersecutors  in the year as I have just noticed  Owen's idea of an epigram points out the notion which now prevailed of this kind of composition and shews the propriety of blending the epigrams and satires of these times under one class A satire he says is an epigram on a larger scale Epigrams are only satires in miniature An epigram must be satyrical and a satire epigrammatical  Robert Hayman above quoted thus recommends his own Epigrams QUODLIBETS B iv p  Epigrams are like Satyrs rough without  Like chesnuts sweet take thou the kernell out  And Jonson in the Dedication of his EPIGRAMS to Lord Pembroke was so far from viewing this species of verse in its original plan as the most harmless and inoffensive species of verse that he supposes it to be conversant above  the likenesse of vice and facts  and is conscious that epigrams  carry danger in the sound  Yet in one of his epigrams addressed TO THE MEERE ENGLISH CENSVRER  he professes not exactly to follow the track of the late and most celebrated epigrammatists  To thee my way in EPIGRAMMES seemes newe  When both it is the old way and the true  Thou saist that cannot be for thou hast

thou doubtest  utrum horum mavis  In Dunbar's Latin Epigrams published there is a compliment to Davies of Hereford author of the SCOURGE OF FOLLY as a Satyrist or epigrammatist CENT xx p    This however discovers the opinion of the general reader  Of the popularity of the epigram about the year if no specimens had remained a proof may be drawn together with evidences of the nature of the composition from Marston's humourous character of Tuscus a retailer of wit  But roome for Tuscus that iestmoungering youth  Who neer did ope his apish gerning mouth  But to retaile and broke another's
