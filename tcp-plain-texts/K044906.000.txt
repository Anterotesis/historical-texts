THE pride of all nature was sweet  Willy O    The first of all swains  He gladden'd the plains  None ever was like to sweet  Willy O  II  He sung it so rarely did sweet  Willy O    He melted each maid  So skillful he play'd  No shepherd e'er pip'd like the sweet  Willy O  III  All Nature obey'd him this sweet  Willy O    Wherever he came  Whate'er had a name  Whenever he sung follow'd sweet  Willy O    IV  He won'd be a  Writer of Tragedy  soldier this sweet  Willy O    When arm'd in the field  With sword and with shield  The laurel was won by the sweet  Willy O  V  He charm'd 'em when living the sweet  Willy O    And when  Willy  dy'd  'Twas Nature that sigh'd  To part with her all in her sweet  Willy O  SHAKESPEARE'S MULBERRYTREE  Sung with a Cup in his Hand made of the Tree  By Mr G  I  BEHOLD this fair goblet 'twas carv'd from the tree  Which O my sweet SHAKESPEARE was planted by thee  As a relick I kiss it and bow at the shrine  What comes from thy hand must be ever divine  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree  Bend to thee  Blest Mulberry  Matchless was he  Who planted thee  And thou like him immortal be  II  Ye trees of the forest so rampant and high  Who spread round their branches whose heads sweep the sky  Ye curious exotics whom taste has brought here  To root out the natives at prices so dear  All shall yield to the Mulberytree c c  III  The Oak is held royal is  Britain  's great boast  Preserv'd once our king and will always our coast  But of Fir we make ships we have thousands that fight  While One only One like our SHAKESPEARE can write  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  IV  Let  Venus  delight in her gay mirtle bowers  Pomona  in fruit trees and  Flora  in flowers  The garden of SHAKESPEARE all fancies will suit  With the sweetest of flowers and fairest of fruit  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  V  With learning and knowledge the wellletter'd Birch  Supplies Law and Physick and Grace for the church  But Law and the Gospel in SHAKESPEARE we find  And he gives the best Physick for body and mind  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  VI  The fame of the patron gives fame to the tree  From him and his merits this takes its degree  Let  Phoebus  and  Bacchus  their glories resign  Our tree shall surpass both the Laurel and Vine  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  VII  The Genius of SHAKESPEARE outshines the bright day  More rapture than wine to the heart can convey  So the tree which he planted by making his own  Has Laurel and Bays and the Vine all in one  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree c c  VIII  Then each take a relick of this hallow'd tree  From folly and fashion a charm let it be  Fill fill to the planter the cup to the brim  To honour the country do honour to him  All shall yield to the Mulberrytree  Bend to thee  Blest Mulberry  Matchless was he  Who planted thee  And thou like him immortal be  ROUNDELAY  N B The Stanzas marked with a * are omitted in the singing  For the Jubilee in

abroad through all the  Fairy  nation  Mab  to her loving subjectsA decree  At SHAKESPEARE's tomb to hold a Jubilee  ACCOMPANIED  The night was come and now on  Avon  's side  The pigmy race was seen  Attended by their queen  On chafers some and some on crickets ride  The queen appear'd from far  Mounted in a nut shell carr  Six painted ladybirds the carriage drew  And now the cavalcade  In order due array'd  March'd first  Where erst  The sacred Mulb'ry grew  And there their homage paid  Next they sought the holy ground  And while  A thousand glowworm torches glimmer'd round  Thus  Good Fellow  the herald of his fame  Did from the alabaster height proclaim  The poets titles and his stile  AIR  SHAKESPEARE heaven's most favor'd creature  Truest copier of Nature  First of the Parnassian train  Chiefest fav'rite of the muses  Which soe'er the poet chooses  Blest alike in ev'ry strain  Life's great censor and inspector  Fancy's treasurer Wit's director  Artless to the shame of art  Master of the various passions  Leader of all inclinations  Sov'reign of the human heart  RECITATIVE  Then did the queen an acorn take  Fill'd with morn and ev'ning dew  Brush'd from ev'ry fragrant brake  That round the lawns of  Stratford  grew  ACCOMPANIED  And thus said she libation do I make  To our friend and father's shade  'Twas SHAKESPEARE that the  Fairies  made  And men shall give us honour for his sake  AIR  O happy bard whose potent skill  Can give existence where it will  Let giant wisdom strive to chase  From man's belief the Fairy race  Religion stern our pow'r reject  Philosophy our tales neglect  Only trusting what 'tis seeing  Combat us howe'er they list  In thy scenes we shall exist  Sure as if Nature gave us being  THE COUNTRY GIRL  A COMIC SERENATA  By Mr G  RECITATIVO  PRITHEE tell me cousin  Sue    Why they make so much to do  Why all this noise and clatter  Why all this hurry all this bustle  Law how they crowd and bawl and justle  I caunno' guess the matter  For whom must all this puther be  The Emperor of  Garmanee    Or Great Mogul is coming  Such eating drinking dancing singing  Such Cannon firing bells a ringing  Such trumpetting and drumming  AIR  All this for a PoetO no  Who liv'd lord knows how long ago  How can you jeer one  How can you fleer one  A poet a poet O no  'Tis not so  Who liv'd lord knows how long ago  It must be some great man  A prince or a stateman  It can't be a poetO no  Your poet is poor  And nobody sure  Regards a poor poet I trow  The rich ones we prize  Send 'em up to the skies  But not a poor poetO no  Who liv'd lord knows how long ago  RECITATIVO  Yet now I call to mind  Our larned doctor boasted  One SHIKSPUR did of all mankind  Receive from heav'n the mosthead  That he could wonders do  And did 'em o'er and o'er  Raise sprites and lay 'em too  The like ne'er seen before  A conjurer was he  Who with a pen in hond  Had earth and air and sea  And all things at commaund  AIR    O'er each heart he was ruler  Made 'em warmer or cooler  Could make 'em to laugh or to cry  What we lock'd in our breasts  Tho' as close as in Chests  Was not hid from the conjuror's eye  Tho' sins I have none  I am glad he is gone  No maid could live near such a mon  II  If he sew ye be knew ye  Would look thro' and thro' ye  Thro' skin and your flesh and your cloaths  Had you vanity pride  Fifty follies beside  He would see 'em as plain as your nose  Tho' sins I have none  I am glad he is gone  No maid would live near such a mon  III  Let us sing it and dance it  Rejoice it and prance it  That no man has now such an art  What would come of us all  Both the great ones and small  Should he live to peep now in each heart  Tho' sins I have none  I am glad he is gone  No maid could live near such a mon  FINIS
