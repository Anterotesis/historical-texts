 A PETITION TO THE Right Hon Mr In FAVOUR of Mr  MACLEAN  By a LADY  LONDON Printed for G SMITH near  Temple Bar Fleetstreet    A PETITION TO THE Right Hon Mr In FAVOUR of Mr  MACLEAN  _IF ever Statesman melted at Distress  Nor chose to make it More instead of Less  If they retain a Sense of human Things  And deign to look on Mortals down from Kings  List list oh whom Three Realms obey  To the sad Purport of my weeping Lay  Ah how I dread least crowding on some Hour  That twists confus'd th' intricate Web of Pow'r  Hiding those slender Threads that lead us still  Letting the Puppets think they act at Will  Or if unhappily on one I press  More serious how to keep One's Self in Place  Nay I might fear though this should meet your Eyes  When only Monarchs linger for Replies  Yet they perhaps would wait when Ladies write  For Foreigners they say are all polite  And strange Effect of breathing diff'rent Air  Reward the Brave and reverence the Fair  You should to  Rts  send my unread Griefs  Deputies are more difficult than Chiefs  Perhaps he'd see with Joy my  Maclean  's Fall  Such Little People envy one so Tall  No may this find thee when thy Soul's unbent  And laughs to think how easy's Government  When frugal E lends her still Retreat  Or verdant Gh her pacific Seat  Or thy pleas'd Eye athwart the G Pk rolls  Peeping thro' L  C's PigeonHoles  Gently dissolv'd in Unconcern the same  As when to  Derby  the Banditti came  Yet still I run one Risque what can be worse  You'll think it Begging 'cause it is in Verse  Too sure we beg for Life we beg 'tis true  If we had robb'd enough we need not sue  We own our Guilt with Tears Contritionsent  Oh let it hurt us not that we repent  What can we else happy who Law defies  In compleat Armour of past Services  H  m Teas and Brandies run at  L  w  's shall sheild  And stain'd  Ferrara  on C  n Field  True he robb'd We and gave unmeant Fire  The PatriotPistol took him for his Sire  Say he design'd it had the Ball took place  And slain one Victim of devoted Race  'Tis not so long since this had met Applause  From Virtue and the Friends to Virtue's Cause  Tho' Doctrine's fall before the Scythe of Time  Shall his believing what they taught be Crime  We dug no Favours in his Father's Mine  His lib'ral Hand to us was clos'd as thine  Unplac'd unpension'd as in Bribes unshar'd  What Gratitude to rob the Son debarr'd  But had he given us Riches Rank and Name  And we'd attack'd his Life and robb'd his Fame  You'd punish in one Culprit with what Face  What's the sole Merit of some Men in Place  We spoil'd the  Scot  and would not hide the Deed  Th' Attempt was great 'twas glorious to succeed  'Twas Conquest and not Robbery A Crime  No needless Law says punish in our Time  But make us thankful that no Soul was harm'd  Oh never more let gentle Ls go arm'd  Our great Mishap is private Theft too long  The Publick's not so sensible of Wrong  Capricious Mistress on the first she pours  Her Vengeance and Rewards on t'other show'rs  Brav'ry on  Hounslow  with a Gibbet pays  While look'don Seafights to new Honours raise  Would Tyrant Custom but so far recede  That for  Maclean  we might in Person plead  A hundred Hoops thy LeveeRoom should crowd  Nay shudder not indeed we'd not be loud  We've other Eloquence than stuns the Bar  With dreadful Din of counterfeited War  Could you but see the Face our Sorrow wears  In silent Energy of Female Tears  The Prevalence of Beauty you should own  Nor L  y C knit one jealous Frown  Let selfish Man jostle for Power and Place  Barter his Vote turn Patriot lie caress  Sincerer Woman has a nobler End  Unknown to Levees'tis to serve a Friend  Oh happy  France  where Women interfere  And claim in Government their legal Share  Controul the Minister advise debate  Ride on the Council and direct the State  There Beauty often pacifies the Law  And tears a Fav'rite from its Iron Jaw  There the stern Judge remits the forfeit Life  T' a handsome Cousin or a lovely Wife  But  English  Men of Business know us ill  Think Pudding th' utmost Efforts of our Skill  Us but Companions for the trifling Vein  And form'd to Satisfy not Entertain  Yet what we may to Thee I write  And almost dry my Tears and blame my Fright  Reflecting in Politeness you as well  As in your Politics the  French  excell  And Heav'nborn Mercy can't from him be far  Who seal'd with Peace the Lyonmouth of War  That Hand by which this prostrate Island rose  From her sunk Fame tremendous to her Foes  Will not be slow to raise the suppliant Fair  Saving  Maclean  proves the whole
