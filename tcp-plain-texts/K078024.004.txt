which  were white become black by the same process in this caterpillar we have observed a similar change a specimen which was of a plain green as before described became suddenly spotted with black as shewn in our plate that skin being cast off it assumed its former appearance and became a pupa  It feeds on grass nettles c near the sides of ditches and is found sporting in the evening when in the fly state among the grass and herbage  The Caterpillar becomes a Pupa about the beginning of JuneIt affixes itself by the tail to a stalk of grass in the same manner as those of the Butterfly genus and like them is often found with the head suspended downwards it can by a sudden spring turn itself upright again  In a little book entitled the AURELIAN'S POCKET COMPANION by Moses Harris we find this species described and called the  White Plumed  but the Linnaean specified Name  Didactyla  is addedAnd under the Linnaean name Pentadactyla our present specimen he has described the  Brown plumed  Another specimen of the same division of the genus  Aluctae  but of a brown colour "Alis fissis fuscis c"  Linn  The same confusion is extended to his folio work the AURELIAN In Plate he has figured the White plumed under the specific name Didactyla and in Plate the Brown plume under Pentadactyla Linnaeus has comprised all those Lepi∣dopterous Insects whose wings appear to consist of several distinct feathers connected only at the shafts under the subdivision  Aluctae  but Fabricius has given them the new name PTEROPHORUS and added the name Alucitae to a small division of the

wonderful instinct that directs the smallest Insects to provide for the safety of their future progeny never fails to strike the attention of the inquisitive researcher into their oeconomyTo perpetuate their  race is the great end of their being and the most astonishing effort of their ingenuity and care is employed to perfect this grand design We not only find innumerable eggs and larvae of Insect on all kinds of plants in all standing waters and in animal matter when putrid but many which can only be hatched from the egg by the warmth of living animals thus the Tabanus pierces the thick hide of the Cow and plunges its eggs into the flesh the heat and moisture of which nourishes both in the egg and larva the Hippobosca equina pro∣trudes its eggs into the  rectum  of Horses and the Ichneumon into living Caterpillars to those we could add many remarkable instances of Insects who have shewn a lower species of perception by deposit∣ing their eggs in places where the larvae would find abundance of proper food and with such ingenious contrivances for their safety in a defenceless state as we could only expect from the sagacity of larger animals but it is only our intention to premise with those general re∣marks lest the subject we have chosen for our present Plate should be considered as a solitary example of such ingenuity and care towards their future offspring  The Natural History of the Common Bee has been both fully and ably treated of by  Schirach Maraldi Reaumur Debraw  and other authors of respectability and may be supposed to be pretty generally known by those conversant in rural affairs the manners however of other species of the same genus has neither been so fully explained nor examined they yet present a fund for the enquiries of the Na∣turalist equally worthy his attention though less beneficial as the honey they make cannot be converted to our use  Among the solitary Bees some penetrate into the earth scoop out hollow cavities then polish the sides within and deposit their eggs with proper food for the larvae till it becomes a Pupa Others form nests of loose sand which they glue together with a strong cement those nests are generally formed against walls that are exposed to the south without they are rude and irregular but within are very neatly finished and divided into several cells or apartments in each of which the Parent Bee lodges an egg Of our present and a few other species we may say  In firmest oak they scoop a spacious tomb  And lay their embryo in the spurious womb  Brookes on Universal Beauty    We find this season the Apis Centuncularis has done considerable injury among the Timber Plantations in  Essex  and we have similar information from some parts of  Cambridgeshire  A Gentleman sent me early in the Spring a piece of Oak containing a quantity of the larva from his plantation at  Birdbrook  in  Essex  He informs me several Gentlemen in his neighbourhood had found large trunks of apparently healthy Oaks completely perforated and filled with the larva of this mischievous Insect in many instances the trunk had been materially injured and the cases were arranged as shewn by the hori∣zontal Section at Fig in our PlateThe perforations were in a longitudinal direction several feet through the solid timber and when the leaves were fresh appeared as shewn at Fig  The Insect commences its operation at the upper part of the trunk of the tree then boring in an oblique direction for about two inches or more it follows a longitudinal course it divides the ligneous fibres or threads till it forms the diameter of the cavity which is about threeeighths of an inch its depth various sometimes only a few inches at others considerably more when the cavity is entirely formed and all the dust and fragments cleared away it finishes the sides perfectly smooth the hardest knot in the timber being insufficient to resist the strength of its jawsThe cavity when finished appears divided by slight ridges placed at the distance of about three quarters of an inch from each other this serves to regulate the size of each apartment or cell and it now only remains to be lined for the reception of the egg this lining is generally composed of roseleaves and is applied to the apartments in a very curious manner the Parent Bee flies with a leaf to the orifice of the perforation where she clips it round to the size of the hole this is forced to the bottom of the lowest cell about seven eight or ten of such pieces form the first layer it next forms the sides or cylindrical part of the lining this is done by laying several whole leaves partly over each  other as shewn in our Plate and cementing them together with a glutinous substance thus the sides and bottom each consisting of several layers being finished in the form of a thimble the Bee partly fills it with a kind of paste then throws over it a small quantity of leaves reduced to powder and deposits the egg the covering to the whole is formed of the same materials and in the same manner as the bottom when she has forced about ten or fifteen circular pieces of leaves into the avenue and cemented them to the top the covering is completed and the egg is completely secured from accidentThe covering separated is shewn in the Plate at fig the larvae at fig  In this manner she proceeds with and finishes every cell distinctly till the perforation is entirely filled in some trees forty or fifty such perforations are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other The Bee comes forth late in August if the lowest is formed before those above it eats its way up the channel through their cases  Mr  Adams  in his Essay on the Microscope mentions a remarkable circumstance of a Bee we suspect of this species "A friend of mine says he had a piece of wood cut from a strong post  We learn this post was fir  that supported the roof of a carthouse full of these cells or round holes threeeighths of an inch diameter and about threefourths deep each of which was filled with these roseleaf cases finely covered in at top and bottom"  PLATE CXXI CURCULIO COLEOPTERA  Wings two Covered by two Shells

should only be considered as a variety of Curculio Argentatus Much of its beautiful appearance depends on the time we take it in when first hatched its colours are very rich and highly glossed with gold but it gradually becomes dirty brown or almost black  The cause of this alteration in its appearance is easily perceived by the microscope the first or ground colour is dark brown but is entirely covered with oblong scales of various beautiful colours particularly of a reddish gold or bronze interspersed with those of green and brown colour when the Insect is first hatched the scales lay over each other so as to conceal the ground colour but as they rub off or are otherwise injured the brown becomes the general colourThey vary also very much from red to  yellow or green hues when first hatched and are sometimes found late in the season with almost every scale rubbed off  Linnaeus and Fabricius say it is found on Pear trees  Habitat in Pyri foliis in Corrolis declaratus  Lina  We

country and probably lives concealed in the crevices of the tree or under the rotten part of the bark The number of new Insects that have been discovered in this country within a few years  Among the rarities met with last summer we may particularly mention the Pha∣laena Delphinii  Pease Blossom Moth  This very beautiful Insect was taken by a Gentle∣man at Chelsea it was never ascertained before to be an English Insect  renders it not improbable that future English Entomologists by extending their enquiries may find many more of the species that are now met with in the northern and per∣haps

shew how very liable this Insect is to variation in its colours size c  We find also that though this Insect has been named Phalaena Anastomosis in the most scientific Cabinets in London and always received as such by the best authority it is not the Insect referred to by Fabricius in his Species Insectorum under that title that Author as well as Linnaeus refers under the specific name  Ph Curtula  to the d Plate of the third Volume of Roesel's Insects in this Plate is figured a Moth which is certainly a species distinct from our Insect and is well known by its Linnaean name  Curtula

markings and general appearance correspond with our speci∣men though its colours are totally different being a very pale grey with scarcely any dark colour near the apex of the wings the larva much more resembles our figure and induces us to conclude that though the figure of this last Moth is so extremely different it is probably intended for the same species as our Insect and therefore that the two distinct species have been confounded together by a false quotation of Linnaeus's Amanuensis  And we are partly confirmed in this supposition by the words of Linnaeus himself he says  Ph Anastomosis  is very like  Ph Curtula  but the Moth figured in Roesel's plate and referred to in the Syno∣nyms under Anastomosis does not bear the least resemblance to it our Insect on the contrary

grass and other herbage to keep it moist She is furnished with a sharp double edged sheath like a  sword  with which she opens the ground in a perpendicular direction first scooping out a convenient cylindrical aperture and then widening the lower part into a spacious apartment for the re∣ception of the eggs  See  Fig I  When the Insect bursts from the egg it is very minute and with∣out Wings in

or other thinly covered parts and dart their sharp pointed trunks or proboscis into the flesh we have observed the sting of this Insect to be most severe about midday particularly when the sun shines bright and emits much heat a disagreeable sensation continues in the stung part for some time and is generally succeeded by a large tumor and a slight discharge of pungent fluid before it disappears

lips and contains a longitudinal horny convex blade the acute point of which is concealed between these lips this interior tube when examined with a Microscope appears to consist of three others exceedingly sharp at the points and are used by the Insect as lancets to lacerate the flesh when it feeds while it pumps or sucks up the blood and moisture from the wound through the capillary tubes
