Thomas  waiting behind country lads and lasses at a distance singing chorus as the curtain rises  CHORUS  HERE we sing dance and play  Nor perceive the blithe day  Is departing when gliding so smoothly away  Compton  Let poets still carol the beauties of Spring  And lovelorn shepherds of summer may sing  'Tis Autumn bestows full fruition of joy  Rich treasure sweet pleasure that never can cloy  Sir Felix  The yellow leaf falling presents the wise page  That bids us lay up for our winter of age  While labour subsiding still sweetens repose  And our wealth rosy health from industry flows  Here we sing c  Sir Felix  There there get you gone all to the lawn and be as merry as good cheer strong beer and the pipe and tabour can make you  Peasants  Long life and happy days to our master sir Felix  Exeunt  peasants  Sir Felix  O Compton I'm so happy today Isn't that your old servant Thomas  Compton  Ay sir Felix now my only servant fidelity roots the poor fellow in a barren soil  Sir Felix  Desire Lingo to come here  Exit John  Here Thomas drink my health  gives him money  We'll have none of our verdure wither  to day for want of moisture  Exit Thomas  Ah friend Compton had you but continued partnership with me to this day wellAy ay I stuck to Blackwellhall till I converted my wool into a golden fleece You must like a silly sheep go privateering and so be fleeced by the French and Spaniards  Compton  Why sir Felix no reflections on the part you have taken I thought it more honourable to be shorn in facing the foe than in safety to carry back a branded fleece by flying from the enemies of my country  Sir Felix  Well said my old battering ram You're a loyal subject and shall never be without his Majesty's picture while I have a collection A friend to the King should never want his countenance You're a true patriot too and it's a pity that a lover of his country should ever be in want of the blessings she produces But come give me the song that first set you agog on privateering  Compton  Sir Felix I shan't repine at my private losses so long as we can keep the dominion of the sea and preserve the Trident put into our hands by our valiant forefathers  SONG  Thus thus my boys our anchor's weigh'd  See Britain's glor√≠ous flag display'd  Unfurl the swelling fail  Sound found your shells ye Tritons sound  Let ev'ry heart with joy redound  We scud before the gale  See Neptune quit his watry car  Depos'd `by Jove's decree  To hail the freeborn British tar  The sov'reign of the sea  A fail ahead our decks we clear  Our canvass crowd the chace we near  In vain the Frenchman flies  A broadside pour'd through clouds of smoak  Our captain roars my hearts of oak  Now draw and board our prize  See Neptune c  Sir  Felix  Thank ye thank ye old partner I Od I'm so happy today  Compton  Pray sir Felix may I beg to know the cause of this happiness and these extraordinary preparations  Sir  Felix  Why Compton 'tis necessary you should know this day is a  triple  festival a little calendar man my birth day harvest home and Laura's wedding  Compton  My daughter To whom sir Felix  Sir  Felix  To my son  Compton  Eugene I'm surprised  Sir  Felix  I love to surprise people with good news You know this was always my intention  Compton  And is this all certain  Sir  Felix  True as that you have brought up my son as yours and I your daughter as an orphan that I had adopted You know they love each other and in this union of hearts my grand point is answered I am so happy my son by thinking himself not worth a shilling has escaped the foppery and ideas of dissipation he might have imbibed from a knowledge of being heir to my fortune and in your Laura I shall have a daughterinlaw possessed of sense to distinguish  it though linked to poverty and generosity to reward it with her heart  Compton  Dear sir Felix this goodness to a child of mine is a measure I  Sir  Felix  You wicked man would you oppose goodness Ha ha ha this is pleasant Laura loves Eugene though she thinks he's not worth a groat and though he doats upon her yet awed by her fortune the poor fool fighs at hnmble distance Yes and egad there were folks sighing for him too Why do you know Compton he has made a conquest of a rich cheesemonger's widow in the Borough who supposing him much poorer than herself forced money upon him to lure his affections Ha ha ha this old mouldy  vidow will have him in spite of his teeth and thinking him still incapable of repaying her in coin actually designs to hunt him with an attorney and follow him here into the country to force him into marriage Ha ha ha but where's Eugene now because the bridegroom's presence is necessary at a wedding you know  Compton  I left him at home drawing  Sir  Felix  At study how to get his bread by scratching upon copper or daubing canvass Ha ha ha  Compton  True sir Felix From the idea he has Fortune still to court he is diligent in improving every grace and acquiring every accomplishment that can render him worthy of her favour  Sir  Felix  And Laura in London laying out a few hondreds I gave her this morning  Compton  Without an idea that I am her father and even breathe but from your bounty O sir Felix to so many obligations in the scale gratitude is a feather  Sir  Felix  Then keep it to yourself you featherheaded goose Arn't we to be happy Compton you took me into partnership with you when all my stock was a little honesty a poor capital as the world goes I have now the means you the inclination And were you rich and I poor I know you'd act by me as I mean to do by you Here Lingo Lingo  Compton  I see you have brought home your new butler  Sir  Felix  Yes sir but he's a curst fellow as ignorant as dirt It seeems he has been a schoolmaster here in the country taught all the bumpkin fry what he calls Latin and the damn'd dog so patches his own bad English with his bits of bad Latin and jumbles the Gods Goddesses Heroes celestial and infernal together at such a rate I took him to oblige a foolish old friend of mine who intended him for Saint Omers so I  must keep him to draw good wine and brew balderdash LatinLingo  Compton  I see a carriage coming down the avenue  Sir  Felix  Eh it's Laura Step you home for Eugene D'ye hear Compton not a word till I break the matter myself Edod they'll be as happy  Compton  I am sure they will be perfectly so  SONG  The virgin lily of the night  Aurora finds in tears  But soon in coif of native white  Her sragrant head she rears  No longer droops distres'd forlorn  But fresh and blithe as Mar  She rises to perfume the morn  And smiles upon the day  The limpid streams of noble source  That miles in darkness flow  Emerging in their devious course  Translucen beauties shew  O'er golden sands they gently glide  Unruffled with the gale  Reflecting heaven with splendid pride  As rolling thro' the vale  Exit  Sir  Felix  I'll puzzle 'em a little first though their surprise and joy will be the greater  Enter  Laura Fringe  and  William  with band boxes c  Sir  Felix  Eh Laura welcome home my girl  Laura  I thank you sirHere Fringe take these things into the house  Fringe  Yes Madam  Exit  Sir  Felix  Here we are ehvery well Laid out all your cashWell wellDid n't run in debt I hope  Laura  No sir your kindness amply supplied me  Sir  Felix  That's right But comeyour journal  Laura

sirthe very crown of elegance  Sir  Felix  And cost a crown in silver I warrant now  Laura  A crown dear sir it's cheap of three guineas  Sir  Felix  Three guineasBondstreet They make mighty pretty caps in Cranbournalley  Laura  True sir But if we don't yield a little to the fashions of the times we shall make a rusty appearance to our polished neighbours of the Continent  Sir  Felix  Laura I like a medium I'll neither rust in particularity nor will I be a weathercock to every puff of fashion  SONG  In Jacky Bull when bound for France  The gosling you discover  Tho' taught to ride to fence and dance  A finish'd goose comes over  With his tierce and carte sa sa  And his cotillon so smart ha ha  He charms each female heart O la  As Jacky returns from Dover  For cocks and dogs see squire at home  The prince of country tonies  Return'd form Paris Spa or Rome  Our squire's a nice Adonis  With his tierce and carte c  Sir  Felix  For a trip or so I should have no objection to a snuff at the air of Fontainbleau should like to see the little chapel at Loretto or the great tun of Heidelburg or the Escurial the bull feast the goblins tapestry or no offence  to his Holiness's great toe to pop my nose into the Vatican But after all I should be unfashionable enough to prefer little England to all the gardens and fountains of France and paiaces and conversationi of Italy  Laura  I apprehend sir I should be somewhat of your opinion in that particular  SONG  The tuneful lark as soaring high  Upon its downy wings  With wonder views the vaulted sky  And mounting sweetly sings  Ambition swells its little breast  Suspended high in air  And gently dropping to its nest  Finds real pleasures there  Exit  Sir  Felix  Ha ha haPoor Laura I'll surprise you presentlyLingoWhere is

Eugene  Impute my offence to the real cause my respect to my divine Laura  Laura  Send your respect back to its fource the bounty of sir Felix  Eugene  My love you have my heart my life But when I reflect on the distance my fare has thrown me from you it checks my presumption I endeavour to hide from selfcontempt and would if possible shrink from my own opinion  Laura  What was I Eugene a poor abandoned orphan and but for the kind attention of sir Felix I should be a wretched outcast and experience the cold reception poverty must expect from a hard and sordid world  Eugene  O my love had we been born humble villagers with my Laura I should have been happy  Laura  And I too with my Engene  DUET  Eugene  The blushing sun shall never rise  To steal the woodbine's pearly dew  But thy dear
