 AN EXTRACT OF THE LIFE and DEATH OF Mr  John Janeway  Fellow of  King'sCollege  in  Cambridge  By  JAMES WHEATLEY  NORWICH  Printed by WILLIAM CHASE  An Extract of the Life and Death of Mr  John Janeway  CHAP I  An Account of him from his Childhood to the Seventeenth Year of his Age  MR  John Janeway  was born in the Year  October  of religious Parents in  Tylly  in the County of  Hertford  He soon gave his Parents the Hope of much Comfort and the Symp∣toms of something more than ordinary quickly ap∣peared in him so that some who saw this  Child  much feared that his Life would be but  short  others hoped that God had some Work to do by or for him he shewed that neither of them were mistaken in their Conjectures concerning him He soon outran his Superiours for Age in  Learning  And it was thought by no incompetent Judges that for Pregnancy of  Wit  Solidity of  Judgment  the Vastness of his  Intellectuals  and the Greatness of his  Memory  he had no  Superiours  and few  Equals  considering his Age and Education  He was initiated in the  Latin  Tongue by his  Fa∣ther  afterwards he was brought up in St  Paul  's School in  London  where he made a considerable Pro∣ficiency in  Latin  and  Greek  under the Care of Mr  Langley  When he was about eleven Years old he took a great Fancy to  Arithmetick  and the  Hebrew Tongue  About this Time his Parents removing into a little Village called  Aspoden  had the Opportunity of hav∣ing their  Son  instructed by a learned Neighbour who was pleased to count it a Diversion to read  Mathe∣maticks  to him being then about twelve Years old and he made such Progress in those Studies that he read  Oughtred  with Understanding before he was thirteen Years old A Person of Quality hearing of the admirable Proficiency of this Boy sent for him up to  London  and kept him with him for some time to read  Mathematicks  to him That which made him the more to be admired was That he did what he did with the greatest Facility He had no small Skill in Musick and other Concomitants of the Mathema∣ticks  In the Year he was chosen by Mr  Rous  the Provost of  Eaton  College one of the Foundation of that School Where he gave no unsuitable Returns to the high Expectation that was conceived of him  After a little Continuance at  Eaton  he obtained Leave of his Master to go to  Oxford  to perfect him∣self in the Study of  Mathematicks  where being with Dr  Ward  one of the Professors of the University he attained to a strange Exactness in that Study nothing being within the Reach of a  Man  but he would un∣dertake and grasp The Doctor looked upon him as one of the  Wonders of his Age  loved him dearly and could not for some time after his  Death  scarce men∣tion his Name without  Tears  When he had spent about a Quarter of a Year with Dr  Ward  at  Oxford  he was commanded to return to  Eaton  where he soon gave Proof of his Improvement of his Time while he was  absent  by calculating of the Eclipses for many Years before hand so that by this Time he had many  Eyes  upon him as the Glory of the School Yet he did not discover the least Affectation or Selfconceit neither did any discernable Pride attend these Excel∣lencies So that every one took more Notice of his  Parts  than himself  At about seventeen Years old he was chose to  King's  College  in  Cambridge  at which time the Electors did even contend for the Patronage of this  Scholar  He was chosen first that Year and an elder Brother of his in the sixth Place but he was very willing to change Places with his elder Brother letting him have the first and thankfully accepting of the sixth Place  Besides his great Learning and many other Orna∣ments of Nature his Deportment was so sweet and lovely his Demeanour so courteous and obliging many of them who had little Kindness for Morality much less for Grace could not but speak well of him His great Wisdom and Learning did even command Respect He had an excellent Power over his Passions and was in a great Measure free from the Vice which usually attends such an Age and Place  But all this while he understood little of the Worth of Christ and his own Soul he studied indeed the Heavens and knew the Motion of the Sun Moon and Stars but he thought little of God who made these Things or of his own Heart he did not as yet much busy himself in the serious Observation of the wandering of his Spirit the Creature had not yet led him to the Creator he was still too ready to take up with mere Speculation but God when he was about eighteen Years old shone in upon his Soul with Power and convinced him what a poor Thing it was to know so much of the Heavens and never come there And that the greatest Knowledge in the World without Christ was but an empty dry Business He now thought Mr  Bolton  had some Reasons on his Side when he said  Give me the most magnificent glorious Worlding that ever trod upon earthly Mould richly crowned with all the Ornaments and Excellencies of Na∣ture Art Policy Preferment or what Heart can wish besides yet without the Life of Grace to animate and enable them he were to the Eye of heavenly Wisdom but as a rotten Carcass stuck over with Flowers magnified Dung guilded Rottenness golden Damnation  He began now to be of  Anaxagoras  's Mind That his Work upon Earth was to study Heaven and get thither  and that except a Man might be admitted to greater Preferment than this World can bestow it was not worth the while to be born  CHAP II  Of his Conversion and Carriage when Fellow of the College  THE great Work of  Conversion  was not carried on upon his Soul in that dreadful Manner that it is upon some but the Lord was pleased sweetly to unlock his Heart by the exemplary Life and hea∣venly Discourse of a young Man in the College whose Heart God had enflamed with Love to his Soul he quickly made an Attempt upon this y  ung Man and the Spirit of God set home his Counsels with such Power that they proved effectual for his awakening being accompanied with the preaching of Dr  Hill  and Dr  Arrowsmith  together with the reading of Mr  Baxter  's Saint's Everlasting Rest  Now a mighty Alteration might easily be discerned in him He began not to taste so much Sweetness in those Kind of Studies which he so greedily imploy'd himself in formerly He began to pity them who were curious in their Enquiries after every thing but that which is most needful to be known  Christ  and  themselves  and that which sometimes was his Gain he now counted Loss for  Christ  yea doubtless he esteemed all Things but as Dung and Dross in Comparison of  Christ  and desired to know nothing but  Christ  and him  crucified  Not that he looked upon human Learning as useless But when fixed below Christ and not improved for Christ he looked upon Wisdom as Folly and Learning as Madness and that which would make one more like the Devil and more fit for his Service  Mr  Janeway  now considered how he might best improve what he did already know and turn all his  Studies into the right Channel Grace did not take him off from but made him more diligent and spiri∣tual in his Study And now Christ was at the End and Bottom of every thing How did he plot and contrive how he might most express his Love and Thankful∣ness to him who had brought him out of Darkness into his marvellous Light To this End he sent up and down Packets of divine Letters in which he did dis∣course so substantially and experimentally of the great Things of God that it would not at all have unbe∣come some grey Head to have owned what he wrote  He was not a little like young  Elihu  in whose Words he used to excuse his Freedom with Persons of Years whose Souls he dearly pitied He said  Days should speak and Multitude of Years should teach Wisdom but there is a Spirit in a Man and the Inspiration of the Al∣mighty giveth them Understanding I am full of Mat∣ter the Spirit within me constraineth me Behold my Belly is as Wine which hath no Vent it is ready to burst like new Bottles I will speak that I may be refreshed  O then how sweet was the Savour of his Graces He could not but speak the Things which he had seen and heard and even invite all the World to taste and see how good the Lord was  He began first with his Relations begging and wooing of them to think of their immortal Souls and to lay in speedy Provisions for a Deathbed and Eter∣nity Oh with what Compassion did he plead the Cause of Christ with their Souls What pathetick Expressions did he use what vehement Expostulations how frequent how particular in his Applications to them O with what Gravity and Majesty would he speak of the Mysteries of the Gospel  Read what his Language was when he was between  eighteen  and  nineteen  Years old in a Letter to a Friend that had the Care of many Children  SIR  YOUR Charge is great upon a temporal Account but greater upon a spiritual Out of an earnest Desire of the Good of Souls and your own Joy and Peace  I importunately request that you should have a great Care of your Children and be often dropping in some whol∣some Admonitions and this I humbly with Submission to your Judgment in it commend to you Not to admonish them always together but likewise privately one by one Wherein you may please to press upon them their natural Corruption the Necessity of Regeneration the Excellency of Christ and how unspeakably lovely it is to see young ones sitting out for Heaven This way I think may do most good having had Experience of it myself in some small Measure God grant that all may work for the edi∣fying of those who are committed to you I leave you under the Protection of him that hath loved us and given himself for us  When he was about twenty Years old he was made Fellow of the College which did not a little advance those noble Projects which he had for the promoting of the Interest of the  Lord Christ  Then how sweetly would he insinuate into the young ones desiring to carry as many of them as possible he could along with him to Heaven Many Attempts he made upon some of the same House that he might season them with Grace and animate and encourage those who were  looking towards Heaven  And as for his own Rela∣tions never was there a more compassionate and ten∣derhearted Brother How many pathetick Letters did he send to them and how did he follow them with  Prayers  and  Tears  Read what his Heart was in the following Lines  Distance of Place cannot at all lessen that natural Bond whereby we are conjoined in Blood neither ought to lessen that of Love Nay where true Love is it cannot for Love towards you I can on∣ly say this That I feel it better than I can express it But Love felt and not expressed is little worth I therefore desire to make my Love manifest in the best Way I can Let us look upon one another not as Brethren only but as Members of the same Body whereof Christ is the Head Let us therefore breath and hunger after Him so that our close Knot  may meet in Christ If we are in Christ and Christ in us then we shall be one with one another This I know you cannot complain for want of Instruc∣tion God hath not been to us a dry Wilderness you have had Line upon Line and Precept upon Precept he hath planted you by the Rivers of Water It is the Lord alone indeed who maketh fruitful but yet we are not to stand still and do nothing There is a Crown worth looking for seek therefore and that earnestly Oh seek by continual Prayer keep your Soul in a praying Frame this is a great and necessary Duty nay a high and precious Privilege If thou canst say nothing come and lay thyself in an humble Man∣ner before the Lord You may believe me for I have experienced what I say There is more Sweet∣ness in one Glimpse of God's Love than in all that the World can afford Oh do but try Oh taste and see how good the Lord is Get into a Corner and throw yourself down before the Lord and beg of God to make you sensible of your lost State by Nature and of the Excellency and Necessity of Christ Say Lord give me a broken Heart soften and melt me Any thing in the World so I may be but enabled to value Christ and be perswaded to accept of him as he is tendered in the Gospel O that I may be delivered from the Wrath to come Oh a Blessing for me even for me And resolve not to be content till the Lord have in some Mea∣sure answered you Oh my Bowels yearn towards you Oh that you did but know with what Af∣fection I write now unto you and what Prayers and Tears are mingled with these Lines The Lord set these Things home and give you an Heart to ap∣ply them to yourself the Lord bless all the Means that you enjoy for his Blessing is all in all Give me leave to deal plainly and to come yet a little close to you for I love your Soul so well that I cannot bear the Thoughts of the Loss of it Know this that except a Man be born again he cannot  enter into the Kingdom of Heaven God's Favour is not to be recovered without it This new Birth hath its Foundation laid in a Sense of Sin and a godly Sorrow for it and a Heart set against it without this there can be no Salvation Look well about you and see into yourself and thou wilt see that thou art at Hell's Mouth without this first Step and nothing but free Grace and pure Mercy is be∣tween you and the State of the Devils The Lord deliver us from a secure careless Heart Here you see a natural Man's Condition How darest thou then lie down in Security Oh look about for your Soul's Sake What shall I say what shall I do to awaken your poor Soul I say again wthout Repentance there is no Remission and Repentance itself may lose its Labour if it be not in the right Manner Tears and Groans and Prayers will not do without Christ Most when they are convinced of Sin and are under Fears of Hell reform some∣thing and thus the Wound is healed and by this Thousands fall short of Heaven For if we be not brought off from ourselves and our Righteousness as well as our Sins we are never like to be saved We must see an absolute Need of a Christ and give ourselves up to him and count all but Dung and Dross in comparison of Christ's Righteousness Look therefore for Mercy only in Christ for his Sake rely upon God's Mercy The Terms of the Gospel are Repent and Believe gracious Terms Mercy for fetching nay Mercy for desiring nay for nonothing but receiving Dost thou desire Mercy and Grace I know thou dost Even this is the Gift of God to desire hunger after Christ let Desires put you upon Endeavours the Work itself is sweet yea Repentance and Mourning itself hath more Sweetness in it than all the World's Comforts Upon Repentance and Believing comes Justification After this Sanctification by the Spirit dwelling in us By this we come to be the Children of God to be made Partaker of the Divine Nature to lead new  Lives to have a Suitableness to God It is unwor∣thy a Christian to have such a narrow Spirit as not to act for Christ with all one's Heart and Soul and Strength Be not ashamed of Christ be not afraid of the Frowns and Scoffs of the Wicked Be sure to keep a Conscience void of Offence and by no means yield to any known Sin be much in Prayer and in secret Prayer and in reading the Scriptures Therein are laid up the glorious Mysteries which are hid from many Eyes My greatest Desire is that God would work his own great Work in you I desire to see you not as formerly but that the Lord would make me an Instrument of your Soul's Good for which I grealy long  CHAP III  His great Love to Prayer  HE was mighty in Prayer and his Spirit was of∣tentimes so transported in it that he forgot the Weakness of his own Body and of other Spirits In∣deed the Acquaintance that he had with God was so sweet and his Converse with him so frequent that when he was engaged in Duty he scarce knew how to leave that which was so delightful to his Spirit His constant Course for some Years was this He prayed at least three times a Day in secret sometimes seven times twice a Day in the Family or College And he found the Sweetness of it beyond Imagination and enjoyed wonderful Communion with God He could say by Experience That the Ways of Wisdom were Ways of Pleasantness and all her Paths Peace He knew what it was to wrestle with God and he could scarce come off his Knees without his Father's Bless∣ing He was used to converse with God with a  holy Familiarity  as a  Friend  and would upon all Occasions run to him for Advice and had many strange and im∣mediate  Answers  of Prayer One of which I think it not impertinent to give an Account of  His Honoured Father Mr  William Janeway  Mi∣nister of  Kelshall  in  Hartfordshire  being sick and be∣ing under somewhat dark Apprehensions as to the State of his Soul he would often say to his Son  John  "Oh Son this passing into Eternity is a great Thing this Dying is a solemn Business and enough to make one's Heart ake that hath not his Pardon sealed and his Evidences for Heaven clear And truly Son I am under no small Fears as to my own Estate for another World Oh that God would clear his Love Oh that I could say chearfully I can die and upon good Grounds be able to look Death in the Face and ven∣ture upon Eternity with wellgrounded Peace and Comfort"  Seeing his Father continuing under Despondings of Spirit though no Christians that knew him but had a high Esteem of him for his Uprightness he got by himself and spent some time in wrestling with God upon his Account earnestly begging of God that he would fill him with Joy unspeakable in believing and that he would speedily give him some Token for Good that he might joyfully and honourably leave this World After he was risen from his Knees he came down to his Father and asked him how he felt himself His Father made no Answer for some time but wept exceedingly a Passion that he was not subject to and continued for some considerable time weeping so that he was not able to speak But at last having recovered himself with unspeakably Joy he burst out "Oh Son now it is come it is come it is come I bless God I can die the Spirit of God hath wit∣nessed with my Spirit that I am his Child Now I can look up to God as my dear Father and Christ as my Redeemer I can now say this is my Friend and this is my Beloved My Heart is full it is brim full I can hold no more I know now what that Sentence means The Peace of God which passeth all Under∣standing I know now what that white Stone is where∣in a new Name was written which none know but they who have it And that Fit of Weeping which  you saw in me was a Fit of overpowered Love and Joy so great that I could not contain myself Neither can I express what glorious Discoveries God had made of himself unto me And had that Joy been greater I question whether I could have born it and whether it would not have separated Soul and Body Bless the Lord O my Soul and all that is within me bless his holy Name that hath pardoned all my Sins and seal∣ed the Pardon He hath healed my Wounds and caused the Bones which he had broken to rejoice Oh help me to bless the Lord he hath put a new Song into my Mouth Oh bless the Lord for his infinite Goodness Oh now I can die It is nothing I bless God I can die I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ" You may well think that his Son's Heart was not a little refresh'd to hear such Words and see such a Sight and to meet the Messenger that he had sent to Heaven returned back again so speedily It was so immediate and clear an Answer of his own Prayers as if God had said unto him Thy Tears and Prayers are heard for thy Father Thou hast like a Prince prevailed with God thou hast God the Blessing Go down and see  Upon this the young Man too broke forth into Praises and even into an Extasy of Joy that God should deal so familiarly with him and the Father and Son together were so full of Joy Light Life Love and Praise that there was a little Heaven in the Place He could not then but express himself in this Manner "Oh blessed for ever blessed be God for his infinite Grace Oh who would not pray unto God Verily he is a God that heareth Prayers and that my Soul knows right well" And then he told his joyful Father how much he was affected with his former Despondings and what he had been praying for just before with all the Earnestness he could His Father hearing this and perceiving that his former Comforts came by Prayer and his own Child's Prayer too was the more refreshed and the more confirmed that it was from the Spirit of God and no Delusion And  immediately his Son standing by he fell into another Fit of triumphing Joy his weak Body being almost ready to sink under that great Weight of Glory that shone in so powerfully upon his Soul He could then say "Now let thy Servant depart in Peace for my Eyes have seen thy Salvation" He could now walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and fear no Evil Oh how sweet a thing is it to have one's In∣terest in Christ cleared how comfortable to have our Calling and Election made sure How lovely is the Sight of a smiling Jesus when one is dying how re∣freshing is it when Heart and Flesh and all are failing to have God for the Strength of our Heart and our Portion for ever Oh did the foolish unexperienced World but know what these Things mean did they but understand what it is to have their Senses spiritual∣ly exercised could they but taste and see how good the Lord is it would soon cause them to disrelish their low and brutish Pleasures and look upon all worldly Joys as infinitely short of one  Glimpse of God's Love  After this his  Father  had a sweet Calm upon his Spirits and went in the Strength of that Provision 'till he came within the Gates of the  New Jerusalem  Having all his Graces greatly improved and shewed so much Humility Love of God Contempt of the World such prizing of Christ such Patience as few Christians ar∣rive to especially his Faith by which with extraordi∣nary Confidence he cast his  Widow  and  eleven fatherless Children  upon the Care of that God who had fed him with this  Manna  in his  Wildernessstate  The Benefit of which  Faith  all his Children none of which were in his Lifetime provided for have since experienced And it is scarce to be imagined how helpful this his Son was to his Father by his heavenly Discourse hum∣ble Advice and Prayers After four Months Conflict with a Consumption he sweetly slept in Jesus  After the Death of his Father he did what he could to supply his Absence doing the Part of a Husband Son and Brother So that he was no small Comfort to his poor Mother in her disconsolate State and all  the rest of his Relations that had any Sense of God upon their Spirits To one of which he thus addres∣seth himself upon the Death of a sweet Child  He that in Afflictions would find Comfort must strive to see spiritual Comforts to be the greatest even that Comfort which is from God in the Face of Je∣sus Christ this this will be a Cordial this will be as Marrow and Fatness to the Soul They who have an Interest in Christ what need they be moved with any worldly Trouble Is not Christ better than ten Children Is not his loving Kindness better than Life Is not all the World a Shadow compared with one Hour's Enjoyment of him even on this Side of Glory O therefore strive to get your Interest in this Comfort secured and then all's well He that hath Christ hath all things If God be reconciled to you through him then he will withhold no good Thing from you  We poor foolish Creatures do scarce know what is good for ourselves but it's no small Encourage∣ment to the People of God that Wisdom itself takes Care of them and one who loves them better than they love themselves  looks after them and he hath given his Promise for it  that all shall work together for their Good And what better Foundation of Com∣fort can there be in the whole World than this  Let this serve as a Remedy against excessive Grief Get your Love to God increased which if you do the Love of all other Things will wax cold And if you have given God your Heart you will give him Leave to take what he will that is yours and what he hath you will judge rather well kept than lost  Remember that Scripture and let it have its due Im∣pression upon your Spirit  He that loves Father or Mo∣ther Brother or Sister yea or Children more than me is not worthy of me  O labour to have your Affections therefore more raised up to him who is most worthy of them let him have the uppermost Room in your Heart and let your Love to all other Things be placed in Subjection to your Love of God be ruled by it and directed to it  CHAP IV  His Return to King'sCollege after his Father's Death and his Temptations from Satan  WHEN his Father was dead he returned again to  King'sCollege  and was a Member of a se∣cret Society which began to plot how they might best improve their Gifts and Graces so as to be serviceable to God and their Generations Their Custom was frequently to meet together to pray and to communi∣cate  Studies  and  Experiences  Some of this Company did degenerate but others lived to let the World un∣derstand that what they did was from a  vital Princi∣ple  Amongst whom this young Man was none of the  least  One of their Designs was to engage the  Juni∣ors  if possible before they were ensnared by wicked Company when they came fresh from  School  After some time most of his dear Companions were  trans∣planted  either into Gentlemens Families or Livings and Mr  Janeway  being one of the youngest was for a while left alone in the  College  But he wanting the comfortable Diversion of suitable Society fixed so intensely upon his Studies that he soon gave such a Wound to his bodily Constitution as could never be throughly healed  Thus you have a Taste of his Spirit and may per∣ceive what it was that he had his Heart set upon what kept his Graces in such Vigour and Activity and how desirous he was that others should be Sharers with him in this Mercy Yet for all this he had his gloomy Days and the Sun was sometimes overcast his Sweets were sometimes imbittered with dreadful and horrid Temptations The Devil shot his poi∣sonous Arrows at him yet through the Captain of his Salvation he came more than a Conqueror out of the Field He was with  Paul  many times  lifted up into the third Heavens and saw and heard Things unutterable  But lest he should be exalted above Measure there was a Messenger of Satan sent to buffet him  It would make a Christian's Heart even ake to hear what strange Temptations he was exercised with But he was well armed for such a Conflict having on the Shield of Faith whereby he quenched the fiery Darts of that wicked One Yet this Fight cost him the Sweating of his very Body for Agonies of Spirit and Tears and strong Cries to Heaven for fresh Help▪ As for himself he was wont to take an Arrow out of God's Quiver and discharge it by Faith and Prayer for the Discomfiture of his violent Enemy who at last was fain to fly  These Temptations and Conflicts with Satan did not a little help him in his Dealing with one that was sorely afflicted with the like Temptations And be∣cause I judge it may be of Use to such I insert a Let∣ter of his to one in the like Case  Dear Friend  YOU say that you are troubled with blasphe∣mous Thoughts So then though they are blasphemous yet they are your Trouble and nei∣ther sent for nor welcome and so are not assented to in your Mind What then shall we think of them If they were your own Production your Heart would be delighted in its own Issue but you do nothing less Sure then they are the Injections of that wicked one who is the Accuser of the Brethren and the Disturber of the Peace of the People of God But doth Satan use to employ those Weapons but against those that he is in fear of losing He is not wont to assault and fight against his surest Friends in this Manner Those that he hath fast in his own Pos∣session he leads on as softly and quietly as he can fearing lest such Disturbance should make them look about them and so they should awake and see their Danger But as for those that have in some Measure escaped his Snares he follows them hard with all the Discouragements he can These Things  are no other but a bitter Relish of those Things which you know to be bitter after that you have tasted how good the Lord is What then shall I call these Motions of your Mind They are the Soul's Loathing of the Morsels which Satan would have it to swallow down But you will say If these horri∣ble Thoughts be not your Sin yet they are your Mi∣sery and you desire to be freed from them And you will ask How shall I get free from them  First  See that you possess your Soul in Patience And know this that God hath an overruling Hand in all this And wait upon him for he can and will bring forth Good out of all this Evil At present you see no Light Yet  Trust in the Lord and stay yourself upon your God  Can Christ forget the Purchase of his own Blood  Can a Mother forget her suckling Child  Yet  God cannot forget his  God hath gracious Intents in all this and his Bowels yearn towards you Yea our Saviour suffers with us through his ardent Love by Sympathy as well as he hath suffered for us And you know he hath all Power in his Hand who doth imploy this Power in a Way of Love towards his This Power is made yours through the Prayer of Faith But for your own Work do this  First  Let not such Thoughts have any Time of A∣bode in your Mind but turn them out with all the Abhorrence you can but not with so much Trouble and Disturbance of Mind as I believe you do For by this the Devil is pleased and makes you your own Tormentor  Secondly  Always divert your Thoughts to some good Thing and let those very Injections be con∣stantly the Occasion of your more spiritual Medita∣tion Think the quite contrary or fall a praying with Earnestness and the Devil will be weary if he find his Designs thus broken and that those Sparks of Hell which he struck into the Soul to kindle and inflame Corruption do put Warmth into Grace and set Faith and Prayer a Working Thus resist him and he will flee from you  Thirdly  Consider that this is no new Thing For we are not in this ignorant of Satan's Devises that if any Soul hath escaped out of the Chains of Dark∣ness if he will have Heaven he shall have it with as much Trouble as the Devil can lay on and if he and his had their Wills no good Man should have one peaceable Hour But Blessed be God the Devil cannot pluck us out of those Almighty Arms with which he doth embrace his dear Children  Yours in our dear Lord  John Janeway  His Love to Christ and Souls made him very de∣sirous  to spend and be spent in the Work of the Ministry  accordingly he did comply with the first loud and clear Call to preach the everlasting Gospel and tho' he was but two and twenty Years old yet he came to that Work like one that understood what Kind of Em∣ployment Preaching was He was a Workman that needed not to be ashamed that was throughly fur∣nished for every good Word and Work one that was able to answer Gainsayers one in whom the  Word of God dwelt richly  one full of the Spirit and Power one that hated Sin with a perfect Hatred and loved Holiness with all his Soul in whom Religion in its Beauty did shine one that knew  the Terrors of the Lord  and knew how to beseech Sinners  in Christ's Stead to be reconciled unto God  One that was  a Son of Thunder  and  a Son of Consolation  In a Word I may speak that of him which  Paul  speaks of  Timothy  that  I knew none like minded that did naturally care for Souls  And had he lived to have preached often Oh what Use might such a Man have been of in his Ge∣neration One in whom Learning and Holiness did as it were strive which should excell He never preach∣ed publickly but twice and then he came to it as if he had been used to that Work forty Years deliver∣ing the Word of God with that Power and Majesty  with that Tenderness and Compassion with what Rea∣diness and Freedom that it made his Hearers amazed He was lead into the Mystery of the Gospel and he spoke nothing to others but what was the Language of his Heart and the Fruit of great Experience and which one might easily perceive had no small Im∣pression first upon his own Spirits  His  first  and  last  Sermons were upon Communion and intimate Converse with God out of  Job  xxii A Subject that few Christians under Heaven were better able to manage than himself and that scarce any could handle so feelingly as he For he did for some considerable time maintain such an intimate Familiarity with God that he seemed to converse with Him as one Friend doth converse with another This Text he made some Entrance into whilst he was here But the perfecting of his Acquaintance with God was a Work fitter for another World  He was one that kept an exact Watch over his Thoughts Words and Actions and made a Review of all that passed him at least once a Day in a solemn Manner He kept a  Diary  in which he did write down every Evening what the Frame of his Spirit had been all the Day long especially in every Duty He took Notice what Profit he received in his spiritual Traffick what Returns from that far Country what Answers of Prayer what Deadness and Flatness and what observable Providences did present themselves and the Substance of what he had been doing and any Wandrings of Thoughts Inordinancy in any Passion which though the World could not discern he could It cannot be conceived by them which do not practise the same to what a good Account this turn'd This made him retain a grateful Remembrance of Mercy and live in a constant adoring of Divine Goodness this brought him to a very intimate Ac∣quaintance with his own Heart this kept his Spirit low and fitted him for free Communications with God this made him more lively and active this helped him to walk humbly with God this made him  speak more affectionately and experimentally to others of the Things of God And in a Word this left a sweet Calm upon his Spirits because he every Night made even his Accounts and if his Sheets should prove his Windingsheet it had been all one for he could say his Work was done so that Death could not surprize him  CHAP V  An Account of the latter Part of his Life  FOR the latter Part of his Life he lived like a Man that was quite weary of the World and that looked upon himself as a Stranger here and liv∣ed in the constant Sight of a better He plainly declared himself but a Pilgrim that looked for a bet∣ter Country a City that had Foundations whose Builder and Maker was God His Habit his Lan∣guage his Deportment all spoke him one of another World His Meditations were so intense long and frequent that they ripened him apace for Heaven but somewhat weakened his Body Few Christians attain to such a holy Contempt of the World and to such clear joyful constant Apprehensions of the transcen∣dent Glories of the unseen World  He made it his whole Business to keep up sensible Communion with God and to grow into an humble Familiarity with God and to maintain it And if by reason of Company or any necessary Business this was in any Measure interrupted he would complain like one out of his Element till his Spirit was recover∣ed into a delightful unmixed free Intercourse with God He was never so well satisfied as when he was more immediately engaged in what brought him nearer to God and by this he constantly enjoyed those Comforts which others rarely meet with His Graces and Experiences toward his End grew to Astonishment His Faith got up to a full Assurance his Desires into  a kind of Enjoyment He was oft brought into the Banquettinghouse and there Christ's Banner over him was Love and he sate down under his Shadow with great Delight and his Fruit was pleasant unto his Taste His Eyes beheld the King in his Beauty and while he sate at his Table his Spikenard did send forth its pleasant Smell He had frequent Visions of Glory lay in the Bosom of his Master and was sure∣ly a very beloved Disciple and highly favoured His Lord oft call'd him up to the Mount to him and let him see his excellent Glory O the sweet Foretaste that he had of those Pleasures that are at the right Hand of God How oft was he feasted with the Feast of fat Things those Wines on the Lees well refined and sometimes he was like a Giant refresh'd with new Wine rejoicing to run the Race that was set before him whether of doing or of suffering He was even sick of Love and he could say to the poor unexperi∣enced World  O taste and see  and to Christians  Come and I will tell you what God hath done for my Soul  O what do Christians mean that they do no more to get their Senses spiritually exercised O why do they not make Religion the very Business of their Lives O why is the Soul Christ and Glory thus despised Is there nothing in Communion with God Are all those Comforts of Christians that follow hard after him worth Nothing Is it not worth the while to make one's Calling and Election sure O why do Men and Women jest and dally in the great Matter of E∣ternity Little do People think what they slight when they are seldom and formal in secret Duties and when they neglect the great Duty of  Meditation  which I have through rich Mercy found so sweet and refreshing O what do Christians mean that they keep at such a Distance from a Christ Did they but know the thousandth Part of that Sweetness which is in him they could not choose but follow him hard they would run and not be weary and walk and not be faint  He could sensibly and experimentally commend the  Ways of God to the poor unexperienced World and say  his Ways are Pleasantness  and justify Wisdom and say  her Paths were Peace  He could take off those Aspersions which the Devil and the World cast upon Godliness in the Power of it Here is one that could challenge all the Atheists in the World to dis∣pute here is one that could bring sensible Demon∣strations to prove a Deity and the Reality and Ex∣cellencies of Invisibles which these Fools and Mad∣men make the Subject of their Scorn Here is one that would not change Delights with the greatest E∣picures living and vie Pleasure with all the Sensua∣lists of the World Which of them all could in the Midst of their Jollity say  This is the Pleasure that shall last for ever  Which of them can say among their Cups  I can now look Death in the Face  and  this very Moment I can be content  yea glad  to leave these Delights as knowing I shall enjoy better  And this he could do when he fared deliciously in spiritual Ban∣quets every Day He could upon better Reason than he did say  Soul thou hast Goods laid up for many Years  He knew full well that what he did here en∣joy was but a little to what he should have shortly  In his Presence there is Fulness of Joy at his right Hand there are Pleasures for evermore  Where is the  Bel∣shazzar  that would not quake in the midst of his Cups whilst he is quaffing the richest Wine if he should see a Hand upon the Wall writing bitter things against him telling him that this Night his Soul must be required of him that now he must come away and give an Account of all his ungodly Pleasures be∣fore the mighty God Where is the Sinner that could be contented to hear the Lord roaring out of  Zion  whilst he is roaring in the Tavern Which of them would be glad to hear the Trumpet sound and to hear that Voice  Arise ye Dead and come to Judgment  Which of them would rejoice to see the Mountains quake the Elements melting with fervent Heat and the Earth consumed with Flames and the Lord Christ whom they despised coming in the Clouds with Millions of  his Saints and Angels to be avenged upon those that knew not God and obeyed not his Gospel Is not that a blessed State when a Man can lift up his Head with Joy when others tremble with Fear and sink with Sorrow And this was the Condition of this holy young Man In the midst of all worldly Com∣forts he longed for Death and the Thoughts of the Day of Judgment made all his Enjoyments sweeter O how did he long for the Coming of Christ Whilst some have been discoursing by him of that great and terrible Day of the Lord he would smile and hum∣bly express his Delight in the Forethought of that approaching Hour  I remember once there was a great Talk that one had foretold the  Doomsday  should be upon such a Day Although he blamed their daring Folly that would pretend to know that which was hid from the Angels themselves yet granting their Suspicion to be true what then said he What if the Day of Judg∣ment were come as it will most cerrainly come short∣ly If I were sure the Day of Judgment were to be∣gin within an Hour I should be glad with all my Heart If at this very instant I should hear such Thunderings and see such Lightnings as  Israel  did at Mount  Sinai  I am persuaded my very Heart would leap for Joy Through infinite Mercy the very Me∣ditation of that Day hath even ravished my Soul and the Thought of the Certainty and Nearness of it is more refreshing to me than the Comforts of the whole World Surely nothing can more revive my Spirits than to behold the blessed Jesus the Joy Life and Beauty of my Soul Would it not more rejoice me than  Joseph  's Waggons did old  Jacob  I lately dreamed that the Day of Judgment was come Me∣thought I heard terrible Cracks of Thunder and saw dreadful Lightnings the Foundations of the Earth did shake and the Heavens were rolled together as a Garment yea all Things visible were in a Flame methought I saw the Graves opened and the Earth and Sea giving up their Dead methought I saw Mil∣lions  of Angels and Christ coming in the Clouds Methought I beheld the Ancient of Days sitting upon his Throne and all other Thrones cast down Me∣thought I beheld him whose Garments were white as Snow and the Hair of his Head like pure Wool His Throne was like the fiery Flame and his Wheels as burning Fire a fiery Stream issued and came forth from him thousands of ten thousands ministred unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood be∣fore him and the Judgment was set and the Books were opened O with what an Extasy of Joy was I surprized Methought it was the most heartraising Sight that ever my Eyes beheld And then I cried out  I have waited for thy Salvation O God  and so I mounted into the Air to meet my Lord in the Clouds  This I record only to shew how far he was from being daunted at the Thoughts of Death or Judg∣ment And to let other Christians know what is at∣tainable in this Life and what Folly it is for us to take up with so little when our Lord is pleased to make such noble Provisions for us and by wise and diligent Improvement of those Means which God hath offered us we may have an Entrance administred to us abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ  Oh how comfortable how honourable and how profitable is this State These are your Men that quit themselves like Christians This is true Gallantry noble Manhood real Valour This was the Condi∣tion of Mr  Janeway  for about three Years before he died I will not deny but that he had some Clouds but he usually walked in a sweet even humble Sere∣nity of Spirit and though he daily questioned many Actions yet did he not question his State but had his Heart fixed upon that Rock that neither Waves nor Winds could shake His Senses were still so spiritu∣ally exercised as that he could look up to Heaven as his Country and Inheritance and to God as his Father and to Christ as his Redeemer and that which is scarce to be heard of he counted it the high∣est  Act of Patience to be willing to live and a very great Selfdenial to be contented to be in this World and to dwell in this Side a full and eternal Enjoyment of that royal glorious One whom his Soul was so much in love with  CHAP VI  His last Sickness and Death  HIS Body is now shaken again and he falls into a deep Consumption but this Messenger of God did not in the least damp him Spitting of Blood was no ghastly thing to one that had his Eye upon the Blood of Jesus faint Sweats did not daunt him that had always such revival Cordials at hand It's mat∣ter of Joy to him that he was now in some Hopes of having his earnest Desires satisfied  After he had been a while sick a sudden Dimness seized upon his Eyes By and by his Sight quite failed and there was such a visible Alteration in him that he and others judged these things to be the Symptoms of Death approaching But when he was thus taken he was not in the least surprized but was lifted up with Joy to think what a Life he was going to looking upon Death itself as one of his Father's Servants and his Friends that was sent as a Messen∣ger to conduct him safely to his glorious Palace  When he felt his Body ready to faint he called to his Mother and said  Dear Mother I am dying but I beseech you be not troubled for I am through Mercy quite above the Fears of Death It's no great Matter I have nothing troubles me but the Apprehensions of your Grief I am going to him whom I love above Life  But it pleased the Lord to raise him again a little out of his fainting Fit for his Master had yet more Work for him to do before he must receive his Wages Although his outward Man decayed apace yet he is  renew'd in the inward Man Day by Day His Graces were never more active and his Experiences never greater When one would have thought he should have been taken up with his Distemper and that it had been enough for him to grapple with his Pains he quite forgets his Weakness and is so swallowed up of the Life to come that he had scarce Leisure to think of his Sickness  For several Weeks together I never heard the least Word that favoured with any Complaint or Weariness under the Hand of God except his eager Desire to be with Christ be counted Complaining and his Haste to be in Heaven Impatience Now was the time when one might have seen Heaven and the Glory of another World realized to Sense His Faith grew exceeding∣ly and his Life was proportionable and his Joys were equal to both  O the rare Attainments The high and divine Ex∣pressions that dropped from his Mouth I have not Words to express what a strange triumphant angelical Frame he was in for some considerable Time toge∣ther It was a very Heaven upon Earth to hear and see a Man admiring God at such a rate Those that did not see cannot well conceive what a sweet Frame he was in for at least six Weeks before he died His Soul was almost always filled with those Joys unspeak∣able and full of Glory How oft would he cry out  Oh that I could let you know what I now feel Oh that I could shew you what I see Oh that I could express the thousandth Part of that Sweetness that I now find in Christ You would all think it then well worth the while to make it your Business to be religious  Oh my dear Friends we little think what Christ is worth upon a Deathbed I would not for a World nay for Milli∣ons of Worlds be now without Christ and a Pardon I would not for a World be to live any longer The very Thoughts of a Possibility of Recovery makes me tremble  When one came to visit him and told him that he hoped it might please God to raise him again and  that he had seen many a weaker Man restored to Health and that lived many a good Year after  And do you think to please me  said he  by such Discourse as this  No Friend you are much mistaken in me if you think that the Thoughts of Life and Health and the World are pleasing to me The World hath quite lost its Excellency in my Judgment O how poor and contemptible a thing it is in all its Glory compared with the Glory of that invisible World which I now live in the Sight of And as for Life Christ is my Life Health and Strength and I know I shall have another kind of Life when I leave this I tell you it would incomparably more please me if you should say to me You are no Man of this World you cannot possibly hold out long before Tomorrow you will be in Eternity I tell you I do so long to be with Christ that I could be contented to be cut in Pie∣ces and to be put to the most exquisite Torments so I might but die and be with Christ Oh how sweet is Jesus  Come Lord Jesus come quickly  Death do thy worst Death hath lost its terribleness Death it is nothing I say Death is nothing through Grace to me I can as easily die as shut my Eyes to turn my Head and sleep  I long to be with Christ I long to die  His Mother and Brethren standing by him he said  Dear Mother  I beseech you earnestly as ever I desir∣ed any thing of you in my Life that you would chear∣fully give me up to Christ do not hinder me now I am going to Rest and Glory I am afraid of your Prayers lest they pull one way and mine another  And then turning to his Brethren he speak thus to them  I charge you all do not pray for my Life any more you do me wrong if you do Oh that Glo∣ry the unspeakable Glory that I behold My Heart is full my Heart is full Christ smiles and I cannot chuse but smile Can you find in your Heart to stop me who am now going to the compleat and eternal Enjoyment of Christ Would you keep me from my Crown The Arms of my blessed Saviour are open to embrace me the Angels stand ready to  carry my Soul into his Bosom Oh did you but see what I see you would all cry out with me how long dear Lord come Lord Jesus come quickly  Oh why are his Chariotwheels so long a coming  And all this while he lay like a triumphing Con∣queror smiling and rejoicing in Spirit  There was never a Day towards his End but as weak as he was he did some special Piece of Service for his great Master Yea almost every Hour did produce fresh Wonders  A judicious and holy Minister came often to visit him and discoursed with him of the Excellency of Christ and the Glory of the invisible World  Sir  said he  I feel something of it my Heart is as full as it can hold in this lower State I can hold no more here Oh that I could let you know what I feel  This holy Minister praying with him his Soul was ravished with the abundant Incomes of Light Life and Love so that he could scarce bear it nor the Thoughts of staying any longer in the World but longed to be in such a Condition wherein he should have yet more Grace and more Comfort and be better able to bear that Weight of Glory some Ma∣nifestations whereof did even almost sink his we  k Body and had he not been sustained by a great Power his very Joys would have overwhelmed him and whilst he was in these Extasies of Joy and Love he was wont to cry out  'Who am I Lord who am I that thou shouldst be mindful of me Why me Lord why me Oh what shall I say unto thee O thou Preserver of Men O why me Lord why me If thou wilt look up∣on such a poor Worm who can hinder Who would not love thee Oh blessed Father Oh how sweet and gracious hast thou been unto me'  And thus he went on admiring and adoring of God in a more high and heavenly Manner than I can cloath with Words Suppose what you can on this side Heaven and I am persuaded you might have seen it in him He was wonderfully taken with the  Goodness of God to him in sending that aged expe∣rienced Minister to help him in his last great Work upon Earth  Who am I  said he  that God should send to me a Messenger one among a Thousand  Though he was towards his End most commonly in a triumphant joyful Frame yet sometimes even then he had some small Intermissions in which he would cry out  Hold out Faith and Patience yet a lit∣tle while and your Work is done  And when he found not his Heart wound up to the highest Pitch of Thank∣fulness Admiration and Love he would with great Sorrow bemoan himself and cry out in this Lan∣guage  And what's the Matter now Oh my Soul what wilt thou canst thou thus unworthily slight this ad∣mirable and astonishing Condescension of God to thee Seems it a small Matter that the great  Jeho∣vah  should deal thus familiarly with this Worm and wilt thou pass this over as a common Mercy What meanest thou Oh my Soul that thou dost not constantly adore and praise this rare strong and unspeakable Love Is it true Oh my Soul Doth God deal familiarly with Man And are his humble zealous and constant Love Praise and Service too good for God Why are not thou Oh my Soul swallowed up every Moment with this free unparallel'd everlasting Love  And then he breaks out again into another trium∣phant Extasy of Praise and Joy and expressed a lit∣tle of that which was unexpressibly in some such Words as these  Stand astonished ye Heavens and wonder O ye Angels at this infinite Grace Was ever any under Heaven more beholding to free Grace than I Doth God use to do thus with his Creatures Ad∣mire him for ever and ever Oh ye redeemed ones Oh those Joys the Taste of which I have The everlasting Joys which are at his right Hand for evermore Eternity Eternity itself is too short to praise this God in O bless the Lord with me  come let us short for Joy and boast in the God of our Salvation Oh help me to praise the Lord for his Mercy endureth for ever  One of his Brethren that had formerly been wrought upon by his holy Exhortations and Example praying with him and seeing of him as he apprehended near his Dissolution desired that the Lord would be pleased to continue those astonishing Comforts to the last Mo∣ments of his Breath and that he might go from one Heaven to another from Grace and Joy imperfect to perfect Grace and Glory and when his Work was done here give him if it were his Will the most easy and triumphant Passage to Rest  At the End of the Duty he burst out into a won∣derful Passion of Joy Sure that was Joy unspeaka∣ble and full of Glory Oh what an  Amen  did he speak  Amen Amen Amen Hallelujah  It would have made any Christian's Heart to leap to have seen and heard what some saw and heard at that time and I question not but that it would some∣what affect them to hear and read it though it be scarce possible to speak the half of what was admirable in him For it being so much beyond Precedent it did even astonish and amaze those of us that were a∣bout him that our Relation must fall hugely short of what was real  I verily believe that it exceeds the highest Rhetorick to set out to the Life what this heavenly Creature did then deliver I want Words to speak and so did he for he saw Things unutterable But yet so much he speak as justly drew the Admiration of all that saw him He talked as if he had been in the third Hea∣ven and broke out in such Words as these  Oh He is come He is come Oh how sweet How glorious is the blessed Jesus How shall I do to speak the thousandth Part of his Praises Oh for Words to set out a little of that Excellency But it is un∣expressible Oh how excellent glorious and lovely is the precious Jesus He is sweet he is altogether lovely And now I am sick of Love he hath ra∣vished  my Soul with his Beauty I shall die sick of Love  Oh my Friends stand by and wonder come look upon a dying Man and wonder I cannot myself but stand and wonder Was there ever a greater Kindness was there ever sensibler Manifestations of rich Grace Oh why me Lord why me Sure this is akin to Heaven and if I were never to enjoy any more than this it were well worth all the Torments that Men and Devils could invent to come through even a Hell to such transcendent Joys as these If this be dying dying is sweet Let no true Christians ever be afraid of dying Oh Death is sweet to me This Bed is soft Christ's Arms and Kisses his Smiles and Visits sure they would turn Hell into Heaven Oh that you did but see and feel what I do Come and behold a dying Man more chearful than ever you  w any healthful Man in the Midst of his sweetest Enjoyments Oh Sirs worldly Plea∣sures are pitiful poor sorry Things compared with one Glimpse of this Glory which shines so strongly into my Soul Oh why should any of you be so sad when I am so glad This this is the Hour that I have waited for  About eight and forty Hours before his Death his Eyes were dim and his Sight much failed his Jaws shook and trembled and his Feet were cold and all the Symptoms of Death were upon him and his ex∣tream Parts were already almost dead and senseless and yet even then his Joys were if possible greater  ▪ He had so many Fits of Joy unspeakable that he seem'd to be in one continued Act of Seraphick Love and Praise He speak like one that was just entering into the Gates of the  New Jerusalem  The greatest Part of him was now in Heaven not a Word dropt from his Mouth but it breathed Christ and Heaven Oh what Encouragement did he give to them which did stand by to follow Christ in an humble believing zealous Course of Life adding one Degree of Grace to another and using all Dili∣gence  to make their Calling and Election sure and that then they also should find a glorious Passage into a blessed Eternity  But most of his Work was  Praise  an hundred Times admiring of the bottomless Love of God to him Oh why me Lord why me And then he would give Instructions to them that came to see him He was scarce ever silent because the Love of Christ and Souls did constrain him There was so much Work done for Christ in his last Hours that I am rea∣dy to think he did as much in an Hour as some do in a Year  Every particular Person had a faithful affectionate Warning And that good Minister that was so much with him used this as an Argument to perswade him to be willing to live a little longer and to be patient to tarry God's Leisure sure God have something for thee to do that is yet undone some Word of Exhortation to some poor Soul that you have forgot  The Truth of it is he was filled with the Love of Christ that he could scarce bear Absence from him a Moment He knew that he should be capable of bearing greater Glory above than he could here It was the Judgment of some that were with him that his Heart was not only habitually but actually set on God all the Day long and nothing of human Frailty appear'd except it were his passionate Desire to die and difficult to bring himself to be willing to stay be∣low Heaven  He was wont every Evening to take his Leave of his Friends hoping not to see them till the Morning of the Resurrection and he desired that they would make sure of a comfortable Meeting at our Father's House in that other World  One Passage I cannot omit which was this That when Ministers or Christians came to him he would beg of them to spend all the Time that they had with him in Praise  O help me to praise God I have now nothing else to do from this Time to Eternity but to praise and love God I have what my Soul  desires upon Earth I cannot tell what to pray for but what I have graciously given  The Wants that are capable of supplying in this World are supplied I want but one Thing and that is  A speedy Lift to Heaven  I expect no more here I can't desire more I can't hear more Oh praise praise praise that infi∣nite boundless Love that hath to a Wonder looked upon my Soul  Help me O my Friends to praise and admire him that hath done such astonishing Wonders for my Soul he hath pardoned all my Sins he hath filled me with his Goodness he hath given me Grace and Glory and no good Thing hath he withheld from me  Come help me with Praises all's too little Come help me Oh ye glorious and mighty Angels who are so well skill'd in this heavenly Work of Praise Praise him all ye Creatures upon the Earth let every thing that hath Being help me to praise him Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Praise is now my Work and I shall be engaged in that sweet Employment for ever Bring the Bible turn to  David's Psalms  and let us sing a  Psalm  of Praise Come let's lift up our Voice in the Praise of the most High I will sing with you as long as my Breath doth last and when I have none I shall do it better  And then turning to some of his Friends that were weeping he desired them rather to rejoice than weep upon his Account It may justly seem a Wonder how he could speak so much as he did when he was so weak but the Joy of the Lord did strengthen him  In his Sickness the Scriptures that he took much Delight in were the fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth of  John  The fifty fourth of  Isaiah  was very refreshing also to him he would repeat that Word  with everlasting Mercies will I gather  with A∣bundance of Joy  He commended the Study of the Promises to Be∣lievers and desired that they would be sure to make good their Claim to them and then they might come to the Wells of Consolation and drink thereof their Fill  According to his Desire most of the Time that was spent with him was spent in Praise and he would still be calling out  More Praise still  O help me to praise him I have now nothing else to do I have done with Prayer and all other Ordinances I have almost done conversing with Mortals I shall presently be beholding Christ himself that died for me and loved me and washed me in his Blood  I shall before a few Hours are over be in Eter∣nity singing the Song of  Moses  and the Song of the  Lamb  I shall presently stand upon  Mount Zion  with an innumerable Company of Angels and the Spirits of the Just made perfect and Jesus the Me∣diator of the New Covenant I shall hear the Voice of much People and be one amongst them which shall say Hallelujah Salvation Glory Ho∣nour and Power unto the Lord our God and a∣gain we shall say Hallelujah And yet a very little while and I shall sing unto the  Lamb  a Song of Praise saying Worthy art thou to receive Praise who wert slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood out of every Kindred and Tongue and People and Nation and hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign with thee for ever and ever  Methinks I stand as it were with one Foot in Heaven and the other upon Earth methinks I hear the Melody of Heaven and by Faith I see the An∣gels waiting to carry my Soul to the Bosom of Jesus and I shall be for ever with the Lord in Glory And who can choose but rejoice in all this  Several times he speak in this Language and re∣peated many of these Words often over and over again with far greater Affection than can be well worded And I solemnly profess that what is here written is no Hyperbole and that the twentieth Part of what was observable in him is not recorded we cannot word it exactly as he did yet you have the Substance and many Things in his own Words with little or no Variation  The Day before his Death he looked somewhat earnestly upon his Brother  James  who stood by him very sad of whom he judged that he was putting up some Ejaculations to God upon his Account  I thank thee dear Brother for thy Love  said he  thou art now praying for me and I know thou lovest me dearly But Christ loveth me ten thousand times more than thou dost Come and kiss me dear Brother before I die  And so with his cold dying Lips he kissed him and said  I shall go before and I hope thou shalt follow after to Glory  Though he was almost always praising God and exhorting them that were about him to mind their ever∣lasting Concerns and secure an Interest in Christ and though he slept but very little for some Nights yet he was not in the least impaired in his Intellectuals but his Actions were all decent and becoming a Man and his Discourse to a spiritual Understanding highly rational solid divine And so he continued to the last Minute of his Breath  A few Hours before his Death he called all his Relations and Brethren together that he might give them one solemn Warning more and bless them and pray for them as his Breath and Strength would give him Leave Which he did with abundance of Au∣thority Affection and Spirituallity Which take briefly as it follows  First  He thanked his dear Mother for her tender Love to him and desired that she might be in Travel to see Christ formed in the Souls of the rest of her Children and see of the Travel of her Soul and meet them with Joy in that great Day  Then  he charged all his Brethren and Sisters in gene∣ral as they would answer it before God that they should carry it dutiful to their dear Mother And for his eldest Brother  William  at whose House he lay sick his Prayer was that he might be swallowed up of Christ and Love to Souls and be more and more exemplary in his Life and successful in his Ministry and finish his Course with Joy  His next Brother's Name was  Andrew  a Citizen of  London  who was with him and saw him in his tri∣umphing State but his necessary Business calling him away he could not then be by yet he was not for∣got but he was thus blessed  The God of Heaven re∣member my poor Brother at  London  The Lord make him truly rich in giving him the Pearl of great Price and make him a Fellow Citizen with the Saints and of the Houshold of God the Lord deliver him from the Sins of that City may the World be kept out of his Heart and Christ dwell there Oh that he may be as his Name is a strong Man and that I may meet him with you  Then  he called his next Brother whose Name was  James  whom he hoped God had made him a spiritual Father to to whom he thus addressed himself  Brother  James  I hope the Lord hath given thee a goodly Heritage the Lines are fallen to thee in pleasant Places the Lord is thy Portion I hope the Lord hath shewed thee the Worth of Christ  Hold on dear Brother Christ Heaven and Glory are worth striving for the Lord give thee more Abundance of his Grace  Then  his next Brother  Abraham  was called to whom he speak to this Purpose  the Blessing of the God of  A∣braham  rest upon thee the Lord make thee a Father of many spiritual Children  His  fifth  Brother was  Joseph  whom he blessed in this Manner  Let him bless thee Oh  Joseph  that bless∣ed him that was separated from his Brethren O that his everlasting Arms may take hold on thee It is enough if yet thou mayst live in his Sight My Heart hath been working towards thee poor  Joseph  and I am not with∣out Hopes that the Arms of the Almighty will embrace thee The God of thy Father bless the with the Blessing of Heaven above  The next  was his Sister  Mary  to whom he spoke thus  Poor Sister  Mary  thy Body is weak and thy Days will be filled with Bitterness thy Name is  Marah  the Lord sweeten all with his Grace and Peace and give thee Health in thy Soul Be patient make sure of Christ and all is well  Then  his other Sister whose Name was  Sarah  was called whom he thus blessed  Sister  Sarah  thy Body is strong and healthful Oh that thy Soul may be so too The Lord make thee first a wise Virgin and then a Mother in  Israel  a Pattern of Modesty Humility and Holiness  Then another Brother  Jacob  was called whom he blessed after this Manner  The Lord make thee an Isra∣elite indeed in whom there is no Guile Oh that thou mayest learn to wrestle with God and like a Prince may∣est prevail and not goe without the Blessing  Then he prayed for his youngest Brother  Benjamin  who was then but an Infant  Poor little  Benjamin  O that the Father of the Fatherless would take Care of thee poor Child that thou which never sawest thy Father upon Earth mayst see him with Joy in Heaven The Lord be thy Father and Portion mayest thou prove the Son of thy Mother's right Hand and the Joy of her Age  O that none of us all may be found amongst the unconverted in the Day of Judgment O that eve∣ry one of us may appear with our honoured Father and dear Mother before Christ with Joy that they may say Lord here are we and the Chil∣dren which thou hast given us Oh that we may live to God here and live with him hereafter  And now my dear Mother Brethren and Sisters Farewell I leave you for a while and I commend you to God and to the Word of his Grace which is able to build you up and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are sanctified  And now dear Lord my Work is done I have finished my Course I have fought the good Fight and henceforth there remaineth for me a Crown of Righ∣teousness Now come dear Lord Jesus come quickly  Then the Minister came to give him his last Visit and to do the Office of an inferiour Angel to help to convey his blessed Soul to Glory who was now even upon  Mount Pisgah  and had a full Sight of that goodly Land at a little Distance When this Minister spake to him his Heart was in a mighty Flame of Love and Joy which drew Fears of Joy from him  being almost amazed to hear a Man just a dying talk as if he had been with  Jesus  and came from the im∣mediate Presence of God O the Smiles that were then in his Face and the unspeakable Joy that was in his Heart one might have read  Grace  and  Glory  in his Countenance Oh the Praise the triumphant Praises that he put up And every one must speak Praise about him or else they made a Jar in his Harmony  And indeed most did as well as they could help him in Praise So that I never heard nor knew more Praise given to God in one Room than in his Chamber  A little before he died in the Prayer or rather Prais∣es he was so wrapped up with Admiration and Joy that he could scarce forbear shouting for Joy In the Conclusion of the Duty with Abundance of Faith and Fervency he said aloud  Amen Amen  And now his Desires will soon be satisfied Death comes apace to do his Office his Jaws are loosened more and more and quiver greatly his Hands and Feet are as cold as Clay and a cold Sweat is upon him But Oh how glad was he when he felt his Spirit just a going Never was Death more welcome to any Mor∣tal I think Though the Pangs of Death were strong yet that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory made him indure those bitter Pains with much Patience and Courage In the Extremity of his Pains he desired his eldest Brother to lay him a little lower and to take away one Pillow from him that he might die with the more Ease His Brother replied that he durst not for a World do any thing that might hasten his Death a Moment Then he was well satisfied and did sweetly resign himself up wholly to God's Disposal And after a few Minutes with a sudden Motion gathering up all his Strength he gave himself a little Turn on one Side and in the Twinkling of an Eye departed to the Lord  And now blessed Soul thy Longings are satisfied and thou seest and feelest a thousand Times more than thou didst upon Earth and yet thou canst bear it with Delight thou art now welcomed to thy Father's House by Christ the Beloved of thy Soul Now thou  hast heard him say Come thou blessed of my Father and Well done good and faithful Servant enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord and wear that Crown which was prepared for thee before the Foundation of the World  Oh that all the Relations which thou hast left be∣hind thee may live thy Life and die thy Death and live with Christ and thee for ever and ever  Amen Amen  He died  June  Aged    and was buried in  Kel∣shall  Church in  Hartfordshire  FINIS
