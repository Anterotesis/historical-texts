as succinctly as possible And  I A brief Geographical Account of  Scotland    SCOTLAND  is bounded on the North by the  Irish  Sea and  England  from which it is divided by  Solway Firth  and the Rivers  Esk  and  Kexsop  on the West Border by the  Cheviot  Hills in the  Middle Marches  and by the lower Parts of the  Tweed  on the East Border On the East it is bounded by the  German  Sea on the North by the  Deucaledonian  Sea and on the West by the great Western Ocean  Its greatest Length from  Dungsbyhead  or  John  of  Grot  's  house  in  Caithness  to the  Mull  of  Galloway  towards  Ireland  is no more than about  Scots  Miles but if we reckon directly North from  Dumfries  or the said  Mull  of  Galloway  to the utmost Parts of  Caithness  or  Strathnavern  the Length will not be so much and less still if we reckon from  Berwick  to either of these Places  Its Breadth from the Point of  Ardnamurchan  near the Isle of  Mull  about the middle Part of  Scotland  in the West to  Buchanness  in the East Parts towards the North is about  Scots  Miles but the Sea running up into the Land or the Land thrusting out into the Sea in many Places makes the Breadth of it everywhere else very various and disproportionable for in the South Parts it is seldom Miles over and in the North Parts beyond  Inverness  not so many so that there is no House above or Miles from salt Water  Besides the main Land there are about Islands some of them very considerable which may be distinguished into several Classes The Western Islands called  Hebrides  or  Aebudae  by  Latin  Authors the  Orcades  or  Orkney  Islands the Islands of  Shetland  or  Zetland  and some few in the Firth of  Forth    The whole Country abounds in Lakes and Rivers many whereof running into Creeks and Arms of the Sea which in several Places are very wide and deep afford great and commodious Opportunities for Fishing and Shipping But 'tis much to be regretted that the Land is neither cultivated nor the Fishing and Shipping carried on and improved to so much Advantage as might be expected  Tho' the Soil is not generally so level and fruitful as that of  England  yet the South Parts of  Scotland  are far more pleasant than and preferable to the North Parts of  England  and there are everywhere all Things necessary for human Life And not only sufficient for the Inhabitants but also to export and exchange for such foreign Commodities as the People want and to return considerable Sums  II Of the most remarkable Lakes and Rivers in  Scotland    THE most remarkable Lakes in  Scotland  are  Lochtay  and  Lochness  and  Lochlevin  Which all send forth Rivers of the same Name with themselves  Lochlomond  which sends forth the River of  Lomond  and  Lochiern  which sends the River  Iern  'Tis observed that  Lochness Lochtay  and  Lochiern  seldom freeze  Lochmyrton  in  Galloway  is another and remarkable for this That one Part of it generally freezes in the Winterseason and the other Part seldom does  There is a  Loch  in  Straitherrach  in the Lord  Lovat  's Lands which never freezes however severe the Frost be till  February  and then in one Night's time it freezes all over and if the Frost continue two Nights the Ice grows very thick There is a Lake of the same Nature call'd  Lochmonar  in the Earl of  Cromarty  's Lands in the North and there is another Lake in  Straglash  at a Place call'd  Glencanich  in a high Ground betwixt the Tops of two Mountains the middle of which Lake is always frozen throughout the Summer notwithstanding the strong Reflexions of the Sunbeams from the Mountains which melt the Ice at the Sides of the Lake The Ground round the Lake has a constant Verdure as if there were a perpetual Spring and Cattle grow sooner fat by that Grass than anywhere else And this is so much the more remarkable that there are several other Lakes in the Neighbourhood of as high a Situation wherein no such thing is seen  In  Linlithgowshire  is a Lake call'd  Lochcoat Lough  from whence a Stream runs under a neighbouring Mountain the Murmur of which is heard among the Stones and after it has run thus under  Ground for about two hundred Paces it issues with great Force from a Fountain about three Feet broad and forms a Stream which turns a Watermill  For the Conveniency of Trade and Fishing there are so many Inlets of the Sea that there is scarce any Part of it as I have said above Miles distant from some Bay Creek or Arm of the Ocean and these afford many Harbours several of them very good and capable of receiving Men of War and Ships of the greatest Burden  The principal Rivers in  Scotland  are TAY which divides it in the Middle and running by  Scone Perth  and  Dundee  empties itself into the  German  Ocean In the Southern Parts the FORTH and TWEED run into the same CLYDE runs into the Western Sea as ESK ANNAND NITH KEN DEE and CREE do into the  Irish  In the North DEE and DON run into the  German  Ocean as SPEY and NESS do into  Murray  Firth  The most convenient for Trade are TAY which is navigable to  Perth  FORTH and CLYDE which if join'd by a Canal near the Place where the  Romans  formerly built their Wall of about Miles long to defend their Province from the  Scots  and  Picts  would open a Communication betwixt the East and West Seas to the great Advancement of the Commerce of the whole Island There was much Talk of it about the Time of the  Union  but as it would undoubtedly be attended with very great Charges and other Difficulties the Project seems to be laid quite aside  I am the briefer in my Account of the Lakes and Rivers in  Scotland  because I shall be obliged to be more particular upon them in their respective Places  III Of the Fisheries in  Scotland  includeing that of Pearls  THE Salmonfishery is particularly the Boast and Delight of the  Scots  insomuch that for it they too much neglect all the rest  Their SALMON are accounted the best in  Europe  and tho' their Barrels be a Third less than that of  Berwick  yet they have yielded Livres more  per  Barrel in  France  partly because of their Goodness and partly because better cured wherein the Magistrates and Towncouncil of  Aberdeen  take a very particular Care Salmon abound not only in the navigable Rivers of  Scotland  but in those which are less in most Parts of the Kingdom and they valued them so much formerly that in several of their old Acts of Parliament they forbad selling them to  England  except for Gold  Clyde  abounds with Salmon for which the Town of  Renfrew  has been famous and Bishop  Lesley  in his Description of  Scotland  says They used in his Time to employ sixty Vessels in Fishing most of Spring and Summer but 'tis much short of  Aberdeen  where the same Author says the Rivers  Dee  and  Don  exceed all those of the Kingdom for Number and Goodness of Salmon For which he assigns this Reason That they delight in clear Streams which occasions our Rivers in  Scotland  to abound more with Salmon than those of other Countries where the Rivers are more muddy The other Places most remarkable for Salmonfishing in  Scotland  are in the  Dovern  at  Bamf  the Rivers  Nesse Nairn Findorn Lossey  and  Spey  in  Murray  the latter abounds with Salmon for Miles together  Lochlomond  in  Lenox  is remarkable for Salmon of an excellent Taste  Lochou  in  Argyll  the like And there is good Salmonfishing in the Rivers  Lough  and  Speynie  in  Lochaber  in the  Bay of  Cromarty  near  Dingwal  Castle and in the Rivers  Tay  and  Tweed  and other smaller Rivers in the bordering Counties They have marl'd or speckled Salmon in  Harries Northvist  and  Benbecula  And in the Isle of  Sky  there are no less than Rivers all abounding with Salmon  As to their CODfishing Mr  Spruel  an eminent  Scots  Merchant who laid an Account of the Product of the Kingdom for Trade before their Parliament some Years ago says he was inform'd by a  Yarmouth  Man who use to buy those Fish and Salt on the  Scots  Coast that he has sometimes got four thousand cur'd Fish in a Voyage at  d  or  d  apiece and retail'd them again from  d  to  s    d  apiece which shews what vast Advantage might be made of this Trade since the  Scots  Cod are reckon'd as good or better than those of  Newfoundland  And what contibutes much to the Cheapness of this and the Herringfishery in  Scotland  is that they are caught with fewer Hands and Vessels of far less Expence than Doggers which must be well mann'd and strong because oblig'd to lie at Sea whereas the  Scots  catch those Fish in their own Creeks Bays and Harbours where few Hands and open Vessels are for the most part sufficient because they are seldom exposed to any Danger by Storms being always near the Shore and laid up at Night  HERRINGS abound on all the Coasts of the Kingdom but especially on the Western Isles which are reckon'd the best and fattest tho' not so large as those taken on the Eastern and Northern Coasts The  Scots  Herringfishing is accounted the best in the World and the  Dutch  have got a great Part of their Wealth by it  A Fishery was attempted in the Isles by King  Charles  I in Conjunction with some Merchants and a Magazine was erected for that Use in  Hermetra  one of the  Harries  Islands and another in the Isle of  Vacksay  but the unhappy Civil War coming on it was not prosecuted It was renew'd by King  Charles  II and succeeded well for a Time The Fish they caught were accounted the best in  Europe  and yielded a Price accordingly but the King withdrawing his Money afterwards to supply his pressing Occasions the Merchants were displeased at it and differing among themselves did also withdraw theirs which ruin'd the Design  Some  Dutch  Families settled in the Village of  Stornway  in the Isle of  Lewes  soon after that Prince's Restoration and so much improved the Inhabitants in the Fishing Trade during the small Time of their Abode there that they still exceed all those of the neighbouring Isles and Continent they brought the Natives a great deal of Money likewise for their Sea and LandFowl But King  Charles  II being prevail'd on to send away the  Dutch  it was a great Loss to the Country  Herrings are sometimes bought in the Isles for  d per  Barrel and when cured and sent abroad yield from to  s per  Barrel and sometimes Barrels of white Herrings have been exported to  France  from  Clyde  in a Season besides what were exported from  Dunbar  and other Parts of the Kingdom to  France  and other Nations which may serve as a Specimen to shew how capable that Trade is of Improvement especially considering the Situation of the West of  Scotland  and the Isles from whence they may be a Month sooner at Market with them than from any Part of  England  and  Holland  which with the Advantage of taking and curing them cheaper and sooner than the  Dutch  can possibly do considering how far they have to sail backward and forward what Risques they run at Sea and what Numbers of Tenders they are obliged to send to and again betwixt their own Country and their Doggers with Provisions Salt  c  they might soon be outdone  in that profitable Trade by the Inhabitants of  Great Britain  who may lie ashore at Night and land their Fish as soon as caught without any Danger from Tempests or Enemies many of those Bays where the Herring abound being very safe for Ships to ride in  Whales  in abundance frequent the Islands of  Fladden Orkney  and  Lewes  One hundred and fourteen run ashore on the Island of  Orkney  at one time in the Year  Cod Tusk  and  Ling  are caught in vast Plenty upon all their Coasts  Haddocks Sturgeon Turbut Trouts Perch Pike Scate Greyberd Maycril Keeling Whiting Seaurchin Catfish Cockpadle Lyths Spirlings Soles Flukes Garvie Eels  are also caught on the  Scotish  Coasts in great Plenty for Homeconsumption  Otters  whose Skins are useful for Muffs  c  are very numerous in the Isles  Shellfish of all sorts as  Lobsters Crabs Oysters  are also found in vast Quantities in the Western Islands the latter so large that they must be cut in three or four Pieces to be eaten  Cockles Muscles Limpets Wilks Scollops  and  Spouts  are cast up by the Tide in such Numbers on the Isles that the People cannot consume them  PEARL being the Product of Fish it is proper to discourse of the  Scots  Pearl here Mr  Spruel  the Merchant abovementioned who understood the Pearltrade best of any Man in that Kingdom having dealt in it above forty Years says He has sometimes given a hundred Rixdollars which is near  l  for one  Scots  Pearl and that he had  Scots  Pearl as fine clear and more transparent than any Oriental Pearl Tho' the latter be more easily match'd because they are all of a yellow Water yet Foreigners covet  Scots  Pearl The more Wrinkles there are in a Pearlshell the more Sign it is of the  Age and Goodness of a Pearl for the smooth Shells are young and barren Therefore he proposed that a Law should be made to forbid the Fishing of young Pearl for the longer they stay in the Water the more valuable they are So that he would have no Shells taken up less than four Inches in Length or two or three in Breadth and that none should be allowed to offer any Pearl to be sold that weighs less than five Grains which is as reasonable as Laws to prevent the taking of the young Fry of Salmon since Pearl are of much more Value And that they might have Time to grow and increase he proposes That Pearlfishing should be forbid except once in ten Years at least because he has been sorry to see some Thousands of young Pearls offer'd to Sale that were of no manner of Value whereas had they lain in the Waters their due Time they might have been worth from four to fifty Crowns apiece  Pearl is found in most Places of the Nation where Salmon are taken and once in twenty Years he says there is a great Pearlfishing in  Scotland  This does not hinder but that Pearlshells of the Size he proposes or larger may be taken up at any time when found and these are probably to be had among the unfrequented Isles  Particular Places where Pearl abound are the Rivers in the Isle of  Skye  where they are frequently found in black Muscles especially in the Rivers  Kilmartin  and  Ord  where Pearls have lately been found of  l per  Piece and in a freshwater Lake near the Southside of  Locheinardstad  In that same Island there are also Muscles that breed Pearl  Tho' the small Pearl be not so useful for Ornament yet they may be of very good Use in Physick and make a fine Article in the Apothecary's Bills being reputed the chief of all Cordials and very good against the Plague violent and pestilential Fevers Fluxes Heartburning Giddiness of the Head  Trembling of the Heart  c  which is sufficient to shew that the Pearlfishery well deserves Encouragement since we may be supply'd with it much cheaper at Home than from the  Indies    IV Of the Cattle Horses Fowls  c  of  Scotland    THE Country in general abounds in Flocks of Sheep and Herds of Cattle which are generally black except in Cornsoils where they seldom breed or keep any more than are necessary for the Plough or the Pail But 'tis observable that such as are bred in the Corncountries are much larger than those bred in other Parts and equal in Size to those bred in some Parts of  England  even where the Land seems to be better  In general their Sheep and Cattle are much smaller than those of  England  especially in Pasturelands yet are they of a far sweeter and more delicious Taste The  Highlanders  bring great Numbers of them yearly into the Lowlands where some are fatted but the Bulk of them and also many of those bred in the Lowlands are sent into divers Parts of  England  especially to  St Faith's  near  Norwich  where they turn out to good Account as I have observed in its Place  They have also very many  Hogs  and an incredible Number of  Goats  particularly in the North and Highlands the latter they eat themselves but the former they pickle and export as they likewise do vast Quantities of  salt Beef    In the Southern Counties there are no  Deer  except in Gentlemens Parks but everywhere else they are in great Plenty  They breed great Numbers of  Horses  especially in  Galloway  and the  Highlands  small indeed but capable of great Fatigue especially if we consider  that they are not only more proper for the Saddle and other Uses in that Country which being hilly will not admit in many Places of Teams and Carriages but are more hardy than Horses of a larger Size and will thrive upon what would starve great Horses Nevertheless in many Places of the  Lowlands  they can breed Horses fit for War Coach or Carriage  Scotland  has not only Plenty of  domestick Fowl  such as are common to other Countries but many that are peculiar to themselves especially in the Islands where they are in such Multitudes as the Inhabitants can neither consume nor vend half of them but their Trade for them will still increase as it has done since the  Union    Their  Fowl  and  Eggs  afford a large Fund of Trade for Food and their  Feathers  for Bedding and other Uses Their Fat is made use of by the Inhabitants not only in many Cases where Oil is necessary but likewise for Physick  V Of the Linen and Woollen Manufactures of  Scotland    FLAX  abounds in  Scotland  so that besides what they consume themselves they export great Quantities of  Linen  brown and whitened which is one of the greatest Manufactures of the Kingdom and if duly regulated and encouraged as it is more and more since the  Union  might save a great deal of Money in the Island besides what it may bring in to it for the  Scots  have improved their  Linen Manufacture  much of late and besides fine Linen make very good  Holland Cambrick Muslins  plain and striped  Calicoes Damask Ticken  for Beds  c  white and dyed  Threads Laces Tape  c  Mr  Spruel  in his  Account current betwixt  Scotland  and  England says He has known out of a Pound  of Flax of  Scots  Growth which cost but  d  six Spangles of fine Yarn spun which was sold at  Glasgow  at about  s    d per  Spangle which made the Product of that  d  to the Spinners  s  and made into fine Muslin that same Pound of Flax amounted to or Dollars which is  l    s    d  or  l    s  the Charges of Weaving and Whitening deducted He adds That from one Pound of  Scots  Flax Lacemakers have made  Lace  to the Value of  l  Sterling which is sufficient to shew how much the Linen Manufacture may be improv'd there and how many poor Women who are not capable of employing themselves otherwise may get a Livelihood by it and what Money it may bring into the Nation  Their HEMP is also capable of being improved not only to save Money in the Island which is exported for  Canvas Sailcloth  c but also to export and to make  Nets  for their Fishery and other Uses  The numerous and large Flocks of Sheep they have in  Scotland  produce abundance of WOOL from whence come Manufactures of several Sorts as  Broadcloth Coarse  or  Housewife'scloth Fingrims Serges Bays Crapes Temmin  Glasgow  Plaids Worsted Camblets  and other Stuffs and  Stockens  for Homeconsumption and Export besides their  Tallow  and  Skins  Their Wool in general is not so good as that of  England  yet they have brought their Broadcloth lately to a great Perfection but can never equal  England  in that Part of Woollen Manufacture Nevertheless it is very proper for  Serges Bays Camblets Shaloons  and other Stuffs and by due Regulation is capable of great Improvement for a foreign Trade They are come to a great Perfection in making  Stuffs  and for  Plaids  I shall observe byandby they exceed all the World  An Instance of what great Improvement may be made of their Wool we have from Mr  Spruel  in his  Account current    viz  That they make such fine Worsted Stockens at  Aberdeen  that they yield and  s  a Pair for Womens Stockens which is sufficient to shew that they are capable of making Stockens at lower Rates especially considering that they have store of very good Wool brought thither from the Highlands and Isles which because sold at the Cross of  Aberdeen  is commonly called  CrossWool  The most remarkable Places besides in  Scotland  for good Wool are  Galloway  and  Tweedale  from which great Improvement might be made in  Bays Serges  and  Shaloons    The  Scots  Plaids are a Manufacture in which they exceed all Nations as I have said both as to Colour and Fineness They have of late been pretty much fansied in  England  for  Beds Hangings Windowcurtains  and  Nightgowns  for both Sexes so that Attempts have been made at  Norwich  to imitate them but they fall much short of the  Scots  in Colour Fineness and Workmanship as is evident at first Sight Their greatest Trade for their Woollen Manufactures and other Commodities has for many Years been with the  United Netherlands  where they have a  Conservator  who serves both for a Consul and Envoy to take care of the Affairs of their Trade being part of the antient Privileges they enjoyed by Treaties with the Dukes of  Burgundy  and others when Sovereigns of the  Netherlands  From this Trade the Towns of  Rotterdam  and  Terveer  have acquired considerable Wealth in Return for which the  Scots  have been always well esteemed in those Provinces and the States allow them Churches and Maintenance for their Ministers  VI Of the Grain and Pulse of  Scotland    THE WHEAT of  Scotland  is so excellent that  Joseph Scaliger  who had been in the Country says No Bread in  Europe  is comparable to what is made of it for Whiteness Lightness and easy Digestion It abounds in the  Mers Lothian Gavrie  c so that they have not only enough for their own Consumption but for Exportation  OATS are the most universal Grain of the Kingdom and exceed those in  England  for all Uses They grow very well everywhere and in such Quantities as afford a considerable Fund for Export both in Grain and Meal and make very good Bread and Drink  PEASE they have in great Plenty both for their own Consumption and for Exportation and they are so good of the Kind that in some Parts of the Country the labouring Husbandmen make good nourishing Bread of them  BEANS they have also in great plenty for their own Use and for Export  BARLEY grows likewise very well in  Scotland  but they sow more of that Sort they call  Beer  which has four Rows of Grain upon an Ear whereas Barley has but two Of this they make good  Bread Broth Ale  and  Beer  and export great Quantities  RYE grows also very well in  Scotland  and makes good Bread but this they don't cultivate so much as they do the Grains abovementioned  VII Of the Mountains Wood Timber  c  of  Scotland    THE most remarkable Mountains of  Scotland  are the  Grampian  Mountains which run from East to West from near  Aberdeen  to  Cowal  in  Argyllshire    almost the whole Breadth of the Kingdom famous for the Battle fought on them betwixt the  Romans  and the ancient  Scots  and  Caledonians  under the Conduct of  Galgacus  as we find in  Tacitus  The next most remarkable Chain of Mountains are those of  Lammermoor  which run from the Eastern Coast in the  Mers  a great way West Next to these are  Pentland  Hills which run thro'  Lothian  and join the Mountains of  Tweedale  and these again are join'd by others which run thro' the whole Breadth of the Island Other remarkable Mountains are those called  Cheviot  Hills in the Border betwixt the two Kingdoms  Drumbenderlaw  and  NorthBerwicklaw  both in  EastLothian Arthur  's  seat  in  MidLothian Cairnapple  in  WestLothian Tentock  in  Clydsdale Brinmore  in  Argyll  the  Ochel  Mountains in  Perthshire  the  Lowmonds  and  Largolaw  in  Fife  in  Angus Dundeelaw  and Part of the  Grampians  in  Caithness Ord  and in the  Orkney  Islands the Mountains of  Hoy    There are many large Woods of OAK in  Scotland  which afford Materials for  Building  and  Shipping  and for the Husbandman's Use and the Country is very improveable this way if Planting were more encouraged however they have at present not only such as are fit for the Uses abovementioned but also for  Pipestaves  and  Barrels  and their  Bark  is of Use to the  Tanners  great Quantities of which are annually exported to  Ireland  and elsewhere They have likewise ASH Trees ELMS and others fit for  Building  and other  domestick  Uses and great Forests of FIR which afford Materials for  Building  and  Shipping  and might with due Care afford  Pitch  and  Tar  without being obliged to bring such large Quantities from the  Northern  Countries as is usually done by the Inhabitants of  Great Britain    There were formerly many great Woods in  Scotland  among which the Forest of  Caledonia  was  famous but there are now scarce any Remains of it  The Woods are more rare than formerly in the Southern Parts of the Kingdom of which the most remarkable now left are those of  Hamilton Calendar  and  Torwood  But in the North especially in  Perthshire Lochaber Badenoch  and  Mar  there are many Forests some of them and some Miles in Length  They have abundance of  Fruittrees  of all Sorts in their Gardens and Orchards and might by Improvement not only have sufficient to afford them Fruit for Homeconsumption but also Cyder for their own Drinking and Export  VIII Of the Medicinal Waters Fountains Springs  c  THE more remarkable Medicinal Fountains in  Scotland  are  Moffat Wells  which spring from the Top of a Rock near the Town of that Name in  Annandale  The Wells are two in Number near one another the higher Well runs through whitish and crystalline Stones and the lower through black ones resembling Marcasites of Antimony The Smell of the Water is like that of Gunpowder and it dyes Silver of a black Colour To the Stones of the upper Well grows a Matter resembling stinking Sulphur of Antimony of a yellowish red Colour the Stones of the lower Well are of the Colour of Antimony and some of them contain a metallick Matter that sparkles like Antimony Where the Stream of the lower Well runs down into a neighbouring Brook there sticks to the Rock a whitish Salt and perhaps a nitrous Matter which has the diuretick Virtue of the Water Those Waters also purge by Stool and Vomit and are very good against Colick and Nephritick Pains because they powerfully remove  the Obstructions of the Bowels They are outwardly applied to Ulcers and against Pains in the Joints they are strongest in their Operation in the driest Season of the Summer and Autumn but are not so good in a rainy or in the Winterseason  Mahon  's  Well  near St  Mahon  's Church has the same Virtue but does not operate so strongly and there is a Well of the same Nature discover'd not many Years ago at  Hallyards  within six Miles of  Edinburgh    At  Kinghorne  a very clear and cold Water flows from the Clefts of a Rock which quickly passes through the Body is of excellent Use for recovering a lost Appetite and against the Gravel and Stone it is outwardly applied to watry and itching Eyes and against Redness and Pimples in the Face The famous Dr  P Anderson  wrote upon its Usefulness There flows also from the same Rock a whitish viscid Liquor which is an excellent Cosmetick  Arthrey Well  two Miles North of  Stirling  flows from a Mountain where is a Copper Mine with some Mixture of Gold and Silver The Water is very cold and being tinctur'd with the Minerals it flows through is of Use against outward Distempers  In  Glenelg  at a Place called  Achignigle  is a Stream which turns Holly into a greenish Stone of which they make Moulds for casting Musketbullets and Meltingpots for melting Brass and other Metals and Whirls for Womens Spindles  There is a petrifying Fountain near the Castle of  Slaine  the Water of which dropping from a natural Cave presently turns into Pyramids of Stones which are brittle and make good Lime there is another in  Hamilton  Wood the Stones made by which resemble putrid Moss  At  Monkton  near  Edinburgh  is a Well called  The routing Well  because of the Noise it makes before Tempests from the Part of the Well which  looks to that Quarter of the Sky from whence the Tempest is to blow  There is another on the Westside of  Campsey  Hills which divides  Stirlingshire  from  Lenox  whose Water makes People drunk  IX Of Precious Stones and other valuable Commodities  THE following valuable Commodities and Precious Stones are found in different Parts of  Scotland    Coral  and  Coraline  in the Isles of  Lewes Sky  and  Jura    Ambergris  on the Coasts of the Islands  Bernera Southvist Bintire  and  Orkney    Marcasites Lapis Ceranius Lapis Hecticus Agat  of different Sizes and Colours all in the Isle of  Sky    Crystal  in the Isles of  Sky Arran  and  St Kilda    Fullers Earth  in the Isle of  Sky    Fine Shells  which pass in  Africa  for Money in the Isles  Loadstone  in the Isle of  Cannay    Sperma Ceti  on the Coasts of  Orkney  and other Isles  Mines of  Gold  in  Crawford Moor  Also  Azure  in the Reign of  James  IV  Silver  Mines three Miles South of  Linlithgow  in the Reign of  James  VI  Copper  in  Airthrey  near  Stirling    Lead  in  Clydsdale  of which the Earl of  Hopton  makes good Account  Lead  and  Tin  in  Orkney    Iron  at  Dumfernling  in  Fife    Coal  in  Lothian Fife  c  Freestone Slate Limestone Marble  in great Plenty all over the Country  And Sir  Robert Sibbalds  asserts that they have also  Diamonds Rubies Carbuncles Hyacinths Jaspers Cornelians Amethysts  c to whom I refer you for farther Satisfaction on this Head  X Of the Customs Manners Language  c  of the  Scots    THE  Scots  are divided into HIGHLANDERS who call themselves the antient  Scots  and into LOWLANDERS who are a Mixture of antient  Scots Picts Britons French English Danes Germans Hungarians  and others  Buchanan  describes the Customs of the  Highlanders  graphically thus In their Diet Apparel and Housholdfurniture they follow the Parsimony of the Ancients they provide their Diet by Fishing and Hunting and boil their Flesh in the Paunch or Skin of a Beast While they hunt they eat it raw after having squeez'd out the Blood Their Drink is the Broth of boil'd Meat or Whey they keep some Years and drink it plentifully in their Entertainments but most of them drink Water Their Bread is of  Oats  and  Barley  the only Grain produced in their Country which they prepare very artfully They eat a little of it in the Morning and contenting themselves with that hunt or go about their Business without eating any more till Night They delight most in Cloaths of several Colours especially strip'd the Colours they affect most are Purple and Blue Their Ancestors as do most of them still made use of Plaids very much variegated but now they make them rather of dark Colours resembling that of the Crops of Heath that they may not be discovered while they lie in the Heaths waiting for their Game Being rather wrapped up than covered with those Plaids they endure all the Rigours of the Seasons and sometimes sleep covered all over  with Snow At Home they lie upon the Ground having under them Fern or Heath covered with a Sheet or Blanket the latter laid with the Roots undermost so as it is almost equal to Feathers for Softness but much more healthful for the Quality of Heath being to draw out superfluous Humours when they lie down weary and faint upon it at Night they rise fresh and vigorous in the Morning They affect this hard way of sleeping and if at any time they come into other Places of the Country where there is better Accommodation they pull the Coverings off the Bed and lie down upon them wrapped in their Plaids lest they should be spoiled by this barbarous Effeminacy as they call it  The LOWLANDERS partake much of the Temper of the People of whom we have mentioned them to be composed but most resemble the  French  occasioned by the long League betwixt the two Nations their mutual Commerce frequent Intermarriages and Custom of travelling into  France  to study the Law and other Sciences and by their affecting to serve in the  French  Armies But since the Union of the Crowns the  English  Customs and Way of Living have obtained much in the  Lowlands  where the  English  Tongue has been their natural Language for above Years but still retains more ancient  Saxon  and  French  This being extraordinary and perhaps singular that a foreign Language should prevail in a Country altogether independent of  England  and where the Inhabitants are of another Lineage and maintained such fierce and long Wars to preserve their distinct Sovereignty the  Scotish  Antiquaries and Historians give the following Reasons of it  The frequent  Saxon  Auxiliaries sent to assist the  Picts  against the  Scots  which occasion'd many of those  Saxons  to settle in the  Lowlands  of  Scotland  then possessed by the  Picts    The last considerable Effort made by the  Picts  in Conjunction with the  English  to recover their Country against  Donald  V of  Scotland  who after he had defeated the  English  and  Picts  upon the River  Jedd  in  Tiviotdale  neglecting to improve his Victory was afterwards surprised by them near  Berwick  and taken Prisoner after a great Slaughter of his Men Upon this Success the  English  under the Conduct of  Osbreth  and  Ella  possessed themselves of the Country as far as  Dumbarton  without restoring the  Picts  the major Part of which retired to  Denmark  and  Norway  and the Remainder were cut off by the  English  to prevent their calling in Foreigners Thus the  English  continued in Possession of that Part of the Country from the Year till about the Year when King  Gregory the Great  of  Scotland  recovered the Country and the  Scotish  Proprietors the Possession of their Estates But willingly entertained the  English  Commonalty and Husbandmen who were as desirous to stay their own Country being at that time infested by the  Danes  and they rather chose to be under the Dominion of the  Scots  who were Christians than under that of the  Danes  who were Pagans  Great Numbers of the  English  came into  Scotland  to assist King  Malcolm  III against the Usurper  Macbeth  whom he rewarded after his Victory with Possessions in  Scotland    A great many  English  came to  Scotland  after the  Norman  Conquest with  Edgar Atheling  and his Sister  Margaret  who was afterwards married to King  Malcolm  abovementioned which makes the Reasons of the  Scots  Historians for the prevailing of the  English  Language in the Lowlands of  Scotland  very probable  It has been gaining Ground upon the old  Scots  Language ever since which is now confined to the Highlands and the Isles where most of those of  Note do also understand  English  Tho' about Years ago the old People in  Galloway  generally understood the  Erse  or ancient  Scots  Language which is now worn quite out  XI Of the Religion and Ecclesiastical Government of  Scotland    THE  Estabished Religion  of  Scotland  since the Revolution and confirmed by the Act of  Union  is what is called  The Presbyterian  being a Church Government by  Pastors Teachers Elders  and  Deacons  Before the Revolution the Church was govern'd by Bishops but they not coming so readily into the new Settlement as the Presbyterians did were abolished  The Ecclesiastical Courts as they now stand are Four  viz  The  Kirk Session  consisting of the Minister Elders and Deacons in each Parish who consider the Affairs of the Parish as a Religious Society They judge in all Matters of lesser Scandals can suspend from the Communion and regulate all Particulars relating to publick Worship and the Poor  The  Presbytery  which consists of the Minister and one Elder from five to ten twelve or more neighbouring Parishes who chuse one of these Ministers to be Praeses or Moderator Here are tried Appeals from the Kirk Sessions and here they inspect into the Behaviour of the Ministers and Elders within their respective Bounds They supply vacant Parishes ordain Pastors examine and license Schoolmasters and young Students for probationary Preachers and judge when or on whom to inflict the greater Excommunication  The  Provincial Synod  This is composed of all the Members of several adjacent Presbyteries It meets twice a Year at some principal Place  within its Bounds Is open'd by a Sermon Their Business is to receive Correspondents from the neighbouring Synods who are a Check upon one another to determine Appeals from the  Presbyteries  in their District to inquire into and censure the Behaviour of the Presbyteries themselves They likewise have Power to transport or remove a Minister from one Place to another which often occasions great Disturbance Hence lie Appeals however to  The  General Assembly  the highest Ecclesiastical Power in the Kingdom in which presides a LordCommissioner a Man of the first Quality as a Representative of the King's Person All the Members of this are annually elected and the last Moderator opens the new Sessions with a Sermon  The same Discipline as to the main of the several Forms and Proceedings was observed in the Episcopal Times only they had no LayElders the Bishop or his Deputy being a Minister or Ministers within the Bounds presided in all Presbyteries and Diocesan Synods as the Archbishop of  St Andrews  did in the National or General Assemblies For it must be observed that Episcopacy in  Scotland  differed from the same Thing in  England  for here it was as low as the Nature of an Episcopal Church could admit The Bishops were  sine quibus non  they had no Laychancellors but did all Things  Presbyterorum Consilio    The Number of Churches in  Scotland  since the Reformation is much less than it was before However there are none now of peculiar or exempt Jurisdiction They are about beside some few Chapels which make up Presbyteries included in  Provincial Synods  which formerly were divided into  two Provinces  under two Archbishops and twelve Bishops as follow  The Archbishoprick of ST ANDREW'S contained all  Fife  Part of  Perthshire Angus  and  Mernis    The Bishoprick of EDINBURGH contained the  Three Lothians  some few Parishes excepted  Sterlingshire  and the  Merse    DUNKELD contained the North Parts of  Perthshire  and some Part of  Angus  and  Lothian    DUMBLANE contained the West and South Parts of  Perthshire    BREECHIN contained Part of  Angus  and  Mernis    ABERDEEN contained all  Aberdeenshire  and Part of  Bamff    MURRAY contained  Murray Nairn  Part of  Bamff  and  Inverness    ROSS contained the Shires of  Ross Cromarty  and Part of  Inverness    CAITHNESS contained  Caithness Sutherland  and  Strathnaver    ORKNEY contained all  Orkney  and  Zetland    The Archbishoprick of GLASGOW which was very extensive contained the Shires of  Clyddesdale Dunbarton Renfrew Air Dumfries Peeblis Selkirk  and  Roxburgh    The Bishoprick of GALLOWAY contained the Shire of  Wigton  and  Stewartry  of  Kirkudbright    The ISLES contained  Arran Bute Cumbra  and almost all the  Hebrides  or  Western Isles    ARGYLL contained all the Shire of  Argyll Lochaber  and some few of the  Isles    The Thirteen PROVINCIAL SYNODS into which  Scotland  is at present divided are  LOTHIAN and TWEEDALE consisting of Seven Presbyteries  viz Edinburgh Linlithgow Biggar Peeblis Dalkeith Haddington  and  Dumbar    MERSE and TIVIOTDALE consisting of Six Presbyteries  viz Dunse Chirnside Kelso Jedburgh Selkirk Ersilton    DUMFRIES consists of Four Presbyteries  viz Middlebee Lochmaban Pentpont  and  Dumfries    GALLOWAY consists of Three Presbyteries  Wigton Stranrawer  and  Kirkudbright    GLASGOW and AIR consist of Seven Presbyteries  viz Air Irvin Paisley Hamilton Lanerk Glasgow Dumbarton    ARGYLL and AIR consist of Seven Presbyteries  viz Denoon Campleton Inverary Kilmoir Sky    PERTH and STIRLING contain Five Presbyteries  viz Dunkeld Perth Dumblane Stirling Auchterarder    FIFE contains Four Presbyteries  viz Dunfermling Kirkalder St Andrews Cowpar    ANGUS and MEARNIS contain Six Presbyteries  viz Meigle Dundee Forfar Breechin Aberbrothock Fordun    ABERDEEN consists of Eight Presbyteries  viz Kincardin Aberdeen Alford Garioch Deer Turreff Fordice Ellon    MURRAY consists of Six Presbyteries  viz Strathbogie Elgin Forres Inverness Abernethy Aberlower    ROSS consists of Four Presbyteries  viz Chanonry Tain Dingwal Dornoch    ORKNEY consists of Three Presbyteries viz  Caithness Orkney Zetland    The Law of  Scotland  has provided against Pluralities and throughout the whole Country there are scarce any Benefices worth less than  l per Annum  Sterling which in that Country is a good Maintenance  XII Of the Order of the  Thistle  or St  Andrew  in  Scotland    THE Order of St  Andrew  or the  Thistle  by reason of its great Antiquity and memorable Institution is upon all Occasions called  The most Antient and most Noble Order of the Thistle  being founded as all the  Scots  Historians assert by  Achaius  the th King of  Scotland  after a signal Victory obtained over the  Saxons Anno  and dedicated to St  Andrew  the Patron or tutelar Saint of  Scotland    This Order came at length to shine forth in fuller Splendor in the Reign of King  James  V who was himself a most splendid and magnificent Prince He caused the Collar of the Order to be composed of two antient Badges or Symbols of the  Scots  and  Picts    viz  The  Thistle  and  Sprigs  of  Rue  but about the Time of the Reformation it fell into Desuetude and was scarcely used by the Knights then being so very zealous for the Reformed Religion that they left their Order where they laid down their Popery and it was never after reassumed till the Reign of King  James  VII who for the better regulating of the Order in all its Proceedings signed a Body of Statutes and appointed the Knights Brethren to wear the Image of St  Andrew  upon a blue watered tabby Ribband and likewise named the Royal Chapel or Abbey Church of  Holyroodhouse  to be the Chapel of the Order the old Church of  St Andrews  being ruined at the Reformation for which End it was put in excellent Repair but was divested of all its beautiful Ornaments by a furious Rabble at the late Revolution  Her late Majesty Queen  Anne  was pleased to revive the said Order upon the st of  December  and signed a Body of Statutes wherein the Colour  of the Ribband was charged from Blue to Green to make a Distinction between this Order and that of the  Garter  all which Statut  s the late King  George  I was pleased to confirm with some additional ones among which was that of adding Rays of Glory to surround the whole Figure of  St Andrew  which hangs at the Collar And tho' from the Time of the Reformation both Elections and Installments had been dispensed with his Majesty was pleased to order that for the future Chapters for Election shall be held in the Royal Presence to which End he commanded the great Wardrobe to provide the Knights Brethren and Officers of the Order with such Mantles as are appointed by the Statutes of the Order  XIII Of the Civil Government of  Scotland    THE  College of Justice  commonly called  The Sessions  consists of a President and Fourteen fix'd Senators or Judges called  Ordinary Lords of Session  and Two Extraordinary Lords and they have Seven Clerks of Session and Six other inferior Officers Before this Court all civil Causes are tried at stated Times And they determine Causes by Acts of Parliament and the Custom of the Nation and where these are defective they determine according to the Imperial and Civil Law not according to the Rigour of the Letter but according to Equity and Justice There lies no Appeal from this Court but to the Parliament and the Presence of Nine Judges is required to make their Decree valid The Parliament has full Power to affirm or reverse with Costs not exceeding  l  Sterling  This Court has distributive Justice only both in Law and Equity but no Authority as to Life or Limb unless for some Faults competent to themselves Since the Union Lords of Session are appointed  a Committee for planting of Churches and Valuation of Tythes    The Justiciary  commonly called  The Justice  or  Criminal Court  consists of Five Lords of the Session and the JusticeGeneral and JusticeClerk They try all Crimes All Prosecutions in this Court are raised by the King's Advocate and the greatest Traitor is here allow'd Advocates to plead for him    The Court of Exchequer  was established in pursuance of the  Act of Union  in the th Year of Queen  Anne  and has the same Power Authority Privilege and Jurisdiction of the Revenue of  Scotland  as the Court of Exchequer in  England  has over the Revenues there The Judges have also the Power of passing Signatures Gifts and Tutories  c  The Court consists of a Chief and Four other Barons and it has Two Remembrancers a Clerk of the Pipe Attorneys Auditors and other Officers  The Officers of State are  The Keeper of the Seal and his Officers  The Lord PrivySeal and his Officers  Lord ClerkRegister and his Officers  Lord Advocate  The  Faculty of Advocates  enjoy many and great Privileges with the rest of the College of Justice and have a Dean a Treasurer Clerk Curator and other Officers  Writers of the Signet  are those who subscribe all Writs and Summons's that pass the Signet and they as well as the Advocates are capable of being made ordinary Lords  Besides the above National Judges every particular County or Shire has a chief Magistrate or his Depute ordinary Judge in all Cases Civil and Criminal but there lies an Appeal from this Magistrate in most Cases to the Session and Court of Justiciary  The  Sheriff  is in effect the supreme Justice of Peace to whom the Law principally intrusts the securing the Quiet and Tranquillity of the Part of the Kingdom of which he is Sheriff King  James  VI and King  Charles  I bought in some and designed to buy in all the rest of these heretable Sheriffalties but most of them yet remain in the great Families of the Kingdom  Bailiffs Stewards and Constables in their respective Districts have the same Liberty as Sheriffs in their Shires  There are Three Sorts of Burghs  viz Burghs Royal Burghs of Regality  and  Burghs of Barony  every one whereof is a Corporation and holds Courts tho' only the Royal Burghs send Members to Parliament  The  Royal Burghs  are one intire Body govern'd by and accountable to one general Court called  The Convention of Burrows  which is annually held generally at  Edinburgh  and have Cognizance of all Matters relating to the Trade and Interest of all the Burghs in general  Regalities  are Fews granted by the King to some particular Subjects whose Authority and Jurisdiction are very large and extensive both in Civil and Criminal Cases and the Lord or his Baillie has not only the Power of  Furca Fossa  Pit and Gallows but a Jurisdiction with the Magistrate  in Civilibus    As to  Burghs of Barony  every one that holds a Barony of the Crown has a Court wherein lesser Causes both Civil and Criminal are tried  c  The  Commissariot Courts  are a kind of Ecclesiastical Courts The Commissaries of  Edinburgh  who are Four particularly try Causes of Matrimony and Adultery in order to a plenary Divorce not only  à thoro mensâ  but even  à vinculo matrimonii  so that the innocent Party may marry as if the offending Party were naturally dead  The  Court of Admiralty  is a supreme Court in all the Causes competent to its own Jurisdiction and the Lord HighAdmiral is the King's Lieutenant and JusticeGeneral upon the Seas and in all Ports Harbours and Creeks of the same and upon fresh Water and navigable Rivers below the first Bridge or within Floodmark And no Appeal lies to the Court of Session for Maritime Matters All Maritime Causes Crimes Faults Trespasses Quarrels  c  are triable before the LordAdmiral's Judge for he himself never judges in Person by the Civil Law and Customs of  Scotland  Nevertheless there are some particular Jurisdictions of Admiralty hereditary in some great Families as the Duke of  Argyll  who is Admiral of the  Western Isles  the Earl of  Sutherland  of the Shire of that Name the Earl of  Morton  of  Orkney  and  Zetland  c And such Men of War as come up the Firth of  Forth  for guarding and securing the Coasts receive Orders from the LordProvost of  Edinburgh    By the th of Queen  Anne  Justices of Peace are established in  Scotland  with the same Authority as those in  England    XIV A short View of the Acts of Parliament of  Great Britain  that have made any Alteration

Shires  c  FROM the foregoing Particulars you will perceive Sir that this Part of the united Kingdom is far from being so inconsiderable a Country as some would have it thought who know nothing of the Matter and give themselves the Licence of making National Reflections an ungenerous Vice to which the  English  are but two much addicted as well with regard to  this  as a  neighbouring Kingdom  and a still nearer  Principality  You will observe that there are but few Things wanting to make  Scotland  as populous and as full of Trade Shipping and Wealth in proportion as most if not the best Counties in  England  Those few Things indeed are very difficult if not impossible to be obtained as Things stand particularly  A Change in the Disposition of the common People from a Desire of Travelling Abroad to an industrious and diligent Application to Labour at Home  Stock and Substance to encourage that Application Sloth is not a Disease of the Nation The  Scots  are as diligent as industrious as apt for Labour and Business and as capable of it when they are Abroad as any People in the World and why should they not be so at Home No doubt they would if they had suitable Encouragement  Some little Alterations in their Method of Husbandry by which their Lands would be improved and the Produce thereof turn to better Account of all which something shall be said in my Progress through the Country as Occasion offers  If Vassalage Servi  and other BasTenures or Holdings of L  l  gally altered and the  Superiors  obliged by Law to sell or accept of a valuable Consideration for their Feuds and Superiorities  This has been in a great measure effected by virtue of the Acts for Disarming the Highlanders  c  See  p      If they were more accustomed to Leases for Years or Lives such Tenants and Leaseholders would be better enabled and encouraged to improve the Ground than otherwise they are or can be  If the Court resided and Parliaments were held sometimes in  Scotland  or near it which would save a great deal of Money now spent in Journeys to  London  and attending a long time there which if Individuals find their Account in is nevertheless a Loss to the Whole  In the mean time I shall endeavour to shew what  Scotland  really is and what it might be if those Engagements were fulfilled which were promised to them before the Union such as erecting Manufactures under  English  Direction embarking Stocks from  England  to carry on Trade employing Hands to cut down their Northern Woods and to bring the Fir Timber and Deals to  England  of which  Scotland  is able to furnish a very great Quantity and lastly encouraging their Fishery  c  But leaving its Manufacturies and Wants to the Consideration of those in whose Power it is to promote  and supply them I shall hasten to conclude this Letter but first shall give you an Account of the present Division of this Part of the united Kingdom into Counties  c  Scotland  then is divided into Shires or Counties and two Stewarties which I shall give as follows in Alphabetical Order tho' from the Nature of my Work I cannot observe that Method in my future Letters  Shires of    Aberdeen    Aire    Argyll    Bamf    Berwick    Bute    Caithness    Clakmannan    Cromarty    Dumbar    Dumfries  with the Stewarty of  Annandale    Edinburgh  or  MidLothian    Elgin    Fife    Forfar  or  Angus    Hadington    Inverness    Kincardin    Kinross    Lanerk    Linlithgow  or  West Lothian    Nairn    Peebles  or  Twedale    Perth    Renfrew    Ross    Roxburgh    Selkirk    Sterling    Sutherland    Wigtown    The Stewarties of  Kirkubright  and  Orkney    And now Sir having premised these general Things which will save me much Repetition in my following Letters I will conclude this with assuring you that I am  Your humble Servant  LETTER II CONTAINING A Description of the  Merse  the Two  Lothians  of  Edinburgh Leith  c  SIR  _I AM just now entered  Scotland  by the ordinary Way of  Berwick  which stands on the North Side of the River  Tweed  and has a Bridge by which it is joined to  Northumberland  It was originally a  Scots  Town and is to this Day no Part of  England  but has divers distinct Customs and Privileges and is mentioned in all Statutes and Proclamations as a Place or Liberty of itself distinct from  England  and  Wales  It was formerly the chief Town of the  Merse  which to this Day is called the Shire of  Berwick  It was often taken from and retaken by the  Scots  but the last time it fell into the  English  Hands which was long before the Union of the Two Crowns in the Person of King  James  VI they fortified it more strongly than it had been formerly and manned it with a sufficient Garison so that all the Attempts of the  Scots  to regain it afterwards proved ineffectual It is a Place of no extraordinary  Trade tho' a great Thoroughfare It has but one Church which is under the Jurisdiction of the Bishop and in the Gift of the Dean and Chapter of  Durham    As soon as we get out of the Town we enter on  Scots  Ground tho' in Times of War it used to be part of what was called  Debateable Land  and on that Account but thinly inhabited for the Borderers of each Kingdom often made Inroads on one another notwithstanding that a great Number of Men at an incredible Trouble and Expence kept Watch every Night besides which there were Watchtowers all along the Borders at proper Distances and several Laws relating to the Borders made by Commissioners from both Kingdoms  The first Thing we observed was the Sea on the Righthand and the River  Tweed  which fetches a Reach Northward on the Left The Land between lies so high that in stormy Weather 'tis very bleak and unpleasant having little or no Shelter However the Land compared to what we left in  Northumberland  or what we soon found farther in  Scotland  is good  The first Town in  Scotland  is  Mordington  a poor sorry Village yet gives the Title of Lord to a Branch of the noble Family of  Douglas  The present Lord lives in  England  and is so well known that I need say no more of him  From the Brow of a very high and steep Hill we had a large View into  Scotland  but we were welcomed to it by such a Gust of Wind that it obliged us to quit our Horses in real Apprehension of being blown off besides the Wind blowing full North and the Road turning toward the same Quarter it blew directly in our Faces I can truly say I never was sensible of so exceeding keen and sharp a Cold for it pierced our very Eyes so that we could scarcely keep them open  When we went down the Hill the first Town we came to is almost as perfectly  Scots  as if you were an hundred Miles North of  Edinburgh  and there is very little Appearance of any thing  English  there either in Customs Habits Usages of the People or in their way of Living Eating or Behaviour And there are very few  English  Familes to be found among them  On the contrary you have in  England  abundance of  Scots  Men  Scots  Customs Words Habits and Usages nay even the Buildings in the Towns and Villages all over  Northumberland  imitate the  Scots  witness their building their Houses with the Stairs going up to the second Story on the Outside of the House that one Family may live below and another above without going in at the same Door which is the  Scots  way of Living as you may see in  Alnwick Wirkworth  and several other Towns witness also their setting their Corn in great Numbers of small Stacks without Doors not making use of Barns but only a particular Building which they call a Barn tho' no more than a Threshingfloor into which they rake one of these small Stacks at a time and thresh it out  The first Town is called  Ayton  from the small River  Ay  on whose Bank it stands The Church was ruinous and quite destitute of a Roof The Heritors being of different Opinions contributed not a little to the Dilapidation Such as were episcopally inclined were very backward in contributing their Share and the Presbyterians thought it hard the Whole should lie upon them so that between the two the Roof fell to the Ground However the Minister preached in a Barn to the Generality of the Parishioners and such as were otherwise inclined heard Episcopal Ministers in the Houses of some of the neighbouring Gentry  About Three Miles farther East is a small Harbour with a Town called  Eymouth Aymouth  or  Haymouth  where a Fort was formerly raised to curb the Garison of  Berwick  This Town gave Title of Baron to the late Duke of  Marlborough  but the Patent being granted only to him and the Heirsmale of his own Body the Honour extinguished with him It is a good Fishingtown and affords a good Harbour for Fishingvessels In Queen  Elizabeth  's Time the  French  held it and fortified it as it was the first Port in  Scotland  they could safely land their Supplies at for the Queenmother but they were obliged to quit that and the Kingdom some time after by a Treaty Queen  Elizabeth  supporting the Reformers against her  From this Bridge we enter upon a most desolate and in Winter frightful Moor for Travellers especially Strangers called  Coldingham Moor  upon which for about Eight Miles you hardly see a Hedge or a Tree and you meet with but one House all the Way and that not a House of Entertainment  Coldingham  whence this Moor derives its Name was an old Monastery built by  Edgar  King of  Scotland  about the Year and famous for its Lady Abbess  Ebba  of whom they tell us the following Story  This Lady was the Daughter of  Edelfred  King of  Northumberland  and when her Father was taken Prisoner by the Pagan  Mercians  she got into a Boat in the  Humber  with three other Women and by their own Prayers only were miraculously preserved and carried as far as  Scotland  where under a Promontory they were driven on Shore by a Storm and their Boat dashed in Pieces  When they got ashore they laboured with their Hands and made themselves a little Hut to lodge in they continued their religious way of Living and the Country People sustained them with Food till at  length acquiring a great Character by their Sanctity and Austerity they were addressed to far and near for their Prayers and by the Charity of the People got enough to build a religious House at  Coldingham    Here as Fame says when the cruel  Danes  came on Shore the religious Lady who it seems was very beautiful too cut off her Nose and upper Lip and made all her Nuns do the same in order to preserve their Chastity Whereupon the barbarous  Danes  enraged at their Zeal fired their Nunnery and burnt them all alive From this Lady who it is said was sainted for these Sufferings the Promontory where she landed is to this Day called  St Ebbe's Head  and vulgarly by our Sailors  St Tabbe's  There was once upon the Point of this Promontory a strong Fort called  Fastcastle  belonging to the Earl of  Hume  but it has been some time demolished  A little to the Northwest is the Town and Castle of  Duns  remarkable for the Birth of  John Duns Scotus Anno  some of whose Family are still in Being there He was a Frier Minor and the greatest Scholar of his Age  Scaliger  says there was nothing his Genius was not capable of But his chief Study was in Points more nice than necessary whereupon he was called  Doctor Subtilis  His Followers called  Scotists  were great Opposers of the  Thomists  another Set of Scholasticks so named from  Thomas Aquinas  He studied at  Oxford  and  Paris  and died of an Apoplexy at  Cologn  After  Berwick  was taken by the  English  the SheriffCourt was kept here which was but lately removed to a Markettown called  Greenlow  which is also a Royal Burgh and the principal in the Shire belonging to the Earl of  Marchmont    Duns  was also remarkable for the Encampment of the  Scotish  Army under General  Lesley  assembled to oppose King  Charles  I when he came to the  English  Borders with an Army to  persuade  that Kingdom to Obedience It has the best weekly Market for Cattle in  Scotland  and is a Place of the best Trade in this County  Coldstream  is also a Markettown in this County of  Merse  where was antiently an Abbey  Eccles  likewise had another and  Ersilton  is noted for the Birthplace of the Rhyming Poet  Lermouth  so much admired by the Vulgar  Scots Hume  was formerly the Residence of the Earls of that Name which they derived from the Town and they had a strong Castle there now demolish'd  The inconsiderate Vanity of the ancient  Scotish  Gentry and Nobility of deriving their Names from the Places of their Residence had this Inconvenience attending it that in a few Generations it lost the old Name of the Family from which these  Changelings  may I without Affront call them descended Thus the  Dunbars  and  Humes  originally the same came to be thought two distinct ones In like manner the  Gordons Swintons Ridpaths Nisbets  and the  Spotswoods  as some say tho' all of the same Original must have lost the Knowledge of it had it not been for Tradition or the Armorial Bearings of the several Families which bespeak them to be of the same Lineage This Hint may serve once for all as to those Families called of  that Ilk    i e  whose Surname and paternal Estate are the same and are generally esteemed ancient and honourable  The County of  Merse  or  March  formerly gave Title of Earls of  March  to the Family of  Dunbar  who according to  Camden  derived their Origin from the famous  Gospatrick  Earl of  Northumberland  who retired into  Scotland  on the  Norman  Conquest and was honoured with the Earldom of  March  and Castle of  Dunbar  by the then King  Malcolm Canmore  whence his Posterity took the Name while another Branch being possessed of the Barony of  Hume  assumed that for their Surname which they still retain  George de Dunbar  being proscribed in the Reign of  James  I of  Scotland  the Title of Earl of  March  was conferred on the Duke of  Albany  then on the Family of  Stewart  and  Lenox  which being extinct King  William  III conferred it on  William Douglas  Brother of the Duke of  Queensbury  whose Son now enjoys it  Having passed over  Coldingham Moor  called also  Lambermoor  the Lowlands of  EastLothian  shew themselves from the Top of a steep Hill and give a Prospect of a fruitful and pleasant Country As soon as we come down the Hill there is a Village called  Cockburnspath  or  Cobberspath  where Nature forms a very steep and difficult Pass and where a thousand Men well armed and boldly doing their Duty could keep out a very great Army if there was occasion for it  The next Shire is that of  EastLothian  and the first House of any Note we met with in it was that of  Dunglass  the Seat of Sir  James Hall  We began here to see that  Scotland  was not naturally so barren as some People represent it but might be made equal even to the richest most fruitful most pleasant and best improved Part of  England  if the  Scots  had the same Methods of doing it and were as good Husbandmen as the  English  and this might easily be brought to pass would the Gentry set about it as this Gentleman has in part already done  The Truth is the Soil hereabout is very good and the Seaware as they call the Weeds which the Sea casts up abundantly supplies the Defect of Marl Chalk or Limestone for by laying this continually on the Land they plough every Year without letting it lie fallow as we do and I found they had as much Corn as our Ploughmen express it as could stand upon the Ground  The next Town of Note is  Dunbar  a Royal Burgh which in  Scotland  is much the same with what we call a Corporation in  England  and sends Members to Parliament in like manner only in  Scotland  these Burghs have some particular Privileges separate to themselves as that for Example of holding a Sort of Parliament called a  Convention of Burghs  a Method taken from the Union of the  Hans Towns  in the North in which they meet and concert Measures for the publick Good of the Towns and of their Trade and make Bylaws or Acts and Declarations which bind the whole Body Not have they lost this Privilege by the Union with  England  but it is preserved entire and is now many ways more advantageous to them than it was before as their Trade is like to be in time more considerable But this I have taken notice of in another Place  This Town of  Dunbar  is a handsome wellbuilt Town situated in the Mouth of the River  Forth  on the Southside towards the  German  Ocean It is a very considerable Port and of great Advantage to all Ships in the River in case of Stress of Weather but yet its Entrance was so difficult by steep Rocks in the Mouth of the Harbour that the Corporation had exhausted itself by endeavouring to cut through them and being unable to proceed further in it and at the same time the Townhouse and School of the Town being run to Decay and the Town itself destitute of fresh Water To answer all these good Purposes they procured an Act to pass in the Year intituled  An Act for laying a Duty of  Pennies  Scots  or one    th Part of a Penny upon every Pint of Ale or Beer that shall be sold within the Town of  Dunbar  for improving and preserving the Harbour and repairing the Townhouse and building a School and other publick Buildings there and for supplying the said Town with fresh Water    This Duty has been of very great Service to the Town and has enabled them to make a great Progress in the intended Improvements but the principal Works which were to dig up Part of a Rock at the Bottom of the Harbour to carry out the great Pier to the Rock called  The Beacon Rock  to cut the Slope of the Island down to a Perpendicular and to supply the Town with fresh Water remaining undone and the Act expiring in the Year the same was continued for Years longer by an Act passed  Geo  II which will it is hoped perfect all that remains undone  They had here a great Herringfishery which has decayed very much of late Years and they cure Herrings here as they do at  Yarmouth  in  Norfolk  tho' I can't say they cure them so well nor are they so fit for keeping and sending on long Voyages The Herrings themselves may indeed make a little Difference being generally larger and fatter than those of  Yarmouth  which makes it more difficult to cure them so as to keep in a hot Climate and on a long Voyage Here was formerly a strong Castle which was demolish'd by Act of Parliament during the Minority of King  James  VI  Between the Town and the great Road stands a little but pleasant and agreeable Seat of the Duke of  Roxburgh  called  Broxmouth  with a Park well planted in Vista's and Walks for the Gentlemen of  Scotland  are now set upon planting Foresttrees as well for Ornament as Profit And here I would give an useful Hint to the Gentlemen who plant Trees in  Scotland  the Want of which as I have observed at several great Houses and Parks in that Country is the Reason they do not thrive as they might otherwise do And this is by securing the young Trees by a triangular Frame seven or eight Feet high which is made by setting three large Stakes about them in an equilateral Triangle and  Tree and all with Haybands to defend the Bark fasten'd together at the Top Then as the Tree stands in the Centre of the Triangle which way soever the Wind blows the Root is not shaken or the Earth moved and loosened about it  For want of this the Tree being left without Support before it has taken Root the Winds shake it every way and loosen the Earth about it so that it gets no Time to strike This is the Reason why in many of the Gentlemens Parks I saw the Trees stunted and balked though they had been planted many Years  On the Southwest Side of this Town under the Mountains near a Place called  Dunhill  is the Field where the Battle of  Dunbar  was fought between  Oliver Cromwell  and General  Lesly  Commander of the  Scots  Army where the desperate Few for  Cromwell  's Army was not above Men defeated and totally overthrew the great Army of the other Side killed of them and took Prisoners to the Surprize of the World  Here we turned out of the Way to see the Marquis of  Tweedale  's fine Park at  Yester  or  Zester  in the Centre of which stands a very noble House but in a too low Situation  The old Earl of  Tweedale  in the Reign of King  Charles  II having seen the Plans of  Greenwich  and  St James  's Parks was so pleased with them that as soon as he went down into  Scotland  he laid out the Plan and Design of all those noble Walks and Forests of Trees which he planted here A Gentleman whose Judgment I can depend upon told me that if ever those Trees came to be worth but Sixpence apiece they would be of more Value than the Fee Simple of the whole paternal Estate of the Family Nor is this unlikely if it be true that his Lordship and his immediate Successor planted above Acres of Land with Firtrees and whereever any  of them failed they were constantly renewed the next Year  The Park itself is said to be eight Miles round and exceeds in many respects the new Park at  Richmond  in  Surrey  But the Plantation of Fir is not confined to this Estate for the Family has another Seat at  Pinkey  near  Musselburgh  where the same Lord planted also a great Number of Trees as his Successors have likewise done at another Seat which they have in  Fife  near  Aberdour    As this Planting is a great Encouragement to the Nobility of  Scotland  to improve their Estates by the same Method so we find abundance of Gentlemen follow the Example insomuch that you hardly see a House of Note especially in the South Parts of this Country but is adorned with Groves and Walks of Firtrees about it by which we may reasonably expect that in a little time  Scotland  will have no need to send to  Norway  for Timber and Deal but will have sufficient of her own and perhaps be able to furnish  England  too with considerable Quantities  From this Town of  Dunbar  to  Edinburgh  the Country may be reckoned as fruitful pleasant and rich as any in  Scotland  or indeed as most in  England  The Sea is on the Righthand at a moderate Distance and the Hills on the Left farther off which are habitable and feed large Flocks of Sheep and have many open Roads leading over them from  Edinburgh  and other Parts towards  England    The most material Thing this Country wants is more inclosed Pastures by which the Farmers would be enabled to keep a sufficient Stock of Cattle well foddered in the Winter and thereby not only be furnished with Store of Butter Cheese and Beef for the Market but likewise by the Dung of the Beasts  nrich their Soil according to the unanswerable  Maxim in grasing That Stock upon Land improves Land  Two other Articles would increase and enrich them which they seldom or never practise  Folding their Sheep within moveable Hurdles  Fallowing their ploughed Land  The first would fatten the Ground and the latter destroy the Weeds which would be of great Service to the Land at a Distance from the Sea where they have not the Benefit of Seaweed which I have just now mentioned  But at present for want of Inclosures they have no Winter Provision for black Cattle and therefore the Farmers have no Dairies no Butter or Cheese in any Quantity and no Heaps of Dung in their Yards to return upon the Land for its Improvement Thus a good Soil is impoverished for want of Husbandry  From  Dunbar  we pass another River  Tyne  which to distinguish it from the two  Tynes  in  Northumberland  I shall call  Scots Tyne  tho' not so distinguished here It rises in the Hills near  Yester  and watering part of the fine and pleasant Vale I mentioned before runs by  Haddingtoun  a Royal Burgh and an old halfruined Town with the Remains of an old Nunnery It was formerly large handsome and wellbuilt and reckoned very strong for besides the Walls of Stone which were in those Times esteemed very good the  English  fortified it with Lines and Bastions four of which latter were very large as may be seen by what remains of them to this Day It had also a large Ditch and was so strong that the  English  commanded by Sir  George Wilford  defended it against a great Army of  French  and  Scots  tho' his Garison were almost all swept away by the Plague till he was relieved from  England  when he quitted it after demolishing the Fortifications  They have a good Stonebridge here over the  Tyne  tho' the River is but small The Church was large but has suffered in the Ruin of the rest and but part of it is repaired tho' big enough for the Number of Inhabitants There are in it some Monuments remaining of the Duke of  Lauderdale  and other  Maitlands  ancient Lords of this Part of the Country but as the Choir of the Church is open and defaced they have suffered with the rest  In and about this Place I saw something of a Manufacture and a Face of Industry which was the first I had hitherto seen the least Appearance of in  Scotland  particularly here was a Woollen Manufacture erected by a Company or Corporation for making Broadcloth which they call  English  Cloth And as they had  English  Workmen and  English  Wool they really made it very good but I cannot say they could bring it so cheap to the Market as they do in  England  This was the Reason that tho' before the late Union the  English  Cloth being prohibited upon severe Penalties their own Cloth supplied them very well yet as soon as the Union was made by which the  English  Trade was opened the Clothiers from  Worcester Gloucester Wilts Somerset  and  Devonshire  brought in their Goods and underselling the  Scots  those Manufacturies were not able to stand it However the People turn their Hands to other Things are still employed in Spinning Dying Weaving  c  and carry on a good deal of that Sort of Business  On the Northside of the Mouth of the  Forth  stand the Remains of  Tantallon  Castle infamous in the  Scots  History for being the Seat of Rebellion in the Reign of King  James  V Hence came the odd Fancy among the Soldiers That the Drums beating the  Scots  March which was invented by the King's Soldiers when they marched against the Earl of  Angus  who held out this Castle against him say  Ding down Tantallon  But it is now no more a Fortress being intirely demolished  Overagainst this in the Mouth of the same River stands a steep Rock called the  Bass  inaccessible on all Sides except by one narrow Passage It was formerly slightly fortified rather to prevent its being made a Retreat for Pirates and Thieves than for any Use it could be of to command the Sea for the Entrance of the  Forth  is so wide that Ships can go in and out without the least Danger of being hurt by any thing that could be offered from the  Bass    In the Times of the late King  Charles  II and his Brother King  James  VII it was made a StatePrison where the Western People called in those Days  Cameronians  were confined for being in Arms against the King And after the Revolution a desperate Crew of People got Possession of it and having a large Boat which they hoisted up upon the Rock or let down at Pleasure committed several Piracies took a great many Vessels and held out the last of any Place in  Great Britain  for King  James  But their Boat being at last either seized or lost and not being seasonably supplied with Provisions from  France  as they used to be they were obliged to surrender  The  Solan  Geese are the principal Inhabitants of this Island a Fowl rare as to its Kind for they are not found anywhere in  Britain  that I can learn except here in some of the lesser Islands in the  Orcades  and in the Island of  Ailzye  in the Mouth of the  Clyde  They come as certainly at their Season as the Swallows or Woodcocks with this Difference if what the People there tell us may be depended on that they generally come exactly to the very same Day of the Month  They feed mostly on Herrings and therefore 'tis observed they come just before or with them and go away with them likewise tho' 'tis evident they do not follow them for they go all away to the  North but whither is not known As they live on Fish so they eat like Fish which together with their being so exceeding fat makes them in my Opinion a very coarse Dish rank illrelished and soon gorges the Stomach But here they are look'd upon as a Dainty  It is a large Fowl rather bigger than an ordinary Goose 'Tis webfooted but its Bill is pointed like a Crane or Heron only much thicker and not above five Inches long When they are coming they send some before to fix their Mansion which for that Reason are called  Scouts  The Inhabitants are careful not to disturb them till they have built their Nests and then they are not to be frightened by any Noise whatsoever They lay but one Egg at a time which they so dextrously fix by one End to a Point of the Rock in the middle of the Nest that if it be pulled off 'tis difficult to fix it so any more They hatch it by holding it fast under one Foot and seldom leave it till it be hatched The Fish caught by the old ones often serve the Inhabitants for Food and the Sticks they bring to make their Nests supply them with Fewel They make great Profit both of the Flesh and Feathers of their young ones which are taken from their Nests by one let down the Rock with a Rope When young they are of an ash Colour but when old white  At the Top of the Rock is a freshwater Spring with a small Warren for Rabbets but the Bottom of it is almost worn through by the Tide It was formerly the Possession and sometimes the Seat of the antient Family of  Lawder  who a long time refused to sell it tho' often solicited to it by several Kings King  James  VI told the then Laird  He would give him whatever he pleased to ask for it  whereby that Gentleman had a fine Opportunity of making a good Bargain But after he had told his Majesty That he would sell it upon these Terms and the King desiring  to know what he would ask he answered  Your Majesty must e'en resign it to me for I'll have the ald Craig    i e  Rock  back again  However the Family at last coming to Decay it was purchased by King  Charles  II  From hence keeping the Shore of the  Forth  due West we find a Range of large and populous Villages all along the Coast almost as far as  Leith    All this Part of the Country is delightfully spread with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen as the Duke of  Roxburgh  's near  Dunbar  the Earl of  Haddington  's at  Tinningham  the Lord  Beilhaven  's at  Beilhaven  and that of the Family of  Dalrymple  Earl of  Stair  who have fine Seats at the Burgh of  North Berwick  where there is a small but pretty good Market  Hales  and in the Neighbourhood of this Place  The House and Estate of  Dirleton  now in the Family of  Nisbet  is pleasantly seated in this Part of the Country as is  Ormistoun  a thriving little Town belonging to the Family of  Cockburn  round which they have a handsome Estate so well planted and improved that I don't remember to have ever seen a more beautiful Spot of Ground They have also a pretty good Seat here but when I saw it it was very much out of Repair  I must here add the antient and noble Houses of  Seton  and  Winton  both Palaces for so they deserve to be called of the late Earl of  Winton  who did so many weak and rash Things in the Affair of the late Rebellion They are now in a State of Ruin as is the Estate on which they stand which for its Value is as fine as any in  Scotland  lying all contiguous with itself and valued at almost  l Sterling per Annum  but all being under Forfeiture it was sold to the  YorkBuildings  Company The fine Gates and Stone Wall were demolished by the Government after it had been made a Garison by the  Highlanders who from hence began their harebrain'd March to  England  which Expedition ended at  Preston  The Name  Seton  was given the Family from the Term  Seton  which one of the Ancestors of it used to the Soldiers he commanded when entering upon an Engagement They were reckoned a very gallant as well as loyal Family and no true  Scotsman  can well omit telling the memorable Story That in the Year when  Edward  II came before  Berwick  where Sir  Alexander Seton  was then Governor he summoned him to surrender and threatened to hang his two Sons whom he had among his Hostages if he delayed Accordingly a Gallows was erected near the Town Wall and the young Men led forth Tenderness for his Children began to move the Governor when his Lady of the Name of  Cheyne  came and told him  He and she were both young enough to have more Children but if he surrendered he could never recover his Honour  Upon this he refused and the Tyrant cruelly murdered the young Gentlemen but the Lady was rewarded with Two Sons afterwards  The Towns upon this Coast as I said stand very thick and there are two or three Articles of Trade which render them more populous and more considerable than they would otherwise be  There are great Quantities of white Fish taken and cured all along this Coast and I observed that they were very well cured merchantable and fit for Exportation  There is great Plenty of Coal in the Hills so near the Sea that the Carriage is easy a great deal of which is carried to  Edinburgh  and other Towns thereabouts  They make very good Salt at almost all the Towns upon the Shore as at  Seton Cockenny Prestonpans  and several other Places They have a  very great Trade for this Salt to  Norway Hamburgh Bremen  the  Baltick  and even  Holland  and the Number of Ships loaded with it here yearly is very considerable  They take great Quantities of Oysters here also with which they not only supply the City of  Edinburgh  but carry abundance of them in large open Boats called  Cobles  as far as  Newcastle upon Tyne  from whence they generally bring back Glass Bottles  At several of these Villages are little Moles and Harbours or Peers built up at a considerable Expence for securing the Ships that come to load Salt and other Goods as at  North Berwick Aberlady Preston Prestonpans  which is also noted for good Malt Liquor  Cockenny Portseton  c  The Country hereabouts is both pleasant and populous and full of Gentlemens Houses among which is  Salton  belonging to Mr  Fletcher    We came next to  Musselburgh  an antient  Burgh of Regality  In this Town are many Hands employed in the Woollen Manufacture especially in coarse Stuffs for the Use of the Poor and they have continued many Years successfully this Branch of Trade without any Rival  A little West from this lies  Fisherraw  so called from a very large Row of Houses mostly inhabited by Fishermen who were formerly more numerous here than at present for the Muscle Trade which was of old reckoned very valuable is now given over and their chief Business at present consists in catching Cods Haddocks Whitings and some few Shellfish  More to the South are two small Villages called  Newbigging  and  Goodspeedall  but they are so nearly joined to  Musselburgh  and  Fisherraw  that a  Stranger would take them to be all one continued Town Nevertheless they have not had a Church since the Reformation but are only a Part of the Parish of  Inveresk  an adjoining Village so called because it stands on the River  Esk  which tho' it be sometimes so full of Water as to overflow its Banks yet being rapid it is not made navigable  This Village enjoys so good an Air that the eminent Dr  Pitcairn  called it the  Montpelier  of  Scotland  It is very full of People and there are several very handsome Houses and Gardens in it which invite the Citizens of  Edinburgh  to take Lodgings here in the Summer as the  Londoners  do at  Kensingtongravelpits Hampstead Hackney  and  Highgate    But the Glory and Beauty of this Parish is  Pinkey  which formerly belonged to  Seton  Earl of  Dumfermline  but now to the Marquis of  Tweedale  who usually resided here before his House at  Yester  was finished which tho' it be the most magnificent Building yet is not so agreeably situated as  Pinkey  which stands near the Sea just as we enter into  Musselburgh    In the Court before the House is a large Stone Well covered with an Imperial Crown of Stone supported by Pillars of the  Ionick Order  The great Hall on the Right as you enter is adorned with Views of the great Cities of  Italy  and in a Drawingroom adjoining to it is a Billiardtable The great Staircase on the Left is balustraded with Iron and crowded with Pictures  The first Apartment consists of a Diningroom Drawingroom and Bedchamber all very spacious curiously wainscotted with Oak and hung with the Seasons in Tapestry of the small Figures and best Sort The Bed is of crimson Velvet in an Alcove neatly supported with Pillars The Chimneys are of Marble and above that of the Diningroom  is painted the finest Inside of a Church that is anywhere to be seen  The great Gallery is very long and spacious the Ceiling whereof is full of  Latin  Inscriptions suitable to the several Paintings Here is a Family Picture of the Lord  Seton  with his Four Sons and Daughters by  Hans Holbein  Mr  Henderson  the Covenanter by  Vandyke  the whole Length of King  Charles  I and his Chancellor the Earl of  Dumfermline  in his Robes by the same Hand The first Earl of  Tweedale  with his Eight Sons and Seven Daughters all in one Picture as big as the Life takes up almost one End of the Room There are fine Altarpieces Passionpieces and others of that Kind that were saved from Plunder out of Monasteries at the Reformation Here is likewise a good Picture of the Earl of  Strafford  and another of the Duke of  Lauderdale  who married his only Child to the Heir of this Family with great Numbers of Family Pictures of the  Hays  and  Setons  There is also well preserved the genealogical Tree of the Family from the Year to this Time  viz  the  Hays Giffards  and  Frazers  But many of the Pictures have been of late carried to  Yester    The Parterre behind the House is very large and nobly adorned with Evergreens and on each Side of it spacious Gardens The Whole stands in a Park above three Miles in Circumference well planted with an incredible Number of Firtrees and walled round with Stone I confess if I had been Owner of  Pinkey  I should hardly have built  Yester  for  Pinkey  stands nobly and has a commanding Prospect not only over the adjacent Country but also of the Coast of  Fife  over the Sea at nine Miles Distance Whereas  Yester  as I have said lies in a Bottom and all its Views bounded within itself  Yester  'tis true is the antient Seat of the Family whose Title to  Pinkey  is but late and some say was precarious  Near this Place was fought a Battle by  Edward Seymour  Duke of  Somerset  when he came to force the  Scots  into the Marriage of their young Queen  Mary  with his Nephew King  Edward  VI which was bytheby a very coarse way of Wooing Here was a great Slaughter of the  Scots  But tho' the  English  won the Battle yet they lost their Prize for the young Queen was privately embarked carried to  France  and afterwards married to the Dauphin who became King  Francis  II  The  English  call this the Battle of  Musselburgh  but some  Scots  Gentlemen riding out with us to shew us the Place where the Action was begun and ended we all agreed that the  Scots  are in the right who call it the Battle of  Pinkey    I now approached the capital City of  Edinburgh  but must say a Word or two of its Situation before I enter it Standing then at a small Distance and taking a View of it from the East you have really but a very confused Idea of the City because the Situation being in Length from East to West and the Breadth illproportioned to it you view it under the greatest Disadvantage possible whereas if you turn a little to the Righthand towards  Leith  you have a very handsome Prospect of it and from the South you see it to yet more Advantage because it is increased on that Side with new Streets  At the Extremity of the Eastend of the City stands the Palace of  Holyroodhouse  leaving which a little to the Left you come thro' a populous Suburb to the Entrance called the  Waterport  From hence turning West the Street goes on in a strait Line thro' the whole City to the Castle It is above a Mile in Length and is perhaps the largest longest and finest Street for Buildings and Number of Inhabitants in the World  From the Palace Door which stands on a Level with the lowest of the plain Country the Street  begins to ascend very gradually being nowhere steep but this Ascent being continued for so long a Way it is easy to understand that the further Part must necessarily be very high for the Castle which stands as it were at the Extremity West as the Palace does East makes on all the three Sides that only excepted which joins it to the City a frightful and impassable Precipice  Together with this continued Ascent you are to suppose the Edge or Top of the Ascent so narrow that the Street and the Row of Houses on each Side take up the whole Breadth so that which way soever you turn you go down Hill immediately which is so steep that it is very troublesome to those who have not very good Lungs to walk in those Sidelanes which they call  Wynds  By this Description you will perceive that the City stands upon the narrow Ridge of a long ascending Mountain  On the Northside of the City towards the Westend of it where the Castle stands is a Lough or Lake of Water which has a small Brook that runs thro' it so that it cannot be said to be quite standing There was formerly another Lake on the Southside of it which being now filled up is built into a Street tho' so much lower than the high Street that as I said before the Lanes between them are very steep  The Town is so antient that no History has recorded when by whom or on what Occasion it was built yet it seems most natural to conclude that such a Situation could not be chosen but for a Retreat from the Outrages and Attempts of the  Britons Saxons Danes  or other Enemies for having an impregnable Castle at the Westend and a Lake on either Side the Inhabitants had nothing to defend but the Entrance at the Eastend which it was easy to fortify  If this was not the Reason for chusing the Situation what should have hindered them from building the City in a pleasant delightful Valley with the Sea flowing up to one Side and a River running thro' the Middle of it such as that Space of Ground between it and the Sea where the Town of  Leith  stands There they would have had a noble pleasant and most useful Situation a very fine Harbour for their Trade a good Road in the  Firth  for their Ships of Burden a pleasant River which with small Art and Charge might have been so drawn round the City as to have filled its Ditches and made its Fortifications almost impregnable as the  French  did when they fortified  Leith  Or had they gone to the Southside of the City and extended it towards  Libertoun  and  Goodtrees  they had found a Plain large enough to have contained another  London  watered on the Southpart with a pleasant Brook capable by the Help of Pipes to have conveyed Water into every Street and House  These Things they did not foresee or not understand in those Days but regarding immediate Safety fixed on the Hill as a sure Strength formed by Nature ready at their Hand By this means the City lies under such Inconveniencies as are made a Subject of Scorn and Reproach by some as if the People delighted in Stench and Nastiness whereas were any other People to live under the same Unhappiness of a rocky and mountainous Situation a Throng of Buildings from six to ten Stories high a Difficulty of obtaining Water that little they have being to be carried up to the uppermost Apartments we should find a  London  or a  Bristol  as dirty as  Edinburgh  and perhaps less able to make their Dwelling tolerable at least in so narrow a Compass for tho' many Cities have more People in them yet I believe there is none in the World where so many People live in so little Room  On the Northside of the City as I have said is a spacious rich and pleasant Plain extending from the Lake which joins it to the River of  Leith  at the Mouth of which is the Town of  Leith  at the Distance of a long  Scots  Mile Here were not the Northside of the Hill which the City stands on so exceeding steep that it is not only impassable for Carriages but can hardly be clambered up on Foot and were the Lake filled up as that on the other Side is the City might have been extended upon the Plain below and fine Streets would no doubt have been built Nay I question much whether in time the high Streets would not have been forsaken and the City as I may say run all out of its Gates to the North  This might have been the Consequence if the City had been in a State of Increase for had their Trade flourished as was reasonably expected if the Business of  Darien  had succeeded or upon the Union the Inhabitants would have likewise increased  Having thus considered the City in its outward Appearance and in its Situation I must look next into its Inside where we shall find it notwithstanding all its Discouragements and Disadvantages a large populous noble rich and even Royal City The main Street as above is the most spacious and best inhabited in  Europe  The Buildings are surprising for their Strength their Beauty and their Height and are mostly of Freestone yet so firm that tho' they stand so high and in a Country where Storms and violent Winds are so frequent 'tis very rare and only on such Occasions as I shall mention byandby that any Damage is done here  From the Palacegate Westward this Street is called the  Canongate  as belonging to the Canons of the Abbey which is a kind of Suburb by itself as  Southwark  is to  London  In this Part of the Street tho' otherwise not so well inhabited as the City itself  are several very magnificent Houses of the Nobility built for their Residence when the Court was here Of these the Duke of  Queensbury  's the Earl of  Winton  's the Duke of  Roxburgh  's the Earl of  Panmure  's and the Earl of  Murray  's are the chief The first and last are very large and princely Buildings all of Freestone large in Front and have good Gardens behind them  At the Upper or Westend of this Street where it joins to the City is a Gate which like  Ludgate  parts the City from the Suburb but does not discontinue the Street which rather widens and is more spacious when you are thro' the Gate than before This is the famous  Netherbow Port  whose Doors were like to have been taken away by the Parliament when the Affair of Captain  Porteous  was under their Consideration as I shall mention more particularly byandby  Just at this Gate on the Outside are two Streets one of which is called  St Mary Wynd  and the other  Leith Wynd  the first leads out of the City South into the great Road for  England  by the Way of  Kelso  and at the Foot of it is a Gate turning Westward into the low Street called the  Cowgate  because the Cattle are driven thro' it to and from the great Marketplace The other leads North into a Suburb called the  Calton  from whence there is a very handsome Gravelwalk Feet broad continued to the Town of  Leith  which is kept in Repair at the publick Charge and no Horses suffered to come upon it  We now enter the City at the  Netherbow Port  and have an open View up the high Street It must not be expected I should describe all the Buildings of the City I shall therefore touch upon some few and go on The first of any Note is a fine House on the Southside of the Street a little within the Gate belonging to the Marquis of  Tweedale  with a  Plantation of Limetrees behind it the Place not allowing Room for a large Garden Adjoining to this are very good Buildings which if set out in handsome Streets would adorn a very noble City but being crouded together in narrow Wynds and Alleys deserve no Notice  A little further on the same Side is the  Trone  Kirk and near it in the Middle of the Street stands the Guardhouse where two Companies of disciplined Men cloathed and armed like Grenadiers at the Charge of the Town do Duty every Night and keep the publick Peace of the City  About Midway between the  Netherbow  and the Castle is the great Church which before the Reformation was Collegiate and dedicated to  St Gyles  but it was afterwards divided into several Preachingplaces and Districts of the City were allotted to them so as to be parochial When King  Charles  I erected a new Bishoprick at  Edinburgh  which before that time was in the Diocese of  St Andrews  it was made a Cathedral and the Dean was Forenoon Minister of that Part of it called the  New Kirk  which is the Choir Chancel or Eastern Part In it is a noble Gallery for the King or his Commissioner Here also the Magistrates assemble and the Judges in their Habits in time of Session In a large Chapel on the Southwest Part of this Church the General Assembly hold their Sessions as does also the Commission of the Assembly in the Interval between the General Meetings  The great Cross under the Tower is called the  Old Kirk  and the Front or Westpart of the great Church is divided into two Parts That on the South is called the  Tolbooth Kirk  and that on the North  Haddo's Hole  from the Laird of  Haddo  Grandfather to the present Earl of  Aberdeen  who being a great Royalist and Anticovenanter was kept Prisoner in a Vault there till he was beheaded  The Steeple in the Middle is very high and of good Architecture the Summit of it resembles an Imperial Crown Here they have a Set of Bells which are not rung out as in  England  for that way of Ringing is not known in this Country but are played upon by the Hand with Keys like a Harpsichord the Person playing having great Leather Covers to his Fists by which he is able to strike with the more Force They play all manner of Tunes very musically and the Town gives a Man a yearly Salary for playing upon them from half an Hour after Eleven till half an Hour after Twelve every Day  Sundays  and  Holidays  excepted  On the Southside of this Church formerly the Churchyard is a Square of very fine Buildings called the  Parliament Close  the West and Southsides of which are mostly taken up with the Parliamenthouse the several Courts of Justice the Councilchamber the Exchequer the publick Registers the Court for the Royal Boroughs to assemble in the Lawyers Library the Post Office  c  The great Church makes up the Northside of the Square and the East and Part of the Southside is built into private Dwellings very stately lofty and strong being seven Stories high to the Front of the Square and the Hill they stand on having a very steep Descent some of them are no less than fourteen Stories high backwards In the middle of this Square is an Equestrian Statue of King  Charles  II which is reckoned the finest of its kind in  Europe    The Parliamenthouse is a stately convenient and large Structure Over its Entrance are the Arms of  Scotland  well cut with  Mercy  and  Truth  on each Side for Supporters and this Inscription  Stant his felicia regna  importing that these Virtues make Kingdoms happy And under the Arms was this Motto  Unio Unionum  relating not only to the Union of the two Crowns but signifying that  their Advice was necessary for the Maintenance of it The Room for meeting of the Parliament had on that Occasion a high Throne for the Sovereign or the Commissioner with Benches on each Side for the Nobility and Bishops and Forms conveniently placed in the Middle for the Commoners Without the Area was a Pulpit for Sermons to the Parliament on particular Occasions and behind the Pulpit a large Partition for others besides Members to hear the Sermons and Debates of the House when they thought fit to allow it This Building in some measure resembles  Westminsterhall  and tho' not quite so large has a much more curious Roof In the South or Upperend one of the ordinary Judges sits every Week in Sessiontime to hear Causes in the first Instance But when the Parliament sat that Court was removed to another Part of the Hall At the Westend of it are kept the Sheriff and Commissary Courts Near the Northend is the Town Councilhouse or  Guildhall  and over it is the Justciary or Criminal Court At the Southeast Part of the Parliamenthouse is a Door from what they call the  Outerhouse  where the Lord Ordinary sits into the  Inner  where sit the other Fourteen Judges or Lords of Session which is the supreme Civil Judicature of  Scotland  Over which are Apartments for the Lords of Exchequer and for the Privycouncil when in Being  In the Lowerpart under the Parliamenthouse is a noble Library of Books and MSS belonging to the College of Justice or Gentlemen of the Law  Near the Councilchamber stands the Royal Exchange made up of a double Row of Shops and another Exchange inferior to this  The great Opening into the high Street being the only Passage into it for Coaches is at the Northeast Corner a little from which is the Marketcross where all their Proclamations and publick Acts are  read and published by Heralds and Sound of Trumpet Here is the great Parade where Gentlemen meet for Business or News as at the Exchange every Day from Eleven to One  Near the Westend of the great Church stands the  Tolbooth  or common Prison as well for Criminals as for Debtors It was formerly the Place of Residence for the Provost of  St Gyles's  as most of the adjacent Houses were for the Canons and Choiristers of that Church  The great Church and this Prison both standing in the middle of the Street the Breadth and Beauty of it is for some Space interrupted but those Buildings past the Street opens again to its former Breadth and is now called the  Lawnmarket  from the  Linenmarket  being kept here This Part of the Street extends West to a narrower one which leads to the  Castlehill  At the Upperend of it is a Stone Building appropriated to several publick Offices of lesser Value called the  Weighhouse  for below Stairs are Warehouses with publick Weights and Scales for weighing heavy Goods  Here the high Street parts into two one of which leads to the Castle Hill as already noticed and the other turns Southwest and descending gradually leads to the  Grassmarket  a Place very like  Smithfield  in every respect where is kept a weekly Market for Black Cattle Sheep Horses  c  This Street which is called the  Westbow  is inhabited mostly by wholesale Dealers in Iron Pitch Tar Oil Hemp Flax Linseed Drugs Woads and suchlike heavy Goods  This City hath seven Gates or Ports as they are here called  viz  The  Netherbow Port  This is the chief Gate it was magnificently built in and adorn'd with Towers on both Sides This is the Entrance from the  Palace and the principal Suburb called the  Canongate    The  Cowgate Port  at the Eastend likewise gives Entrance to the Street of that Name leading to the Abbey by a Backway  The  Potterrow Port  gives Entrance to the Suburb so called and leads to  Dalkeith Kelso  c Southward  The  Society Port  called so from the Society of Brewers who have a great square Court near it with stately Houses and Buildings round it  The  West Port  the only Gate at the Westend of the City which leads thro' a large Suburb to  Glasgow Sterling Queensferry  and from thence to the West and North Highlands  The  New Port  at the Eastend of the Lake leading Northward towards a Village called  Mouter's Hill  and  Leith    The  CollegeKirk Port  leading also to  Leith    The Markets here are very well supplied with all the Necessaries of Life and are mostly kept in distinct Marketplaces walled in and reserved for the particular Things they are appointed for such as  The Meal Market  The Flesh Market  The Poultry Market  The Fish Market  The Corn Market  The Leather Market  Besides these there is a Weekly Market for all Sorts of Woollen Manufactures and Linen Cloth kept in that Part of the high Street called the  Lawn Market  just now mentioned There is also in the same Street below the Cross an Herb and Fruit Market kept every Morning but abates before Noon so that it is no Incumbrance The Market for Black Cattle Sheep Horses and Grass is kept in that  large Space of Ground within the  West Port  called the  Grass Market  as I have already mentioned  On the Southside of the City towards the Eastend stands a large Building erected at the Charge of the Surgeons and Apothecaries of this City in which is their great Hall hung round with the Pictures of all the Surgeons of this Place that have been since this Building was founded Here they have also a Theatre for Dissections and a Chamber of Rarities in which there are several Skeletons of uncommon Creatures a Mummy and other Curiosities  Near the  Potterrow Port  stands the College or University It consists of three Courts two lower and one higher equal to the other two These Courts are encompassed with neat Buildings for the Use of such Students as please to lodge in them for they don't live in common nor are they obliged to reside but only to attend their Classes at certain Hours There is a high Tower over the great Gate looking to the City  The  Publick Schools  are large and commodious there are Accommodations for Students handsome Dwellings for the Professors and fine Gardens for their Recreation It was founded in by King  James  VI upon a Petition from the City to grant them a Charter with the Privilege of an University but the Foundation was not perfected till The Persons established by the Foundation were a Principal or Primate a Professor of Divinity four Regents or Masters of Philosophy and a Professor of Philology called  Prof Humaniorum Literarum  or Regent of Humanity In the Town added a Professor of Mathematicks To which have been lately added Professors of Ecclesiastical History Civil Law Theoretical and Practical Medicine Chymistry  c  The Dignity of Chancellor  and Vicechancellor of the University is in the LordProvost and Town Council  They have a very good Library which was founded by  Clement Little  one of the Commissaries of  Edinburgh  since which it is much increased by Donations from the Citizens Persons of Quality and others who had their Education there The Library is neatly kept well furnished with Books put in very good Order cloister'd with Wire Doors which none but the Keeper can open which is more commodious and less encumbering than Multitudes of Chains commonly used in other Libraries The Books given by the grand Benefactors are kept in distinct Apartments and the Donor's Name over them in Letters of Gold  Over the Books hang the Pictures of several Princes and of the most eminent Reformers at Home and Abroad and near them is kept the Skull of the famous  Buchanan  very intire and so thin that the Light may be seen thro' it It was deposited there by Mr  Adamson  formerly Principal of the University who procured it to be taken out of his Grave and fastened some  Latin  Verses to it in Commendation of that celebrated Historian There is also the Original of the  Bohemian  Protest against the Council of  Constance  for burning  John Hus  and  Jerom  of  Prague Anno  with Seals of  Bohemian  and  Moravian  Grandees annexed to it It was procured by a  Scots  Gentleman in his Travels and given to the University  Under the Library was the King's Printinghouse for Bibles  c  At the farther End of the Library is a Staircase which leads to the higher and lower Common Halls where they hold their Commencements and College Entertainmenrs In this Place are several Maps Globes Books and Rarities and among others a crooked Horn cut out of a Woman's Head when fifty Years old and who lived twelve  Years after it It is several Inches long and was taken out of her Head by a Surgeon  Anno  Here also are Lectures read Exercises performed and Apartments for the Professor of Divinity to teach his Pupils in and for a select Library proper for Divines  In this higher Common Hall which is a very spacious Room are placed such Books as have been bought by or given to the College since the Library below was full and in the Southend of it is a curious and noble Museum collected by the very eminent Sir  Andrew Balfour  who was once Tutor to the famous Earl of  Rochester  It contains a vast Treasure of Curiosities of Art and Nature domestick and foreign from almost all Parts of the World and is greatly valued by the Virtuoso's containing some Rarities that are not to be found either in those of the  Royal Society  at  London  or the  Ashmolean  at  Oxford  Sir  Robert Sibbald  having a mind to engraft his Name and Merit on that of the celebrated  Balfour  made a Present of a great Number of Shells and other Curiosities to the College on Condition the Magistrates would print the Account of it called  Auctarium Musei Balfouriani e Museo Sibbaldiano  to which I refer the Reader  Eastward from the College is the HighSchool well endow'd and with proper Apartments for one Master and four Ushers who teach Youth Grammar and Rhetorick  In  Gray'sclose  near the  Cowgate Port  is the Minthouse in a large Court with neat and convenient Buildings and other Accommodations for the Master Officers and Workmen It is now disused for that Purpose and is a Sanctuary or Place of Privilege  At a small Distance from the College are two neat Hospitals with pretty Gardens to each of them and a little further is the Churchyard of the  Franciscans  or  Gr  yfriars  the common Burialplace for the  whole City within the Walls where are a great many fine and curious Monuments It contains about two Acres of Ground  Adjoining to it is  Heriot's Hospital  a large and stately Building the most magnificent of its Kind in the World adorned with a consecrated Chapel large Walks delightful Greens and pleasant Gardens It was built by the Rev Dr  Balcanqual  to whom  George Heriot  Jeweller to King  James  VI left near Pounds to be disposed of in pious Uses which that worthy Dean did by building and endowing this House and giving Statutes to it which he ordered should be  unalterable  'Tis a Nursery for an indefinite Number of the Sons of Freemen who are maintained cloathed and educated in useful Learning till they are fit for Apprenticeships or to go to the University where they are allowed handsome Salaries and Exhibitions  On the Southside of the City in the way to  Leith  is a beautiful Collegiate Church built by Queen  Mary  of  Guelders  Queen to King  James  II and dedicated to the  Holy Trinity  but now Parochial tho' nothing but the Church Part was ever finished  Near it is  St Thomas's Hospital  wherein old decayed Citizens and their Widows are very decently provided for and allowed a Chaplain  Overagainst it is  Bridewell  or the House of Correction in which dissolute People undergo Discipline and are kept to hard Labour There is an Apartment in it for lunatick and distracted Persons  Of late Years Mrs  Hare  left a noble Benefaction for a new Hospital for Female Orphans of decay'd Freemen which created a laudable Emulation in many others whose united Contributions have raised another for the same good Purpose  An Infirmary called the  Royal Infirmary  after the Example of those at  London Winchester  c has been lately erected at  Edinburgh  by the liberal  Contribution of many welldisposed Persons and there was so general a Goodwill to the Work that the like Spirit has hardly ever been known anywhere The Proprietors of several StoneQuarries made Presents of Stone to it others of Lime Merchants contributed Timber The Wrights and Masons were not wanting in their Contributions The neighbouring Farmers agreed to carry Materials  gratis  The Journeymen Masons contributed their Labour for a certain Quantity of hewn Stones and as this Undertaking is for the Relief of the diseased lame and maimed Poor even the Daylabourers would not be exempted but conditioned to work a Day in a Month  gratis  to the Erection The Ladies too contributed in their own way to it for they appointed an Assembly for the Benefit of the Work and it being wellattended every one contributed bountifully to it It has met with no small Encouragement from the Nobility and Gentry and his Majesty was pleased to give  l  towards it So that it is really a noble Work and is now in a flourishing Condition The following is the Inscription on the first Stone  The Royal Infirmary at  Edinburgh  Founded  Aug  Earl  Cromarty  G M  Another necessary Charity was setting on foot as a Correspondent writes me word in a Letter dated  Edinburgh July  and it is to be hoped will be attended with the desired Success The following is an Abstract of the Letter  "Amongst the several pious and commendable Designs which have of late Years been form'd for the Relief of the Helpless and Forlorn Pity it  that one Case as claimant as any  viz  the INCURABLES has hitherto escaped publick No  Th  se poor Creatures have in common  with the others abovemention'd every thing that can move Sympathy being equally destitute of Health Subsistence and Care but with this one distinguishing Aggravation of their Calamity that they are  without Hope  which is the finishing Stroke of Distress and changes Misfortune into Misery When the Learned in Physick and Surgery have pronounced their Diseases  desperate  and  irremediable  and when upon that Account they have been  set out  of the  Infirmary  or  refused Admittance into it  as being without Compass of the Power of Medicine or Skill of the Physician to recover them many of them have no Houses of their own where they may languish out the tedious Remains of a comfortless Life so that if they do not soon die in the  Streets  or  Fields  they must wander to Places where they can have neither  Ministers  nor  Physicians  to bring them that Assistance and those  Softenings  which may make unavoidable Death more easy and happy to them  "The Consideration of this moving Case being suggested at a late Meeting of some Persons in  Edinburgh  they touch'd with Compassion of their FellowCreatures in such dismal Circumstances and thankful for the Goodness of God to themselves in preserving them from such Distress judged it worthy of Attention and propos'd to raise by Subscription a Fund for this charitable Use to be under the Guardianship and Administration of the Governors of the  OrphanHospital  at  Edinburgh  "  What will be done in this Case I cannot judge but my Friend has set it forth with so much honest Warmth and good Sense that nothing need be added to it to shew the Necessity of so excellent a Design  The Physicians were incorporated in by King  Charles  II and have their College near the  Netherbow  in the  Fountainclose  They are deservedly esteemed learned and able and give not place to the Physicians of any Country The late Dr  Pitcairn  has left behind him ample Testimonies of his Skill in Nature and Medicine and bore a Character that no Man of his Time abroad or at home eclipsed  On the Northside of the City is an excellent Physickgarden containing some thousands of Exotick Plants and Simples The late learned and industrious Mr  James Sutherland  its then Intendant published an Account of it in under the Title of  Hortus Medicus Edinburgensis  They are all disposed into the most rational Method according to that of the learned Dr  Morison  the late  Oxford  Botanist a Native of  Scotland    The City is govern'd by a LordProvost whose Office is much the same as that of the Lord Mayor of  London  four Bailiffs who besides the Power of Aldermen in the Government of this City have that of Sheriffs and a common Council ordinarily consisting of twentyfive Persons but extraordinarily of thirtyeight All these are chosen annually and the Provost Dean of Guild and Treasurer are to be Merchants or if any Tradesman be chosen he must quit his Trade and not return to it without Leave of the Magistrates and TownCouncil and he must also be a Year or two a Member of the common Council No one is to continue in the Council above two Years at a time except he be a Member of it by virtue of a superior Office The Bailiffs are to be chosen indifferently out of twelve Candidates proposed and none is to be elected Deacon of any of the fourteen incorporated Trades except he has been Master of his Trade two Years at least and  must not continue Deacon above two Years at a time The fourteen incorporated Trades are  Chirurgeons  Goldsmiths  Skinners  Farriers  Hammermen  Wrights  Masons  Taylors  Bakers  Butchers  Cordwainers  Weavers  Wakers  i e  Fullers  Bonnetmakers  The Magistrates are chosen annually upon the  Tuesday  next after  Michaelmasday  by thirtyeight Electors whereof twenty are to be Merchants and Tradesmen who are to chuse such as in their Conscience they think best qualify'd and these Magistrates and the TownCouncil have the Administration of the Government except in some reserved Cases as the Election of Magistrates Dean of Guild and Treasurer and setting of Fews or Leases giving Boundaries and Places and other publick Matters in which Cases they are to consult the fourteen Deacons of Trades  None of the Merchants or Traders are to have any particular Conventions or make any Bylaws among themselves without Consent of the Magistrates and TownCouncil except to chuse their own Deacons at the appointed Time to make Persons free of their Trade or to try their Work and one of the Commissioners for Parliament was always to be chosen out of the Tradesmen and another out of the Merchants The Auditors of Accounts are to be chosen out of an equal Number of both The LordProvost Dean of Guild and Treasurer are not to continue longer than two Years at a time and the Bailiff must be one Year a Bailiff one Year old Bailiff and one Year free of Office Before the Union the  LordProvost for the Time being was always one of the Privy Council  The Trained Bands of the City consist of sixteen Companies besides which they have a standing Company of Town Guards  And here it will be proper to take notice of the notorious Riot committed in this City on the th of  Sept  in relation to Capt  Porteous  which made so much Noise and brought down upon this famous City the Resentment of the Legislature of  Great Britain    The Case was this One  Andrew Wilson  was condemned for a Robbery of the publick Money committed on the Highway and on  Wednesday  the th of  April  the Day appointed for his Execution the Magistrates being apprehensive that a Rescue would be attempted ordered Capt  John Porteous  at the Head of a Detachment of the City Guard to attend the Execution and Powder and Ball were delivered to them for that Purpose That while  Wilson  was hanging the Populace insisting he should be cut down before the usual Time and being refused attempted to do it by Force and meeting Opposition from the Captain and his Guard they outrageously pelted them with Stones and hurt several of the Detachment That hereupon the Captain order'd them as he was accus'd but which he deny'd to fire and upon the Mob continuing their Insults and the Captain's Men firing over their Heads to intimidate them the Captain order'd them to level their Pieces and fired himself both which however he deny'd and by that means six Persons were mortally wounded and fourteen others very desperately maimed and hurt That hereupon the Captain was brought to his Tryal and on a very solemn Hearing was found guilty of firing a Gun himself and ordering his Men to fire and so was condemn'd to be hang'd upon a Gibbet on the  th of  Sept  The Captain drew up a Petition to her late Majesty then Regent of the Kingdom in the Absence of the King and insisted on his Innocency praying for Mercy and great Application having been made to her Majesty for changing the Sentence to Transportation a Reprieve for six Weeks was granted Which arriving on the d of  September  at  Edinburgh  occasion'd the most extraordinary Riot that ever was known or heard of all Circumstances considered except that at  York  against the  Jews  mentioned in its Place  For on the th of  September  the Night before the Captain was to be executed had he not been reprieved about ten at Night some Men by Surprize enter'd the City seized all the Firearms Battleaxes and Drums belonging to the City Guard  The Mob hereupon in a few Minutes lock'd and secur'd all the City Gates and with Drums beating an Alarm attempted with Hammers and other Instruments to force open the  Tolbooth  Prisondoor But failing they desperately set Fire to it and burnt it When they entered the Prison they made the Underkeeper open the double Locks of the Apartment where the Captain was He begg'd in vain to be spared till the Afternoon and making some Resistance they dragg'd him down Stairs by his Legs and hurried him away This was about eleven at Night and they march'd out with Lights before them In their Way to the  Grassmarket  passing by a Barber's Signpost some called out to hang him up there but it was resolved to hang him where the Murders for which he was condemn'd were committed So they proceeded to the Place where on Executions the Gallows used to be fixed where they kept him above a Quarter of an Hour till they open'd a Shop and brought out a Rope one End of which they threw over a Signpost about Feet high He desir'd some Time to  prepare for Death but was answer'd They would allow him no more than those had who were shot They then pull'd him up in the Dress in which they found him  viz  a Nightgown and Cap His Hands not being ty'd he fix'd them betwixt his Neck and the Rope whereupon one with a Battleax struck at his Hands They then let him down and he having on two Shirts they wrapt one of them about his Face and ty'd his Arms with his Nightgown and then pull'd him up again where he hung next Morning till Daylight when he was cut down and carried to the  Greyfryars  Church Upon inspecting his Body it appear'd his Leftshoulder was wounded his Back discolour'd and his Neck broke He deny'd his giving Orders to fire with his last Breath  It was observ'd that this Mob was under a stricter Concert and better Conduct than usual for marching along to the Execution the unhappy Man observing a Gentleman of his Acquaintance he gave him a Purse of twentythree Guineas which he desir'd might be deliver'd to his Brother which they offer'd not to obstruct They left indeed the Prisondoors open whereby several Prisoners escaped but after they had perpetrated the unprecedented Fact they left the Arms and Drums at the Place of Execution where they were found next Morning Moreover during the Tumult Parties of armed Men with Drums patrolled in the different Streets to prevent any Surprize from the King's Forces quarter'd in the Suburbs The Magistrates attended with several of the Burgesses attempted as was said to disperse the Mob but were pelted with Stones and threaten'd with Firearms if they did not retire After the Execution was over they went to the LordProvost's House and telling him they were satisfy'd departed without offering any other Violence Nay it was said that to do the Act  with more Decency having no Clergyman they order'd two of the gravest among them to exhort the unhappy Man as they carry'd him to Execution  The Boldness Secrecy and Conduct of this Enterprize was the most extraordinary Instance of its kind that ever was known and the Keeper declaring that tho' the Persons who first enter'd and demanded the Keys wore Leather Aprons but were otherwise well dress'd it made some imagine that Persons above the vulgar Rank had a hand in it  Be this as it would the Insult on the Sovereign Authority was too flagrant to be overlook'd Proclamations with Rewards of  l  Sterling were issued for apprehending the Rioters and when the Parliament met vigorous Measures were taken in the Affair The LordProvost was order'd up to  London  in Custody the Magistrates were order'd up also to attend the House of Lords at  London  and finally an Act of Parliament was passed to disable  Alexander Wilson    Esq  from holding or enjoying any Office of Magistracy in  Edinburgh  or  Great Britain  a new Provost was injoin'd to be chosen and a Fine of Two thousand Pounds levied upon the City of  Edinburgh  for the Use of the Widow of Captain  Porteous  as Punishments for their respective Remissnesses in not endeavouring to prevent this Insult on Sovereignty and all lawful Authority  This Act however passed not without great Debates and as some thought it impossible to prevent a Design so well concerted and so suddenly and boldly executed they were of Opinion that the City of  Edinburgh  was treated with too much Severity But after all it could not be expected but that the Legislature should shew the highest Indignation against so insolent a Riot  This Act was passed in the th Year of his Majesty and in the same Session was also passed another  for the more effectual bringing to Justice any Persons concern'd in this strange Attempt in which Fugitives not surrendering were made liable to Death The concealing of those who should be declared Fugitives was also made Death This Act was to be read before Morning Sermon in every Church of  Scotland  every  Sunday  for a Year Impeachers were to be encouraged and discharged Informers rewarded with  l  Sterling for every Person they should convict and be admitted Witnesses  But so secretly was this dark Affair managed that I don't remember any body has suffer'd on the Account and the reading of the Act was but indifferently digested by many in that Kingdom  Greater Severity was intended such as the imprisoning as well as disqualifying the LordProvost for a Year for abolishing the TownGuard of the City of  Edinburgh  and for taking away the Gates of the  Netherbow  Port and keeping open the same But the City of  Edinburgh  was happily saved from this Disgrace  It is now Time to return to our Subject  The Churches in this populous City and Suburbs are Twelve including the Chapel of the Castle The Ministers about Twenty besides Three Chapels  The Twelve Churches are  The Canongate Kirk  The Collegiate or College Kirk  The Trone Kirk or Christ's Kirk  All these are Parts of the Cathedral of  St Gyles  's  The New Kirk  The Old Kirk  The Tolbooth Kirk  Haddo's Hole Kirk  The Lady  Yester  's Kirk  The Greyfriers Kirk now divided into two  The West Kirk or  St Cuthbert  's  The Chapel of the Castle  There are also about twenty Meetinghouses of the Episcopal Party for tho' Presbytery be the established Religion of  Scotland  since the Revolution yet a great Number of the People of all Ranks are not of that Opinion especially in the Nothern Parts  The Churches are always very full for the People in this Country do not wander about on the Sabbathdays as in  England  They have also one very good Custom as to their Behaviour in Church which I wish was practised in  England  If any Person comes in after Divine Service is begun he takes no Notice of any body nor any body of him whereas we make our Bows and Cringes even in the Middle of our Prayers Not that the  Scots  want Manners for they shew them more properly after the Sermon is done and the Blessing given when they all look round upon their Friends especially to Persons of Distinction and make their Civilities as courteously as we do  The City is encompassed with a kind of  Roman  Wall on every Side except the North where it is secur'd by a Lake  The Castle only and the Palace remain to be mentioned The first is strong both by Situation and Art but far from being impregnable as has been experienced more than once It was formerly called the  Maiden  Castle because the  Pictish  Kings kept their Daughters in it Still more antiently it was called  Alatum Castrum  or the  Winged Castle  perhaps from its Form and standing on so high a Hill as it were in the Air It is situated at the Westend of the City as we have said where the Rock rises to a high and large Summit 'Tis inaccessible on the South West and North The Entrance is from the Town where the Rock is also very high and is defended by a round Battery and an Outwork at the Foot of it In the Castle is a Royal Palace of hewn Stone where are kept the Regalia  and chief Records of State as also the Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation  A Chapel is also in it for the Use of the Garison and it is furnished with Water by two Wells in the Rock From the Castle is a delightful Prospect over the City and neighbouring Country and to the River of  Forth  from whence it is saluted by such Men of War as come to anchor in  Leith  Road The Governor is always a Person of prime Quality and General of the Forces  The Governor LieutenantGovernor FortMajor and some other Officers have very good Apartments and there are deep Vaults in the Rock which they say are Bombproof  The Palace called  Holyroodhouse  is a very handsome Building rather convenient than large The Entrance is majestick and over the Gate is a large Apartment which the Duke of  Hamilton  claims as Hereditary Keeper of the Palace Within this is a large irregular Court where are Coachhouses and Stables which I think are very improperly placed here for if they had stood farther off either in the Park or without the Outgate and a Barrack or Guardhouse like the HorseGuards at  Whitehall  built in their Stead it would have been much more becoming a Royal Palace  This may be called the  Escurial  of  Scotland  being both a Royal Palace and an Abbey founded by King  David  I for Canons Regular of St  Austin  who named it  Holyroodhouse  The Entrance from the great outer Court already described is adorned with Pillars of hewn Stone under a Cupola in the Form of an Imperial Crown balustraded on each Side atop The Forepart has two Wings on each of which are two Turrets that towards the North was built by King  James  V whose Name it bears in Letters of Gold and that towards the South as well as all the rest by King  Charles  II whereof Sir  William Bruce  was Architect The inner Court is very stately all of Freestone well hewed with Piazzas round it from which there are Entries into the several Apartments truly royal and magnificent but above all the Long Gallery is very remarkable being adorned with the Pictures of all the  Scots  Kings from  Fergus  I to  James  VII inclusive by masterly Hands Those Kings that were eminent and all the Race of  Stuarts  are in full Length the others are but Busto's  You turn to the Right to the Royal Apartments as at  St James  's and the Staircase and Guardroom run exactly as there but far more lofty and magnificent Duke  Hamilton  's Apartment as Hereditary Keeper is in the double Tower to the North and the great Council Chamber in the Tower to the South The Earl of  Perth  when Chancellor in the late King  James  's Reign converted this noble Room into a Popish Chapel and his Apartment behind it was the Jesuits School which being demolished by the Mob at the Revolution has been neglected ever since The Chimneypieces are all of Marble and the Apartments two Pair of Stairs for the Officers of State are very well kept being lent to many of the Nobility who now live in them  Behind this Palace the Conventual Church makes a Wing to the North and Eastward from it is  St Anne'syard  which was designed to be branched out into Gravelwalks adorned with Statues but the Revolution coming on attended with a long and expensive War and afterwards the Union with  England  prevented its being put in Execution  The Church is very high to the Roof and the Pillars are as exquisite as those of  St George  's Chapel at  Windsor  It is an antient very reverend but declining Fabrick and used only as a Burialplace for Persons of Quality In it King  James  VI was  crowned by Bishop  Hepburn  assisted by  John Knox  as was King  Charles  I by Archbishop  Spotswood    King  James  VII began to erect a magnificent Throne here for the Sovereign and twelve Stalls for the twelve Knights Companions of the most noble and antient Order of St  Andrew  or  the Thistle  which he had revived after a long Disuse The finest Carvers and other Masters in  Europe  were employed in it But at the Revolution the Rabble demolished all and ransacking every Corner fell upon a Vault quite built up so as not to be known what it certainly was in which were found the Bodies of King  James  V and  Magdalene  of  Valois  his first Queen together with Lord  Darnley  's all embalmed and preserved in Pickle whereby the Malice of  Buchanan  and others to blacken Queen  Mary  's Memory was discovered for she gave him a Royal Funeral suitable to his high Dignity and did not carry him by Porters privately to a common Burialplace as that Author had asserted  The adjoining Park is about four Miles in Circumference but which is very odd there is neither Deer nor Tree in it and tho' it be very mountainous affords good Pasture for Cattle There is a very high and craggy Rock in it near half a Mile to the Top called  Arthur  's  Seat  from  Arthur  the  British  King who they say used to view the adjacent Country from thence  This Palace or Abbey and Park is Sanctuary for Debtors and no one but by the King's Order only can arrest any Man who has entered his Name in an Office kept there for that Purpose  It may not be amiss to observe that according to several Acts of Parliament divers great publick Works have been undertaken and mostly brought to Perfection for the Benefit of the City of  Edinburgh  and Town of  Leith  and their Vicinities within these few Years past by Benefit partly of the easy  Scotish  Tax of Twopence  Scots  on every  Scots  Pint of Ale and Beer sold in the said City And partly of the Discontinuance of what they called the  PettyportCustoms  there some of which Works are as follow  The Magistrates have at a great Expence collected the Springs and renew'd the Pipes which convey Water to the Town rebuilt the Fountains in the Highstreet inlarged the Harbour of  Leith  and deepened its Chanel have built several hundred Feet of Key there in a very sufficient manner have built two new Churches have paved at a great Expence with Causeystone the whole Highstreets and Ways leading to their City have made a good Highway from  Edinburgh  to  Leith  have built a large Workhouse for the Poor to be employed in Manufacture and endow'd the same with  l per Annum  Also have settled Salaries on the Law Professor at  Edinburgh  and Stipends on the Ministers of the two new Churches have rebuilt the City Walls and taken Measures for paying their old Debts as well as those incurred on account of the Rebellion in  They further proposed also by means of this Fund to narrow the noxious Lake on the Northside of the City commonly called the  North Loch  into a Canal of running Water to erect a Street of Communication to the Fields on the Northside of the City to build a proper Hall for the Court of Justiciary and an Edifice for the publick Records to establish a Salary to a Professor of Civil History and  Greek  and  Roman  Antiquities another to a Professor of  Scots  Law and other publickspirited Purposes And all this is provided for and established by an Act which passed  George  I  Anno  confirming and continuing a  Scotish  Act of Parliament and an Act of  George  I to which Act of  George  I we refer the Reader  I shall just stop to mention an odd Circumstance that was of fatal Consequence to the poor Dogs about  Edinburgh  and  Leith  in the Month of  April  A mad Bullbitch having bitten many Dogs in the  Fleshmarket  to prevent the bad Consequences that might follow the Magistrates of  Edinburgh  issued a Proclamation ordering all the Dogs in that Incorporation to be forthwith put to Death under Penalty of  l  Sterling and Imprisonment to the Owners for twelve Calendar Months and to prohibit all Persons from keeping Dogs for thirty Days from that Time And the Magistrates of  Leith  joining in the Order nothing was to be seen for several Days but chasing hacking slashing hanging and drowning of Dogs and great Lamentations were heard from divers for the Loss of their favourite Puppies for with such Zeal was this Order executed that the Ladies had enough to do to preserve any of their Lapdogs and as it was many Gentlemen got rid by it of formidable Rivals  I shall also take notice here of the Mischiefs done by a terrible Storm which happen'd  Jan  in this City and the adjacent Parts of the like of which we have hardly any Example The Wind began to blow pretty hard between Eleven and Twelve the preceding Night and before One it rose to a complete Hurricane and continued with surprising Fury till Four in the Morning  As the Houses in  Edinburgh  are built high they suffered considerable Damage The Leads which cover'd the stately Building in the  ParliamentClose  were carried off the Roofs some of them more than forty Feet in Dimensions The  Canongate  Church suffered exceedingly and the fine Portico there was almost demolish'd The Consternation was heighten'd by the Alarm of the FireDrum for the Brewery at the Eastend of the Meadow belonging to one Mr  Bryson  taking Fire the Wind increased  the Flame insomuch that the Waterworks proved so many useless Machines so that the Brewery and House were consumed and some low Houses at a considerable Distance catching the Flame were likewise reduced to Ashes Nor was the Fire confined to that Quarter for near the  Canonmills  on the opposite Part of the Town a Farmhouse belonging to one Mrs  Angus  likewise took Fire which consum'd it together with the Cornstacks and Outhouses These Fires happen'd not thro' any Negligence but were intirely occasion'd by the Impetuosity of the Wind which having got Entrance to the Houses scatter'd the Fire and set it in a Glow A large new House at the Back of the  Canongate  consisting of five Stories was intirely beaten down This was the more remarkable as it had been twice destroy'd before and the Owner had built it so strongly that she promis'd herself Security against any Accidents of that kind The Buildings in the Castle were prodigiously damaged their fine Lead Coverings were carried off and thrown upon the Rocks the Magazine was almost demolish'd and other considerable Damages done The Houses at the  Multrieshill  which lay much exposed were almost all unroofed and the new Playhouse was quite uncover'd  This violent Tempest confined not itself to this City At  Leith  it produced likewise very dismal Effects several Houses were damaged and the End of one struck down the Leadmill was uncover'd several of the Ships in the Harbour broke loose and with such Violence that they carried along with them the great Iron Rings to which they were fasten'd  The Shire of  Aire  produced no less dismal Accounts at  Irvine  it blew so hard that many of the Ships suffer'd much and many of the Buildings in the Town were thrown down At  Aire  the Loss was much greater a general Havock was made among  the Houses and Shipping most of which suffer'd and the  Anne  Galley bound for  Jamaica  drove on Shore and was dash'd to Pieces but the Crew were happily saved  The like dismal Account they gave from the  Merse  where the Storm occasion'd a terrible Destruction few Houses being left undestroy'd and several Churches blown down and Numbers smothered in the Ruins and a general Havock made among the Sheep and Cattle  This Storm did very great Damage in other Parts of the Island in  South  as well as  North Britain  but the Effects of it at  Edinburgh  were so terribly remarkable that we thought the above Particulars would not be amiss to insert here  Now we are on the Subject of melancholy Accidents the Reader will excuse me for the following Account of a very deplorable one which happen'd at  Kirkaldy Jan    It is a wellknown Custom that in these Parts the first  Monday  of the Year is always observed with uncommon Gaiety and Mirth and in Consequence becomes a Holyday to Apprentices and Servants fourteen of which belonging to  Pathhead  a little Village adjacent to  Kirkaldy  having got a little Money went to divert themselves with a common Amusement among Boys by throwing up  Thistles or Crowns  The Place they chose was a Cave or a large Hollow below a rocky Eminence As they were thus innocently amusing themselves the Rock tumbled down and crush'd them topieces 'Tis scarce possible to form an Idea of the ghastly Sight which their mangled Bodies exhibited Parents could not distinguish the Corpses of their own Children The Parts of some who were close together when the Rock fell were so mingled that there was no Distinction and the Carnage was the most dismal that could be imagined One escap'd by his being at a  greater Distance from the Rock but his Leg was broke in a vast Number of Places This fatal Catastrophe caused an extraordinary Grief especially as some Parents lost two others all their Children  The following odd Accident happen'd at  Edinburgh  in  September  A Soldier belonging to the Regiment in the  Canongate  went to the King's Park on a Sheepstealing Expedition where he unluckily happen'd to engage with a large headstrong Ram near one of the Precipices at  Arthur  's  Seat  mention'd above which push'd him headlong from the Top of the Rock so that they both fell down together and had their Necks broken The unhappy Fellow was found next Morning with a Handful of the Ram's Wool clench'd in his Fist  We next visited  Leith  the Seaport of  Edinburgh  which is a large and populous Town or rather two Towns for the River or Harbour parts them but they are joined by a stately Stonebridge to which Ships of Burden may come and at Highwater lay their Sides close to the Shore  Here is a very fine Quay well wharfed up with Stone and fenced with Piles able to discharge much more Business than the Place can supply tho' the Trade is far from being inconsiderable At the Mouth of the Harbour is a very long and wellbuilt Pier or Head which runs out beyond the Land a great way and defends the Entrance into the Harbour from being filled up with Sand as it would otherwise be when the Wind blows hard at Northeast There are also Ranges of Piles or Breakwaters as the Seamen call them on the other Side of the Harbour all which are kept in good Repair and by this means the Harbour is preserved and kept open in spite of a flat Shore and a large Swell of the Sea  On the other Side of the Bridge are the Remains of a strong Castle built by  Oliver Cromwell  to command  the Port which is not yet so far demolished but that a little Expence would soon restore it Here the late Rebel Highlanders made a bold Stop and took Possession of it for one Night but not finding their Friends in the City in any Condition to join them and the Troops preparing to attack them they quitted it in the Night and marched off to the Earl of  Winton  's House as I have already related  This Town was once very strong for the  French  held it for some Years against the Reformers but were at last driven out by an Army which Queen  Elizabeth  sent from  England  to assist the Protestants It is under the Jurisdiction of the Magistrates of  Edinburgh  and is govern'd by a Bailiff under them  At  Leith  the Firth is seven Miles over and holds that Breadth for five or six Miles but is narrower a little beyond  Cramond  and at  Queen'sferry  is reduced to two Miles in Breadth This Place is a very good Town as well as Ferry and a Corporation or Royal Burgh Near the Water of  Leith  is a good Copper Mine  At  Cramond  just mention'd and in the Lands of  Inglestown  as well as at other Places in this County  Roman  Antiquities have been found particularly near the former Place were dug up two Stones late in Sir  Robert Sibbald  's Yard at  Edinburgh  upon one of which is a Laurel Crown and on the other a  Roman Securis  they are supposed to have been Part of a Pillar erected in  Domitian  's Time when  Agricola  was in these Parts Near this Place in the Beginning of  December  a Whale between and Feet in Length and in Depth was cast on Shore whose Mate afterwards tumbling about above the Ferry was heard to make a hideous Moan as is supposed for its Loss  Between  Edinburgh  and this Town the Country is thronged with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen  among which the Marquis of  Annandale  has a very pretty one with a fine Garden inclosed with a Brick Wall a thing hardly to be seen anywhere else in  Scotland  the want of which is the Reason why the Wallfruit does not thrive so well as it would otherwise do for the Stone does not hold the Warmth of the Sun after it is gone as the Bricks do  But the Beauty of this Part of the Country is  Hopton  House built upon a delightful Plain on the Bank of the River It was originally a Square but there are two Wings lately joined to it which add greatly to the Beauty of the Building The Situation is so extremely good and gives so elegant a Prospect as well to the Sea as to the Land that nothing can be finer It is exquisitely finished both within and without and there are some Pieces of curious Painting in it besides a great Number of Family Pictures The Stables and Ridingplace are by far the finest and most magnificent in  Scotland  and his Lordship who delights in good Horses has the best without Comparison in all the Country  Hawthornden  also is celebrated for its Caves hewn out of the Rock and  Roslin  for a great stately Chapel  From hence the Firth widens again and soon after is three or four Miles wide and makes a safe and deep Road with good Anchorground where if there was a Trade to answer it a thousand Sail of Ships of any Burden might safely ride  On the Southshore upon a narrow Point of Land running into the Water stands  Blackness  Castle wherein Stateprisoners were confined in former Times especially such as were taken up for religious Differences many of whom miserably perished here either by the Unhealthiness of the Place Want of Conveniencies or something worse This Castle might be of Use if the Harbour was frequented but  as it is not there seems to be no Occasion for it at present  Farther West is  Borrowstounness  a long Town consisting only of one Street which is extended along the Shore close to the Water It has been and still is a Town of the greatest Trade to  Holland  and  France  of any in  Scotland  except  Leith  but it suffers very much of late by the  Dutch  Trade being carried on so much by way of  England  However if the  Glasgow  Merchants would settle a Trade to  Holland  and  Hamburgh  in the Firth by bringing their foreign Goods by Land to  Alloway  and exporting them from thence as they proposed some Time ago 'tis very likely the  Borrowstounness  Men would come into Business again for as they have the most Shipping so they are the best Seamen in the Firth and are very good Pilots for the Coast of  Holland  the  Baltick  and the Coast of  Norway    But it is time to put an End to this Letter which I do by assuring you that I am Sir  Your most humble Servant  LETTER III CONTAINING A Description of the following Shires and Towns viz  Annan Dumfries Galloway Aire Renfrew Glasgow Stirling Linlithgow Clidsdale Tweedale Roxborough  c  SIR  _AS I entered the Eastside of  Scotland  at  Berwick upon Tweed  and have carried on my Account through the  Lothians  so having travelled over the West Part at another Journey when I went from  England  by a different Road I shall here give you the Particulars of that also  Passing the River  Esk  or as it is commonly called the  Solway Firth  beyond  Carlisle  we entered  Scotland  on the Side of  Dumfriesshire  The Division of this County into  Eskdale Nithsdale  and  Annandale  is but the ordinary marking out the Rivers  Esk Annan  and  Nith  as I observed of the Rivers  Teesdale Tyndale Swaledale  and others in the North of  England  for the whole Province makes but one Shire  viz  that of  Dumfries    The  Esk  is a pretty large River and gives Name to the Southeast Part of this County but we saw very little near it worth our Notice except  Kirsop  a very small Town on a River of the same Name which afterwards falls into the  Esk  and is famous for being the Place where by a Treaty after the Battle of  Pinkey  the Limits or Borders of the two Kingdoms were settled tho' the Borderers did not long observe it but robbed and plundered one another upon all Occasions as Opportunity offered  This River soon leaves  Scotland  and running into the  English  Border empties itself into the  Solway  Firth which receives all the Rivers on this Part of the Island as well from  England  as from  Scotland    The first Place of Note we came to in  Scotland  was  Annand  the chief Town of  Annandale  which being a Seaport and having a good Harbour was once a Town of pretty good Trade but it was often taken by the  English  who at last burnt it to the Ground in the Reign of King  Edward  VI from which it never recovered Here was a good Salmon Fishery and a Trade to  Ireland  by the  Isle of Man  but most of the Merchants and Men of Substance being removed to  Dumfries  the Town continues to all Appearance in a State of irrevocable Decay  The Town and Castle of  Lockmaben  is a Royal Burgh as well as  Annand  Three Parts of it are surrounded by Lakes which afford excellent Fish and one particularly which is found nowhere else The Castle as well as that of  Annand  is now demolished  M  ffet  is remarkable for its medicinal Springs They rise from the Top of a Rock near the Town There are two Wells near one another The Waters purge and vomit and are very good against Colicky and Nephritical Pains powerfully removing Obstructions in the Bowels They are applied outwardly to Ulcers and for Pains in the Joints They  have more Virtue in dry Seasons and in Summer and Autumn than in Winter and rainy Weather  The Town of  Rivel  also deserves to be mention'd on account of a very good Salt made out of a particular Sand there which they gather up and boil  From  Annand  keeping the Sea as close as we could to the Left we went on due West to  Dumfries  a Seaport Town at the Mouth of the River  Nid  or  Nith  which gives Name to the third Division of the County called  Nithsdale  but this Town is the Capital of the whole Shire and indeed of all the Southwest Part of  Scotland  Here as in some few other Ports on this Side of the Island the Benefits of Commerce obtained to this Country by the Union appear much more visible than on the Eastside  Dumfries  was always a good Town with large Streets and full of reputable and wealthy Merchants who trade into foreign Parts and employ a considerable Number of Ships especially since they have embarked in Trade to  England  and the  English  Plantations This Town is also advantageously situated for an Increase of Commerce on the River  Nid  or  Nith  for tho' it stands near two Leagues from the Sea yet the Tide flows up to the Town and Ships of Burden come close up to the Key and about four Miles below it the largest Merchantships in  Britain  may ride in Safety  Over the River  Nith  is a very fine Stonebridge at this Place with nine Arches and so broad that two Coaches may go abreast on it Here they have also an Exchange for the Merchants a handsome Church a  Tolbooth  or Prison and a Townhall for the Use of the Magistrates They had formerly a Woolen Manufacture here but the Union has in great measure suppressed these Things in  Scotland  the  English  supplying them much better and cheaper yet at the same time it must be observed that the  Scots  have more than an Equivalent by an open Trade to  England  and all the  English  Plantations  The Castle in this Town is very old yet is still pretty good and strong This Castle as well as that at  Carlavrok  near the Mouth of the River which has been a very magnificent Structure belonged formerly to the antient Family of the  Maxwells  Earls of  Nithsdale  the only remaining Branch of which being unhappily embarked in the late Rebellion and taken in Arms at  Preston  made his Escape out of the Tower and is now abroad under Forfeiture  The Inhabitants of the Town of  Dumfries  exerted themselves in a distinguishing manner for the present Establishment in the Year fortify'd the Town at a great Expence and provided themselves with Arms and Ammunition This involving them in a larger Debt an Act passed  Anno  for laying a Duty of Two Pennies  Scots  upon every  Scots  Pint of Ale or Beer sold within the Town and its Privileges for paying the said Debts and for building a new Church the other being not capacious enough to hold the Inhabitants and also to make a convenient Harbour there for the Preservation of Ships and Improvement of Trade  This Act enabled them to make some Progress in the design'd Projections but the Town having been forced to rebuild Part of their old Church the Councilhouse and Prison which were become ruinous they were render'd unable to proceed in the most useful Parts of their Undertaking and as the Act expired in the th of King  George  II they procured the same to be continued in that Session for Years longer and also an additional Duty on the Tonnage of Shipping and on Goods imported and exported into and out of the Port of  Dumfries  Which they hope will enable them completely to finish all they intended  There are many considerable Woods in this County the chief of which is  Holy Wood  where was an Abbey which gave Surname to the famous Astrologer  Johannes de Sacro Bosco  or  Holy Wood Drumlanrick  also the noble Palace of the Duke of  Queensberry  is remarkable for its Wood of Oak six Miles long  At this Town the River  Nith  parts the Stewarty of  Galloway  and the Shire of  Dumfries  and in the middle of the Bridge over it is a Gate which is the Limit between them This Neighbourhood of  Galloway  which is a great and rich Province promotes the Trade of this Place very much  In  November  here was a great Struggle in View to the Elections of Members for the succeeding Parliament and the Town of  Dumfries  signaliz'd themselves by the following extraordinary Act which we shall give without making any Remarks upon it or the Occasion of it  "At  Dumfries August  The said Day the Deacon Convener and Deacons of the several Corporations having the Advice and Consent of the Grand Committee and of the Community and whole Members of the Corporations taking to their Consideration the Reports and Suspicions now going current upon Persons setting up for Deacons and the offering and giving or promising Compliments Rewards Gifts Remunerations and good Deeds by themselves or Trustees interposed or Persons for their Behoof either at this present or at a greater Distance with Prospect and View of the Election for the five Burghs for the Parliament of  Great Britain  when the ensuing Session is determined and being desirous to suppress such Methods and any Report thereof do according to all Laws Divine and Human Equity and Reason enact and declare and be it enacted and declared by  these Presents That after the Date hereof no Person or Persons Members of the several Corporations whether Deacon late Deacon Boxmaster late

to be prosecuted before the Convener and Deacons or Civil Judge at their Option by the General Boxmaster and the Probation be by Oath Writ or Witnesses if the same can be found And these Presents are signed by the Deacons as instructed by their Corporations and in their Name Place and Day aforesaid"  We could not pass  Dumfries  without going out of our Way to see the Castle of  Drumlanrig  the fine Palace of the Duke of  Queensberry  just mentioned which stands at Miles Distance upon the same River The Vale on either Side is pleasant and tolerably good But when these rapid Rivers overflow  their Banks they do not like  Nile  or even like the  Thames  and other Southern Streams fatten and enrich the Soil but on the contrary they lodge so much Sand and Splinters of Stone upon the Surface of the Earth and among the Roots of the Grass that it spoils and beggars it nay the Water is sometimes hurried on with such Force that it washes the best Part of the Earth away where the Soil is light  Drumlanrig  is like a fine Picture in a dirty Grotto or an Equestrian Statue set up in a Barn It is environed with Mountains which have the wildest and most hideous Aspect of any in all the South Part of  Scotland    We were not so surprised with the Height of the Mountains and the Barrenness of the Country beyond them as we were with the Manners of the People who are not so polished here as in the other Parts of  Scotland  But what was most wonderful was to see so glorious a Palace with such fine Gardens and every thing about it so truly magnificent standing in a wild and mountainous Country where nothing but what was desolate and dismal could be expected However the Situation like that of  Chatsworth  in  Derbyshire  is certainly a Foil to the Buildings and sets them off with greater Advantage  If you come to the Palace by the Road which leads to it from  Edinburgh  you pass the River  Nith  which is there both broad and deep over a stately Stonebridge erected by the noble Founder of the Castle and Builder of the House the first Duke of  Queensberry    The Building is Foursquare with Roundels in the inner Angles of the Court in every one of which is a Staircase and a kind of Tower on the Top It stands on the Summit of a rising Ground which is beautifully laid out in Slopes and Terraces At the Extent of the Gardens are Pavilions and Banquetinghouses  exactly answering to one another and the Greens Espaliers and Hedges are in great Perfection  The Apartments are fine and richly furnished The Gallery is filled from one End to the other with Family Pictures of the Duke's Ancestors most of them at full Length and in their Robes of State or of Office  William  the first of the Family was a younger Son of  James  Earl of  Dowglas  who got the Barony of  Drumlanrig  by a Deed from his Father as his Portion in the Time of King  Robert  III He was afterwards sent Embassador to  England  to ransom King  James  I who was detained there In the Year the late Duke of  Queensberry  was created Duke of  Dover  as also Marquis of  Beverly  and Baron of  Rippon  in  England    The next Trip we made was to  Galloway  so called from the  Gauls  from whom the antient Inhabitants descended It is divided into two different Districts that towards the West is called the Shire of  Wigton  and the other towards the East which as I said before begins at the middle of the Bridge of  Dumfries  is called the Stewarty of  Kirkcudbright  of which the  Maxwells  Earls of  Nithsdale  were Heretable Stewards The Country hereabouts seems one continued Heath proper for Grazing small Cattle which are generally sold in  England  and whereever you perceive a Grove of Trees you may depend upon it there is a Laird's House near it which are mostly old Towers of Stone strongly built to prevent a Surprize from Inroads which were frequent between the two Nations before the Death of Queen  Elizabeth    The first Town of Note on the Coast is  Kirkcudbright  Tho' its Situation is extremely convenient for carrying on a very advantageous Commerce we saw nothing but a Harbour without Ships a Port without Trade and a Fishery without Nets This  is owing partly to the Poverty and partly to the Disposition of the Inhabitants who are indeed a sober grave religious Sort of People but have no Notion of acquiring Wealth by Trade for they strictly obey the Scriptures in the very Letter of the Text by  being content with such Things as they have  The River  Dee  which enters the Sea here and forms the Harbour comes out of the Mountains near  Carrick  and is so full of Turnings and Meanders that tho' it is not above Miles in a Line it runs near Miles in its Course  The Country of  Galloway  lies due West from  Dumfries  and as that Part of it they call the  Upper Galloway  runs out farther into the  Irish  Seas than the rest all that Bay on the Southside may be reckoned Part of  Solway Firth  as all on the Northside is called the  Firth of Clyde  tho' near Miles from the River itself  The Western  Galloway  or the Shire of  Wigton  runs out with a Peninsula so far into the Sea that from the utmost Shores you see the Coast of  Ireland  as plain as you see  Calais  from  Dover Port Patrick  which is the ordinary Place for the Ferry or Passage to  Belfast  and other Ports in  Ireland  has a tolerable good Harbour and a safe Road but there is very little Use for it the Packetboat and a few fishing Vessels are the Sum of its Navigation There was nothing here to invite our Stay for 'tis a mean dirty homely Place and as we had no Business but to see the Coast we came away very ill satisfied with our Accommodation Upon a Hill near the Town we could plainly see  Ireland  to the Southwest the Coast of  Cumberland  and the  Isle of Man  to the Southeast and the  Isle of Ila  and the Mull of  Kintyre  to the Northwest  As we passed into the Peninsula we stopt at  Stranrawer  situate on the Northside of the Isthmus which is formed by two Arms of the Sea one on  the Northside called  Lochrain  and the other on the South called the Bay of  Glenluce  On each Side of this Isthmus is an excellent Road for Ships But we could discover no Genius in the People for Trade or for Sea Affairs of any Kind  Six Miles South of  Wigton  lies  Whithern  the antient  Candida Casa  a Royal Burgh but very poor especially since the Dissolution of the Priory In this Town was the Seat of the Bishop of  Galloway  which was founded by St  Ninian  about Years ago  But tho' the People of  Galloway  especially on the Sea Coast are much to blame for not falling in to Commerce Navigation  c  yet they are not quite idle for they are great Cultivators of the Earth and Breeders of Cattle of which they send above Head every Year to  England  Besides they have the best Breed of strong low punch Horses in  Britain  if not in  Europe  which are from thence called  Galloways  These Horses which are very much bought up in  England  are remarkable for being good natural Pacers strong easy Goers hardy gentle wellbroken and above all not apt to tire  Proceeding from  Lower Galloway  hither we had like to have been driven down the Stream of a River tho' a Countryman went before for our Guide for the Water swelled upon us as we passed and the Stream was very strong so that we were obliged to turn our Horses Heads to the Current and sloping over edg'd near the Shore by Degrees whereas if our Horses had stood directly cross the Stream they could not have kept their Feet The Inhabitants follow Fishing as well in the Sea as in the Rivers and Loughs which lie everywhere under the Hills it which about  September  they catch an incredible Number of excellent Eels by which they are no less Gainers than by their little Horses  This Part of the Country is very mountainous and some of the Hills prodigiously high but they were all covered with Sheep and other Cattle the Gentlemen hereabouts being the greatest Sheepmasters for so they call themselves and the greatest Breeders of Black Cattle and Horses in the whole Kingdom  We now entered the Shire of  Aire  full North from the Mull or Northpoint of  Galloway  And as we before coasted the South Bay or Firth of  Solway  which parts  England  from  Scotland  so now we coasted the Firth of  Clyde  which for near Miles lies on the Westside of the Shore standing away Northeast from the Point of the Mull This Shire is divided into three great Bailleries  viz Carrick Kyle  and  Cunningham    Carrick  is a more fruitful and better cultivated Country than  Galloway  and not so mountainous but it does not so much abound in Cattle especially Sheep and Horses Tho' there is no considerable Port in this Part of the Country yet the People begin to trade here and those who live towards the Coast are great Fishermen and are employed by the Merchants of  Glasgow  and other Places to catch Herrings for them  Maybole  is the chief Town but tho' it stands on the Coast it has no Harbour and is poor and decayed The Market is pretty good because there are many Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood and the Coast near it full of People but the Houses are mean low and very coarse The Family of  Kennedy  Earls of  Cassils  are or were Lords of great Part of the Country and have a good antient Seat but we did not go to see it  Coming to the North Bounds of  Carrick  we passed the River  Dun  over a Bridge of one Arch consisting of Feet which is much larger than the  Rialto  at  Venice  or the middle Arch of the great Bridge at  York  We found many large ones in this  Country tho' I think none so large as this except at  Glasgow  and  Stirling  This Bridge led us into the County of  Kyle  the second Division of the Shire of  Aire  Here I observed that contrary to our Expectation we found the farther North we travelled the Country was the finer better and richer  Kyle  is more populous than  Carrick  and the Soil being better here and the Country more plain and level so on the Banks of the River there are abundance of Gentlemens Seats tho' most of them are built Castlewise because of Enemies But that Fear being now over they begin to plant and inclose after the Manner of  England    The  Scots  Writers tell us a long Story of a great Battle in this Country between  Coilus  or  Kylus  a  British  King and their  Fergus  I where the former was killed and from thence the Country took his Name Many Monuments of this Battle are still to be seen here The Place where were it was fought is called  Coilfield  a Church near it is called  Coiltown  Kirk The River near which it was won and which falls into the River  Aire  four Miles above the Town of  Aire  is called  Coil  a Lake not far from it near which the  Scots  encamped is called  Lake Fergus  A Trumpet resembling a crooked Horn which has a very shrill Sound was digged up in the Field of Battle and is still kept in the Laird of  Caprington  's House called  Coilfield  and made use of to call his Servants and Workmen together Here or as some say at  Largis  in the Bay of  Clyde  was another bloody Battle in the Year between King  Alexander  III of  Scotland  and  Acho  King of  Norway  who came to the Port of  Aire  with a great Fleet of Ships and Men who after ravaging the Country was routed and lost both his Army and Ships At this last Battle an  Irish  Gentleman of the Name of  Mackenzie  behaved so well that King  Alexander  gave him the  Lands of  Kintail  which continued in the Possession of the Earl of  Seaforth  his Successor till the late Earl taking Part with the Pretender his Estate became forfeited From this brave  Irishman  are descended the numerous Name of  Mackenzie    Over the River  Aire  is a Bridge of Four Arches near the new Town and South of the Bridge stands the old Town of  Aire  or  Erigena  famous for its Antiquity and Privileges It has a very large Jurisdiction of near Miles reaching from the Mouth of  Clyde  to the Borders of  Galloway  It stands on a sandy Plain but has pleasant green Fields two Miles South and North of it In the Fields betwixt the Mouth of the River  Dun  and  Aire  stands a very beautiful Church The Town has a very good Harbour in the River and lies conveniently for Trade And 'tis easy to see that it has been much larger than it is at present It is now like an old Beauty and shews the Ruins of a good Face but is still decaying every Day and from having been the fifth best Town in  Scotland  as the Townsmen say it is now the fifth worst which is owing to the Decay of its Trade So true it is that Commerce is the Life of Cities of Nations and even of Kingdoms What was the Reason of the Decay of Trade in this Place is not easy to determine the People themselves being either unwilling or unable to tell Here over the River  Irvin  which divides  Aire  from  Cunningham  is a good Bridge of four Arches  Aire  is noted for the treacherous Murder of many Noblemen and Gentlemen by the  English  in  Wallace  's Time when they were called together during a Truce after  Edward  I had overrun the Country on Pretence of holding a Court of Justice and were treacherously hanged one after another as they entered the King's large Barns where the Court was held  This was as severely as justly revenged by  Wallace  with whom as Warden of  Scotland  they had  made the Truce and whom they endeavoured to entice thither by their Charter of Peace as they had done a great many others of Quality But he having Notice of what had passed surprised them that very Night in their Jollity rejoicing that they had as they thought by these treacherous Murders secured  Scotland  for ever and having set Guards round the Barn that none should escape he burnt all the  English  in them The Ruins of those Barns are still shewn here  Oliver Cromwell  built a Citadel at  Aire  well fortify'd with a Fosse and a Stone Wall At the Restoration it was demolished and at present only some Houses and Angles of the Ramparts are standing  Two Miles North of  Aire  Town stands  Kincase  which has been from Time immemorial a Place of Retirement for Leprous Persons  From  Aire  keeping still North we came to  Irwin  upon a River of the same Name Here they have a Port which formerly was in much better Condition than it had been for some Years past the Harbour being so much decay'd by Length of Time and other Accidents that the Trade of the Town began to decay for the Water not being confined to its proper Chanel the Harbour became so choaked up with SandBanks that it was of little Use to what it had been so that Ships of very small Burden were freqently shut up for several Months in the River before they could sail out to Sea At the same time the Townhouse Church Streets and other publick Works as the common Gaol and one of the Arches of the Bridge were all in a ruinous Condition All which occasion'd an Act of Parliament to pass in the Ninth of King  George  II for laying a Duty of Twopennies  Scots  upon every  Scots  Pint of Ale or Beer sold in the Town of  Irvin  and its Liberties and a Duty of a Penny Sterling  upon every Ton of Coals shipped off for Transportation By which means the Harbour will soon be restored to its pristine Goodness and the Town to its former flourishing Condition But thus much must be said that notwithstanding the declining Condition of its Harbour before this Act passed it carried on a greater Trade than most of the Ports between  Aire  and  Dumfries  Their chief Trade is in  Scots  Coal which they export in great Quantities to  Ireland  for the neighbouring Hills abound with this Commodity  Irvin  is the Capital of that Division of the Shire of  Aire  which they call  Cunningham  and is really within the Firth of  Clyde  tho' not actually within the River itself The Name of  Cunningham  signifies  the King's Habitation  from the Beauty of its Situation  As it has more Trade than the other Parts I have been speaking of so it is better built Here are two handsome Streets a good Quay and a capacious Harbour The Country is rich and fruitful filled with Gentlemens Seats and wellbuilt Houses and whereever you turn your Eye you see nothing but beautiful Enclosures pleasant Pastures and Grass Grounds so that we thought ourselves in  England  again It is said this inclosing the Ground was owing to the  English  Soldiers who were placed here and in  Kyle  by  Oliver Cromwell  for at  Aire  he built a Citadel as I have said these prompted and encouraged the People to inclose and improve their Lands and instructed them in the Manner of Husbandry practised in  England  which they have not forgot to this Day  A very extraordinary Storm of Thunder and Lightning happened here on the th of  November  which deserves to be taken notice of for the Terror it occasion'd it being equally uncommon for the Season of the Year and the Climate  At Noon began to fall a very heavy Rain which ended in such a Shower of large Hail that every body betook themselves to Shelter from its Violence This was followed with a sudden and most dreadful Flash of Fire and Crack of Thunder The Lightning accompanied the Thunder which did not continue rolling as usually short and quick but the Noise seemed greater and more frightful than as if all the Ordnance on Earth had been at one Instant discharged The Whole seemed to break upon the  Tolbooth  and Steeple drove in much of the Roof on two Sides so as Waggons might pass thro' the Steeple was much shattered and the Crevices large The Townclock was broke to Pieces the Work either calcin'd or melted The strong Door of the Prison was burst up notwithstanding its large iron Bars A Lad of Fourteen was killed as he stood at a Window and his Cloaths intirely consumed his Brother aged Twelve was thrown down near by him another Brother was struck blind their Aunt had all her Cloaths burnt to Ashes on one Side and even her Skin flay'd off worse than could have been done by any Blisteringplaister her other Side seem'd untouch'd 'Tis observable that not one Bone of any of them was broken tho' every Hair was singed and that the sulphureous Stench about them was intolerable Many other Persons were also grievously hurt Two Sailors coming from the Quay said that a large Pillar of Fire struck them in the Face which brought them to their Knees One Mr  Cunningham  said it appear'd to him as a most voluminous Pillar of Fire proceeding quick as from the Mouth of Cannon and that he thought from the uncommon Smoke over the  Tolbooth  that it had been all on Fire he was thrown down and his Foot much hurt The People had scarce recovered their Senses when two other Cracks of Thunder gave fresh Grounds of Terror so that it was apprehended the  General Judgment approached and every one prostrated themselves in Humility imploring Mercy from on high but these last tho' terrible and uncommon were nothing to the first Great hewn Stones were carried violently out of the Steeple to Baillie  Nesbitt  's House where they left Impressions  A little from  Irvin  stood  Kilmarnock  Castle the Seat of the Family of the  Boyds  Earls of  Kilmarnock  which on the th of  March  was intirely consumed with the Furniture and a curious Collection of Books in MSS nothing being saved but the Charterchest On the other Side is the Castle of  Eglington  the Seat of the antient Family of the  Montgomeries  Earls of  Eglington  On the Northeast Borders of this County where it joins to  Clydsdale  is the Castle of  London  the noble and beautiful Seat of the Earl of  London    Upon the Bay of  Clyde  stands the Town of  Largis  famous for the Defeat of the  Norwegians  by King  Alexander  III of  Scotland  which some give to  Kyle  as we have said above  Kilmaers  in the same County is the Seat of the noble and antient Family of  Cunningham  Earls of  Glencairn Camden  says that the Family derives its Original from one of that Name concerned in the Murder of  Thomas à Becket  who fled into  Scotland  on that Account and therefore bear an Episcopal Pall in their Arms but it is plain from their Motto  Over Fork over  that it is a Fork and not an Episcopal Pall and the Family no doubt is of a much higher and nobler Original  In the Sea lies  Lady Isle  where is great Plenty of Rabbets and Fowl but no Inhabitants  With the Division of  Cunningham  I quitted the Shire of  Aire  which is without Exception one of the pleasantest Counties in  Scotland    Joining to it North and bordering on the  Clyde  itself lies the Shire or rather Barony of  Renfrew    which was the antient Estate of the  Stuarts  before they succeeded to the Crown of  Scotland  and his Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  among other Titles is now styled Baron of  Renfrew  It is a pleasant rich and populous Country and tho' the Soil is not thought to be so good as in  Cunningham  yet that is abundantly recompensed by the Neighbourhood of  Glasgow  and the  Clyde  and the great Commerce of both  We kept our Rout from  Irvin  along the Coast as near as we could so that we saw all the Firth of the  Clyde  and the very Opening itself which is just at the Westcorner of this County There are some Villages and Fishing Towns within the Mouth of this River which have good Business  The first Town of Note is called  Greenock  which seems not to be an antient Place but to be grown up in later Years by being a good Road for Ships to ride in that come into and go out from  Glasgow  as Ships for  London  do in the  Downs  The Town is wellbuilt has many rich trading Families in it and a Castle to command the Road It is the chief Place in the West of  Scotland  for the Herring Fishing and the Merchants of  Glasgow  who are concerned in it employ their Vessels for catching and curing the Fish and for carrying them Abroad to Market afterwards and their being ready on all Hands to go to Sea makes them often leave the Care of their own Ships to the  Greenock  Men who are good Seamen and excellent Pilots for those difficult Seas  At the Westend of a Bay on the Firth is a small Town called  Gowrock  where is a noted Road and Harbour lately fitted up  Paisley  also stands in this County on the River  Cart  and tho' no Borough is larger than  Renfrew  and was formerly noted for its noble Abbey of the Order of  Cluny  the Monks of which wrote a Chronicle called  The black Book of Paisley  The  Abbey and Church with fair Gardens and Orchards and a little Park for fallow Deer are all inclosed with a Stone Wall about a Mile in Circuit The Water of the River  Whitecart  upon which  Paisley  stands is commended for its Largeness and the Pearls frequently found thereabouts and three Miles above They commonly fish for them in Summertime and meet with them in a Shellfish larger than an ordinary Muscle at the Bottom of the Water It lies on the Westside of  Clyde  overagainst  Glasgow  The Remains of the Abbey are still to be seen and the Town bears the Marks of having been fortified At the Westend of the Town are the Remains of a large  Roman  Camp and  Praetorium  supposed to be vaulted underneath because the Ground when trod upon sounds hollow Here it was  Mary  Queen of  Scots  was defeated by her rebellious Subjects under the Bastard Earl of  Murray  from whence she took Refuge in  England  and was there most  inhospitably  imprisoned for several Years and at last beheaded In the Lands of  Newyards  near  Paisley  on a high Ground is a Fountain noted for ebbing and flowing with the Tide  The Country between  Paisley  and  Glasgow  on the Bank of  Clyde  I take to be one of the most agreeable Places in  Scotland  for its Situation Fertility Healthiness and for the Benefits it receives from the Neighbourhood of  Glasgow  and the Sea  I am now come to the Bank of  Clyde  but my Method here as in  England  forbids my wandering North till I have given you a full View of the South The  Clyde  and the  Forth  may be said to cross  Scotland  here their two Firths not being above Miles distant from one another which if joined would divide it very near in the Centre  Nor can I refrain mentioning how easy a Work it would be to make a Navigation from the  Forth  to the  Clyde  joining the two Seas as the King of  France  has done in a Place five hundred times more difficult namely from  Tholouse  to  Narbonne  and as the late Czar of  Muscovy Peter  justly surnamed  The Great  did in several Places of infinitely greater Difficulty and Expence What an Advantage in Commerce would this be It would establish a Trade between  Ireland  and the Merchants in  Glasgow  and open a Communication between the Westcoast of  Scotland  and the East of  England  even to  London  nay several Ports of  England  on the  Irish  Sea from  Liverpool  Northward would all trade with  London  by such a Canal It would take up a Volume to lay down the several Advantages that would immediately accrue from such a Navigation and in particular in Times of War but it must lie till Posterity by the rising Greatness of their Commerce shall not only feel the Want of it but find themselves inclinable as well as able to effect it  Glasgow  is the Emporium of the West of  Scotland  being for its Commerce and Riches the second in this Northern Part of  Great Britain  It is a large stately and wellbuilt City standing on a Plain in a manner foursquare and the four principal Streets are the fairest for Breadth and the finest built that I have ever seen in one City together The Houses are all of Stone and generally uniform in Height as well as in Front The lower Stories for the most part stand on vast square  Dorick  Columns with Arches which open into the Shops adding to the Strength as well as Beauty of the Building In a Word 'tis one of the cleanliest most beautiful and bestbuilt Cities in  Great Britain    It stands on the Side of a Hill sloping to the River only that Part next the River for near onethird of the City is flat and by this means exposed to the Water upon any extraordinay Flood It is situated upon the East Bank of the  Clyde  which is not navigable to the Town but by small Vessels  Its Port therefore is  NewportGlasgow  which stands near the  Clyde  's Mouth and is an Harbour for Ships of the greatest Burden Here it is on a good Wharf or Quay the Merchants load and unload Their Customhouse is also here and their Ships are here repaired laid up and fitted out either here or at  Greenock  where Work is well done and Labour cheap  The City is join'd to the Suburbs on the West Bank of the  Clyde  by the noble Bridge I have mentioned  Where the four principal Streets meet the Crossing makes a very spacious Marketplace as may be easily imagined since the Streets are so large As we come down the Hill from the Northgate to this Place the Tolbooth and Guildhall make the Northwest Angle or Righthand Corner of the Street which is now rebuilt in a very magnificent Manner Here the Towncouncil sit and the Magistrates try such Causes as come within their Cognizance and do all their other publick Business So that as will be easily conceived the Tolbooth stands in the very Centre of the City It is a noble Structure of hewn Stone with a very lofty Tower and melodious hourly Chimes All these four principal Streets are adorned with several publick Buildings  But the chief Ornament of this City is the College or University a most magnificent and stately Fabrick consisting of several Courts The Front to the City is of hewn Stone and excellent Architecture Its Precincts were lately inlarged by some Acres of Ground purchased for it by publick Money and it is separated from the rest of the City by a very high Wall  It owes its Erection to Archbishop  Turnbull  and was legally founded by King  James  II in by virtue of a Bull from Pope  Nicolas  V granting it all the Privileges Liberties Honours Immunities  and Exemptions given by the Apostolical See to the College of  Bononia  in  Italy  for teaching Universal Learning A Rector a Dean of the Faculty a Principal or Warden who was to teach Theology three PhilosophyProfessors were established by the first Foundation and afterwards some Clergymen taught the Civil and Canon Law there  In King  James  VI established a Principal three Professors of Philosophy four Bursars a Steward to furnish their Table a Servant for the Principal a Janitor to look after the Gate and a Cook  The Family of  Hamilton  gave some of the Ground on which the College stands with an adjacent Field  Kings Parliaments the City of  Glasgow  several of the Archbishops and many particular Persons have been Benefactors to it  In the Earl of  Dundonald  gave  l  Sterling to it for the Maintenance of poor Scholars The great  Buchanan  and the famous  Cameron  had among other eminent Men their Education here  Several fine  Roman  Stones digged up in the Latterend of near  Kirkentilloch  with very curious Inscriptions have been removed to this University where before was a good Collection of Pieces of Antiquity chiefly found near the same Place  In the higher Part of the City stands the great Church formerly Cathedral and Metropolitan dedicated to St  Mungo  who was Bishop here about the Year It is a magnificent and stately Edifice and surprises the Beholders with its stupendous Bigness and the Workmanship of the Artizan The several Rows of Pillars and the exceeding high Spire which rises from a square Tower in the middle of the Cross shew a wonderful Piece of Architecture It is now divided into several Preachingplaces one above the other  Near the Church stands a ruinous Castle formerly the Residence of the Archbishop who was legal Lord or Superior of the City which stands on his Ground and from whom it received its first Charter and many Privileges It is encompassed with an exceeding high Wall of hewn Stone and has a fine Prospect into the City  The Duke of  Montrose  has so great an Interest here and in the Country round that he is in a Civil Sense Governor of this City as he is legally of their University and much beloved in these Parts  Glasgow  is a City of Business and has the Face of Foreign as well as Domestick Trade nay I may say 'tis the only City in  Scotland  at this Time that apparently increases in both The Union has indeed answered its End to them more than to any other Part of the Kingdom their Trade being new formed by it for as the Union opened the Door to the  Scots  into our  American  Colonies the  Glasgow  Merchants presently embraced the Opportunity and tho' at its first concerting the Rabble of this City made a formidable Attempt to prevent it yet afterwards they knew better when they found the great Increase of their Trade by it for they now send near Sail of Ships every Year to  Virginia New England  and other  English  Colonies in  America    But if this City could have a Communication with the Firth of  Forth  so as to send their Tobacco and Sugar by Water to  Alloway  below  Stirling  as they might from thence again to  London Holland Hamburgh  and the  Baltick  they would very probably in a few Years double their Trade  The Share they have in the Herring Fishery is very considerable and they cure their Herrings so well and so much better than they are done in any other Part of  Great Britain  that a  Glasgow  Herring is esteemed as good as a  Dutch  one  I have no room to inlarge upon the Home Trade of this City which is very considerable in many Things I shall therefore touch at some few Particulars  Here are two very handsome Sugarbaking Houses carried on by skilful Persons with large Stocks and to a very great Perfection Here is likewise a large Distillery for distilling Spirits from the Melasses drawn from Sugars by which they enjoyed a vast Advantage for a Time by a reserved Article in the Union freeing them from  English  Duties  Here is a Manufacture of Plaiding a Stuff crossstriped with yellow red and other Mixtures for the Plaids or Veils worn by the Women in  Scotland    Here is a Manufacture of Muslins which they make so good and fine that great Quantities of them are sent into  England  and to the  British  Plantations where they sell at a good Price They are generally striped and are very much used for Aprons by the Ladies and sometimes in Headcloaths by the meaner Sort of  Englishwomen    Here is also a Linen Manufacture but as that is in common with all Parts of  Scotland  which improve in it daily I will not insist upon it as a Peculiar here tho' they make a very great Quantity of it and send it to the Plantations as their principal Merchandize Nor are the  Scots  without a Supply of Goods for sorting their Cargoes to the  English  Colonies without sending to  England  for them and it is necessary to mention it here because it has been objected by some that the  Scots  could not send a sortable Cargo to  America  without buying from  England  which coming thro' many Hands and by a long Carriage must consequently be so dear that the  English  Merchants can undersell them  It is very probable indeed that some Things cannot be had here so well as from  England  so as to make out such a sortable Cargo as the  Virginia  Merchants  in  London  ship off whose Entries at the Customhouse consist sometimes of two hundred Particulars as Tin Turnery Milanery Upholstery Cutlery and other  Crookedlane  Wares in short somewhat of every Thing either for Wearing or Housefurniture building Houses or Ships  But tho' the  Scots  cannot do all this we may reckon up what they can furnish which they have not only in sufficient Quantities but some in greater Perfection than  England  itself  They have Woollen Manufactures of their own such as  Stirling  Serges  Musselburgh  Stuffs  Aberdeen  Stockens  Edinburgh  Shalloons Blankets  c  The Trade with  England  being open they have now all the  Manchester Sheffield  and  Birmingham  Wares and likewise the Cloths Kerseys Halfthicks Duffels Stockens and coarse Manufactures of the North of  England  brought as cheap or cheaper to them by Horsepacks as they are carried to  London  it being at a less Distance  They have Linens of most Kinds especially Diapers and Tablelinen Damasks and many other Sorts not known in  England  and cheaper than there because made at their own Doors  What Linens they want from  Holland  or  Hamburgh  they import from thence as cheap as the  English  can do and for Muslins their own are very acceptable and cheaper than in  England    Gloves they make better and cheaper than in  England  for they send great Quantities thither  Another Article which is very considerable here is Servants which they can transport in greater Plenty and upon better Terms than the  English  without the scandalous Art of Kidnapping Wheedling Betraying and the like for the poor People offer themselves fast enough and think it their Advantage as it certainly is to serve out their Times soberly in the foreign Plantations and then become diligent  Planters for themselves which is a much wiser Course than to turn Thieves and then be transported to save them from the Gallows This may be given as a Reason and I believe it is the only one why so many more of the  Scots  Servants who go over to  Virginia  settle and thrive there than of the  English  which is so certainly true that if it holds on for many Years more  Virginia  may be rather called a  Scots  than an  English  Plantation  I might mention many other Particulars but this is sufficient to shew that the  Scots  Merchants are not at a Loss how to make up sortable Cargoes to send to the Plantations and that if we can outdo them in some things they are able to outdo us in others If they are under any Disadvantages in the Trade I am speaking of it is that they may not perhaps have so easy a Vend and Consumption for the Goods they bring back as the  English  have at  London Bristol  or  Liverpool  for which Reason they have lately set up a Wharf at  Alloway  in the  Forth  whence they send their Tobacco and Sugars thither by Landcarriage and ship them off from thence for  Holland Hamburgh  or  London  as the Market offers and indeed they carry on a profitable Trade with  England  in Tobacco which from the Difference of Duty  c  they do with no small Advantage  Now tho' the carrying their Tobacco and Sugars several Miles over Land may be some Disadvantage yet if on the other hand it be calculated how much sooner the Voyage is made from  Glasgow  to the Capes of  Virginia  than from  London  the Difference will be made up in the Frieght and in the Expence of the Ships especially in time of War when the Chanel is thronged with Privateers and the Ships wait to go in Fleets for fear of Enemies for the  Glasgow  Vessels are no sooner out of the Firth of  Clyde  but they stretch away to the Northwest are out of the Road of the Privateers immediately and are often at the  Capes of  Virginia  before the  London  Ships get clear of the Chanel Nay even in times of Peace there must always be allowed one time with another at least fourteen or twenty Days Difference in the Voyage both going out and coming in which taken together is a Month or six Weeks in the whole Voyage and considering Wear and Tear Victuals and Wages this makes a considerable Difference in the Trade  One thing still I must take notice of before I quit  Glasgow  I have mentioned more than once the Duties laid on Ale and Beer sold in divers Towns in  Scotland  for the Benefit and publick Emolument of the said Towns but have here to take Notice of the like Duty laid for a different Purpose that is to say for a Punishment The Case was this  When the MaltDuty was extended for the first time to  Scotland  it occasioned much murmuring and particularly  Daniel Campbell    Esq  who lived at  Glasgow  and was Member for that Town having given his Vote for it in Parliament the Populace rose enter'd his House destroy'd all his Goods and Furniture and committed other Acts of Violence and Outrage  This the Legislature resenting as a Defiance of lawful Authority an Act passed in the th of King  George  I to take from the Town of  Glasgow  the Benefits of an Act before passed for laying a Duty of two Penies  Scots  on every Pint of Ale or Beer brewed for Sale in the said City and its Privileges and vesting it for the Remainder of the Term which was for thirteen Years to come  viz  from to in his Majesty to be put under the Commissioners of Excise in order to raise the Sum of  l  for satisfying the Damages and Losses sustained by Mr  Campbell  in the said Riot but it was provided that when the said Sum was paid the Duty of Two Penies  Scots  was to return for the  Remainder of the Term to the Magistrates for the Purposes for which they were originally granted This occasioned no good Blood it may be believed between the City and Mr  Campbell  but yet this was not the last time this City had the Honour to be represented in Parliament by the same Gentleman as it is joined with the Burghs of  Renfrew Ruglen  and  Dunbarton  So placable and so forgiving are the generous  Scotish  Nation or at least so little Title has the City of  Glasgow  in particular to the National Motto of  Scotland  Nor did this good Behaviour of theirs turn out to its Disadvantage for in the th of  George  II a new Act passed continuing the former Act for Twentyfive Years longer and extending it to the Villages of  Gorbells  and  Port Glasgow  both which Places were in the Jurisdiction of the City and reaped all their Advantages from its Neighbourhood the latter especially at which the People of  Glasgow  had built and constantly maintained a very commodious Harbour and yet were neither of them in the former Act  From  Glasgow  I went eight Miles Southward to  Hamilton  a Town pleasant and wellbuilt the Church of which is the Buryingplace of the Noble Family of  Hamilton  But it is chiefly noted for its fine Palace the Seat of the Duke of  Hamilton  premier Peer in  Scotland  and nearly related to the Royal Family of the  Stuarts  The House at present is large tho' Part of the Design is yet unfinished It has a fair Front with two Wings and two more are laid out in the Ichnography of the Building which are not yet begun  The Front is very magnificent all of white Freestone with regular Ornaments according to the Rules of Art The Wings are very deep and when the other two are added the Sides of the House will be like two large Fronts rather than Wings The Apartments are very noble and more fit for  the Court of a Prince than the House of a Subject The Pictures the Furniture and other Decorations are exquisitely fine and suitable to the Dignity of the great Possessors The late Duchess marrying a Branch of the Family of  Dowglas  obliged him to take the Name of  Hamilton  and so continue the Estate in her Name Her Grace had six Sons four of whom were Peers either by Birth or Creation  viz  The late Duke who was killed in a Duel with Lord  Mohun Anno    Charles  late Earl of  Selkirk  so created by King  James  VII  John  Earl of  Ruglen  and  George  late Earl of  Orkney  The other two were Lord  Basil  and Lord  Archibald  late one of the Lords of the Admiralty  The Situation of the House has all the Advantage imaginable for it stands in a plain Country near enough to the Banks of  Clyde  to enjoy the Prospect of its Stream and yet far enough from it to be out of the Reach of its Torrents and Floods  The great Park is about seven Miles in Circumference and noted for its fine Oaks and Firs and the small River  Aven  runs thro' it It is walled round with Stone and well stock'd with Deer The lesser Park is rather a great Inclosure than a Park tho' this as well as the other is extremely well planted with Trees The Gardens are finely designed but I can't say they are so well finished and kept as those at  Drumlanrig    Ruglen  is another Town in this County which gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the Family of  Hamilton  as has been said  Here is also the Town and Castle of  Dowglas  which gives Title and Surname to the Dukes of  Dowglas  Of which Family more anon  Crawford Lindsey  in this County gives Title also to the Earl of  Crawford  who claims Precedency as first Earl  In  CrawfordMoor  Gold has been found in the Sand of the Brooks after Rain and that in pretty large Pieces and they dug up  Lapis Lazuli  there The Remains of a  Roman  Causeway are to be seen in this County from one End to the other  We then turned to the Left for  Stirlingshire  and after passing the  Clyde  came to  Kilsyth  a good plain Country Burgh tolerably wellbuilt but not large near which the Marquis of  Montross  gave a great Overthrow to the Covenanters in the Civil Wars Here upon a particular Occasion we went to see the antient Seat of  Calendar  which seems now in its Decline The Town of  Falkirk  is near  Calendar  House but has nothing remarkable in it except the other old decayed House of the Earl of  Calendar    Here we plainly saw the Remains of the antient Work which they call  Severus  's Wall  Adrian  's Wall or  Graham  's Dyke for it is known by all these built by the  Romans  cross this narrow Part of the Country and fortified with Redoubts and Stations to defend the South Country from the Incursions of the  Picts Irish  and other wild Nations in the  Highlands  This Wall reached from  Dunbriton Firth  so they called the Firth of  Clyde  to the  Forth  and was several times repaired till the Destruction of the  Roman  Empire in  Britain  with which it perished Yet neither this while it stood nor the stronger one at  Newcastle  called  Severus  's Wall could so well preserve the Country from the Invasion of  Picts  and  Scots  but the  Romans  were often obliged to send powerful Succours to the Relief of the distressed  Britons Camden  thinks that this Wall was built by  Antoninus Pius  who being adopted by  Adrian  assumed his Name Be this as it will 'tis certain that in all the  Scotish  Histories it is called  Graham  's  Dyke    The Manner of the Wall is best understood by Mr  Pont  's Description in Dr  Gibson  's now Lord  Bishop of  London  Translation of  Camden  's  Britannia  p First there appears a Ditch of Feet wide before the Wall towards the Enemies Country the Wall is Feet thick but it is not known how high it was at first There is a paved Way at the Foot of the Wall five Feet broad Watchtowers within Call of one another where Centinels kept Watch Day and Night a Court of Guard to lodge a sufficient Number of Soldiers against all sudden Alarms and a Void within for the Soldiers Lodgings Besides these there are along the Wall great and noble Forts strongly intrench'd and tho' within the Wall able to receive a whole Army together The Forts which remained in Mr  Pont  's Time who traced them all were these one at  Langtoun  a Mile East of  Falkirk  one just at  Rouintree Burnhead  one at  WesterGowden  about  St Helen  's Chapel one at the  Croykill  a very great one at the Top of the  Banhill  one at  Atchindevy  one at  Kirkintilloch  or  Kaerpencolloch  one at  EastCalder  one at  HilltounCalder  one at  Balmudy  one at  Simerstone  and over  Kilvin  River and  Carestoun  one at  Atermynie  one at  Balcastle  overagainst  Banhil  one at  Kaellybe  overagainst  Croyhill  one at the  Rochhill  overagainst the  Westwood  a large one at  Bankyir  overagainst  CastleCairy  one at  Dumbase  In the Ruins of that at  Bankyir  was found a large Iron Shovel or some Instrument resembling it so weighty that it could hardly be lifted by one Man At the same Fort also were discover'd several Sepulchres covered with large rough Stones and at  DunChroe Chyr  by  MonyAbroch  were formerly large Buildings The Length of the Wall was  Scots  Miles beginning between  Queen's Ferry  and  Abercorn  it ranged along West by the  Grange  and  Kineil  to  Innereving  so on to  Falkirk  from whence it proceeded directly to the Forest of  Cumernald  next it ran to the great Fort at the  Banhill  where have  been found several Stones some with Pictures engraven upon them and with Inscriptions From whence it went to the  Peel  of  Kirkintilloch  the greatest Fort of all and so Westward to  Dumbarton  with a great Ditch upon the Northside of the Wall all along It had also many square Fortifications in form of  Roman  Camps  From  Kilsyth  we mounted the Hills black and frightful as they were to find the Road over the Moors and Mountains to  Sterling  and being directed by Guides we came to the River  Carron  The Chanel of a River appeared indeed and looked as if it had been cut out by Art thro' horrid Precipices to mark out a Course for the Water but yet not a Drop was at that time to be seen Great Stones square and formed as if cut out by Hand of a prodigious Size lay scattered in a confused manner in the very Course of the River which as we were told the Fury of the Water at other times had hurried down from the Mountains If so they must have been some Ages upon their Jouney down the Stream for 'tis not probable that a Flood often comes with a Force sufficient to move such Stones as these unless a great Quantity of Ice as well as Water comes down upon them together But in all Probability they are not not driven down by the Force of the Water at all but are  Roman  Monuments of which more byandby  Here we passed another Bridge of one Arch not quite so large as that we saw in  Galloway  but very like it 'Tis finely built of Freestone but the Shores being flat it rises so high that it is not every Head can bear to ride over it But there was a Necessity of building it with one Arch only for no Piers in the middle of the Chanel could have borne the Shock of the great Stones which sometimes come down this Stream  From hence descending on the Northside we had a View of the Firth of  Forth  on our Right and of the Castle of  Stirling  on our Left In going to the latter we passed the Water of  Bannockburn  famous in the  Scots  History for the great Battle fought here between King  Robert de Bruce  and the  English  Army commanded by King  Edward  II in Person in which the  English  were utterly overthrown and that with so terrible a Slaughter that tho' it was the greatest Army that ever marched from  England  into  Scotland  very few escaped and the King with much ado saved himself by Flight How he could save himself by a little Boat as Mr  Camden  says I cannot understand there being no River near that had any Boats in it but the  Forth  and then the King must have fled North whereas to be sure he fled to  England  with all the Speed he could He might indeed have made use of a Boat to pass the  Tweed  but that was at least Miles from the Field of Battle  Whether the  Scots  magnify this Victory or not is not my Business to inquire 'Tis certain that the  English  Army was totally overthrown here for they lost Men among whom were abundance of their Nobility and Gentry  This Place is also remarkable for the execrable Murder of King  James  III whose young Son was by some discontented Nobles worked up to this impious Deed But when his Understanding ripened he saw the Action in its proper Light and was so greatly affected by it that he did Penance for ever after by constantly wearing an Iron Chain near his Flesh  Sterling  was our next Stage an antient Town and an important Pass which together with  Dumbarton  is the Defence of the Lowlands against the Highlands for as one very knowingly said  Dumbarton  is the Lock of the Highlands and  Stirling  Castle keeps the Key The Town is situated exactly as  Edinburgh  on the Ridge of a Hill sloping down on both Sides and the Street gradually ascending from the East to the Castle which is at the Westend It is large and wellbuilt and tho' it is antient yet the Buildings are not unlike those of  Edinburgh    The Church is also a very spacious Building but not Collegiate It stands in the upper Part of the Town towards the End is of good Architecture and adorned with a lofty Tower There was formerly a Church or rather a Collegiate Chapel in the Castle and likewise a private Chapel or Oratory in the Palace for the Royal Family but they have been long disused  The Castle is not so very difficult of Access as that at  Edinburgh  but is esteemed equally strong for the Works are capable to mount more Cannon and there is a Battery that commands the Bridge which is of the utmost Importance and seems to have been the main End and Purpose for which it was built The Walls and all the Outworks are so firm that they seem in as good Condition as if they had been lately built  The Palace and Royal Apartments are very magnificent but are all in Decay and likely to continue so This is at present also the Fate of the Palaces of  Linlithgow Falkland Dumfermling  and all the other Royal Houses in  Scotland Holyroodhouse  at  Edinburgh  excepted  In the Park adjoining to the Castle were formerly large Gardens The Figure of the Walks and Grassplots is still plainly to be seen  The Park here is large and walled about as most of the Parks in  Scotland  are but there is little or no Wood in it The Earls of  Mar  of the Name of  Ereskin  who claims to be Hereditary Keeper of the King's Children and of this Castle had a House  at the upper End of the Town very finely situated for Prospect but not for Security being too near the Castle for were the Castle ever to suffer a close Siege and be vigorously defended it would run a great Risque of being demolished on one Side or other besides this Nearness to the Castle makes the Site more confused to the Eye  From a pretty little Flowergarden upon one of the Bastions on the Northside of the Castle we had a most agreeable Prospect over the Valley and of the Meanders Turnings or Reaches of the River  Forth  which are extremely beautiful They are so spacious and return so near themselves with so regular and exact a Sweep that I believe the like of it is not to be seen in  Britain  and perhaps not in  Europe  especially in so large a River The  Seine  indeed between  Paris  and  Roan  fetches a Sweep something like these and some Miles longer but then it is but one whereas here are three double Reaches which makes six Returns together and each of them above three  Scots  Miles in Length And as the Bows are almost equal for Breadth as the Reaches are for Length it makes the Figure complete It is an admirable Sight indeed and continues from a little below the great Bridge at  Stirling  to  Alloway  the Seat of the Earls of  Mar  The Form of this Winding may be conceived by the Length of the Way for it is twentyfour Miles from  Stirling  to  Alloway  by Water and hardly four Miles by Land  One would think these large Windings of the Stream would check the Tide very much but on the contrary we found the Tide of Flood make up very strong under  Stirlingbridge  tho' it does not flow above seven or eight Miles farther for the Stream grows narrow apace and the rapid Current of all Rivers in this Country checks the Tide when it comes into narrow Limits The same is the Case in the  Tyne  at  Newcastle  and the  Tweed  at  Berwick    in both which tho' the Tide flows as strong in at the Mouth of these Rivers as in this yet the Navigation goes not near so far up  The Bridge of  Stirling  has only four Arches but they are very large and the Chanel widens considerably below it At  Alloway  it is above a Mile broad and deep enough for Ships of any Burden so that the  Glasgow  Merchants are certainly in the right to settle Warehouses there and ship off their Goods for the Eastern Countries  I was very curious to inquire into the Course of this River as I had been before into that of the  Clyde  to see if there was a Possibility of uniting their Waters for an Inland Navigation because I had observed that the Charts and Plans of the Country brought them almost to meet But when I came to survey the Ground exactly I found the Mapmakers greatly mistaken and that they had not only given the Situation and Courses of the Rivers wrong but the Distances also However upon the whole I saw plainly that notwithstanding several Circumstances which might obstruct it and cause the Workmen to fetch some winding Turns out of the Way yet a Canal of about Miles would fairly join the Rivers and make a clear Navigation from the  Irish  to the  German  Sea and that this could be done without any considerable Obstruction for they would not have Occasion for above four Sluices in the whole Way and those only to head a Bason or Receptacle to contain a Flush of Water to push on the Vessels either way as Occasion required  How easy such a Work would be and how advantageous not to  Scotland  only but even to  England  and  Ireland  the Thing itself will explain at first Sight I could enter upon particular Descriptions of the Work and answer all the Objections raised from the great Quantity of Waters in the Winter and the  Force and Fury of their Streams but I have no room for it here  There is a very considerable Manufacture at  Stirling  for Serges or Shalloons which they make and dye very well nor has the  English  Manufacture for Shalloons broke in so much upon them as it was apprehended it would This Manufacture is a great Support to the poor People that are employed in it who are thereby enabled to live very comfortably  The Family of  Ereskine  is very considerable here for besides the Earls of  Mar  and  Buchan  there are several Gentlemen of Quality of that Name  We had here a very fine Prospect both East and West Eastward we could plainly see the Castle of  Edinburgh  and the Hill called  Arthur  's  Seat  in the Royal Park at  Holyroodhouse  and Westward we could see  Dumbarton  Castle To the Northward we saw  Dumblane  and the Field of Battle called  Sheriffmuir  between it and  Sterling    But our Business was not to the North yet for having a Part of the Border to view we went from  Stirling  to the Southeast over some of the same Hills we passed at our coming hither that we might leave nothing behind to oblige us to come this Way again The Duke of  Argyll  has a small House here which the Family call the  Lowland House  to distinguish it from the many Seats they are possessed of in the Highlands This Seat belonged formerly to the Earls of  Stirling  The County round it South of the  Forth  is called  Stirlingshire  or  Strivelingshire    Stirling  was one of the Boundaries of the  Roman  Empire in  Britain  as appears by the Inscription on a Stone below the Castle towards the Bridge importing That one of the Wings of their Army kept Guard there On the Right of the Town stood the noble Abbey of  Cambuskenneth  The River  Carron  which I mentioned before is famous for some  Roman  Monuments particularly two little Hills  called by the Vulgar  Dunipace i e  Hills of Peace and two Miles lower is a round Edifice of Stone which by the Description resembles what the  Romans  called the  Temple of Terminus  But  Buchanan  thinks they were rather Monuments of some great Actions performed here  From  Stirling  we went directly to  Linlithgow  a large Town well built with a stately Townhouse but most famous for the noble Palace of the Kings of  Scotland  which is the least decayed of all the rest for King  James  VI repaired or rather rebuilt it and his two Sons Prince  Henry  and Prince  Charles  afterwards King of  England  had Apartments here which a Traveller may easily distinguish by the different Coats of Arms especially over those called the  Prince's Lodgings    This Palace stands on a rising Ground which runs into the Lake in form of an Amphitheatre and has a Descent resembling Terracewalks There are two Towers at each Corner of the Court with Apartments and a curious Fountain in the Middle adorned with several fine Statues from whence the Water rises to a good Height A noble Park also belongs to it  The Church of St  Michael  makes a Part of this Building and is a Wing on the Righthand of the first Court as the proper Offices make the Left The Innercourt is very large and elegant for the Taste of the Times In the Middle of this is the large Fountain I have mentioned which still shews the Remains of some good Carving and other Ornaments  Here King  James  V restored the Order of the Knights of St  Andrew  as the Order of Knights of the  Bath  lately was in  England  and erected a Throne and Stalls for them in St  Michael  's Church making  it the Chapel of the Order He was likewise the first who ordered the  Thistle  to be added to the Badge of the Order and the Motto  viz Nemo me impune lacesset  which is worn about it in the Royal Arms was of his Invention This Prince seems to have been very much honoured in the World for he wore the Badges of three Orders besides his own  viz  That of the  Garter  conferred upon him by his Uncle the King of  England  that of the  Golden Fleece  by the Emperor then King of  Spain  that of St  Michael  by the King of  France    In his Time the  Green Ribband  was worn by the Knights Companions of this Order but King  James  VII changed it to the  Blue  like that of the Knights of the Garter in  England  After the Union Queen  Anne  the Sovereign of both to distinguish them restored the Green Ribband and intended to have called a Chapter of the Order to bring it once more to its full Lustre but was prevented by Death  In this Town the Earl of  Murray  Lord Regent was murdered with a Musketbullet shot by one  Hamilton  This Earl was a natural Son of King  James  V and aspiring to the Crown joined with the Reformers having first got the Revenues of the Convents of  St Andrews  and  Pittenweem  whereof he was Abbot or Prior secured to him and his Heirs His Ambition and Intrigues were the chief Cause of almost all the Troubles of Queen  Mary  's Reign But I shall have Occasion to mention him in another Place  At  Linlithgow  is a great Linen Manufacture as there is at  Glasgow  and the Water of the Lake here is esteemed so extraordinary for Bleaching or Whitening of Linen Cloth that a vast deal of it is brought hither from other Parts of the Country for that Purpose This Lake is situate on the Northside of the Town and between it and the Palace  are Terracewalks which are so beautiful that a more delightful Place can scarce be seen  In the Year An Act passed for laying Twopenies  Scots  on every  Scots  Pint of Ale or Beer sold in  Linlithgow  and its Liberties in order to repair the publick Buildings which were run to Decay such as the Church and Townhouse  c  to supply such Parts of the Town with fresh Water as want it to pave and amend the Streets and also the Avenues within a Mile round the Town for discharging the TownDebts and other necessary Purposes Great Progress was made in these laudable Undertakings by virtue of this Act but the End being not sufficiently attained nor likely to be at the Expiration of the Act these Duties were farther continued for Years more by an Act which passed in the Year which it is not doubted will completely answer all the proposed Ends to the great Advantage of the Town and Country  Forfichen  formerly the Residence of the Knights of  Malta  is two Miles Southwest from  Linlithgow    Near a Place called  Kips  South from this Town is an antient Chapel or Altar of great unpolished Stones leaning so as to support one another The Vulgar call them  Arthur's Oven  but the Learned think them to be a Temple of  Terminus  built by the  Romans  and others still there are who conjecture them to be a Temple of the  Celts  or  Druids  Near this Chapel or Altar is a Circle of great Stones and on two adjacent Hills are the Remains of old Camps with great Heaps of Stones and antient Graves which some think  Roman  Works  About four Miles North from  Linlithgow  lies the Castle of  Abercorn  supposed to be the  Kebercurnig  of  Bede  where began the  Roman  Wall thought to be begun by  Severus    From  Linlithgow  we turned to the Right and following the  Clyde  upwards from a little above  Hamilton  where we were before we came into the Shire of  Clydsale  This Tract has some Remains of  Roman  Antiquity for from  Errickstone  to  Mauls Mitre  which borders upon the Shire of  Renfrew  are evident Footsteps of a  Roman  Causeway for several Miles together and there is a Tradition that another  Roman  Street went from  Lanark  to the  Roman  Camp near  Falkirk    Lanark  is the Capital of this County but is no extraordinary Town its Bridge however is very remarkable It was built at a vast Expence by the Inhabitants But the violent Current of the Water rendering the keeping it in Repair too chargeable for the Town to support and making it require frequent Reparations an Act of the  Scotish  Parliament passed  Anno  impowering them to collect Tolls for Pontage in order to keep up the same This Act was in Force for Years and there was so much Reason for it and the Bridge was of so great Use to the County that tho' the Duties expired in the Year yet the Rates were voluntarily paid for many Years till some Disputes arising with some selfish Persons who wanted to reap the Fruits of other Peoples Labour for nothing an Act was passed in the th of King  George  II for enabling the Magistrates to repair and maintain so useful a Work This Act is to continue in Force for Years and is so reasonable that it ought and perhaps will be perpetuated For the Rates are only  d  Sterling for every Coach or Chariot drawn by four or more Horses  d  for every Cart or Wheelcarriage  d  for every Sledge or Horse loaded or unloaded Twothirds of a Peny for every Ox Cow or Bull Onesixth of a Peny for every Calf Hog Sheep or Lamb and the same for every Foot Passenger who must be a worse Beast than any I have named to grudge it for so great a Convenience  A little below this Town the River  Dowglas  falls into the  Clyde  and gives the Name of  Dowglasdale  to the Lands near it In a dull Vale near this River stands a very old Castle which has been the paternal Seat of the great Family of  Dowglas  for above a thousand Years for which Reason it is still kept in Repair But by the frequent Additions to the Building it is become such a wild irregular Mass that at a Distance it seems rather like a Town than a single Fabrick tho' the Apartments are very noble  The complete History of this Family would take up a Volume by itself as it actually has in a late Work where the Heroes of the Name are fully set forth and all the illustrious Actions they have been concerned in I shall only observe that there are no less than Seven Branches of this Family in the Peerage of  Great Britain  namely the Duke of  Dowglas  who is Chief of the Name the Duke of  Queensberry  and  Dover  the Earls of  Morton Dumbarton  and  March  and the Lords  Mordington  and  Forfar  the latter of whom was unhappily killed at the Fight near  Dumblaine  against the Pretender  The Country abounds with Coals Peat and Limestone but what turns to the greatest Profit are the Leadmines belonging to the Earl of  Hopton  not far from which after Rains the Country People find Pieces of Gold some of which are of a considerable Bigness This is thought to be what  Camden  calls  CrawfordMoor  where  Lapis Lazuli  is daily dug up with little Trouble as I have said  Here we left the lastmentioned wild Place on the Right and went Westward into the Shire of  Peebles  The first Town we came to of any Note was  Peebles  which stands on the Bank of the  Tweed  and is Capital of the County The Town is small and but very indifferently built or inhabited yet there are some good Houses in it It was formerly remarkable for three Churches three Gates three  Streets and three Bridges of which that over  Tweed  has five Arches  The Country hereabouts is very hilly but those Hills are covered with Sheep which are a principal Part of the Estates of the Gentry A great Quantity of them are sent into  England  to the great Damage of the Poor who are thereby deprived of the Advantage of manufacturing their Wool They used formerly to export it to  France  but by the Act of Union the Exportation of it was prohibited upon the severest Penalties and to make the Gentlemen of the Southern Counties amends for this Loss a great Sum of Money was at that time granted them as an Equivalent as I have mentioned before to encourage them to set the Poor to work  This County of  Tweedale  has two remarkable Lakes in it the one called  Westwater Lake  abounds so with Eels and other Fish about  August  that during a West Wind they come out in such Shoals into a small River which runs from the Lake that we were told they are ready to overthrow the People who go in to catch them The other is  Lochgenen Lake  upon  Genenhill  which falls into  Annandale  from a Precipice of Feet high that many times Fishes are killed by the Fall of the Water  The  Frazers  were Ancestors by Marriage to the Family of  Tweedale  and of this Name was that great Captain who contributed so much to the Victory which the  Scots  obtained in one Day over three  English  Armies at  Rosbin  during  Wallace  's Administration  Merlin  is said to be buried in the Churchyard of  Drumelzier  in this County and according to an old Prophecy  That the Kingdoms should be united when  Tweed  and  Pausel  met at his Grave  they say that it happened so by an Inundation when King  James  VI came to the Crown of  England Anno  the only time before or since it ever did so  Some Remains of Antiquity are visible in this County The Place called  Randal  's  Trench  seems to have been a  Roman  Camp and a Causeway leads from it half a Mile together to the Town of  Lyne    In this County are two very lively Monuments of the Vanity of human Glory The first is the Foundation of a prodigious Building more like a Royal Palace than the Seat of a private Nobleman begun by the Earl of  Morton  whose Head was no sooner cut off than his Design perished for it has never since been carried on  The other is the Palace of  Traquair  built and finished by the late Earl of  Traquair  for some Years Lord High Treasurer of  Scotland  and a Person in the highest Posts both of Honour and Profit in the Kingdom who yet lost all by the Fatality of the Times for growing into universal Dislike by his Conduct under King  Charles  I he sunk into the most abject Condition of human Life even to want Bread and to take Alms and died in those miserable Circumstances about a Year before the Restoration The House is noble the Design great and well finished but the Owner was soon turned out of it by his Enemies who thought the sparing his Life an Act of great Mercy  Bishop  Burnet  represents this Earl as a very meanspirited Man and one that suffered himself to be made so vile a Tool in other Peoples Mischiefs that he fell unpitied 'Tis very remarkable that he was despised even by the Party which he had served and but too faithfully adhered to  Here we saw the Ruins of the once famous Abbey of  Melross  the Greatness of which may be a little guessed at by the vast Extent of its Remains One may still distinguish many noble Parts of the Monastery particularly the great Church or Chapel as  large as some Cathedrals the Choir of which is visible and Feet in Length besides what may have been pulled down at the Eastend and by the Thickness of the Foundations there must have been a large and strong Tower or Steeple in the Centre of the Church There are likewise several Fragments of the House itself and the Court and other Buildings are so visible that 'tis easy to know it was a most magnificent Place in its Day  Following the Course of the  Tweed  we passed by abundance of antient Seats of Gentlemen whose Possessions are large in this Country such as that of the Family of  Dowglas  of whom one is called  Dowglas  of  Cavers  who is Hereditary Sheriff of the County and who shews the Standard of the brave Lord  Dowglas  who was killed at the Battle of  Otterburn  falsely as the  Scots  say called  Cheviot Chase  which I have mentioned in  Vol  III just as he had gained the Victory as also the Mace of Iron he fought with  The Country Southeast from  Tweedale  is called  Tiviotdale  or the Shire of  Roxburgh  In which are some Footsteps of  Roman  Encampments and a Military Way runs from  Hounam  to  Tweed  called  the  Roman  Causeway  and vulgarly  the rugged Causeway    The Town and Castle of  Roxburgh  are both now demolished They were famous in the History of both Nations during their mutual Wars when the Town was frequently taken and retaken and in the Siege of which King  James  II of  Scotland  was killed by the bursting of a Gun  Jedburgh  is a Royal Burgh on the River  Jed  It was one of those Towns that suffered in the Rebellion in and being beside in Debt and its Revenue small to answer its Outgoings and it being well situated for manufacturing coarse Wool but greatly suffering for want of fresh Water and  its publick Buildings Bridges Streets and Works greatly out of Repair for these Reasons and also to enable the Inhabitants to erect Workhouses  c  for the Manufacture aforesaid an Act passed imposing a Duty of Twopenies  Scots  upon every Pint of  Scots  Ale  c  to be vended within the said Town and its Liberties and it now reaps the good Effects of it  The Duke of  Roxburgh  has a very great Estate His Grace's House called  Fleurs  has been finely embellished of late Years and is a noble Seat and the Country about it which was formerly wild and rugged is now greatly impaired and cultivated and fine Plantations of Trees and Vista's surround the House  From hence we came to  Kelso  a handsome Markettown upon the Bank of  Tweed  which being so near the  English  Border and having one of the great Roads from  Edinburgh  to  Newcastle  lying thro' it which is a nearer Way by far than by that thro'  Berwick  is a considerable Thoroughfare to  England  They only want a good Bridge over the  Tweed  for at present they have only a Ferry just at the Town and a good Ford thro' the River a little below it  The Country about  Kelso  is very pleasant and fruitful on both Sides the  Tweed  The River here does not part  England  from  Scotland  but you are upon  Scots  Ground for four Miles or thereabouts on the Southside of the  Tweed  and the farther West the more the  Tweed  lies within the Limits of the Country  From  Kelso  we went North where we passed thro'  Lauderdale  a long Valley on both Sides of the little River  Lauder  from whence the Family of  Maitland  first Earls then Dukes and now Earls again took their Title  The Country is good here and fenced with Hills on both Sides The River  Lauder  runs through it keeping its Course due North  The Town of  Lauder  is a Royal Burgh the Seat of the Commissariot and very pleasantly situated 'Tis remarkable for the Execution done upon the Minions of King  James  III who headed by the Earls of  Angus  took them out of the Court and hang'd them over  Lauderbridge  The Seat of the noble Family of  Maitland  Earls of  Lauderdale  is called  Lauderfort  It is a stately House about the Middle of the Valley on the River but not large  We kept the great Road over a high Ridge of Mountains from whence we had a plain View of  MidLothian  One of these Mountains is called  Soutrahill  and belongs to a Branch of the Family of  Maitland  the elder Brother of which House was a Gentleman of great Merit and raised himself by his personal Accomplishments to the highest Posts in the Army At the Battle of  Treves  in  Germany  where the  French  Army under the Mareschal  de Crequi  was defeated by the  Germans  commanded by the old Duke of  Zell  he had the Misfortune to lose one of his Hands which he supplied with another of Steel from whence he was called  Handy Maitland  About the Time of the Union he was LieutenantGeneral of the Queen's Armies Colonel of a Regiment of Foot and Governor of  FortWilliam  and  Inverlochy    I could not pass this Way to  Edinburgh  without going off a little to the Right to see two very fine Seats One of them is an old Abbey belonging to the Marquis of  Lothian  of the antient Name of  Ker  a younger Branch of the House of  Roxburgh  at  Newbottle  whose Predecessor  Mark Ker  being Abbot of it turned Protestant and got it settled on him and his Heirs 'Tis an old Building but finely situated among the most agreeable Walks and Rows of Trees all full grown and contains one of the best chosen Collections of Pictures Statues and Busts in  Scotland    About a Mile from hence is the Duke of  Buccleugh  's House at  Dalkeith  without Exception the finest and largest newbuilt House in  Scotland  It was built by the late Duchess Relict of the Duke of  Monmouth  on the Ground where the old Castle of  Dalkeith  stood which was the Estate of the Great Earl of  Morton  Regent of  Scotland  who was beheaded under King  James  VI by an Engine he himself had introduced into this Country as I have mentioned at  Halifax  in  Vol  III He suffered for being accessory to and acquainted with the barbarous Design of the Lord  Darnley  's Murder  This Palace stands on a rising Ground on the Edge of the River  NorthEsk  from whence it overlooks the Plain with a Majesty like that of  Windsor  on the Bank of the  Thames  making some Allowance for the Difference of the two Rivers The Park is very large and beautified with Waterworks  Jets d' Eau  and a Canal the expensive Work of the late Duchess and the present Duke  The Inside of this magnificent Palace is answerable to the Grandeur of the Family being very richly furnished and adorned with many fine Paintings especially of the Ladies of the  English  Court and some Royal Originals  Just beyond the Park is  Dalkeith  a pretty large Markettown and the more considerable for being so near  Edinburgh  for great Quantities of Provisions are brought hither from the Southern Countries which are sold here and afterwards sent to that City  I will conclude this Letter with the following Inscription on the Tombstone of one  Margaret Scott  who died in the Town of  Dalkeith February    Stop Passenger until my Life you've read  The Living may get Knowledge by the Dead  Five times five Years I liv'd a Virgin Life  Ten times five Years I was a virtuous Wife  Ten times five Years I liv'd a Widow chaste  Now tired of this Mortal Life I rest  I from my Cradle to my Grave have seen  Eight mighty Kings

Gown  An End of  Stuart  's Race I saw No more  I saw my Country sold for  English  Ore  Such Desolations in my Time have been  I have an End of all Perfection seen  I am Sir Yours c  LETTER IV CONTAINING A Description of the antient  Caledonia  or Northern Part of  Scotland  and particularly of the Shires and Towns of  Fife St Andrews Perth Dumblain Alloway Culross Scone Angus Dundee Montrose Aberdeen Buchan Murray Elgin Inverness  and the  Highlands  c  SIR  _I AM now to enter the true and real  Caledonia  for that Part of the Country on the North of the Firth of  Forth  is alone called by that Name and was antiently known by no other  I crossed the River at  Queensferry  seven Miles West of  Edinburgh  into the Shire of  Fife  and as the most considerable Places in this County are on the Seaside or near it I directed my Journey East along the Coast The first Place we came to was the Burgh of  Innerkeithin  an antient walled Town with a spacious Harbour opening from the East into the River which has been lately  much neglected for want of Trade The Town however is large and still populous  I can't pass over a tragical Story which happened in this Town in the Reign of the late Queen  Anne  The Master of  Burleigh  so the eldest Son of a Lord or Viscount is called while the Father is living fell in Love with a young Woman in his Father's Family but could not prevail with her either to marry him or to sacrifice her Virtue to him which being known she was sent away and he persuaded to travel However before his Departure he declared she should be his Wife at his Return and if any one else should marry her in his Absence he would murder him This passed without much Notice and the young Woman was soon after married to a Schoolmaster in this Town  The Gentleman returned and understanding who was her Husband went to his House at Noonday pull'd out a Pistol and shot him dead on the Spot making his Escape unmolested  But a Proclamation being afterwards issued with a Reward of  l  for apprehending him he was at last taken and tried at  Edinburgh  by the Lords of the Justiciary and condemned to have his Head cut off Great Intercession was made to the Queen for his Pardon which proving ineffectual he found means to make his Escape out of the  Tolbooth  of  Edinburgh  disguised in his Sister's Cloaths the Night before he was to have been executed  After that he appeared in the late Rebellion and was in the Battle of  Dumblane  or  Sheriffmuir  but escaped again with his Life tho' his Estate which was but small was forfeited among the rest  Near  Innerkeithin  a little within the Land stands the antient Town of  Dumfermling  which is now in a very ruinous State For Here is a decayed Monastery which before the Reformation was very large but then demolished saving a Part which  was turned into a Parochial Church and even that is now decayed and with it the Monuments of several Kings and Queens of  Scotland  particularly that of  Malcolm  III who founded the Monastery  Here is a decayed Court or Royal Palace of the Kings of  Scotland  but by whom built is uncertain Almost all King  James  the Sixth's Children were born in it particularly King  Charles  I and the Princess  Elizabeth  afterwards Queen of  Bohemia  and his Queen made this Place her particular Residence and had it settled upon her as her Jointure Here she built herself an Apartment over the Arch of the great Gate for her particular Retirement having a Gallery reaching from it to the Royal Lodgings All is now ruinous  Here is a decayed Town the natural Consequence of the Decay of the Palace The Treatment King  Charles  II met with here from the Covenanters was sufficient to make him take a Disgust to the Place  The Church has still a venerable Face and at a Distance seems a mighty Pile the Building being once vastly large What is left appears too heavy for the present Dimensions The Church itself is said to be as long as the Cathedral of  Carlisle  designed by the Model of that at  Glasgow  but I rather think that at  Glasgow  was designed by the Model of this at  Dumfermling  for it seems the most antient  The People are poor but would be poorer if they had not the Manufacture of Linen for their Support the Diaper and better Sort of Linentrade being carried on here and in the neighbouring Towns with more Hands than ordinary The Marquis of  Tweedale  has a great Estate in these Parts and is hereditary Chamberlain or Keeper of the Royal House  The Rocking Stone near  Balvaird  in  Fife  was a remarkable Curiosity It was broken by  Oliver  Cromwell  's Soldiers and then it was discovered that its Motion was performed by an eggshaped Extuberance in the Middle of the under Surface of the upper Stone which was inserted in a Cavity in the Surface of the lower Stone As the lower Stone was flat the upper was globular and not only a just Proportion in the Motion was calculated from the Weight of the Stone and the Wideness of the Cavity as well as the oval Figure of the inserted Prominence but the vast Bulk of the upper Stone absolutely conceal'd the Mechanism of the Motion and the better still to impose on the Vulgar there were two or three surrounding flat Stones tho' that only in the Middle was concerned in the Feat By this pretended Miracle they condemn'd of Perjury or acquitted as their Interest or Affection led them and often brought Criminals to confess what could be no other way extorted from them  From turning East we saw many Seats of private Gentlemen and some of Noblemen particularly one belonging to the Earl of  Morton  at  Aberdour  which fronts the  Firth  to the South and the Grounds belonging to it reach down to the Shore  From this Part of the  Firth  to the Mouth of  Innerkeithin  Harbour is a very good Road for Ships the Water being deep and the Ground good but the Western Part which they call  St Margaret's Bay  is a steep Shore and rocky there being Fathom Water within a Ship's Length of the Rocks So that if a Southeast Wind blows hard it may be dangerous riding in it But this Wind blows so seldom that the Ships often venture it  He that will view the County of  Fife  which is wedg'd in by the  Forth  and the  Tay  and shoots out far into the East must as I said before go round the Coast and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the County which are superior to all the rest and must not be omitted  Kinross    Lessly Falkland Melvil Balgony  and  Cowpar  the last a Town the others great Houses and one  viz Falkland  a Royal Palace and once the most in Request of all the Royal Houses in  Scotland    An  English  Reader will be surprised to hear of such Numbers of Palaces but however mean our Thoughts may be of the  Scots  Court in antient Times their Kings had more fine Palaces than most Princes in  Europe  for in the Time of King  James  IV they had all in good Repair and in Use the several Royal Palaces of  Holyroodhouse  and the Castle at  Edinburgh  the Royal Palace in the Castle at  Sterling Linlithgow Dumfermling Falkland Scone  the Castles of  Dumbarton Blackness  and  Inverness    Besides lesser Seats and Huntinghouses of which King  James  V had several and the several Palaces of Earl  Morton  and others which were forfeited into the King's Hands  The South Coast of the County of  Fife  abounds with Towns and the following Thirteen are Royal Burghs  viz Innerkeithin Bruntisland Kingborn Kirkaldy Dysart Pittenweem Anstruther Wester Anstruther Easter Kilrinny Crail St Andrews  all on the Coast  Dumfermling  and  Cowpar  in the midst of the County And it contains also these other Towns of Note  viz Toryburn Aberdour  the two  Weemys's Levinsmouth Ely St Monan's  and  Newburg on the Tay  And it has in it four Presbyteries  viz  at  Cowpar St Andrews Kirkaldy  and  Dumfermling    The Shire itself takes its Name from  Fyfus  surnamed  Duffus  to whom it was granted by King  Kenneth  II for his Valour against the  Picts  about the Year His Posterity were first called Thanes of  Fife  and afterwards Earls by  Malcolm  II about the Year and endow'd with greater  Privileges than any other Earls of the Kingdom because of their extraordinary Services A famous Monument of which was that called  Clan Macduff's Cross  on the publick Road near  Abernethy  to which if any within the th Degree to the great  Macduff  who was the chief Instrument of subduing the Tyrant  Macbeth  should have recourse in case of Manslaughter he was to be pardon'd on paying a small Number of Cattle This Monument had an Inscription importing those Privileges now worn out and was in such antiquated Terms mixed with Macaronick or half  Latin  Words that few Men now living would have been able to make it out  From this  Macduff  the Families of  Dowglas Weemys  and the Clan  Chattau  are said to be descended The Earl of  Rothes  is hereditary Sheriff of  Fife    Having seen  Aberdour  I took a Turn at a Friend's Invitation to  Lessly  but by the Way stopt at  Kinross  where we had a View of two Things worth noting  First  The famous Lake or Lough called  Lough Leven  in an Island of which stands the Castle where Queen  Mary  commonly known in  England  by the Name of Queen of  Scots  was confined by the first Reformers being first compelled to quit her Favourite  Bothwell  and afterwards her Crown but from which she found means to make her Escape tho' as it prov'd  Out of the Fryingpan into the Fire    The Lough itself is worth seeing 'tis very large being above Miles in Circumference in some Places deep and famous for Fish Formerly it had good Salmon but now chiefly Trouts Perch Pikes and other small Fry out of it flows the River  Leven  which runs from thence to  Lessly    At the Westend of the Lake the Gardens reaching down to the very Water's Edge stands the most beautiful and regular Piece of Architecture  for a private Gentleman's Seat in all  Scotland  I mean the House of  Kinross  belonging to Sir  John Hope Bruce  Bart The Town which has a very good Market and a Street tolerably well built lies at a little Distance from the House so as not to obtrude upon its Privacy and yet so as to be ready to wait upon its Call 'Tis all Beauty the Stone is white and fine the Order regular the Contrivance elegant the Workmanship exquisite  Dryden  's Lines intended for a Compliment on his Friend's Poetry are here literally true  Strong  Dorick  Columns form the Base  Corinthian  fills the upper Space  So all below is  Strength  and all above is  Grace  Sir  William Bruce  the SurveyorGeneral of the Works the  Wren  of  North Britain  was the Founder as well as Architect of this House That Gentleman has left many noble Monuments of his admirable Skill and Taste in those Parts such as the Palace of  Holyrood  at  Edinburgh  the House of  Rothes  and this at  Kinross  besides several others  The Situation of this House of  Kinross  would be disliked by some for its being so very near the Water insomuch that sometimes when the Lake is swelled by Winter Rains and melted Snows it reaches to the very Gardens but as the Country round is dry free from stagnated Boggs and unhealthy Marshes this is of very little Inconvenience if any Sir  William  planted Numbers of Firtrees upon the Land round his House which the present Possessor Sir  John Hope Bruce  is as careful to improve as his Grandfather was to plant Posterity will find the Advantage of this Taste which if it spreads as it has begun will in time make  Scotland  a second  Norway  for Fir for the Lowlands as well as the Highlands will be overspread with Timber  From  Kinross  I came to  Lessly  where I had a full View of the Palace of the Earl of  Rothes  built in the Reign of King  Charles  II by the said Sir  William Bruce    Here it was King  James  II when Duke of  York  lodged most part of the Time when he was obliged by his Brother to retire into  Scotland  and his Apartments are still called the Duke of  York  's Lodgings  The Magnificence of the Inside of this House is unusually great but what is very particular is the long Gallery which is the full Length of one Side of the Building and is filled with Paintings but especially as that is at  Drumlanrig  of the great Ancestors of the House of  Rothes  or  Lessly  at full Lengths and in their Robes of Office  The Rooms of State at  Kinross  are well supply'd with very fine and valuable Pictures many of which are of Princes  c  but most if not all the full Lengths in this Gallery of  Rothes  are of the Family and the immediate Ancestors of the present Earl most of them having been Peers and possessed of the greatest Places of Trust in  Scotland  from the Year to so that you may imagine there may well be enough to furnish a Gallery  Tho' the House is magnificent I cannot say the Situation of it is so advantageous as that of some other Seats for it has no excellent Prospect from the grand Town tho' it stands on the Banks of the  Leven  just where another smaller River joins it  The Park on the Southside is very beautiful six Miles in Circumference walled round and diversified with little Woods of Firtrees which have Vistas reaching thro' them up to the House The Gardens are at the Eastend of the House well designed and planted extending to the Angle where the two Rivers meet so that they are watered on the North and Eastside and on the South are parted  with a Wall from the Park the Westend of them beginning from the House  The Town of  Lessly  seated at a small Distance West from the House or a little Northwest has a good Market but is in no other respect considerable The House aforesaid is the principal Glory of the Place  From  Lessly  we turn'd South to the Coast and came to  Bruntisland  situated in the middle of the Northside of the River  Forth  just opposite to  Leith  so that we have from hence a fair Prospect as well of the Road of  Leith  as of the City and Castle of  Edinburgh  Here is a very commodious Harbour which has no Bar but enters as if it had been made by Hand into the Centre of the Town so that the Ships lie with their broad Sides to the very Houses and it is the common Port of Safety to all Ships that happen to be forced up the Firth by Storms or contrary Winds And Ships trading on this Coast frequently winter here The Water is commonly and at Springtides Feet deep within the Harbour so that it is capable of receiving and careening the largest Men of War The Town is adorned also with a beautiful Church and has a large Townhouse and Gaol But the Harbour having suffered much by Time and by Storms and the Church Townhouse and Gaol becoming ruinous an Act passed  Anno  for laying a Duty of Twopenies  Scots  upon every  Scots  Pint of Beer  c  sold within the Town and Liberties for increasing the Revenues restoring the Harbour and repairing the publick Structures abovementioned  Here is a Manufacture of Linen as there is upon all the Coast of  Fife  and especially for Greencloth as it is called which has been several Years in great Demand in  England  for Printing or Painting in the room of Calicoes which are prohibited there  Next to  Bruntisland  upon the same Coast is  Kinghorn  noted for its Thread Manufacture which the Women chiefly carry on the Men being generally Seamen upon all this Coast as high as the  Queen'sFerry    Great Numbers of Porpoises are seen almost constantly in this Firth which the Men make a Practice of shooting and then bring on Shore and boil their Fat into Train Oil as they do Whales and several other great Fish which they sometimes meet with thereabout But the  Firth  affords a much more regular Fishingtrade lower down of which in its Place  The Ferry from  Leith  to the Shore of  Fife  is fixed in  Kinghorn  which is of considerable Advantage to it tho' sometimes the Boats by Stress of Weather are driven into  Bruntisland    East of this Town is  Kirkcaldy  a larger more populous and betterbuilt Town than the other and indeed than any on this Coast It consists chiefly of one Street running along the Shore from East to West a full Mile very well built It has some considerable Merchants in it in the most extensive Sense of the Word besides others that deal very largely in Corn exporting great Quantities of it both to  England  and  Holland  Others again trade in Linen to  England  who in Return bring back all needful Supplies of foreign Manufactures  Here are several Coalpits not only in the Neighbourhood but even close to the very Sea at the Westend of the Town and where one would think the Tide should make it impossible to work them At the Eastend of the Town is a convenient Yard for building and repairing of Ships and farther on several Saltpans for boiling and making Salt  Dysert  boasts as I said of being a Royal Burgh but notwithstanding it is a very decaying Corporation the only Support of it is that the Lord  Dysert  the Landlord has a good Saltwork here and in the Lands adjoining an excellent Vein of  Scotch  Coal both which are easily put on Shipboard at a small Wharf adjoining This I think is the whole Trade of the Town except what arises from a few Nailmakers and Hardware Workers  I take the Decay of most of these Seaport Towns which 'tis evident have made a much better Figure in former Times to be owing to the removing of the Court and Nobility of  Scotland  to  England  which has been doing ever since the Junction of the Kingdoms under the same Prince in  James  I and VI and more completely by the Union Their Seaport Towns had before a Trade when their Court was magnificent when their Nobility built fine Houses and lived in them They then exported Goods infinitely more in Value than what they received and therefore the Balance was evidently on their Side whereas now the Union has open'd a Door to all the  English  Manufactures and suppressed many of the  Scots  has prohibited their Wool going abroad and yet scarcely takes it off at home If the Cattle are sent to  England  the Money is too generally spent there likewise The Troops raised here are in  English  Service and  Scotland  receives no Premium for the Levies which she might have done had they been sent abroad as the  Swiss  and other Nations do at this time  But the Benefits that will attend its principal Ports on the Repairs of their Harbour and publick Structures by the many Acts already passed and every Session of Parliament passing by the Twopenies  Scots  levied for those Purposes will in time very probably turn the Scale in favour of the Union and increase the Trade of this Part of the United Kingdom as by virtue of that Act it stands on the same foot of Advantage with  England  and has so many good Ports to receive Shipping and carry on a Commerce with  foreign Parts as well as Coastwise to  England  and  Ireland  Of this the Towns of  Glasgow Dundee Dumfries Irvin Dunbar Pittenweem Montrose Inverness Elgin Aberbrothock Bruntisland Lanark Linlithgow  c will bear Testimony as I have and shall observe in their proper Places Indeed 'tis pity but  Scotland  should find its Account in this respect in general for it must be own'd as I have in part observed before that it has a plentiful Product for Exportation and were the Issue of that Product returned and consumed at home it must necessarily grow rich and flourish  To take only a short View of the Commodities it exports into foreign Countries  England  included for I am now considering  Scotland  as if not united  Carried to  England  Corn Black Cattle Sheep Wool Linen of several Sorts some Woolen Manufactures Stockens in particular  To  Holland Bremen  and  Hamburgh  Corn Lead Salt Coal barrell'd Pork and Salmon  Note The  Dutch  buy the barrell'd Pork from  Aberdeen  for Victualling their  EastIndia  Ships it being much better cured than that from any other Country  To  Norway  Salt Oatmeal Salmon Lead Stockens and Linen  To  Sweden Dantzick  and  Riga  Salt Woolen Manufactures of  Sterling  and  Aberdeen    To  Spain  and the  Streights  Herrings pickled barrell'd and dry'd Salmon Herrings and Whitefish  To  France  Coal Salt Lead Herrings Whitefish and Wool  For all these Exportations the Returns are or at least were before the Union  From  England  Pewter Blocktin Wrought Iron Glass Ware Sugars Tobacco Drugs and Dyers Stuffs  All the  English  Woolen and Silk Manufactures were prohibited upon the severest Penalties so that the Returns from  England  in Goods were very small the grand Return from thence was in Specie And 'tis known that above an Hundred Thousand Pounds was paid into  Scotland  every Year for Cattle only  From  Holland  some fine Linens but not much because of their own Lace and fine Threads Gimp Incle  c EastIndia  Goods Linseed and Lint or Flax Linseedoil Trainoil and Whalebone  From  Norway  Pitch and Tar Deals and Firr Timber  From  Sweden  Iron in Bars and Copper Deals and Timber  From  Dantzick Koningsberg Riga Narva  and  Petersburg  Plank call'd East Country Clapboard or Wainscot Oak Timber and in Quarters Hemp Pitch Tar Turpentine Sturgeon and Flax  From  France  Wine Brandy Apples Rennets Resin Cork Paper Wrought Silks Raw Silks Toys Perfumes  c  From the Royal Canal thro'  France  Oil and  Italian  Pickles from  Leghorn    From  Hamburgh  Staves for Casks Clapboard  Rhenish  Wine and Old Hock  All these Sorts of Goods are returned into  Scotland  but the Quantities are very small The chief Articles to sum up all in a little are  From  England  Sugar and Tobacco from  France  Wine and Brandy from the East Country Naval Stores from  Sweden  Iron and Copper from  Norway  Deals and Timber from  Holland  Lint and Linseed  Now these put together if I am rightly informed do not balance the Lead Coal and Salt which they export every Year So that the Balance of Trade must stand greatly to the Credit of the  Scots  Account which would be all returned into  Scotland  in  Specie  every Year if there was not a neighbouring Gulph into which it is all sunk And what a Figure would such an Advantage of running Cash be able to make  I have already touched upon the Advantages that will probably accrue to  Scotland  by the Method they have fallen upon of augmenting and repairing their Ports and Harbours by virtue of the Twopenies Tax and some will further add to balance the Disadvantages they lie under from the Union that it is now establish'd in a lasting Tranquillity and an End put to those Wars that used to lay waste the Borders of both Nations that this will give Encouragement to the Improvement of the Land and consequently of raising the Value of Estates that the Taxes are easy and ascertained that the Charges of defending the Country both Abroad and at Home lie upon  England  and the  WestIndia  Trade abundantly pours in Wealth upon her And all this is true but is it not Pity for all that that her own Nobility should not like true Patriots lend a helping Hand to the rising Advantage of their own Country and spend some of the large Sums they get in  England  in erecting Manufactures employing the Poor and propagating the Trade at Home which they may see plainly has made their united Neighbours of  England  so much exceed them  But to return to our Travels We came next to a Village called the  WesterWemys  belonging to the Earl of  Wemys  whose House stands a little farther East on the Top of a high Cliff with its Front looking down upon the Sea At the Westend of this Cliff is a small Plain once a Bowlinggreen where the late Earl being Admiral had some small Fieldpieces planted to answer Salutes Behind the House is a small and irregular Courtyard with two Wings of Building being Offices to the House on one Side and Stables on the other Gardens there are none only a large wellplanted Orchard between  which and the House the Road goes on to  EasterWemys    From thence you come to another Village called  Buckhaven  inhabited by Fishermen who are employ'd wholly in catching fresh Fish every Day in the  Firth  and carrying them to  Leith  and  Edinburgh  Markets The Buildings are but a miserable Row of Cottages yet there is scarce a poor Man in it but they are in general so very clownish that to  be of the College of  Buckhaven is become a Proverb  Here we saw the Shore of the Sea covered with Shrimps like a thin Snow and as you rode among them they would rise like a kind of Dust and hop like Grashoppers being scared by the Footing of the Horse  The Fishermen of this Town have a great many Boats of all Sizes which lie upon the Beach unrigged ready to be fitted out every Year for the Herring Season in which they have a very great Share  Beyond this is the  Ely  a little Town but a very safe and good Harbour firmly built of Stone almost like the  Cobb  at  Lime  tho' not projecting into the Sea so much as that It stands a little on the Westside of the Mouth of the  Leven  the Salmon of which River are esteemed the best in this Part of  Scotland    To this Town the Earl of  Wemys  brings his Coal which he digs about two Miles off on the Banks of the River  Leven  as also what little Salt he can make The Coalworks are greatly prejudiced by the breaking in of the Water notwithstanding the immense Charges they have been at to prevent that Inconvenience  The People who work in the Coal Mines in this Country partly from their Poverty and hard Labour and partly from the black Hue which they get from the Coal make such a frightful Appearance  that their own Countryman  Drumond  of  Hawthornden  in his famous Macaronick Poem called  PolemoMiddinia  thus describes them  Coalehewers  Nigri  Girnantes more  Divelli  From hence we have several small Towns on the Coast as  Criel  or  Crail Anstruther  or  Anster  as 'tis usually called also the Port of  Pittenweem  these are all Royal Burghs  Pittenweem  is a Port and Harbour very conveniently situated near the Mouth of the  Forth  in the Shire of  Fife  and great Quantities of Herring Cod and other Fish are taken here But it has had two great Difficulties to encounter with that is to say the low Situation of the Town close on the Harbour by which means the Inhabitants were at a great and constant Expence beyond their Ability to maintain a Pier and other Works to defend both the Shipping and its People The other that the Entrance was very narrow and strait and several Rocks lay in the Way of the Shipping which was a great Hindrance to its Trade and Commerce But in the Year an Act passed for laying a Duty of Twopenies  Scots  upon every  Scots  Pint of Ale  c  sold within the Town and its Liberties for remedying these Inconveniences  Overagainst this Shore and in the Mouth of the  Forth  opposite to the Isle of the  Bass  lies the Isle of  May  known to Mariners by a Lighthouse upon it The only constant Inhabitant is said to be the Man maintained there by the Government to take care of the Fire in the Lighthouse It was famous in former Times for barren Women going to St  Adrian  's Shrine there  Here the  French  Fleet lay with some Assurance with the  Pretender  on board in when the  English  Squadron approaching the Four o'clock Gun gave the Alarm upon which they immediately  weighed got under Sail and made the best of their Way the  English  pursuing in vain  The Shore of the  Firth  or  Frith  ends here and the  Aestuarium  or Mouth opening the Land of  Fife  falls off to the North making a Promontory of Land which the Seamen call  Fifeness  looking East on the  German  Ocean after which the Coast bends away North and the first Town you come to is  St Andrew  's an antient and once flourishing City the Metropolis of all  Scotland  and the Seat of the first University and before the Revolution an Archbishop's See  It is remarkable for a fine Situation surrounded with extensive Cornfields abounding in excellent Wheat and Barley and the pleasant Downs called the  Links  lying on the Seaside towards the North The famous Physician  Cardan  esteemed it the healthiest Town he ever lived in having Occasion to experience it some Months when he came over from  Italy  at the Request of the Pope to prescribe to Archbishop  John Hamilton  whom he recovered of a Consumption And twenty Years before it had the Approbation of the most eminent Physicians of the Country when a House was fitted up here for the Reception of  Magdalen  Daughter of  Francis  King of  France  who married  James  V King of  Scotland  in but that Lady died shortly after her Arrival at  Holyroodhouse  in  Edinburgh  and never reached  St Andrews    The Town of old consisted of four large Streets lying from East to West almost parallel to one another The Northermost of the four called  Swallowstreet  tho' formerly the principal is now totally ruined not so much as one House remaining The other three by their Regularity do not seem to have been a fortuitous Concourse of Houses as most of the other Towns of this Country do all of them terminating Eastward at the Cathedral which look  upon each other and seem to lament their decaying Condition For tho' the Town was heretofore about two Miles in Circumference there remain now hardly Houses and of those near are become ruinous and not habitable The Number of Inhabitants still amount to above but many of them have nothing to do there being neither Trade nor Manufactures in the Place tho' at the same time it has a Harbour but capable only of small Vessels Near the Town is plenty of Freestone of which all the Houses are built  Before the Reformation this City was crouded both on account of Trade and Religion Pilgrims coming hither in great Numbers to visit the Relicks of St  Andrew  said to be brought over by St  Regulus  about the End of the fourth Century from  Patras  in  Greece  where that Apostle suffered Martyrdom Here were three religious Houses a  Franciscan Dominican  and  Augustine  Priory the last founded by  Robert  Bishop of St  Andrews  who died and was established upon some of the Revenues formerly belonging to the antient  Culdees  of this Place  James Stewart  afterwards Earl of  Murray  and Regent of  Scotland  was in his younger Days Prior of it This Monastery was more like the magnificent Palace of a Prince than a Convent of Monks professing Poverty as appears still by its Ruins and particularly by the Wall that encompassed it of fine hewn Stone with many Battlements and Turrets  Here is now only one Parish Church that of the  Holy Trinity  remaining but there are two others which are rather Chapels one to  St Salvator's  College of which however no Use is made it having no Endowment and the Provost of that College being often a Layman even in a Presbyterian Sense The other is the Chapel belonging to  St Leonard's  College the Provost whereof must be a Minister  The Church of the  Holy Trinity  is an antient and stately Edifice built with fine Freestone in form of a Cross and has at the Westend a handsome Spire in good Repair In it is a fine Monument of Archbishop  Sharpe  who was assassinated upon a Moor as he was coming Home in his Coach It was erected by the Archbishop's Son Sir  William Sharpe  Bart who to secure it from the Fate he feared it might be liable to mortified Merks to the City of  St Andrews  to keep it in constant Repair which has had its intended Effect for the Magistrates are very careful of it and would be very severe upon any who should attempt to deface it  On the Northside of the Town was the old Castle of which now nothing is remaining but the Walls built by  Roger  Bishop of  St Andrews  who died being the second Son of  Robert Beaumont  Earl of  Leicester  and Chancellor of  Scotland  It was repaired by Cardinal  Bethune  and Archbp  Hamilton  the former of whom procured  George Wishart  to be burnt here in the Parade while from his Window he glutted his Eyes with so horrid a Spectacle but was himself afterwards assassinated in the same Place to revenge whose Death the Queen Regent permitted it to be attacked by the  French  from whom it suffered greatly But at the Reformation it suffered more and its Ruin has been completed since the Revolution  To the East of the Castle are the Ruins of the stately Cathedral founded by Bishop  Arnold  who died and finished by Bishop  Lambertoun  who died It was in Length from East to West Feet and the Cross from South to North its Breadth and its Heighth Feet tho' some draw another kind of Ichnography and make it seven Feet longer and two broader than  St Peter's  at  Rome  and for the Height as well as the Beauty of its Pillars and the Symmetry and Proportion of  the Whole it was one of the best  Gothick  Structures in the World  It was sometimes called  Killrimont  from the Church built by  Hergust  King of the  Picts  in the fourth Century but the Name of  St Andrews  has prevailed for many Ages The Cathedral was near demolished at the Reformation but was repaired in some measure by the succeeding Archbishops but since the Revolution it has been intirely in Ruins as we now see it  Near the Ruins of the Cathedral are still remaining the Walls of the most antient Chapel of  St Rule  with the great square Spire still very intire It is in Height Feet and made of such large and durable Stones that tho' it was built so many Ages ago yet so little has it suffered by the Injuries of the Weather that a small Sum would save it from falling for many Ages to come And as this is probably one of the most antient Monuments of Christianity in  Great Britain  it is Pity it should go to Ruin for want of a suitable Reparation This besides would be the most proper Chapel and Chapterhouse for the noble Knights of the most antient Order of the Thistle since under the Patronage of the Apostle St  Andrew  whose Relicks were preserved at this Place that Order of Knighthood had its Rise and Foundation and by King  James  VII's Letters Patents reviving and restoring this noble Order which were dated at  Windsor  the th of  May  it appears the Knights of the  Thistle  or St  Andrew  formerly held their Chapters in the great Church of  St Andrews  which being demolished his said Majesty ordered them for the future to be kept at the Chapel Royal of  Holyroodhouse    This City is famous particularly for its University consisting of three Colleges founded by  Henry Wardlaw  Bishop of  St Andrews  in the Year It obtained very ample Privileges and Immunities  from Pope  Benedict  XIII which were afterwards confirmed to them by King  James  I of  Scotland  and by several other succeeding Kings During Episcopacy the Archbishops were Chancellors of it The Rector is chosen yearly and by the Statutes ought to be one of the Principals of the three Colleges here called  St Salvator's St Leonard's  and the  New College    St Salvator's  College was founded by  James Kennedy  Bishop of  St Andrews Anno  who erected the Edifice furnished it with costly Ornaments and endowed it with sufficient Revenues for a Doctor a Batchelor and Licentiate of Divinity four Professors of Philosophy and eight poor Scholars The Earl of  Cassils  settled a Maintenance for a Professor of Philosophy It has a good Library founded by Dr  Sheen  The Edifice itself is a most stately Pile of fine hewn Stone has a large vaulted Chapel covered with Freestone and over it is a very lofty Spire The common Hall and Schools are vastly large and the Cloisters and private Lodgings for Masters and Scholars have been very magnificent and convenient but the Fabrick is of late become very much out of Repair nor is the College Revenue able to support it  St Leonard's  College was founded by  John Hepburne  Prior of  St Andrews  in the Reign of King  James  V with Salaries for a Principal or Warden four Professors of Philosophy and eight poor Scholars A Professor of Philology was added by Sir  John Scot  of  Scotstarvet  with a liberal Salary He also augmented the Library very considerably and Sir  John Wedderburn  at his Death left a great Collection of Books to it  Fordun's  MS of the  Scotish  History is in this Library  The  New College  was founded by Archbishop  Bethune  Uncle to the Cardinal of that Name with Endowments for a Principal and Professor of  Divinity and some Students in the same Faculty for no Philosophy is taught in this College  These last two Colleges having a better Revenue to support them than that of  St Salvator  are in much better Repair In the latter King  Charles  I held a Parliament in a large spacious Room able to seat Persons in regular Order and it still retains the Name of the  Parliament Room    A Professor of Mathematicks was of late Years added to this University as was also not long since a Professor of Medicine with a handsome Endowment by his Grace  James  Duke of  Chandos  whom the University upon the Death of the Duke of  Athol  in Gratitude chose to be their Chancellor which Office is during Life and to that alone and that of his ViceChancellor belongs the conferring of all University Degrees  Mr  James Gregory  Professor of Mathematicks in this University famous for his Knowledge in that Science has erected in the College Gardens a commodious Observatory and furnished it with good Mathematical Instruments  It has produced many learned Men among others the famous Lord  Napier  who invented the Logarithms Sir  Robert Murray  Sir  Andrew Balfour  and the great Lawyer Sir  George Mackenzie    The Harbour here has suffered so much by the Encroachments of the Sea that I fear it will never be sufficiently repaired The Pier is founded upon a Rock of Freestone in Length about Feet but this Rock extends itself into the Sea Feet further on the Point of which stands a Beacon and the great Rolling of the Sea breaking over the Rock between the Pierend and this Beacon makes the Harbour very dangerous In the Year it was proposed to be repaired and the Pier carried as far as the Beacon and a Brief was granted for that  Purpose But the Collections were too small to make any great Advances  By all we have said it will appear that this antient City and its University too are in a very declining State The Archbishop's Seat and Ecclesiastical Courts kept there beside the great Resort of Pilgrims to the Convents brought great Business thither which being now disused and one new College erected at  Edinburgh  and another at  Aberdeen  contribute much to the Decay of both The City enjoys still some Privileges by the original Charter yet extant whereby it was incorporated by King  David Anno    From  St Andrews  we proceeded on to two very agreeable Seats belonging to the present Earl of  Leven  one called  Melvil  and the other  Balgony Melvil  is a regular and beautiful Building after the Model of Sir  William Bruce  's House at  Kinross  described before  Balgony  is an antient Seat formerly belonging to the Family of  Lessly  and if not built was inlarged and repaired by General  Alexander Lessly  noted for his Services in  Germany  under  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  and at last against King  Charles  I  The River  Leven  runs hard by the Walls of the House and makes the Situation very pleasant The Park is large but not well planted at least the Trees do not thrive  From hence we went North to  Cowpar  the Shire Town and turned to the Northeast Part of the Country to see the Ruins of the famous Monastery of  Balmerinoch  of which Mr  Camden  takes Notice but we saw nothing worth our Observation the very Ruins being almost eaten up by Time The Monastery was founded by Queen  Ermengred  Wife of King  William  of  Scotland    Hence we came to the Bank of another  Firth  called the  Firth  of  Tay  which opening to a large  Breadth at its Entrance as the  Firth  of  Edinburgh  does draws in afterwards as that does at the  Queen'sferry  and makes a Ferry over at the Breadth of two Miles to the Town of  Dundee  and then the  Firth  widening again just as that of the  Forth  does also continues its Breadth from four to six Miles till it comes almost to  Perth  as the other does to  Sterling    This River  Tay  is without Exception the largest River in  Scotland  tho' not of the longest Course for it rises out of the Mountains near the Edge of  Argyllshire  and running first North into the District of  Braidalbin  there receiving many other Rivers spreads itself into a large Lake called  Lough Tay  extending near Miles in Length and traversing the very Heart of  Scotland  comes into the Sea near this Place Now as I design to keep in this Part of my Work to the East Coast of the Country I must for the present quit the  Tay  keeping a little on the hither Side of it and go back to that Part of the Country which lies to the South and East of  Dumbarton  or  Lenoxshire  so drawing an imaginary Line from  Sterlingbridge  due North thro' the Heart of the Country to  Inverness  which I take to lie almost due North and South  In this Course I moved from the Ferry mentioned above to  Perth  lying upon the same  Tay  but on the hither Bank It was formerly called  Johnston  or  St John's Town  from an old Church dedicated to the Evangelist St  John  which is still remaining and so big as to make two Parochial Churches and can serve the whole Town for their publick Worship  Perth  is the second Town of  Scotland  for Dignity Near it stood antiently the Town of  Berth  which being overflowed by an Inundation of the  Tay  occasioned the building of this where it now stands  The chief Business of this Town at present is the Linen Manufacture which is so considerable here that all the neighbouring Country is employed in it  and it is the Wealth of the whole Place The  Tay  is navigable up to the Town for Ships of good Burden and they ship off here vast Quantities of Linen for  England    The Salmon taken here and all over the  Tay  are extremely good and the Quantity prodigious They carry them to  Edinburgh  and to all the Towns where they have no Salmon and barrel up great Quantities for Exportation The Merchants of this Town have also a considerable Trade to the  Baltick  and  Norway    This Town was for some time the Seat of the late Rebellion but by a peculiar Felicity the Townsmen got so much Money by both Parties that they have ever since been enriched by it as appears not only from particular Families but from the publick and private Buildings which they have raised since that time particularly a new  Tolbooth  or  Townhall    It will seem a little strange to us in the South that any Place should be enriched by a Rebellion but a few Words will explain it It must be observed that the  Pretender  and his Troops having their Quarters hereabouts a considerable time occasioned a great Consumption of Victuals and Drink which are so plentiful in these Parts that 'tis frequent for Towns to petition the Government to have Regiments of Soldiers quarter'd upon them tho' in  England  nothing gives greater Uneasiness  Again as the  Pretender  was here and at  Scone  it occasioned a great Confluence of Persons of Note who gathered about him waiting the Issue of his Fortunes till they found the Storm gathering from the South and no probable Means to resist it and then they shifted off as they could  While they resided here Lodgings in the Town lett at such a Rate as was never known before Provisions were dear Trade brisk and had it lasted two or three Months longer it would have made all the Towns rich in the Neighbourhood  When this Cloud was dispersed the Victors enter'd new Officers succeeded the routed Party Still the Head Quarters were here and afterwards the  Dutch  Troops continued here most Part of the Winter All this while the Money flowed in and the Town made their Market on both Sides they were Gainers even by War and Foreigners  The Linen Trade which we have mentioned before has mightily increased since the Act of Parliament in  England  for suppressing the Use of printed Calicoes in the room of which  Scotch  and  Irish  Linens have been bought and printed in  England  So that the Worsted and Silk Weavers in  London  seem to have had very little Benefit by the Act  At  Ardock  in  Perthshire  are the Remains of a  Roman  Camp and near  Perth  is a  Roman  Way where several Medals sepulchral Urns and other Monuments of Antiquity have been found  From  Perth  I went South to that Part which they call  Clackmanan  lying West from  Dumfermling  and extending itself towards  Sterling  and  Dumblain  none of which Part I had gone over before  Northeastward from  Perth  to  Brechen  lies a Vale which they call  Strathmore  esteemed the most fruitful in Corn of all that Part of the Country Here are a great many Gentlemens Seats tho' on the Northside of the  Tay  particularly the noble Palace of  Glames  the Hereditary Seat of the Family of  Lyon  Earls of  Strathmore  The Heir in Reversion now enjoys the Title and Estate tho' it very narrowly escaped being forfeited for the elder Brother entertained here the  Pretender  very magnificently making up for him and his Retinue fourscore and eight Beds and afterwards espoused his Cause so strenuously that he lost his Life in his Service at the Battle of  Sheriffmuir  The Estate being entailed descended to the second Son or younger Brother who is now Earl of  Strathmore    It is one of the finest oldbuilt Palaces in  Scotland  and by far the largest When you see it at a Distance it is so full of Turrets and lofty Buildings Spires and Towers some plain others shining with gilded Tops that it looks not like a Town but a City and the Appearances seen thro' the long Vista's of the Park are so different that you would not think it the same House any two Ways together  The great Avenue is a full half Mile planted on either Side with several Rows of Trees When you come to the outer Gate you are surprised with the Beauty and Variety of the Statues and Busts some of Stone some of Brass some gilded some plain The Statues in Brass are four one of King  James  VI one of King  Charles  I booted and spurred as if going to take Horse at the Head of his Army one of King  Charles  II habited like that in the  Royal Exchange London  and one of King  James  VII after the Pattern of that which is at  Whitehall    From hence I came away Southwest and crossing the  Tay  below  Perth  but above  Dundee  came at last to  Dumblain  a Town pleasantly situated on the Banks of the River  Allan  but without any sort of Trade It contains the Ruins of a Church of excellent Workmanship but within our own Memory it was made famous by the Battle fought between the Army of King  George  I under the Command of the Duke of  Argyll  and the  Pretender  's Forces under the Earl of  Mar  on  Sheriffmuir  between this Place and  Sterling  We took a full View of the Field of Battle and could not but reflect with Surprize that a Rabble of  Highlanders  appearing in Rebellion armed in Haste and headed by a Person of no Experience in War should come so near to the overthrowing an Army of regular disciplined Troops and led on by experienced Officers and so great a General  From hence I proceeded on in Sight of  Sterlingbridge  but leaving it on the Righthand turned away East to  Alloway  where the Earl of  Mar  had a noble Seat and where the Navigation of the  Firth  of  Forth  begins This is as I hinted before within four Miles of  Sterling  by Land and scarcely within by Water occasioned by those uncommon Meanders and Reaches in the River which gives so beautiful a Prospect from the Castle of  Sterling    This fine Seat was formerly called the Castle of  Alloway  but is now so completely modernized that no Appearance of a Castle remains  The Gardens of  Alloway  House are by much the finest in  Scotland  and not outdone by any in  England  consisting of above Acres of Ground and the adjoining Wood which is adapted to the House in Avenues and Vistas above three times as much  Here is a Harbour where Ships of Burden safely ride The  Glasgow  Merchants have erected Warehouses to which they bring their Tobacco and Sugars by Land and then ship them for  Holland  or  Hamburgh  or the  Baltick  or  England  as they find the Market  The Highstreet of  Alloway  reaches down to this Harbour and is a very spacious wellbuilt Street with Rows of Trees finely planted all the Way Here are several Testimonies of the Goodness of their Trade as particularly a large Dealyard or Place for laying up all Sorts of  Norway  Goods which shews that they have a Commerce thither They have large Warehouses of naval Stores such as Pitch Tar Hemp Flax two sawing Mills for cutting or slitting of Deals and a Ropewalk for making all Sorts of Ropes and Cables for rigging and fitting Ships with several other Things which convinces us they are no Strangers to other Trades as well by Sea as Land  East from  Alloway  is a small County called  Clackmannanshire  from the Head Burgh and is Part of  Fife  The Country is plain the Soil fertile most of it proper for Pasture and what lies below the  Orchilhills  producing Corn very well But the Shire is chiefly known for yielding the best of Coal and the greatest Quantity of it of any Country of  Scotland  so that it is carried not only to  Edinburgh  but also to  England Holland  and  France  But while the Freight from  Scotland  is so dear and the Tax in  England  so heavy the Price of these Coals must always be so high at  London  as will not fail to restrain the Consumption  On this Shore of the  Firth  farther down stands the neat and agreeable Town of  Culross  lying in Length by the Waterside like  Kirkaldy  being likewise a Trading Town as Trade must be understood in  Scotland  Here is a pretty Market a plentiful Country behind it and the navigable  Firth  before it The Coal the Linen Manufacture and Plenty of Corn will always keep something of Trade alive upon the whole Coast  Here is a very noble Seat belonging to the  Bruces  Earls of  Kincairn  and is well worth a Traveller's Notice and indeed these Instances of Magnificence are so frequent in  Scotland  that were we to dwell upon each of them such of our Readers as know nothing of  Scotland  would be apt to think we were too partial in its Favour But it is certain that no Gentry or Nobility in the World exceeded the  Scots  while an independent Kingdom in noble Houses and all manner of Magnificence as their Families for Antiquity of Descent hardly have any Equals in any one Country on Earth  Culross  is a Royal Burgh in the Shire of  Perth  but in the Confines of  Fife  famous for a Branch of the Iron Manufacture in making Girdles  i e  broad round Plates on which they bake their oaten Cakes  They told me of Mines of Copper and of Lead lately discovered in  Fife  and of Silver also But I could not learn that any of them were actually wrought It is however not improbable but that there are such Mines and particularly the two  Lomons  which are remarkable Mountains in this Shire seem to promise Metal in their Bowels if they were thoroughly searched They rise up like two Sugarloaves in the Middle of a plain Country not far from  Falkland  and give a View of the  Firth  of  Edinburgh  South and the  Firth  of  Tay  North and are seen from  Edinburgh  very plain  Having made this little Excursion to the South from  Perth  you may suppose me now returned Northward again and we proceeded to  Scone  that antient Seat of Royal Ceremony where almost all the Kings of  Scotland  were crowned since the Conquest of the  Picts    The celebrated Wooden Chair with the Stone in it was brought away from hence as is well known by the victorious King  Edward  I and placed in  WestminsterAbbey  where it now is but the  Scotish  Royal Blood succeeding to the  English  Crown in the Person of King  James  I of  England  and VI of  Scotland  verify'd the following prophetick Distich tho' at the Time it was accounted no small Loss and Disgrace to the Kingdom The Lines were these  Ni fallat Fatum Scoti quocunque locatum  Invenient Lapidem regnare tenentur ibidem  Thus translated by the  Scots  Unless old Prophets fail and Wizards Wit decay  Wheree'er this Stone is found the  Scots  shall reign for ay  It is said to have been first dignified by K  Kenneth  who having fought a bloody Battle here with the  Picts  in which he gave them a great Overthrow sat down to rest him upon this Stone after he had  been tired with the Slaughter of the Enemy upon which his Nobles came round him to congratulate his Success and in Honour to his Valour crowned him with a Garland of Victory from whence he dedicated the Stone to the Coronation of all the future Kings of  Scotland  hoping from this Omen that they should like him be victorious over all their Enemies  But the better Sort of  Scots  Historians say their Kings brought it from  Ireland  into  IColmKill  in the Isles and from thence to  Scone  or  Scoon  when they had subdued the  Picts    The Palace of  Scoon  tho' antient is not so much decay'd as those I have already spoken of and the  Pretender  found it very well in Repair for his Use Here he lived and kept his Court in all the State and Appearance of a Sovereign but it was a shortlived Splendor for in Days he was obliged to quit the Kingdom by the Advance of the Royal Army In this Palace is the longest Gallery in  Scotland  and the Ceiling painted but the Painting very old  The Building is large the Front being above Feet it has two extraordinary fine square Courts besides others which contain the Offices Outhouses  c  The Royal Apartments are spacious and large but the whole Building is intirely after the antient Manner  From  Scoon  to  Dunkeld  is so little a Way that we could not help visiting it being the Place where a Skirmish was fought between the Forces of King  William  after the Revolution and some of the Viscount of  Dundee  's Men who pursued the King's Forces as they were obliged to retire from  Gillicranky  after Lord  Dundee  himself had been killed there The Duke of  Athol  has a noble old House here in one of the Courts of which that Part of the Action happened  Here was formerly a beautiful and magnificent Cathedral Church dedicated to St  Columba  the Seat of a Bishop whose Chapter or Prebendaries were  Culdees  or  Black Monks  but they are now dissolved and most Part of the Church in Ruins  Dunkeld  is the chief Markettown of the  Highlands  and supposed to have been formerly the chief Town of  Caledonia  It is situated on the Northside of the  Tay  at the Foot of the  Grampian  Hills and is surrounded with pleasant Woods  Upon the River  Tay  also lies  Errol  the Seat of the Earl of that Name chief of the antient Family of  Hay  who derive their Origin from a famous Peasant who in the Reign of  Kenneth  III being at Plough with his two Sons and perceiving the  Scots  fleeing before the  Danes  he and his two Sons stopt their Flight renew'd the Battle and gained the Victory for which they had the Lands of  Errol  bestowed upon them and the Family Arms is three bloody Shields supported by two naked Men with Yokes in Remembrance of this famous Victory the Father and two Sons having no other Weapons when they put themselves at the Head of the flying  Scots  but the Yokes they took from their Ploughs Of this Family are besides the Earls of  Errol  the Marquis of  Tweedale  the Earl of  Kinnoul  c  But our determined Rout lay up the Eastern Shore and thro' the Shires adjacent on that Side as particularly  Angus Mearns Marr Aberdeen Buchan  and so as I laid it out before to  Inverness    Mr  Camden  tells us That the  Firth  of  Tay  was the utmost Boundary of the  Roman  Empire in  Britain  That  Julius Agricola  the best of Generals under  Domitian  the worst of Emperors tho' he pierced farther and traversed by Land into the Heart of the  Highlands  yet seeing no End of a barbarous Country and no Advantage by the Conquest of it withdrew and here fixed the  Roman  Eagles that he  frequently harassed the  Picts  by Excursions and Inroads but always returned to his Post here making the  Tay  his Frontier  But our  English Caesars  have outgone the  Romans  for  Edward  I as is said before passed the  Tay  and rifled the Abbey at  Scoon  and if we may believe History penetrated into the remotest Parts which however I take to be only the remotest Parts of what was then known to the  English  for as to the  Highlands  the Mountains of  Loquhaber Ross Murray Sutherland  and  Caithness  we read nothing of them From these Retreats the  Scots  always returned  Antaeus  like with double Strength after every Defeat till in the next Reign they overthrew his Successor  Edward  II at  Bannockbourn  and drove the  English  out of the whole Country following them over  Tweed  into  England  and ravaging the Counties of  Northumberland  and  Cumberland    Oliver Cromwell  indeed according to the Motto of a noble House in  Scotland Rode Through  penetrated to the remotest Part of the Island and that he might even literally rule it with a Rod of Iron built Citadels and Forts in all the Angles and Extremes where he found it needful to place his stationary Legions just as the  Romans  did as at  Leith  at  St Andrew's  at  Inverness Perth Aire  and several other Places We have since seen the Forces of King  George  I making the same Rout nay ferrying over into the Western and Northwestern Islands here again imitating the Prudence of the old  Romans  who employ'd their Soldiery in mending Roads and making Causeways over Mountains that were before thought inaccessible  Where Armies have marched there's Room enough no doubt for Travellers With this Assurance therefore we chearfully crossed the  Tay    We left  Strathern  with the little Country of  Menteith  for our Return and went down into  Angus  to  Dundee  a pleasant large populous City which as it stands well for Trade so it has as large a Share of it as most Towns in  Scotland  and that as well Foreign as Domestick  It is exceeding populous full of stately Houses and large handsome Streets particularly four very good ones with a large Marketplace in the Middle the largest and fairest in  Scotland  except that of  Aberdeen    The Inhabitants have a very large Correspondence with  England  and ship off a great deal of Linen thither and a great Quantity of Corn is sent from hence to  England  as well as to  Holland  They have likewise a good Share of the  Norway  Trade and as they are concerned in the Herring Fishery they consequently have some East Country Trade  viz  to  Dantzick Koningsberg Riga  c They send Ships also to  Sweden  and import Iron Copper Tar Pitch Deals  c  from the several trading Ports of that Kingdom  The Country behind them called the  Carse  or the  Carse of Gowry  with the Vale mentioned above of  Strathmore  abounds in Corn which the Port of  Dundee  ships off in large Quantities when a Crop allows it to the great Advantage of the Gentlemen as well as Farmers for as the Gentlemen receive all their Rents in Kind they would find a great Difficulty sometimes to dispose of it if the Merchants here did not ship it off either for  London  or  Amsterdam    The Town of  Dundee  stands at a little Distance from the  Tay  but they are joined by a Causeway or Walk well paved with flat Freestone such as the Sideways in  Cheapside  and  Cornhill  and Rows of Trees are planted on either Side of the Walk which makes it very agreeable On one Part of this Walk are very good Warehouses for Merchandizes especially for heavy Goods and also Granaries for Corn  of which sometimes they have a vast Quantity laid up here and these being near the Harbour are convenient as well for the housing of Goods when landed as for the easy shipping off what lies for Exportation  The Harbour of  Dundee  was formerly very good and safe but of late Years became so ruinous and choaked up with Sand that it would not contain as antiently Ships of Burden except at the highest Tides and its Piers were so out of Repair that Ships could not lie in it with Safety At the same time the Tolbooth and publick Gaol were so much decay'd that they were obliged to be pulled down and the Town being greatly in Debt besides could not rebuild the same Wherefore to answer all these good Purposes and to pave the Streets discharge their Debts and provide Salaries for Schoolmasters to instruct their Children an Act passed  Anno  for continuing the Duties imposed by a former Act then near expired of Twopenies  Scots  upon every Pint of Ale and Beer sold within the Town and its Privileges for Years longer And the Inhabitants now reap the Benefit of it and will still more when the proposed Works are absolutely perfected  This Town was storm'd and plunder'd of great Riches by  Cromwell  and the  English  Army  The great Church was formerly collegiate and a very large Building but part of it was demolished in the Civil War the Remainder is divided into three Churches for the present Use of the Citizens  They have also a Meetinghouse or two for the Episcopal Worship for you are to take it once for all that North of  Tay  there are far more of the Episcopal Persuasion than are to be found in the South and the farther North the more so  The Tower upon the great Church here is a handsome square Building large and antient and  very high and is a good Ornament to the City It resembles the great Tower upon the Cathedral of  Canterbury  but not quite so high There is a fine and wellendowed Hospital for decay'd Townsmen of  Dundee  where they are well taken care of and provided for The  Pretender  was in this City soon after his Landing and staid here some time before he advanced to  Scoon    It was the Birthplace of  Hector Boetius  the  Scots  Historian a Man famous in his Time and whose Work was antiently more in Esteem than of late It gave the Title of Viscount to  Graham  of  Clavers  who commanded the Forces that appeared for the late King  James  at the Revolution and was killed at the Battle of  Gillicranky  which I have mentioned  Near to  Dundee  in the Mouth of the River lies  Brochtycraig  formerly wellfortify'd and noted now for a noble Salmonfishery in its Neighbourhood  It is  Scots  Miles from  Dundee  to  Montrose  the Way pleasant the Country fruitful and filled with Gentlemens Houses Among these is the noble Palace of  Panmure  forfeited in the late Rebellion by the unfortunate Earl of that Name who was wounded in the Fight near  Dumblain  The Surname of the Family is  Maul  and  Maulsburgh  a small Town near  Montrose  is called from it  The Town and Port of  Montrose  was our next Stage standing upon the Eastmost Shore of  Angus  open to the  German  or the  Caledonian  Ocean and at the Mouth of the little River of  Southesk  which makes the Harbour  This Town is well situated for Trade and has a good Harbour and the Inhabitants always carried on an advantageous Trade with  Norway  But as it was still capable of great Improvements were a Dock to be made for the Conveniency of Shipping and if good fresh Water could be procured for it of which  it stood in very great Want and the two Hills that defend the Town against Inundations having also suffered by Tempests the Corporation procured an Act  Anno  for laying a Duty of Twopenies  Scots  upon every Pint of Ale  c  sold within the Town and its Privileges for effecting these good Purposes  The Town is adorned with fine Buildings and has an Hospital for the poorer Inhabitants It gives Title of Duke as it did formerly of Earl and Marquis to the Chief of the antient and noble Family of  Graham    The  French  Fleet first made Land at this Port when they had the  Pretender  on board in the Reign of Queen  Anne  having overshot the Mouth of the  Firth  so far whither they at first designed but this Mistake which some thought a Misfortune was certainly a Deliverance to them for as on one hand it gave time to the  English  Fleet to come up with them before they could enter the  Firth  so it left them time and room also to make their Escape which if they had gone up the  Firth  they could never have done but must inevitably have been burnt and destroyed or taken by the  British  Fleet under Sir  George Byng  which was superior to them in Force  The Royal Burgh of  Aberbrothock  on this Coast besides being famous for the stately Ruins of the greatest Abbey in  Scotland  deserves to be mentioned for its convenient Situation for Trade which induced some Years since the Inhabitants to lay the Foundation of a new Harbour the old one being so decayed that it was hazardous even for small Vessels to sail into it But the Work exceeding their Abilities they procured Contributions towards so good a Design but still all proving short of what was requisite to complete the Work and the Town having run itself into Debt by what it had done and at the same time the publick Streets and  Causeways as well as the Townhouse and Gaol being in a very ruinous Condition they procured an Act to pass in the th of King  George  II for laying a Duty of Twopenies  Scots  upon every  Scots  Pint of Ale or Beer sold within the Town and Liberties which was to commence in  May  and to continue for Years for bringing to Effect these good Purposes And we may say that of late so many of these Acts have passed that  Scotland  will in a few Years if harassed by no intestine Broils and continuing in Peace make a better Figure than it has done for Centuries past  The Abbey was formerly endowed with great Revenues by King  William  I who was buried here under a stately Monument  In the inner Parts of the Shire to the Westward is  Forfar  the County Town and  Brechin  formerly a Bishop's See made so by K  David  and where some Part of a small Cathedral is still standing It is seated upon the River  Southesk  over which it has a stately Bridge of two Arches and is considerable for its Salmon and Cattlemarkets It is also memorable for a great Victory obtained here over the  Danes  by the Chief of the Family of  Keith  Earl Mareschal who having killed their General was advanced to great Honours by  Malcolm  II There was a high Stone erected over the Grave of the  Danish  General which is still called  Camus's Cross  from his Name and at Miles Distance is another Cross over the Grave of another eminent  Danish  Warrior and both of them have antique Letters and Pictures upon them  From  Montrose  the Shore lies due North to  Aberdeen  In the Way is the Castle of  Dunnoter  once a strong Fortification upon an high Precipice of a Rock The Castle was surrounded with invincible Walls said the honest  Scot  who shewed us the Road to it having Towers at proper Distances  after the old Way of fortifying Towns The Earl Mareschal of the Name of  Keith  was Lord of this Castle as also of a good House near it and a great Estate But what he had is now gone for being in the Rebellion his Estate was forfeited and his Lordship making his Escape went into the Service of  Spain  in which he still continues But we ought to observe that his Brother going into the Service of  Russia  made such a Figure there that he is a LieutenantGeneral in that Empire and greatly esteemed for his personal Bravery and Conduct This Gentleman making lately a Visit to  England  was received with great Marks of Distinction and Favour by the Court and Nobility and may be truly said to be one of the best Generals that the late Czarina who yet had many excellent Commanders had Reason to boast of  Dunnoter  Castle is now demolished It is situated in the Shire of  Kincardin  called the  Merns  The County is noted for its Timber having in it upwards of Five Millions of Firtrees besides vast Numbers of other Kinds planted within these Years by the Gentry at and about their Seats and which they are yearly adding to and improving  Kincardin  was formerly the Countytown but that Advantage now by Statute belongs to  Stonehyne    Innerbervy  on the Coast was made a Royal Burgh by King  Alexander  III  Paldykirk  so called from  Palladius  first Bishop of the  Scots  is noted for its annual three Days Fair The principal Commodity brought to it is coarse Cloth which is commonly transported to the  Netherlands    On the Lands of  Arbuthie  and  Redeloak  are some Trenches to be seen cast up by the  Danes  at one of their Invasions And round the Hill of  Urie  is a deep Ditch where the  Scots  encamped  Fordun  lies also in this County famous in antient Times for the Reliques of the aforesaid St  Palladius    It is also noted for being the Surname of  John Fordun  the  Scots  Historian Author of the Book called  The Scots Chronicon  to which all succeeding Historians of this Nation have been much obliged  The Earl Mareschal was hereditary Sheriff of this Country  We proceeded then to  Aberdeen  a Place so eminent that it commands some Stay upon it It stands at the Mouth of two Rivers and is divided into two Towns or Cities one called the  New  the other the  Old Aberdeen  about a Mile distant from each other one situate on the River  Don  the other on the River  Dee  from whence they are more properly called  Aberdon  and  Aberdeen    Aberdon  or the  Old Town  lies a Mile Northward from  Aberdeen  or the  New Town  and is sometimes called  Bonaccord  from its Motto It is situated in the Mouth of the River  Don  which is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perch taken in it  The  Old Town  must without doubt be very antient for they tell us the  New Aberdeen  is supposed to be upwards of Years old tho' none of their Registers mention the particular Time of its being built or by whom The Cities are not equally situated for Trade one of the Rivers being broader than the other and it is the common Opinion that Part of the old City called  the Monastery  was washed down by the Sea so that it obliged the Citizens to build farther off That accordingly they built the  New Aberdeen  upon the Bank of the other River upon a Piece of hilly Ground But this is all Conjecture and has Probability only for its Support  Old Aberdeen  was formerly the Bishop's Seat and has a Cathedral commonly called  St Machar  's a large and stately Structure which was antiently much more magnificent it suffered greatly at the Time of the Reformation and more since the Revolution  The chief Ornament of this Town is the  King's College  on the South Side of it a neat and stately Structure  The Church and Steeple are built of hewn Stone and the Summit of the latter resembles an Imperial Crown The Windows of the Church were formerly esteemed for their Paintings and something of their Splendor still remains In the Steeple are two Bells of extraordinary Bigness besides others  Close to the Church is a Library well furnished with Books  This College was founded by Bishop  Elphinston  in the Year and the greatest Part built by him but King  James  IV taking the Patronage upon him it was called  The King's College  The Bull for it was procured from Pope  Alexander  VI in endowing it with as ample Privileges as those of  Paris  and  Bononia    There are in this College a Principal a Subprincipal who is also one of the Regents three other Regents or Professors of Philosophy a Professor of Humanity or Philology a Professor of Divinity a Doctor of Physick a Professor of the Oriental Tongues a Professor of the Civil Law and a Professor of the Mathematicks Dr  Frazer  has lately been a great Benefactor to it  New Aberdeen  is about a Mile distant as we have said from the  Old  situated at the Mouth of the River  Dee  It is the County Town and by Consequence the Seat of the Sheriffs Courts It exceeds all the Cities in the North of  Scotland  for Largeness Extent and Beauty It stands in a wholsome Air has a great Revenue from its Salmonfishery and the Inhabitants are generally very courteous It stands upon three Hills the main Part upon the highest and the Skirts of it extend into the Plain The Houses are neatly built are generally four Stories high or more and have for the most part  Gardens and Orchards belonging to them which makes the City pleasant and healthful and the Prospect of it beautiful at a Distance  From a round Hill at the West End of the City flow two Springs one of clear Water and another with Water which in Taste and Quality comes very near the  Spaw  in  Germany  Dr  William Barclay  wrote a Treatise concerning it  In the Highstreet is a Church built of Freestone and good Architecture  In this City stands the  Marshal College  founded by  George  Earl Marshal in the Year to which the City has added many Buildings at their own Charge  In this College which is a distinct University of itself are a Principal four Professors of Philosophy a Professor of Divinity and a Professor of Mathematicks and there is lately added a Professor of Physick It has a very good Library which was founded by the City inlarged by the Gifts of several learned Men and furnished with Mathematical Instruments  In this City is also a Grammar School founded by Dr  Dune  having one Master and three Ushers There is also a Musick School  The Church called  St Nicolas  's is a handsome Edifice of Freestone with a lofty Steeple resembling a Pyramid it was formerly divided into three Churches The Body of this Church is adorned with a Tower and a Steeple with Pinacles  Here is also a Prison and a Workhouse belonging to the Town likewise an Almshouse and three Hospitals and near the Harbour stands the Customhouse The Marketplace is very beautiful and spacious and the Streets adjoining are very handsome and most of the Houses are built of Stone four Stories high with handsome Sashwindows and are very well furnished within the Citizens here  being as gay as genteel and perhaps as rich as in any City in  Scotland    The Bridge at  Old Aberdeen  over the  Don  consists of one immense Arch of Stone sprung from two Rocks one on each Side which serve as a Buttment to the Arch so that it may be said to have a Foundation coeval with Nature and which will last as long The other Bridge is upon the River  Dee  West above  New Aberdeen  and has seven very stately Arches  The People of  Aberdeen  and indeed of almost all this Country are generally of the Episcopal Persuasion so that were it not for the legal Establishment the Presbyterian Preachers would have but few Hearers and slender Incomes Almost every Parish has a Meetinghouse where the Liturgy is read At  Aberdeen  and  Peterhead  they have beautiful Chapels and even Organs  Near the City is a stately Stone Bridge of seven Arches over the  Dee  built by Bishop  Gawin Dumbar    The Air of this County to those who were born in a hotter seems cold but is in itself healthful and temperate The Winter is milder than can be expected from such a Climate which seems a Wonder to  Danes Poles  and  Prussians  when they come into this Country and consider that with them during the Winter there is nothing but perpetual Frost and Snow The Soil in general is not unfruitful if duly cultivated it produces Wheat Rye Barley Oats in abundance Pease and Beans nor do they want Roots and Herbs for Food and Physick and foreign Plants grow very well there as daily Experience testifies The mountainous Part of the County affords very good Pasturage and the other as good Corn  The adjoining Sea not only furnishes them with plenty of Fish but reproaches them with their Negligence when they see the  Dutch  Fleets continually  fishing on the Coasts from whence they reap great Gain but 'tis the Humour of the Inhabitants to apply themselves to the Salmonfishing and to neglect that of all other Sorts  The Quantity of Salmon and Perches taken in both Rivers is a kind of Prodigy The Proprietors are united into a Company there being so many Shares of which no Person can enjoy above one at a time The Profits are very considerable the Salmon being sent abroad into different Parts of the World particularly into  England France  the  Baltick  and several other Places  The Herringfishing is a common Blessing to all this Shore of  Scotland  and is like the  Indies  at their Door were it properly used by the  Scots  in general But I must observe that by this however the Merchants of  Aberdeen  are able to carry on a Trade to  Dantzick  and  Koningsberg Riga  and  Narva Wybourgh  and  Stockholm    They have also a very good Manufacture of Linen and likewise of Worsted Stockens which they send to  England  in great Quantities and of which they make some so fine that I have seen them sold for and Shillings a Pair They also send them over to  Holland  and into the North and East Seas in large Quantities  They have also a particular Export here of Pork pickled and packed up in Barrels which they sell chiefly to the  Dutch  for the victualling their  EastIndia  Ships and their Men of War the  Aberdeen  Pork having the Reputation of being the best cured for keeping on very long Voyages of any in  Europe    They export also Corn and Meal but they generally bring it from the  Firth  of  Murray  or  Cromarty  the Corn coming from about  Inverness  where they have great Quantities  In a word the People of  Aberdeen  are universal Merchants so far as the Trade of the Northern Part  of the World will extend and it may be esteemed the third City in  Scotland  that is the next after  Edinburgh  and  Glasgow    This Shire contains in it  Mar  with its Appurtenances  Birse Glentaner Glenmuick Strathdee Strathdon Braes  of  Mar  and  Cromar  most part of  Buchan Formartin Garioch  and  Strathbogy    The latter is a large and antient Barony watered by the Rivers  Dovern  and  Bogy  it was erected into an Earldom by King  James  VI in favour of the Chief of the noble and antient Family of  Gordon  whom he afterwards created Marquis of  Huntley Strathbogy  is very fruitful in Corn and Pasturage and is remarkable for the fine Linenyarn spun by the Women there and sold to the Merchant  It is mostly inhabited by  Gordons  Vassals to the Duke of  Gordon  who has a magnificent Castle here called  Strathbogy  from the Name of the County There are of this Name besides the Duke the Earls of  Sutherland Aboyn Aberdeen  and late Viscount of  Kenmure  likewise a great many Gentlemen of Note in other Parts of the Kingdom  The County of  Mar  gave Title of Earl to the Chief of the Family of  Erskine  The Sheriffdom is the King's Gift  In  Aberdeenshire  are Quarries of spotted Marble and Slate and Pearls are found in their Rivers of a large Size and fine Colour  There was formerly a Mint at  Aberdeen  as appears by several Pieces of Coin with the  Aberdeae  upon them kept in the Closets of the Curious  Other Towns in this County are    Kintore  a Royal Burgh on the  Don  which gives the Title of Earl to a Branch of the Family of  Keith      Inverary  made a Royal Burgh by King  Robert Bruce      Peterhead  with a good Harbour  We ought not to omit that on the th of  October  an accidental Fire broke out in  Aberdeen  whereby the CommissaryClerk's Office was suddenly consumed and at the same time the Registers and Records of all Testaments and Confirmations all Acts of Curacy Judicial Deeds and other Writs and Evidences  c  were intirely burnt and destroyed which unhappy Accident being likely to be attended with pernicious Effects to Persons Rights and Properties an Act passed  George  I for supplying the Records so burnt or lost and another in the th of the same Reign for making the former more effectual  The Town of  Aberdeen  had suffered much by the publick Commotions in  Scotland  after the Revolution took place so that an Act for laying the Duty of Twopenies  Scots  on every  Scots  Pint of Ale and Beer sold within the Town  c  had been imposed by the  Scotish  Parliament in and continued by the same in for enabling them to discharge the Debts incurred on that Occasion And the last Act being near expired and Debts still remaining unpaid an Act passed for continuing the said Duties for the following good Purposes  viz  for paying off the remaining Debts of the Town for building a new Pier on the Northside of the Harbour for repairing the old Pier on the Southside which was very much sunk and decay'd for repairing the great Church called the  Old Church  which was in a very decayed Condition for rebuilding the Townhouse which was also in a very bad State and for maintaining and carrying on other publick Works for the Benefit of the Town This Act is to remain in Force for Years and it may be easily judged that the Town of  Aberdeen  will be much improved when the proposed Works are all absolutely completed  From  Aberdeen  the Coast goes on to a Point of Land which is the farthest Northeast Part of  Britain  and is called by the Sailors  Buchanness  being in the Shire or County of  Buchan  Part of which belongs to  Aberdeenshire  It was to this Point the  French  Squadron with the  Pretender  on board in the Reign of Queen  Anne  kept their Flight in Sight of the Shore being thus far pursued by Sir  George Byng  with the  English  Fleet but from hence they steer'd away Northeast as if for the  Norway  Coast when the  English  Admiral seeing no Probability of coming up with them gave over the Chace but they altered their Course in the Night stood away South and came back to  Dunkirk  whence they set out  On the Southside of the Water of  Eugic  stands  Peterhead  with a Road which will hold Sail of Ships and at this Place it is Highwater when the Moon is directly South In many Places of this Shire are great Stones placed circularly one of the largest in the Middle towards the South which have the Air of Places of Worship in the Ages of Heathenism The dropping Cave of  Slanes  is very remarkable of the petrify'd Substance whereof is made excellent Lime  This Country however remote is full of Nobility and Gentry and their Seats are seen even unto the extremest Shores The Family of  Frazer  carries its Name to  Frazerburgh  in the very Northermost Point of the Country  Ereskines  Earls of  Marr  had their Familyseat at  Kildrummy  in the County of  Marr  a little South of this Part of the County where the late unhappy Earl first set up his Standard for the  Pretender  The  Hayes  Earls of  Errol  are in  Buchan  and the Family of  Forbes  Lord  Forbes  and  Forbes  Lord  Pitsligo  are still farther and the latter on the very Shore of the  Caledonian  Ocean The  Gordons  and  Keiths  are very numerous also in these Parts  Mr  Camden  relates that on the Coast of this Country a great Piece of Amber was driven on Shore by the Force of the Sea as big to use his own Words  As an Horse  I shall add nothing to the Story because it is hard to give Credit to it it is enough that I name my Author for I could not learn from the Inhabitants that they ever saw any more of it  I ought not to omit  Innerury  belonging to  Garioch  in  Aberdeenshire  being the  Scotsman  's Boast for here  Robert Bruce  tho' sick and carried in a Horselitter defeated  John Cummins  and those who adhered to him in Favour of  Edward  I of  England  who held  Scotland  in Subjection This was the first Victory King  Robert  obtained and laid the Foundation of the Overthrow of the  English  Usurpation in  Scotland  Near the same Place also in  Alexander Steuart  Earl of  Mar  defeated  Donald  of the Isles in the bloody Battle of the  Harlow    From hence the East Shore of  Scotland  being at an End the Land tends away due West and the Shire of  Bamff  beginning you see the Towns of  Bamff Elgin Frazersburg  and the famous Monastery of  Kinloss  where the murdered Body of King  Duff  was after many Years dug up and discovered to be his by various Tokens  The Shire of  Bamff  deserves some Notice for the following Particulars for that in it is situated  Strathyla  which drives a great Trade in Lime and fat Cattle and it abounds so with Limestone that they build their Houses with it They carry on a Trade in fine Linen also by means of their weekly Markets at  Keith  a neighbouring Village Upon the Banks of the  Spey  which runs thro' this County lies the  Bog of Gicht  now called  Gordon Castle  the noblest Palace in the North being the Duke of  Gordon  's chief Seat adorned with pleasant Gardens and a great Park The Castle appears so large that  it looks more like a Town than a Nobleman's Seat The Duke is Proprietor of this Part of the County  Strathave  is the paternal Inheritance of his Family And his Grace has a fine Estate and other Seats hereabouts The late Duke had a little embroiled himself with the Affairs of and his Son then Marquis of  Huntley  still more but got off without a Forfeiture by his Prudence and good Fortune  The Town of  Cullen  an antient Royal Burgh stands in the Shire of  Bamff  It is chiefly noted for its fruitful Soil and Salmonfishing for having no Port it has little Trade except for its Corn and Salmon  The Shire itself takes Name from  Bamff  a Burgh Royal seated at the Mouth of  Doverne  in the  Boyne  where the Sheriff holds his Courts In it are the Ruins of an old Castle near which is the Abbey of  Deer  formerly belonging to the  Cistercian  Monks and founded by  William Cumin  Earl of  Buchan  In  Belvenie  is found the Stone of which Alum is made and in the County of  Boyne  great Quarries of spotted Marble have been discovered  Buchan  is Part in  Aberdeenshire  Part in the Shire of  Bamff  one of its principal Towns is  Frazersburgh  and  Peterhead  is another The latter is a good Markettown with a Port and small Harbour with two little Piers for Fishing but being so near  Aberdeen  has not those Helps and Advantages that might be otherwise probably given to it so that at low Water it is all dry and the smallest Ships lie aground in it  The Earl of  Saltoun  has very lately built at  Frazersburgh  a most excellent new Pier and Bulwark all of Freestone which renders that Harbour as safe and commodious as any on the East Coast so that Ships may winter there at once with great Safety The Water at full Sea is or Feet  From the Point of Land called  Buchanness  the Ships begin their Accounts for their several Voyages what they call their Departure As in  England  they do from  Wintertonness  on the Northeast Part of  Norfolk  and from the  Downs  for the Voyages to the Southward  From  Fifeness  which is the Northermost Point on the Mouth of  Edinburgh Firth  being the Southermost Land of  Fife  to this Point of  Buchanness  the Land lies almost due North and South and the Shore is the Eastermost Land of  Scotland  The Distance between them is Leagues Mile which is just Miles tho' the Mariners say that measuring by the Sea it is but and from  Wintertonness  near  Yarmouth  to this Point call'd  Buchanness  is just Miles  The River or  Firth  of  Tay  opens into the Sea about four Leagues North from  Fifeness  and as there is a Lighthouse on the  Isle of May  as I have said before in the Mouth of the  Firth  of  Forth  at  Edinburgh  a little South of this Point call'd  Fifeness  there are likewise two Lighthouses at the Entrance of the  Firth  of  Tay  for the Directions of the Sailors when they are bound into that River and particularly for their avoiding the two Sands which lie off from the Southside of the Entrance  Buchanness  is generally also the first Land of  Great Britain  which the Ships make in their Voyages Home from  Archangel  in  Russia  or from their Whalefishing Voyages to  Greenland  and  Spitsbergen  in the North Seas And near this Point at  Pitsligo  a great Ship was cast away in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time bound Home from  Archangel  having on board the first Embassador sent by the Great Duke of  Muscovy  to any of the Christian Princes of  Europe  he being commissioned to treat with Queen  Elizabeth  for a League of Peace and Commerce He likewise lost a most valuable Present designed for the Queen of  rich and costly Furrs in those Days reputed inestimable The Embassador was happily saved and brought on Shore by the People of  Pitsligo  but the Ship and all the Goods were lost  From this Point of Easterly Land all that great Bay or Inlet of the Sea reaching quite to the North of  Scotland  is called  Murray Firth  and the Northermost Point is  Dungsbyhead  which is the Northeast Point of  Caithness  and opens to  Pentland Firth  By  Pentland Firth  you are to understand the Passage of the Sea beyond  Caithness  between  Scotland  and the Isles of  Orkney  What is call'd  Murray Firth  is not like many others the Mouth of a River as that of  Edinburgh  or  Tay  but is an open Bay in the Sea as the Bay of  Biscay  or the Gulph of  Mexico  are and reaches as I have said from  Petershead  to  Dungsbyhead  opposite to the  Orkneys  the Distance of Miles but it is almost twice as far by Land because of the Depth of that Bay which obliges us to travel from  Pitsligo  West near Miles till we come to  Inverness    This County of  Buchan  is more to be taken Notice of from what is to be seen on the Sea Shore than in the Land for the Country is mountainous and in some Places not very fertile but as we coasted along West we came into a much better Country particularly the Shires of  Bamff  which I have already mention'd  Elgin  and the County of  Murray  from whence the Bay I just now described is called  Murray Firth    Murray  is a pleasant Country the Soil fruitful water'd with fine Rivers and full of good Towns and Gentlemens Seats more than could be expected in so remote a Part of the Kingdom  This Country is a Plain for between and Miles together and the Soil is by that means render'd more fruitful and rich and the Temperature of the Air more soften'd than in other Parts of  Scotland  insomuch that the Harvest here and in the Vale of  Strathbogy  and all the Country to  Inverness  is observed to be more early than in  Northumberland  nay than in  Derbyshire  and even some Parts of the more Southerly Counties in  England  as particularly in the East of  Kent  and  Sussex  As a Confirmation of this I affirm that I have seen the new Wheat of this Country and  Inverness  brought to Market to  Edinburgh  before the Wheat at  Edinburgh  has been fit to reap and yet the Harvest about  Edinburgh  is thought to be as forward as in most Parts even of  England  itself In a Word it is usual in  Murray  and the Country about it to begin with their Harvest in the Month of  July  and it is not very unusual to have new Corn fully ripe and thresh'd out shipped off and brought to  Edinburgh  to Sale within the Month of  August    The River  Lossie  in this County is famous for Salmon there being annually pickled and exported from to Lasts all taken in a few Months of the Summer and in a Space of one Mile at a Village called  Germach  It abounds with Fish to the very Head but still the greatest Quantity is used for home Consumption and taken either with hooked Tridents by Day or Wicker Baskets or little Boats covered with Hides by Night None but the Natives who are used to them will venture into those Boats The common Drink in these Parts is Ale and sometimes Beer and they have good  French  Wine very cheap as I and my Company experienced but the Inhabitants prefer  Aqua Vitae  of their own extracting from Aledregs and Spices to much richer Wines than the  French  of this they drink plentifully themselves and are very liberal of it to their Friends And a Bottle of this Liquor and some Cheese will make a  Murray  Man undertake the greatest WinterJourneys without wishing for any other Provision  This County is divided into two Shires the greater called the Shire of  Elgin  the other the Shire of  Nairn  The Town of  Nairn  lies on the Mouth of the River of that Name along which lie the Seats of many Persons of Quality  Near the Castle of  Caddel  or  Calder  on that River is a Vein of Freestone and many Signs of Copper  Tarnaway  Castle on the River  Findorn  in this County is an old Castle and Seat belonging to the Earls of  Murray    A little lower on the other Side stands the Burgh of  Forress  in an exceeding pleasant Situation The Kings of  Scotland  formerly resided here in a Castle that is now gone to Ruin and lower formerly stood the noble Abbey of  Kinloss    On the Road to  Forress  is a large Pillar of one Stone being a Monument of a Victory obtained by King  Malcolm Mac Kenneth  over  Sueno  King of  Denmark  the Inscription is now worn out Betwixt this Place and  Elgin  are numberless Seats of the Quality  In this rich County on the River  Lossie  which rises a few Miles above it and empties itself into the Sea a few Miles below it lies  Elgin  formerly a Bishop's See It is situated in a very fruitful Soil tho' somewhat sandy The Ruins of the Castle are still to be seen on the East End of the Town tho' demolish'd so long ago as the Wars of the  Danes  There was a noble Cathedral here which for Largeness Splendor Magnificence and Workmanship had hardly its Equal in the Kingdom The usual Place of Residence of the Bishop was at the Castle of  Spynie  within a Mile of the Town a very noble Seat with fine Gardens and Woods  But tho' the Town of  Elgin  has Reason to be proud of its Situation it was not very rich in its Town Revenues for it had long laboured under  heavy and burdensome Debts which being increased by the Rebellion in put a Stop to divers of its new publick Works and made several others run into Decay At the same time the River  Lossie  having very insufficient Banks the Chanel of it became choaked with Sand which made it subject to overflow and moreover the Harbour of  Lossie  itself which may be called the Port of  Elgin  lying not far from it became ruinous and decayed to the great Prejudice of Persons trading in the  Murray  Firth as well as to the Town For all these Reasons and in order to inlarge and improve as well as repair the said Harbour of  Lossie  an Act passed in the Year laying a Duty of Twopenies  Scots  on every  Scots  Pint of Ale or Beer that should be vended within the said Town and its Liberties so that it bids fair to make as flourishing a Figure as it has done for Centuries past  Above  Elgin Forress  and  Nairn  lies that Part of the Country called  The Bra  of Murray  no way comparable to the lower Part for Fruitfulness and beyond this are Mountains Woods and green Valleys particularly  Strathherin  well inhabited and abounding with little Towns and Villages and  Strathnairn  a still better Soil and possessed by several Gentlemen  Strathherin  also abounds with Lakes Mountains and Streams  In this County lies  Lochmoy  with an Island where the Laird of  Mackintosh  a Name well known in  England  as well as  Scotland  by means of the famous Brigadier of that Name who was taken Prisoner at the Battle of  Preston  escaped out of  Newgate  and lately died in Peace in  Scotland  has his Seat This Tribe is called  Clan Chattau  and are numerous in this County  But to say a few Words more of  Elgin  before we leave this County Gentlemen of all Parties and Opinions as if this Town was the Court for this Part of the Island leave their Highland Habitations in the Winter and come to live at  Elgin  with very  engaging Freedom so that it is a Place of greater Resort than could be imagined at the Distance of measured Miles from  London  and more if we must go by  Edinburgh    This rich Country continues with very little Intermission till we come to  Strathnairn  or the Valley of  Nairn  where it extends a little farther in Breadth towards the Mountains and is not inferior to the other in Fruitfulness From the western Part of this County you may observe that the Land goes away again to the North and as if you were to enter into another Island beyond  Britain  you find a large Lake or Inlet from the Sea of  Murray  going on West as if it were to cut through the Island for we could see no End of it nor could some of the Countrypeople tell us how far it reached but that it went beyond  Lochaber  So that we thought till our Maps and further Inquisition informed us it had joined the Western Ocean  After we had travelled about twelve Miles and descended from a rising Ground upon which we then were we perceived the Lake contracted in one particular Place to the ordinary Size of a River as if designed by Nature to give Passage to the Inhabitants to converse with the Northern Part and then it opened again to its former Breadth and continued in the Form of a large Lake as before for many more Miles than we could see being in the Whole according to Mr  Camden  Miles long but if it be taken on both Sides the Pass 'tis above Miles in Length  This Situation must necessarily make the narrow Part a most important Pass from the more Southerly Parts of  Scotland  to the Northern Countries which are beyond it We have been told the  Romans  never conquered thus far and the Conquests of  Oliver Cromwell  have been much magnified on this Account but if what Mr  Camden  records and is confirmed by other Accounts from the Men of  Learning and Observation be true this must be a Mistake for we are told that near  Bean  Castle in the County of  Nairn  there was found in the Year a fine Marble Vessel curiously carved which was full of  Roman  Coins of several Sorts also several old Forts or Mounts have been seen here which by their Remains evidently shewed themselves to be  Roman    I now entered the Shire of  Inverness  abounding with large Woods of Firr and Oak and having in it some Iron Mines It contains  Badenock Lochaber  and the South and West Parts of  Rosse  and the Isle of  Sky  of all which I shall speak as they offer in the Course I took  In the narrow Pass mentioned above over the Lake stands the Town and Fortress of  Inverness  that is a Town on the inner Bank of the River  Ness  The Situation of it as I have said before intimates that it is a Place of Strength and accordingly it has a Castle founded in antient Times to command the Pass And some Authors write that it was antiently a Royal House for the Kings of  Scotland  Be that as it will  Oliver Cromwell  thought it a Place of such Importance that he built a strong Citadel here and kept a stated Garison always in it and sometimes more than a Garison finding it needful to have a large Body of his old veteran Troops posted here to preserve the Peace of the Country and keep the  Highlanders  in Awe which they did effectually all his Time  It is observed that at the End of those troublesome Days when the Troops on all Sides came to be disbanded and the Men dispersed abundance of  English  Soldiers settled in this fruitful Part of the Country from whence it received two Advantages  They learnt the Art of Husbandry in full Perfection which they did not understand before which with the Help of a rich Soil has rendered this Part  of the Country more fruitful than the rest of  Scotland  to this Day And to this it is in some measure owing that the Harvest is so early and the Corn so good as is observed above  As  Cromwell  's Soldiers initiated them thus into the Arts and Industry of the Husbandman so they left them the  English  Accent upon their Tongues which they likewise preserve to this Day for they speak perfect  English  even much better than in the most Southerly Provinces of  Scotland  nay some will say as well as at  London  itself  Their Tongue is not only  Anglicised  but their Palates too their Way of Eating and Cookery Dress and Behaviour is according to the Southern Mode I wish they do not in time degenerate into Luxury and forget that military Original which first reformed them  The Fort which was then built and afterwards demolished has been restored since the Revolution and a Garison was always kept here by King  William  for the better regulating the  Highlands  which Post was of singular Importance in the Time of the Insurrection of the Earl of  Marr  for the  Pretender  when tho' his Party took it they were driven out again by the Country with the Assistance of the Earl of  Sutherland  and several other of the Nobility and Gentry who stood fast to the King's Interest  Inverness  may be said to be a pleasant clean and wellbuilt Town There are some Merchants in it and it has a good Share of Trade In it the Sheriff keeps his Court It consists of two large handsome Streets and has a stately Stone Bridge of seven large Arches over the River  Ness  where as I said before it grows narrow between the Sea and the Lake The Water of this River is almost always warm and all the Year long is never so cold as to freeze nay in the sharpest Winter if Cakes of Ice are thrown into it they will be quickly thaw'd by its  Warmth Small Vessels may come up to the Town but larger Ships which often come thither for Corn are forced to lie at some Distance East from it  But it has been lately improved and is still farther improving for in the Year an Act passed for laying a Duty of a Sixth of a Peny Sterling on every Pint of Ale  c  sold within the Town and its Privileges for building a Church and making a Harbour there The Preamble to the Act giving a Description of the Place and the Reasons of applying for it I shall insert and is to the following Effect  That the Town of  Inverness  is situate near the Sea and very capable of Improvements in its Trade and Commerce and having but a very small publick Revenue incumbered with Debts and those increased by the Expence the Inhabitants were at in opposing the Rebellion of And the Church of the said Town beside being ruinous was not large enough to contain the Inhabitants for the effecting of these good Purposes the said Act was passed  This Act was to be in Force for Years only and the first five Years it produced so well that the Magistrates of  Inverness  entered upon a Design greatly to inlarge and improve their Harbour in order to which they purchased Grounds rented Quarries built Boats for transporting Stone deepened their Harbour erected Bulwarks and Quays so that it was made much more commodious than ever But the next Years the Produce of the Duties was so low occasioned by the excessive Use of run Tea and Brandy which People could buy so cheap that the Consumption of Beer and Ale was greatly lessened and they having run much behindhand were forced to apply for a further Continuation of the Act and accordingly in the th Year of King  George  II an Act passed for continuing the same for  Years more for paying the Debts contracted and effecting the other good Purposes I have mentioned Which when done will make  Inverness  a Place of as great Account as any in the North of  Scotland    When we are over the Bridge of  Inverness  you enter that which we truly call the North of  Scotland  and others the North  Highlands  in which are several distinct Shires but cannot call for a particular Description because they are all one undistinguished Range of Mountains and Woods overspread with vast and almost uninhabited Rocks and Steeps filled with Deer innumerable of various Kinds among which are some of those the Antients called  Harts  and  Roebucks  with overgrown Stags and Hinds of the Reddeer Kind  Before I describe this frightful Country it is necessary to observe that  Scotland  may be divided into four Districts which I have not seen any of our Geographers do before me yet I believe may not be an improper Measurement for such as would form a due Idea of the Whole in their Minds  The  Southland  or that Part of  Scotland  South of the River  Tay  drawing a Line from the  Tay  about  Perth  to  Lochlomond  and down to  Dumbarton  and the Bank of  Clyde    The  Middle  or  Midland  being all the Country from the  Tay  and the  Loughlomond  North to the Lake of  Ness  and  Aber  including a long Slope to the South taking in the Western  Highlands  of  Argyll  and  Lorn  and the Isles of  Isla  and  Jura    The  Northland  being all the Country beyond  Inverness  and the  Lough  or River  Ness  North drawing the Line over the narrow Space of  Glengary  between the  Ness  and  Aber  and bounded by them both from the Eastern to the Western Sea  The  Islands  being all the Western and Northern Islands the  Hebrides Skye Orkneys  and other Isles of  Shetland    According to this Description having passed the Bridge over the River  Ness  I am now entered on the third Division of  Scotland  called the  Northland  Here are not only the best Hawks of all Kinds but Eagles in great Numbers which prey upon the young Fawns when they fall first and upon Wild Fowl with which this Part of the Country abounds  The Rivers and Lakes also in this Country are so prodigiously full of Salmon that it is hardly credible what Quantities are taken in the  Spey  the  Nairn  the  Ness  and other Rivers hereabout  The several Countries beyond the  Ness  are  Ross Sutherland Strathnavern Caithness  and beyond those the Islands of  Orkney  and  Shetland    Sutherland  is called the Shire of  Dornoch  from the chief Town of the Province called  Dornoch  a Royal Burgh noted for a Castle belonging to the Earl of  Sutherland  for its Cathedral Church for the Diocese of  Caithness  which once was Part of this Shire and for its four annual Fairs It has three remarkable Forests besides abundance of other Woods which afford pleasant Hunting and Fowling One sort of Bird is peculiar to this Country called  Knug  which resembles a Parrot and digs its Nest in the Trunks of Oak with its Beak There are about Lakes in this County The greatest is  Lochskin  Miles in Length in many of them are Islands very pleasant for Summer Habitations In the Isle of  Brora  the Earl of  Sutherland  has a House which he makes use of when he comes to hunt Deer which abound in it and in some of the Lakes and Rivers of this County as well as in the Rivers of  Aberdeen  and  Rosse  are found Pearls of great Value In short this Shire so abounds with Lakes Rivers and Bays that there is scarce a Farm in the whole County  but is washed either with fresh or salt Water so that the Inhabitants have Store of Fish and Fowl The Beer or Big in this County is reckoned excellent It has also Silver Mines and excellent Iron Mines Coal Mines and Quarries of Freestone but much neglected It has many commodious Harbours for Ships to export its Commodities which are Cod Salmon salt Beef Wool Skins Hides Tallow Butter Cheese  c  The Bays and Coasts also abound with Seals have sometimes Whales and Shell Fish of all sorts  The Earl of  Sutherland  has a Castle beyond  Inverness  called  Dunrobin  situate on the Eastern Shore of which his Lordship was sent down by Sea to take an early Possession in the late Rebellion and which if he had not done would soon have fallen into the Hands of the late Earl of  Marr  's Party but his coming timely thither prevented him and the Country on that Side from joining the Troops of the  Pretender  In the Gardens of this Seat tho' so Northerly Saffron grows very well and comes to Maturity  Strathnavern  is Part of  Sutherland  and derives its Name from  Strath  a Valley situated on the River  Navern  which runs thro' it The Country is mountainous and formerly was noted for breeding greater Numbers of ravenous Wolves than any other in  Scotland  The Bays and Rivers are full of Fish it is very woody and many Lakes are in the Valleys There are several Monuments in it of Victories gained over the  Danes  particularly one at  Enbo  which is a Stone Cross said to be over a  Danish  King The Inhabitants are great Hunters and despise those who are not so that Venison with them is a common Dish The Situation of the Country not admitting of Towns the Inhabitants live up and down in small Villages On the Northern Coast of this County are several Islands  Of the many Lakes  Lochnavern  and  Lochyol  are the largest and the latter affords an Island which is inhabited in the Summer time  Borwe  and  Young  are the Places of most Note the latter the principal Seat of the Lord  Rea  Chief of the  Mackays  who is the principal Proprietor of  Strathnavern  but holds it of the Earl of  Sutherland  to whose eldest Son it gives the Title of Lord The Earls of  Sutherland  were formerly of the Name of  Sutherland  to the Heiress of which a Son of the House of  Gordon  married from whom the present Earl is descended They have a long time claimed Precedency as the first Earls of the Kingdom and in order to recover it have reassumed their former Name They have great Royalties as being Admirals of that and some of the neighbouring Counties and all the Gentlemen of  Sutherland  hold of them Lord  Duffus  is descended of this Family The Earl is Hereditary Sheriff of it The County has several Mountains of white Marble as we were told  North of the Mouth of the River  Nesse  is the famous  Cromarty  Bay or  Cromarty  Firth noted for being the finest Harbour with the least Business perhaps of any in  Britain  It is Miles long and in many Places two Miles broad and like  Milfordhaven  in  Wales  is able to receive the Royal Navy of  GreatBritain  both to go out and come in with Safety but for want of Trade this noble Harbour which by Geographers and Mariners is called  Portus Salutis  or  the Harbour of Safety  is become almost useless  The Shire of  Cromarty  is denominated from a Royal Burgh standing upon the Firth of  Cromarty  The Waters of  Connel  are celebrated for the Pearls found in them Of great Part of this County the Earl of  Cromarty  is Sheriff and Proprietor The Straths or Valleys upon the Waterside abound with Woods Particularly upon the Hills is great  Store of all sorts of Game also near  Alserig  upon the Waters of  Braan  and on the  Carron  are great Woods of Fir  All the County beyond the River  Nesse  and the  Loch  flowing into it is called  Caithness  and extends to the Northermost Land in  Scotland  It is divided from  Sutherland  by the Mountain  Ord  and a Tract of Mountains running from it as far as  Knochfin    Some People tell us they have Lead Copper and Iron in this Part of  Scotland  and I am very much inclined to believe it but it seems reserved for a future and more industrious Age to search into it Should a Time come when these hidden Treasures of the Earth shall be discovered and improved this Part of  Scotland  would be no longer esteemed poor for such a Production would soon change the Face of Things bring Wealth and Commerce to it fill the Harbours with Ships the Towns with People and by consuming the Provisions occasion the Soil to be cultivated the Fish cured the Cattle consumed at Home and thereby diffuse Prosperity all around them  Our Writers have represented the Inhabitants here wild and barbarous They were so formerly perhaps but we see the  Mackenzies Macleods Sutherlands M  c  Leans M  c  Donalds Gordons M  c  Keys Macfergusons M  c  Intoshes  and others sprung from thence equally accomplished for the Court or Camp  It must be owned here are but few Towns the People live dispersed in Clans under a kind of Vassalage submitting to their Lords as their lawful Monarchs and many of them acknowledge no other tho' this too is in a manner got over and the Clans are less dependent on their Chiefs than they used to be by virtue of an Act of Parliament made for that very Purpose  Their Employment is chiefly Hunting for their Food tho' they also breed large Quantities of Black  Cattle with which they pay their Lairds or Leaders the Rent of the Lands These Cattle are driven annually to  England  to be sold and are bought up chiefly in the Counties of  Norfolk Suffolk  and  Essex  as I have mentioned in several Places in my  Tour    There are many little Towns and Villages besides Gentlemens Seats in  Caithness  as far North as it is But the People are more addicted to good Living within Doors than to shewy Edifices or fine Seats The best House in it is Castle  Sinclair  so called from the Name of the Earls of  Sinclair  whose Seat it is and they have several other Castles in the County The Lord  Sinclair  of  Ravensheugh  in  Fife  is chief of the Name His Ancestors formerly possessed  Orkney  and  Shetland  and were allied to the Royal Family of  Denmark  But one of the Family squandered away his Estate and among the rest these Islands and got for it the inglorious Title of  William the Waster  The chief Town and Royal Burgh in  Caithness  is  Wick  or  Weich  whence it is called the Shire of  Weich  This Town lies conveniently for Trade and has a good Harbour for Ships on the Eastern Coast It is the Residence of the Sheriff or his Officer  Thurso  another Town with a good Harbour lies also on the Northern Coast in a little Bay The Isles of  Orkney  and  Shetland  I refer to the Account of the Isles  And I shall observe once for all that I am the more particular in my Description of these Northern Parts of  Scotland  because they are least known and less valued and esteemed than they deserve  This County is surrounded with the Sea and those two great Inlets of Water mentioned above called the  Ness  and the  Abre  So that it forms a Peninsula by means of that small Neck of Land of about eight Miles long which Mr  Camden  calls the  Garrow  or  Glengarrough  others  Glengary  Were  it not for this the whole Division of the  Northland  would be a distinct Island separated from all the rest of  Great Britain  as effectually as the  Orkneys  or the Isle of  Skye  is from this  That Part which lies to the East is open to the Sea without Cover the West and the North are in a manner surrounded with Outworks as a Defence to break off the raging Ocean from the North for the Western Islands on one Side and the  Orkneys  on the other lie as so many advanced Fortifications or Redoubts to combat that Enemy at a Distance  From  Dunrobin  Castle you have nothing of Note offers itself either by Sea or Land but an extended Shore lying North and South without Towns and without Harbours and as there are none of the former to be found so there are none of the last wanting  The Land thus extended lies North and South to  Dungsbyhead  which is the utmost Extent of it on the Eastside of  Britain  North and is distant from  Cromarty  Leagues North From this Point of  Dingsby  or  Dungsbyhead  as I observed before of  Buchan  and  Winterton  the Sailors take their Distances and keep their Accounts in their going farther North  e g  From this Point of  Dingsbyhead  to the  Fairisle  or  Faro  which is the first of  Shetland  or the last of the  Orkneys  call it which you will for it lies between both is Leagues or Miles  From the same  Dungsbyhead  to  Sumburghhead  that is to  Shetland  is Leagues or Miles and to  Lerwick  Fort in  Shetland  Miles  Thus from  Buchanness  to  Sumburghhead  in  Shetland  is Leagues  And from  Wintertonness  near  Yarmouth  on the Coast of  Norfolk  to  Buchanness  on the Coast of  Aberdeen  is just Leagues So from  Winterton  to  Shetland  is Leagues or Miles  I am now to observe that we are here at the extremest Point of the Island of  Great Britain  and  that here the Land bears away West leaving a large Streight or Sea which they call  Pictland  or  Pentland Firth  and which divides between the Island of  Great Britain  and the Isles of the  Orkneys  a Passage broad and fair for 'tis not less than five Leagues over and has a sufficient Depth of Water for Ships to sail in But the Tides are so fierce so uncertain and the Gusts and sudden Squalls of Wind so frequent that very few Merchant Ships care to venture thro' it and the  Dutch EastIndia  Ships which come North about as 'tis called in their Return from  India  keep all farther off and chuse to come by  Fairisle  in the Passage between the Islands of  Orkney  and  Shetland  whither they generally send their Men of War to meet them being sure of not missing them in so narrow a Passage  But the Passage here is much broader being at least nine Leagues from North  Ranalsha  the farthest Island of the  Orkneys  to  Fairisle  and five more from  Fairisle  to  Shetland  So that it is Leagues clear open Sea between the  Orkneys  and  Shetland  with only a small Island in the Way which has nothing dangerous about it  In the Passage between the Land's End of  Britain  and the  Orkneys  is a small Island which our Mariners call  Stroma  Mr  Camden  and others  Sowna  and is much spoken of as dangerous for Ships But I see no room to record any thing of that kind any more than the Report that it is haunted by Witches and Spirits which draw Ships on Shore to their Misfortune  At  Dungsbyhead  is the most Northerly Land of  Great Britain  where in the Month of  June  after a clear Day we could see to read the smallest Print and to write distinctly all Night long without the Help of a Candle  No wonder the antient Mariners be they  Phoenician  or  Carthaginian  who knew nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies when they were  driven thus far were surprised to find they had lost the steady Rotation of Day and Night which they thought had spread over the whole Globe They imagined the  Elysian  Fields must lie this Way when they found they were come already to the Realm of everlasting Day  From hence West we go along the Shore of the  Firth  which they call  Pentland  where is the famous House called  John a Grot  's We set our Horses Feet into the Sea on the most Northerly Land as the People say of  Britain  tho' I think  Dungsbyhead  is as far North 'Tis certain however the Difference is but very small being either of them in the Latitude of ⅙ North and  Shetland  reaching above two Degrees farther The Dominions of  Great Britain  are extended from the Isle of  Wight  in the Latitude of Degrees to the Isles of  Unsta  in  Shetland  in the Latitude of Degrees Minutes being Degrees or full Miles in Length which Island of  Unst  or  Unsta  being the most remote of the Isles of  Shetland  to the Northeast lies Leagues from  Wintertonness  in  Norfolk    Here we found however mountainous and wild the Country appeared the People extremely well furnished with Provisions especially four Sorts in great Plenty two of them sufficient for a common Table the other two the Splendor of the greatest  Very good Bread as well Oat Bread as Wheat tho' the last not so cheap as the first  Venison exceeding plentiful and at all Seasons young or old which they kill with their Guns whereever they find it for there is no Restraint on which Account all the Highlanders have Firearms and become excellent Marksmen  Salmon in such Plenty as is scarce credible and consequently so cheap that to those who have any Substance to buy with it is not worth giving  themselves any Trouble to catch it This they eat fresh in the Season and at other times cured by being dried in the Sun and so preserved all the Year  They have no want of Cows and Sheep but the latter are so wild that sometimes were they not by their own Disposition used to flock together they would be much harder to kill than the Deer  From hence to the West Point of the Passage to  Orkney  is near Miles which may be called the End of the Island of  Britain  which faces directly to the North Pole so that the Tail of the  Great Bear  is seen just over your Head The Day is here in Summer said to be Hours long the Sun remaining so long above the Horizon and when he is set he makes so small an Arch of a Circle below the Horizon that it is much above a Twilight all the Night but it must be remembered that the dark Nights take in Winter their Turn and are protracted to as great a Degree  Yet it is observable here that they have more temperate Winters generally speaking than we have in the most Southerly Part of the Island and particularly the Water in some of the Rivers as in the  Ness  for Example never freezes as I have observed before which is accounted for from the Nearness of the Sea which filling the Air with salt Vapours sheathes as it were the acute Particles of the Cold  For the same Reason the Snows are not so deep nor do they lie so long upon the Ground as in other Places The Summits indeed of the high Hills whither these Vapours cannot reach are continually covered with Snow and perhaps have been so for many Ages so that this Country if any in the World agrees with the following Description  Vast wat'ry Lakes which spread below  And Mountains cover'd with eternal Snow  On the most inland Parts of this Country especially in the Shire of  Ross  they have vast Woods of Firtrees for or Miles in Length not planted by Mens Hands as I have described in the Southern Part of  Scotland  but as they came out of the Hands of Nature and nourished by her Handmaid Time If we may believe the Inhabitants they are large enough to make Masts for the biggest Ships and yet are of no Service merely for want of the Convenience of Watercarriage to bring them away But methinks rather than they should remain an useless Burden to the Earth they might be cut down and burnt from whence might be drawn vast Quantities of Pitch Tar Rosin Turpentine  c  which is of easier Carriage and would well answer the Trouble Indeed an Attempt has been made of this kind for Potash but it did not succeed rather thro' the Fault of the Undertakers at  London  than any thing else  And now leaving the Northern Prospect we pass the opposite Point West from  Dungsbyhead  and which the People call  Farrohead  tho' Mr  Camden  calls these two Points by two different Names The East Point or  Dungsbyhead  he calls  Virvedrum Promontorium  The West Point or  Farrohead  he calls  Sarvedrum Promontorium    From hence the vast Western  Atlantick  Ocean appears for which the Geographers have not agreed upon a Name there being no Country to derive it from  And now we were to turn our Faces South for as to the Islands of this Sea which make the fourth Division of  Scotland  as I mentioned before I shall take notice of them under one Head in the Conclusion of my  Tour    In our Attempt to come down to the Southward by the Coast of  Tayne  and the Shire of  Ross  we should have been extremely disappointed and perhaps  have been obliged to get a Ship or Bark to have carried us round the Isle of  Skye  into  Lochaber  had it not been for the extraordinary Courtesy of some of the Gentlemen of the Country  On the other hand we unexpectedly met here some  English  Men who were employ'd by Merchants in the South to take and cure a large Quantity of Whitefish and afterwards of Herrings on account of Trade Here we had not only the Civility of their Assistance and Accommodation in our Journey but the Pleasure of seeing what Progress they made in their Undertaking  As for the Herrings the Quantity of them was prodigious The Shoal was beginning to come when we first came to the Head of  Pentland Firth  and in a Fortnight's time the Body of their numberless Shoals began to appear but before we left the Coast you would have ventur'd to say of the Sea as they do of the River  Tibiscus  or  Thiesse  in  Hungary  that it was one third Water and two thirds Fish The Operation of taking them could hardly be called Fishing for they did little more than dip for them into the Water and take them up I make no Scruple to say that if there had been Ships to have loaded with them they might all have been filled The Fish did not seem to stay but passed on to the South that they might supply other Parts and make way also for those innumerable Shoals which were to come after  Had the Quantity of Whitefish been any way proportioned to the Herrings there would no doubt have been such Encouragement to the Merchants that they would never have given it over but they found it would not fully answer Not but that there were great Quantities of Cod and the Fish were sizeable and good but as they are taken with Hook and Line they could not with any Dispatch get a sufficient  Loading or lay up enough in large Quantities in the Season  The Bay of  Tayne  is unsafe for Ships runs a great way up into the County divides  Rosse  from  Sutherland  and ends at the Promontory of  Tarbat  We found the Town of  Tayne  and some other Villages tolerably well inhabited and some Trade also occasioned principally by the Communication with the Western Islands and also by the Herringfishing the Fishingboats from other Parts often putting into those Ports for all their Coast is full of Loughs and Rivers and other Openings which make very good Harbours for Shipping and what is remarkable some of those Loughs are infinitely full of Herrings even where as they tell us they have no Communication with the Sea so that they must have in all Probability been put into them alive by some particular Hands and have multiplied there as we find at this Time if they have not some Communications with the Sea which are not discovered to the Inhabitants  We could understand no more of what the People commonly said on this Side than if we had been in  Morocco  all the Remedy we had was that we found most of the Gentlemen spoke  French  and some few broad  Scotish  It was indeed upon other Accounts much for our Convenience to make the common People believe we were  French    Should we go about here to give you an Account of the Religion of the People in this Country it would be an unpleasant Work and perhaps scarce gain Credit You would hardly believe that in a Christian Island as this is said to be there should be People who know so little of the Christian Religion as not to distinguish  Sunday  from a common Day of Labour or the Worship of God from an ordinary Meeting for Conversation I am unwilling to record so ungrateful a Truth which may in time find  Redress but I cannot but say that his Majesty's Gift of  l  paid annually to the Assembly of  Scotland  for sending Ministers or Missionaries for the propagating Christian Knowledge in the  Highlands  is certainly one of the most needful Charities that could have been thought of and truly worthy of a King and if prudently applied as there is Reason to believe it is may in time dispel that Cloud of Ignorance that has so far overspread this unhappy Part of the Country The People have the  Bible  in their own Language the IRS and the Missionaries are obliged to preach to them and examine and catechise their Children in the IRS Language so that we are not to despair of having this Country as well instructed in time as other Parts of  Britain    The Shire of  Tayne  with the little Shire of  Cromarty  and part of the Shire of  Inverness  comprehends the whole Country called  Rosse  The first Tract towards the Southwest in the County of  Rosse  is  Kintail  separated from the Isle of  Skye  by a narrow Firth Next is a little Track called  Glenelebeg  the paternal Estate of the Earl of  Seaforth  whose chief Seat is called  Castle Ylendoven  lying in an Island of the abovementioned Firth Farther North on the same Coast lies  Lochew  with thick Woods where Iron was formerly made A little farther North  Lochbrien  runs into this County and is remarkable for its noble annual Fishery of Herrings  The Peninsula which lies betwixt the Bay of  Cromarty  and  Murray  is called  Ardmeanach  upon the Shore of which stands the Town called  the Chanonry of Ross  formerly a Bishop's See It is pleasantly situated in a Valley betwixt fruitful Hills It had once a stately Cathedral and Castle where the Bishop dwelt Here the late Earl of  Seaforth  had a noble House  Beaulieu  formerly a pleasant and rich Abbey lies near the Mouth of the River  Farrar  and is now possessed by the Lord  Lovat  The Earl of  Seaforth  had near it a Castle called  Kildun  There are other Seats of antient Families in this County which my Compass will not let me describe and I shall mention them at the latter End of my  Tour  in a general List that you may be enabled to form an Idea of the numerous Families of Gentry which  Scotland  produces  On this Coast is the Isle of  Skye  lying from the Westnorthwest to the Eastsoutheast and bearing upon the main Island only separated by a narrow Streight of Water something like as the Isle of  Wight  is separated from the County of  Southampton  We left this on our Right and crossing the Mountains came with as little Stay as we could to the Loughs called  Lochyol  and  Lochlochy  which run thro' that large Country called  Lochaber  that is  ver  the Lochs and which some affect to call the River  Aber  or  Abre i e  the Water which as I said above assists with  Loughness  or  Lochness  to separate the North Land of  Scotland  from the middle Part  This is a long and narrow Inlet of the Sea in Length above Miles the Depth unknown which opening from the  Irish Sea  Southwest meets the River  Abre  or as the  Scots  much more properly express it the Water of  Abre  for it is rather a large Lake or  Loch  than a River and receives innumerable small Rivers into it It rises in the Mountains of  Ross  or of  Glengary  within five or six Miles from the Shore of the  Lochness  or the Water of  Ness  which is a long and narrow Lake like itself and as the  Ness  runs away East to  Innerness  and so into the great Gulph called  Murray Firth  so the  Abre  becoming presently a  Loch  or Lake always goes away more to the Southward and sloping Southwest runs into the  Irish Seas  as above  Lochaber  is Miles in a strait Line from  Inverlochy  to  Inverness  and is one of the most barren Countries in  North Britain  tho' the People have Wood Goats and Deer in Plenty  Glenco  is almost the only Town in it noted for the barbarous and inhuman Massacre perpetrated there by K  William  's Soldiers quartered in those Parts and who cut off Men Women and Children without Mercy A Massacre that made a great Noise and was universally detested and what made it still the more odious was that the Commander in that bloody Work found Friends enough to screen him from the Inquiry that was attempted to be made into the horrid Fact in order to find out who gave him his Orders for it  Lochaber  is noted in History for  Banco  its gallant Thane about the Year who was murdered by the Tyrant  Macbeth  because of a Prophecy  That his Posterity should enjoy the Crown for a long Series of Years  Which accordingly happened for his Son flying into  Wales  married the Prince of  North Wales  's Daughter by whom he had  Walter  afterwards Steward of  Scotland  from whom the Royal Family of  Stuart  was descended It was on this Story that our celebrated  Shakespeare  founded his Tragedy called  Macbeth    On this Water of  Abre  just at the Entrance of the  Loch  was antiently a Fort built to curb the  Highlanders  on either Side called  Inverlochy  It was formerly of great Strength and yet often destroy'd by the  Danes  and  Norwegians  And at the Revolution King  William  caused it to be rebuilt or rather erected a new Fort there which is called  Castle William  as the Village is  Maryburgh  and there is always a good Garison kept in it for curbing the  Highlanders  It is so situated that tho' it may indeed be blocked up by Land and distressed by a  Siege yet as it is open to the Sea it may constantly receive Supplies by Shipping  From  Inverlochy  to  Lochness  has General  Wade  with the most commendable Industry and Pains thro' almost inaccessible Mountains and Mosses and Morasses made a most convenient Road which even surpasses the County consider'd what the  Romans  had done with their several Military Ways and shews that the Soldiery might be made useful even in Times of Peace and rather a Benefit than a Burden to the Country and at the same time so inure them to Toil Labour and Hardiness as would render them fitter for their Country's Service in Time of War To defend this Road from the Rage of the  Highlanders  and at the same time to keep them in Awe the General built a regular Fortification which is called  Fort Augustus  By this means the  Highlands  which before were inaccessible but by  Highlanders  who eluded always the Resentment of their Pursuers are easily entered and traversed at the Pleasure of the King's Forces and even the noted  Rob Roy  himself so famous for his Excursions and Plunders on the  Lowlands  and the King's Friends and who notwithstanding the Proclamations and Rewards issued for apprehending him could never be taken were he alive would not be able now to find a Place of Refuge from his Pursuers And this must be in time a great Help to the civilizing of the  Highlanders  as the Schools established among them of which more byandby will be another  At this Place we take our Leave of the Third Division which I call the North Land of  Scotland  for this Fort being on the Southside of the  Lochaber  is therefore called  Innerlochy  as the other for the like Reason was called  Innerness    We have nothing now remaining for a full Survey of  Scotland  but the Western Part of the Middle  Division of  Scotland  and this tho' a large Country yet affords not an equal Variety with the Eastern Part of the same Division  To traverse the Remainder of this Country I must begin upon the  Upper Tay  as we may justly call it where I left off when I turned away East and here we have in especial manner the Countries of  Badenach Athol  and  Braidalbin  This is a hilly Country indeed but as it is water'd by the  Tay  and many other pleasant Rivers which fall into it there are several fruitful Valleys interspersed among the Hills nor are even the  Highlands  themselves or the  Highlanders  the Inhabitants any thing so wild untaught or untractable as we have been made to believe and as are to be found in the North Land Division that is to say in  Strathnavern Ross Tain  c  The Duke of  Athol  is Lord I had almost said King of this Country and has the greatest Number of Vassals of any Nobleman in this or any Part of  Scotland    The late Duke was always an Opposer of the Union in the Parliament holden at  Edinburgh  for passing it into an Act but he did not carry his Opposition to a Height of Tumult and Rebellion If he had as some were forward to have had him done he would possibly at that time have bid fair to have prevented the Conclusion of it But the Hour was come when the Calamities of War which for so many hundred Years had vexed the two Nations were to have an End and tho' the  English  Government had never less Power than then in  Scotland  yet the Affair was carried thro' with a high Hand all the little Tumults and Disorders of the Rabble as well at  Edinburgh  as at  Glasgow  and other Places being timely suppressed and others by prudent Management prevented  The Duke has several fine Seats in this Country as first at  Dunkeld  upon the  Tay  which I mentioned before where there was a Fight between the regular Troops and the  Highlanders  in the Beginning of the Reign of King  William  another at  Huntingtour  in the  Strathern  or Valley of  Ern  where the Duke has a fine Park and great Store of Deer which may be called his Huntingseat whither he sometimes retires for Sport  He has another Seat at the Castle of  Blair  farther North and beyond the  Tay  on the Edge of  Braidalbin  upon the Banks of a clear and fine River which falls into the  Tay  a few Miles lower  The Country of  Braidalbin  has not so much as a single Village in it of ten Houses yet from its  Latin  Name  Albania  gives ofttimes the Title of Duke to some of the Royal Family 'tis seated very near the Centre of  Scotland  and is alledged to be the highest Ground in it for that the Rivers which rise here are said to run every Way from this Part some into the  Eastern  and some into the  Western  Seas  The  Grampian  Mountains here are said to cut thro'  Scotland  As the Country is rough and uncultivated the Inhabitants are a hardy Race of Men who make excellent Soldiers when they are listed abroad in regular and disciplined Troops and I must add that they are much civilized from what they were formerly These Mountains abound with Flocks of Black Cattle Sheep Horses and Goats The Beef and Mutton are of a delicious Taste and the Wool is valued for its Whiteness and Softness  The Duke of  Athol  tho' he had not till of late an Estate equal to some of the Nobility yet was Master of more of the Superiorities as they are called here than many of those who have twice his Estate and I have been told that he can bring a Body of above Men together in Arms at very little Warning  The Pomp and Grandeur in which this noble Person lives is not to be imitated in  Great Britain  for he is served like a Prince and maintains a greater Equipage and Retinue than five times his Estate would support in another Country  The Duke has also another Seat in  Strathern  which is called  Tullibardin  and which gives Title of Marquis to the eldest Son of the House of  Athol  for the Time being At the lower Part of this Country the River  Ern  falls into the  Tay  and greatly increases its Waters This River rises far West on the Frontiers of the Western  Highlands  near  Glengyl  and running thro' that pleasant Country called  Strathern  falls into  Tay  below  St Johnston    The present Duke is the only Peer that I know of that is so by Statute rather than Patent for his eldest Brother the Marquis of  Tullibardin  being attainted for his Adherence to the  Pretender  the Title would of course have failed but that together with the Estate it was settled by Act of Parliament on the second Brother who is also Lord of or King in the  Isle of Man  and also Lord  Strange  of  Knocking  to both which he succeeded by the Death of his Cousin  James  late Earl of  Derby    Soon after the  Ern  shoots forth from the Mountains it spreads itself into a  Loch  as most of those Rivers do called  Lochern  and then runs by  Duplin  Castle the Seat of the Earl of  Kinnoul  whose eldest Son is thence called Lord  Duplin  The present Earl of  Kinnoul  when Lord  Duplin  married the Daughter of the Earl of  Oxford  when Lord High Treasurer of  England  and was on that Occasion made a Peer of  Great Britain  by the Title of Lord  Hay  of  Peperdon  His Estate here is a very good one but not attended with Vassals and Superiorities as I observed the Duke of  Athol  's is The several Owners of this Seat having been pretty  much used to reside in it have adorned it at several times each according to his particular Genius It has lately received a new Decoration two Wings being added for Offices as well as Ornament  The old Building is spacious the Rooms large and Ceilings lofty filled with Furniture suitable to its outward Magnificence particularly with abundance of fine Paintings some of the Royal Family among which is one of King  Charles  I with a Letter in his Hand held out to his Son the Duke of  York  afterwards King  James  VII which they said he was to have carried to  France  There is also a Statue in Brass of the same King on Horseback a Picture of  Oliver Cromwell  another of General  Monk  both from the Life There is also a whole Length of that Earl of  Kinnoul  who was Lord Chancellor of  Scotland  in the Reign of King  James  VI and King  Charles  I with several other Pieces of  Italian  Masters of great Value  Duplin  Castle is remarkable also for the greatest Defeat the  Scots  ever received from the  English  in the Reign of  Edward Baliol  whom the  English  came to assist In this Battle fourscore of the Family of  Lindsay  perished and of the Family of  Hay  so many that the Name had been extinguished had not the Chief left his Lady with Child  From this Place we went to  Brechin  in  Angus  formerly mentioned an antient Town with a Castle finely situated but the Grandeur of it is lost the Family of  Panmure  to whom it belonged chiefly having forfeited it in the late Rebellion  Here I shall mention the Cataract near  Blair Drummond  on the  Keith  which empties itself into the  Tay  which makes so great a Noise among the Rocks that it stuns those who come near it  We were now after a long Mountainramble come down to the  Lowlands  and into a pleasant and agreeable Country but as we had yet another  Journey to take Westward we had a like Prospect of a rude and wild Part of  Scotland  to go thro'  The  Highlands  of  Scotland  may be divided into two Parts the West  Highlands  and the North  Highlands  the latter I have spoken of at large containing the Countries of  Athol Lochaber Badenach Strathspey Innerness Ross Sutherland  and  Strathnavern  together with the Isles of  Skye Lewis  c  The West  Highlands  contain the Shires or Counties of  Dunbritton  or  Dunbarton  alias  Lenox Bute  and  Argyll  which last contains the Districts of  Cowal Knapdale Lorn  and  Cantyre  the Isles of  Mull Jura Isla  c  Braidalbin  is sometimes reckoned a Part of the North and sometimes of the West  Highlands    On the Banks of the River  Ern  lies a very pleasant Vale which continues from the  Tay  quite up to the  Highlands  called by  Claudian Glacialis Ierne  but now according to the Usage of  Scotland Strathern  or the Vale of  Ern  'Tis an agreeable Country has many Gentlemens Seats on both Sides the River but being near the  Highlands  has often suffered by Depredations in former Times  In it are many  Roman  Camps particularly one at  Ardoch  besides a  Roman  Highway towards  Perth  Several  Roman  Medals have also been found there and of late two  Tabulae  curiously enamelled with a Sepulchral Stone The  Ochilhills  which run along the South Parts of  Perthshire  abound with Metals and Minerals particularly they find good Copper and  Lapis Calaminaris  and at  Glenlion  they meet with Lead Here is great Want of Coal but their excellent Peat and abundance of Wood supply that Defect  The Family of  Montrose  whose Chief was sacrificed for the Royal Cause in the late Civil Broils had a strong Castle here called  Kincardin  which was demolished in those Wars and is not rebuilt The  Castle of  Drummond  is almost in the same Condition b  ng deserted by its Owners the two late Earls of  th  Father and Grandfather of the present Earl were forced into Exile for adhering to the late King  James  II and the  Pretender  King  James  had the latter in such Esteem that he not only made him a Duke and Knight of the Garter but Governor to the  Chevalier    The Western  Highlands  properly so called are the only remaining Part of  Scotland  which as yet I have not touched upon This is that particular Country which a certain Man in King  James  II's Time called the Kingdom of  Argyll  complimenting King  James  upon having conquered two Kings when he suppressed the Duke of  Monmouth  whom in Derision they called the little King of  Lime  and the Earl of  Argyll  whom they called with much more Propriety the great King of the  Highlands    But tho' the greatest Part of these Western  Highlands  may be said to be subject to the House of  Argyll  or to speak more properly to the Family or Clan of the  Campbells  of whom the Duke of  Argyll  is the Chief yet some of the Western Gentlemen are not so blindly guided by their Chiefs as those in the North nor when led on are they so apt to commit Outrages and Violence  But tho' the People are different in these Western and Northern  Highlands  the Countries are much alike only in the former there are not such extensive Woods of Firtrees nor such Quantities of large Eagles  The People also dress alike in both in the  Plaid  and the  Trouse  go naked from below the Knee to the Midthighs wear a Durk and a Pistol at their Girdle and a Target at their Shoulder  Some reckon the Shire of  Braidalbin  to belong as I have said to these Western  Highlands  not that it is West in its Situation for it is rather North but  I suppose because one Part of it is inhabited by the  Campbells  whose Clan as I have observed generally possesses most of the West  Highlands    But if they claim the Country they will have no Reason to boast of the People who are if I may give my Opinion some of the most barbarous and illgoverned of all the  Highlands  of  Scotland  desperate in Fight fierce in Conversation apt to quarrel mischievous and even Murderers in their Passion  At the Fight which happened at  Gillekranky  in  Athol  against the Viscount of  Dundee  they tell us a Story of a Combat between an  English  Soldier and a  Highlander  The  Englishman  understood the Backsword very well but the  Scotchman  received all the Blows upon his Target and yet at the same time laid so hard at his Antagonist with his Broadsword that he cut him in two or three Places at which the  Englishman  enraged rather than discouraged cried out to him  You Dog come out from behind the Door and fight like a Man  but the  Scot  tho' as brave as the other knew better things he pursued him in short so closely that he was just going to kill him when some of the Regiment that saw him distressed came up and rescued him and took the  Highlander  Prisoner  It is hard to say whether the Northern or Western  Highlanders  make the best Soldiers 'Tis certain they both of them are defrauded of an Honour due to them when we attribute several gallant Atchievements to the  Irish  Battalions Abroad which were performed by the  Scots  Thus in particular 'tis said the  Irish  Troops beat the  Germans  out of  Cremona  after they had got Possession of the Town and had taken the  French  General the Marshal  Viller  y  Prisoner That the  Irish  Battalions in the  Spanish  Service behaved gallantly in  Sicily  and so on many extraordinary Occasions Now tho' it is true that  the  Scots  came originally from  Ireland  yet 'tis to be observed that these Soldiers were most of them  Scots Highlanders  who upon all Occasions get over into  France  there list among the  Irish  Troops nay in the late Wars it has been observed whole Regiments of  Highlanders  have been raised for the Service who when they were got Abroad would take the first Opportunity to desert and go over to the  French  and so list in the  Irish  Battalions their original Countrymen and who still speak the same Language  Leaving the Country about  Brechin  and the  Lowlands  of  Strathern  we went away West but were presently interrupted by a vast inland Sea rather than a Lake called  Lochlomond  It is indeed a Sea and look'd like it from the Hills from whence we first descry'd it It contains thirty Islands three of which have Churches and several of the rest are inhabited The chief is  Inchmurin  about two Miles and a half in Length fruitful in Corn and Grass and abounds with Deer which the  Scotish  Kings were accustomed to hunt there The others most remarkable are  Nachastel  so called from the old Castle in it  Inchdavanan  noted for Broom abundance of wild Berries pleasant Habitations Gardens and Fruittrees  Inchonnaugan  noted for Birchtrees and Cornfields  Inchnolaig  noted for Yewtrees which grow nowhere else in these Islands And  Rouglash  where the Laird of  Macfarlan  has a handsome Seat on the Eastside of the Lake  Kilmaronoch  a fine Seat once belonging to the Earls of  Cassils  but now to the Earl of  Dondonald Buchanancastle  and several others  This Lake or Loch is one of the largest in  Scotland  being more than Miles long and generally eight Miles in Breadth tho' at the North End of it 'tis not near so broad It receives many Rivers  into it but empties itself into the Firth of  Clyde  at one Mouth  This Lake abounds with Fish of several Sorts particularly a Sort called  Poans  and by some  Pollacks  peculiar to it a Kind of Eel very delicious to eat This gave Occasion to the Mistake of Authors who said this Lake had Fish without Fins So the Beams fastened together in some Places of the Lake by the Inhabitants and covered with Turf for them to have recourse to in time of War and to move from Part to Part gave Rise to the Fable of floating Islands here  The famous  Grampian  Mountains begin near this Lake and run Northward towards  Aberdeen    The County of  Lenox  on which this Lake lies is in Length about Miles and in Breadth about twenty The lower Part is very fertile in Corn the higher is hilly moorish and more fit for Pasture It is the paternal Estate and Property of the  Stuarts  and extends itself from both Sides the  Levin  which is the River that as I said before empties the  Lochlomond  into the  Clyde  On this Side Eastward  Lenox  joins to  Monteith  which is Part of  Perthshire  and runs up for some Length on the Eastside of the  Loch  and on the Westside it extends to the Edge of the  Lochloing  and a great way North almost to the Mountains of  Lochaber    All our Writers of the Description of  Lenox  inlarge upon its Family of  Stuarts  as proceeding from the Royal Line of  Scotland  and in some respect the Royal Line may be said to proceed from this House  Henry  Lord  Darnley  eldest Son of  Matthew  Earl of  Lenox  having been married to Queen  Mary  by whom he was Father of King  James  the Sixth and First He was most barbarously murdered the Queen was unjustly blamed for it whereas  Murray  projected it  Bothwell  put it in Execution  Morton  and others were privy to it as  the said Earl  Morton  and others who suffered for it declared at the last  From this Earl  Matthew  descended  Charles  Duke of  Lenox  and  Richmond  who dying without Issue in the Estate and Honour devolved to King  Charles  II as Heir at Law which he conferred on his natural Son by the Duchess of  Portsmouth  and to whom he gave the Surname of  Lenox  from whom is descended the present Duke of  Richmond  and  Lenox    The  Buchanans  among many illustrious Names are originally of this County whence the famous  George Buchanan  one of the great Ornaments of his Age for all polite Learning and not hitherto equalled by any Poet or Historian since his Time for smooth and elegant  Latin  But his excessive Bias for the Earl of  Murray  and his inveterate Prejudice against the unfortunate Queen  Mary  has quite lost him the Title of Impartiality insomuch that his History of  Scotland  was condemned by Act of Parliament when first published  Anno  Whence Sir  George Mackenzie  took Occasion to say He was both  Decus Dedecus Patriae  the  Grace  and  Disgrace  of his  Country    Dunbarton  is the County Town of  Lenoxshire  It was once considerable for its Trade which is now much decay'd but is still remarkable for its Castle one of the strongest by Nature in  Europe  being secured by the River on one Side the  Firth  of  Clyde  on the other by an impassable Morass on the third and the fourth is a Precipice Of this Castle the Earl of  Hay  is Governor  Take  Buchanan  's Description of it to the following Effect Betwixt the Conflux of  Clyde  and  Leven  is a Plain about a Mile long at the End of which where the Rivers join is a Rock with two Summits on the Westermost is a Watchtower affording an extended Prospect into the neighbouring  Country The Eastern Summit is lower and betwixt them are Steps cut out of the Rock passable only by one Man at a time When any Part is cut or falls off from the Rock it emits a sulphureous Smell At the upper Part of the Castle is a great Rock of Loadstone The Rock is very steep on all Sides but towards the  Clyde  where the Ascent is more easy and betwixt the two Rocks is a Space of Ground inclosed by Art and Nature which contains many Houses makes a safe Harbour for Ships under Protection of the Castle and opens a Passage for Boats to the very Gate On the Ascent in the Middle are Houses which look like another Castle separated from the former The same serves for a Ditch on the West and the  Clyde  on the South and the Tide comes up to the Eastside and on the North where the Rock is steep is a green Plain Three Wells are in the Castle always flowing with Water besides many Springs so that it may well be deemed impregnable The Town lies about half a Mile from it on the Bank of the  Levin    The  Roman  Wall which begins at  Abercorn  runs thro' this County and ends at  Kilpatrick  on  Clyde  a Regality of the Lord  Blantyre  's  We now entered the large extended Country of  Argyll  or the Western Islands commonly called  the Shire of Innerary  from the principal Town where the Duke of  Argyll  has his Residence It comprehends as I have said  Argyllshire Knapdale Caval Kintyre  and  Lorn  with the Western Isles of  Coll Illcollimkil Isla Jura Lismore Mull Tereff  and  Wyst  It is Miles long and broad It joins to  Perthshire  on the East to  Lochaber  on the Northeast to the Isles on the Northwest and to the  Irish  Sea on the South  Kintyre  is a Peninsula which runs Miles out into the  Irish  Sea and is no more than some say Miles from  Ireland Campbeltown  made a  Royal Burgh by King  William  with a safe Harbour for Ships lies in this County  Camden  says the People of this Part formerly made Excursions into  Ireland  and possessed themselves of the Provinces of  Gline  and  Rowle    Knapdale  joins to  Kintyre  on the North by a narrow Neck of Land scarce a Mile over thro' which the People of the Country draw their small Vessels to avoid sailing round to  Kintyre  It abounds with Lakes and Bays several of which contain Islands and Castles and the Soil is generally fitter for Pasturage than Cultivation yet it produces Corn in great Plenty  Lorn  is the pleasantest and most fruitful Part of the Shire of  Argyll  The Castle of  Dunstafage  stands in this County formerly a Royal Seat where several of the antient Kings are buried The Family of  Campbell  was made Earls by King  James  II of  Scotland  They were a long time Lords Justices General of the Kingdom but surrendered that Office to King  Charles  I on a valuable Equivalent besides having the Jurisdiction of  Argyll  and the Isles and are still Great Masters of the King's Houshold in  Scotland  They derive their Surname from the Castle of  Campbell  and according to  Camden  their Pedigree from the antient Kings of  Argyll  by a long Series of Ancestors The Earl of  Loudon  the Earl of  Braidalbin  the Earl of  Isla  and other great Men are of this Family  The whole Shire of  Argyll  taking in the above Parts has seven Bays of the Sea entering into it called by the Inhabitants  Lochs  the chief is  Lochfyn  famous for the Number and Goodness of its Herrings it is said to be about Miles in Length and at the narrowest Place about four in Breadth  Lochew  according to Bishop  Lesly  is almost as large as  Lochlomond  and contains twelve Islands in one of which is the Castle of  Enconel  in another  that of  Gleurquhart  and where it enters the Sea abounds with Salmon The Seacoast of  Argyll  or as far as  Lochfyn  abounds with high Rocks and black Mountains covered with Heath which afford Pasturage for Black Cattle and Deer The Black Cattle run for the most part wild but are excellent Meat and their Fat when boiled does not congeal as others but continues for some Days like Oil The Inhabitants make great Profit of them by selling them to the  Lowlanders    The Duke of  Argyll  is hereditary Sheriff of this County 'Tis an old Right of this Family that when they marry any Daughter their Vassals are obliged to pay their Portion and are taxed in order to it according to the Number of their Cattle  From the  Mull  of  Cantyre  you see  Ireland  very plain it being not above or Miles from the Point of Land which they call the  Mull  to the Fair  Foreland  on the Coast of  Colrain  on the North of  Ireland  In the Mouth of this Sea of  Clyde  lies a Rock somewhat like the  Bass  in the  Firth  of  Forth  or of  Edinburgh  not for Shape but for this Particular that at the  Bass  the  Solan  Geese are noted to come in the Season of the Fishery and then fly back again This Island is called the  Ailzey    I shall here mention the Isles of  Bute  and  Arran Buchanan  says that of  Bute  is eight Miles long and four broad Bishop  Lesly  that it is Miles long It is fruitful in Corn and Pasturage It has a Royal Burgh called  Rothsay  with an antient Castle From this the Royal Family of  Stuart  is supposed to derive their Origin And Duke of  Rothsay  is now one of the Titles of the Prince of  Wales  It has another Castle called the Castle of  Kermes  and four Churches This Island lies in the Mouth of the  Clyde  eight Miles West from  Arran  and is remarkable for its Herringfishing The Isle of  Bute  gives Title of Earl to a Branch of the noble Family of  Hamilton  who is the chief Proprietor and heretable Coroner of the Island and has a Seat at  Rosa  as  Callartine  has at  Kermes  and  Stuart  of  Ascog  another Queen  Mary  before she married Lord  Darnley  conferred upon him the Title of Duke of  Rothsay  Near  Bute  are two small Islands called  Great  and  Little Cumbrays  the Property of the Earl of  Glasgow    The Isle of  Arran  which with  Bute  make up one Sheriffdom lies also in the Mouth of the  Clyde  Miles in Length and near broad fruitful in Corn and Pasturage It is very well inhabited on the Coast and is a safe and good Harbour covered by  Lamlash  or the  Holy Isle  It has two Churches and several Castles of which that of  Brodich  is the strongest and most noted and is the Residence of the  Hamilton  Family when in these Parts who also have a Forest here containing about Head of Deer and the Island gives Title of Earl to the Duke of that Name The Island has several Rivers in it which abound with Salmon as the Sea about it does with Herrings Cod and Whitings  The People are Protestants speak the  Irish  Language and are still composed of several Tribes or Clans The most ancient are  MacLewis  of  French  Extraction in  English  named  Fullerton  and Lairds of  KirkMichael  where they reside  These two Islands are surrounded with a tumultous and dangerous Sea especially in a hard Southwest Wind which brings the Sea rolling in upon them in a frightful manner But the above Harbour of  Lamlash  stands them in great stead in this Case  Now we are upon these Western Coasts I shall mention that in the Month of  August  an Attempt was made by Diving to come at one of the largest Ships of the  Spanish  Armada stranded in on these Coasts Another was dived for some  Years ago but the Sand being loose it turned to little or no Account The other which was lost near  Portincross  was begun to be searched after by Sir  Archibald Grant  and Captain  Roe  in  August  and the following was the Account that was transmitted to us which we the rather insert as it gives some Notion of the Operation by the Divingengine  The Country People had preserved by Tradition the Spot pretty near where she sunk and gave them all the Information they were able Immediately the Divers went to Work and swept for her which they do thus They have a long Line which they sink with Leads one End of the Rope is fixed to one Boat and the other End to another they row and whatever interrupts them the Diver goes down to make a Discovery They soon happened on the Place where the Ship lay which is scarce a Quarter of a Mile from the Shore in ten Fathom and a Foot Water Captain  Roe  immediately went down and found the Vessel to be very intire to have a great Number of Guns on board but to be full of Sand The first Thing he fixed upon was a Cannon which lay upon the Sand at the Head of the Ship To this he fixed his Tongs which are made of strong Bars of Iron they are open when they are let down and have Teeth which join into one another As soon as they are fixed upon any thing he gives the Signal when they are made to shut and the heavier the Subject the closer they hold The Cannon was drawn up with a good deal of Difficulty it measures full nine Feet is of Brass greenishcoloured but nothing the worse On the Breach there is a  Rose  with an  E  on the one Side and an  R  on the other with this Inscription  Richard and John Philips Brethren made this Piece Anno  But we may be allowed to observe That by the  E R  on the Cannon which denotes  Eliz Regina  and the  Rose  as also the  English  Inscription of the Makers it should seem  to us that it could not belong to the Armada but rather to some  English  Ship that might have been cast away there Ten of these Brass Cannon and ten Iron ones have been since carried into  Dublin  and they hope to recover sixty out of this Ship The Guns were all charged and the Metal of some by lying so long under Water moulders away like Clay  Several People have scraped the Iron Guns which are as mouldy as Bricks and by keeping the Metal some time in their Hands it grows so hot that they are not able to bear it but when it is exposed two or three Hours in open Air it loses all its burning Quality This is accounted for in the following Manner  viz  Dr  Tournefort  a  French  Physician in his  Voyage to the Levant  Part I says It is certain that the Filings of Iron steeped in common Water will grow considerably warm and much more so in Sea Water And if you mingle therewith some Sulphur powdered you will really see this Mixture burn  Sir  Isaac Newton  in the last Edition of his  Opticks Pag  says That even the gross Body of Sulphur powdered with an equal Weight of Iron Filings and a little Water made into a Paste acts upon the Iron and in five or six Hours grows too hot to be touched and emits a Flame  Now it is certain that cast Iron contains a great deal of Bitumen or Sulphur in its Composition and that Iron in its sensible Quality effects Heat and cannot be perceived without the Admission of Air which is the Reason why the Scrapings should grow hot altho' the Guns are actually cold to the Touch  As I have given Accounts of several publick Charities and other laudable Institutions in the Southern Parts of  Britain  it would be inexcusable not to mention the Society in  Scotland  for propagating Christian Knowledge in the  Highlands  it being one of the worthiest Designs of the present Age and as  we shall include in it also a Description of the said  Highlands  and of the  Scots  Islands besides we cannot insert it in a more proper Place It is comprehended in a Letter written  June  from a Gentleman who is a great Encourager of this noble Institution to his Friend and is as follows  "The Extent of the  Highlands  of  Scotland  is much greater than has commonly been imagined From the  Mull  of  Kintyre  to  Farohead  in  Strathnavern  is more than Miles in a strait Line from South to North and from  Farohead  to  John a Grot  's House is above Miles along the North and Northern Coast of the Continent Besides there is a vast Number of inhabited Islands of which some are both large and populous For instance  Jura  is Miles long  Isla    Mull    Skye    LongIsland  comprehending  Bara Southuist Northuist  and  Lewes  and many others from two to Miles in Length The Isles of  Orkney  and  Zetland  are to be considered by themselves for to  Orkney  alone belong thirtythree inhabited Islands one of which is Miles and another in Length In  Zetland  there are about inhabited Islands some of which are six others seven Miles long Many of these Islands lie at considerable Distances from the Continent and from one another and are in Extent about one half of  Scotland    "In this large Track of Country Ignorance and Superstition greatly prevail In some Places the Remains even of Paganism are still to be found and in many others the Reformation from Popery has never yet obtained The Parishes where Ministers are settled are commonly of very great Extent some Miles long and generally divided by impassable Mountains and Lakes so that most of the Inhabitants being  destitute of all Means of Knowledge and without any Schools to educate their Children are intirely ignorant of the Principles of Religion and Virtue live in Idleness and Poverty have no Notion of Industry or Sense of Liberty are subject to the Command of their Popish disaffected Chieftains who have always opposed the propagating Christian Knowledge and the  English  Tongue that they might with less Difficulty keep their miserable Vassals in a slavish Dependence The poorer Sort have only the  Irish  Tongue and little Correspondence with the civilized Parts of the Nation and only come among them to pillage the more industrious Inhabitants They are brought up in Principles of Tyranny and Arbitrary Government depend upon foreign Papists as their main Support and the native  Irish  as their best Correspondents and Allies This has been the Source of all the Rebellions and Insurrections in that Country since the Revolution  "On the other hand they are naturally of a quick Genius of great bodily Strength inured to Hardship Their Country is commodiously situated for the noblest Fishery in the World of which our Neighbours have made immense Profit They have Mines and Woods and great Quantity of Black Cattle and vast Tracks of improveable Land which lie waste for want of Industry in the People and not considering the Advantage of their Situation They are a numerous and prolifick People and if reformed in their Principles and Manners and usefully employed might be made a considerable Accession of Power and Wealth to  Great Britain  Some Clans of  Highlanders  well instructed in the Arts of War and well affected to the Government would make as a  e and formidable a Body for their  Country's Defence as  Great Britain  or  Switzerland  or any Part of  Europe  are able to produce  "In the Year some Gentlemen of  Edinburgh  first considered of proper Methods for civilizing and reforming them and agreed that the setting up of Schools in different and convenient Places for the instructing of their Youth in the  English  Tongue and Principles of the Christian Religion and disposing them to Virtue and Industry would be the most likely and effectual Means They joined in a voluntary Subscription among themselves and engaged as many others in it as they could which laid the first Foundation of this great and publick Design They soon found the Work too heavy a Burden for a few private Hands and made Application to her late Majesty Queen  Anne  who was graciously pleased to approve and recommend the same by her Royal Proclamation in the Year and in granted her Letters Patent constituting and appointing a certain Number of the Subscribers to be a Society or Body Politick by the Name of  The Society in  Scotland  for propagating Christian Knowledge in the Highlands and Islands c  with full Powers to receive Donations of Money  c  and to purchase Lands  c  not exceeding  l  a Year and with the Profits and yearly Interest of the same to erect and maintain Schools with many other Privileges and Regulations The Lords of Session or Judges in  Scotland  according to her Majesty's Commission nominated Subscribers to be the first Members of the Society all of them Persons of the best and most distinguished Characters who at their first General Meeting chose a President a Treasurer a Secretary and other Officers They also chose a Committee of Fifteen who meet every  Month or oftener as they have Occasion There is a General Meeting of the whole Society every three Months when they assume new Members make general Regulations give Orders to the Committee and receive their Accounts All Proceedings both of the Committee and of the General Meeting are recorded in distinct Books which are always open to the Examination of every Contributor The Names of the Contributors are kept in a distinct Register with an Account of the several Benefactions  "In the Year they began to settle Schools in such Places as had never been reformed from Heathenism And their capital Stock having yearly increased by the liberal Contributions of many Persons of all Ranks in  Great Britain  and amounting to above  l  most of which is laid out upon good Security they have increased their Schools in Proportion Their Number at present is about where above are taught  gratis  to read write Arithmetick and Psalmody Many of the poorer Scholars have a weekly Allowance for their Maintenance and Cloaths and Books provided for them Great Care is taken that the Schoolmasters are Men of Probity Capacity and well affected to the Government and they are obliged besides the teaching the Children in the Schools to instruct those in the Principles of Religion who are too old to come to School and at too great a Distance from the Parish Church Many Popish Parents have at length permitted their Children to be instructed  "This Society has appointed Persons of Character and Consideration to be Visitors of their Schools and to examine the Conduct and Diligence of the Schoolmasters and the Proficiency of the Scholars and to transmit Accounts to them at  Edinburgh  All possible Care is taken to  manage the Money to the best Advantage not a Farthing being diverted to any other Purpose and all the principal Officers of the Society serve  gratis  The Success of the Undertaking has answered all the Pains and Expence of the Society There appears a great Disposition in the rising Generation to be instructed many have learned to read the Scriptures and attend Divine Service in  English  where formerly the  Irish  Tongue was only understood Several of the Scholars are capable of assisting the Masters and some of them of being Masters of the Society's Schools Many of them have attained to such Degrees of Knowledge as to be admitted to the Celebration of the Lord's Supper The Face of Reformation and Virtue begins to appear everywhere and there is Reason to apprehend that in a few Years Ignorance Popery and the  Irish  Language will be utterly extirpated and in their stead Virtue Loyalty and Industry will take Place  "Nevertheless the present Fund is far from being sufficient to the Vastness of the Design as appears from the Report of the Commissioners appointed by his late Majesty King  George Anno  to inquire into the State of the  Highlands  and Islands of  Scotland  in pursuance of an Act of Parliament of the preceding Session who gave it as their Opinion That no Method was so likely to reduce these Countries to a State of Peace among themselves and hearty Subjection to the present Government as that of establishing Schools among them and that over and above the present Number one hundred and fifty more were absolutely necessary to render the Design fully effectual  "This Report had so good an Effect that it was enacted  Anno    Georgii  in the Act for vesting the forfeited Estates in Trustees  c  'That a  Sum not exceeding  l  shall be appropriated towards making a capital Stock for a yearly Interest or Income out of the Moneys which shall arise by Sale of the said Estates which are in  Scotland  towards erecting and maintaining Schools in the  Highlands  c And in the Act  Georgii  for laying a Duty on wrought Plate there is a Proviso That nothing therein shall invalidate the said Provision for Schools in the  Highlands  c But notwithstanding this charitable Provision of the Legislature 'tis much to be lamented that neither that Country nor this Society ever reaped any Benefit by it the Produce of the said Estates having been applied to other Purposes whereby the reforming and civilizing of that Country is left to depend very much on private Contribution  "I must not forget to observe That the Society's Charter extends to Popish and Infidel Countries beyond the Seas and that four Missionaries are maintained for converting the native  Indians  in  America  to the Christian Faith three of which are stationed on the Frontiers of  New England  between our Settlements and those of  French Canada  by which Means the  Indians  in those Parts will more easily be kept in Subjection to our Government The Charge of these three is in a great measure defrayed out of an Estate left to the Society by a late worthy Clergyman in  England  for that Purpose The other Missionary is intirely supported at the Society's Charge in the new Colony of  Georgia  where several of the poorer People are gone to reside  "And to render this Design more fully a national Benefit his present Majesty from an earnest Desire to promote the Good of his Subjects in all Parts of his Dominions was graciously pleased in the Year to grant his Royal additional  Charter to cause such Children as they should find proper to be instructed in Husbandry Housewifry and Manufactures The Society is taking all proper Measures for erecting Workingschools and have good Encouragement to hope that the landed Gentlemen in the  Highlands  and Isles will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their Protestant Neighbours in  Ireland  who took the first Hint from their Design but will like them let out and make Grants of small Parcels of Ground to build their Schools and for Kitchengardens and Agriculture and for the raising of Hemp and Flax for the Linen Manufacture which is now so greatly improved in that Country This is the distinct State of the Case in all the Circumstances and Steps of it  "As this Undertaking is not the Work of a Party or Faction but the common Cause of Christianity and an Attempt to civilize vast Numbers of People near half a Million and make them useful to Society who have been in a great measure useless and in some Circumstances very hurtful to it 'tis apprehended That the Wealthy and Welldisposed who have an hearty Zeal for the Honour of God and the Good of the Souls of Men a true Love for their Country and the publick Welfare or a due Concern for the Protestant Religion and the present happy Establishment cannot easily find any Instance of Usefulness more likely to turn to Account or capable of answering more noble and extensive Purposes of Good"  Thus far this Gentleman We shall add That his Majesty gives  l per Annum  toward this noble Design  I shall here subjoin the following List of the principal Seats of the Nobility and Gentry in the respective Counties of  North

Hemprigs  Sir W Dunbar  's Duren  Mr Sinclair  's c  LETTER V  SIR  _I SHALL now present you with as brief and accurate an Account as I can give you of the Islands of most considerable Note lying adjacent or belonging to this Northern Part of the Island of  Great Britain  beginning first with  The Western Isles of  Scotland    THese Islands lie in the  Deucaledonian  Sea and were called by some  Hebrides  The most Southern of them is the  Isle of  MAN which for several Generations has belonged to Families who have been Homagers to the Crown of  England  for it Wherefore I shall pass it by with these Remarks That when it became intirely subject to the  English  it kept a distinct Bishop of its own whose Successors continued the Title of  Episcopi Sodorenses  as well as added that of  Mannenses  as if they had been Bishops of the  Isles  also whose Cathedral was at  Sodor  and as many of the Towns therein are called by  Scots  Names so at present it belongs to a  Scots  Peer  James  Duke of  Athol  who lately succeeded to this Isle as Heir at Law to his Cousin  James  Earl of  Derby    The Isles of BUTE and ARRAN I have already mentioned  AILSA or  Islesay  in the Mouth of the  Clyde  is a steep Rock something resembling the  Bass  in the Mouth of  Forth  being inaccessible in all Places but only by one Pass and not inhabited except at one time of the Year when a great Fleet of Vessels come thither to fish for Cod It abounds with Variety of Seafowl especially  Solan  Geese and has Multitudes of Rabbets It belongs to the Earl of  Cassil  who receives by the Produce of Hogs Fowl Down and Fish about Marks  Scots  yearly from hence  Near the Isle of  Bute  lie two Islands called CUMBRA the  Greater  and  Lesser  the first is about a Mile in length has a Church in it and a Well the Waters of which are reckoned by the Natives good against all Diseases The other Island is less and both belong to  Montgomery  of  Skelmerly  the larger is fruitful in Corn and the smaller abounds with Deer  Near the Isle of  Arran  is FLADA a small Island which abounds with Rabbets  Southwest from  Bute  lies MERNOCK about a Mile long and half a Mile broad fruitful in Corn  About a Mile from the Promontory of  Kintyre  lies AVONA which signifies  a good Harbour  The  Danes  came hither with their Fleets when they were Masters of the Isles  The next remarkable Island is GIGAIA four Miles from  Kintyre  six Miles in Length and a Mile and a half in Breadth The Inhabitants are Protestants There is a Church in this Island and a Sepulchre for the  Macneils  the Proprietors of it  Corkir  which dyes a Crimson Colour and  Crostil  which dyes a Philamote grow upon the Stones here The Soil is good for Pasture and Arable They have also a Medicinal Well which they esteem a Catholicon  A Quarter of a Mile South lies CARY about a Mile in Compass has good Pasturage and abounds with Rabbets It belongs to the Family of  Macalister    JURA lies twelve Miles from  Gigaia  is Miles long and six or seven broad it belongs to the Duke of  Argyll  and makes Part of the Shire of that Name This is very barren but reckoned one of the wholsomest Places in  Scotland  Here Women seldom die in Childbed and one  Macrain  died in the Reign of King  Charles  II who had been  Christmas's  in one House It abounds with many Deer has good Pasturage for other Cattle has many good Springs and one against Nauseousness of the Stomach and Stone Here are two very high Mountains called  The Paps of  JURA which are noted Seamarks for a very great Way From  March  to  September  the Air is perfectly pure There are very good Salmon in the Rivers of this Island They have one Church here called  Killearn  The Inhabitants who speak  Irish  and wear the Plaid and Bonnet are Protestants  Two Miles from  Jura  lies SCARBA four Miles long and one broad noted for its extraordinary Tides and the Longevity of its Inhabitants one of whom a Woman lived Years  Near to these lie many Islands of less Note which I have not room to name LISMORE or  Lessimore  the Seat of the Bishop of  Argyll  who from thence was called  Episcopus Lismorensis  is about eight Miles long and two broad and lies Eastward from  Mull  in the Mouth of  Lockyol  which goes up to  Innerlochy  in  Lochaber    BERNERA formerly a Sanctuary in Popish Times has a noble Wood of Yew In this Isle which is five Miles in Circumference and lies about two Leagues to the South of  Harries  were as Mr  Toland  relates two Ravens which beat off all Birds  of Prey and when their Young are able to fly abroad they expel them also out of the Island but not without many Blows and a great Noise In this Island moreover there is a freshwater Lake called  Lochbruist  where many Land and Seafowl build There were according to the same Author a couple of Ravens like the former in a small Isle near  NorthVist  as also upon the Isle of  Troda  near  Skye    Southwest from  Jura  lies ILA Miles long in some Places eight and in others sixteen broad it abounds with Corn and Cattle has Store of Deer and Lead Mines with Limestone in vast Quantities It has several Rivers that abound with Salmon and other Fish of several Sorts In the Centre of it lies  Lochfinlagan  three Miles in Circumference It abounds with Salmon Trouts and Eels and has an Island in it where  Macdonald  King of the Isles had his Residence and made it the Seat of his Government The Ruins of whose Court are still to be seen here There are several freshwater Lakes in this Island with Forts upon them It has also a Medicinal Well much frequented by the Natives for all Diseases There are several Caves here one of them capable of holding Men The Country is indifferently fruitful It lies lower than  Jura  consequently is wetter and less wholsome The Inhabitants are Protestants There are four Churches and a Chapel in this Island the most remarkable of which is St  Columbus  's Church It gives the Title of Earl to a Son of the Family of  Argyll  but  Campbel  of  Calder  is the chief Proprietor and also Steward of the Crown here  There are many small Islands about this which we cannot mention  Two Leagues North  Ila  lies COLONSA separated from  Oransa  only  de of Flood It is four Miles in Length and a  broad not so fruitful  as the other There is one Church besides two ruinous Chapels in this Isle some freshwater Lakes abounding with Trouts and several Forts The Proprietor is the Duke of  Argyll  and the Inhabitants Protestants  ORANSA is four Miles in Circumference and fruitful in Corn and Grass It has also a Church and a Chapel and had formerly a Monastery dedicated to St  Columbus  The Proprietor is  Macduffi    Farther West lies the small Isle of DOWHIRTA The Natives have a Tradition that  Pygmies  once lived here The Duke of  Argyll  is Proprietor  Northeast from  Ila  lies the Isle of MULL Miles in Length and near as much in Breadth It lies in the Shire of  Argyll  The Air is temperate cold and moist but qualified by fresh Breezes from the Mountains The Natives when the Season is moist take a large Dose of  Aquavitae  for a Corrective and chew a Piece of Charmel Root when they intend to be merry to prevent Drukenness This Island in general affords good Pasturage for Cattle of all Sorts They have a great many Deer and abound with Wildfowl and very fine Hawks Their Horses are little but very sprightly their Black Cattle excellent Meat Their Corn is Barley and Oats It formerly abounded with Wood but most of it is now cut The Heaths besides Pasturage for Cattle afford good Fuel for the Natives The Bay of  Duart  on the Westside is a good Anchoringplace Upon this stands the Castle of  Duart  the Seat of the Head of the antient Family of  Maclean  who were the chief Proprietors of this Island but Sir  John Maclean  having forfeited it is now possessed by the Duke of  Argyll  There are two other Castles and several Anchoringplaces about this Island It has several Rivers which afford Salmon and abound with black Muscles which breed Pearl There are also some freshwater Lakes in it which afford  Trout Eels  c  Several lesser Isles lie about it and in its Bays several of which are very fruitful and some are impregnable The Bay called  Lochleffan  abounds with Herring and Shellfish The Inhabitants of this Isle profess Protestantism and have two Parish Churches besides several ruinous Places formerly used for Devotion In the Sound or Bay of  Mull  betwixt this Isle and  Lochaber  a great Ship called the  Florida  belonging to the  Spanish Armada  was lost in the Year Persons from several Places have often dived for her and found good Account in the Guns and other valuable Effects they have got out of her I have already mentioned  Pag  the further Attempts of this Nature by Captain  Roe    Near this lies the Island of ST COLUMBUS two Miles in Length and about a Mile broad It abounds in all Things produced in this Climate was noted for antient Monuments and particularly as being the Residence of  St Columbus  famous for his Discipline and Sanctity It had two Monasteries one for Men and another for Women besides several Chapels endowed by the Kings of  Scotland  and of the Isles It is called in the  Irish  Language  Icolmkil  some call it  Iona  It contains now about poor Families The Bishops of the Isl  had formerly their Seat here This Island is famous in History for being a Seminary of Ecclesiasticks and in a manner the Mother Church of all the Dominions of the  Scot  and  Picts  and tho' the Abbot was only a Presbyter yet all the Clergy of the Province and Bishops themselves were subject to him as is mentioned by  Bede  The Church dedicated to St  Mary  is intirely demolished and overgrown with Grass and Weeds nor is there any regular Place of Worship in the whole Island Here the Vicar of  S  bee  as Dean of the  Isles  used three or four times a Year to catechize and preach to the People The old Monastery  or College of Monks was a Place of great Sanctity and Privilege of which temporal Privileges the Abbot was Superior and in many things exempt from the Bishop being subject only to the Pope or his Delegates The Bishops of the  Isles  were called  Episcopi Sodorenses  from  Sodor  which is usually said to have been a Village in this Island But I very much question it for some Criticks say it should be  Soterenses  from the Church dedicated  to our Saviour which however seems too learned an Etymology for the Time of building the Church or from St  Ouren  's Church which by Corruption or an easy Transition might soon dwindle from  Sant  urensis  into  Sodorensis  If this Conjecture be true then  St Ouren  's was the  Cathedral  and the Church in the Abbey  Conventual  only  Six Miles West from this Island lies TYRETY eight Miles long and three broad it is reckoned to be the most plentiful of all the Islands in Necessaries of human Life abounding with Corn Cattle Fish and Fowl Here is a freshwater Lake with an Island and an old Castle in it and an Harbour for Longboats which are used in that Country It formerly belonged to the Family of  Maclean  but now to the Duke of  Argyll  There is one Church in this Island called  Sorabi  whereof the Dean of the  Isles  was Minister The People are Protestants they are not very healthy as the Country lies low  Near this are two Islands called KERNIBERG so strong by Nature that a little Art would make them impregnable  About half a League to the Northeast lies the Island of COLL ten Miles long and two broad and is very fruitful It has several Rivulets which afford Salmon and a freshwater Lake that has Trouts and Eels The Proprietor is a Branch of the Family of  Maclean  The Inhabitants are Protestants They have a Notion here that  Tyrety  breeds more Women than Men and  Coll  more Men than Women so that they may people each other without the Assistance of their Neighbours The Coasts of this Island abound with larger Cod and Ling than are to be found on the Coasts of the neighbouring Isles and Continent  North from this lies the Isle of RUM six Miles long and four broad It is mountainous and heathy but the Coast is arable and fruitful It is but thinly inhabited and the Sea Fowl lay their Eggs in such Quantities that in the Spring any one may gather what Number he pleases The Rivulets of this Island afford Salmon and there is plenty of Land and Sea Fowl especially those called  Puffins  There are also abundance of Deer in the Mountains The Proprietor is  Maclean  of  Coll  and the Inhabitants are Protestants  Half a Mile from  Rum  lies CANNEY two Miles long and one Mile broad surrounded with an high Rock but plentiful in Corn and Grass and the Coasts abound with Cod and Ling In the Northend there is a Rock of Loadstone as some think because it disorders the Needle of the Compass when any Ships come near it It has one Church and good Anchorage on the Northeast The Proprietor is one of the  Macdonalds  and the Inhabitants Papists  MUCK lies Southwest of  Rum  is about four Miles in Circumference fruitful in Corn and Grass surrounded with Rocks and noted for good Hawks  EGG lies not far from  Coll  is three Miles in Length and a Mile and a half in Breadth and the Whole pretty good for Pasturage and Cultivation On the Southend of it is a Mountain and on the Top of that a high Rock of about Paces in Circumference with a freshwater Pool in the Middle of it there is only one Pass up to it so that it is a natural Fort On the Southwest Side  of the Isle is a Cave capable of containing some Hundreds of People and there are several Medicinal Wells in this Island The Proprietors are some of the  Macdonalds  the Inhabitants bigotted Papists  North from this lies SKYE Miles long and in some Places in others Miles broad It is separated from the Shire of  Inverness  to which it belongs by a Firth so narrow that a Man may easily call from one Side to the other It is navigable by the largest Ships of War The Current there is so violent that no Vessel is able to sail against it tho' the Wind prove ever so fair so that the Tide must always be observed The way of Ferrying Cows in the narrow Ferry called the  Kyle  where the Tide is very rapid is thus They tie a Withe about the Cow's Lowerjaw and bind five of them together after which a Man in the End of a Boat holds the Withe that ties the foremost and rows over carrying in the Space of a few Hours at Lowwater three or four Hundred Cows The Country is populous the People handsome and very healthy Almost all the Inhabitants of  Skye  are Protestants None of them possess any Land It is very high Ground as well on the Coast as up in the Country where there are seven lofty Mountains which lie near one another almost in the Centre of the Island It has a great deal of arable Land which yields a good Increase so that they supply the neighbouring Continent with Barley and Oats It has many excellent Bays and Harbours for the Conveniency of Fishing and other Trade and about Rivers which afford Salmon  ST COLUMBUS's Lake has an Island and a Chapel in it Most of the Bays abound with Herrings all the Summer the Natives dry and preserve them without Salt for eight Months without any other Art than taking out their Guts tying a Rush about  their Necks and hanging them up by Pairs upon a Rope of Heath across the House Cod Ling Mackrel Haddock Whiting Turbet  c  abound on this Coast as do Oysters and all other Sorts of Shellfish There are many large Caves in this Island from the Roof of some of which there drops a Water which petrifies into a white limy Substance one of them in  Slate  called the  Golden Cave  is said to be seven Miles long There are abundance of old Forts on the Coast which seem to have been erected by the  Danes  they stand on rising Grounds and so near one another that by a Beacon fired on any one of them the Notice of any approaching Danger by Invasion was immediately spread thro' the whole Island There are also several little Houses of Stone built under Ground for hiding People and their Goods in time of War and others above Ground capable only of holding one Person which seem to have been designed for Contemplation There are several of the  Druids  Houses yet intire in the Isle of  Skye  and in some other Isles The Vulgar in the Islands still shew a great Respect for these Houses and never come to the ancient sacrificing Carns but they walk three times round them from East to West according to the Course of the Sun The Cattle here are Horses Cows Sheep Goats and Hogs the Cows frequently feed on the Seaweed and observe the Tide of Ebb for that End as exactly as any Man can do This Island abounds with Land and Waterfowl of many Sorts and among others they have Hawks and Eagles It belongs to Sir  Alexander Macdonald  some of whose Ancestors were called Kings of the  Isles  the middle Parts belong to  Mackinnon  of that Ilk and the Northwest Parts belong to  Macleod  all three Chiefs of their several Clans  SOTABRITIL lies a quarter of a Mile South of  Skye  is five Miles in Circumference full of Bogs  and fitter for Pasturage than Cultivation On the Westside it is covered with Wood The Coasts of this Island abound with Cod and Ling  On the Northside of  Skye  lies SCALPA five Miles in Circumference It has Wood in several Parts of it and is fruitful in Corn and Grass  A little farther North lies RAARSAY seven Miles long and three broad it has much Wood and is fitter for Pasture than Cultivation On the Eastside of it is a Spring which runs down from a Rock and petrifies into a fine white Lime of which it yields great Quantities Here is also a Quarry of good Stone On the Westside are abundance of Caves where People lodge who go thither in the Summer upon the Account of Fishing or Grazing of Cattle There are several Forts in this Island some of which are naturally very strong The Proprietor is a Cadet of the Family of  Macleod  and is as much respected by the Inhabitants as if he were a Prince  A Quarter of a Mile farther North lies RONA three Miles in Length 'Tis fruitful in Pasturage and the Rocks about it are of Hectick Stone  ALSVIG lies on the Southwest Corner of  Skye  is two Miles in Circumference fruitful in Corn and Grass and noted for the vast Shoals of Herrings about it which sometimes entangle the Fishingboats  FLADDA two Leagues distant is but two Miles in Compass but much noted for its Fishing of all Sorts and for big Whales which pursue the Fish on the Coast of it The Sea Fowl called  Coulternebs  are very numerous here and a great Flock of Plovers come hither from  Skye  in the Beginning of  September  and return again in  April  There are several Rocks about this Island particularly one called  The round Table  about half a Mile in Circumference with a freshwater Spring which makes  an impregnable Fort there being only one Way to climb up to it by one Man at a time The Natives of  Skye  and the neighbouring Islands have a peculiar way of curing the Distempers which are incident to them by Simples of their own Product wherein they are successful to a Miracle They have also several Medicinal Wells but I have not room to insist upon these things  Eighty Miles West from  Skye  lie nine Islands the chief of which is VATERSA which beside many other Conveniences has a large Harbour capable of the greatest Ships where at stated times great Numbers of Fishermen meet from the neighbouring Countries  Two Miles from  Vatersa  lies BARRA seven Miles long and three broad called so from St  Bar  the tutelar Saint It is fruitful in Corn and noted for its Codfishing The Sea enters this Island at a small Chanel and afterwards inlarges itself into a round Bay in which is an Island with a very strong Castle It has a good Harbour on the Northeast Side where is Plenty of Fish and the Rivulets on the Eastside abound with Salmon  About a Quarter of a Mile South from  Barra  lies KISMUL the Seat of  Macneil  of  Barra  which is encompassed with a Stone Wall two Stories high within which there is a Tower a Hall a Magazine and other Houses They have a Church in this Island and a Chapel where the  Macneils  are buried The Natives are Papists and generally very ignorant and superstitious  Here are several other less Islands belonging to  Macneil  some of them fruitful enough in Corn and Grass others left for Pasturage and some of them remarkable for fishing of Ling and Cod The Inhabitants are very healthful and hospitable they have abundance of Seafowl and when they kill any of them for Use they salt them with the  Ashes of burnt Seaware which preserves them from Putrefaction  Macneil  holds his Lands of Sir  Alexander Macdonald  of  Slate  to whom he pays  l Scots per Annum  and a Hawk if required and is obliged to furnish him with a certain Number of Men on extraordinary Occasions  Betwixt  Barra  and  Vist  lie fourteen small Islands not very considerable  A little North of  Barra  lies SOUTHVIST Miles long in some Places three and in others four Miles broad The Eastside is mountainous but the West plain and arable The Island abounds with freshwater Lakes which have plenty of Fowl and Fish particularly Trouts and Eels In several of them are Islands with Forts There is one Lake three Miles long into which the Sea has made its way tho' the People did all they could to hinder it The Inhabitants are healthy One Man lately lived Years and retained his Understanding The  Irish  Tongue is here spoken in great Perfection The  Macdonalds  descended from the antient Kings of these Islands are Proprietors and with the Inhabitants profess the Popish Religion The Soil is generally sandy but yields a good Produce of Barley Oats and Rye Ambergris is sometimes found upon the Coast  Betwixt this Island and  Northvist  two Miles North lies BENBECULA The Ground is all plain and sandy betwixt them except two little Chanels about Kneedeep at a Tide of Ebb but the Whole is navigable by Boats at a Tide of Flood and there lie several small Islands on the East of these Chanels  Benbecula  is three Miles long and three broad it has a Bay on the Eastside for small Vessels where Herrings are sometimes taken The East Part of this Island is arable it has several freshwater Lakes well stored with Fish and Fowl and some small Forts upon the Islands in those Lakes The Natives are Papists and the Proprietor is one of the  Macdonalds    A little North of this Island lies  Northvist  belonging to Sir  Alexander Macdonald  nine Miles long and about thirty in Circumference It is fitter for Pasturage than Cultivation on the East Part where it is mountainous but the Westside is plain and arable and where it is not ploughed is covered with Clover Daisy and Variety of other Plants very pleasant to the Sight and of a very fragrant Smell and affords good Pasturage The Grain here is Barley Oats and Rye which yields from ten to thirtyfold and there is no doubt but Wheat would grow here very well This Island has several Bays on the Eastside where Ships may ride the chief of which are  Locheport Lochrona  and  Lochmaddes  the latter is capable of Hundreds of Vessels of the greatest Size Vessels have been loaden with Herrings there in a Season Cod Ling and all Sorts of Fish that frequent the Western Seas are to be found here There is a small Island in this Bay upon which a Magazine was erected for carrying on a Fishery in the Reign of King  Charles  I There is such a Number of freshwater Lakes in this Island as can hardly be believed they are generally well stored with Trouts and Eels and which is more strange with Cod Ling and other Seafish brought in to them by the Springtides These Lakes have many small Islands which abound with Variety of Land and Sea Fowl and some of them have Islands with Forts It has also several Rivers which afford Salmon and some of them speckled with large Scales The Inhabitants are Protestants  There are several other lesser Islands which lie on both Sides of  Northvist  the most remarkable of which is EOUSMIL on the West a Rock about a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference noted for its Sealfishing about the End of  October  where three hundred and twenty are sometimes taken at once  Three Leagues and a half farther West lie nine or ten more Rocks which abound with Sea Fowl and great Numbers of Seals  A little farther North lies BORERA four Miles round it has a freshwater Lake well stored with large Eels This Island affords the largest and best Sort of Dulse It is possessed by the Family of  Maclean    Half a League South from this lies LINGAY which furnishes the neighbouring Islands with Peat for Fewel It has abundance of Black Cattle that make excellent Meat the Natives salt it in the Hides which they say preserves it and makes it taste better than when salted in Casks This Island abounds also with Deer Sea and Land Fowl of all Sorts among the rest with Hawks Eagles and Swans The Inhabitants of  South  and  Northvist  are generally well proportioned and healthful and many of them live to a great Age they are very hospitable and kind to Strangers  The Isle of LEWES derives its Name from the  Irish  Word  Leog  signifying  a Lake  with which this Island abounds it is by the Islanders commonly called the  Long Island  it is near Miles from North to South and from to in Breadth it is reckoned part of the Shire of  Ross  but the Isle of  Lewes  properly so called is but Miles in Length and or broad belonging to the Earl of  Seaforth  It reaches from the North of  Bowlinghead  to the South of  Hassiness  The Southern Part is named  Harries  The Air is temperately cold and moist and the Natives use commonly a Dose of  Usquebaugh  for a Corrective The Island is healthful especially in the Middle from South and North it is arable on the Westside for about Miles on the Coast and is likewise plain and arable in several Places in the East It is fruitful in Corn and yields a good Increase their common Grain is Barley Oats and Rye and they have also Flax and Hemp There are several convenient Bays and Harbours here  particularly  Lochstornvay  on the Eastside in the Middle of the Island the  Birkin Island  seven Miles Southward  Locheolmkil  three Miles farther South  Lochsefort  and  Lochcarlvay  Miles Southwest This Bay is remarkable for great Numbers of Cod Ling and Whales which frequent it and all the Bays and Coasts abound with Cod Ling Herring and all other Sorts of Fish taken in the Western Seas besides Plenty of Shellfish of all Sorts in such vast Numbers that the Inhabitants are not able to consume them Coral and Pearlshells are also found in the Bays and Coasts There are several extraordinary Springs and Fountains in this Island and abundance of Caves on the Coasts which Otters Seals and Fowl frequent in great Numbers That Obelisk if I may call it so in the Parish of  Barvas  in the Island of  Lewes  called  The Thrushelstone  is very remarkable being not only above Feet high but likewise almost as much in Breadth which no other comes near The  Dun  or Fortification built on an Eminence in  St Kilda  which is an old Fort is about Leagues distant from  North Vist  and from the Middle of  Lewes  or  Harries  to be seen only in a very fair Day like a blueish Mist but a large Fire there would be visible at Night as the ascending Smoke by Day In this same Isle where are many such  Duns  North of the Village of  Brago  is a round Fort composed of huge Stones three Stories high that is it has three hollow Passages one over another within a prodigious thick Wall quite round the Fort with many Windows and Stairs  Here also at the Village of  Classerniss  is a Druidical Temple extremely remarkable The Circle consists of Obelisks about seven Feet high each and distant from each other six Feet In the Centre stands a Stone Feet high in the perfect Shape of the Rudder of a Ship Directly  South from the Circle stand four Obelisks running out in a Line another such Line due East and a third to the West the Number and Distances of the Stones being in these Wings the same so that this Temple the most intire that can be is at the same time both round and winged But to the North reach by way of Avenue two strait Ranges of Obelisks of the same Bigness and Distances with those of the Circle yet the Ranges themselves are eight Feet distant each consisting of Stones the th being in the Entrance of the Avenue This Temple stands astronomically denoting the Signs of the Zodiack and the four principal Winds subdivided each into four others by which and the Stones on each side the Avenue representing the Cycle of Years it appears to have been dedicated principally to the Sun but subordinately to the Seasons and the Elements particularly to the Sea and the Winds as is manifest by the Rudder in the Middle  This Island abounds with Cows Horses Sheep Goats and Hogs the Black Cattle are small but very prolifick and make excellent Meat the Horses are likewise smaller than on the Continent but as serviceable for all domestick Uses and live very hard having little to feed upon in the Spring but Seaware The Inhabitants are well proportioned and in general healthful and strong and of a sanguine Complexion they are very quick of Apprehension and Lovers of Poesy and Musick They are dextrous at Swimming Volting and Archery and make stout able Seamen  In a little Island near the greater one of  Lewes  were a couple of Eagles which would never suffer any other of their Kind to continue in the Place driving away their own young ones as soon as they were able to fly The Natives said That those Eagles were so careful of their Habitation that they  never killed any Sheep or Lamb in the Island tho' the Bones of Lambs Fawns and Wildfowl were frequently found in and about their Nests so that they made their Purchase in the opposite Islands the nearest of which is a League distant  There are many other lesser Islands which lie round this the chief of which are GARVE in the Mouth of  Lochcarlvay  a high Rock half a Mile in Compass affording good Pasturage and naturally a strong Fort the two BERNERA's one two Miles and the other four Miles long and four Miles broad both fruitful in Corn and Grass  Near  Carlvay Bay  lie four small Islands which belong to the Inhabitants of  Lewes  who go thither every Summer and bring from thence great Store of Fowls Eggs Down Feathers and Quills one of them is called the ISLAND OF PYGMIES because many little Bones resembling those of Men are digged out of the Ground there  Twenty Leagues from the Point of  Nesse  in  Lewes  lies  Rona  a Mile long and half a Mile broad it has a Hill on the West Part which makes it visible from  Lewes  in the Summertime It was inhabited by about five Families who had the Island and the Fishery about it divided among them and were very exact and nice in their Properties and when their Number increased the Supernumeraries were sent to their Landlord in  Lewes  who once a Year sends the Minister of his Parish and a Servant to visit them and bring his Rents which are paid in Barleymeal sewed up in Skins Sea Fowl and some Fish  c  They have a Chapel dedicated to St  Ronan  in which they repeat the Lord's Prayer Creed and Ten Commandments every  Lord'sday Buchanan  says That the Inhabitants were in his Opinion the only People in the World who never wanted any thing and were satisfied with their Condition having Plenty of all that they desired being equally  ignorant of Luxury and Avarice and possessing thro' their Freedom from Vices that Innocence and Tranquillity of Mind which others can scarcely attain unto by great Labour and with the Help of the best Instructions Mr  Martin  affirms in his  Description of the Western Islands  That antient Race of poor People was all destroyed about Years ago in the following manner First A Swarm of Rats none knows how came into the Island and eat up all their Corn In the next Place some Seamen landed and robbed them of what Provisions they had left By this means they all died before the usual Time of the Arrival of the Boat from  Lewes  upon which another Colony was sent thither  Four Leagues East from  Rona  lies SOULISKER a Rock a Quarter of a Mile in Circumference which abounds with vast Numbers of Sea Fowl particularly  Solan  Geese On this Rock there builds one Fowl not found elsewhere called  Colk  it is less than a Goose and all covered with Down but of different Colours which it casts when it hatches it has a Tuft on its Head resembling that of a Peacock and a Train longer than that of a Housecock There were formerly Churches in  Lewes  and  Harries  and the Islands belonging to them but alas to our Shame may it be said as Papists were prosecuted or discouraged Profaneness gained Ground of Superstition and one sort of Ignorance succeeded another for few or no Ministers being sent with suitable Provision and Encouragement Places of religious Worship became ruinous and the Service of God and the Edification of the People very much neglected so that several Parishes in the  Highlands  and  Isles  at present are or near forty Miles long and very often without any Minister at all  That Part which is called HARRIES produces the same Sorts of Corn but with a greater Increase than  Lewes  The Westside is for the most part arable  on the Coast It has a noble Harbour called  Scalpa  a Mile and a half long and a Mile broad and there are two other Harbours within three Leagues of it which abound with Oysters and other Shellfish They have excellent Springs here some of which are Medicinal one particularly near  Marvag  is excellent for restoring a lost Appetite and one near  Borve  good against the Colick and Gravel There are several Caves on the Mountains and on each side of the Coast and in the middle of a high Rock capable of holding Men has two Wells and but a narrow Pass to it by climbing up the Rock so that in Time of War it is an impregnable Fort There are likewise several antient Forts in this Island The Hills and Mountains abound with Deer which none are allowed to hunt without Leave from  Macleod  the Proprietor  Metricks  a fourfooted Creature about the Size of a large Cat are pretty numerous here their Skins are very fine of a brown Colour and make good Fur and 'tis said the Dung of this Animal yields a Scent like Musk There are abundance of Otters and Seals here great Plenty of Land and Sea Fowl and among others Eagles and very good Hawks The Inhabitants both of  Lewes  and  Harries  are Protestants  There are other Islands of small Extent belonging to the  Harries  the chief of which are BERNERA two Leagues to the South it is five Miles in Circumference very fruitful in Barley and Rye and yields sometimes from to Fold There are two Chapels in this Island  Half a League from thence to the Westward lies PABBAY three Miles in Circumference and fruitful in Corn and Grass It has also two Chapels  Half a League to the North lies SELLAY a Mile in Circumference it yields extraordinary Pasture for Sheep which it fattens very soon and those bred there have very large Horns  TARANSAY a League farther North is three Miles round fruitful in Corn and Grass and yields much yellow Talc  There are several other Islands in the Neighbourhood of two or three Miles in Circumference each all tolerably fruitful in Corn and Pasturage particularly HERMATRA where a Magazine for the Fishery was erected in the Reign of King  Charles  I  Eighteen Leagues West from  Northvist  and from  Harries  lies the Island called ST KILDA or HIRTA as  This Hirta  is the most Northwest so  Dow Hirta  is the most Southwest of all the  Scots  Islands The first properly called  St Kilda  is two Miles long and one broad faced round with a steep Rock except at the Bay on the Southeast where Vessels enter The Land rises high in the Middle and there are several Fountains of good Water on each side the Island Their Grain is Oats and Barley the latter accounted the largest in the  Western Isles  The Inhabitants are about two hundred in Number very well proportioned and comely They are Protestants and very zealous according to their Knowledge which is but small for want of Instruction They are very regular and just in their Conversation and Strangers to Luxury and Excess being ignorant of the Use of Money They have a Chapel where they assemble on the  Lord'sday  to hear the Lord's Prayer Creed and Ten Commandments and neither work themselves nor will allow any Stranger to work on that Day It belongs to the Laird of  Macleod  the Chief of that antient Clan who commonly makes some Cadet of his Family Steward of this Island to receive his Rents which are paid in Fish Fowl Feathers Wool Butter Cheese Cattle and Corn and the Steward's Deputy is in his Absence the chief Man of the Island and generally except when a Minister is sent thither from  Harries  baptizes and  marries They have an Altar and Crucifix in their Chapel which have continued there since the Time of Popery and tho' they pay no Worship to the Crucifix yet they swear decisive Oaths by laying their Hands upon it and take the Marriage Oath in the same manner Not long ago an illiterate Fellow one of the Natives imposed upon their Ignorance by pretending that St  John the Baptist  and the Virgin  Mary  had appeared to him and taught him Sermons Prayers and Hymns the latter he alledged were effectual to secure Women against Miscarriage and his Price for teaching them was a Sheep He told them of a little Hill where St  John  and the Virgin appeared to him And made them believe that if any of their Black Cattle or Sheep came near to taste the Grass of that Hill they must immediately be killed and eaten and it was necessary that he himself should always partake of the Treat He was discovered at last by his lewd Attempts upon several Women and being by  Macleod  's Order transported from thence to  Harries  he made publick Confession of his Imposture in several Churches and seemed to be very penitent but was not allowed to return any more Their Houses are low built of Stone and a Cement of dry Earth and covered with Turf thatched over with Straw They make their Beds in the Walls of their Houses and lie commonly on Straw tho' they have great Plenty of Feathers and Down They live all together in a little Village on the Eastside of the Island in good Harmony are very exact and nice in their several Properties and allow no Encroachment upon one another nor will they admit of it from their Landlord or his Steward but pay exactly what they agree on The Island is naturally strong and with a little Art might be made impregnable There is an old Fort at the Southend of the Bay  In the Island of  St Kilda  is the House of a Druidess built all of Stone without Lime or Morter or Earth to cement it it is also arched and of a conick Figure but open at the Top and a Fireplace in the Middle of the Floor It cannot contain above nine Persons to sit easy by each other From the Side of the Wall go off three low Vaults separated from each other by Pillars and capable of containing five Persons apiece  Just such another House in all respects but much larger and grown over with a green Sod on the Outside is in  Borera  an Isle adjacent to  St Kilda  which was the Habitation of a Druid  At the Northend of  St Kilda  were a couple of Eagles who drove away all others of the same Kind even their own Progeny and brought their Prey from other Parts without plundering the Place of their own Residence  They have two other Islands which belong to them one called SOA about half a Mile from the Westside of  St Kilda  a Mile in Circumference and very high and steep all round  The other is called BORERA lies about two Leagues North of  St Kilda  is about a Mile in Circumference and most of it surrounded with a high Rock All three afford good Pasturage and abound with prodigious Numbers of Sea Fowl from  March  till  September  They have  Solan  Geese in such Numbers that they keep about annually in little Stone Houses built on purpose for them and for preserving their other Fowl Eggs  c  The latter they preserve some Months in the Ashes of Peat and they preserve their Fowl without Salt They eat the  Solan  Geese Eggs raw and say they are good Pectorals They have another Bird here called  Fulmar  about the Size of a Moorhen it picks its Food out of live Whales and other Fishes When any one approaches them they spout out  pure Oil from their Bills which the Natives have a way to catch when they surprise the Fowl and make use of it for their Lamps and likewise as a Remedy against Rheumatick Pains Aches and other Distempers It serves them also for Vomits and Purges for Swellings or Strains and discussing of Tumours in all which Cases they say it is very successful Both Sexes have a Genius for Poesy are very hospitable to Strangers and charitable to their own Poor for whose Maintenance they all contribute in Proportion They have but one Boat belonging to the Island in which every Man has a Share proportionable to the Rent he pays The Men are generally strong are stout Rowers and will tug a long time at the Oar without Intermission They use no Compass but take their Measure from the Sun Moon or Stars and chiefly from the Courses of the Flocks of the Sea Fowl because they know very well to what Rocks or Islands they resort They are excellent at climbing of Rocks being accustomed to it from their Infancy in order to catch the Fowl which build on them They have two Ropes which belong to them in common for climbing the Rocks they are Fathoms in Length each and covered with Cows Hides salted to prevent their being cut by the Rocks The Men climb by turns and bring home some Thousands of Eggs and Fowls at a time They also make Gins of Horsehair for catching the Fowl yet sometimes they lose their Lives by climbing The richest Man in the Isle has not above eight Cows eighty Sheep and two or three Horses They have no Money but barter with one another for what they want  Mr  Martin  to whom I am obliged for most of these Particulars relating to the Islands for it cannot be supposed I could think of entering every one of them in Person gives an Account of that called the SECOND SIGHT which he says is a Representation  by way of Vision of something to come and makes such a strong Impression upon the Seers that they cannot see or think of any thing else while the Vision lasts and they appear chearful or otherwise according to the Nature of the Object represented they use no previous Means to attain it and to most of them 'tis very troublesome The Instances of the Truth of this  Second Sight  as 'tis called are so many and so frequent that it can scarcely be disputed 'Tis certainly a strange Illusion but I shall not venture to give my Opinion about it only observing with others that this Faculty decays in Proportion as Christianity increases among them and as they improve in Knowledge Some of the People to whom those Visions have been frequent have learned by Experience as we were told to determine the Time when the Things represented shall come to pass The Reverend Mr  John Frazer  the late Dean of the  Isles  has writ a small Treatise upon this Subject called    We shall conclude our Description of these Islands with an Extract from Mr  Toland  's Specimen of his  History of the Druids  where he treats in general of the Properties of all these Isles whither it seems he had intended to have travelled in order to perfect his History and rescue many valuable Pieces of Antiquity from utter Oblivion  'Tis certain says that Gentleman no Country abounds more with the Necessaries of Life and at less Labour or Charge than the  Hebrides  In the first place there is known to be in those Islands a prodigious Plenty of Flesh and Fish Their Cattle of all Sorts as Cows Sheep Goats and Hogs are exceeding numerous and prolifick small indeed of Size as are likewise their Horses but of a sweet and delicious Taste So are their Deer which freely range in Herds on the Mountains No Place can  compare with this for tame and wild Fowl there being of the latter nowhere in the World a greater Diversity many Sorts of them extremely beautiful and rare or utterly unknown elsewhere The like may be said of their various amphibious Animals Numberless are their Fountains and Springs Rivulets Rivers and Lakes very wholsome in their Waters and everywhere superabounding with Fish especially the most delicate as Trout and Salmon nor is it by Herrings alone that all  Europe  knows no Seas to be better stored nor with more Kinds from the Shrimp to the Whale as no Harbours or Bays are superior whether regard be had to Number or Commodiousness Add to this their Variety of excellent Roots and Plants particularly those of marine Growth every one of them serving for Food or Physick Their Pastures are so kindly that they might live on Milk alone with that inconceivable Quantity of Eggs they yearly gather off the desert Rocks and Islets Bread is plentiful enough The Ground is generally allow'd to be much richer than on the  Scotish  Continent some Parts whereof are not seldom supply'd hence with Corn  Lewes  is very fruitful and tho' Barley Oats and Rye be the only Grain sown there at present yet the Ground both in that and most of the other Islands is fit to bear Wheat and consequently Legumes of all sorts 'Tis truly amazing they have any Crop at all considering how unskilful they are in Agriculture how destitute of the properest Instruments to till the Ground and that they scarce use any other Manure but Seawreck or Tangles From the Ignorance of the Inhabitants in these respects as also in planting inclosing and draining many fruitful Spots lie uncultivated but they are abundantly supply'd with choice Eatables and the most nourishing Shellfish  In  Bernera  near  Harries  the Produce of Barley is many times from to fold In  Harries  and  Southvist  one Barleygrain sometimes produces from to Ears as in  Northvist  from to fold in a plentiful Year At  Corchattan  in  Skye  the Increase amounted once to If the Ground be laid down for some time it gives a good Crop without Dunging some Fields not having been dung'd in Years A small Tract of Ground at  Skerrybreek  in the said Isle of  Skye  had yielded fold With regard to their Pastures nothing is more common than for an Ewe to have two Lambs at a time Besides the ordinary Rent a Tenant paid it was a Custom in the Islands if any of his Cows or Sheep brought two young ones at a time one of them was to go to the Landlord who on his part was obliged if any of his Tenants Wives bore Twins to take one of them into his own Family Even the wild Goats on the Mountains for such there are in  Harries  are observed to bring forth their Young twice a Year From hence 'tis evident that those Islands are capable of great Improvement as they abound likewise in many Curiosities especially in Subjects of Philosophical Observation Nor is it less plain by the many antient Monuments remaining among them and the Marks of the Plough reaching to the very Tops of the Mountains which the artless Inhabitants think incapable of Culture that in remote Ages they were in a far more flourishing Condition than at present The Ruins of spacious Houses and the numerous Obelisks old Forts Temples Altars  c  undeniably prove this besides that the Country was formerly full of Woods as appears by the great Oak and Firrtrees daily dug out of the Ground and by many other Tokens there being several Woods and Coppices still remaining in  Skye Mull  and other Places The Inhabitants are not to be mended in the Proportion  of their Persons no preposterous Bandages distorting them in the Cradle nor hindering Nature from duly forming their Limbs which is the Reason that bodily Imperfections of any sort are very rare among them Neither does any overofficiously preventive Physick in their Infancy spoil their original Constitution whence they have so strong a Habit of Body that one of them requires treble the Dose as will purge any Man in the South of  Scotland  But what contributes above all things to their Health and Longevity is constant Temperance and Exercise Their Food is commonly fresh and their Meals two a Day Water being the ordinary Drink of the Vulgar They cure all Disorders of the Body by Simples of their own Growth and by proper Diet or Labour Hence they are stout and active dextrous in all their Exercises as they are withal remarkably sagacious cholerick but easily appeased sociable goodnatured everchearful and having a strong Inclination to Musick They are hospitable beyond Expression entertaining all Strangers of what Condition soever  gratis  the Use of Money being still in some of those Islands unknown and till a few Ages past in all of them They have no Lawyers or Attorneys The Men and Women plead their own Causes and a very speedy Decision is made by the Proprietor who is perpetual President in their Courts or by his Bailiff as his Substitute  The present says Mr  Toland  is the th Lord of  Barra  by uninterrupted lineal Descent a thing whereof no Prince in the World can boast and he is regarded as no mean Potentate by his Subjects who know none greater than he When the Wife of any of them dies he has immediate recourse to his Lord representing first his own Loss in the Want of a Female Companion and next that of  Macneil  his Lord himself if he should not go on to beget  Followers for him Hereupon  Macneil  finds out a suitable Match neither Side ever disliking his Choice but accepting it as the highest Favour and the Marriage is celebrated without any Courtship Portion or Dowry but they never fail to make merry on such Occasions with a Bottle or more of Usquebaugh On the other hand when any Woman becomes a Widow she is upon the like Application soon provided with an Husband and with as little Ceremony  Macneil  also supplies any of his Tenants with as many Milchcows as he may chance to lose by the Severity of the Weather or by other Misfortunes He takes likewise into his own Family and maintains to the Day of their Death as many old Men as thro' Age or Infirmity become unfit for Labour an House being built hardby on Purpose for them  Of the Northern Isles of  Scotland    WE come now to the Isles of  Orkney  and  Shetland  The  Orkneys  called by the  Latins Orcades  have the  Caledonian  Ocean on the West the  German  Ocean on the East the Sea that divides them from  Shetland  on the North and  Pentland  Firth Miles long and Miles broad which divides them from the main Land of  Scotland  on the South Antient Authors differ about their Number  Pliny  reckoned them Forty  Orosius  Thirtythree but it appears by later Discoveries that they are only Twentyeight They lie in Longitude Deg Min Latitude Deg Min The longest Day is Hours and some odd Minutes The Winters as in most small Islands and indeed always near the Sea are generally more subject to Rain than Snow The Frost and Snow do not continue long but the Wind is very boisterous and it rains  sometimes not by Drops but by violent Spouts of Water  STROMA lies so near the Coast of  Caithness  that it was always possessed by the Earls of that County and therefore not reckoned among the  Orcades  This is a small Island but not unfruitful Authors are not agreed as to the Reason of giving the Name of  Pentland Firth  to that Streight in Breadth about Miles which lies between the  Orcades  and the main Land some say it is a Corruption of the Word  Pictland Firth  which was so called because the  Picts  formerly inhabited those Islands and part of the neighbouring Continent and that many of them perished here when repulsed by the antient Inhabitants of  Orkney  Others think  Pentland Firth  the proper Name and it was so denominated from the Highlands or Hills in the North of  Scotland  by which it is bounded on one Side for the same Reason that the high Hills which take their Rise some Miles Southwest of  Edinburgh  are called  Pentland Hills  This Firth is remarkable for its swift violent and contrary Tides occasioned by the Multitude of the Isles and the Narrowness of the Passage which makes it very dangerous especially to Strangers and which is remarkable the Whirlpools with which this Firth abounds occasioned as is thought by some  Hiatus's  in the Earth below are most dangerous in a Calm and whirl the Boats or Ships round till they swallow them up but if there be any Wind and the Boat under Sail they are passed without Danger The Mariners who use to carry Passengers between the main Land and the Isles if at any time they are driven near those Whirlpools by the Tide throw a Barrel Oar Bundle of Straw or any other bulky Thing that comes to hand into the Whirlpools which make them smooth enough till the Vessel pass over them and what is thus cast in is generally found floating again a Mile or two  distant The different Tides in this Firth are reckoned twentyfour and run with such impetuous Force that no Ship under Sail with the fairest Wind is able to make way against them yet the Natives on both Sides who know the proper Seasons pass this Firth every Day safely except when the Weather is tempestuous  The first of the  Orkney  Islands is SOUTH RONALSA six Miles long and five broad fruitful in Corn and well inhabited it has a safe Harbour on the Northside but the Southeast has the dangerous Rocks called  Pentland Skerries  it abounds with Cattle and has two united Parish Churches whereof the Dean was Minister  A little to the Southwest lies SWINNA a small Island fruitful in Corn capable of maintaining a few Husbandmen and their Families has a good Fishing on its Coasts and is noted for a good Slate Quarry The Whirlpools near this Island are called the  Wells of Swinna    Beyond  Swinna  lie WAYES and HOY which are but one Isle Miles long and full of high Mountains that Part called  Wayes  is fruitful and very well inhabited This Island has several good Harbours particularly that called  North Hope  one of the best in the World and properest for those who design a Fishingtrade That Part called  Hoy  from which it is only separated by a Springtide has the highest Mountains in  Orkney  and the deepest Valleys which strike a Terror into Strangers who have Occasion to travel that Way On these Mountains there are many Sheep which run wild and are scarcely to be caught by any Art On  Rorahead  a high and rugged Promontory in this Island an extraordinary Fowl which the Inhabitants call  Lyer  builds its Nest it is about the Size of a Duck and so fat that it seems to be nothing else the Inhabitants admire it much and venture their Lives  to climb for it by Ropes  c  It is reckoned delicious Food eaten with Vinegar and Pepper On a barren Heath in this Island lies an oblong Stone in a Valley between two moderate Hills called by way of Contraries  The dwarfy Stone  It is Feet long Feet broad and Feet high No other Stones are near it 'Tis all hollow'd within having a Door on the Eastside two Feet square with a Stone of the same Dimension lying about two Feet from it which was intended no doubt to close this Entrance Within there is cut out at the Southend of it the Form of a Bed and Pillow capable of holding two Persons as at the Northend is another Bed both very neatly done Above at an equal Distance from both is a large round Hole which is supposed not only to have been designed for letting in Light and Air when the Door was shut but likewise for letting out Smoke from the Fire for which there is a Place made in the Middle between the two Beds The Marks of the Workman's Tool appear everywhere and the Tradition of the Vulgar is that a Giant and his Wife had this Stone for their Habitation tho' the Door alone destroys this Fancy which is wholly groundless every way besides Just by it is a clear and pleasant Spring for the Use of the Inhabitant  From the Top of these Hills the Sun is to be seen all Night about the Summer Solstice On the North Part of this Island are a Church a Gentleman's Seat and several Farmhouses as also divers Lakes which abound with Fish especially Trouts  Three Miles from  South Ronalsay  lies BURRA three Miles long and one broad fruitful in Corn and Pasturage and affords excellent Fewel  Stewart  of  Mains  built a noble and sumptuous Stone House here This Isle abounds with Rabbets and has a Chapel but belongs to the Parish of  South Ronalsay    West from this lies FLOTTA Miles long and and a half broad most of it encompassed with high Rocks it has a Church and a Gentleman's Seat and abounds with excellent Landfowl in its Heaths but has little Cornground and not many Inhabitants  Near this lie FAIRA CAVA and GRANSEY fruitful and pleasant tho' small Islands  We pass by several  Holms  as they call them which are left for Pasturage and come to POMONA the largest of the  Orkney  Islands and for that Reason called  The Mainland  it is Miles long in some Places nine and in others six Miles broad it is very fruitful and well inhabited tho' there are no Trees in all these Islands but what grow in the Bishop's Gardens at  Kirkwall  in this Island the only Town in  Orkney  a Royal Borough long possessed by the  Norwegians  pleasantly situated upon a Bay near the Middle of it it is about a Mile in Length and is the Seat of Justice where the Sheriffs  c  keep their Courts It consists of one Street which is narrow but the Houses are well built and most of them covered with Slate The Crown had formerly a very strong Castle here which is now in Ruins Near the Castle stands a stately House formerly the Bishop's Seat and near to that a Palace which was begun by  Patrick Stewart  Earl of  Orkney  in the Year but not finished because of his untimely Death Several Rooms of it have been curiously painted with Scripture Stories At the Northend of the Town is a Fort built by the  English  during  Oliver Cromwell  's Administration ditch'd about with a Breastwerk and other Fortifications on which they have some Canon planted for the Defence of the Harbour There is a stately Cathedral Church here called by the Name of  St Magnus  who the Natives say was their first Apostle it is very magnificent for this Part of the World and built of hewn Stone excellently  polished it has fourteen Pillars on each Side and a Steeple erected on four larger Pillars in the Middle with fine Bells in it there are so many Turnings that it is hard for a Stranger to find the same Way out or in Here is a publick Grammarschool they have a Charter for two weekly Markets and an annual Fair which holds three Days The Town is governed by a Provost four Bailiffs and a Commoncouncil This Island has nine Parishchurches many Promontories and Bays and several Mines of good white and black Lead it has also several Gentlemens Seats and divers Lakes and Rivulets which abound with Salmon and other Fish It has four very good Harbours  viz  one at  Kirkwall  both large and safe another at  Deersound  very large with good Anchorage and capable of receiving the greatest Fleets the third is at  Graham  's  Hall  and the fourth at  Kerston  which is very commodious and well fenced against all Winds In this Island are two Temples where the Natives believe by Tradition that the Sun and Moon were worshipped which Belief of theirs is very right since the lesser Temple is semicircular The greater is Paces diameter There are two green Mounts erected at the East and Westend of it and round each of the Temples a Trench or Ditch is drawn like that about  Stonekenge  Many of the Stones are about or Feet in Height above the Ground about five in Breadth and a Foot or two in Thickness Some of them are fallen down and the Temples are one on the East and the other on the Westside of the Lake of  Stennis  where it is shallow and fordable there being a Passage over by large stepping Stones Near the smaller Temple which is on the Eastside of the Lake as the greater on the West stand two Stones of the same Bigness with the rest thro' the Middle of one of which runs a large Hole by which Criminals and Victims were tyed  East from  The Mainland  lies COPPINSHA a small Island but fruitful in Corn and Grass has good Fishing and abounds with Fowl it is very conspicuous to Seamen as is the Holm to the Northeast of it called  The Horse of Coppinsha    North from  The Mainland  lies SHAPINSHA five or six Miles long and three broad it has a very safe Harbour and a Parishchurch  To the Southeast lies STRONSA six Miles long and three broad well known because of its good Harbours to those who frequent this Country and  Shetland  for Fishing it is very fruitful and well inhabited and has a Rock belonging to it called  Outkerrie  remarkable for its good Fishery  A little North of it lies a little pleasant Isle called PAPA STRONSA very fruitful and well inhabited  Farther North lies SANDA about Miles long and eight Miles broad well inhabited and has two Harbours it abounds with Cattle Hay and Fish but the Inhabitants are obliged to bring their Fewel from EDA which lies East of it It is ten Miles long and in some Places five Miles broad there is good Salt made here and it abounds with Fish and Fowl but not with Corn and Grass  Three Miles West from  Kirkwall  lies DAMSEY a small but fruitful Island and abounds with Fish  To the Northwest lies ROUSA eight Miles long and six broad it has many Promontories and high Hills but on the Coast is fruitful and well inhabited it abounds also with Fowl Fish and Rabbets  There are several other Islands in the Neighbourhood which are fruitful enough for their Extent  Eight Miles North from  Kirkwall  lies EGLISHA three Miles long and two broad it has a safe Road for Ships is very pleasant and fruitful and has a Parishchurch  Five Miles Northeast lies NORTHFARA three Miles long it is but thinly inhabited but affords the common Commodities of the Country  SOUTHFARA which lies near  Burra  is much of the same Extent and Nature  North from  Eglisha  lies WESTRA eight Miles long in some Places five and in others three Miles broad it is well inhabited abounds with Corn Cattle Fish and Rabbets has a strong Castle with a convenient Harbour  Two Miles Northeast lies PAPAWESTRA three Miles long a Mile and a half broad is well inhabited has a good Harbour and together with the other  Westra  makes up a Parish In this Island stand near a Lake now called  St Tredwell's Loch  two Obelisks in one of which is a Hole used by the Heathens for the Tying of Criminals and Victims and behind them lying on the Ground a third Stone hollowed like a Trough  The People of the  Orcades  are generally healthful stout and well proportioned they are more numerous than can reasonably be imagined  Bleau  in his  Atlas  says they mustered Men at once near  Kirkwall  fit to carry Arms besides those that were left to cultivate the Ground The Commodities which they export yearly are Butter Tallow Hides Barley Malt Oatmeal Fish salted Beef Pork Rabbetskins Otterskins white Salt Stuffs Stockens Wool Hams Quills Down Feathers  c Molucca  Beans figured Stones and peculiar Sorts of Fish and Fowls are found here The  Claik  Geese or  Barnacles  which are reckoned to breed in the Trunks of Trees or in the Timber of old Ships and have been so frequently seen about these and the neighbouring Islands have occasioned abundance of Wrangling among the Learned Some of them have denied the Matter of Fact and boldly asserted there could be no such thing in Nature as  that Birds should proceed from Trees others who could not resist the Evidence of so many Persons of Credit who had seen and attested the hanging of Birds of that sort to the Trunks of Trees  c  have had recourse to such strange Philosophical Notions for explaining this Phaenomenon as still made the thing more ridiculous and incredible But there are two ways to solve this Difficulty found out by modern Authors both of which seem very probable The first is the  Concha Anatifera  mentioned by Sir  Robert Sibbald  in his  Natural History of  Scotland  Book  III  Part  ii  Cap  wherein he says that those Shells stick to Seaware or Logs of Fir and suck Nourishment from them that the Animal contained in those Shells is a Fish but unshapely and sends out such a Multitude of Feet as resemble Hair which the unwary Observer takes for Feathers and of this Animal Sir  Robert  has given us a Cut in the End of his Book Dr  Wallis  in his Description of  Orkney  has done the like and tells us he has seen some Thousands of those  Conchae  sticking to Logs of Wood driven ashore in that Country But the Solution given by a late Author in his  Curiosities of Nature and Art in Husbandry and Gardening  lately printed at  London  p seems still to be more plain if the Fact be true  viz  That the  Barnacles  lay their Eggs as Fish do theirs and leave them at the Mercy of the Waves and that as they float they stick to what they meet especially rotten Wood Seaware and other maritime Plants upon which we may observe a glutinous Substance and that they are hatched there by the Heat of the Sun  The People of the  Orcades  generally speaking are very civil and industrious hospitable sober and religiously disposed Tho' the Air be sharp and cold yet it may be called temperate They are generally longlived the Women handsome bearing Children  sometimes at sixty Years They are seldom afflicted with Fevers Stone or Gout but are often liable to the Scurvy Agues and Consumptions They generally speak the  English  Tongue after the  Scots  way but many antient People of the poorer Sort speak the  Norn  or  Norway  or old  Danish  Tongue which has been continued from the first Planters of these Islands They have plenty of Black Cattle Sheep Swine Rabbets Geese and several sorts of Fish They export great Quantities of Oil Butter and salt Flesh which turn to good Account Their Cornland is everywhere inclosed and without these Inclosures their Sheep and Swine and most of their Cattle go loose without an Herdsman  They formerly had their own Kings after the Manner of the  Picts  who were harassed by the  Romans  but by the Injury of Time or Negligence of Writers only two are come to the Knowledge of Posterity  viz Bladus  or  Balus  and  Ganus  who was cotemporary with  Caractacus  the th King of  Scotland  in the first Century  These Isles 'tis likely were under their own Princes of the  Pictish  Blood till they were subdued by King  Kenneth Macalpin  about the Year But  Anno    Donald Bane  having assigned them to the King of  Norway  for assisting him in his Usurpation the  Norwegians  invaded them and were Masters for about Years when  Magnus  King of  Norway  sold all again to  Alexander  King of  Scotland  who gave the Property hereof to a Nobleman surnamed  Speire  an Heiress of whose Family brought it to the  Sinclairs  or  St Clares  one of whom carried the Title of Prince of  Orkney  Duke of  Old  nburgh c  and married a Daughter of the King of  Denmark  's But one of his Successors having forfeited the Title and Estate fell to the Crown tho' in Truth the  Scots  reap'd but little Profit by them being often disturbed by the Kings  of  Denmark  and  Norway  who claimed the Sovereignty and in some measure continued possessed of it till the Marriage of King  James  III with a Daughter of  Denmark  when they were first mortgaged for a great Sum due then by the Contract and thereafter upon her bringing forth a Son afterwards King  James  IV the intire Right to them was surrendered to King  James  III which was farther confirmed to King  James  VI upon his marrying  Anne  his Queen the King of  Denmark  's Daughter The Earldom of  Orkney  and Lordship of  Zetland  continued in the Crown till Queen  Mary  being to marry  James Hepburn  Earl of  Bothwell  by fatal Advice of her Privy Council advanced him to the Dignity of Duke of  Orkney  After his Death King  James  VI created a natural Son of King  James  V Earl which failing in his Son it returned to the Crown and  Anno    William Dowglass  Earl of  Morton  having advanced as he said great Sums to King  Charles  I procured this Country in Mortgage for his Money but it was redeemed and by Act of Parliament all reannexed to the Crown  Anno  excepting what belonged to the Bishop which Act suppressed the Office of  Sheriff  and erected one with a different Name  viz  to be called  The Stewartry of  Orkney  and  Zetland But the said Country by the UnionParliament was dissolved from the Crown and her late Majesty thereupon granted the same to the then Earl of  Morton  for Payment of the yearly Sum of  l  and appointed him Steward and Justicier within the Bounds thereof Under the Stewards are some Judges of his Creation and Appointment called  Bailiffs  In every Parish and Isle there is one Their Office is to oversee the Manners of the Inhabitants to hold Courts and to determine in Civil Matters to the Value of  l Scots    s    d English  but if the Matter be above it is referred to the Steward  or his Deputy Under and subservient to those Bailiffs are six or seven of the most honest and intelligent Persons within the Parish called  Lawrightmen  These in their respective Bounds have the Oversight of the People in manner of Constables and inform the Bailiff of such Enormities as occasionally happen which the latter punishes according to the Importance and Circumstances of the Fault and if it be above his Limits or the Extent of his Power he sends the Delinquent to the Seat of  Justice  which is held as we hinted at  Kirkwall  by the Steward or his Deputy These  Lawrightmen  have a Privilege inherent to their Office by the Custom of the Country which is not usual elsewhere and this is if there be any Suspicion of Theft they take some of their Neighbours with them during the Silence of the Night and make Search for the Theft which is called  Ransacking  from  Ransaka  which is to make Inquiry in the antient  Danish  they search every House they come to and seizing him upon whom the Theft is found bring him to the Seat of  Justice    The Christian Religion was not only preached but planted very early in these Isles for we find  Servanus  or St  Serf  was their Bishop and Preceptor to the famous  Kentigern  whom in a familiar way he called  Mongah  or  Mungo  in his vulgar Tongue who founded the Bishoprick of  St Asaph  in  Wales  about the Year and who had been also Bishop of  Glasgow  And  Anno  the People of  Orkney  sent one of their Clergy to  York  with Letters desiring that Archbishop who was then in  Fact  possessed of a Jurisdiction over the Church of  Scotland  to consecrate him to be their Bishop The last  Popish  Bishop was  Adam Hepburn  who conformed to the Reformation and lived many Years after it He was an eminent Man in his Time a Lord of Council and Session he crowned King  James  VI was Father to the Lord  Holyroodhouse  where he was Abbot and where his Tomb remains to this Day The brave Lieutenant General  George Hamilton  Field Marshal of  Great Britain  lately deceased was Earl of  Orkney    Eighty Miles farther North lie the Isles of SHETLAND betwixt them lies the FAIR ISLE which rises up in three high Promontories and is seen both in  Orkney  and  Shetland  They lie in and Degrees of North Latitude and have  Norway  on the East which is the nearest Part of the Continent of  Europe  There are in all Fortysix Islands Forty Holms or lesser Isles left for Pasturage and Thirty Rocks frequented only by Fowl  The first of these Islands called THE MAINLAND is Miles long and in some Places broad it runs into the Sea with abundance of Promontories it is best inhabited and cultivated on the Shore but the inner Part is mountainous and full of Lakes or Bogs which makes travelling there to Strangers dangerous The Air is cool and piercing yet many of the Inhabitants live to a great Age About the Summer Solstice they have so much Light all Night that they can see to read by it The Sun sets between Ten and Eleven at Night and rises between One and Two in the Morning and on the other hand the Day is so much shorter and the Night longer in the Winter which with the Violence of the Tides and the Tempestuousness of the Seas deprives them of all foreign Correspondence from  October  to  April  during which Time they know nothing of what passes in the other Parts of the World A known Instance of this was that tho' the Revolution happened to begin in  November  they knew nothing of it till the  May  following when a Fisherman who arrived there told them of it and then they imprisoned him in order to try him for spreading such News  They are much subject to the Scurvy by eating too much Fish but Nature has furnished them with great Quantities of Scurvygrass for an Antidote They have little Corn of their own Growth and therefore import great Quantities from  Orkney  Their common Drink is Whey which they barrel up and keep in cold Cellars this makes it very strong so that it quickly turns their Heads Some of them keep for their Drink Buttermilk mixed with Water and this they call  Bland  The better Sort have good Beer and Ale of which they are very liberal to Strangers They have abundance of the Fish of all Sorts on their Coasts for most Part of the Year those that abound most are Cod Ling and Herring They have also Shellfish of all Sorts with Whales Seals Seacalves and Otters and in the Wintertime they burn Oil of Fish instead of Candle They abound with all Sorts of Fowl except Heathcocks and other Fowls which frequent Heaths will not live there when brought thither tho' they have abundance of Heath They have Store of Geese and many Sorts of Ducks They have Plenty of little Horses which they call  Schelties  very fit for the Husbandman's Use and pace naturally They make coarse Cloth Stockens and knit Gloves for their own Use and also for Sale to the  Norwegians  Their Grain is Oats and Big but most of the latter They have abundance of Black Cattle and Sheep Their Ewes are very prolifick and for the most part bring forth two and sometimes three Lambs at once Their Fewel is Turf Peat and Heath Their chief Trade of Export consists in Fish by the Produce of which they pay their Rent and purchase Necessaries Their native Language is old  Gothick  or  German  as was also that of  Orkney  but they generally now speak  English  In their Customs and Habit they much resemble the  Germans  but the better Sort  imitate the  Scots Lowlanders  Their Religion is Protestant and they are generally as well as the  Orkneymen  very devout There were few or no Presbyterians in these Parts before the Year when new Missionaries came and ejected the old Clergy yet the People did not care to hear them so long as they had any body else They make use of no Physicians and if at any time they receive Wounds they cure themselves There are two little Towns in this Island the first and oldest is  Scalloway  on the Westside of the Island where there is a Castle four Stories high the Inhabitants are about an hundred in Number The second and largest is  Lerwick  which by their Fishingtrade is increased now to about three hundred Families  There are several antient Monuments in these Islands and particularly those called  Picts Houses  which we have not room to insist upon  The  Dutch Hamburghers  c come hither to fish in  June  and go away again in  August  and  September  and sometimes there are two thousand Busses fishing in  Brassa  's Sound at once  The most remarkable of the other Islands here are ZEAL commonly called YELL eighteen Miles long and nine broad it has three Churches and several Chapels And  Farther North lies VUIST much of the same Dimensions plain pleasant to the Eye fruitful and well inhabited It is the pleasantest of the  Shetland  Isles has three Churches and as many Harbours The Inhabitants say no Cats will live in it  TRONDA lies overagainst  Scalloway  it is three Miles long and two broad  A little Northeast lies WALSEY three Miles long and as many broad  On the East of  Brassa  's Sound lies GREAT RULE eight Miles long and two broad it has a good Harbour  Six Leagues West from  The Mainland  lies FOULA three Miles in Length  More to the East lies BRASA five Miles long and two broad it has some arable Ground and two Churches  BURRAY is three Miles long has good Pasturage abounds with Fish on the Coast and has a Church in it No Mice will live here and 'tis said they forsake the Place whereever the Earth of it is brought  Shetland  is divided into twelve Parishes but there are many more Churches and Chapels in it This Country like  Orkney  has no Wood in it but they have some Fish and Fowl peculiar to themselves The Inhabitants are very bold in venturing to Sea at all Seasons for Fish and in climbing the Rocks for Fowl  It has been debated among the Learned whether these Islands the  Orcades  or the Northeast Coast of  Scotland  was the THULE of the Antients but we have not room to give an Account of the Arguments for the several Hypotheses nor to consider which of them are most conclusive tho' it ought to be observed that Sir  Robert Sibbald  has in a manner demonstrated that the Northeastern Parts of  Scotland  were what the Antients called so For thus speaks  Claudian  of  Theodosius  Father of the Emperor of that Name  Ille Caledoniis posuit qui castra pruinis  Maduerunt Saxone fuso  Orcades incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule  Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Ierne  In  Caledonian  Frosts encamp'd he stood  When  Orkney  Isles were dy'd with  Saxon  Blood  Then THULE with the  Pictish  Gore grew hot  Icy  Strathern  bemoan'd each slaughter'd  Scot  Silius Italicus  takes notice in  Thule  of a Custom well known among the antient  Britons  and  Caledonians  Coerulus haud aliter cum dimicat incola Thules  Agmina falcifero circumvenit acta covino  So when the azure Son of  Thule  wars  He circles Armies driv'n in pointed Cars  The chief Families in  Orkney  and  Shetland  are the  Bruces Sinclairs Mouats Nivets Chyneys Stuarts Grahams Moodies Dowglasses Honeymans Trails Bakies Southerlands Craigies Youngs Buchanans c  But the most antient and I may say original are the  Fletts Hackrews Richens Feas Skolas Grottes  c  In the Mouth of the River FORTH lie several Islands the most considerable of which is the MAY it was formerly dedicated to St  Adrian  who was martyred there by the  Danes  and afterwards a religious Place was built in Memory of him The Monks gave out that barren Women who came thither annually to worship at St  Adrian  's Shrine would thereby be cured of their Barrenness and it was frequented upon that Account by Women in the Popish Times But whether St  Adrian  or the Monks had the most Influence in curing their Barrenness I determine not Yet that fond silly Persuasion obtained so much Credit that  Wood  of  Largo  who was a noted Sea Captain had a Charter of several Lands from King  James  IV to be in Readiness upon Call to attend his Majesty and the Queen while they visited St  Adrian  This Island is a Mile long from North to South and about a Quarter of a Mile broad it lies seven Miles from  the Coast of  Fife  has a freshwater Spring and a small Lake There grows no Corn here but in the Summer it affords Pasturage for an hundred Sheep and twenty Black Cattle The Westside is inaccessible because of high Rocks but the Eastside is plain and has four Places where Boats may arrive one of them a safe Harbour for Ships during a strong West Wind Fish of all Sorts are numerous on the Coast of this Island and it abounds with Fowl particularly those called Skarts Dunters Gulls Scouts and Kittawaax the latter is about the Size of a Dove and in  July  is prefer'd to a Partridge The Scouts are somewhat less than a Duck but their Eggs are larger than those of a Goose and being boiled hard eat very well with Vinegar and Parsley This Island of  May  formerly belonged to the Priory of  Pittenweem  but was granted in Fee by King  Charles  I to  Cunningham  of  Barns  with Liberty to build a Lighthouse there for the Benefit of Ships for the Maintenance of which they were to allow  d per  Tun A Tower of Foot high is built there for that End with a Fire every Night and the first Builder was cast away in returning from thence to his House in  Fife  by a Tempest which some poor old Women were executed for raising  The BASS lies next but I have given an Account of it already  Higher up in the  Forth  lies INCHKEITH betwixt  Fife  and  Lothian  a Mile and a half long and about half a Mile broad the Soil is fat and produces good Grass and abundance of physical Herbs It has four freshwater Springs and as many Harbours one towards each Quarter it rises in the Middle and has a strong Stone Fort raised upon it by Queen  Mary  There is a Stone Quarry here which sends forth a strong sulphurous Smell when any Pieces are broken off but very fit for Building There are  great Shoals of Fish round the Coasts of this Island and abundance of Oysters during the Winter This Island had its Name from the noble Family of  Keith  whose Founder had this Island with the Barony of  Ceithmareschal  in  Lothian  and the Hereditary Dignity of Earl Mareschal of  Scotland  conferr'd upon him by King  Malcolm  II in the Year for his Valour in the Battle against the  Danes  at  Bar  in  Angus  It came afterwards to the Crown and was given by King  Robert  II to  John  Lord  Lyon  of  Glames  the Chief of that Family with the Barony of  Kinghorn  upon his marrying that Prince's Daughter It is since in other Hands It is observed that Horses grow fat here in a little time  Higher up within two Miles of  Aberdour  lies an Island called ST COLM'S INCH as being dedicated to St  Columba  it had formerly a famous Abbey with large Endowments but it is now ruined and upon the Alienation of Abbey Lands was given to the Lord  Downs  a Branch of the Family of  Stuart    Higher up lies INCHGARVY between two Promontories near the  Queen's Ferry  it was also fortified and the Guns of the Forts could reach the Shore or both Sides so that no Ships could safely pass it without Leave  On the Top of an high rocky Hill at the Westend of the Islands of  Orkney  near the Village of  Skeal  there is a sort of Pavement consisting of Stones variously figured some like an Heart others like a Crown a Leg a Weaver's Shuttle  c  It takes up above a Quarter of a Mile in Length and from to Feet in Breadth In removing any of these Stones the Figure is as neat on the Underside as the Upper and being as big as the Life all of one Colour or a reddish Kind of Stone pitched in a reddish Earth and the Pavemen so very long it cannot be any of the tessellated or chequer'd  Works of the  Romans  Part of a Garden Wall is decorated with these Stones and many of them are taken away by the neighbouring Gentry to set them up like  Dutch  Tiles in their Chimneys so that at this rate in less than a Century this Pavement will in all likelihood subsist only in Books  It has been long observed that the Islands of  Scotland  especially the Western lie more conveniently for carrying on and bringing the Fishingtrade to Perfection than any other Parts of  Europe    King  Charles  I began the Experiment in Conjunction with a Company of Merchants but that Design miscarried by the Civil War which unhappily broke out at that Time The next Attempt was made by King  Charles  II who also joined with some Merchants and this succeeded well for a Time Mr  Martin  assures us from such as saw the Fish that were caught by that Company that they were reputed the best in  Europe  of their Kind and accordingly bore a greater Price But this Design was ruin'd thus The King having Occasion for Money was advised to withdraw that which was employ'd in the Fishery at which the Merchants being displeased and disagreeing likewise among themselves they also withdrew their Money and that Design has never been renewed since that Time  But the Revival of this Undertaking will in all Probability be one of the Blessings which this Island will reap by the late happy Union What can't  English  Money and  Scotish  Industry effect  The settling a Fishery in those Parts will raise a Nursery of stout and able Seamen in a very short time to serve the Government on all Occasions A new Colony need not be planted there for the Inhabitants of the  Western Isles  are reckoned to be about many of whom have no Employment and are generally dextrous at the Oar and  only want to be furnished with proper Materials for the Fishingtrade which would encourage the setting up other Manufactures The Commodiousness and Safety of the numerous Bays and Harbours in those Isles seem as if Nature had designed them for promoting Trade They have such abundance of Turf and Peat for Fewel as would furnish Saltpans with Fire all the Year round The Coast of each Island affords many thousand Loads of Seaware which if preserved might be successfully used for making Glass and likewise Kelp for Soap Several of the Islands afford great Quantities of fine Clay which if improved might turn to a good Account in making Earthenware of all Sorts Cod and Ling as well as lesser Fish are to be had on the Coasts of the lesser as well as the greater Islands and what has been said of the  Western Isles  may be said likewise of the Isles of  Orkney  and  Shetland    Having thus concluded our Tour thro' the whole Island we shall in order to render the same more complete subjoin the following Articles respecting as well the  Southern  as  Northern  Parts thereof and begin first with the
