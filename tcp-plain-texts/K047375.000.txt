BLUNDER  ACT I  SCENE I  A beautiful Country with a VineyardPeasants discovered  GLEE  HAPPY is the peasant's lot  If he know to prize it  Comfort lodges in a cot  Then let none despise it  Wholesome toil and fragrant air  Sauce our homely rustic fare  And you see  Poor peasantry  Are merry and full of enjoyment  While the great  In all their state  Are drooping for want of employment  Diego  Here comes Signor Lopez head man to the Chief Inquisitor of the province Don Miguel de Lara Stand back stand back and pay your humble obedience to him  They fall back and bow to  Lopez  as he enters  Lopez  Save you save you  They bow again  Ah that will do that is quite enough good people  It is really a tormenting thing to be a man of such consequence I don't wonder now that the Eastern monarchs suffer themselves to be seen so seldom for in good truth the homage that attends greatness is very troublesome to men of indolent habits  Diego  I am glad to see your Honour look so well today  Lopez  Thank youthank you  Diego  I hope that your Honour likes these parts and that you be not displeased with the folk hereabout  Lopez  Why as to these parts honest Diego they are pleasant enough Valencia is a pretty province but for the neighbourhood my good fellow that you must suppose is most diabolical to a man like me used not only to the society of Madrid but who have lived in London and Paris You may well conceive how wretched is my condition if you consider that with all my talents and information I am sometimes forced for want of better company to come and sit a whole hour with such a bumpkin as you It is hard is n't it  Diego  I am sorry we entertain you so badly but we do our best and always feel your company a vast honour  Lopez  That I consider and therefore put up with all deficiencies I am reasonable and know how to make allowances Pray have you seen the two strangers today that have been in the neighbourhood the last fortnight  Diego  No Signor Lopez  Lopez  Whimsical gentlemen They make freeseem to feel themselves quite at home  Diego  What countrymen are they  Lopez  What countrymen Oh Diego your  ignorance of men and mannersCan any country but one produce men mad enough to play such wild tricks in his Most Catholic Majesty's sober dominions and in full sight of the habitation of an Inquisitor No no Diego Englishmen are the only people who never consider change of place but are just the same harumscarum madcaps in all parts of the world as they are at home quite as ready to make an uproar in the court of the Great Mogul as to break a lamp within the liberties of Westminster  Diego  I did not understand that these strangers were both from the same country  Lopez  You did not understandMy dear Diego you should only listen and let other people understand for you Mark meYou are of the kingdom of Valencia I of Castilleyet we are both SpaniardsSo one of these strangers is of England the other of Ireland which though different islands yet the natives of both own one countryone kingand this in your ear Diego will with one heart defend their country and king against all the rest of the worldHere come two miserablelooking Hidalgosfellows that live in dirt and poverty from the fear of debasing their noble descent by honestly earning a whole coat and a good meal  Two Hidalgos enter with great stateliness and the appearance of extreme poverty  Lopez  Save you save you  They return no answer but look at him with great contempt and exeunt  These are precious vermin the most wretched paupers with the pride of princesHow soon must the nation go to ruin where it is reckoned dishonourable to be industrious They have a different method  of considering matters in the country I was just talking of Instead of seeing as we do here nobility made ridiculous by its entailing on future generations laziness and poverty in England you will find some of its most stately branches raised from the stock of honest industry  Diego  What is coming yonder  Lopez  HeyOh it is one of the strangers  Diego  He seems hurt or sickhis servants are wheeling him along in a chair  Lopez  That is only one of his mad whims He fancies himself in a consumption and went to Lisbon for the recovery of his healththere he fell in love and is now searching through Spain for his mistress whose relations suddenly conveyed her from Portugal Disappointment has increased his nervous fancies and with stamina to last a century he believes that he sha'n't exist a month This is the one from Irelandhe is called Sir Sturdy O'Tremor  Diego  Well Signor Lopez time pressesI must look to my work  Lopez  That is rightFarewell honest Diego  Exit  Diego  Sir Stur  Without  If you don't move me more gently I'll break every bone in your skins you vagabonds  Lopez  There is a voice for a man in a consumption  Sir  Sturdy  is wheeled on in an invalid chair by two Servants  Sir Stur  Gently gently you scoundrelsOh the Devil fetch you you have not a spark of compassion for your poor dying master There stop stop let me rest a morselOh it is all over with meEven this little bit of a motion is too great a fatigue for my wornout frame Come hither  PatNow Paton your conscience tell me don't I look like a corpse  Pat  By my faith your Honour it must be a corpse that died of a scarlet fever thenfor your gills look as rosy as Father O'Flanagan's when he has tossed off the fourth bottle  Sir Stur  Starting up in a rage and seizing him  You unfeeling brute to make a joke of your master's infirmitiesI'll shake you to atoms you dog  He shakes him and then sits down again  Pat  By Saint Patrick you have a pretty tight grip for a corpse  Walking away angrily  Lopez  If that be an Irishman in a consumption Heaven keep me from the clutches of one in full health and strength  Sir Stur  Seeing  Lopez  There is a stranger he can have no interest in deceiving meStep this way my good fellow I suppose you can read in my looks that I am not a man long for this world  Lopez  Aside  I have just gained a practical hint for my behaviour so I know how to humour youWhy Sir I am sorry to say I can't flatter you  Sir Stur  You are an honest fellow  Lopez  Not but I am perfectly aware that some persons might mistake that ruddy complexion  Sir Stur  Oh a mere flusha melancholy symptoma hectic glow  Lopez  Yes that is just what I supposed  Sir Stur  And as for my figure did you ever see such a poor miserable spectre  Lopez  Oh LordOh Lord  Aside  As you say Siryour figurebut you know Sir on that point I am unable to speak accurately not having seen you otherwise  Sir Stur  Why then it will surprise you to be told that I was oncea stout able▪bodied man  Lopez  I assure you Sir I am very much inclined to believe it  Sir Stur  Yes indeed and instead of this little bit of a pipe I once had a voice like thunder  Lopez  That I can readily imagine for to say the truth it still conveys no faint idea of that sound  Sir Stur  Oh yesI am all faint all feeble  Dash  Without  You lazy beggars I will put a little motion into you I'll make you active against your wills  He enters fighting with the two Hidalgos  Sir Stur  Starting up  Two to onefair play you spalpeins  He rushes on one of them trips him up and seizes his sword at the same time that  Dashington  disarms the other  Lopez  There is a poor feeble dying manIf I stay I shall certainly laugh in his face so I will take myself hence while I am safe  Exit  Dash  To the fallen Hidalgo  Away Sirfollow your companion and learn that to afford assistance to females in distress is an action that instead of being beneath a gentleman a prince may be proud of  Exit second Hidalgo  Sir Stur  What occasioned this encounter  Dash  You shall hear  Sir Stur  But first let me seat myself or I shall sink to the earth  Dash  Ha ha While a man can sink others to the earth with such ease he is not in much danger of sinking there himself  Sir Stur  Ah my dear Dashington you don't know my complaints  Dash  Very true and what is still better you don't know them yourselfBut to my story I saw at a distance moving along at the solemn  stately pace accordant with Spanish dignity an old lumbering vehicle that looked as if it had been a present from the city of London of one of their castoff lordmayor's coaches The coachman was very comfortably enjoying his  siesta  on the box Well on it paced for some time as orderly and slowly as if it had been in a procession when unluckily a bed of clover on the roadside tempting the steeds to deviate from the beaten track down went the carriage into an ugly kind of a hollow I heard the screams of women and flew to their assistance Those fellows were passing whose aid I required to raise the carriage The beggarly rascals considering such employment a degradation insolently refused I however effected my purpose without their help and fortune throwing them again in my way I was determined to pay them what I thought they deserved  Sir Stur  Oh the vagabonds I wish I had been with younot that in my feeble state I could have rendered any service  Dash  Yes I think you could  Sir Stur  No noit is all over with me  Dash  Really  Sir Stur  Yes quite  Dash  What a pity  Sir Stur  No power on earth could enable me to rise from this chair  Dash  Oh yes yes and I think you might even be brought to take a little walk with me only for a mile or so  Sir Stur  A mile or so Not there paces if it were to gain me the wealth of both Indies  Dash  Perhaps so I know you are not covetous but beauty angelic beauty might allure you  Sir Stur  Oh I am in a pretty state for beauty to have any effect on me  Dash  Then your case is hopeless indeed I am heartily sorry for it and I'll tell Jaquelina  Sir Stur  Eh what did you say of Jaquelina  Turning towards  Dashington  very actively  Dash  I said I should tell Jaquelina  Sir Stur  Ah you mean if you should happen to see that dear creature after I am dead  Dash  If I don't see her till after you are dead your consumption must be a galloping one  Sir Stur  Hey  Dash  I only mean that you must die in a devil of a hurry for I am to see Jaquelina in a few hours  Sir Stur  What see Jaquelina in a few hours  Starting up  Dash  Bless my soul you are on your legs again But be composedsit down my dear fellow you'll do yourself harmGood byeI'll tell you all another time  Sir Stur  What do you mean by another time  Walking after him impatiently  Dash  My dear friend you'll fatigue yourself to death You know you could not walk three paces for the wealth of both Indies  Sir Stur  I'd walk  to  both Indies to see Jaquelina Where is she my dear friend  Dash  Herehere in this very place  Sir Stur  Tol lol  Singing and dancing in great ecstasy  Dash  Don't agitate your feeble frame  Sir Stur  Feeble I am as stout as a lion  Dash  I knew I should work a miracle Now learn that Jaquelina who was so suddenly removed from your sight at Lisbon was in the very  carriage which overturned this morning I had her in my arms  Sir Stur  And let me take you in my arms my dear friend for you have raised me from the grave  Dash  But calm your ecstasy she is confined by bolts and bars  Sir Stur  Where  Dash  In a conventand what is worse she fears that she is soon to take the veil  Sir Stur  I'll set fire first to every convent in Spain in defiance of the Inquisition  Dash  I think you may obtain her by less violent means  Sir Stur  How how my dear friend  Dash  That you shall know with all expedition The ladies who were in the carriage with her were so terrified at the accident that they were a long time before they recovered their senses so while they obligingly continued fainting we had opportunity to lay plans for her escape  Sir Stur  But when  Dash  This very night  Sir Stur  Delightful  Dash  And I am to be a reverend friar for the occasion Come along and you shall know all but Sir Sturdy you forget your invalid chairYou won't be so rash as to walk  Sir Stur  Walk Why I could fly if that were the only way to get a sight of her  Allons mon cher  mi  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Wood with a Cottage  LOPEZ  enters  Surely my master Don Miguel de Lara is the last man in the world that I should have suspected of accepting a post in the Holy Office He used to be the most friendly goodhumoured old fellow in all Spain what then could induce him to become an Inquisitor He is mightily altered and yet somehow the change is only superficial He frowns at every body and hardly speaks a kind word but I have reason to think his heart is as humane as ever He has sent me to seek out a melancholy being who as he understands chooses to live in this lonely place A man can't be void of tenderness who courts the society of the unfortunateThis must be the person I am sent toI'll observe him a little before I accost him  Enter  ALPHONSO  from the Cottage  Alph  Now to my painful task of seeking commerce with that hated being man to purchase means of eking out a life of wretchedness Were I not forced by nature's wants to the detested intercourse I might be sheltered in this friendly solitude from the sight my eyes abhor and my heart sickens ata human face  Lopez  comes forward  Ha What hunted to my very den No beast of prey is chased by man with such unwearied ardour as he pursues his fellow  Lopez  My master sent me Sir Good Heavens I surely know that face My Lord Alphonso  Alph  What my hated name Have I then fled to this secluded spot seeking to shun the sight of man but most of all to hide me from their view who knew me in my days of happiness and must I still meet eyes that in this wretched being trace AlphonsoBut to your errand your master sent you who is he  Lopez  Chief of the Inquisition of Valencia  Alph  What is that tribunal grown impolitic in cruelty to seek a wretch like me to wreak its vengeance on Those who delight in human misery should single out the happy and force the groan of anguish from the heart that ne'er knew aught but rapture I am so preeminent in wretchedness that I can look with tranquil eye on all the horrors of the infernal courtmisnamed the Holy Can its gloomy caverns terrify the man who loaths the sight of day can eternal silence be a punishment to him to whom all converse with mankind is hateful or can the flames which fold around the victim of its wrath equal the fire which burns within my bosom No no the flames which kindle at the stake possess the mercy too to counteract the vengeance that employs them and soon consign the sufferer to eternal peace while here here in this tortured heart a fire more painful rages and yet will not destroy  Lopez  I mourn the cause of your distress my Lord whatever it be but I was sent to you to bear the greetings of my master and express his wish for your societyknowing you only by report as one who seemed of noble bearing and unhappy but when he shall find it is the Count Alphonso  Alph  Peace peace that name no more the sound is hateful to me And who are you that know me thus sequestered and disguised  Lopez  My Lord I was once your servant and honoured by your notice you may perhaps remember Lopez de M  el  Alph  Yes yes I do remember you you quitted me to travel with my brother  Lopez  I did my Lord just before your marriage  Alph  Silence tormentor  Lopez  My Lord  Alph  What daemon that delights to press with horrid touch upon the trem  ling nerve most sensitive to mortal agony has sent thee to perform his functions Begone thou agent of a fiend's malignity  Lopez  My Lord Heaven knows I meant not to offend you  Alph  Why then unfeelingly proclaim the event to which I owe my misery But perhaps I wrong you you may still be ignorant of my shame  Lopez  Your shame my Lord  Alph  Ay marriage was my shame my torment Oh Heaven her lovely face seemed to proclaim that every virtue dwelt within her brea  her beauty while it filled the eye with admiration enf rced homage from the heart for it appeared the loveliness of goodness I fancied poor deluded wretch that her whole soul was mine that unworthy as I was in me she fixed her Heaven of happinessha ha ha vain weak man and false false deceitful woman A few weeks absence lost me this treasure and to a stranger the acquaintance of a day she gave her heart  but he does not live to triumph in my pangs no thank Heaven vengeance still was left me  Lopez  Your cause of grief indeed my Lord is weighty but solitude will only cherish what the business and the pleasures of the world in time might dissipa  e  Alph  Talk not thus idly The worldshe was the world to me and now she is lost the link is snapped that bound me to creation the various passions which possess the human heart and point to different objects were in mine directed all to her Did I court honours 'twas to lavish them on Angelina did wealth seem worth possessing 't was that Angelina might command whatever wealth could purchase did I seek the circles of the gay it was that she might not know a pause from pleasure for all to me was irksome that compelled one thought or look to be withdrawn from herLeave me and by the regard which you profess report me to your master not as Alphonso but as a wretched nameless being to whom man can do no kindness but in shunning him as he shuns all mankind  Exeunt▪  SCENE III  DASHINGTON  disguised as a Friar and Sir  STURDY O'TREMOR  enter  Sir Stur  Upon my soul and you make a good portly reverendlooking kind of a friar  Dash  Yes and I have put on the habit of a priest to perform a priest's office to unite two lovers nobody can say I am out of character  Sir Stur  You can scarcely conceive the palpitation of my heart at this moment  Dash  Yes I can When you are so near the object of your heart's wishes it is a symptom very easy to be accounted for  Sir Stur  I declare now every nerve in my whole frame is in commotion  Dash  Natural enough  Sir Stur  Yes and I have such a fluttering here  Pointing to his chest  How my voice trembles  Dash  Very likely  Sir Stur  And with what difficulty I draw my breath  Dash  Plague take your fancies Because you are agitated with joy from the hope of regaining your mistress you'd make one believe you are in the agonies of death  Sir Stur  And if I were she'd bring me to life again But my dear friend confess now is n't it strange to find an effect produced upon every part of me  Dash  What when the woman you love is going to leap into your arms You are an odd fellow  Sir Stur  It clearly convinces me that all is not right  Dash  Now it clearly convinces me that all is right But I'll leave you now my Herculean invalid I'll go alone and reconnoitre the convent Mind that you follow me with caution  Exit  Dashington  SONG  Sir  STURDY O'TREMOR  Oh what a great flutter is here in my heart  And a queer sort of feel runs through every part  With a heigho dear me welladay  I so shiver that surely an ague I've got  But 't is sometimes a cold one and sometimes a hot  With a heigho c  My nerves all so friskily caper and prance  They're certainly learning St Vitus's dance  With a heigho c  With labour I force up each tremulous note  For the words I would utter they stick in my throat  With a heigho c  As sure as I live I'm in danger of death  For no sign so sure as a stoppage of breath  With a heigho c  My pulse comes and goes too so strangely good lack  I fear it will go and will never come back  With a heigho c  But when I my charmer shall see  Quickly will vanish all sorrow and pain  Oh let her bright eyes beam on me  Then pleasure will tingle in every vein  And once let me call her my own  Rapture will crown me by day and by night  Joy then will so mighty be grown  Oh I shall die with delight  Exit  SCENE IV  A Convent  DASHINGTON  and Sir  STURDY  enter  Dash  Now unless I succeed in managing the Cerberus of a gardener and get him to open the garden gate her escape is impossible for the walls you see are insurmountable  Sir Stur  Upon my soul here is a complete fortification see a light at the window yonder  Dash  But her voice must give us confirmation that it proceeds from her apartment Hush  AIR  JAQUELINA  from a Window in the Convent  How sweetly glide her tranquil days  Who free from Passion's sway  No wish beyond these walls betrays  Nor wafts one sigh away  Oh then 'tis heaven here to dwell  For seraphs cheer her lonely cell  But pity her whom cruel pow'r  A victim here has brought  To pine away each ling'ring hour  While absent ev'ry thought  Oh then 'tis horror here to dwell  For daemons haunt her dismal cell  Sir Stur  I declare I am ready to faint at hearing that sweet voice again  Dash  If there is to be any fainting pray leave that to the ladyHere comes the fellow that I must delude Now Sir Sturdy to your station be vigilant and if I succeed make good use of your opportunities  They both retire  Enter  JUAN  from the Garden  Juan  A hard kind of a service this of mine to be watch▪dog to a convent and spite of all my care I am afraid at last I shall lose some of my lambkins I have found many a sheep stealing rogue on the lookout hitherto I have been too sharp for them but what signifies the best care in the world when the goods you have to watch are as willing to be stolen as the thieves are to steal them Here comes a reverend father This is  the only set of men I a'n't afraid of Not because I think that holiness alway lies under a hood but because these father confessors being trusted with the sins of their female acquaintance why it is fair to imagine that if they are ever disposed to sin themselves they need not go out of their own neighbourhood to indulge their inclinations  DASHINGTON  comes forward  Juan  Save you father  Dash  Benedicite But tell me son what are you loitering about here for at so late an hour I hope you have no ill design  Juan  No I am placed here to prevent other people's ill designs  Dash  How am I to be convinced of that  Juan  I don't know that it concerns you  Dash  It does concern me muchMy zeal  Juan  Well well your zeal shall be satisfied These priests will pry into every body's business  Aside  Here here is the badge of my officeHere is the key of the gardens of the convent  Dash  Are you sure that is the key  Offering to take it  Juan  Am I sure Yes I am sure and I won't be called to account any more I am doing nothing but my duty  Dash  A sulky stubborn rascal this  Aside  I doubt very much that you are doing your duty I have strong apprehensions that you have some evil intention and therefore to prevent danger I'll alarm the convent I'll  Raising his voice a little  Juan  Silence don't let your zeal frighten my Lady Abbess and the whole nunnery I never met such a troublesome fellow in my life  Dash  If you don't instantly satisfy me I'll raise them all  Juan  Hush hush A'n't you ashamed of yourselfWhat shall I do If he call up my Lady Abbess I shall get into a scrape For she is a priestess and he's a priest and so being both parsons they'll take each other's part to a certainty  Aside  Well well I'll convince youThere there you shall find I am no impostorYou shall see it is the right key  Dash  Come then show me  Juan  opens the garden gate  Juan  Now are you satisfied  Dash  Yes yes now it is clear you are an honest fellow  Juan  Well then let me shut it again  Dash  Stay stay what a refreshing odour arises from the flowers in this garden and how neatly it is laid out Ay he is a skilful man he knows his business that has the management of these grounds  Juan  Why yesthough I say it myself I am as good a gardener as any in all this province  Dash  Ay or the next to it or all Spain you may say if you are the manI must be better acquainted with youI know something of your art and we'll converse together  Juan  Whenever you pleasebut I'll just shut the gate for  Dash  Not yet if you love me Delightful exquisite Keep it open a little longer my good friend and while one sense is so charmingly indulged we'll try if we can't gratify anotherHere brother floristhere is a bottle of choice stuff I never go unprovided  FINALE  DASHINGTON JUAN  Sir  STURDY JAQUELINA  Nuns and Friars  Dash  While the rose's sweet fragrance with pleasure's exhal'd  With wine's rosy juice let the taste be regal'd  Juan  Agreed and to prove my regard for the rose  I'll drink till I've painted its tints on my nose  Dash  Now's your time  In a whisper to Sir  Sturdy  while  Juan  is drinking  Sir Stur  My noble fellow  Dash  To  Juan  Come let's drink till we are mellow  Dashington  goes up to  Juan  and stands in such a manner as to block up his view of the gate while Sir  Sturdy  goes into the garden  Juan  What a flavour How delicious  Sir Stur  In the garden to  Jaquelina  Quick my love the time is precious  Dash  Fill again  Jaq  Oh how alarming  Juan  By the mass this wine is charming  Sir Stur  Pause no more  To  Jaq    Dash  To  Juan  Nay don't give over  Jaq  Oh I fear to trust my fate  Sir Stur  Can you doubt your faithful lover  Juan  Now I'll lock the garden gate  Sir Stur  All is lost then  Dash  To  Juan  No not yet man  Sir Stur  Leap or it will be too late  Dash  Sure the bottle you'll not quit man  Juan  But I'll lock the garden gate  Jaq  Spread your arms then to receive me  Sir Stur  Boldly leap and nothing fear  She leaps  Juan  What's that noise  Dash  There's none believe me  Juan  Hark again a noise I hear  Dash  Poh your brain with wine is heated  Juan  Ha a window open too  Dash  Psha What folly  Juan  Oh I'm cheated  Help here help I'm trick'd by you  Dash  Cease your bawling  To  Juan  Now or never  To Sir  Sturdy  in the garden  Sir Stur  and  Jaq  Coming out of the garden  Friend I'm bound to you for ever  Sir I'm bound to you for ever  Dash  Fly your safety lies in distance  Exeunt Sir  Sturdy  and  Jaquelina  Juan  Help Oh help here some assistance  Going into the garden  Dashington  following  Dash  Silence silence  Juan  Murder fire  Dash  Will that curs'd tongue never tire  Juan  suddenly springs out of the garden shutting the gate and leaving  Dashington  within  Juan  I've caught you my jolly friar  Nuns appear at the windows of the Convent and Friars and Singingboys enter as from an adjoining monastery  CHORUS  Whence this noise Why thus alarm us  Dash  Here am I a pris'ner fast  Nuns  Did this man intend to harm us  Juan  Yes and there he's safe at last  Dash  Ladies I no harm e'er meant you  I'm a sober modest man  CHORUS  What but mischief here has sent you  Juan  Now be jogging if you can  CHORUS  A villanous design is clear  No good 't is certain brought him here  Most sacrilegious his intent  And he shall meet due punishment  Dashington  joins in the chorus and sings  No villanous design is clear  That drunken rascal lock'd me here  Not sacrilegious my intent  And I defy your punishment  END OF ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  Don  Miguel  's House  LEONORA  and  VILETTA  enter  Viletta  AH Madam all your thoughts go to one object  Leo  Yes Viletta I can't help itI shall love him for ever Oh my dear handsome Englishman I'll be constant to you in spite of fate  Vil  How will you manage that dear Madam You must marry Don Miguel's son as soon as he comes from Lima  Leo  No I never will  Vil  It is impossible that you should prevent it You know your father at his death left Don Miguel absolute power over you as your guardian besides expressly enjoining that you should marry his son Don Philip  Leo  I don't carethe dear Englishman I met at Madrid when I was visiting my sister is the only man that shall ever have me for his wife  Vil  But pardon me if I say you seem to be constant without reason  Leo  Women you know will have their whims Many are inconstant without reason my whim is at any rate the most harmless  Vil  But consider he failed in his appointment when you had consented to elope with him He broke his word  Leo  That was very shocking to be sure But as I was the person wronged I conceive I have a right to forgive if I please besides I will never believe that he intended to deceive me No he is of a country too generous to abuse its conquests The vanquished in war the Briton treats with humanity will he then fail in tenderness to the heart that love has made his captive  Vil  Ay ay a woman in love can always make good excuses for her passion  Leo  That is extremely fortunate for there are very few disposed to make excuses for herWell I am determined to cherish the dear idea of enjoying happiness with the man of my choice  The hope which animates my heart  And makes me ev'ry fear dismiss  Deceitful joy can ne'er impart  No 't is the harbinger of bliss  So when at eve in tints of gold  The radiant clouds adorn the skies  They thus prepare us to behold  The morrow's sun in splendour rise  Yes I'll indulge the dear belief  That happy morrows are in store  And trust that voice which tells me grief  Shall never haunt my bosom more  The hope which animates c  Here comes my old sour▪faced guardian and yet to say truth of him he is like the cocoanut a rugged outside with a milky kernel  Don  Miguel de Lara  enters attended by inferior officers of the Inquisition he looks sternly at  Leonora  and  Viletta  and seats himself at a table  Juan  and Friars enter with him  Mig  Girls what do you stay here for don't you see I am on business  Leo  That is no reason we should go for your business may be our amusement  Mig  I am going to try a cause  Leo  I like to hear a cause tried of all things  Mig  But it is about carrying a lady away by force  Leo  Oh that must be very interesting I am determined to stay now  Mig  There it is whenever a cause comes on where something improper is expected to be brought forward the crier may bawl out "Ladies leave the court" till he croaks like a raven but the devil a woman will budge from her place  Leo  You are a very scandalous man Guardy and to show you how unjust you are we'll withdraw Come along Viletta  Exeunt  Mig  Poor things they are sadly balked Well let me hear what this proceeding has been where is the chief evidence    st Friar  Evidence my Lord We presumed that every thing of which the Holy Inquisition took cognizance was enveloped in secresy  Mig  You did did you Then let me tell you that if you come to me for justice you shall see her in open daylight for though she is blind herself she is not ashamed of being viewed by the whole world and those who pretend that she likes darkness best are desirous to palm off some base counterfeit in her place so let the witnesses stand forward and bring in the accused  DASHINGTON  enters guarded by Officers of the Inquisition  Dash  Well and who are you  Mig  Who am I My friend you seem to have changed places with me that may be a very proper question from the judge to the prisoner but I never heard of its being put by the prisoner to the judge So be so kind as to tell me who are you  Dash  Does n't my habit speak for me  Mig  Not very intelligibly it is one that commands respect from all when worn by him who himself respects it but a stain on that habit is more offensive than on any other the purer the garment the fouler do spots appear on it  Dash  Very true but don't look so devilish sour you frown most ferociously  Mig  Frown most ferociously why if I do you don't seem much terrified at it But I admit your censure mildness alone becomes the seat of justice the judge and the executioner should never look alike But what is the prisoner charged with Who accuses him  All the Friars  I I I  Mig  I I I Why what a volley of I's is poured all at once You are as eager as a shoal of porpoises to devour your wounded fellow    st Friar  No fellow of ours we disclaim him he is a wolf in sheep's clothing  Mig  And what are you If you are one of the flock I am sure you are a fierce old ram and look a great deal more mischievous than the wolf as you call him But who is he and what has he done  Juan  I'll tell your Lordship all  Dash  I'll save you the trouble brother florist and tell his Lordship myselfYou must know then my Lord that I have no more pretensions to this cowl than I have to the Pope's tiara I put it on to deceive old Cerberus there who by the by is a very honest mastiff and contrive to get the garden of the convent opened  Mig  Oh only to get the garden of the convent opened a very innocent device upon my soul  Dash  Was n't it I knew you'd think so you are a liberal man my Lord that can make allowances Those fellows seem to consider the grounds of a nunnery as their own manor and want to punish as poachers all gentlemen who go there in pursuit of their own game  Mig  A mighty hard case indeed that a gentleman can't pursue his own game for you  Dash  Ay there now a'n't you ashamed of yourselves But my Lord I did not go on sport of my own but merely to aid a friend  Mig  There you see the gentleman did not go on his own account but merely to assist a friend Well so you and your friend between you have contrived to carry away a few young ladies from the convent  Dash  A few only one my Lord upon my honour  Mig  Only one how moderate  Dash  And that one was a lady he doated on a lady whose heart was devoted to him as his to her and without whom existence would have been worse than death  Mig  Bless my soul and so they want to punish you merely for saving your friend's life How shocking

Office my Lord sentence me  Mig  Yes whether it will sentence you to be broke on the wheel or to die at the stake  Dash  Broke on the wheeldie at the stake  Mig  Yes I declare I have not a notion which  Dash  Oh you are joking ha ha ha it is devilish droll of you Broke on the wheel die at the stake ha ha how comical  Mig  No not very though I am uncertain which it will be one or the other I am positive  Dash  Lord you should not mention such horrible things even in jest I declare I feel hot and aching all over at the bare idea  Mig  Upon my life I don't wonder at it Leave your prisoner with

most horrid▪sensation  I feel at this terrible minute  A curse on this flameloving nation  That I should be ever caught in it  The bent of the mind  From its pleasures we find  And what is a Spaniard's delight  Why his great holiday  Is an auto da sé  And its bonfires the joy of his sight  Ah shortly there 'll be  A blaze made of me  At some joyful event's celebration  On a festival night  They 'll set me alight  To make part of a grand 'lumination  The national taste  In horror is plac'd  Their Escurial's a symbol of malice  They plainly to prove  For torture their love  In a

contented    st Rob  She must be cursed hard to please for if she were to search all Spain she would not find a more accomplished set of adventuring gentlemen    d Rob  Very true but you know an ill name goes a great way with prejudiced people and let a man be as valiant as Caesar and as fine a gentleman too only call him robber instead of conqueror and all his good qualities go for nothing    st Rob  What you say has too much truth in it But there must be something particular about this woman or she would surely know when she was well off What can you find out from her    d Rob  That her name is Angelina the wife of Count Alphonso d'Esparza and when we plundered her and brought her to this cavern she was in pursuit of her husband    st Rob  There you see Vasquez the perverseness of the sex Now ten to one if the husband had not run away from her but she would have run away from him this accounts for her dislike to us If her husband were of the party she would soon show us the preference    d Rob  But to business it is fixed that we shall plunder the house of Don Miguel the Inquisitor this very night    st Rob  I am ready the more desperate the business the better I like it    d Rob  Then this is an undertaking not to your mind for it will require more caution than enterprise as we are certain of easy admittance    st Rob  How    d Rob  We have discovered that this cavern communicates by a private entrance with a dungeon of Don Miguel the Inquisitor's house so in the dead of night we can make good our entrance without noise Look here comes the woman she is devilish handsome stand aside  ANGELINA  enters  SONG  ANGELINA  Pent within this cavern drear  Captive of a ruffian crew  Startled at each sound I hear  Shudd'ring at each face I view  In dread I pass the gloomy day  And weep the sleepless night away  Ere I mourn'd a fate so dire  Sorrow was an inmate here  Still her beams of heavenly fire  Hope display'd my breast to cheer  The gladd'ning ray she now

Well and what of him  Leo  That he is in danger of being punished  Mig  And ought he not to be punished  Leo  No I think not  Mig  Indeed What not for being concerned in carrying a lady from a convent  Leo  Noif the lady was willing to go from the convent  Mig  Really  Leo  Yes really Force certainly ought to be punished and therefore punish those dear Guardy who placed her there For surely it is a greater crime to put a lady into a convent against her consent than to take her away with her consent  Mig  The young gentleman has a mighty warm  advocate in you▪ and I really believe that if he were to be tried by a jury of spinsters they would not hesitate long in pronouncing himNot guilty  Leo  And do you now my dear crosslooking goodnatured Guardydo you pronounce himNot guilty Consider she is no nun that is carried off She had not taken the vows therefore there is no harm at all in what he has doneNow is there  Mig  A thought has struck meyou shall go to him  Leo  Shall I Oh thank you dear Guardy  Mig  Yes and you shall tell him from me that I so much compassionate his situation  Leo  That is so kind nowWell well  Mig  That I will exert all my interest  Leo  Ay do now there is a dear

me a great deal of trouble  Leo  Well well  Mig  That he had better  Leo  Better do what  Mig  Scamper away as fast as he can  Leo  Oh you dear good creatureI'll go to him directly  Mig  No no on second thoughts I'll order him to be brought here and I'll take measures so that nobody shall be in the way to prevent his escape  Exit  Miguel  Leo  How happy I am that this poor young man will be so soon freed from his fearsHow delightful it is to lift off the load of misery from the bosom sinking under its pressure Ah where is he who alone can banish affliction from my bosom  AIR  LEONORA  Again my absent love to meet  Severest toil with joy I'd greet  At noon through Afric's sands I'd go  At midnight pace the realms of snow  When found such rapture would be mine  As words can ne'er reveal

angelic creature  Going to embrace her  But I must not be too free with my raptures I remember I had a gentle hint once given me that you were another man's property  Leo  What do you meanI another's property Insulting man do you meanly attempt to defend your own inconstancy by falsely accusing me  Dash  Not I  I  don't accuse you of inconstancy I own myself greatly honoured by your very flattering partiality but  Leo  But what  Dash  Why as you know another person has a certain claim to you  Leo  That I conceive was  my  consideration not  yours  and when I offered you my heart were you mean enough to yield your claims to the frivolous pretensions of another Fie fie I thought more nobly of you  Dash  There it is nowwhen a woman has a mind to follow her inclinations her husband's claims are mere frivolous pretensions  Aside  Leo  No no inconstancy not fear induced you to break your appointment That penetrable bosom was pierced by some new object  Dash  My dear Madam you have hit it exactly  Leo  And do you confess it  Dash  Upon my soul there is no denying it  Leo  This audacity is insufferable  Dash  Patience for one moment my angelHeaven knows I mean this not in the language of figure but as mere dismal matter of fact My bosom  was  pierced by an object new to me but not such an object as your fancy pictures with a  smooth smiling face but by one with a pair of frowning brows and fierce mustachiosThe weapon that wounded me was not a sparkling eye but a damned long sharp toledo and instead of being prevented from observing my appointment by the act of breathing out my soul from my lips it was hurrying very fast out of my body from a hole that a friend of yours did me the kindness to drill through me  Leo  My torment is then returned and I am doomed to misery  Dash  TormentAh that means husband all the world over  Leo  But how was he acquainted with our attachment  Dash  To my shame I own by my indiscretion You remember at our last meeting you kindly fixed the day on which you would explain to me all the particulars of your situation and fly with me from Spain  Leo  Yes yeshow I repent my weakness  Dash  Business in the mean time called me some miles from MadridI however posted with a lover's speed to observe the appointmenta violent storm which though I was disposed to brave not all my efforts could persuade my steed to encounter obliged me to seek shelter at an inn There I found a  certain  gentleman likewise weatherbound Observing my anxiety to proceed on my journey he inquired the causeI foolishly revealed iton which he furiously called me villain bestowed some hearty curses on you Ma'amso to tilting we wentand as it happened he left me to all appearance not likely to be any man's rival in future  Leo  'Twas certainly Don Philip But how could you describe me for I never had revealed my name to you  Dash  But that I had unluckily discovered  Leo  What became of your adversaryWas he hurt  Dash  YesI pinked him a little But supposing me killed I learned that he was immediately removed in a litter and what became of him I know not  Leo  He is certainly dead  Dash  What then you have neither seen nor heard of him  Leo  No and you are now in the house of his father  Dash  The devil I am What then the old gentleman who was a little puzzled whether I should be broke on the wheel or die at the stake is his father  Leo  Yes  Dash  Oh then I dare swear he'll soon make up his mind  Leo  He had kindly consented to release you Fly fly while you have the power for should Don Miguel learn that you are the murderer of his son  During this speech Don  Miguel  enters behind  Mig  What do I hear The murderer of my son Oh the villain What a mercy it is that I have you still in my powerHere SanchoPerez  Two

tiger whelp  Dash  He pok'd me quite through the body  Leo  What he did he could not help  Dash  Bless me Sir you're vastly cruel  Mig  To revenge a murder'd son  Dash  and  Leo  He fell fairly in a duel  Which he would not let  me  him  shun  Mig  How can you plead for the villain  Leo  Sir I plead for justice sake  Dash  If I die your son for killing  Let it not be at the stake  Mig  You shall die my son for killing  And it shall be at the stake  Leo  Hear me plead for justice sake  Dash  Wedded to my country's fashion  I would rather far be hang'd  Mig  Zounds you but increase my passion

this garb of horrorWhen she is thus arrayed in night's black mantle adorned with vivid flamesthen then I hail her for she seems as she had not forgot there are such wretches as myself to whom her

and devils  But I wish that were the worst part of the business If they would let me out alive and with whole bones I would be contented to do penance in this pretty vestment up St James's Street and Bond Street for the rest of my life Nay that would be no punishment for I dare swear as soon as this queer coat was seen there it would be thought ugly enough to come into fashion All my fine women too in compliment to me would dress  à l' Inquisition  and for a whole season at least nothing would be voted stylish that was not of the devil and bonfire patternBut here am I lodged in this black hole and my only  promenade  will be to a bundle of faggots where I and my jacket will be turned into cinders and tinder Oh curse it how horrible Never did I expect to make such a flaming exit  A

heape such anguish on that heart as falsehood hath lodged here Let me behold the face of her whose sorrows I conceive akin to mine Immortal powers Has madness mastered my poor tortured brain and do my eyes act as the vassals of distempered fancy or has just Heaven thus by a miracle directed the guilty Angelina to her wronged husband to enforce the vengeance due to her crime  Pauses  All surrounding objects are reflected to my sense with truth's distinctnessCan I err only here No no 'Tis she and sent that death death by his hand she hath wronged may expiate her perfidy Why does my heart shrink from an act of justice How misery disarms resentment Yes yes 'tis that unnerves me Did I behold her in the hall of splendour decked in the robes of gaiety her eyes sparkling with bliss then should I rush eager for vengeance and exult to lay triumphant guilt in ruin But here I view a wretched creature whom Heaven's hand hath humbled Is that pale cheek where sufferance is marked with care's sure tracesis that a stimulant to vengeance Poor illfated girl Thy heart has played thee treacherouslyit wanted firmness to prevent thy falsehood and yet has not been slack to upbraid thee with it I did not think to have wept for thee frail Angelina but thus thus fallen even I can pity thee  Alphonso  turns away weeping  Ang  Wakes and looks round  SoftWhere am I My mind is confusedAy ay now I

at his feet  Alph  True you do indeed behold him who was once your kind protector  Turning towards her  Ang  Oh Heaven My Alphonso Then am I blest here will I cling for ever  Throws herself into his

by the tongue of some base wretch  Alph  It hasby his to whom you gave your honourNow now false woman what will avail your protestations Now call to Heaven to witness for your faith and damn yourself more deeply 'Twas not the breath of doubtful rumour told an absent husband that his wife was faithless Nothe cursed tongue that lured you to dishonour that tongue pronounced the infernal truth andbecame dumb for ever  Ang  Then justly did a villain perish for if ever the tongue of mortal could truly charge me with an act however trivial or one word or look that spoke my heart wandering from thee may Heaven withhold from me its mercy and let the fiercest pangs that dying sinners tremble at be my eternal lot Oh my Alphonso spurn not as faithless her whose dearest only joy has been thy love her who if all the world combined to load thee with its hate would still cling to thee with increasing fondness and who if miseries pressed on thy brain too great for reason to support would tend thee in the cell of madness and even there derive more ecstasy from one kind look given in the transient intervals of sense than all the unruffled  pleasures that the world without thee can afford  Alph

surely waken some tenderness for their poor mother  Alph  Angelina  Endeavouring to suppress his tears  Shame on this weakness but think not though my eyes betray a sympathy with misery that my soul can sympathize with guilt or that the sacred compact of affection plighted to purity shall remain firm to falsehood To chain the living to the dead is not to nature more repugnant than to link honour

SCENE IV  The Dungeon  JUAN  discovered  I believe I am safe yetOh that I may continue soMay be the devils don't think me worth fetching I pray heartily they may hold in that mind Never shall I forget the frightful sight I have not courage yet to look to the side of the dungeon where they vanishedIf I were to stay here for a year I should not take a wink of sleep for fear of finding myself when I waked in a place a great deal too hot for my constitutionWhat a terrible thing it is to be kept in such a quaking  stateI heard a noiseI hear it againOh I am a lost man  He falls down hiding his face  DASHINGTON  and  JAQUELINA  enter through the private avenue  Dash  Well we have got out of the Robbers' clutchesStill I wish we had escaped into a more agreeable place  Jaq  Since we are safe from those wretches I feel perfect security  Dash  But the little account I have to answer I am not at all convinced will be settled to my satisfactionWho have we hereSome poor devil  Juan  I am no devil and I wish to have nothing to do with devilsOhOh  Dash  Look up  Juan  I dare not look at any thing so frightful  Dash  Look up my good fellow  Juan  Don't think to wheedle me BeelzebubI defy the devil and all his works  MIGUEL  and Officers enter  Mig  Now I shall see if this fellow can't give a better accountHey what's hereWhy this is sorcery with a witnessA woman tooWhat Signor Conjuror you found you did not like solitary confinement and flew away to fetch yourself a companion  Dash  If you will allow me my Lord to remove from this place or at least conduct this lady to a pleasanter apartment you may very easily be satisfied as to what now raises your wonder  Mig  Why Sir as you clearly have the knack of flying through stone walls I conclude you will  be just as safe in one place as anotherSo come with me and let me know the particulars of this extraordinary transaction and you blockhead  To  Juan  you may come too Pray Sir  To  Dashington  walk before me that if you do take it into your head to vanish again I may at least have the pleasure of seeing whether you fly or sink or go off in a flash or how  Exeunt  SCENE V  ANGELINA  enters supported by Sir  STURDY O'TREMOR  Sir Stur  Oh yes my dear Madam I am certain I met the very man you inquire after He looked scared and yet furioushis eyes starting out of his head and he ran past me as if he was flying for his life I declare the sight of him gave me a queer kind of feela sort of a qualm all over He seemed for all the world as if the rope had snapped with him at the gallows and he was running away half hanged  Ang  Oh my failing strengthCould I follow him I might still convince him of my innocence  Sir Stur  And is it that he doubtsOh what a misbeliever he must beWhy the man that can't read innocence in that sweet face knows nothing of Heaven's handwriting  DASHINGTON  enters  Dash  Ah my dear friend have I found you at last  Sir Stur  Oh the sight of you rejoices my heart But I have lost my dear girl  Dash  And I have found your dear girl  Sir Stur  What do you tell me  Dash  Nothing but truth she is safe and I am safe and all is right but you brought me into a pretty scrapeI was very near getting a niche in the Book of Martyrs by you  Sir Stur  Hey  Dash  Nay this is no time to dwell on past perilsJaquelina impatiently expects you so make haste to her  Sir Stur  But this lady needs protection  Dash  Mine is devoted to her There is one of my servants he will conduct you to your mistress while this lady may command from me whatever service she requires So without ceremony fly as fast as your wornout frame will suffer you  Exit Sir  Stur  Ang  Sir do not let me tax your kindness nor dull your joy with my misfortunes  Dash  Madam happiness never found entrance in that breast which was not open to the sorrows of a lovely woman  Ang  You are truly generous but indeed it grieves me much to trespass thus You are burdened with a being whose mind is rent with agony and whose frame is enfeebled with fatigue and anguish  Dash  Take comfort Madam and hope for happiness lean on my arm and let me conduct you to safety and repose  Ang  I am bound to you for ever  She leans on him and as they are going  Alphonso  enters  Alph  Horror 'tis he Such a sight would brace the arm of palsied cowardice and in the breast of mercy's self infuse a tiger's fury Matchless extent of woman's perfidy a few hours past with all the seeming of unshaken constancy wert  thou not kneeling at my feet adjuring Heaven to witness for thy innocence and now my eyes behold thee in the arms of thy cursed paramour Villain I thought my sword had long since paid the debt I owed thee I'll now make justice certainand first to deal it herefalse woman die  Rushes at  Angelina  who faints and is supported by  Dashington  he defending her with his sword Sir  Sturdy  enters and runs between them he is followed by  Leonora  and  Jaquelina  Sir Stur  I thought this wildlooking gentleman would be falling foul of somebody Sir if you don't curb your passions you may depend on it they will injure your health  Leo  Heavens my sister  Ang  My dearest Leonora  Leo  But whence this fury and distraction How altered are your husband's looks  Ang  Altered indeed my sister some dreadful error has possession of his mind  Alph  Error Oh shameless woman Can it be error now there stands the author and proclaimer of your infamy  Dash  Sir  Ang  Heaven can witness for me that till this hour I ne'er beheld his face  Dash  Give me leave Sir to say that you are a most incomprehensible gentleman I am ready to admit that on a certain stormy day when you and I were weatherbound I was more communicative than I ought to have been to a stranger but may devils fly away with me in reality if I ever mentioned to you that lady's name which even yet I have not the honour of knowing I only named to you the Lady Angelina d'Esparza  Alph  And who but she is owner of that name  Dash  Why that lady is n't she  Pointing to  Leonora  Pray Ma'am is n't your name Angelina d'Esparza  Leo  No that is my sister's name the wife of Don Alphonso  Dash  Whew here is a business Am I really awake or is this all a dream Did I or did I not see you at Madrid  Leo  You did while I was on a visit to my sister during Don Alphonso's absence  Dash  AndLord I begin to find that I have made a cursed deal of mischief The house Madam where you did me the honour to receive me and allow me to express my passion was  Leo  My sister's and to my shame I own from apprehension that she would disapprove my conduct it was without her knowledge I received you  Dash  To  Angelina  My dear Ma'am I beg you a million of pardons and my dear Sir notwithstanding you made a lunge clean through me I confess you have great reason to be offended but you see it was all a mistake  Alph  But whence could this mistake arise Leonora would never surely in her sister's name receive the visits of a lover  Dash  No Sir she admitted my visits under no name at all and obliged me too to promise not to make inquiries Her commands I punctually obeyed but at our last interview as I was quitting the house I heard a passerby exclaim "There lives the beauteous Angelina d'Esparza" I therefore naturally concluded that the beauteous Angelina was this lady  To  Leonora  Sir Stur  What a blunder and it is most extraordinary that though there is an Irishman among you he has had no hand in it  Ang  Alphonso  Alph  Oh forgive me dearest Angelina  Dash  Although I confess myself horribly to blame I must say Ma'am  To  Angelina  that husband of yours is as hasty a gentleman as ever jerked a sword out of its scabbard The moment I mentioned the name out came that damned long toledo and in three seconds it was through me Upon my soul the greatest blame is due to your rashness  Leo  No to your tattling  Sir Stur  Ah that is a devil of a fault never kiss and tell  Don  MIGUEL  enters  Mig  So I have found you out at last and I am happy to tell you that those desperate ruffians whom you  To  Dashington  hindered from cutting our throats are all in safe custody But what do you stay here so long for There is a devilish good dinner ready so come in and be jolly  Leo  We have discovered the error Sir which led us to suppose that this gentleman had encountered your son  Mig  Why I was sure it must turn out a mistake for I have it under my son's own hand that he is at Lima and intends to remain there and I am not sorry to find that he has taken himself a wife since you wish to take another man for your husband  Dash  And may I hope Sir that you will consent to my marriage with your ward  Mig  I consent with all my soul She is to be married not I and therefore I don't see that my inclination has any thing to do but to follow hers  Sir Stur  Ah my sweet Jaquelina if your father would think in this manner it would be the saving of my life  Jaq  And of mine too  Mig  Would it Why then I have the satisfaction of telling you that her father is now perfectly disposed to let her please herself He only placed her in a convent till he had informed himself thoroughly of your character and fortune with both which he is now perfectly satisfied  Sir Stur  Then I am the happiest man living  Dash  What with such a catalogue of maladies  Sir Stur  Love has cured them all and I feel at this moment that I am as stout a man as ever  Mig  If you are notHercules must have been a shrimp to you  Leo  Now my dear Guardy I have but one favour to ask which is that you will relinquish your office and cease to be an Inquisitor  Mig  To that I can't consent for I am not sure that any other person holding my office would do so little mischief as myself  Dash  Yours is the system of true philanthropyNot to be contented with simply doing good but also to labour to prevent the evil designs of othersnot only to practise virtue but to preserve the helpless from virtue's foes  FINALE  From sorrow and perils tormenting  Since now we are happily free  Our pleasure in harmony venting  Let's pour forth the numbers of glee  So merrily merrily singing  Let joy's sprightly sound  Be wafted around  While the bells are so merrily ringing  What transport misfortunes ideal  And springing from error to find  And those transports will all become real  If you to our errors prove kind  Then merrily merrily c  THE END  BOOKS LATELY PUBLISHED
