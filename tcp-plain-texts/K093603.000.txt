 One Thousand Eight Hundred  OR I WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR BEING A  CHOICE COLLECTION  OF FAVOURITE SONGS ON SERIOUS MORAL AND LIVELY SUBJECTS  Written and carefully revised  BY GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY  When Winter nights grow dull and long  Propose the dance or sing your song  Or join concordant in some glee  For Life should never vapid be  TEWKESBURY PRINTED BY W DYDE AND SOLD BY WEST AND HUGHES PATERNOSTERROW C CHAPPLE PALLMALL AND S REED STRAND LONDON  To Mr INCLEDON  SIR  FROM the very eminent line you are ranked in as a vocal performer and the great pleasure I have often received when I have heard you sing some of the following Songs I thought there would be no impropriety trusting at the same time that you would not take it amiss were I to inscribe the following little work to you I have been the more particularly urged to publish my songs in this manner from hearing of the frequent applications which have been made for them to almost every bookseller in town who have not had it in their power until now to gratify their different customers There are more people  capable of reading than singing a song therefore those that have not studied music sufficiently may have the opportunity of looking over the words in the closet many of them have been set by some of the most able composers and many also by the most moderate ones which have often been the cause of putting the reader out of humour with the words from the musician's misconception of the subject or his deficiency in respect to effect and harmony Many an author has had the mortification of seeing his words martyred by the composer of the music who has evidently shewn by his emphasis if I may be allowed that phrase being wrongly placed that although he might be full master of his science so far as to know a crotchet from a minim yet if you had set him to read perhaps he did not know a substantive from a verb and a total stranger altogether of antithesis or inflection in such case good words are often prostituted through ignorance which is as mortifying as if any body were to put a valuable piece of broad cloth into the hands of an unskilful Taylor who having no taste in respect to fashion or shape  often produces a coat not only unfit to be worn but unfit to be seen also from which reason it has disgusted and been thrown upon the shelf to rot in oblivion And on the other hand many a song which has been meerly  measure  without the least pretention to the name of Poetry divested at the same time of instructive matter as well as of figure or incident has become a favourite ditty with the Public from the ingenuity of the composer of the music who may have been lucky enough to give it a good tune  In the above instance we are told the Italian composers do often excel and the late ingenious Bonnel Thornton joint writer of the Connoisieur has in some part of his works given us a translation of one of their popular airs which we also find to be strictly  measure  and runs thus  " Where which and wherefore  " There this and therefore"  This is a kind of fashionable  scaffolding  for the music which the composer  builds  upon  and finishes his part by  line  and  rule  like a good mason or bricklayer who never considers or looks into the imperfection of the architect but is perfectly contented that he has finished  his  part of the business well let the superstructure be ever so contemptible but you are a better judge of music than I am and if this metaphor should not hold good you will be kind enough to pardon  Sir  Your most obedient Servant GEO S CAREY  CONTENTS  I

FAVOURITE SONGS  I WISH YOU AN HAPPY NEW YEAR  JOHN ENGLISH who often would speak without thought  Not having the judgment to think as he ought  From custom let danger be ever so near  Wou'd annually wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR  Should our coast be in danger and people afraid  Lest the French or the Dutch should our country invade  Give John but his Pipe and his good Christmas cheer  He'll greet all his friends WITH AN HAPPY NEW YEAR  Some people call Johnny a national hack  He bears such a national load on his back  Should trade become dull and should dockets appear  Yet Johnny shall wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR  Should Monopoly threaten or Famine surround  And nothing about us but misery found  When at every dwelling long faces appear  Kind Johnny shall wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR  Without knowing the fate of the following day  Or what heavy demands without money to pay  Tho' the weather be bad or provisions be dear  Yet Johnny shall wish you A HAPPY NEW YEAR  'Tis a wish that our ancestors us'd to bestow  In the good times of old we all very well know  But those times are over all wise people fear  Who laugh when you talk of A HAPPY NEW YEAR  THE LOYAL TAR  'SDEATH what a fuss landlubbers make  About their rights and laws  As if in doubt what part to take  And jar as 'twere for straws  If they wou'd do the thing that's right  Or cease prevarication  Like loyal tars they wou'd unite  To save this envy'd nation  Much talking argues little good  For many do remark  That our has not the truest blood  Which is too apt to bark  True courage ne'er delights in noise  But when there is occasion  The loyal tar each nerve employs  To save his envy'd nation  Let Frenchmen say whate'er they will  And pass such mad decrees  That each a brother's blood shall spill  Or father's if they please  We are not quite so savage grown  To ape so strange a fashion  Each loyal tar will guard the crown  His king his friend and nation  THE MASON'S ALLEGORY  THE trade of a Mason's a good moral school  Where the  measures  of life are establish'd by  rule  When affairs go awry let your judgment incline  To make matters  even  by drawing the  line  Shou'd your paths being crooked bewilder the mind  Or encircl'd by care no alternative find  Ne'er let your guide Reason give way to despair  Old Time with exertion your troubles may  square  Shou'd you meet with a brother in  craft  too profound  Make use of your  plummet  his subtilty  sound  And if you no  bottom  should find in his heart  When his hand he presents you then bid him depart  Let your converse be  level  your life not too gay  But just within compass the moderate way  When you're crippl'd by age infirm and oppress'd  Let Faith lend a  pillar  on which you may rest  THE SOLDIER'S RESOLUTION  SEE the night's ta'en its leave the streamers of day  Begin from the eastward to dart  The ravilia beats and I'm summon'd away  'Tis hard my dear Betsey to part  It is not the foe in the field that I dread  Nor the point of the glittering steel  It is not the whistling bullet of lead  'Tis parting with thee that I feel  I must not indulge in the thought of my dear  The bustle of war is around  The bellowing trumpet blows loud in the ear  My spirits start up at the sound  I'll fight for my king as a soldier should fight  Yet were I to 'scape with my life  When the wars are all o'er 'twou'd be my delight  To make my dear Betsey my wife  THE DISCONSOLATE SAILOR  WHEN my money was gone that I gain'd in the wars  And the world 'gan to frown at my fate  What matter'd my zeal or my honoured scars  When indifference stood at each gate  The face that would smile when my purse was well lin'd  Shew'd a different aspect to me  And when I could nought but ingratitude find  I hi'd once again to the sea  I thought it unwise to repine at my lot  To bear with cold looks on the shore  So I pack'd up the trifling remnants I'd got  And a trifle alas was my store  A handkerchief held all the treasure I had  Which over my shoulder I threw  Away then I trudg'd with a heart rather sad  To join with some jolly ship's crew  The sea was less troubl'd by far than my mind  For when the wide main I survey'd  I could not help thinking the world was unkind  And fortune a slipp'ry jade  And I vow'd if once more I could take her in tow  I'd let the ungrateful ones see  That the turbulent winds and the billows could shew  More kindness than they did to me  THE DISCONSOLATE SAILOR'S RETURN  ONCE more I return'd to my own native shore  Which I left so dejected so heartless and poor  Each face look'd indignant and shy  I sought for relief on the perilous main  And Fortune she cheer'd my poor heart once again  While I brav'd the caprice of the sky  Tho' death seem'd impatiently waiting around  With sharppointed lightning and thunder profound  Or roar'd in the turbulent wind  When a calm has return'd I've said to each mate  Tho' the heavens have frown'd there's nothing I hate  So much as the frowns of mankind  I had not forgot how my heart was oppress'd  And slighted by those whom I'd often caress'd  And parted my penny so free  But if ever dame Fortune shou'd leave me again  No more shall ingratitude give me a pain  I'll seek for resource on the sea  MARY OF THE TYNE  WHAT pleasure oft' 'tis to reveal  The pain or pleasure that we feel  'Tis bliss while either we impart  Unto a sympathetic heart  Just like that sweet heart of thine  My lovely Mary of the Tyne  I lose when near thee all my care  When from thee I am all despair  My bosom heaves with anxious pain  Until I meet with thee again  What are the adverse pangs of mine  My lovely Mary of the Tyne  Say is it from thy beauteous face  Or is it from thy natural grace  Or is it thy angelic mind  Or is it ev'ry one combin'd  Making one sweet form divine  My lovely Mary of the Tyne  Shou'd it be love thou'lt sure forgive  That is the food on which I live  But if thou shou'dst that bliss deny  Then must thy faithful lover die  Or linger out his life and pine  For lovely Mary of the Tyne  THE MAID OF THE ROCK  I SAT out one eve with intention to roam  To the Rock where the surges wantonly play  When the owl had stol'n out from his secret home  And brightvested Hesperus clos'd in the day  The moon was at full and with dignity rose  And tissu'd with silver the greenmantl'd seas  The God of the ocean was gone to repose  And Aeolus fann'd with a whispering breeze  On reaching the cave where old legends report  And many a sorrowful tale has been sung  Where bloodhunting robbers have oft held their court  On each side was some vestige of chivalry hung  My eyes were alarm'd on beholding a maid  Who near to the cavern sat silent in grief  Her head on her hand all in sorrow was laid  A hard rocky pillow was all her relief  She started with fear and she fain would have fled  I begg'd her to stay and her sorrows relate  Then told her from me she had nothing to dread  That I was sent there by the order of fate  You came by the order of one she reply'd  Who has done all she can to distract my poor mind  O'erwhelm'd in the deep my dear William my pride  Then sunk and she gave her last breath to the wind  THE AFFECTIONATE SOLDIER  'TWAS in the ev'ning of a wint'ry day  When safe returning from a long campaign  Allen o'ertoil'd and weary with the way  Came home to see his Sally once again  His batter'd arms he carelessly threw down  And view'd his Sally with enraptur'd eyes  But she receiv'd him with a modest frown  She knew not Allen in his rough disguise  His hair was knotted and his beard unshorn  His tatter'd 'coutrements about him hung  A tear of pleasure did each cheek adorn  And blessings fell in torrents from his tongue  Am I so alter'd by this cruel trade  That you your faithful Allen have forgot  Or is your heart unto another stray'd  Ahwhy escap'd I from the murd'ring shot  When thus he spake her wonted colour fled  She ran and sunk upon her Allen's breast  All pale awhile she look'd like one that's dead  He kiss'd she breath'd and all her love confess'd  Yes my delighttho' alter'd as thou art  Reduc'd by honest courage to this state  Thou art the golden treasure of my heart  My longlost husband and my wish'dfor mate  SEQUEL TO POLL OF PLYMOUTH  WHEN Edward first heard Poll of Plymouth was dead  The functions of life made a pause  His piteous eyes stood aghast in his head  His shipmates enquir'd the cause  Reviving awhile he address'd them around  His hand closely press'd on his heart  Within this sad letter at once I have found  The spectre of death and his dart  It tells that my dear Poll of Plymouth is dead  My comfort my joy and my wife  When I was torn from her she flew to her bed  And sighing resign'd her dear life  He fancy'd he saw his dear Poll in the clouds  Ah stay for poor Edward he cries  Then swift as his fancy he ran up the shrouds  And eagerness flash'd in his eyes  He call'd for all hands and he gave a loud shriek  And now all distracted he raves  Said do you not see that my heart's sprung a leak  Then threw himself into the waves  All hands were employ'd to prevent his sad fate  And the longboat was put out in vain  That drags him aboard but alas 'twas too late  For he never once breathed again  THE SHIPWRECKED BOY  'TWAS near a rock within a bay  Where many a shatter'd vessel rides  An ample cottage shelter'd lay  Which overlook'd the ebbing tides  Its calm inhabitants would view  The ocean struggling with the sky  When e'er the northern tempests blew  Or when each wave ran mountains high  Once at the closing of a day  When angry Boreas in his rage  Had clear'd the dark'ning clouds away  Which caus'd a thund'ring war to wage  A shipwreck'd seaboy pale and spent  With buffeting the threat'ning waves  Straight to the peaceful cottage went  And bending low for succour craves  He told his tale with feeble voice  For he'd a heart that could not feign  The list'ning hearers all rejoice  That he was safe on land again  The parents and the children strove  Who now should first his wants supply  While pity caus'd each heart to move  And sympathy fill'd ev'ry eye  The can was fill'd the fire was made  To cheer and dry their drenched guest  For each brought something to his aid  And anxiously the boy caress'd  At length reviv'd express'd his mind  And shew'd his gratitude so plain  Forgot the thunder and the wind  Resolv'd to try the sea again  THE SHIPWRECKED BOY AT HOME  THE goddess of war threw her spear on the ground  And Peace wav'd her olivebranch gracefully round  A stillness now reign'd o'er the widespreading main  The Syrens began a melodious strain  The shipwrecked seaboy his troubles forgot  The yawn of the waves and the whistling shot  His dear native home strongly press'd on his mind  His parents and sisters so loving and kind  He hurry'd fast on with his heart all elate  To embrace them around and his story relate  His hardearned wages he long'd to divide  'Mongst those that he lov'd near his own fireside  But when he arriv'd say what pen can express  The genial delight the joy in excess  So welcome at home was this brave little guest  You'd have thought that their welcoming ne'er would have ceas'd  He hail'd 'em around and he smiled with glee  Cry'd hold out your hands take this present from me  A fine silken 'kerchief each neck to enfold  But gave to his parents a purse full of gold  The fidler was sent for that liv'd on the green  Such dancing and romping sure never was seen  They gambol'd 'till Phoebus peep'd over the shed  Then kissing and blessing went peaceful to bed  THE FURLOUGHED SOLDIER  AS I've plodded my way to some far country town  Full many a wearisome day  My purse has contain'd but a scanty halfcrown  And that has soon melted away  Oft weary and sad in some wint'ry road  With rain I've been wet to the skin  Of my knapsack grown tir'd I've sought for abode  At some friendly good alehouse or inn  I've hop'd that good fortune on turning her wheel  Wou'd cast me perchance on the place  Where the wound in my bosom would instantly heal  At the sight of my Sally's dear face  She grieves for she knows how I'm destin'd to roam  On the strength of my furlough to rest  And then she oft wishes her Allen at home  To bury his cares in her breast  ON YONDER STILE  A DUET  ON yonder stile let's sit awhile  To hear the nightingale  The lazy moon will get up soon  And silver o'er the vale  Ah did you know the pangs I feel  I can no longer now conceal  The tender tale I must reveal  On yonder stile let's sit awhile  To hear the nightingale  The lazy moon will get up soon  And silver o'er the vale  The golden sun his race has run  The linnet seeks her nest  The shepherd's care all folded are  While he plods home to rest  Then let us Phoebe William onward move  Unto the streamlet near the grove  And while I whisper o'er my love  On yonder stile let's sit awhile  And hear the nightingale  The lazy moon will get up soon  And silver o'er the vale  ALLEN BROOKE OF WINDERMERE  SAY have you in the village seen  A lovely youth of pensive mein  If such a one hath passed by  With melancholy in his eye  Where is he gone ah tell me where  'Tis Allen Brooke of Windermere  Last night he sighing took his leave  Which caus'd me all the night to grieve  And many maids I know there be  Who try to wean my love from me  But heaven knows my heart's sincere  To Allen Brooke of Windermere  My throbbing breast is full of woe  To think that he should serve me so  But if my love should anger'd be  And try to hide himself from me  Then death shall bear me on a bier  To Allen Brooke of Windermere  LOVE WITHOUT RETURN  WHERE are those hours fled  That us'd to yield delight  My days with pleasure sped  And sweet repose at night  Within the shaded cot  Which stands on yonder lea  It was alas my lot  My Mary first to see  Ah were her love like mine  How happy had I been  Crown'd with such bliss divine  While Mary reign'd my queen  But she increas'd my woe  While at her feet I sigh'd  Disdain sat on her brow  Which all my love defy'd  If beauty makes her vain  My Mary sure is wrong  For ah who can retain  Or boast of beauty long  My love is so sincere  Should time her charms disguise  I'd love my Mary dear  'Till death enclos'd my eyes  THE VALETUDINARIAN  YE that groan beneath the weight  Of dissipation pride or state  Condemn'd to walk through life's parade  At rout or drum or masquerade  Ye that fain would pleasure find  Led by Fortune ever blind  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquility  Or if chac'd by sallow care  Would you shun the hag Despair  Would you chearful health restore  When advice can do no more  Seek the fresh reviving breeze  Or the fanning of the trees  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquility  Ye that feel the pangs of love  Come and murmer with the dove  Shun the false ungrateful maid  Seek the sweet sequester'd shade  Let her ne'er behold thy grief  Time ere long will bring relief  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquility  Ye that languish to regain  A breaking heart or racking brain  Driv'n by fortune or by fate  To a wild and frantic state  Or mopeing wander like a loon  Dreading oft the wayward moon  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquility  THE DROOPING ROSE  GO drooping Rose by heat oppress'd  Go and revive on Mary's breast  Her breast benign doth all excel  Go there my Rose go there and dwell  Not in the vale nor on the hill  Where summer gales their honey spill  Not Flora's temples when she's drest  Are half so fair as Mary's breast  Were I to live 'till I be old  And pinch'd by keen December's cold  I should revive were I to rest  My aged head on Mary's breast  THE SAILOR'S ALLEGORY  LIFE's like a ship in constant motion  Sometimes high and sometimes low  Where ev'ry one must brave the ocean  Whatsoever wind may blow  If unassail  d by squall or shower  Wafted by the gentle gales  Let's not lose the fav'ring hour  While success attends the sails  Or if the wayward winds shou'd bluster  Let us not give way to fear  But let us all our patience muster  And learn from reason how to steer  Let judgment keep you ever steady  'Tis a ballast never fails  Should dangers rise be ever steady  To manage well the swelling sails  Trust not too much your own opinion  While your vessel's under way  Let good example bear dominion  That's a compass will not stray  When thund'ring tempests make you shudder  And Boreas on the surface rails  Let good discretion guide the rudder  And Providence attend the sails  Then when you're safe from dangers riding  In some welcome port or bay  Hope be the anchor you confide in  And Care awhile enslumber'd lay  Or when each can's with liquor flowing  And good fellowship prevails  Let each true heart with rapture glowing  Drink success unto our sails  STRANGERS AT HOME  NOW we've drank to the king to our lasses and friends  And the Muses appear as the liquor ascends  Setting Fancy awing or on tiptoe to roam  For a song or a catch to make  Strangers at home  May the man be despis'd of whatever degree  Who has wealth without feeling to make a friend free  May his wife night and morning his caput well comb  Who's in want of a heart to make  Strangers at home  Or the boor that will frown when an alien appears  Whose heart fills his bosom with national fears  That encloses his door if from Paris or Rome  Some poor stranger might knock who's in want of a home  Or when merit appears in her scanty attire  That may want a good meal or the warmth of a fire  May the wretch that denies her ne'er enter this dome  To chill the warm hearts of us  Strangers at home  And may he that's a stranger to friendship and love  Be deny'd all those blessings we hope for above  May his mind be perplex'd by some spellsetting gnome  Who cannot as we do make  Strangers at home  Let us join all our hands with a bountiful mind  And each to his neighbour be cordial and kind  May the spirit of light when we're rais'd from the tomb  Give us all a free welcomeas  Strangers at home  HOLD YOUR JAW  ACIT much distress'd  A statesman address'd  Respecting the silencing law  The statesman reply'd  But spoke it aside  The meaning is  hold your Jaw  Hold your Jaw c c  In forming a mob  To plunder or rob  Or seize an old friend by the craw  This law points the way  To Botany Bay  Then prithee man  hold your Jaw  Hold your Jaw c c  Old Gallica sat  As snug as a rat  Conceal'd in a bundle of straw  Would have eat all our fat  Had not sly pussy cat  Cry'd sirrah  pray hold your Jaw  Hold your Jaw c c  To judge matters right  Requires good sight  Or wou'd you the proper line draw  Pray run not your rig  On Tory or Whig  But prudently  hold your Jaw  Hold your Jaw c c  Let each hasty soul  His passion control  Remember wise Solomon's saw  In venting your spite  You'll get nothing by't  'Twere better to  hold your Jaw  Hold your Jaw c c  May each gallant crop  Who's head's like a mop  With care keep his eye on his taw  For shou'd his long tongue  Cause him to be hung  He'd certainly  hold his Jaw  Hold his Jaw c c  A MONSTROUS GOOD SONG  YE poets employ all the force of your lays  To suppress all the ills of these troublesome days  When Justice sits blindfolded crippl'd and lame  Say do you not think it a  monstrous shame  In talking of Monsters it puts one in mind  Of the numbers we have who all differ in kind  Yet each is permitted to play a foul game  Say do you not think it a  monstrous shame  The great men who're deep in the nation's affairs  Oft play up old Nick with the Bulls and the Bears  With a hum all Change Alley they set in a flame  Say do you not think it a  monstrous shame  The Lawyer's so deep in his logical skill  He's sure to entangle you do what you will  Shou'd he fail or succeed in your cause 'tis the same  Say do you not think it  a monstrous shame  The Methodist drives on a monstrous trade  By setting up scarecrows to make us afraid  Till kicking in fits you see many a Dame  Say do you not think it  a monstrous shame  Say is't not the very worst species of vice  That the comforts of life are so high in their price  That knaves by collusion shou'd play us this game  I swear and protest 'tis  a monstrous shame  Sure every good man must see with much pain  That the Monster MONOPOLY's suffer'd to reign  But shou'd he reign long ev'ry mortal's to blame  And if he's not hang''tis  a monstrous shame  The report of each day which is bawl'd in our ears  Is a monster which often is made by our fears  Report tells us fibs some dark purpose to frame  That the world will believeis  a monstrous shame  HE SAW I LOV'D  LOW in a vale beneath a rising hill  Adown which hurries many a plaintive rill  In soft accordance to the murm'ring dove  That morn and evening tells his tale of love  Or in the grove that hangs the brow beside  Sits nestling near his faithful feather'd bride  'Twas there I first with faithless Edward stray'd  'Twas there my eyes my foolish heart betray'd  He saw I lov'dwhich if he had not seen  He had not then so great a tyrant been  Or o'er a heart like mine exulting shewn  That he'd no love for me about his own  Can I forget while near the Medway's side  How oft he call'd me his intended bride  And charm'd me as we trod the banks along  With some soft tale or heartbewitching song  My ear was charm'd I listen'd and believ'd  My love grew stronger as the youth deceiv'd  Who could have thought that falshood ever hung  Mix'd with the lovelike notes of Edward's tongue  Ye banks of Medway witness to his vows  Ye willows too that shaded us with boughs  Ye tides that swell'd and kiss'd the meadow's brim  As if you envy'd me each kiss of him  Come swell again receiving while I weep  My briny tears and mix them with the deep  For Edward's vows are false as subtle sands  That many a fair and gallant vessel strands  My Edward's false and to some other stray'd  And left me wreck'd beneath this willow shade  Let me not live to tyrant love a slave  First let me perish in this wat'ry grave  THE CHICHESTER PACK  AN HUNTING SONG  'TWAS six in the morn and the sky wore a dapplegrey  Cheerly the horn through the village resounds  Old Morpheus now took his leave of my bed  And the vapours of slumber all hastily fled  Say who would not rise when the huntsman cries harkaway  Sluggards to horse and join the sweet hounds  Let urbanical prigs grown feeble by revelling  Come and behold of what pleasure we taste  Each sportsman mounts up on his steed with such grace  While health paints a ruddiness over each face  They all bid defiance to impotent drivelling  Exercise makes the blood vivid and chaste  How pleasant's the sound when the huntsman is hollowing  Near to the skirt of some echoing wood  Each horseman with eagerness joins in the cry  And the glorious clamour resounds to the sky  While stretch'd all along the poor victim lies wallowing  Farmers with pleasure exult in his blood  WILLY OF THE WOODLAND SIDE  SURE Willy will never return back again  I've waited this hour or more  Like the Linnet alas I am left to complain  Which sits on the whins of the moor  My heart it will break with concern  Unless my dear Willy return  Some damsel has stole the dear heart of my swain  And I shall ne'er see my sweet Willy again  The Thrush and the Ouzel are now gone to rest  The Bat and the Owl are awing  The sun hath this hour been sunk in the west  And the sleeplulling nightingales sing  How pensively passes the day  Whenever my Willy's away  Some damsel has stole the clear heart of my swain  And I shall ne'er see my sweet Willy again  WILLIAM OF ALLERTON GREEN  WITH a face full of grief and a heart full of love  Poor William of Allerton Green  In the deepest recess of a neighbouring grove  By Robin the woodman was seen  His looks were intent on a murmuring rill  Which ran o'er the pebbles below  The flood from his eyes serv'd the streamlet to fill  Which sprang from the fountain of woe  His Phaebe he'd miss'd a whole night and a day  They'd promis'd to meet at a wake  He fear'd that some phantom had led her astray  Which dances each night on the lake  But Robin the woodman now langh'd in his sleeve  Who well knew the cause of his tears  And smiling he said I'll your sorrows relieve  And soon put an end to your fears  'Tis true the poor thing had mistaken her way  I met her with grief in each eye  So like a poor sheep that was going astray  She's pounded in safety hard by  Being all over sorrow just like to yourself  And making e'en just such ado  I thought her a foolish young simpering elf  Because she was piping for you  Young William jump'd up all enraptur'd with joy  Said where is my dearest delight  Now Robin cry'd don't you be jealous my boy  With me she has hous'd all the night  Between wife and myself we have kept her from harm  And caution'd her never to roam  You have nothing to do but to lend her your arm  And see the dear creature safe home  GIVE THE FRIENDLESS CHARITY  EDWARD loves me Clara cry'd  But she knew him full of pride  In a beggar's habit dress'd  Put his feelings to the test  As he proudly passed by  She entreated Charity  With a high disdainful look  He but little notice took  Saying do not trouble me  I have nought to do with thee  Still his Clara drew more nigh  Crying sir your Charity  While she spake a gentle gale  Blue aside her humble veil  And expos'd her lovely face  When he slacken'd in his pace  But she still with downcast eye  Cry'd dear sir your Charity  Soon as he her face beheld  All the myst'ry was reveal'd  Saying while he seiz'd her hand  Listen now to my demand  While thus suppliant on my knee  Give thy Edward Charity  Beggar'd he must ever be  Doom'd to endless misery  Clara smiling now reply'd  Seeing she had check'd his pride  All your love dear youth give me  Give the friendless Charity  THE GALLANT LIEUTENANT  PREPARE prepare we're hail'd on board  'Tis fam'd Britannia gives the word  See the gallic bird on high  Turn turn upon your enemy  Be steady hearts be firm and bold  And fight as Briton's fought of old  Then swiftly fly on eagle's wing  To guard your country and your king  The Lion roars within his den  The ancient crest of Englishmen  Undaunted bid you meet the foe  And lay their mighty vaunting low  Be steady hearts c c  Behold the fair Edina stand  Surrounded by her warlike band  And see she draws the hostile blade  To lend her neighbouring sister aid  Be steady hearts c c  Ere yet the battle is begun  Unite ye Britons be as one  Be firm true hearted and sincere  And then oh then you've nought to fear  Be steady hearts c c  ELEANOR OF EXETER  AS wand'ring out one summer's morn  Near Exon's peerless stream  I sought fair Eleanor forlorn  And listen'd to her theme  My heart was soon a pris'ner made  Enchanted were my eyes  My ruddy cheeks began to fade  My bosom heav'd with sighs  But when I heard her Edmund's name  Repeated in each strain  My heart renew'd its wonted flame  My cheeks they flush'd again  The love which modesty forbad  That she should shew to me  The doubts which often made me sad  Were chang'd to exstacy  I ran and knelt at Ellen's feet  She trembl'd all with fear  And tho' she bid me oft retreat  She did it with a tear  I wip'd the precious gem away  And told how much I lov'd  Her eyes shot forth a vivid ray  While she that love approv'd  Then ev'ry morn and ev'ry eve  We pass'd an hour divine  Which caus'd full many a swain to grieve  That Eleanor was mine  When I from church all trim and gay  Led her across the green  Ev'ry swain would whisp'ring say  Would I'd so happy been  EVERY MAN HIS MODE  SURE every man in his way is a prig  From the cut of his coat or the tie of his wig  And most in some partial opinion is bless'd  For every man thinks his own is the best  The Coachman tho' plain is an absolute fop  With his shoulders well squar'd and his head like a mop  Or his broad silver buttons and tripplecap'd coat  And all the slang speeches of Newgate by rote  The Bishop and Dean have a snug kind of cut  With a solemn a sage and monastical strut  The fullpuffed sleeve and the wellstarched band  His wristbands like snow and a lillywhite hand  The Judge is a fop tho' he looks rather droll  With his scarlet and fur and his head like an owl  And the Sergeant as if through the Mohawks he'd bled  Or had lately been scalp'd by the patch on his head  The Quaker's a very queer kind of a quiz  His back so erect and so prim in his phiz  In superfine cloth tho' his coat be but plain  Yet the Quaker's a coxcomb a coxcomb in  grain  The Player's a prigster of every kind  Of every fashion of every mind  Sometimes like a beggar sometimes like a king  A tragical comical whimsical thing  Since men about fashion make such a great pother  And every prig will find fault with his brother  Let each be indulg'd in his different way  For Charmen can tell 'tis the whim of a day  BACCHUS'S ADVICE  OR  THE GOOD EVENING  SINCE all are subject to vexation  While in this state of expectation  For joy is oft alloy'd by sorrow  We laugh today and cry tomorrow  No more with worldly sickness pine  But let your regimen be wine  Let us compound with Time for pleasure  Our days he gives in scanty measure  Slowly oft with grief he crambles  Perplexing with his thorny brambles  'Till Bacchus comes and drives away  The languid vapours of the day  Or if you should in love be pining  And at your mistress' window whining  When she's unheedful of your 'plaining  When all your resolution's waning  Then take a goblet like to mine  And bury all your love in wine  While you are young be not too scanty  When you are old take bumpers plenty  For when we slacken in our paces  And care has wrinkl'd o'er our faces  Wine makes young men often sage  And gives a vigour to old age  Then let us laugh while we are living  There's nothing ever got by grieving  And when the spirit leaves its prison  And to some better state is risen  Good fellows shall in bumpers join  And drink a long farewell in wine  YE BLUSHING RAYS  YE blushing rays of chearing light  Come and dispel the shades of night  The envious night which often tries  To keep enclos'd my Sarah's eyes  Ah gentle maid tho' fair be kind  Come and illume my pensive mind  Darksome appears the brightest place  Whene'er compar'd to Sarah's face  Disclose those eyes of sapphire blue  And brighter far than morning dew  Awake my Sarah make me bless'd  And ease thy Edward's throbbing breast  THE NEGRO'S SOLILOQUY  BY yon bright streamers in the sky  Which glimmer on the sea  The chearing sun approaches nigh  Yet brings no hope to me  The peaceful night yields me no rest  Which gives to others sleep  My heart it bleeds within my breast  My eyes do nought but weep  The toils I cou'd endure of day  Or spurn the tyrant's chain  But Norah's driven far away  Which racks my tortur'd brain  My wife is sheah cruel heart  That cou'd her heart oppress  But 'tis alone the tyrant's part  To triumph o'er distress  Haste blessed tidings haste along  From fair Britannia's isle  All come and ease the anxious throng  And make the slave to smile  If then good hap my Nora lives  These limbs shall ne'er have rest  Until we meet oh then I'll cleave  Forever to her breast  MY LITTLE BLITHSOME SPARROW  WHY turns my Jen her head away  My little blithsome sparrow  That us'd to wanton smile and play  Upon the banks of Yarrow  Sweet her breath as primrose pale  Her waist well shap'd and narrow  And with her smiles she chear'd the dale  And crown'd the banks of Yarrow  Ah what is't makes my Jenny weep  What makes her look aw sorrow  Say has she lost some fav'rite sheep  That fed on bonny Yarrow  Alas alas I sadly fear  The cause of aw this sorrow  She's seen some other swain more dear  Upon the banks of Yarrow  Ah woe is me ah well a day  I see what's caus'd this sorrow  I'll o'er the hills and far away  And think no more of Yarrow  THE PIRATES  TO the restless main we'll bend our sails  A desp'rate trade to try  Nor dread the howling northern gales  Or low'ring of the sky  Since there's no living here on land  Let's scow'r the bounteous sea  On merchant fair or contraband  We'll practice Piracy  On shore some Pirates thieve apace  From precept ev'ry day  To plunder there is no disgrace  When once you've learnt the way  Of tythes the parson trims the farm  Prompt by his rev'rend plea  Then tell me lads where is the harm  In water Piracy  Regraters and forestallers too  Accumulate their store  The world must own this sentence true  They peculate the poor  The lawyer is a name I hate  And all men will agree  They often lop a man's estate  What's that but Piracy  Then who'd be squeamish since our lives  Are all we have to lose  Each man gets bolder as he thrives  And wealth does bliss diffuse  The rogue that's rich ne'er cares a jot  Shou'd he much censur'd be  For 'tis alas each great man's lot  To practice Piracy  CUPID'S ATTRIBUTES  A GLEE  TALK not of books of dress of riches  Talk not of bacchanalian joy  For beauty 'tis which most bewitches  All Nature's govern'd by a boy  At Cupid's touch e'en hero's tremble  To beauty stoics oft submit  And nothing Clara can resemble  Which has not beauty love and wit  A CATCH  Which may be read as the lines follow in the printing or as they are numbered by figures   WHAT makes a modern gentleman   The glory of the nation   To be as simple as he can   A coward in a passion   To keep a wench and starve a wife   The Taylor and the Tonsor   Damme boys but this is life   To have a wife and sconoe her   The world must end as it began   Say is it not the fashion   Wed

Engag'd both fop and clown  Being accosted t'other day  By a clumsy 'squire  Who ask'd her if she knew the way  To quench a raging fire  Pure water sir reply'd the maid  Will quench it in a trice  O no said he you little jade  You give such cold advice  Why then said she 'tis past my skill  To tell you what will do  I'm sure said he you know what will  There's nothing can but you  Alasaday what do you mean  Reply'd the pretty fair  'Tis like a coward to complain  Yo never shou'd despair  Despair I cannot cry'd the 'squire  While you are in my sight  'Tis you must quench the burning fire  You set it first alight  Then straight he clasp'd her round the waist  And forc'd from her a kiss  Ho ho said she is that your taste  Then pray you sir take this  And with a pail plac'd at the door  She sluic'd the amorous 'squire  You're welcome sir to this and more  To quench your raging fire  PLEASURE'S IN THE VALE  WHILE giddy pride from day to day  In quest of pleasure flies  She often turns her head away  Or dazzles with her eyes  Or sometimes in the splendid throng  Where courtly forms appear  She's oft pursu'd the whole night long  But Pleasure's seldom there  Say wou'd you know then where to find  The fair capricious maid  She rests within the humble mind  The cottage or the shade  Or where you hear the nightingale  Sequester'd near some brook  While Cynthia lights the silent vale  There there for Pleasure look  THE POST BOY  I'M a Hounslow young lad and Tidy's my name  Full many a job have I drove  Yet never cross'd nag that was windgall'd or lame  But always had such as would move  A tight pair of buckskins and boots jetty black  My spurs ever polish'd and smart  A trim little jacket to put on my back  Was always the pride of my heart  A good ten miles an hour in common my pace  When leaving behind ev'ry rip  They try to put by but I lead them a chase  And tip 'em the smack of the whip  When oft as I'm driving along in this stile  Thro' many a town as I go  The girls of each inn will bestow me a smile  Their meaning I very well know  Then I find 'em agig whenever I call  And loll at my ease on return  I laugh and I jeer and I talk with 'em all  But Patty's ray only concern  At an inn near to Windsor this little rogue dwells  Well known by her nice winning air  That all other girls of the place she excels  And is call'd pretty Patty the Fair  We have both made a vow should we get the stuff  To marry and so become one  As others have done for 'tis common enough  We'll set up an inn of our own  Then she'll be call'd madam and I'll be call'd sir  We'll stick up the sign of the star  'Mongst post boys and waiters I'll bustle and stir  While Pat hollows loud in the bar  CELIA  A SYMBOLICAL SONG  OFT have I seen at early morn  All tempting to the view  A rosebud on some lofty thorn  Adorn'd with glitt'ring dew  A symbol 'twas of that dear fair  Whose beauties rank'd so high  From mortal reach 'twas planted there  To blush to charm and die  Yet Celia wer't thou fix'd so near  With ev'ry peril round  And should the thorny bushes tear  I'd triumph in each wound  To climb for thee no pains I'd dread  Regardless bear the smart  Nor dread what blood of mine I shed  To get at Celia's heart  THE MAIDEN'S RESOLUTION  I'LL henceforth bear without a sigh  All the secret pangs that grieve me  No more on love will I rely  He smiles on purpose  to deceive me  My Henry vow'd a thousand times  He would never never leave me  The strain of love was in his rhimes  But ah he wrote 'em  to deceive me  He came at eve he came at morn  And begg'd I would of doubts bereave me  Yet now he's left me all forlorn  It was his pastime  to deceive me  The world thank heaven's fair and wide  Time and absence shall relieve me  I'll now assume a maiden's pride  Henry shall no more deceive me  PEG OF THE MOOR  YOUNG Will of the brook did fair Peggy adore  Who liv'd on the skirts of old Bawtery Moor  'Till once at a wake Will was sadly in fear  For she nodded at Tom and at Robin would leer  He said she was false and he bitterly swore  That he'd straight take his leave of Fair Peg of the Moor  She laugh'd and she jeer'd him for what he had spoke  And thought all his saying was nought but a joke  So kept up the frolic her lover to teaze  Until he grew frantic almost by degrees  She meant to have heal'd but she open'd the sore  Which caus'd him to fly from Fair Peg of the Moor  A drum and a fife roar'd aloud in his ears  And forth from the throng a gay serjeant appears  Will vow'd for a soldier he'd instantly go  And so put an end to his lovekindl'd woe  Resolv'd to take leave of the maid evermore  And ne'er again think of Fair Peg of the Moor  To the serjeant he went and he told him his mind  The serjeant was pleas'd and he spoke him so kind  But while he was 'bout with the wag to enlist  Poor Peggy came kneeling and begg'd he'd desist  Ah will you said she leave the lass you adore  Come come and enlist with your Peg of the Moor  His bosom which late with resentment was fill'd  Relax'd of its heat and his heart 'gan to yield  He lifted her up and he kiss'd her with glee  Said since you seem fearful of parting with me  Let the drummer beat up in the morn at my door  And tell that I'm listed to Peg of the Moor  THE GOLDEN EARRING  OR  AUTUMNAL LEAF  GO to the glass dear Bella go  And see what morals you sustain  Can fashion shield the heart from woe  Or palliate a growing pain  While pendant hanging on the ear  The golden bauble charms the eye  An emblem of the waneing year  Say who can tell the year we die  A trifle sometimes yields relief  But shou'd reflection chance to rise  We shudder at the yellow leaf  And fall to  Time  a sacrifice  THE GOOD MERRY FELLOWS ALL UNDER THE HOLLY  Written for the GreenHolly Society under one of those trees while in the Vale of Clnyde in North Wales  LET ne'er a face be melancholy  While underneath this verdant Holly  We must laugh while we can  Since life's but a span  And to yield to old Care's a folly  To repine at one's fate is treason  Since fate has furnish'd us with reason  Let us ever be seen  Like this gay evergreen  In good health throughout the season  When you're warm in conversation  'Twere best avoid prevarication  And when matters grow wrong  Let's strike up a song  And drink to each kind relation  When age with wrinkl'd brow approaches  And hoary Time on strength encroaches  May each wint'ry day  Like the Holly look gay  And our end be without reproaches  EDWARD AND EDITHA  WHEN fair Editha with young Edward sate  Upon a cliff that overlook'd the main  As if intended by some wayward fate  A sudden tempest rose of wind and rain  Which from the dreadful height with fury cast  The beauteous maid adown the frightful steep  Into the green and wide expanded waste  With Thetis there for ever more to sleep  A maniac wild distracted Edward fled  To all he met this piteous burthen said  Say have you seen where e'er you've been  Editha dear my Fairy Queen  Oft o'er the desert wild he'd thoughtless roam  Or where the gloom by clust'ring limes is made  And there bewilder'd make a transient home  Or hold vague converse with Editha's shade  And now he'd sally forth by frenzy led  Or from his cell rush with an hideous scream  Then tear the beauteous ringlets from his head  And seek the margin of some mournful stream  His eyes express'd the tempest in his brain  And thus he sung in slow and pensive strain  Ye Willows green say have ye seen  Editha dear my Fairy Queen  Once where the hurrying torrent rushes down  With thund'ring roar upon the gulph below  While peering rocks above the brambles frown  Like stately monarchs with imperious brow  There while poor Edward sate in abject mood  He thought Editha lav'd upon each wave  Then brav'd the deepest current of the flood  And dy'd like her within a wat'ry grave  But ere he sunk beneath the ruthless tide  Around he look'd and thus he fainting cry'd  Ye Willows green say have ye seen  Editha dear my Fairy Queen  THE LOAVES AND THE FISHES  THE Cooks of our councils great plenty provide  They furnish the tables and then they divide  But if you would know what their fav'rite dish is  'Tis the oldfashion'd food call'd  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about round about round about reel  Since some have but little and some a great deal  Each Patriot prates loud of his country's good  And swears that for charters he'd spill his dear blood  He may talk of his zeal but his principle wish is  To come in at last for  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about c  When a Poor Man is hung'ry he'll make a long face  And should he want fishmeat then give him a place  Let Neptune and Ceres provide to his wishes  The oldfashion'd food call'd  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about c  The Bishop oft prays he translated might be  Or that chance would present him a much better See  If a brother should die the prelate's good wish is  That heaven would send him  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about c  And such is the ease with the kites of the law  When they get a poor client once into their claw  Should a Judge slip his wind the first legal wish is  That they may be  bench'd  near  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about c  The great men  in  place are for raising the crown  And those that are  out  are for pulling it down  The party on both sides have  self  in their wishes  And all things give way to  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about c  May heaven soon grant that we all have a meal  Save those who pretend that they're chuck full of zeal  For those who are full must relinquish their wishes  When they cannot make room for  the Loaves and the Fishes  CHORUS  Then round about round about round about reel  Since some have but little and some a great deal  SPRINGWATER CRESSES  WHEN hoary frost hung on each thorn  Ere night had well withdrawn her gloom  Poor Phoebe went one wint'ry morn  From Colnbrookdown to Langlybroom  When from the brake or from the rill  Half clad and with neglected tresses  Her rushy basket try'd to fill  With fresh and green SPRINGWATER CRESSES  Yet many a chearful strain she'd sing  While wading thro' the chilling stream  Her thoughtless spirits were a wing  With love or with some jocund theme  Then with her humble merchandize  In hopes to conquer her distresses  Away to London next she hies  And cries her YOUNG SPRINGWATER CRESSES  Thro' many an alley lane or street  Ere luxury has left her bed  You're sure poor Phoebe next to meet  Trying to get her daily bread  The wind and rain she oft defies  When e'er her purse some mite possesses  With chearful voice she daily cries  Come buy my YOUNG SPRINGWATER CRESSES  PITY KINDLED INTO LOVE  IN spite of what my tongue can say  Celia's deaf to all persuasion  Cold seems her heart as earthly clay  When love's my theme she's all evasion  Why did the gods impress my mind  Or raise such ardour in my breast  And yet the fair be so unkind  To triumph o'er a heart distress'd  Say why thou cherubdimpl'd boy  Hast thou fetter'd my affection  Or why with frowns my peace destroy  And leave me wilder'd by distraction  Ah wou'd you Celia were I laid  Quite breathless in the silent grave  Wou'd you not then dear cruel maid  In pity once your bosom heave  Fair Celia listen'd to his strain  With a heartfelt strange obtrusion  When Pity rais'd a gentle flame  Which kindl'd into soft delusion  Love fann'd the blaze with magic breath  And made her own the genial heat  No more no more dear youth of death  Or vainly kneel at Celia's feet  The nymph these words so sweetly said  Strephon was with joy confounded  Quickly he rear'd his drooping head  And like the hart elate he bounded  He seiz'd her hand and bless'd her tongue  And smil'd with joy at her decree  Said through the plains let it be sung  That Celia owns her love for me  WHAT IS LIBERTY  OLD Johnny Bull the other day  Came to me across the way  Said neighbour tell me tell me pray  What is Liberty  I instantly reply'd sir  'Tis rushing like a tide sir  Good order to deride sir  That is Liberty  'Tis trying without reason sir  To propagate high treason sir  Or cut a brother's wheezen sir  That is Liberty  To knock your neighbour down sir  If ever it were known sir  That he possess'd a crown sir  That is Liberty  To set up guillotines sir  To murder kings and queens sir  And all such pretty scenes sir  That is Liberty  To pull down church and state sir  At any kind of rate sir  Or knock you o'er the pate sir  That is Liberty  To make mankind a clod sir  And what is very odd sir  Acknowledging no God sir  That is Liberty  John said the times are bad sir  The folks are surely mad sir  For making such a sad stir  If that be Liberty  CLODY AND CLARA OR LOVE'S CONTROVERSY  CLODY  IS it because I love you more  Than ever mortal lov'd before  Is it your sport to use me so  Will you not marry Clara  CLARA  No  Why will you teaze me ev'ry day  When I've so often said you nay  Have I not daily bid you go  Prithee now leave me Clody  CLODY  No  Wou'd you then see poor Clody die  Rather than with his suit comply  Have you no feelings for my woe  When I so dearly love you  CLARA  No  Were you in love all day to pine  And at my door all night to whine  My heart wou'd still the harder grow  Now will you follow Clara  CLODY  No  Since you're so savage and unkind  I'll try some other maid to find  But none shall ever treat me so  For Clara has discharg'd me  CLARA  No  I hope my Clody does but rave  Have I not been thy loving slave  I did but joke pray do not go  Will you not Clara marry  CLODY  No  You've teaz'd the humble mouse too long  You've done your faithful Clody wrong  Now to the winds your love I'll blow  And heed no more your  yes  or  no  CLARA  Prithee my Clody do not go  CLODY  Have you not said too often no  CLARA  Are you not joking sure you are  CLODY  Have you not borne the joke too far  CLARA  But I will never more do so  Say will you not believe me  CLODY  No  MY OWN FIRESIDE  KIT CUMILE talks of his highfashion'd joys  Of each trifle he speaks with delight  His hours each day with his horse he employs  And his bottle and mistress at night  Give me the delights that will cherish the mind  Dup'd neither by folly or pride  A wife that is friendly that's loving and kind  On my knee by my own fire side  The overgrown cit that has throve by the gripe  Distressing his neighbours around  Would gladly his sins puff away with his pipe  Or tries them in liquor to drown'd  On his riches he fain wou'd eternity raise  But Time clips the wings of his pride  Give me that eternal that genial blaze  That glows by my own fireside  Let princes for honor contend in the wars  And the statesman for profit or place  Astrologers wander about in the stars  Or my lord break his neck in the chace  Such pleasures are transient and dangerous all  'Tis a truth that can ne'er be deny'd  I sit at my ease should they rise should they fall  And regale by my own fireside  AN OLD FRIEND WITH A NEW FACE  OF friendship men often will boast to each other  For we all are consider'd as sister or brother  Life's a meer masquerade and 'tis often the case  That you'll meet an old friend  that shall wear a new face  You shall sit at the board where the toasts freely pass  And good sentiments given on filling each glass  But meet the next morning and often you'll trace  That your overnight friend  has put on a new face  If you've e'er been connected with placemen or trade  When your word or your vote would have yielded them aid  Though your hand might be squeez'd by old Grub or his Grace  When their ends are once serv'd  they will shew a new face  Should Fortune by chance throw a purse in your way  What a many fine things will each flatterer say  Should she once turn her back you shall sink in disgrace  And the devil a friend but  will wear a new face  Then let each worthy fellow take care of himself  And keep a few comforts in store on his shelf  Yet be not a niggard with prudence keep pace  And despise that old friend  that shall wear a new face  THE RESPONSIVE DOVE  YOUNG Phillis overnight had been  To dance upon the rural green  And while she mingl'd with the swains  Assembl'd from the neighb'ring plains  The envy'd partner which she chose  Was Thyrsis first of village beaus  As accidents oft come by chance  They both were wounded in the dance  Each found within the troubl'd breast  A pain that would not let them rest  She to the wood sequester'd stray'd  And in the gloomy shelt'ring shade  Said to herself in accents low  What can it be disturbs me so  When o'er her head a list'ning dove  Responsive cry'dfair maid 'tis love  When Thyrsis heard she'd left her home  Resolv'd with hasty steps to roam  And with an ardent lover's faith  He sought each wood's remotest path  Until he found his Phillis dear  Who wond'ring cry'dWhat brought you here  When straight reply'd the pensive dove  What should it be fair maid but love  I THOUGHT IT WAS QUEER  AS I lean'd o'er a gate one Midsummer's eve  When the sky in the brook look'd so clear  Young Robin came slily and tugg'd at my sleeve  And I could not help  thinking it queer  He patted my cheek and he play'd with my hand  And he gave such a whimsical leer  Then talk'd about things I could scarce understand  That I could not  help thinking it queer  Now all of a sudden he let his thoughts loose  And he ask'd if to church I would steer  I thought him a whimsical madheaded goose  For his talking  of matters so queer  I meant to have chid him for what he had said  When he whisper'd so soft in my ear  That if I had check'd him my heart would have bled  For it panted and  flutter'd so queer  How long have you lov'd me pray Robin said I  When he answer'd "a calendar year"  I then was resolv'd with his suit to comply  Although it  seemed hasty and queer  Folks thought it so odd that an hour or so  Should have made me so ready appear  But many a lass who have answer'd with  no  Have died  like old maidens so queer  LOVE AND TIME  JOHN met with Peg the other day  As she to church was walking  And as he had a deal to say  He straight began a talking  He ask'd her if her heart was free  Or if she him approv'd  And all the while could plainly see  Her snowy bosom mov'd  His heart was yet 'tween hope and fear  And strove his doubts to smother  Unless those heavings of his dear  Might move thus for another  Awhile she blush'd and now she smil'd  Cry'd prithee be not simple  Yet love the more his heart beguil'd  And sported in each dimple  She thought he talk'd too soon of love  'Twas time enough for wooing  He told her Time did swiftly move  And Time was Love's undoing  Peg then reply'd if that's the case  'Tis time that we were moving  And said with sadness in her face  He sure wont kill for loving  Why then cry'd John let's haste to church  And all our fears deliver  Old Time shall linger in the lurch  And Love shall live for ever  Away they wentmade most of Time  In spite of all his flurry  Love saw they both were in their prime  So bound them in a hurry  THE ROYAL COTTAGER  WHEN e'er I think on that dear spot  On which I fix'd my rural cot  Then when my rose hung on my arm  All free from guile and free from harm  My days they glided on with glee  And all things then were well with me  But when once drawn away by fate  Unto a more exalted state  By smiling fortune promis'd fair  Until she brought her train of care  'Twas then I first began to see  That happiness had fled from me  The noise of cities glare of courts  Where gay dissimulation sports  Where envy fain wou'd blight my Rose  Because her cheek so purely glows  Let fortune take her stores again  Give me my cot and rural plain  And while I tread the ocean's side  The greatest pleasure greatest pride  Shall be each day with Rose to walk  In social inoffensive talk  And when each blissful day shall close  The waves shall lull us to repose  POLL OF PRESTBURY  ON a rural village green  Where the rustic sports are seen  When the lads and lasses play  At the close of summer's day  There young William chanc'd to see  Pretty Poll of Prestbury  If she tripp'd the turf along  If she warbl'd out a song  William seem'd to shew surprize  In his loveenraptur'd eyes  Said how happy he cou'd be  With sweet Poll of Prestbury  Oft he fidl'd near her side  Asking her to be his bride  She wou'd turn her head away  Telling him she'd nought to say  William cry'd ah turn to me  Pretty Poll of Prestbury  Bashfully she rais'd her head  And these words in pity said  " William you are come too late  " To be Allen's is my fate"  Cruel fate replied he  Adieu sweet Poll of Prestbury  Thou wert once my hope and pride  All the world was nought beside  Now each hope is fled away  Leaving me to love a prey  To pine to weep to think on thee  My pretty Poll of Prestbury  THE RATIONALS  THE viands clear'd let nought be heard  But jollity and fun  And while we sit let's call in wit  She'll treat us with a pun  Good wine you know makes wit to flow  Along in full career  But let your wit be always fit  To meet a sage's ear  For shou'd you dash your thoughts with trash  Or smuttily besmear  We'll make you drink twice to the brink  To wash your senses clear  Your lasses toast but make no boast  Lest envy shou'd appear  Some wag that's by perhaps may try  Her blazon'd charms to share  They are not wise who riches prize  And tell where they are laid  And he's the same that boasts the fame  Of his betrothed maid  Then let's be blithe lest with his scythe  Old Time upon his stumps  Shou'd come and see we wanted glee  And take us in the dumps  FINIS  W DYDE PRINTER TEWKESBURY
