 The BEAUTIES OF Hume AND BOLINGBROKE  LONDON Printed for G Kearsly in Fleet Street Price Half a Crown    PREFACE  THE Book here presented to the Public is compiled from two of the most singular and illustrious philosophers that ever flourished in this part of the world It has been their fate with other great and good men in all ages to incur the deepest obloquy even in the instant of conferring on mankind the most lasting and extensive benefits Their works however will endure as long as the language and their names be recorded with honour while the history of  Britain  continues to interest posterity  The private characters of  Hume  and  Bolingbroke  exhibit nothing strikingly similar except their attachment to study and eager pursuit of literary Fame The manners of the one were simple plain amiable and engaging those of the other rather stotely often assuming and uniformly refined The youth as well as manhood of the first was spent under every circumstance in which fortune placed him in a sedulous and single attention to the cultivation and improvement of his literary talents that of the second apparently without any view whatever and in scenes of the most exceptionable dissipation  Hume  maintained through life an unsullied reputation for every species of virtue and worth In company or out of it abroad or at home his goodnature never forsook him His temper was generally unruffled even while the petulance of his pious persecutors exposed him to the rudest insult and he has been known to revise with exemplary candour the foulest libels presented to him under the name of Answers to some parts of his writings The very poor in his neighbourhood though instigated by priestcraft to revile and execrate his opinions  regarded his benevolence and humanity with a mixture of reverence and gratitude His deportment on every occasion while eminently chaste and manly was altogether the reverse of pomp or ostentation Peculiarly affable and easy of access he discovered nothing of the scholar either in his appearance or conversation and all his attentions being the spontaneous effusions of genuine philanthropy were without ceremony or parade While his talents were vigorously exerted to overturn the system his morals would have adorned the purest and most primitive ages of Christianity And he was neither wanting in that extraordinary strength of mind nor in that singular goodness of heart which in every country and period of human story have always distinguished the greatest and the best of men  To this high degree of excellence in the first distinctions of humanity  Bolingbroke  had no claim The sublimest theory of virtue which his exalted genius could either conceive or recommend had yet but little influence on the management of his passions He was not a speculative only but a practical libertine Stationed for a great number of years and during some of the most important periods of our history in the giddy vortex of public life he was evidently too deeply engrossed and agitated to be much susceptible of those tender endearments which for the most part prompt and accompany the exercise of private and domestic virtue But towards the evening of his days in a situation not a little solitary and romantic his elevated and enlightened mind assumed a gravity and repose suitable to that majestic and commanding tone which had ever characterised its greatest exertions It was then only one of his fondest admirers  Lord  Orrery  remarks of him that he united in conversation the wisdom of  Socrates  with the ardour of  Plato  the dignity and ease of  Pliny  with the wit and sprightliness of  Horace  Different as the talents in writing of these eminent authors certainly were the many bright specimens of their taste and  genius now in possession of the public discover a few points at least in which there is still a very striking likeness The infinite and irreparable mischief done to society by an affectation of religion where the reality of it was wanting betrayed each of them into a most implacable and unwarrantable aversion to whatever bears the name and under the obnoxious masque of bigotry the most sacred feelings and regards of mankind are treated with due respect by neither Still a rich and shining variety of beautiful and interesting passages in the vicinity of many very exceptionable ones in both have for this reason been long lost to those especially on whom they were likely to produce the best effects And the design of this little volume is to extract from a huge collection of such gross materials some of the purest ore to enlist on the side of Virtue the greatest advocates for Infidelity and to despoil Vice of those meretricious weapons by which she has done most execution  Bolingbroke  's genius was bold picturesque splendid and oratorical that of  Hume  seemed more acute concise and penetrating The one is distinguished by a lofty and daring imagination by an inexhaustible brilliancy of ideas and by a diction peculiarly expressive and tropical the other by a clear and subtil understanding by deep and accurate thinking and by a style uniformly easy emphatical and elegant The conceptions of the first were so strong and ardent that he grasped at Truth by a kind of intuitive violence without stooping to any of those slow and intermediate means by which she condescends to become accessible to more ordinary minds the second possessed all the powers of investigation in such perfection as induced him to spare no pains in the discovery of this important object by the humble and dispassionate but certain mode of reasoning History and metaphysics were the favourite and most successful study of  Hume Bolingbroke's  letters on the first are among the most finished of his productions but he never lost himself so completely as when he plunged into the bottomless abyss of the second  Both of these two celebrated writers have investigated in a masterly manner the multifarious science of politics Their ideas however in a great variety of the first and most important particulars are essentially different The reasonings of  Hume  on all those popular and constitutional questions which have been lately so repeatedly and so tenaciously debated in the  British  senate like his History may be considered as a most ingenious and elegant apology for prerogative His uncommon talents are perpetually occupied and not without success in relaxing the general attachments of mankind to the important blessings of liberty in reconciling them to every possible modification of government in suppressing their sentiments of independence and in suggesting new arguments for submission and obedience The opinions of  Bolingbroke  are not only more open and decided but uniformly on the side of freedom and the rights of the subject as settled at the Revolution On this delicate and interesting subject his productions are to this day without a parallel Politics seem his own peculiar province in which notwithstanding his numerous compeers he still reigns unrivalled His  Dissertation on Parties  and  Idea of a Patriot King  are more replete than any thing else in the language with a series of observations and reasonings concerning the distinct privileges of prince and people equally pertinent original and persuasive No where the dupe of those chimerical illusions and conjectures which confound the shallow and amuse the speculative the general principles on which his particular conclusions are built have all a sold and permanent foundation in fact and the nature of things His sole and exclusive aim is to graft the theory of the  British  constitution on ancient usage and to reduce it to present practice  This system so lately and ably revived by his Grace the Duke of  Richmond  is an obvious improvement by our noble author on that which chiefly produced the Revolution As it does honour to his genius it could not have found a better advocate He evidently writes from the heart and whatever he  says affects his readers with a forcible emphasis and propriety His conceptions always formed with judgment and taste are every where delivered with earnestness and energy The dignified manner in which he reprobates all those selfish and accommodating principles or maxims which keep most public men in an infamous kind of equiposse between honour and interest peculiarly becomes him It is the genuine but indignant language of virtue spurn  ng the insidious approaches of vice under the most qualified and deceitful appearances In one word he treats the whole science of government as proceeding regularly only when actuated by the great mastersprings of right and wrong This is the keystone or first principle of all his politics and to this not like  Hume  to the manners of the age and the depravity of human nature he directed all his arguments and made all his appeals  In the following selection an equal attention is paid to the morals of  Hume  and the politics of  Bolingbroke  We have enough in all conscience of that sophistry and re  inement in which the last was so great a master He perhaps without intending has made it the cant of the day to sneer avowedly at whatever bears the semblance of principle in public life The people of  England  happily feel and even begin at last to resent the pernicious consequences of this most profligate and temporizing system  Bolingbroke  's notions on all points of present political altercation or enquiry are literally theirs The substance of what he thought and wrote on whatever is most valuable and interesting in the  British  constitution is here combined and exhibited And to say the least that can be said it is surely one of the most inestimable legacies that ever a statesman bequeathed to his country  THE LIFE OF DAVID HUME Esq  MAN is constituted by nature and moulded by habit so mechanically that every individual may be said to differ from another as essentially in the biass of his mind and the temperature of his heart as in the features of his face Whatever makes this distinction is that fixed and governing principle by which character is formed and estimated  A passion for literature runs visibly through the whole of  Hume  's life and gives a colouring to all his actions Here all his wishes terminated and to accomplish distinction in this exclusive line every other view or prospect of ambition was sacrificed Nor does he owe more of his success to uncommon ability and address perhaps than to his steady ardent and unremitted pursuit of one great and interesting concern This at least clearly accounts for all that attachment to paradox and pyrrhonism which so singularly characterise his metaphysical writings  His parents were descended of a good family and independent though not wealthy He was born at  Edinburgh  the th of  April  old style His patrimony was but trifling as he was only a younger brother  That predilection for study which never forsook him discovered itself at an early period This with his habits of industry and application disposed his friends to six on the law as a proper profession for him But he owns while they thought him poring on  Vo  t  and  Vinnius  he was secretly devouring  Cicero  and  Virgil  Impelled however by the narrowness of his fortune he thought of seriously attaching himself to business For this purpose he went to  Bristol  but preferring retirement and books to every other pursuit and prospect he soon left  Bristol  and repaired to  France  where he could live at less expence and prosecute his literary views with equal advantage  Partly at  Rheims  but chiefly at  La Flêche  in  Anjou  he composed his  Treatise of Human Nature  There he resided near three years and published this work shortly after his return to  England  But to use his own phrase it  fell deadborn from the press  He was more fortunate in the first part of his  Essays  which appeared originally at  Edinburgh  in It is remarkable that about this time though somewhat turned of thirty he recovered his knowledge of the  Greek  language which he had almost lost through negligence  He went in to live with the Marquis of  Annandale  in  England  on special invitation and having undertook the tuition of that nobleman's son he continued in this situation for a twelvemonth  As secretary to General  St Clair  he attended in an expedition on the coast of  France  and afterwards accompanied him in his embassy to the courts of  Vienna  and  Turin  The two years in which he was thus employed were almost the only interruption his general studies ever received It was now he republished his first performance under a new form but it succeeded little better than before  Notwithstanding this disappointment his fertile mind still teemed with fresh literary adventures The scenes he had lately reviewed in his official capacity probably opened to him a variety of original speculations and some of his former publications gaining on the public estimation he was encouraged in to bring forth his  Political Discourses  which had a most rapid sale  Soon after appeared his  Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals  which in his own opinion is of all his writings incomparably the best  His next performance was the  History of England  which he commenced with the accession of the House of  Stuart  to the sovereignty of  Britain  This work cost him great pains and gave him much hope It was received however so coolly that he scarcely heard of one man in the three kingdoms considerable for rank or letters that could endure it The two Primates of  England  and  Ireland  were indeed exceptions odd enough who sent him separate messages not to be discouraged But it was then perhaps as now when courtcreepers or sticklers for prerogative are the most likely to succeed in the line of ecclesiastical preferment This disappointment had almost got the better of his resolution and a war which at that time subsisted between  France  and  England  was the only thing that kept him from going into voluntary banishment To this accidental circumstance we owe his completion of the most finished and classical History this or any other country ever produced  The Natural History of Religion  was now published This gave a serious alarm to the religious sentiments of his countrymen Many indirect attacks were made on it and it brought on the author all the illiberal petulance arrogance and scurrility of the  Warburtonian  school  Two years subsequent to the fall of the first came out the second volume of his History which brought it down from the death of  Charles  I to the Revolution This made him some amends for his other literary miscarriages it was a popular performance and not only raised the character of the author but rendered the former volume of some request  His account of the House of  Tudor  was not published till and was then regarded with dislike especially in  England  This however did not deter him from finishing in two volumes the more early periods of the  British  story which he gave to the public in with tolerable and but tolerable success  He was then invited to attend the Earl of  Hertford  on his embassy to  Paris  which after some hesitation and reluctance he thought proper to accept He speaks with much satisfaction of the pleasure he received from the connexions to which this appointment introduced him  The present Commander in Chief being appointed one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State in our author was made UnderSecretary In this department he continued for near two years and went out with the then Ministry  He now possessed a thousand pounds of yearly revenue and returned to  Edinburgh  with the fond hopes of long enjoying at his leisure and among his friends the honourable rewards of his great talents and great industry  In about half a dozen years he was seized however with a disorder in his bowels which at first gave him no alarm but which soon became incurable He did not die till several months after having given up all hopes of life He suffered but little pain and retained his faculties and spirits to the very last  He pronounces his own oulogium in a manner that shews how well he deserved it We insert it in this place as none of the least beautiful passages in his works  "I was a man of mild disposition of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humour capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions Even my love of literary fame my ruling passion never soured my temper notwithstanding my frequent disappointments My company was not unacceptable to the young and  areless as well as to the studious and literary and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them In a word though most men any wise eminent have found reason to complain of Calumny I never was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wanted fury My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots we may well suppose would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but I hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained"  The same experimental mode of philosophizing which the great  Bacon  recommends and which had been so successfully applied by  Locke  to metaphysics and by  Newton  to physical phaenomena our author uniformly adopts in all his disquisitions on morals and human nature It is in this systematic and rational use of facts his chief excellence as an author and philosopher lies Perhaps it may be said of him what  Pope  said of  Bolingbroke If ever he trifies it may be when he turns Divine  Many have lamented much that ever his great abilities produced any thing inimical to Christianity It afforded however one very important example of decency and command of temper to all her friends and apologists For whatever obligations she may have to many of their labours she has none to some dispositions discovered in her behalf  Our author began his literary career with a resolution which he inflexibly maintained through life never to reply to any body and not being very irascible in his temper he easily kept clear of all literary squabbles The unmanly sarcasms even of a  Beattie  the most illiberal and virulent of all his antagonists never extorted from him a single invective He regarded his furious declamation only as so much froth which he well knew would subside and be forgotten the moment the vapour that produced it vanished  About this time a quarto edition of his  Essays  was published in two volumes to one of which the following Advertisement was prefixed  "Most of the principles and reasonings contained in this volume were published in a work in three volumes intitled  A Treatise of Human Nature  a work which the author had projected before he left college and which he wrote and published not long after but not finding it successful he was sensible of his error in going to the press too early and he cast the whole anew in the following pieces where some negligences in his former reasoning and more in  the expression are he hopes corrected Yet several writers who have honoured the author's philosophy with answers have taken care to direct all their batteries against that juvenile work which the author never acknowledged and have affected to triumph in any advantages which they imagined they had obtained over it a practice very contrary to all rules of candour and fair dealing and a strong instance of those polemical artifices which a bigoted zeal thinks itself authorised to employ"  This Life we shall conclude with a Note occasioned by a Reply to his Essay on the  Populousness of ancient Nations  This Reply was written by a late eminent Divine of the church of  Scotland  who discovered on this as on all other occasions such a manly attention to truth as precluded the impertinent interference of every other passion Our author takes notice of this respectful answer in a manner equally honourable to both The Note is preserved in none of the later editions of his works  "AN ingenious writer has honoured this discourse with an answer full of politeness erudition and goodsense So learned a refutation would have made the author suspect that his reasonings were entirely overthrown had he not used the precaution from the beginning to keep himself on the sceptical side and having taken this advantage of the ground he was enabled though with much inferior forces to preserve himself from a total defeat That Reverend Gentleman will always find where his antagonist is so entrenched that it will be difficult to force him  Varro  in such a situation could defend himself against  Hannibal Pharnaces  against  Caesar  The author very willingly acknowledges that his antagonist has detected many mistakes in his authorities and reasonings and it was owing entirely to that Gentleman's indulgence that many more errors were not remarked In this edition advantage has been taken of his learned animadversions and the Essay has been rendered less imperfect than formerly"  THE LIFE OF HENRY ST JOHN LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE  HENRY ST JOHN  Lord Viscount  Bolingbroke  was born in the year at  Battersea  in  Surry  at a seat that had been in the possession of his ancestors for ages before His family was of the first rank equally conspicuous for its antiquity dignity and large possessions It is found to trace its original as high as  Adam de Port  Baron of  Basing  in  Hampshire  before the Conquest and in a succession of ages to have produced warrio  s patriots and statesmen some of whom were conspicuous for their loyalty and others for their defending the rights of the people His grandfather Sir  Walter St John  of  Battersea  marrying one of the daughters of Lord Chief Justice  St John  who as all know was strongly attached to the Republican party  Henry  the subject of the present memoir was brought up in his family and consequently imbibed the first principles of his education amongst the Dissenters  Nature seemed not less kind to him in her external embellishments than in adorning his mind With the graces of an handsome person and a face in which dignity was happily blended with sweetness he had a manner of address that was  very engaging His vivacity was always awake his apprehension was quick his wit refined and his memory amazing his subtilty in thinking and reasoning was profound and all these talents were adorned with an elocution that was irresistible  To the assemblage of so many gifts from Nature it was expected that Art would soon give her finishing hand and that a youth begun in excellence would soon arrive at perfection but such is the perverseness of human nature that an age which should have been employed in the acquisition of knowledge was dissipated in pleasure and instead of aiming to excel in praiseworthy pursuits  Bolingbroke  seemed more ambitious of being thought the greatest rake about town  In this mad career of pleasure he continued for some time but at length in when he arrived at the twentyeighth year of his age he began to take a dislike to his method of living and to find that sensual pleasure alone was not sufficient to make the happiness of a reasonable creature He therefore made his first effort to break from his state of infatuation by marrying the daughter and coheiress of Sir  Henry Winchescomb  a descendant from the famous  Jack  of  Newbury  who though but a clothier in the reign of  Henry  VIII was able to entertain the King and all his retinue in the most splendid manner This Lady was possessed of a fortune exceeding forty thousand pounds and was not deficient in mental accomplishments but whether he was not yet fully satiated with his former pleasures or whether her temper was not conformable to his own it is certain they were far from living happily together After cohabiting for some time together they parted by mutual consent both equally displeased he complaining of the obstinacy of her temper she of the shamelessness of his infidelity A great part of her fortune some time after upon his attainder was given her back but as her family estates were settled upon him he enjoyed them after her death upon the reversal of his attainder  It is impossible to do justice to the public life of this great man without giving a particular detail of politics for a great number of years His eloquence abilities and influence soon brought him forward in the service of his country The latter end of Queen  Anne  's reign seems the period in which of all others his capacity as a statesman and minister shone with the greatest lustre That critical juncture called for the exertion of all his eminent qualities and it is agreed that he managed the contending factions which then divided the nation a most expensive continental war an intriguing court and a fickle Queen with an address and success equally exquisite and unexpected  While thus industriously employed he was not without the rewards that deserved to follow such abilities joined to so much assiduity In  July  he was created Baron  St John  of  Lidyard Tregoze  in  Wittshire  and Viscount  Bolingbroke  by the last of which titles he is now generally known and is likely to be talked of by posterity He was also the same year appointed LordLieutenant of the county of  Essex  By the titles of  Tregoze  and  Bolingbroke  he united the honours of the elder and younger branch of his family and thus transmitted into one channel the opposing interests of two races that had been distinguished one for their loyalty to King  Charles  I the other for their attachment to the Parliament that opposed him It was afterwards his boast that he steered clear of the extremes for which his ancestors had been distinguished having kept the spirit of freedom of the one and acknowledged the subordination that distinguished the other  His quarrel with  Oxford  whom he despised exposed both to the most imminent destruction So noble a mind was above harbouring groundless resentments but no concessions could reconcile him to the base or worthless  On the accession of  George  the First he shared the ruin of his party and as one of their leaders accumulated most of  the odium their measures had incurred The revenge of his enemies who had now wriggled themselves into power made it unsafe for him to stay longer in  England  Immediately on his departure for  France  a bill of attainder was preferred against him  It was now partly from resentment and disgust and partly from a strong predilection for the bustle of office but chiefly to gratify his boundless ambition that he joined the Pretender But in this new service he found every thing so very mean and mortifying that he never appeared hearty in the business Nor was he treated with that confidence and cordiality to which he thought the sacrifices he made and his conscious ability justly intitled him It was his aim always to be foremost in every administration and he could not bear to act as a subaltern in so paltry a court as that of the Pretender Within less than a twelvemonth he was therefore dismissed and even served with a mock impeachment by his new master  This fortunate accident awakened all his sensibility and made him long more than ever for a participation of those liberties the malice of his persecutors had tempted him to forfeit To the intrigues of the court perhaps more than to the interference of friends or any other cause he owed the accomplishment of this desirable event During this interval notwithstanding the painful suspense in which we must suppose him he wrote  Reflections on Exile  one of the most masterly the most elegant and the most affecting moral compositions in our language  His first Lady with whom he had not cohabited for years being now dead he married a second time and on his return to  England  devoted his time entirely to a country life the charms of philosophy and domestic happiness  Obscurity however was not his element While his friends thought him reconciled to his fate he secretly sighed to emerge anew in a public capacity But the minister of the day dreaded his abilities and virtues He petitioned the House of Commons to be reinstated in his former emoluments and capacities but the cabals of the cabinet defeated his wishes This instigated him to take part with  Pultney  in his opposition to  Walpole  The last engaged to manage the House of Commons and the first to open the eyes of the people  This great political controversy lasted ten years in the course of which our noble author elucidated all the beauties and excellencies of the  British  constitution with singular elegance and perspicuity His system of politics is certainly the most complete and satisfactory of any in the language Happily for this country it is now popular and predominant And in our excerpts from his writings respect has been chiefly had to those leading ideas of ministers government and the constitution which coincide most with the general sentiments of the nation on these subjects  Disgusted with all parties and apparently tired of every pursuit he once more took leave of  England  and retired to  France  But even in solitude his hours did not glide away in torpid inactivity Having no further chance of ruling his cotemporaries he revolved on securing the applaute and gratitude of posterity This laudable object he pursued with dignity and success in a course of  Letters on the Study of History  which exhibit the delica of his taste the energy of his mind and the sensibility of his heart in the most amiable and useful point of view  It was here too that in a Letter addressed to Lord  Bathurst  he apologizes for his attachment to retirement and study This Letter like all his political writings discovers much political discernment and has what is wanting in most of them great moderation and some fine morality  Yet still amidst his resolutions to turn himself from politics and to give himself up entirely to the ca  s of philosophy he could not resist embarking once more in the debates of his country and coming back from  France  settled as  Battersea  an old seat which was his father's and had been long in the possession of the family He supposed he saw an impending calamity and thought it was not in his power to remove he thought it his duty to retard its fall To redeem or save the nation from perdition he thought impossible since national corruptions were to be purged by national calamities but he was  e  olved to send his feeble assistance to item the torrent that was pouring in With this spirit he wrote that excellent piece which is intit  ed  The Idea of a Patriot King  in which he describes a Monarch uninfluenced by party leaning to the suggestions neither of Whigs no  Tories but equally the friend and father of all Some time after in the year after the conclusion of the peace two years before the measures taken by the administration seemed not to have been repugnant to his notions of political prudence for that juncture in that year he wrote his last production containing Reflections on the then State of the Nation principally with regard to her Taxes and Debts and on the Causes and Consequences of them This undertaking was left unfinished for Death snatched the pen from the hand of the writer  Having passed the latter part of his life in dignity and splendour his rational faculties improved by reflection and his ambition kept under by disappointment his whole aim seemed to have been to leave the stage of life on which he had acted such various parts with applause He had long withed to fetch his last breath at  Battersea  the place whe  e he was born and Fortune that had through life seemed to traverse all his aims at last indulged him in this He had long been troubled with a cancer in his cheek by which excruciating disease he died on the verge of fourscore years of age He was consonant with himself to the last and those principles which he had all along  avowed he confirmed with his dying breath having given orders that none of the clergy should be permitted to trouble him in his latest moments  In this manner lived and died Lord  Bolingbroke  ever active never depressed ever pursuing Fortune and as constantly disappointed by her In whatever light we view his character we shall find him an object rather proper for our wonder than our imitation more to be feared than esteemed and gaining our admiration without our love His ambition ever aimed at the summit of power and nothing seemed capable of satisfying his immoderate desires but the liberty of governing all things without a rival With as much ambition as great abilities and more acquired knowledge than  Caesar  he wanted only his courage to be as successful but the schemes his head dictated his heart often refused to execute and he lost the ability to perform just when the great occasion called for all his efforts to engage  The same ambition that prompted him to be a politician actuated him as a philosopher His aims were equally great and extensive in both capacities Unwilling to submit to any power in the one or any authority in the other he entered the fields of science with a thorough contempt of all that had been established before him and seemed to think every thing wrong that he might shew his faculty in the reformation It might have been better for his quiet as a man if he had been content to act a subordinate character in the state and it had certainly been better for his memory as a writer if he had aimed at doing less than he attempted Wisdom in morals like every other art or science is an accumulation that numbers have contributed to increase and it is not for one single man to pretend that he can add more to the heap than the thousands that have gone before him Such innovators more frequently retard than promote knowledge their maxims are more agreeable to the reader by having the gloss of novelty to recommend them  than those which are trite only because they are true Such men are therefore followed at first with avidity nor is it till some time that their disciples begin to find their error They often though too late perceive that they have been following a speculative enquiry while they have been leaving a practical good and while they have been practising the arts of doubting they have been losing all firmness of principle which might tend to establish the rectitude of their private conduct As a moralist therefore Lord  Bolingbroke  by having endeavoured at too much seems to have done nothing but as a political writer few can equal and none can exceed him As he was a practical posicician his writings are less filled with those speculative illusions which are the result of solitude and seclusion He wrote them with a certainty of their being opposed sifted examined and reviled he therefore took care to build them up of such materials as could not be easily overthrown they prevailed at the times in which they were written they still continue to be the admiration of the present age and will probably last for ever  CONTENTS  REFERENCES being omitted in compiling the body

of Dr DODD  ⁂The BEAUTIES of POPE are in the Press likewise  THE BEAUTIES OF HUME  THE GOLDEN AGE  THE seasons in this first period of nature were so temperate that there was no necessity for men to provide themselves with clothes and houses as a security against the violence of heat and cold The rivers flowed with wine and milk The oaks yielded honey and nature spontaneously produced her greatest delicacies Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age Tempests were not alone removed from nature but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts which now cause such uproar and engender such confusion Avarice ambition cruelty selfishness were never heard of cordial affection compassion sympathy were the only movements with which the mind was yet acquainted Even the punctilious distinction of  mine  and  thine  was banished from among that happy race of mortals and carried with it the very notion  of property and obligation justice and injustice  Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the human race such profuse abundance of all external conveniences that without any uncertainty in the event without any care or industry on our part every individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious appetites can want or luxurious imagination wish or desire His natural beauty we shall suppose surpasses all acquired ornaments The perpetual clemency of the season renders useless all clothes or covering The raw herbage affords him the most delicious fare the clear fountain the richest beverage No laborious occupation required no tillage no navigation Music poetry and contemplation form his sole business conversation mirth and friendship his sole amusement  Thus the Hours pass unperceived along and lead in their wanton train all the pleasures of sense and all the joys of harmony and friendship Smiling  Innocence  closes the procession and while she presents herself to our ravished eyes she embellishes the whole scene and renders the view of these pleasures as transporting after they have passed us as when with languishing countenances they were yet advancing towards us  HUMANITY  When  Pericles  the great  Athenian  statesman and general was on his deathbed his surrounding friends deeming him now insensible began to indulge their sorrow for their expiring patron by enumerating his great qualities and successes his conquests and victories the unusual length of his administration and his nine trophies erected over the enemies of the republic 'You forget' cries the dying hero who had heard all 'you forget the most eminent of my praises while you dwell so much on those vulgar advantages in which fortune had the principal share You have not observed that no citizen has ever yet worn mourning on my account'  While the human heart is compounded of the same elements as at present it will never be wholly indifferent to the public good nor entirely unaffected with the tendency of characters and manners and though this affection of humanity may not generally be esteemed so strong as vanity or ambition yet being common to all men it can alone be the foundation of morals or of any general system of blame or praise One man's ambition is not another's ambition nor will the same event or object satisfy both but the humanity of one man is the humanity of every one and the same object touches this passion in all human creatures  Does the sage preserve himself always in this philosophic indifference and rest contented with lamenting the miseries of mankind without ever employing himself for their relief Does he constantly indulge this severe wisdom which by pretending to elevate him above human accidents does in reality harden his heart and render him careless of the interest of mankind and of society No he knows that in this sullen apathy neither true wisdom nor true happiness is to be found He feels too strongly the charm of the social affections ever to counteract so sweet so natural so virtuous a propensity Even when bathed in tears he laments the miseries of the human race of his country of his friends and unable to give succour can only relieve them by compassion he yet rejoices in the generous disposition and feels a satisfaction superior to that of the most indulged sense So engaging are the sentiments of humanity that they brighten up the very face of sorrow and operate like the sun which shining on a dusky cloud or falling rain paints on them the most glorious colours that are to be found in the whole circle of nature  Knowledge in the arts of government naturally begets mildness and moderation by instructing men in the advantages of humane maxims above rigour and severity which drive subjects into rebellion and make the return to submission impracticable by cutting off all hopes of pardon  When the tempers of men are softened as well as their knowledge improved this humanity appears still more conspicuous and is the chief characteristic which distinguishes a civilized age from times of barbarity and ignorance Factions are then less inveterate revolutions less tragical authority less severe and seditions less frequent Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty and after the field of battle where honour and interest steel men against compassion as well as fear the combatants divest themselves of the brute and resume the man  What charms are there in the harmony of minds and in a friendship founded on mutual esteem and gratitude What satisfaction in relieving the distressed in comforting the afflicted in raising the fallen and in stopping the career of cruel fortune or of more cruel man in their insults over the good and virtuous  THE VOLUPTUARY  I examine the voluptuous man before enjoyment I measure the vehemence of his desire and the importance of his object I find that all his happiness proceeds only from that hurry of thought which takes him from himself and turns his views from his guilt and misery I consider him a moment afterhe has now enjoyed the pleasure which he fondly sought after The sense of his guilt and misery returns upon him with double  anguish his mind tormented with fear and remorse his body depressed with disgust and satiety  The joys of love however furious and tumultuous banish not the tender sentiments of sympathy and affection they even derive their chief influence from that generous passion and when presented alone afford nothing to the unhappy mind but lassitude and disgust Behold the sprightly debauchee who professes a contempt of all other pleasures but those of wine and jollity separate him from his companions like a spark from a fire where before it contributed to the general blaze his alacrity suddenly extinguishes and though surrounded with every other means of delight he loaths the sumptuous banquet and prefers even themost abstract study and speculation as more agreeable and entertaining  INHUMANITY  The inhuman sports exhibited at  Rome  may justly be considered as an effect of the people's contempt for slaves and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers Who can read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertainments without horror or who is surprised that the emperors should treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors One's humanity on that occasion is apt to renew the barbarous wish of  Caligula  that the people had but one neck  a man could almost be pleased by a single blow to put an end to such a race of monsters  LOVE  LOVE is a restless and impatient passion full of caprices and variations arising in a moment from a feature from an air from nothing and suddenly extinguishing after the same manner Such a passion requires liberty above all things and therefore  Eloisa  had reason when in order to preserve this passion she refused to marry her beloved  Abelard  How oft when press'd to marriage have I said  Curse on all laws but those which Love has made  Love free as air at sight of human ties  Spreads his light wings and in a moment flies  MORTALITY  CONSIDER that if life be frail if youth be transitory we should well employ the present moment and lose no part of so perishing an existence Yet a little moment and these shall be no more we shall be as though we had never been not a memory of us be left upon earth and even fabulous shades will not afford us an habitation Our fruitless anxieties our vain projects our uncertain speculation shall all be swallowed up and lost Our present doubts concerning the original cause of all things must never alas be resolved This alone we may be certain of that if any governing mind preside over the universe he must be pleased to see us  fulfil the ends of our being and enjoy that pleasure for which alone we were created  FRIENDSHIP  MOST men of generous tempers are apt to envy the great when they consider the large opportunities such persons have of doing good to their fellow creatures and of acquiring the friendship and esteem of men of merit They make no advances in vain and are not obliged to associate with those whom they have little kindness for like people of inferiour stations who are subject to have their proffers of friendship rejected even where they would be most fond of placing their affections But though the great have more facility in acquiring friendships they cannot be so certain of the sincerity of them as men of a lower rank since the favours they bestow may acquire them flattery instead of goodwill and kindness We attach ourselves more by the services we perform than by those we receive and a man is in danger of losing his friends by obliging them too far I should therefore chuse to lie in the middle way and to have my commerce with my friend varied both by obligations given and received I have too much pride to be willing that all the obligations should be on my side and should be afraid that if they all lay on his he would also have too much pride to be entirely easy under them or have perfect complacency in my company  Friendship is a calm and sedate affection conducted by reason and cemented by habit springing from long acquaintance and mutual obligations without jealousies or fears and without those feverish fits of heat and cold which cause such an agreeable torment in the amorous passions So sober an affection therefore as friendship rather thrives under restraint and never rises to such an height as when any strong interest or necessity binds two persons together and gives them some common object of pursuit  MEDIOCRITY OF FORTUNE  THE middle station of life is most favourable to the acquiring of wisdom and ability as well as of virtue and a man so situate has a better chance of attaining a knowledge both of men and things than those of a more elevated station He enters with more familiarity into human life every thing appears in its natural colours before him he has more leisure to form observations and has besides the motive of ambition to push him on in his attainments being certain that he can never rises to any distinction or eminence in the world without his own industry  MARRIAGE  LET us consider whether love or friendship should most predominate in marriage and we shall soon determine whether liberty or constraint be the most favourable to it The happiest marriages to be sure are found where love by long  acquaintance is consolidated into friendship Whoever dreams of raptures and extasies beyond the honeymoon is a fool Even romances themselves with all their liberty of fiction are obliged to drop their lovers the very day of their marriage and find it easier to support the passion for a dozen years under coldness disdain and difficulties than a week under possession and security We need not therefore be afraid of drawing the marriage knot the closest possible The friendship betwixt the persons where it is solid and sincere will rather gain by it and where it is wavering and uncertain this is the best expedient of fixing it How many frivolous quarrels and disgusts are there which people of common prudence endeavour to forget when they lie under the necessity of passing their lives together but which would soon enflame into the most deadly hatred were they pursued to the utmost under the prospect of an easy separation  JEALOUSY  A  SPANIARD  is jealous of the very thoughts of those who approach his wife and if possible will prevent his being dishonoured even by the wantonness of imagination When the mother of the late King of  Spain  was on her road to  Madrid  she passed through a little town in  Spain  famous for its manufactory of gloves and stockings The honest magistrates of the place thought they could not better express their joy for the reception of their  new Queen than by presenting her with a sample of those commodities for which alone their town was remarkable The MajorDomo who conducted the Queen received the gloves very graciously but when the stockings were presented he flung them away with great indignation and severely reprimanded the magistrates for this egregious piece of indecency "Know" says he "that a Queen of  Spain  has no legs" The poor young Queen who at that time understood the language but very imperfectly and had been often frightened with stories of  Spanish  jealousy imagined they were to cut off her legs upon which she sell acrying and begged them to conduct her back to  Germany  for that she never could endure that operation and it was with some difficulty they could appease her  Philip  IV is said never in his life to have laughed heartily but at the recital of this story  DIVORCE  HOW often does disgust and aversion rise after marriage from the most trivial accidents or from an incompatibility of humour where time instead of curing the wounds proceeding from mutual injuries does every day fester them the more by new quarrels and reproaches Let us separate hearts which are not made for each other Each of them may perhaps find another for which it is better fitted at least nothing can be more cruel than to preserve by violence an union which at first was made by mutual love and is now in effect dissolved by mutual hatred  The liberty of divorce is not only a cure to hatred and domestic quarrels it is also an admirable preservative against them and the only secret for keeping alive that love which first united the married couple The heart of man delights in liberty the very image of constraint is grievous to it when you would confine it by violence to what would otherwise have been its choice its inclination immediately changes and desire is turned into aversion If the public interest will not allow us to enjoy in polygamy that variety which is so agreeable in love deprive us not at least of that liberty which is so essentially requisite In vain you tell me that I had my choice of the person with whom I would conjoin myself I had my choice it is true of my prison but this is only a small comfort since it must still be a prison  PLEASURE  See propitious to my wishes the divine the amiable Pleasure the supreme love of God and men advances towards me At her approach my heart beats with genial heat and every sense and every faculty is dissolved in joy while she pours around me all the embellishments of the Spring and all the treasures of the Autumn The melody of her voice charms my ear with the softest music as she incites me to partake of those delicious fruits which with a smile that diffuses glory in the heavens and the earth she presents to me The sportive  cupids that attend her fan me with their odoriferous wings or pour on my head the most fragrant oils or offer me their sparkling nectar in golden goblets O forever let me spread my limbs on this bed of roses and thus thus feel the delicious moments with soft and downy steps glide along But cruel chance whither do ye flee so fast Why do my ardent wishes and that load of pleasures which you labour under rather hasten than retard your unrelenting pace Suffer me to enjoy this soft repose after all my fatigues in search of happiness Suffer me to satiate myself with these delicacies after the pains of so long and so foolish an abstinence  FAME  THE love of fame rules with such uncontrouled authority in all generous minds that it is often the grand object of all their designs and undertakings By our continual and earnest pursuit of a character a name a reputation in the world we bring our own deportment and conduct frequently in review and consider how they appear in the eyes of those who approach and regard us This constant habit of surveying ourselves as it were in reflection keeps alive all the sentiments of right and wrong and begets in noble natures a certain reverence for themselves as well as others which is the surest guardian of every virtue The animal conveniences and pleasure sink gradually in their value while every inward beauty and moral grace is  studiously acquired and the mind is accomplished in every perfection which can adorn or embellish a rational creature  I was lately lamenting to a friend of mine who loves a conceit that popular applause should be bestowed with so little judgment and that so many empty forward coxcombs should rise up to a figure in the world upon which he said there was nothing surprising in the case "Popular same" says he "is nothing but a breath of air and air very naturally presses into a vacuum"  AMBITION  CANUTE  who was the greatest and most powerful Prince of his time Sovereign of  Denmark  and  Norway  as well as of  England  could not fail to meet with adulation from his courtiers a tribute which is liberally paid even to the meanest and weakest Princes Some of his flatterers breaking out one day in admiration of his grandeur exclaimed that every thing was possible for him upon which the Monarch it is said ordered his chair to be set on the seashore while the tide was making and as the waters approached he commanded them to retire and to obey the voice of him who was Lord of the Ocean He feigned to fit some time in expectation of their submission but when the sea still advanced towards him and began to wash him with its billows he turned to his  courtiers and remarked to them that every creature in the universe was feeble and impotent and that power resided with One Being alone in whose hands were all the elements of nature who could say to the ocean "Thus far shalt thou go and no further" and who could level with his nod the most towering piles of human pride and ambition  HUMAN ACTIVITY  THERE is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for exercise and employment and this desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits Deprive a man of all business and serious occupation he runs restless from one amusement to another and the weight and oppression which he feels from idleness is so great that he forgets the ruin which must follow from his immoderate expences Give him a more harmless way of employing his mind or body he is satisfied and feels no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure But if the employment you give him be profitable especially if the profit be attached to every particular exertion of industry he has gain so often in his eye that he acquires by degrees a passion for it and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing the daily increase of his fortune  COURAGE  THE utility of courage both to the public and to the person possessed of it is an obvious foundation of merit but to any one who duly considers of the matter it will appear that this quality has a peculiar lustre which it derives wholly from itself and from that noble elevation inseparable from it Its figure drawn by painters and by poets displays in each feature a sublimity and daring confidence which catches the eye engages the affections and diffuses by sympathy a like sublimity of sentiment over every spectator  The martial temper of the  Romans  inflamed by continual wars had raised their esteem of courage so high that in their language it was called  virtue  by way of excellence and of distinction from all other moral qualities The  Suevi  in the opinion of  Tacitus  dressed their hair with a laudable intent not for the purpose of loving or being beloved they adorned themselves only for their enemies and in order to appear more terrible  DUELLING  NOTHING surely can be more absurd and barbarous than the practice of duelling but those who justify it say that it begets civility and goodmanners and a duellist always values himself upon his courage his sense of honour his fidelity and  friendship qualities which are here very oddly directed but which have been esteemed universally since the foundation of the world  MAGNANIMITY  OF the same class of virtues with courage is that undisturbed philosophical tranquillity superior to pain sorrow anxiety and each assault of adverse fortune Conscious of his own virtue the Sage elevates himself above every accident of life and securely placed in the temple of wisdom looks down on inferior mortals engaged in pursuits of honours riches reputation and every frivolous enjoyment These pretensions no doubt when stretched to the utmost are by far too magnificent for human nature they carry however a grandeur with them which seizes the spectator and strikes him with admiration and the nearer we can approach in practice to this sublime tranquillity and indifference the more secure enjoyment shall we attain within ourselves and the more greatness of mind shall we discover to the world This philosophical tranquillity may indeed be considered only as a branch of magnanimity  Who admires not  Socrates  his perpetual serenity and contentment amidst the greatest poverty and domestic vexation his resolute contempt of riches and magnanimous care of preserving liberty while  he refused all assistance from his friends and disciples and avoided even the dependence of an obligation  Epictetus  had not so much as a door to his little house or hovel and therefore soon lost his iron lamp the only furniture which he had worth taking but resolving to disappoint all robbers for the future he supplied its place with an earthen lamp of which he very peaceably kept possession ever after  The excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of  Charles  XII ruined his own country and infested all his neighbours but have such splendour and greatness in their appearance as strike us with admiration and they might in some degree be even approved of if they betrayed not sometimes too evident symptoms of madness and disorder  Who can dispute that a mind which supports a perpetual serenity and cheerfulness a noble dignity and undaunted spirit a tender affection and goodwill to all around as it has more enjoyment within itself is also a more animating and rejoicing spectacle than if dejected with melancholy tormented with anxiety irritated with rage or sunk into the most abject baseness and degeneracy  POLITENESS  AS the mutual shocks in society and the oppositions of interest and selflove have constrained  mankind to establish the laws of justice in order to preserve the advantages of common assistance and protection in like manner the eternal contrarieties in company of men's pride and selfconceit have introduced the rules of goodmanners or politeness in order to facilitate the intercourse of minds and an undisturbed commerce and conversation Among wellbred people a mutual deference is affected contempt of others disguised authority concealed attention given to each in his turn and an easy stream of conversation maintained without vehemence without mutual interruption without eagerness for oratory and without any airs of superiority These attentions and regards are immediately agreeable to others abstracted from any consideration of utility or beneficial tendencies they conciliate affection promote esteem and extremely enhance the merit of the person who regulates his behaviour by them  Many of the forms of breeding are arbitrary and casual but the thing expressed by them is still the same A  Spaniard  goes out of his own house before his guests to signify that he leaves him master of all in other countries the landlord walks out last as a common mark of deference and regard  MODESTY  MODESTY may be understood in different senses It sometimes means that tenderness and  nicety of honour that apprehension of blame that dread of intrusion or injury towards others that  pudor  which is the proper guardian of every kind of virtue and a sure preservative against vice and corruption but its most usual meaning is when it is opposed to impudence and arrogance and expresses a diffidence of our own judgment and due attention and regard for others In young men chiefly this quality is a sure sign of goodsense and is also the certain means of augmenting that endowment by preserving their ears open to instruction and making them still grasp after new entertainments But it has a farther charm to every spectator by flattering every man's vanity and presenting the appearance of a docile pupil who receives with proper attention and respect every word they utter  'Tis wonderful to observe what airs of superiority fools and knaves with large possessions give themselves above men of the greatest merit in poverty nor do the men of merit make any strong opposition to these usurpations or rather seem to favour them by the modesty of their behaviour Their goodsense and experience make them diffident of their judgment and cause them to examine every thing with the greatest accuracy as on the other hand the delicacy of their sentiments makes them timorous left they commit faults and lose in the practice of the world that integrity of virtue of which they are so jealous To make wisdom  agree with confidence is as difficult as to reconcile vice to modesty  HONOUR  NOR need we fear that men by losing their ferocity will lose their martial spirit or become less undaunted and vigorous in defence of their country or their liberty The arts have no such effect in enervating either the mind or body on the contrary industry their inseparable attendant adds new force to both and if anger which is said to be the whetstone of courage loses somewhat of its asperity by politeness and refinement a sense of honour which is a stronger more constant and more governable principle acquires fresh vigour by that elevation of genius which arises from knowledge and a good education  PHILOSOPHY  TO reconcile the indifference and contingency of human actions with prescience or to defend absolute decrees and yet free the Deity from being the author of sin has been found hitherto to exceed all the power of Philosophy Happy if she be thence sensible of her temerity when she pries into these sublime mysteries and leaving a scene so full of obscurities and perplexities returns with suitable modesty to her true and proper province the examination of common life where she will find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries  without launching into so boundless an ocean of doubt uncertainty and contradiction  What a malignant philosophy must it be that will not allow to humanity and friendship the same privileges which are indisputably granted to the darker passions of enmity and resentment Such a philosophy is more like a satire than a true delineation or description of human nature and may be a good foundation for paradoxical wit and raillery but is a very bad one for any serious argument or reasoning  Though the philosophical truth of any proposition by no means depends on its tendency to promote the interest of society yet a man has but a bad grace who delivers a theory however true which he must confess leads to a practice dangerous and pernicious Why rake into those corners of nature which spread nuisance all around Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried The ingenuity of your researches may be admired but your systems will be detested and mankind will agree if they cannot refute them to sink them at least in eternal silence and oblivion Truths which are pernicious to society if any such there be will yield to errors which are salutary and advantageous  But what philosophical truths can be more advantageous to society than those which represent  Virtue in all her genuine and most engaging charms and make us approach her with ease familiarity and affection The dismal dress falls off with which many divines and some philosophers had covered her and nothing appears but gentleness humanity beneficence affability nay even at proper intervals play frolic and gaiety She talks not of useless austerities and rigours suffering and selfdenial She declares that her sole purpose is to make her votaries and all mankind during every instant of their existence if possible chearful and happy nor does she ever willingly part with any pleasure but in hopes of ample compensation in some other period of their lives The sole trouble which she demands is that of just calculation and a steady preference of the greater happiness And if any austere pretenders approach her enemies to joy and pleasure she either rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers or if she admits them in her train they are ranked however as the least favoured of her votaries  Those who have a propensity to philosophy will still continue their researches because they reflect that besides the immediate pleasure attending such an occupation philosophical decisions are nothing but the reflections of common life methodised and corrected But they will never be tempted to go beyond common life so long as they consider the imperfection of those faculties which they employ their narrow reach and their inaccurate operations  While we cannot give a satisfactory reason why we believe after a thousand experiments that a stone will fall or fire burn can we ever satisfy ourselves concerning any determination which we may form with regard to the origin of worlds and the siuation of nature from and to eternity  A man may as well pretend to cure himself of love by viewing his mistress through the artificial medium of a microscope or prospect and beholding there the coarseness of her skin and monstrous disproportion of her features as hope to excite or moderate any passion by the artificial arguments of a Seneca or an Epictetus The remembrance of the natural aspect and situation of the object will in both cases still recur upon him The reflections of philosophy are too subtle and distant to take place in common life or eradicate any affection The air is too fine to breathe in where it is above the winds and clouds of the atmosphere  His appears the most perfect charcter who retaining an equal ability and taste for books company and business preserves in conversation that discernment and delicacy which are the natural result of a just philosophy In order to diffuse and cultivate so accomplished a character nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner which draw not too much from life require no deep application or retreat to be comprehended and send back the student among mankind  full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigence of human life By means of such compositions virtue becomes amiable science agreable company instructive and retirement entertaining  The easy and obvious philosophy will always with the generality of mankind have the preference above the accurate and abstruse and by many will be recommended not only as more agreeable but more useful than the other It enters more into common life moulds the heart and affections and by touching those principles which actuate men reforms their conduct and brings them nearer that model of perfection which it describes Abstruse philosophy being founded on a turn of mind which cannot enter into business and action vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade and comes into open day nor can its principles easily retain any influence over our conduct and behaviour The feelings of our heart the agitation of our passions the vehemence of our affections dissipate all its conclusions and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian  In every art or profession even those which most concern life or action a spirit of accuracy however acquired carries all of them nearer their perfection and renders them more subservient to the interests of society And though a philosopher may live remote from business the genius of philosophy  if carefully cultivated by several must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtlety in the subdividing and balancing of power the lawyer more method and finer principles in his reasonings and the general more regularity in his discipline and more caution in his plans and operations The stability of modern governments above the ancient and the accuracy of modern philosophy have improved and probably will still improve by similar gradations  METAPHYSICS  ARE not properly a science but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the understanding or from the craft of popular superstitions which being unable to defend themselves on fair ground raise these entangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness Chaced from the open country these robbers fly into the forest and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind and overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices The stoutest antagonist if he remit his watch a moment is oppressed and many through cowardice and folly open the gates to the enemy and willingly receive them with reverence and submission as their legal sovereigns  PHILOSOPHERS  WERE we to distinguish the ranks of men by their genius and capacity more than by their virtue and usefulness to the public great philosophers would certainly challenge the first rank and must be placed at the top of human kind So rare is this character that perhaps there has not as yet been above two in the world who can lay a just claim to it at least  Galileo  and  Newton  seem to me so far to excel all the rest that I cannot admit any other into the same class with them  Moral philosophers consider man chiefly as born for action and as influenced in his actions by taste and sentiment pursuing one object and avoiding another according to the value which these objects seem to possess and according to the light in which they present themselves As virtue of all objects is allowed to be the most valuable these philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours borrowing all helps from poetry and eloquence and treating their subject in an easy and obvious manner and such as is best fitted to please the imagination and engage the affections They select the most striking observations and instances from common life place opposite character in a proper contrast and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness direct our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples They make us feel the difference  between vice and virtue they excite and regulate our sentiments and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity and true honour they think that they have fully attained the end of all their labours  GALLANTRY  TO correct such gross vices as lead us to commit real injury on others is the part of morals and the object of the most ordinary education Where that is not attended to in some degree no human society can subsist But in order to render conversation and the intercourse of minds more easy and agreeable goodmanners have been invented and have carried the matter somewhat farther Whereever nature has given the mind a propensity to any vice or to any passion disagreeable to others refined breeding has taught men to throw the biass on the opposite side and to preserve in all their behaviour the appearance of sentiments different from those to which they naturally incline Thus as we are commonly proud and selfish and apt to assume the preference above others a polite man learns to behave with deference towards his companions and to yield the superiority to them in all the common incidents of society In like manner wherever a person's situation may naturally beget any disagreeable suspicion in him it is the part of goodmanners to prevent it by a studied display of sentiments directly contrary to those of which he is apt to be jealous Thus old men know their  infirmities and naturally dread contempt from the youth hence welleducated youth redouble the instances of respect and deference to their elders Strangers and foreigners are without protection hence in all polite countries they receive the highest civilities and are intitled to the first place in every company A man is lord in his own family and his guests are in a manner subject to his authority hence he is always the lowest person in the company attentive to the wants of every one and giving himself all the trouble in order to please which may not betray too visible an affectation or impose too much constraint on his guests Gallantry is nothing but an instance of the same generous attention As nature has given man the superiority above woman by endowing him with greater strength both of mind and body it is his part to alleviate that superiority as much as possible by the generosity of his behaviour and by a studied deference for all her inclinations and opinions Barbarous nations display this superiority by reducing their females to the most abject slavery by confining them by beating them by selling them by killing them But the male sex among a polite people discover their authority in a more generous though not a less evident manner by civility by respect by complaisance and in a word by gallantry In good company you need not ask who is the master of the feast The man who sits in the lowest place and who is always industrious in helping every one is certainly the person  We must either condemn all such instances of generosity as foppish and affected or admit of gallantry among the rest The ancient  Muscovites  wedded their wives with a whip instead of a ring The same people in their own houses took always the precedence above foreigners even foreign ambassadors  Gallantry is not less consistent with wisdom and prudence than with nature and generosity and when under proper regulations contributes more than any other invention to the entertainment and improvement of both sexes Among every species of animals nature has founded on the love between the sexes their sweetest and best enjoyments But the satisfaction of the bodily appetite is not alone sufficient to gratify the mind and even among brute creatures we find that their play and dalliance and other expressions of fondness form the greatest part of the entertainment In rational beings we must certainly admit the mind for a considerable share Were we to rob the feast of all its garniture of reason discourse sympathy friendship and gaiety what remains would scarcely be worth acceptance in the judgment of the truly elegant and luxurious  MAN  MAN is a reasonable being and as such receives from science his proper food and nourishment but so narrow are the bounds of human  understanding that little satisfaction can be hoped for in this particular either from the extent or security of his acquisitions  Man is a sociable no less than a reasonable being but neither can he always enjoy company agreeable and amusing or preserve the proper relish for them  Man is also an active being and from that dispostion as well as from the various necessities of human life must submit to business and occupation  MEN AND ANIMALS  ON the one hand we see a creature whose thoughts are not limited by any narrow bounds either of place or time who carries his researches into the most distant regions of this globe and beyond this globe to the planets and heavenly bodies looks backward to consider the first origin at least the history of human race casts his eyes forward to see the influence of his actions upon posterity and the judgments which will be formed of his character a thousand years hence a creature who traces causes and effects to a great length and intricacy extracts general principles from particular appearances improves upon his discoveries corrects his mistakes and makes his very errors profitable On the other hand we are presented with a creature the very reverse of this limited  in its observations and reasonings to a few sensible objects which surround it without curiosity without foresight blindly conducted by instinct and attaining in a short time its utmost perfection beyond which it is never able to advance a single step What a wide difference is there between these creatures And how exalted a notion must we entertain of the former in comparison of the latter  TRUTH AND TASTE  TRUTH is disputable not taste what exists in the nature of things is the standard of our judgment what each man feels within himself is the standard of sentiment Propositions in geometry may be proved systems in physic may be controverted but the harmony of verse the tenderness of passion the brilliancy of wit must give immediate pleasure No man reasons concerning another's beauty but frequently concerning the justice or injustice of his actions In every criminal trial the first object of the prisoner is to disprove she facts alledged and deny the actions imputed to him the second to prove that even if these actions were real they might be justified as innocent and lawful It is confessedly by deductions of the understanding that the first point is ascertained how can we suppose that a different faculty of the mind is employed in fixing the other  GENEROSITY  IT would be difficult to shew why a man is more a loser by a generous action than by any other method of expence since the utmost which he can attain by the most elaborate selfishness is the indulgence of some affection  Once on a time a statesman in the shock and contest of parties prevailed so far as to procure by his eloquence the banishment of an able adversary whom he secretly followed offering him money for his support during his exile and soothing him with topics of consolation in his misfortunes "Alas" cries the banished statesman "with what regret must I leave my friends in this city where even enemies are so generous"  GLORY  YE favoured of Heaven while the wanton Spring pours upon you all her blooming honours let not Glory seduce you with her delusive blaze to pass in perils and dangers this delicious season this prime of life Wisdom points out to you the road to pleasure Nature too beckons to you to follow her in that smooth and slowery path will you shut your ears to their commanding voice Will you harden your heart to their soft allurements Oh deluded mortals thus to lose your youth thus to throw away so invaluable a present to  trifle with so perishing a blessing Contemplate well your recompense consider that Glory which so allures your proud hearts and seduces you with your own praises 'tis an echo a dream nay the shadow of a dream which is dissipated by every wind and lost by every contrary breath of the ignorant and illjudging multitude You fear not that even death itself will ravish it from you but behold while you are yet alive calumny bereaves you of it ignorance neglects it nature enjoys it not fancy alone renouncing every pleasure receives this airy recompense empty and unstable as itself  SCIENCE  THOSE who cultivate the sciences in any state are always few in number the passion that governs them limited their taste and judgment tender and easily perverted and their applications disturbed by the smallest accident Chance therefore or secret and unknown causes must have a great influence on the rise and progress of all the refined arts  Greece  was a cluster of little principalities which soon became republics and being united both by their near neighbourhood and by the ties of the same language and interest they entered into the closest intercourse of commerce and of learning There concurred a happy climate a fertile soil and a most harmonious and comprehensive  language so that every circumstance among that people seemed to favour the rise of the arts and sciences Each city produced its several artists and philosophers who refused to yield the preference to those of the neighbouring republics Their debates and contentions sharpened the wits of men a variety of objects was presented to the judgment while each challenged the preference to the rest and the sciences not being dwarfed by the restraint of authority were enabled to make such considerable shoots as are even at this time the objects of our admiration  It seems that Nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as most suitable to the human race Indulge your passion for science says she but let your science be human and such as may have a direct reference to action and society Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit and will severely punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you and by the cold reception which your pretended discoveries shall meet with when communicated Be a philosopher but amidst all your philosophy be still a man  A serious attention to the sciences and liberal arts softens and humanises the temper and cherishes those fine emotions in which true virtue and honour consist It rarely very rarely happens that a man of taste and learning is not at least  an honest man whatever frailties may attend him The bent of his mind to speculative studies must mortify in him the passions of interest and ambition and must at the same time give him a greater sensibility of all the decencies and duties of life He feels more fully a moral distinction in characters and manners nor is his sense of this kind diminished but on the contrary it is much increased by speculation  GENIUS  COURAGE and resolution are chiefly requisite in a commander justice and humanity in a statesman but genius and capacity in a scholar Great generals and great politicians are found in all ages and countries of the world and frequently start out at once even amongst the greatest barbarians  Sweden  was sunk in ignorance when it produced  Gustavus Ericson  and  Gustavus Adolphus Muscovy  when the Czar appeared and perhaps  Carthage  when it gave birth to  Hannibal  but  England  must pass through a long gradation of its  Spensers Jonsons Wallers Drydens  before it arrive at an  Addison  or a  Pope  A happy talent for the liberal arts and sciences is a kind of prodigy among men Nature must afford the richest genius that comes from her hands education and example must cultivate it from the earliest infancy and industry must concur to carry it to any degree of perfection No man needs be surprised to see  Kouli Kan  among  the  Persians  but  Homer  in so early an age among the  Greeks  is certainly a matter of the highest wonder  HAPPINESS  TO be happy the passion must neither be too violent nor too remiss In the first case the mind is in a perpetual hurry and tumult in the second it sinks into a disagreeable indolence and lethargy  To be happy the passion must be benign and social not rough or fierce The affections of the latter kind are not near so agreeable to the feeling as those of the former Who will compare rancour and animosity envy and revenge to friendship benignity clemency and gratitude  To be happy the passion must be chearful and gay not gloomy and melancholy A propensity to hope and joy is real riches one to fear and sorrow real poverty  Indeed all the difference between the conditions of life depends upon the mind nor is there any one situation of affairs in itself preferable to another Good and ill both natural and moral are entirely relative to human sentiment and affection No man would ever be unhappy could he alter his feelings  Proteus  like he would elude all attacks by the continual alteration of his shape and form  By doing good only can a man truly enjoy the advantages of being eminent His exalted station of itself but the more exposes to danger and tempest His sole prerogative is to afford shelter to inferiors who repose themselves under his cover and protection  Inward peace of mind consciousness of integrity a satisfactory review of our own couduct are circumstances very requisite to happiness and will be cherished and cultivated by every honest man who feels the importance of them  BENEVOLENCE  THE very softness and tenderness of this sentiment its engaging endearments its fond expressions its delicate attentions and that flow of mutual confidence and regard which enters into a warm attachment of love and friendship being delightful in themselves are necessarily communicated to the spectators and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy The tear naturally starts in our eye on the apprehension of a warm sentiment of this nature our breast heaves our heart is agitated and every humane tender principle of our frame is set in motion and gives us the purest and most satisfactory enjoyment  No qualities are more entitled to the general goodwill and approbation of mankind than beneficence and humanity friendship and gratitude  natural affection and public spirit or whatever proceeds from a tender sympathy with others and a generous concern for our kind and species These wherever they appear seem to transfuse themselves in a manner into each beholder and to call forth in their own behalf the same favourable and affectionate sentiments which exert on all around  That species of selflove which displays itself in kindness to others you must allow to have great influence over human actions and even greater on many occasions than that which remains in its original shape and form for how few are there who having a family children and relations do not spend more on the maintenance and education of these than on their own pleasures This indeed may proceed from their selflove since the prosperity of their family and friends is one or the chief of their pleasures as well as their chief honour Be you also one of these selfish men and you are sure of every one's good opinion and goodwill the selflove of every one and mine among the rest will then incline us to serve you and speak well of you  POVERTY  XENOPHON  in the Banquet of  Socrates  gives a natural unaffected description of the tyranny of the  Athenian  people In my poverty says  Charmides  I am much more happy than I ever was while possessed of riches as much as it is happier to be in security than in terror free than a slave to receive than to pay court to be trusted than suspected Formerly I was obliged to caress every informer some imposition was continually laid upon me and it was never allowed me to travel or be absent from the city At present when I am poor I look big and threaten others the rich are afraid of me and shew me every kind of civility and respect and I am become a kind of tyrant in the city  IGNORANCE  ELASTICITY gravity cohesion of parts communication by impulse these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which we shall ever discover in nature and we may esteem ourselves sufficiently happy if by accurate enquiry and reasoning we can trace up the particular phaenomena to or near to these general principles The most perfect philosophy of the natural kind only staves off our ignorance a little longer as perhaps the most perfect philosophy of the moral of metaphysical kind serves only to discover larger portions of our ignorance Thus the observation of human blindness and weakness is the result of all philosophy and meets us at every turn in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it  THE HUMAN SOUL  IS there any principle in all nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body by which a supposed spiritual substance acquires such an influence over a material one that the most refined thought is able to actuate the grossest matter Were we empowered by a secret wish to remove mountains or control the planets in their orbits this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary nor more beyond our comprehension  JUSTICE  THE rules of equity or justice depend entirely on the particular state and condition in which men are placed and owe their origin and existence to that utility which results to the public from their strict and regular observance Reverse in any considerable circumstance the condition of men produce extreme abundance or extreme necessity implant in the human breast perfect moderation and humanity or perfect rapaciousness and malice by rendering justice totally useless you thereby totally destroy its essence and suspend its obligation on mankind  Were the interests of society no wise concerned it is as unintelligible why another's articulating certain sounds implying consent should change the nature of my actions with regard to a particular  object as why the reciting of a liturgy by a priest in a certain habit and posture should dedicate a heap of bricks and timber and render it thenceforth and for ever sacred  As justice evidently tends to promote public utility and to support civil society the sentiment of justice is either derived from our reflecting on that tendency or like hunger thirst and other appetites resentment love of life attachment to offspring and other passions arises from a simple original instinct in the human breast which nature has implanted for like salutary purposes If the latter be the case it follows that property which is the object of justice is also distinguished by a simple original instinct and is not ascertained by any argument or reflection But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct Or is this a subject In which new discoveries can be made We may as well expect to discover in the body new senses which had before escaped the observation of all mankind  PROPERTY  WHAT other reason indeed could writers ever give why this must be mine and that yours since uninstructed nature surely never made any such distinction The objects which receive those appellations are of themselves foreign to us they are totally disjoined and separated from us and nothing but the general interest of society can form the connection  What is a man's property Any thing which it is lawful for him and for him alone to use But what rule have we by which we can distinguish these objects Here we must have recourse to statutes customs precedents analogies and a hundred other circumstances some of which are constant and inflexible some variable and arbitrary But the ultimate point in which they all professedly terminate is the interest and happiness of human society Where this enters not into consideration nothing can appear more whimsical unnatural and even superstitious than all or most of the laws of justice and of property  IMAGINATION  NOTHING is more dangerous to reason than the flights of imagination and nothing has been the occasion of more mistakes among philosophers Men of bright fancies may in this respect be compared to those angels whom the Scripture represents as covering their eyes with their wings  DELICACY OF PASSION  SOME people are subject to a certain delicacy of passion which makes them extremely sensible to all the accidents of life and gives them a lively joy upon every prosperous event as well as a piercing grief when they meet with misfortunes and adversity Favours and good offices easily engage their friendship while the smallest injury  provokes their resentment Any honour or mark of distinction elevates them above measure but they are as sensibly touched with contempt  DELICACY OF TASTE  IS itself a beauty in any character as conveying the purest the most durable and most innocent of all enjoyments  When you present a poem or a picture to a man possessed of this talent the delicacy of his feelings makes him be sensibly touched with every part of it nor are the masterly strokes perceived with more exquisite relish and satisfaction than the negligencies and absurdities with disgust and uneasiness A polite and judicious conversation affords him the highest entertainment rudeness or impertinence is as great a punishment to him  ART  IT is a great mortification to the vanity of man that his utmost art or industry can never equal the meanest of Nature's productions either for beauty or value Art is only the under workman and is employed to give a few strokes of embellishment to those pieces which come from the hand of the master Some of the drapery may be of his drawing but he is not allowed to touch the principal figure Art may make a suit of clothes but Nature must produce a man  SIMPLICITY  NO advantages in this world are pure and unmixed In like manner as modern politeness which is naturally so ornamental runs often into affectation and foppery disguise and insincerity so the ancient simplicity which is naturally so amiable and affecting often degenerates into rusticity and abuse scurrility and obscenity Simplicity passes for dullness when it is not accompanied with great elegance and propriety  REFINEMENT  REFINEMENT on the pleasures and conveniences of life has no natural tendency to beget venality and corruption The value which all men put upon any particular pleasure depends on comparison and experience nor is a porter less greedy of money which he spends upon bacon and brandy than a courtier who purchases champagne and ortolans Riches are valuable at all times and to all men because they always purchase pleasures such as men are accustomed to and desire nor can any thing restrain or regulate the love of money but a sense of honour and virtue which if it be not nearly equal at all times will naturally abound most in ages of knowledge and refinement  VANITY  VANITY seems to consist chiefly in such an intemperate display of our advantages honours and accomplishments in such an importunate and open demand of praise and admiration as is offensive to others and encroaches too far on their secret vanity and ambition It is besides the sure symptom of the want of true dignity and elevation of mind which is so great an ornament to any character For why that impatient desire of applause as if you were not justly entitled to it and might not reasonably expect that it will for ever attend you Why so anxious to inform us of the great company you have kept the obliging things which were said to you the honours the distinctions which you met with as if these were not things of course and what we could readily of ourselves have imagined without being told of them  Every thing belonging to a vain man is the best that is any where to be found his houses equipage furniture clothes horses hounds excel all others in his conceit and it is easy to observe that from the least advantage in any of these he draws a new subject of pride and vanity His wine if you will believe him has a finer flavour than any other his cookery is more exquisite his table more orderly his servants more expert the air in which he lives more healthful the  soil which he cultivates more fertile his fruits ripen earlier and to greater perfection such a thing is remarkable for its novelty such another for its antiquity this is the workmanship of a famous artist that belonged once to such a prince or great man  MERIT  IT may justly appear surprising that any man in so late an age should find it requisite to prove by elaborate reasoning that personal merit consists altogether in the possession of mental qualities useful or agreeable to the person himself or to others Whatever is valuable in any kind so naturally classes itself under the division of useful or agreeable the  utile  or  dulce  that it is not easy to imagine why we should ever seek farther or consider the question as a matter of nice research or enquiry And as every thing useful or agreeable must possess these qualities with regard either to the person himself or to others the complete delineation or description of merit seems to be performed as naturally as a shadow is cast by the sun or an image is reflected upon water If the ground on which the shadow is cast be not broken and uneven nor the surface from which the image is reflected disturbed and confused a just figure is immediately presented without any art or attention And it seems a reasonable presumption that systems and hypotheses have perverted our natural  understanding when a theory so simple and obvious could so long have escaped the most elaborate examination  CHARACTER  YOU are very happy we shall suppose one to say addressing himself to another that you have given your daughter to  Cleanthes  He is a man of honour and humanity every one who has any intercourse with him is sure of fair and kind treatment  I congratulate you says another on the promising expectation of this soninlaw whose assiduous application to the study of the laws whose quick penetration and early knowledge both of men and business prognosticate the greatest honours and advancement  You surprise me replies a third when you talk of  Cleanthes  as a man of business and application I met him lately in a circle of the gayest company and he was the very life and soul of our conversation so much wit with goodmanners so much gallantry without affectation so much ingenious knowledge so genteelly delivered I have never before observed in any one  You would admire him still more says a fourth if you knew him more familiarly That chearfulness  which you might remark in him is not a sudden flash struck out by company it runs through the whole tenor of his life and preserves a perpetual serenity on his countenance and tranquillity in his soul He has met with severe trials misfortunes as well as dangers and by his greatness of mind was still superior to all of them  The image gentlemen which you have here delineated of  Cleanthes  cry I is that of accomplished merit Each of you has given a stroke of the pencil to his figure and you have unawares exceeded all the pictures drawn by  Gratian  or  Castiglione  A philosopher might select this character as a model of perfect virtue  DECENCY  DECENCY or a proper regard to age sex character and station in the world may be ranked among the qualities which are immediately agreeable to others and which by that means acquire praise and approbation An effeminate behaviour in a man a rough manner in a woman are ugly because unsuitable to each character and different from the qualities which we expect in the sexes It is as if a tragedy abounded in comic beauties or a comedy in tragic The disproportions hurt the eye and convey a disagreeable sentiment to the spectators the source of blame and disapprobation  CLEANLINESS  CLEANLINESS naturally renders us agreeable to others and is no inconsidarable source of love and affection No one will deny that a negligence in this particular is a fault and as faults are nothing but smaller vices and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation which it excites in others we may in this instance seemingly so trivial clearly discover the origin of moral distinctions about which the learned have involved themselves in such mazes of perplexity and error  GRACE  THERE is a manner a grace an ease a genteelness  an I know not what  which some possess above others which is very different from external beauty and comeliness and which however catches our affection almost as suddenly and powerfully And though this manner be chiefly talked of in the passion between the sexes where the concealed magic is easily explained yet surely much of it prevails in all our estimation of characters and forms no inconsiderable part of personal merit This class of accomplishments therefore must be trusted entirely to the blind but sure testimony of taste and sentiment and must be considered as a part of ethics left by nature to baffle all the pride of Philosophy and make her sensible of her narrow boundaries and slender acquisitions  CUSTOM  WHEREVER the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a propensity to renew the same act or operation without being impelled by any reasoning or process of the understanding we always say that this propensity is the effect of custom By employing that word we pretend not to have given the ultimate reason of such a propensity we only point out a principle of human nature which is universally acknowledged and which is well known by its effects  Custom is the great guide of human life It is that principle alone which renders our experience useful to us and makes us expect for the future a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past Without the influence of custom we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses we should never know how to adjust means to ends or to employ our natural powers in the production of any effect There would be an end at once of all action as well as of the chief part of speculation  ANCESTRY  OUR forefathers being conceived as our nearest relations every one naturally affects to be of a good family and to be descended from a long succession of rich and honourable ancestors  PROSPERITY AND ADVERSITY  IF we examine our own hearts or observe what passes around us we shall find that men are much oftener thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the agreeable passions Prosperity is easily received as our due and few questions are asked concerning its cause or author It begets chearfulness and activity and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every sensual and social pleasure and during this state of mind men have little leisure or inclination to think of the unknown invisible regions On the other hand every disastrous accident alarms us and sets us on enquiries concerning the principles whence it arose apprehensions spring up with regard to futurity and the mind sunk into diffidence terror and melancholy has recourse to every method of appeasing those secret intelligent Powers on whom our fortune is supposed entirely to depend  INCORRIGIBLE VICE  WHERE one is born of so perverse a frame of mind of so callous and insensible a disposition as to have no relish for virtue and humanity no sympathy with his fellowcreatures no desire of esteem and applause such an one must be allowed entirely incurable nor is there any remedy in philosophy He reaps no satisfaction but from low and sensual objects or from the indulgence of malignant passions  he feels no remorse to controul his vicious inclinations he has not even that sense or taste which is requisite to make him desire a better character  HABIT  HABIT is another powerful means of reforming the mind and implanting in it good dispositions and inclinations A man who continues in a course of sobriety and temperance will hate riot and disorder If he engage in business or study indolence will seem a punishment to him If he constrain himself to practise beneficence and affability he will soon abhor all instances of pride and violence Where one is thoroughly convinced that the virtuous course of life is preferable if he has but resolution enough for some time to impose a violence on himself his reformation needs not be despaired of The misfortune is that this conviction and this resolution never can have place unless a man be beforehand tolerably virtuous  HUMAN LIFE  GOOD and ill are universally intermingled and confounded happiness and misery wisdom and folly virtue and vice Nothing is pure and entirely of a piece All advantages are attended with disadvantages An universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence And it is not possible for us by our most chimerical wishes to form the idea of a station or situation  altogether desirable The draughts of life according to the poet's fiction are always mixed from the vessels on each hand of  Jupiter  or if any cup be presented altogether pure it is drawn only as the same poet tells us from the lefthanded vessel  When we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty of life how despicable seem all our pursuits of happiness And even if we would extend our concern beyond our own life how frivolous appear our most enlarged and most generous projects when we consider the incessant changes and revolutions of human affairs by which laws and learning books and governments are hurried away by time as by a rapid stream and are lost in the immense ocean of matter  Human life is more governed by fortune than by reason is to be regarded more as a dull pastime than as a serious occupation and is more influenced by particular humour than by general principles Shall we engage ourselves in it with passion and anxiety It is not worthy of so much concern Shall we be indifferent about what happens We lose all the pleasure of the game by our phlegm and carelessness While we are reasoning concerning life life is gone and Death though perhaps they receive him differently treats alike the fool and philosopher  The whole earth is cursed and polluted a perpetual war amongst all living creatures Necessity hunger want stimulate the strong and courageous fear anxiety terror agitate the weak and infirm The first entrance into life gives anguish to the newborn infant and to its wretched parent weakness impotence distress attend each stage of that life and it is at last finished in agony and horror  ANIMAL HOSTILITY  OBSERVE the curious artifices of nature to embitter the life of every living being The stronger prey upon the weaker and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety the weaker too in their turn often prey upon the stronger and vex and molest them without relaxation Consider that innumerable race of infects which either are bred in the body of each animal or flying about infix their stings in him These infects have others still less than themselves which torment them And thus on each hand before and behind above and below every animal is surrounded with enemies which incessantly seek his misery and destruction  THE PERILOUS CONDITION OF HUMANITY  MAN it is true can by combination surmount all his real enemies and become master of  the whole animal creation but does he not immediately raise up to himself imaginary enemies the daemons of his fancy who haunt him with superstitious terrors and blast every enjoyment of life His pleasure as he imagines becomes in their eyes a crime his food and repose give them umbrage and offence his very sleep and dreams furnish new materials to anxious fear and even death his refuge from every other ill presents only the dread of endless and innumerable woes nor does the wolf molest more the timid flock than superstition does the anxious breast of wretched mortals  This very society by which we surmount those wild beasts our natural enemies what new enemies does it not raise to us What woe and misery does it not occasion Man is the greatest enemy of man Oppression injustice contempt contumely treachery fraud by these they mutually torment each other and they would soon dissolve that society which they had formed were it not for the dread of still greater ills which must attend their separation  MENTAL DISORDERS  THE disorders of the mind though more secret are not perhaps less dismal and vexatious than those of the body Remorse shame anguish rage disappointment anxiety fear dejection despair who has ever passed through life without cruel inroads  roads from these tormentors How many have scarce ever felt better sensations Labour and poverty so abhorred by every one are the certain lot of the far greater number And those few prileged persons who enjoy case and opulence never reach contentment or true felicity All the goods of life united would not make a very happy man but all the ills united would make a wretch indeed and any one of them almost nay often the absence of one good is sufficient to render life ineligible  AN AGGREGATE OF HUMAN MISERY  WERE a stranger to drop on a sudden into this world I would shew him as a specimen of its ills an hospital full of diseases a prison crouded with malefactors and debtors a field of battle strewed with carcases a fleet foundering in the ocean a nation languishing under tyranny famine or pestilence To turn the gay side of life to him and give him a notion of its pleasures whether should I conduct him To a ball to an opera to a court He might justly think that I was only shewing him a diversity of distress and sorrow  RULES OF LIFE  IS it not certain that every condition has concealed ills Then why envy any body Every one has known ills and there is a compensation  throughout Why not be contented with the present  Custom deadens the sense both of the good and the ill and levels every thing  Health and humour all the rest of little consequence except these be affected  How many other good things have I Then why be vexed for one ill  How many are happy in the condition of which I complain How many envy me  Every good must be paid for fortune by labour favour by flattery Would I keep the price yet have the commodity  Expect not too great happiness in life human nature admits it not  Propose not a happiness too complicated But does that depend on me Yes the first choice does Life is like a game one may choose the game and passion by degrees seizes the proper object  Anticipate by your hopes and fancy future consolation which time infallibly brings to every affliction  I desire to be rich Why That I may possess many fine objects houses gardens equipage How many fine objects does nature offer to every one without expence If enjoyed sufficient If not see the effect of custom or of temper which would soon take off the relish of riches  I desire same Let this occur If I act well I shall have the esteem of all my acquaintance And what is all the rest to me  These reflections are so obvious that it is a wonder they occur not to every man so convincing that it is a wonder they persuade not every man But perhaps they do occur to and persuade most men when they consider human life by a general and calm survey But where any real affecting incident happens when passion is awakened fancy agitated example draws and counsel urges the philosopher is lost in the man and he searches in vain for that persuasion which before seemed so firm and unshaken What remedy for this inconvenience Assist yourself by a frequent perusal of the entertaining moralists have recourse to the learning of  Plutarch  the imagination of  Lucian  the eloquence of  Cicero  the wit of  Seneca  the gaiety of  Montagne  the sublimity of  Shaftesbury  Moral precepts so couched strike deep and fortify the mind against the illusion of passion But trust not altogether to external aid By habit and study acquire that philosophical temper which  both gives force to reflection and by rendering a great part of your happiness independent takes off the edge from all disorderly passions and tranquillizes the mind Despise not these helps nor conside too much in them unless nature has been favourable in the temper with which she has endowed you  HISTORY  WHEN we peruse the first histories of all nations we are apt to imagine ourselves transported into some new world where the whole frame of nature is disjointed and every element performs its operations in a different manner from what it does at present Battles revolutions pestilence famine and death are never the effect of those natural causes which we experience Prodigies omens oracles judgments quite obscure the few natural events that are intermingled with them But as the former grow thinner every page in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages we soon learn that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the case but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous and that though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learning it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human nature  DEITY  BY the same act he sees past present and future His love and hatred his mercy and justice  are one individual operation He is entire in every point of space and complete in every instant of duration No succession no change no acquifition no diminution What he is implies not in it any shadow of distinction or diversity and what he is this moment he ever has been and ever will be without any new judgment sentiment or operation He stands fixed in one simple perfect state nor can you ever say with any propriety that this act of his is different from that other that this judgment or idea has been lately formed and will give place by succession to any different judgment or idea  ELOQUENCE  ELOQUENCE when at its highest pitch leaves little room for reason or reflection but addressing itself entirely to the fancy or the affection captivates the willing hearers and subdues their understanding Happily this pitch it seldom attains but what a  Tully  or  Demosthenes  could scarcely effect over a  Roman  or  Athenian  audience every Capuchin every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform over the generality of mankind and in a higher degree by touching such gross and vulgar passions  It may be pretended that the disorders of the ancient governments and the enormous crimes of which the citizens were often guilty afforded much  ampler matter for eloquence than can be met with among the moderns Were there no  Verres  or  Catiline  there would be no  Cicero  But that this reason can have no great influence is evident 'twill be easy to find a  Philip  in modern times but where shall we find a  Demosthenes  Does any man pretend to have more goodsense than  Julius Caesar  Yet that haughty conqueror we know was so subdued by the charms of  Cicero  's eloquence that he was in a manner constrained to change his settled purpose and resolution and to absolve a criminal whom before that orator appeared he was determined to condemn  The orator by the force of his own genius and eloquence first inflamed himself with anger indignation pity sorrow and then communicated these impetuous movements to his audience  There is a great prejudice against set speeches and a man can scarce escape ridicule who repeats a discourse as a schoolboy does his lesson and takes no notice of any thing that has been advanced in the course of the debate But where is the necessity of falling into this absurdity A public speaker must know beforehand the question under debate He may compose all the arguments objections and answers such as he thinks will be most proper for his discourse If any thing new occur he may supply it from his invention  nor will the difference be very apparent betwixt his elaborate and his extemporary compositions The mind naturally continues with the same impetus or force which it has acquired by its motion as a vessel once impelled by the oars carries on its course for some time even when the original impulse is suspended  SERMONS  IF the other learned and polite nations of  Europe  had possessed the same advantages of a popular government they would probably have carried eloquence to a greater height than it has yet reached in  Britain  The  French  sermons especially those of  Flechier  and  Bourdaloue  are much superior to the  English  in this particular and in  Flechier  there are many strokes of the most sublime poetry His funeral sermon on the Marechal  de Turenne  is a good instance  RIBALDRY  THERE is a set of men lately sprung up among us who endeavour to distinguish themselves by ridiculing every thing that has hitherto appeared sacred and venerable in the eyes of mankind Reason sobriety honour friendship marriage are the perpetual subjects of their insipid raillery and even public spirit and a regard to our country are treated as chimerical and romantic Were the schemes of these antireformers to take place all the bonds of society must be broke to make  way for the indulgence of a licentious mirth and gaiety the companion of our drunken frolics must be preferred to a friend or brother dissolute prodigality must be supplied at the expence of every thing valuable either in public or private and men shall have so little regard to any thing beyond themselves that at last a free constitution of government must become a scheme perfectly impracticable among mankind and must degenerate into one universal system of fraud and corruption  PHILOSOPHICAL PRIDE  A GRAVE philosophical endeavour after perfection under pretext of reforming prejudices and errors strikes at all the most endearing sentiments of the heart and all the most useful biasses and instincts which can govern a human creature The Stoics were remarkable for this folly among the ancients and I wish some of more venerable characters in latter times had not copied them too faithfully The virtuous and tender sentiments or prejudices if you will have suffered mightily by these reflections while a certain sullen pride or contempt of mankind has prevailed in their stead and has been esteemed the greatest wisdom though in reality it be the most egregious folly  Statilius  being solicited by  Brutus  to make one of that noble band who struck the godlike stroke for the liberty of  Rome  refused to accompany them saying  That all men were fools or mad and did  not deserve that a wise man should trouble his head about them  FEROCITY  DIOGENES  being asked by his friends in his sickness what should be done with him after his death  Why  says he  throw me out into the fields  What replied they to the birds or beasts  No place a cudgel by me to defend myself withal  To what purpose say they you will not have any sense nor any power of making use of it  Then if the beasts should devour me  cries he  shall I be any more sensible of it  I know none of the sayings of that philosopher which shews more evidently both the liveliness and ferocity of his temper  THE SAGE  THE temple of Wisdom is seated on a rock above the rage of the fighting elements and inaccessible to all the malice of man The rolling thunder breaks below and those more terrible instruments of human fury reach not so sublime a height The sage while he breathes that serene air looks down with pleasure mixed with compassion on the errors of mistaken mortals who blindly seek for the true path of life and pursue riches nobility honour or power for genuine felicity The greatest part lie beholds disappointed of their fond wishes Some lament that having once possessed the object of their desires it is ravished  from them by envious fortune and all complain that even their own vows though granted cannot give them happiness or relieve the anxiety of their distracted minds  LABOUR  SEE the hardy hunters rife from their downy couches shake off the slumbers that still weigh down their heavy eyelids and ere  Aurora  has yet covered the heavens with her flaming mantle hasten to the forest They leave behind in their own houses and in the neighbouring plains animals of every kind whose flesh furnishes the most delicious fare and which offer themselves to the fatal stroke Laborious man disdains so easy a purchase He seeks for a prey that hides itself from his search or flies from his pursuit or defends itself from his violence Having exerted in the chace every passion of the mind and every member of the body he then finds the charm of repose and with joy compares its pleasures to those of his engaging labours  SLOTH  IN vain do ye seek repose from beds of roses In vain do you hope for enjoyment from the most delicious wines or fruits your indolence itself becomes a fatigue your pleasure itself creates disgust The mind unexercised finds every delight insipid and loathsome and ere yet the body full  of noxious humours feels the torment of its multiplied diseases your nobler part is sensible of the invading poison and seeks in vain to relieve its anxiety by new pleasures which still augment the fatal malady  INDUSTRY  CAN vigorous industry give pleasure to the pursuit even of the most worthless prey which frequently escapes our toils And cannot the same industry render the cultivation of our minds the moderating of our passions the enlightening of our reason an agreeable occupation while we are everyday sensible of our progress and behold our inward features and countenance brightening incessantly with new charms Begin by curing yourself of this lethargic indolence the task is not difficult you need but taste the sweets of honest labour Proceed to learn the just value of every pursuit long study is not requisite compare though but for once the mind to the body virtue to fortune and glory to pleasure you will then perceive the advantages of industry you will then be sensible what are the proper objects of your industry  FORTUNE FICKLE  THE instability of fortune is a consideration not to be overlooked or neglected Happiness cannot possibly exist where there is no security and security can have no place where Fortune has any  dominion Though that unstable deity should not exert her rage against you the dread of it would still torment you would disturb your slumbers haunt your dreams and throw a damp on the jollity of your most delicious banquets  CHEARFULNESS  NO quality more readily communicates itself to all around than chearfulness because no one has a greater propensity to display itself in jovial talk and pleasant entertainment The flame spreads through the whole circle and the most sullen and morose are often caught by it That the melancholy hate the merry even though  Horace  says it I have some difficulty to allow because I have always observed that where the jollity is moderate and decent serious people are so much the more delighted as it dissipates the gloom with which they are commonly oppressed and gives them an unusual enjoyment  MEANNESS  WHEN a man can submit to the basest slavery in order to gain his ends fawn upon those who abuse him and degrade himself by intimacies and familiarities with undeserving inferiors it constitutes the vice we properly call Meanness A certain degree of generous pride or selfvalue is so requisite that the absence of it in the mind displeases after the same manner as the want of a  nose eye or any of the most material features of the face or members of the body View the picture which  Tacitus  draws of  Vitellius  fallen from empire prolonging his ignominy from a wretched love of life delivered over to the merciless rabble tossed buffeted and kicked about constrained by their holding a poniard under his chin to raise his head and expose himself to every contumely What abject infamy what low humiliation  LUXURY  LUXURY or a refinement on the pleasures and conveniences of life had long been supposed the source of every corruption in government and the immediate cause of faction sedition civil wars and the total loss of liberty it was therefore universally regarded as a vice and was an object of declamation to all satirists and severe moralists Those who prove or attempt to prove that such refinements rather tend to the increase of industry civility and arts regulate anew our moral as well as political sentiments and represent as laudable and innocent what had formerly been regarded as pernicious and blameable  Let us consider what we call vicious luxury No gratification however sensual can of itself be esteemed vicious a gratification is only vicious when it engrosses all a man's expence and leaves no ability for such acts of duty and generosity as are required by his situation and fortune Suppose  that he correct the vice and employ part of his expence in the education of his children in the support of his friends and in relieving the poor would any prejudice result to society On the contrary the same consumption would arise and that labour which at present is employed only in producing a slender gratification to one man would relieve the necessitous and bestow satisfaction on hundreds The same care and toil that raise a dish of pease at  Christmas  would give bread to a whole family during six months To say that without a vicious luxury the labour would not have been employed at all is only to say that there is some other defect in human nature such as indolence selfishness inattention to others for which luxury in some measure provides a remedy as one poison may be an antidote to another But virtue like wholesome food is better than poisons however corrected  BOOKS  THE good fortune of a book and that of a man are not the same The secret deceiving path of life which  Horace  talks of  fallentis semita vitae  may be the happiest lot of the one but is the greatest misfortune which the other can possibly fall into  It is with books as with women where a certain plainness of manner and of dress is more engaging than that glare of paint and airs and apparel  which may dazzle the eye but reaches not the affections  Terence  is a modest and bashful beauty to whom we grant every thing because he assumes nothing and whose purity and nature make a durable though not a violent impression  When we run over libraries what havock must we make If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or numberNo Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existenceNo Commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion  There is only one subject on which I am apt to distrust the judgment of females and that is concerning books of gallantry and devotion which they commonly affect as highflown as possible and most of them seem more delighted with the warmth than with the justness of the passion I mention gallantry and devotion as the same subject because in reality they become the same when treated in this manner and we may observe that they both depend upon the very same complexion As the fair sex have a great share of the tender and amorous disposition it perverts their judgment on this occasion and makes them be easily affected even by what has no propriety in the expression nor nature in the sentiment Mr  Addison  's elegant discourses of religion have no relish with them in comparison of books of mystic devotion and  Otway  's Tragedies are rejected for the rants of Mr  Dryden  SUPERSTITION  THE mind of man is subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions proceeding either from the unhappy situation of private or public affairs from ill health from a gloomy and melancholy disposition or from the concurrence of all these circumstances In such a state of mind infinite unknown evils are dreaded from unknown agents and where real objects of terror are wanting the soul active to its own prejudice and fostering its predominant inclination finds imaginary ones to whose power and malevolence it sets no limits As these enemies are entirely invisible and unknown the methods taken to appease them are equally unaccountable and consist in ceremonies observances mortifications sacrifices presents or in any practice however absurd or frivolous which either folly or knavery recommends to a blind and terrified credulity Weakness fear melancholy together with ignorance are therefore the true sources of superstition  THE SUBLIME  THE great charm of poetry consists in lively pictures of the sublime passions magnanimity  courage disdain of fortune or those of the tender affections love and friendship which warm the heart and diffuse over it similar sentiments and emotions and though all kinds of passion even the most disagreeable such as grief and anger are observed when excited by poetry to convey a satisfaction from a mechanism of nature not easy to be explained yet those more elevated or softer affections have a peculiar influence and please from more than one cause or principle not to mention that they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represented or communicate any esteem and affection for their character  And can it possibly be doubted that this talent itself of poets to move the passions this pathetic and sublime of sentiment is a very considerable merit and being inhanced by its extreme rarity may exalt the person possessed of it above every character of the age in which he lives The prudence address steadiness and benign government of  Augustus  adorned with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial crown rendered him but an unequal competitor for fame with  Virgil  who lays nothing in the opposite scale but the divine beauties of his poetical genius  DIOGENES AND PASCAL  THE foundation of  Diogenes'  conduct was an endeavour to render himself an independent being  as much as possible and to confine all his wants and desires and pleasures within himself and his own mind The aim of  Pascal  was to keep a perpetual sense of his dependence before his eyes and never to forget his numberless wants and infirmities The ancient supported himself by magnanimity oftentation pride and the idea of his own superiority above his fellow creatures The modern made constant profession of humility and abasement of the contempt and hatred of himself and endeavoured to attain these supposed virtues as far as they are attainable The austerities of the  Greek  were in order to inure himself to hardships and prevent his ever suffering Those of the  Frenchman  were embraced merely for their own sake and in order to suffer as much as possible The philosopher indulged himself in the most beastly pleasures even in public The saint refused himself the most innocent even in private The former thought it his duty to love his friends and to rail at them and reprove them and scold them The latter endeavoured to be absolutely indifferent towards his nearest relations and to love and speak well of his enemies The great object of  Diogenes'  wit was every kind of superstition that is every kind of religion known in his time the mortality of the soul was his standard principle and even his sentiments of a divine providence seem to have been licentious The most ridiculous superstitions directed  Pascal  's faith and practice and an extreme contempt of this life in comparison  of the future was the chief foundation of his conduct  INSPIRATION  There is a God within us  says Ovid  who breathes that divine fire by which we are animated  Poets in all ages have advanced this claim to inspiration There is not however any thing supernatural in the case Their fire is not kindled from heaven it only runs along the earth is caught from one breast to another and burns brightest where the materials are best prepared and most happily disposed  AGRICULTURE  THE most natural way of encouraging husbandry is first to excite other kinds of industry and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoyment This method is infallible and universal  MODERN INVENTIONS  OUR superior skill in mechanics the discovery of new worlds by which commerce has been so much enlarged the establishment of posts and the use of bills of exchange these seem all extremely useful to the encouragement of art industry and populousness Were we to strike off these what a check mould should we give to every kind  of business and labour and what multitudes of families would immediately perish from want and hunger  THE UNIVERSE  THERE is very little ground either from reason or observation to conclude the world eternal or incorruptible The continual and rapid motion of matter the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated the changes remarked in the heavens the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world and its passage by corruption or dissolution from one state or order to another It must therefore as well as each individual form which it contains have its infancy youth manhood and old age and it is probable that in all these variations man equally with every animal and vegetable will partake In the flourishing age of the world it may be expected that the human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body more prosperous health higher spirits longer life and a stronger inclination and power of generation but if the general system of things and human society of course have any such gradual revolutions they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition Stature and force of body length of life even courage and extent of genius seem hitherto to  have been naturally in all ages pretty much the same The arts and sciences indeed have flourished in one period and have decayed in another but at the time when they rose to greatest perfection among one people they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations and though they universally decayed in one age yet in a succeeding generation they again revived and diffused themselves over the world As far therefore as observation reaches there is no universal difference discernible in the human species and though it were allowed that the universe like an animal body had a natural progress from infancy to oldage yet as it must still be uncertain whether at present it be advancing to its point of perfection or declining from it we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature  WIT AND TASTE  NO one has ever been able to tell precisely what wit is and to shew why such a system of thought must be received under that denomination and such another rejected It is by taste alone we can decide concerning it nor are we possesed of any other standard by which we can form a judgment of this nature Now what is this taste from which true and false wit in a manner receive their being and without which no thought can have a title to either of these denominations It is plainly nothing but a sensation of pleasure from true  wit and of disgust from false without our being able to tell the reasons of that satisfaction or uneasiness The power of exciting these opposite sensations is therefore the very essence of true or false wit and consequently the cause of that vanity or mortification which arises from one or the other  MAXIMS  NO man will accept of low profits where he can have high interest and no man will accept of low interest where he can have high profits  Many events happen in society which are not to be accounted for by general rules Who could imagine that the  Romans  who lived freely with their women should be very indifferent about music and esteem dancing infamous while the  Greeks  who never almost saw a woman but in their own houses were continually piping singing and dancing  It is an infallible consequence of all industrious professions to beget frugality and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure  Lawyers and physicians beget no industry and it is even at the expence of others they acquire their riches so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fellowcitizens as fast as they increase their own  Our regard to a character with others seems to arise only from a care of preserving a character with ourselves and to attain this end we find it necessary to prop our tottering judgment on the corresponding approbation of mankind  The more unhappy another is the more happy do we ourselves appear in our own conception  Men always consider the sentiments of others in their judgment of themselves  The suffrage of those who are shy and backward in giving praise is attended with an additional relish and enjoyment  A generous and noble character affords a satisfaction even in the survey and when presented to us though only in a poem or fable never fails to charm and delight  We may change the names of things but their nature and operation on the understanding never change  General observations treasured up by a course of experience give us the clue of human nature and teach us to unravel all its intricacies  Experience only teaches how one event constantly follows another without instructing us in the secret  connexion which binds them together and renders them inseparable  From causes which appear similar we expect similar effects This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions  Where a great man is delicate in his choice of favourites every one courts with greater earnestness his countenance and protection  The sweetest and most inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and learning and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way or open up any new prospect ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind  Obscurity indeed is painful to the mind as well as to the eye but to bring light from obscurity by whatever labour must needs be delightful and rejoicing  All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in various attitudes and situations and inspire us with different sentiments of praise or blame admiration or ridicule according to the qualities of the object which they set before us  As a stream necessarily follows the several inclinations of the ground on which it runs so are the ignorant and thougthless actuated by their natural propensities  The catching of flies like  Domitian  if it give more pleasure is preferable to the hunting of wild beasts like  William Rufus  or conquering of kingdoms like  Alexander  When by my will alone I can stop the blood as it runs with impetuosity along its canals then may I hope to change the course of my sentiments and passions  The ultimate author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world who first bestowed motion on this immense machine and placed all beings in that particular position whence every subsequent event by an inevitable necessity must result  As a man who fired a mine is answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employed be long or short so wherever a continued chain of necessary causes is fixed that being who produces the first is likewise the author of all the rest and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong to them  HUMAN NATURE ALWAYS THE SAME  RECORDS of wars intrigues factions and revolutions are so many collections or experiments by which the politician or moral philosopher fixes the principles of his science in the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes  acquainted with the nature of plants minerals and other external objects by the experiments which he forms concerning them Nor are the earth water and other elements examined by  Arisiotle  and  Hippocrates  more like to those which at present lie under our observation than the men described by  Polybius  and  Tacitus  are to those who now govern the world  PUBLIC SPIRIT  A MAN who loves only himself without regard to friendship and desert merits the severest blame and the man who is only susceptible of friendship without public spirit or a regard to the community is deficient in the most material of virtues  NEUTRALITY  SOLON  was no very cruel though perhaps an unjust legislator who punished neuters in civil wars and few I believe would in such cases incur the penalty were their affection and discourse allowed sufficient to absolve them No selfishness and scarce any philosophy have therefore sufficient to support a total coolness and indifference and he must be more or less than man who kindles not in the common blaze  EUROPE  THE government of the  Germans  and that of all the Northern nations who established themselves  on the ruins of  Rome  was always extremely free and those fierce people accustomed to independence and inured to arms were more guided by persuasion than authority in the submission which they paid their princes The military despotism which had taken place in the  Roman  empire and which previously to the irruption of these conquerors had sunk the genius of men and destroyed every noble principle of science and virtue was unable to resist the vigorous efforts of a free people and  Europe  as from a new epoch rekindled her ancient spirit and shook off the base servitude to arbitrary will and authority under which it had so long laboured The free constitutions then established however impaired by the encroachments of succeeding princes still preserve an air of independence and legal administration which distinguish the  European  nations and if that part of the globe maintain sentiments of liberty honour equity and valour superior to the rest of mankind it owes these advantages chiefly to the seeds implanted by those generous barbarians  Europe  is shared out mostly into great monarchies and such parts of it as are divided into small territories are commonly governed by absolute princes who ruin their people by a mimicry of the greater monarchs in the splendour of their court and number of their forces  Swisserland  alone and  Holland  resemble the ancient republics and though the former is far from possesing any  advantage either of soil climate or commerce yet the numbers of people with which it abounds notwithstanding their enlisting themselves into every service in  Europe  prove sufficiently the advantages of their political institutions  THE ANGLOSAXONS  THESE we must conceive were very little removed from the original state of nature the social state among them was more martial than civil they had chiefly in view the means of attack or defence against public enemies not those of protection against fellowcitizens their possessions were so slender and so equal that they were not exposed to great dangers and the natural bravery of the people made every man trust to himself and to his particular friends for his defence or vengeance This defect in the political union drew much closer the knot of particular confederacies An insult upon any man was regarded by all his relations and associates as a common injury they were bound by honour as well as by a sense of general interest to revenge his death or any violence which he had suffered They retaliated on the aggressor by like violences and if he was protected as was natural and usual by his own clan the quarrel was spread still wider and bred endless disorder in the nation  COMMERCE AND LEARNING  'TIS more easy to account for the rise and progress of commerce in any kingdom than for that of learning and a state that should apply itself to the encouragement of the one would be much more assured of success than one which should cultivate the other Avarice or the desire of gain is an universal passion that operates at all times in all places and upon all persons but curiosity or the love of knowledge has but a very limited influence and requires youth leisure education genius and example to make it govern any person You will never want booksellers while there are buyers of books but there may frequently be readers where there are no authors Multitudes of people necessity and liberty have begot commerce in  Holland  but study and application have not produced any eminent writers  MONEY  MONEY never gathers into large stocks or sums which can be lent at interest It is dispersed into numberless hands who either squander it in idle shew and magnificence or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life Commerce alone assembles it from the industry which it begets and the frugality which it inspires  I should as soon dread that all our springs and rivers should be exhausted as that money should  abandon a kingdom where there are people and industry Let us carefully preserve these latter advantages and we need never be apprehensive of losing the former  WAR  WAR has its laws as well as peace and even that sportive kind of war carried on among wrestlers boxers cudgelplayers gladiators is regulated by fixed principles  I must confess when I see princes and states fighting and quarreling amidst their debts funds and public mortgages it always brings to my mind a match of cudgelplay fought in a chinashop How can it be expected that sovereigns will spare a species of property which is pernicious to themselves and to the public when they have so little compassion on lives and properties that are useful to both  INFATUATION  MANKIND are in all ages caught by the same baits The same tricks played over and over again still trepan them The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny flattery to treachery standing armies to arbitrary government and the glory of God to the temporal interest of the clergy The fear of an everlasting destruction of credit allowing it to be an evil is a needless bugbear  A prudent man in reality would rather lend to the public immediately after they had taken a spunge to their debts than at present as much as an opulent knave even though one could not force him to pay is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt for the former in order to carry on business may find it his interest to discharge his debts where they are not exorbitant the latter has it not in his power  THE NATIONAL FUNDS  WE have always found where a government has mortgaged all its revenue that it necessarily sinks into a state of languor inactivity and impotence  The greatest part of public stock being always in the hands of idle people who live on their revenue our funds give great encouragement to an useless and inactive life  As foreigners possess a great share of our national funds they render the public in a manner tributary to them and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our industry  LONDON  IT is a question whether it be for the public interest that so many privileges should be conferred on  London  which has already arrived at such an  enormous size and seems still increasing Some men are apprehensive of the consequences For my own part I cannot forbear thinking that though the head is undoubtedly too large for the body yet that great city is so happily situated that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom There is more difference between the prices of all provisions in  Paris  and  Languedoc  than between those in  London  and  Yorkshire  The immense greatness indeed of  London  under a government which admits not of discretionary power renders the people factious mutinous seditious and even perhaps rebellious But to this evil the national debts themselves tend to provide a remedy The first visible irruption or even immediate danger of public disorders must alarm all the stockholders whose property is the most precarious of any and will make them fly to the support of government whether menaced by  Jacobitish  violence or democratical frenzy  TRADE  ANY great blow given to trade whether by injudicious taxes or by other accidents throws the whole system of government into confusion  INTEREST  INTEREST is the barometer of the state and its lowness is a sign almost infallible of the flourishing  condition of a people It proves the increase of industry and its prompt circulation through the whole state little inferior to a demonstration And though perhaps it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind by throwing so many stocks out of trade it must be attended with such misery and want of employment in the poor that besides its short duration it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other  A REFLECTION  SUPPOSE the public once fairly brought to that condition to which it is hastening with such amazing rapidity suppose the land to be taxed eighteen or nineteen shillings in the pound for it can never bear the whole twenty suppose all the excises and customs to be screwed up to the utmost which the nation can bear without entirely losing its commerce and industry and suppose that all these funds are mortgaged to perpetuity and that the wit and invention of all our projectors can find no new imposition which may serve as the foundation of a new loan and let us consider the necessary consequences of this situation Though the imperfect state of our political knowledge and the narrow capacities of men make it difficult to foretell the effects which will result from any untried measure the seeds of ruin are here scattered with such profusion as not to escape the eye of the most careless observer  PUBLIC BANKRUPTCY  IT has been computed that all the creditors of the public natives and foreigners amount only to seventeen thousand These make a figure at present on their income but in case of a public bankruptcy would in an instant become the lowest as well as the most wretched of the people The dignity and authority of the landed gentry and nobility is much better rooted and would render the contention very unequal if ever we come to that extremity One would incline to assign to this event a very near period such as half a century had not our fathers prophecies of this kind been found fallacious by the duration of our public credit so much beyond all reasonable expectation When the astrologers in  France  were every year foretelling the death of  Henry  IV "these fellows" says he "must be right at last"  When the nation becomes heartily sick of her debts and is cruelly oppressed by them some daring projector may arise with visionary schemes for their discharge and as public credit will begin by that time to be a little frail the least touch will destroy it as happened in  France  during the regency and in this manner  it will die of the doctor  Let the time come and surely it will come when the new funds created for the exigencies of the year are not subscribed to and raise not the  money projected Suppose either that the cash of the nation is exhausted or that our faith which has been hitherto so ample begins to fail us suppose that in this distress the nation is threatened with an invasion a rebellion is suspected or broken out at home a squadron cannot be equipped for want of pay victuals or repairs or even a foreign subsidy cannot be advanced What must a prince or minister do in such an emergence The right of selfpreservation is unalienable in every individual much more in every community and the folly of our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who first contracted debt or what is more than that of those who trusted or continue to trust this security if these statesmen have the means of safety in their hands and do not employ them The funds created and mortgaged will by that time bring in a large yearly revenue sufficient for the defence and security of the nation money is perhaps lying in the Exchequer ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest necessity calls fear urges reason exhorts compassion alone exclaims the money will immediately be seized for the current service under the most solemn protestations perhaps of being immediately replaced But no more is requisite The whole fabric already tottering falls to the ground and buries thousands in its ruins  Here thousands are sacrificed to the safety of millions but we are not without danger that millions  may be sacrificed for ever to the temporary safety of thousands Our popular government perhaps will render it difficult or dangerous for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient as that of a voluntary bankruptcy And though the House of Lords be altogether composed of proprietors of land and the House of Commons chiefly and consequently neither of them can be supposed to have great property in the funds yet the connections of the members may be so great with the proprietors as to render them more tenacious of public faith than prudence policy or even justice strictly speaking requires And perhaps too our soreign enemies may be so politic as to discover that our safety lies in despair and may not therefore shew the danger open and barefaced till it be inevitable The balance of power in  Europe  our grandfathers our fathers and we have all esteemed too unequal to be preserved without our attention and assistance But our children weary of the struggle and fettered with incumbrances may sit down secure and see their neighbours oppressed and conquered till at last they themselves and their creditors lie both at the mercy of the conqueror And this may properly enough be denominated the violent death of our public credit  WHIGGISM  THE limitations and restraints of civil government and a legal constitution may be defended  either from reason which reflecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature teaches that no man can safely be trusted with unlimited authority or from experience and history which inform us of the enormous abuses that ambition in every age and country has been found to make of so imprudent a confidence  FEMALE INTRIGUE  EXCEPT the fabulous stories of an  Helen  and a  Clytemnestra  there scarcely is an instance of any event in the  Greek  history which proceeded from the intrigues of women  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS  HOW much would it have surprised such a genius as  Cicero  or  Tacitus  to have been told that in a future age a very regular system of mixed government would take place where the authority was so distributed that one rank whenever it pleased might swallow up all the rest and engross the whole power of the constitution Such a government they would say will not be a mixed government for so great is the natural ambition of men that they are never satisfied with power and if one order of men by pursuing its own interest can usurp upon every other order it will certainly do so and render itself as far as possible absolute and uncontroulable But in this opinion experience shews they would have been mistaken for this is actually the case  with the  British  constitution The share of power allotted by our constitution to the House of Commons is so great that it absolutely commands all the other parts of the government  OPINION  THERE has been a sudden and sensible change in the opinions of men within these last fifty years by the progress of learning and of liberty Most people in this island have divested themselves of all superstitious reverence to names and authority the clergy have much lost their credit their pretensions and doctrines have been ridiculed and even religion can scarcely support itself in the world The mere name of King commands little respect and to talk of a King as God's vicegerent on earth or to give him any of those magnificent titles which formerly dazzled mankind would but excite laughter in every one Though the Crown by means of its large revenue may maintain its authority in times of tranquillity upon private interest and influence yet as the least shock or convulsion must break all these interests to pieces the royal power being no longer supported by the settled principles and opinions of men will immediately dissolve Had men been in the same disposition at the Revolution as they are at present monarchy would have run a great risque of being entirely lost in this island  USURPATION  A MAN possessed of usurped power can set no bounds to his pretensions His par  iz  ns have liberty to hope for every thing in his favour his enemies provoke his ambition with his fears by the violence of their opposition and the government being thrown into a ferment every corrupted humour in the state naturally gathers to him  THE INFLUENCE OF THE CROWN  UPON a moderate computation there are near three millions at the disposal of the Crown The civil list amounts to near a million the collection of all taxes to another and the employments in the army and navy together with ecclesiastical preferments to above a third million an enormous sum and what may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth part of the whole income and labour of the kingdom When we add to this great property the increasing luxury of the nation our proneness to corruption together with the great power and prerogatives of the Crown and command of military force there is no one but must despair of being able without extraordinary efforts to support our free government much longer under these disadvantages  The Crown has so many offices at its disposal that when assisted by the honest and disinterested  part of the house it will always command the resolutions of the whole so far at least as to preserve the ancient constitution from danger We may give to this influence what name we please We may call it by the invidious appellation of Corruption and Dependence but some degree and some kind of it are inseparable from the very nature of the constitution and necessary to the preservation of our mixed government  PRINCES  ALWAYS to throw without distinction the blame of all disorders upon the Prince would introduce a fatal error in politics and serve as a perpetual apology for treason and rebellion as if the turbulency of the great and madness of the people were not equally with the tyranny of Princes an evil incident to human society and no less to be guarded against in every wellregulated constitution  ALLEGIANCE  To whom is allegiance due and who are our legal sovereigns This question is often the most difficult of any and liable to infinite discussions When people are so happy that they can answer Our present sovereign who inherits in a direct line from ancestors that have governed us for many ages this answer admits of no reply even though historians in tracing up to the remotest antiquity  the origin of that royal family may find as commonly happens that its first authority was derived from usurpation and violence It is confessed that private justice or the abstinence from the properties of others is a most cardinal virtue yet reason tells us that there is no property in durable objects such as lands or houses when carefully examined in passing from hand to hand but must in some period have been founded in fraud and injustice The necessities of human society neither in public nor private life will allow of such an accurate enquiry  MONARCHIES  ENORMOUS monarchies are probably destructive to human nature in their progress in their continuance and even in their downfall which never can be very distant from their establishment The military genius which aggrandised the monarchy soon leaves the court the capital and the centre of such a government while the wars are carried on at a great distance and interest so small a part of the state The ancient nobility whose affections attach them to the sovereign live all at court and never will accept of military employments which would carry them to remote and barbarous frontiers where they are distant both from their pleasure and their fortune The arms of the state must therefore be in trusted to mercenary strangers without zeal without attachment  without honour ready on every occasion to turn them against the prince and join each desperate malcontent who offers pay and plunder This is the necessary progress of human affairs Thus human nature checks itself in its airy elevation Thus ambition blindly labours for the destruction of the conqueror of his family and of every thing near and dear to him  THE ORIGIN OF INTEREST  HIGH interest arises from three circumstances a great demand for borrowing little riches to supply that demand and great profits arising from commerce and these circumstances are a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry not of the scarcity of gold and silver Low interest on the other hand proceeds from the three opposite circumstances a small demand for borrowing great riches to supply that demand and small profits arising from commerce and these circumstances are all connected together and proceed from the increase of industry and commerce not of gold and silver  THE FLUCTUATION OF RICHES  IN five hundred years the posterity of those now in the coaches and of those upon the boxes will probably have changed places without affecting the public by these revolutions  THE ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT  THE people if we trace government to its first origin in the woods and deserts are the source of all power and jurisdiction and voluntarily for the sake of peace and order abandoned their native liberty and received laws from their equal and companion The conditions upon which they were willing to submit were either expressed or were so clear and obvious that it might well be deemed superfluous to express them If this then be the original contract it cannot be denied that all government is at first founded on a contract and that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed intirely by that principle In vain are we asked in what records this charter of our liberties is registered It was not writ in parchment nor yet on leaves or barks of trees it preceded the use of writing and all other civilised arts of life  THE REVOLUTION  THE Revolution forms a new epoch in the constitution and was attended with consequences much more advantageous to the people than the barely freeing them from a bad administration By deciding many important questions in favour of liberty and still more by that great precedent of deposing one king and establishing a new family it gave such an ascendant to popular principles  as has put the nature of the  English  constitution beyond all controversy And it may safely be affirmed without any danger of exaggeration that we in this island have ever since enjoyed if not the best system of government at least the most intire system of liberty that ever was known among mankind  THE DISPENSING POWER IN THE CROWN  MEN deemed a dispensing power to be in fact the same with a repealing power and they could not conceive that less authority was requisite to repeal than to enact any statute If one penal law was dispensed with any other might undergo the same fate and by what principle could even the laws which define property be afterwards secured from violation The Test act had ever been conceived the great barrier of the established religion under a popish successor as such it had been insisted on by the parliament as such granted by the king as such during the debates with regard to the exclusion recommended by the chancellor by what magic what chicane of law is it now annihilated and rendered of no validity These questions were every where asked and men straitened by precedents and decisions of great authority were reduced either to question the antiquity of this prerogative itself or to assert that even the practice of five centuries could not bestow on it sufficient  authority It was not considered that the present difficulty or seeming absurdity had proceeded from late innovations introduced into the government Ever since the beginning of this century the parliament had with the most laudable zeal been acquiring powers and establishing principles favourable to law and liberty the authority of the crown had been limited in many important particulars and penal statutes were often calculated to secure the constitution against the attempts of ministers as well as to preserve general peace and repress crimes and immoralities A prerogative however derived from very ancient and almost uniform practice the dispensing power still remained or was supposed to remain with the crown sufficient in an instant to overturn this whole fabric and to throw down all the fences of the constitution If this prerogative which carries on the face of it such strong symptoms of an absolute authority in the crown had yet in ancient times subsisted with some degree of liberty in the subject this fact only proves that scarce any human government much less one erected in rude and barbarous times is entirely consistent and uniform in all its parts But to expect that the dispensing power could in any degree be rendered compatible with those accurate and regular limitations which had of late been established and which the people were determined to maintain was a vain hope and though men knew not on what principles they could deny that  prerogative they saw that if they would preserve their laws and constitution there was an absolute necessity for denying or at least for abolishing it The Revolution alone which soon succeeded happily put an end to all these disputes by means of it a more uniform edifice was at last erected the monstrous inconsistence so visible between the ancient  Gothic  parts of the fabric and the recent plans of liberty was fully corrected and to their mutual felicity king and people were finally taught to know their proper limits and boundaries  OBEDIENCE  OBEDIENCE or subjection becomes so familiar that most men never make any enquiry about its origin or cause more than about the principles of gravity resistance or the most universal laws of nature or if curiosity ever move them as soon as they learn that they themselves and their ancestors have for several ages or for time imme+morial been subject to such a government or such a family they immediately acquiesce and acknowledge their obligation to allegiance Were you to preach in most parts of the world that political connexions are founded altogether on voluntary consent or a mutual promise the magistrate would soon imprison you as seditious for loosening the ties of obedience if your friends did not before shut you up as delirious for advancing such absurdities  RESISTANCE  IF ever on any occasion it were laudable to conceal truth from the populace it must be confessed that the doctrine of resistance affords such an example and that all speculative reasoners ought to observe with regard to this principle the same cautious silence which the laws in every species of government have ever prescribed to themselves Government is instituted in order to restrain the fury and injustice of the people and being always founded on opinion not on force it is dangerous to weaken by these speculations the reverence which the multitude owe to authority and to instruct them beforehand that the case can ever happen when they may be freed from their duty of allegiance Or should it be found impossible to restrain the licence of human disquisitions it must be acknowledged that the doctrine of obedience ought alone to be inculcated and that the exceptions which are very rare ought seldom or never to be mentioned in popular reasonings and discourses Nor is there any danger that mankind by this prudent reserve should universally degenerate into a state of abject servitude Where the exception really occurs even though it be not previously expected and descanted on it must from its very nature be so obvious and undisputed as to remove all doubt and overpower the restraint however great imposed by teaching the general doctrine of obedience But between  resisting a prince and dethroning him there is a very wide interval and the abuses of power which can warrant the latter violence are much greater and more enormous than those which will justify the former History however supplies us with examples even of this kind and the reality of this supposition though for the future it ought ever to be little looked for must by all candid enquirers be acknowledged in the past But between the dethroning a prince and punishing him there is another very wide interval and it were not strange if even men of the most enlarged thought should question whether human nature could ever in any monarch reach that height of depravity as to warrant in revolted subjects this last act of extraordinary jurisdiction That illusion if it be an illusion which teaches us to pay a sacred regard to the persons of princes is so salutary that to dissipate it by the formal trial and punishment of a sovereign will have more pernicious effects upon the people than the example of justice can be supposed to have a beneficent influence upon princes by checking their career of tyranny 'Tis dangerous also by these examples to reduce princes to despair or bring matters to such extremities against persons endowed with great power as to leave them no resource but in the most violent and most sanguinary counsels This general position being established it must however be observed that no reader almost of any party or principle was ever shocked when he read in ancient  history that the  Roman  senate voted  Nero  their absolute sovereign to be a public enemy and even without trial condemned him to the severest and most ignominious punishment such a punishment as the meanest  Roman  citizen was by the laws exempted from  THE EUTHANASIA OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION  AS one kind of death may be preferable to another it may be enquired whether it be more desirable for the  British  constitution to terminate in a popular government or in absolute monarchy Here I would frankly declare that though liberty be preferable to slavery in almost every case yet I should rather wish to see an absolute monarchy than a republic in this island for let us consider what kind of republic we have reason to expect The question is not concerning any fine imaginary republic of which a man may form a plan in his closet There is no doubt but a popular government may be imagined more perfect than absolute monarchy or even than our present constitution But what reason have we to expect that any such government will ever be established in  Britain  upon the dissolution of our monarchy If any single person acquire power enough to take our constitution to pieces and put it up anew he is really an absolute monarch and we have already had an instance of this kind sufficient to convince us that such a person will never resign his power  or establish any free government Matters therefore must be trusted to their natural progress and operation and the House of Commons according to its present constitution must be the only legislator in such a popular government The inconveniences attending such a situation of affairs present themselves by thousands If the House of Commons in such a case ever dissolve itself which is not to be expected we may look for a civil war every election If it continue itself we shall suffer all the tyranny of a faction subdivided into new factions And as such violent government cannot long subsist we shall at last after many convulsions and civil wars find repose in absolute monarchy which it would have been happier for us to have established peaceably from the beginning Absolute monarchy therefore is the easiest death the true  Euthanasia  of the  British  constitution  THE DOWNFALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE  THE period was now come when that enormous fabric of the  Roman  empire which had diffused slavery and oppression together with peace and civility on so considerable a part of the globe was approaching towards its final dissolution  Italy  and the centre of the empire removed during so many ages from all concern in the wars had entirely lost the military spirit and were peopled by an enervated race equally disposed to submit to a foreign yoke or to the tyranny of their  own rulers The emperors found themselves obliged to recruit their legions from the frontier provinces where the genius of war though languishing was not totally extinct and these mercenary forces careless of laws and civil institutions established a military government no less dangerous to the sovereign than to the people The farther progress of the same disorders introduced the bordering barbarians into the service of the  Romans  and those fierce nations having now added discipline and skill to their native bravery could no longer be restrained by the impotent policy of the emperors who were accustomed to employ the one in the destruction of the other Sensible of their own force and allured by the prospect of so rich a prize the Northern barbarians in the reign of  Arcadius  and  Honorius  assailed at once all the frontiers of the  Roman  empire and having first satiated their avidity by plunder began to think of fixing a settlement in the wasted provinces The more distant barbarians who occupied the deserted habitations of the former advanced in their acquisitions and pressed with their incumbent weight the  Roman  state already unequal to the load which it sustained Instead of arming the people in their own defence the emperors recalled all the distant legions in whom alone they could repose confidence and collected the whole military force for the defence of the capital and centre of the empire The necessity of selfpreservation had superseded the ambition of  power and the ancient point of honour of never contracting the limits of the empire could no longer be attended to in this desperate extremity  BRITAIN AND ROME  WE are to consider the  Roman  government under the emperors as a mixture of despotism and liberty where the despotism prevailed and the  English  government as a mixture of the same kind where the liberty predominates The consequences are such as may be expected from those mixed forms of government which beget a mutual watchfulness and jealousy The  Roman  emperors were many of them the most frightful monsters that ever disgraced human nature and it is evident their cruelty was chiefly excited by their jealousy and by their observing that all the great men of  Rome  bore with impatience the dominion of a family which but a little before was no way superior to their own On the other hand as the republican part of the government prevails in  England  though with a great mixture of monarchy it is obliged for its own preservation to maintain a watchful jealousy over the magistrates to remove all discretionary powers and to secure every one's life and fortune by general and inflexible laws no action must be deemed a crime but what the law has plainly determined to be such no crime must be imputed to a man but from a legal proof before his judges and even these judges must be  his fellow subjects who are obliged by their own interest to have a watchful eye over the incroachments and violence of the ministers From these causes it proceeds that there is as much liberty and even perhaps licentiousness in  Britain  as there were formerly slavery and tyranny in  Rome  RELIGION  The universal propensity to believe in invisible intelligent power if not an original instinct being at least a general attendant of human nature may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp which the divine workman has set upon his work and nothing can surely more dignify mankind than to be thus selected from all other parts of the creation and to bear the image and impression of the universal Creator But consult this image as it appears in the popular religions of the worldHow is the Deity disfigured in our representations of him What caprice absurdity and immorality are attributed to him How much is he degraded even below the character which we should naturally in common life ascribe to a man of sense and virtue  What a noble privilege is it of human reason to attain the knowledge of the Supreme Being and from the visible works of nature be enabled to infer so sublime a principle as its Supreme Creator But turn the reverse of the medal Survey  most nations and most ages Examine the religious principles which have in fact prevailed in the world you will scarcely be persuaded that they are any thing but sick men's dreams or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape than the serious positive dogmatical asseverations of a being who dignifies himself with the name of rational  Hear the verbal protestations of all men nothing so certain as their religious tenets Examine their lives you will scarcely think that they repose the smallest confidence in them  The greatest and truest zeal gives us no security against hypocrisy The most open impiety is attended with a secret dread and compunction  No theological absurdities so glaring that they have not sometimes been embraced by men of the greatest and most cultivated understanding No religious precepts so rigorous that they have not been adopted by the most voluptuous and abandoned of men  What so pure as some of the morals included in some theological systems What so corrupt as some of the practices to which these systems give rise  The comfortable views exhibited by the belief of futurity are ravishing and delightful but how quickly vanish on the appearance of its terrors which keep a more firm and durable possession of the human mind  A CHARACTER  THE uncertainty of their life makes soldiers lavish and generous as well as brave their idleness together with the large societies which they form in camps or garrisons incline them to pleasure and gallantry by their frequent change of company they acquire goodbreeding and openness of behaviour being employed only against a public and an open enemy they become candid honest and undesigning and as they use more the labour of the body than that of the mind they are commonly thoughtless and ignorant  ANOTHER  It is a trite but not altogether a false maxim that priests of all religions are the same and though the character of the profession will not in every instance prevail over the personal character yet is it sure always to predominate with the greater number As chymists observe that spirits when raised to a certain height are all the same from whatever materials they be extracted so these men being elevated above humanity acquire a uniform character which is entirely their  own and which in my opinion is generally speaking not the most amiable that is to be met with in human society Most men are ambitious but the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied by excelling in their particular profession and thereby promoting the interest of society The ambition of the clergy can often be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds and having got what  Archimedes  only wanted another world on which he could fix his engines no wonder they move this world at their pleasure  SIR ISAAC NEWTON  IN  Newton  this island may boast of having produced the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species Cautious in admitting no principles but such as were founded on experiment but resolute to adopt every such principle however new or unusual from modesty ignorant of his superiority above the rest of mankind and thence less careful to accommodate his reasonings to common apprehensions more anxious to merit than acquire same he was from these causes long unknown to the world but his reputation at last broke out with a lustre which scarce any writer during his own lifetime had ever before attained While  Newton  seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of Nature he shewed at the same time  the imperfections of the mechanical Philosophy and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that obscurity in which they ever did and ever will remain  LORD FALKLAND  BEFORE assembling the present parliament this man devoted to the pursuits of learning and to the society of all the polite and elegant had enjoyed himself in every pleasure which a fine genius a generous disposition and an opulent fortune could afford Called into public life he stood foremost in all attacks on the exorbitant prerogative of the crown and displayed that masculine eloquence and undaunted love of liberty which from his intimate acquaintance with the sublime spirits of antiquity he had greedily imbibed When civil convulsions proceeded to extremity and it became requisite for him to chuse his side he tempered the ardour of his zeal and embraced the defence of those limited powers which remained to monarchy and which he deemed necessary for the support of the  English  constitution Still anxious however for his country he seems to have dreaded the too prosperous success of his own party as much as of the enemy and among his intimate friends often after a deep silence and frequent sighs he would with a sad accent reiterate the word  peace  In excuse for the too free exposing of his person which seemed unsuitable in a secretary of state he alledged that it  became him to be more active than other men in all hazardous enterprises lest his impatience for peace might bear the imputation of cowardice or pusillanimity From the commencement of the war his natural chearfulness and vivacity became clouded and even his usual attention to dress required by his birth or station gave way to a negligence which was easily observable On the morning of the battle in which he fell he had shewn some care for the adorning his person and gave for a reason that the enemy should not find his body in any slovenly indecent situation "I am weary" subjoined he "of the times and foresee much misery to my country but believe that I shall be out of it are night"  ALFRED  THE merit of this prince both in private and public life may with advantage be set in opposition to that of any monarch or citizen which the annals of any nation or any age can present to us He seems indeed to be the complete model of that perfect character which under the denomination of a sage or wise man the philosophers have been fond of delineating rather as a fiction of their imagination than in hopes of ever seeing it reduced to practice so happily were all his virtues tempered together so justly were they blended and so powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its proper bounds He knew how  to conciliate the boldest enterprise with the coolest moderation the most obstinate perseverance with the easiest flexibility the most severe justice with the greatest lenity the most vigorous command with the greatest affability of deportment the highest capacity and inclination for science with the most shining talents for action His civil and military virtues are almost equally the objects of our admiration excepting only that the former being more rare among princes as well as more useful seem chiefly to challenge our applause Nature also as if desirous that so bright a production of her skill mould be set in the fairest light had bestowed on him all bodily accomplishments vigour of limbs dignity of shape and air and a pleasant engaging and open countenance Fortune alone by throwing him into that barbarous age deprived him of historians worthy to transmit his fame to posterity and we wish to see him delineated in more lively colours and with more particular strokes that we may at least perceive some of those small specks and blemishes from which as a man it is impossible he could be entirely exempted  THE IRISH MASSACRE  THE  Irish  every where intermingled with the  English  needed but a hint from their leaders and priests to begin hostilities against a people whom they hated on account of their religion and envied for their riches and prosperity The houses cattle  goods of the unwary  English  were first seized Those who heard of the commotion in their neighbourhood instead of deserting their habitations and flocking together for mutual protection remained at home in hopes of defending their property and fell thus separately into the hands of their enemies After rapacity had fully exerted itself cruelty and the most barbarous that ever in any nation was known or heard of began its operations An universal massacre commenced of the  English  now defenceless and passively resigned to their inhuman foes No age no sex no condition was spared The wise weeping for her butchered husband and embracing her helpless children was pierced with them and perished by the same stroke The old the young the vigorous the infirm underwent a like fate and were confounded in one common ruin In vain did flight save from the first assault Destruction was every where let loose and met the hunted victims at every turn In vain was recourse had to relations to companions to friends All connection was dissolved and death was dealt by that hand from which protection was implored and expected Without provocation without opposition the astonished  English  living in profound peace and full security were massacred by their nearest neighbours with whom they had long upheld a continued intercourse of kindness and good offices  But death was the lightest punishment inflicted by those more than barbarous savages all the tortures which wanton cruelty could devise all the lingering pains of body the anguish of mind the agonies of despair could not satiate revenge exacted without injury and cruelty derived from no cause To enter into particulars would shock the least delicate humanity Such enormities though attested by undoubted evidence appear almost incredible Depraved nature even perverted religion though encouraged by the utmost licence reach not to such a pitch of ferocity unless the pity inherent in human breasts by that contagion of example which transports men beyond all the usual motives of conduct and behaviour be annihilated  The weaker sex themselves naturally tender to their own sufferings and compassionate to those of others here emulated their more robust companions in the practice of every cruelty Even children taught by the example and encouraged by the exhortation of their parents assayed their feeble blows on the dead carcases or defenceless children of the  English  The very avarice of the  Irish  was not a sufficient restraint to their cruelty Such was their frenzy that the cattle which they had seized and by rapine had made their own yet because they bore the name of  English  were wantonly slaughtered or when covered with wounds turned loose into the woods and deserts  The stately buildings or commodious habitations of the planters as if upbraiding the sloth and ignorance of the natives were consumed with sire or laid level with the ground And where the miserable owners shut up in their houses and preparing for defence perished in the flames together with their wives and children a double triumph was afforded to these insulting butchers  If any where a number assembled together and assuming courage from despair were resolved to sweeten death by a revenge of their assassins they were disarmed by capitulations and promises of safety confirmed by the most solemn oaths but no sooner had they surrendered than the rebels with  equal to their cruelty made them share the fate of their unhappy countrymen  Others more ingenious still in their barbarity tempted their prisoners by the fond love of life to imbrue their hands in the blood of friends brothers parents and having thus rendered them accomplices in their guilt gave them that death which they sought to shun by deserving it  Amidst all these enormities the sacred name of religion resounded on every side not to stop the hands of these savages but to enforce their blows and to steel their hearts against every movement of human or social sympathy The  English  as heretics abhorred of God and detestable to all holy  men were marked out by the priests for slaughter and of all actions to rid the world of these declared enemies to Catholic faith and piety was represented as the most meritorious Nature which in that rude people was sufficiently inclined to atrocious deeds was farther stimulated by precept and national prejudices impoisoned by those aversions more deadly and incurable which arose from an enraged superstition While death finished the sufferings of each victim the bigoted assassins with joy and exultation still echoed in his expiring ears that these agonies were but the commencement of torments infinite and eternal  From  Ulster  the flames of rebellion diffused themselves in an instant over the other three provinces of  Ireland  In all places death and slaughter were not uncommon though the  Irish  in these other provinces pretended to act with more moderation and humanity but cruel and barbarous was their humanity Not contented with expelling the  English  their houses with despoiling them of their goodly manors with wasting their cultivated fields they stripped them of their very clothes and turned them out naked and defenceless to all the severities of the season The heavens themselves as if conspiring against that unhappy people were armed with cold and tempest unusual to the climate and executed what the merciless sword of the barbarians had left unfinished  The roads were covered with crouds of naked  English  hastening towards  Dublin  and the other cities which yet remained in the hands of their countrymen The feeble age of children the tender sex of women soon sunk under the multiplied rigours of cold and hunger Here the husband bidding a final adieu to his expiring family envied them that fate which he himself expected so soon to share there the son having long supported his aged parent with reluctance obeyed his last commands and abandoning him in this uttermost distress reserved himself to the hopes of avenging that death which all his efforts could not prevent nor delay The astonishing greatness of the calamity deprived the sufferers of any relief from the view of companions in affliction With silent tears or lamentable cries they hurried on through the hostile territories and found every heart which was not steeled by native barbarity guarded by the more implacable furies of mistaken piety and religion  The saving of  Dublin  preserved in  Ireland  the remains of the  English  name The gates of that city though timorously opened received the wretched supplicants and discovered to the view a scene of human misery beyond what any eye had ever before beheld Compassion seized the amazed inhabitants aggravated with the fear of like calamities while they observed the numerous foes without and within which every where environed  them and reflected on the weak resources by which they were themselves supported The more vigorous of the unhappy fugitives to the number of three thousand were inlisted into three regiments the rest were distributed into the houses and all care was taken by diet and warmth to recruit their feeble and torpid limbs Diseases of unknown name and species derived from these multiplied distresses seized many of them and put a speedy period to their lives others having no leisure to reflect on their mighty loss of friends and fortune cursed that being which they had saved Abandoning themselves to despair refusing all succour they expired without other consolation than that of receiving among their countrymen the honours of a grave which to their slaughtered companions had been denied by the inhuman barbarians  KINGCRAFT  TO allure the nobility to court to engage them in expensive pleasures or employments which dissipate their fortune to increase their subjection to ministers by attendance to weaken their authority in the provinces by absence have been the common arts of arbitrary government  ANCIENT LITERATURE  ON the origin of letters among the  Greeks  the genius of poets and orators as might naturally be expected was distinguished by an amiable simplicity  which whatever rudeness may sometimes attend it is so fitted to express the genuine movements of nature and passion that the compositions possessed of it must for ever appear valuable to the discerning part of mankind The glaring figures of discourse the pointed antithesis the unnatural conceit the jingle of words such false ornaments were not employed by early writers not because they were rejected but because they scarce ever occurred to them An easy unforced strain of sentiment runs through their compositions though at the same time amidst the most elegant simplicity of thought and expression one is sometimes surprised to meet with a poor conceit which had presented itself unsought for and which the author had not acquired critical observation enough to condemn A bad taste seizes with avidity these frivolous beauties and even perhaps a good taste ere surfeited by them They multiply every day more and more in the fashionable compositions nature and goodsense are neglected laboured ornaments studied and admired and a total degeneracy of style and language prepares the way for barbarism and ignorance Hence the  Asiatic  manner was found to depart so much from the simple purity of  Athens  hence that tinsel eloquence which is observable in many of the  Roman  writers from which  Cicero  himself is not wholly exempted and which so much prevails in  Ovid Seneca Lucan Martial  and the  Plinys  SHAKESPEAR  IF  Shakespear  be considered as a man born in a rude age and educated in the lowest manner without any instruction either from the world or from books he may be regarded as a prodigy if represented as a poet capable of furnishing a proper entertainment to a refined or intelligent audience we must abate somewhat of this eulogy In his compositions we regret that many irregularities and even sometimes absurdities should so frequently disfigure the animated and passionate scenes intermixed with them and at the same time we perhaps admire the more those beauties on account of their being surrounded with such deformities A striking peculiarity of sentiment adapted to a singular character he frequently hits as it were by inspiration but a reasonable propriety of thought he cannot for any time uphold Nervous and picturesque expressions as well as descriptions abound in him but 'tis in vain we look either for continued purity or simplicity of diction This total ignorance of all theatrical art and conduct however material a defect yet as it affects the spectator rather than the reader we can more readily excuse than that want of taste which often prevails in his productions and which gives way only by intervals to the irradiation of genius A great and fertile genius he certainly possessed and one enriched equally with a tragic and comic vein but he ought to be cited as a proof  how dangerous it is to rely on these advantages alone for the attaining an excellence in the finer arts And there may even remain a suspicion that we overrate if possible the greatness of his genius in the same manner as bodies often appear more gigantic on account of their being disproportionate and misshapen  CARDINAL WOLSEY  HENRY  entered into all the views of  Wolsey  and finding no one so capable of executing his plan of administration as the person who proposed it he soon advanced his favourite from being the companion of his careless hours to be a member of his council and from being a member of his council to be his absolute minister By this rapid advancement and uncontrouled authority the character and genius of  Wolsey  had full opportunity to display itself Insatiable in his acquisitions but still more magnificent in his expence of extensive capacity but still more unbounded enterprise ambitious of power but still more desirous of glory insinuating engaging persuasive and by turns lofty elevated commanding haughty to his equals but affable to his dependants oppressive to the people but liberal to his friends more generous than grateful less moved by injuries than by contempt he seemed framed to take the ascendant in every intercourse with others but exerted this superiority of nature with such oftentation as exposed him to envy and made every one  willing to recall the original inferiority or rather meanness of his fortune  RICHARD I OF ENGLAND AND PHILIP OF FRANCE COMPARED  RICHARD  and  PHILIP  were by the situation and extent of their dominions rivals in power by their age and inclinations competitors for glory and these causes of emulation which had the princes been employed in the field against the common enemy might have stimulated them to martial enterprises soon excited during the present leisure and repose quarrels between monarchs of such a fiery character Equally haughty ambitious intrepid and inflexible they were irritated with the least appearance of injury and were incapable by mutual condescensions to efface those causes of complaint which unavoidably arose between them  Richard  candid sincere undesigning impolitic violent laid himself open on every occasion to the designs of his antagonist who provident interested deceitful failed not to take all advantages against him and thus both the circumstances of their dispositions in which they were similar and those in which they differed rendered it impossible for them to persevere in that harmony which was so essential to the success of their undertaking  BACON AND GALILEO  THE great glory of literature in this island during the reign of  James  I was my Lord  Bacon  Most of his performances were composed in  Latin  though he possessed neither the elegance of that nor of his native tongue If we consider the variety of talents employed by this man as a public speaker a man of business a wit a courtier a companion an author a philosopher he is justly the object of great admiration if we consider him merely as an author and philosopher the light in which we view him at present though very estimable he was yet inferior to his cotemporary  Galileo  perhaps even to  Kepler Bacon  pointed out at a distance the road to true philosophy  Galileo  both pointed it out to others and made himself considerable advances in it The  Englishman  was ignorant of geometry the  Florentine  revived that science excelled in it and was the first who applied it together with experiment to natural philosophy The former rejected with the most positive disdain the system of  Copernicus  the latter fortified it with new proofs derived both from reason and the senses  Bacon  's style is stiff and rigid his wit though often brilliant is sometimes unnatural and farfetched and he seems to be the original of those pointed similes and longspun allegories which so much distinguish the  English  authors  Galileo  is a lively and agreeable though somewhat a prolix writer but  Italy  not  united in any single government and perhaps satiated with that literary glory which it has possessed both in ancient and modern times has too much neglected the renown it has acquired by giving birth to so great a man That national spirit which prevails among the  English  and which forms their great happiness is the cause why they bestow on all their eminent writers and on  Bacon  among the rest such praises and acclamations as may often appear partial and excessive  HENRY I OF ENGLAND  THIS prince was one of the most accomplished that has filled the  English  throne and possessed all the qualities both of body and mind natural and acquired which could sit him for the high station to which he attained His person was manly his countenance engaging his eyes clear serene and penetrating The affability of his address encouraged those who might be overawed by the sense of his dignity or of his wisdom and though he often indulged his facetious humour he knew how to temper it with discretion and ever kept at a distance from all indecent familiarities with his courtiers His superior eloquence and judgment would have given him an ascendant even had he been born in a private station and his personal bravery would have procured him respect even though it had been less supported by art and policy By his great progress in literature he acquired  the name of  Beauclerc  or the Scholar but his application to these sedentary pursuits abated nothing of the activity and vigilance of his government and though the learning of that age was better fitted to corrupt than improve the understanding his natural goodsense preserved itself untainted both from the pedantry and superstition which were then so prevalent among men of letters His temper was very susceptible of the sentiments as well of friendship as of resentment and his ambition though high might be esteemed moderate and reasonable had not his conduct towards his brother and nephew shewed that he was too much disposed to sacrifice to it all the maxims of justice and equity But the total incapacity of  Robert  for government afforded his younger brother a reason or pretence for seizing the sceptre both of  Normandy  and  England  and when violence and usurpation are once begun necessity obliges a prince to continue in the same criminal course and engages him in measures which his better judgment and sounder principles would otherwise have induced him to reject with warmth and indignation  MILTON  MILTON  's poems are admirable though liable to some objections his prose writings disagreeable though not altogether defective in genius Nor are all his poems equal His  Paradise Lost  his  Comus  and a few others shine out amidst some  flat and insipid compositions Even in the  Paradise Lost  his capital performance there are very long passages amounting to near a third of the work almost wholly devoid of harmony and eloquence nay of all vigour of imagination The natural inequality in  Milton  's genius was much increased by the inequalities in his subject of which some parts are of themselves the most lofty that can enter into human conception others would have required the most laboured elegance of composition to support them It is certain that this author when in an happy mood and employed on a noble subject is the most wonderfully sublime of any poet in any language  Homer  and  Lucretius  and  Tasso  not excepted More concise than  Homer  more simple than  Tasso  more nervous than  Lucretius  had he lived in a later age and learned to polish some rudeness in his verses had he enjoyed better fortune and possessed leisure to watch the returns of genius in himself he had attained the pinnacle of human perfection and borne away the palm of epic poetry  It was during a state of poverty blindness disgrace danger and oldage that  Milton  composed his wonderful poem which not only surpassed all the performances of his cotemporaries but all the compositions which had flowed from his pen during the vigour of his age and the height of his prosperity This circumstance is not the least remarkable of all those which attend that great genius  HOBBES  NO author was more celebrated in his own age both abroad and at home than  Hobbes  in our time he is much neglectedA lively instance how precarious all reputations founded on reasoning and philosophy A pleasant comedy which paints the manners of the age and exposes a faithful picture of nature is a desirable work and is transmitted to the latest posterity but a system whether physical or metaphysical owes commonly its success to its novelty and is no sooner canvassed with impartiality than its weakness is discovered  Hobbes  's politics are fitted only to promote tyranny and his ethics to encourage licentiousness Though an enemy to religion he partakes nothing of the spirit of scepticism but is as positive and dogmatical as if human reason and his reason in particular could attain a thorough conviction on these subjects Clearness and propriety of style are the chief excellencies of  Hobbes  's writings In his own person he is represented to have been a man of virtue a character no wise surprising notwithstanding his libertine system of ethics Timidity is the principal fault with which he is reproached he lived to an extreme oldage yet could never reconcile himself to the thoughts of death The boldness of his sentiments and opinions form a remarkable contrast to this part of his character  COMMENCEMENT OF WHIG AND TORY  THE year Sixteenhundredandeighty is re+markable for being the epoch of the wellknown epithets of  Whig  and  Tory  by which and sometimes without any material difference this island has been so long divided The court party reproached their antagonists with their affinity to the fanatical conventiclers in  Scotland  who were known by the name of  Whigs  the country party found a resemblance between the courtiers and the Popish banditti in  Ireland  to whom the appellation of  Tory  was affixed And after this manner these foolish names of reproach came into public and general use and even at present seem not nearer their end than when they were first invented  HISTORY  NEW parties arose under the appellation of  Whig  and  Tory  which have continued ever since to confound and distract our government To determine the nature of those parties is perhaps one of the most difficult problems that can be met with and is a proof that history may contain questions as uncertain as any to be found in the most abstract sciences We have seen the conduct of the two parties during the course of a whole century in a vast variety of circumstances possessed of power and deprived of it during peace and war persons who profess themselves of one  side or other we meet with every hour in company in our pleasures in our serious occupations we ourselves are constrained in a manner to take party and being in a country of the highest liberty every one may openly declare all his sentiments and opinions yet are we at a loss to tell the nature pretensions and principles of the different factions  OF THE PARTIES OF GREATBRITAIN  AS no party in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annexed to its political or practical one we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation is divided has reared up a fabric of the former kind in order to protect and cover that scheme of actions which it pursues The people being commonly very rude builders especially in this speculative way and more especially still when actuated by party zeal it is natural to imagine that their workmanship must be a little unshapely and discover evident marks of that violence and hurry in which it was raised The one party by tracing up government to the Deity endeavour to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege however tyrannical it may become to touch or invade it in the smallest article The other party by founding government altogether on the consent of the people suppose that there is a kind of original  contract by which the subjects have reserved the power of resisting their sovereign whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority with which they have for certain purposes voluntarily entrusted him These are the speculative principles of the two parties and these too are the practical consequences deduced from them  THE TEMPLARS MASSACRED IN FRANCE  THE order of Knights  Templars  had risen during the first servour of the Crusades and uniting the two qualities the most popular in that age devotion and valour and exercising both in the most popular of all enterprises the defence of the Holy Land they had made rapid advances to credit and authority and had acquired from the piety of the faithful very ample possessions in every country in  Europe  especially in  France  Their great riches joined to the course of time had by degrees relaxed the severity of these virtues and the  Templars  in a great measure lost that popularity which first raised them to honour and distinction Acquainted by experience with the fatigues and dangers of those fruitless expeditions to the East they chose rather to enjoy in ease their opulent revenues in  Europe  and being all of them men of birth educated according to the custom of the age without any tincture of letters they scorned the ignoble occupations of a  monastic life and passed their time wholly in the fashionable amusements of hunting gallantry and the pleasures of the table Their rival order that of St  John of Jerusalem  whose poverty had as yet preserved them from like corruption still distinguished themselves by their enterprises against the infidels and succeeded to all the popularity which was lost by the indolence and luxury of the  Templars  But though these causes had weakened the foundation of this order once so celebrated and revered the immediate source of their destruction proceeded from the cruel and vindictive spirit of  Philip the Fair  who having entertained a private disgust against some eminent  Templars  determined to gratify at once his avidity and revenge by involving the whole order in one undistinguished ruin On no better information than that of two Knights condemned by their superiors to perpetual imprisonment for their vices and prosligacy he ordered on one day all the  Templars  of  France  to be committed to prison and imputed to them such enormous and absurd crimes as are sufficient of themselves to destroy all the credit of the accusation Besides their being universally charged with murder robbery and vices the most shocking to nature every one it was pretended whom they received into their order was obliged to renounce our Saviour to spit upon the cross and to join to this impiety the superstition of worshipping a gilded head which was secretly kept in one of their houses at  Marseilles  They also initiated  it was said every candidate by such infamous rites as could serve to no other purpose than to degrade the order in his eyes and destroy for ever the authority of all his superiors over him Above an hundred of these unhappy gentlemen were put to the torture in order to extort from them a confession of their guilt the more obstinate perished in the hands of their tormentors several to procure themselves immediate ease in the violence of their agonies acknowledged whatever was required of them forged confessions were imputed to others and  Philip  as if their guilt were now certain proceeded to a confiscation of all their treasures But no sooner had the  Templars  recovered from their tortures than preferring the most cruel execution to a life with infamy they disavowed their confessions exclaimed against the forgeries justified the innocence of their order and appealed to all the gallant actions performed by them in ancient or latter times as a full apology for their conduct The barbarous tyrant enraged at this disappointment and thinking himself now engaged in honour to proceed to extremities ordered fiftyfour of them whom he branded as relapsed heretics to perish by the punishment of fire in his capital great numbers expired after a like manner in other parts of the kingdom and when he found that the perseverance of these unhappy victims in justifying to the last their innocence had made deep impression on the spectators he endeavoured to overcome the constancy of the  Templars  by new inhumanities The Grand Master of the order  John de Molay  and another great officer brother to the sovereign of  Dauphiné  were conducted to a scaffold erected before the church of  Notre Dame  at  Paris  a full pardon was offered them on the one hand the fire destined for their execution was shewn to them on the other these gallant nobles still persisted in the protestation of their own innocence and that of their order and were instantly hurried into the flames by the executioner  In all this barbarous injustice  Clement  V who was the creature of  Philip  and then resided in  France  fully concurred and without examining a witness or making any enquiry into the truth of facts he summarily by the plenitude of his apostolic power abolished the whole order The  Templars  all over  Europe  were thrown into prison their conduct underwent a strict scrutiny the power of their enemies still pursued and oppressed them but no where except in  France  were the smallest traces of their guilt pretended to be found  England  sent back an ample testimony of their piety and morals but as the order was now annihilated the Knights were distributed into several convents and their possessions were by command of the Pope transferred to the order of St  John  COLONEL KIRK  THE following instances will give an idea of the savage nature of Colonel  Kirk  a soldier of fortune who had long served at  Tangiers  and had contracted from his habitudes with the  Moors  an inhumanity less known in  European  and free countries At his first entry into  Bridgewater  he hanged nineteen without the least enquiry into the merits of their cause As if to make sport with death he ordered a certain number to be executed while he and his company should drink to the King's health or to the Queen's or to Judge  Jefferies  Observing their feet to shake in the agonies of death he cried that he would give them music to their dancing and he immediately commanded the drums to beat and the trumpets to sound By way of experiment he ordered one man to be hung up three times questioning him at every interval whether he repented of his crime But the man obstinately asserting that notwithstanding all the past he would still willingly engage in the same cause  Kirk  ordered him to be hung in chains One story commonly told of him is memorable for the treachery as well as barbarity which attended it A young maid pleaded for the life of her brother and flung herself at  Kirk  's feet armed with all the charms which beauty and innocence bathed in tears could bestow upon her The tyrant was inflamed with desire not softened into love or clemency  He promised to grant her request provided that she in her turn would be equally compliant to him The maid yielded to the conditions but after she had passed the night with him the wanton savage next morning shewed her from the window her brother the darling object for whom she had sacrificed her virtue hanged on a gibbet which he had secretly ordered to be there erected for his execution Rage and despair and indignation took possession of her mind and deprived her for ever of her senses All the inhabitants of that country innocent as well as guilty were exposed to the ravages of this barbarian The soldiery were let loose to live on free quarter and his own regiment instructed by his example and encouraged by his exhortations distinguished themselves in a more particular manner by their outrages By way of pleasantry he used to denominate them his  lambs  an appellation which was long remembered with horror in the West of  England  JEFFERIES  LADY  Lisle  was widow of one of the regicides who had enjoyed great favour and authority under  Cromwell  and who having fled after the Restoration to  Lausanne  in  Swisserland  was there assassinated by three  Irish  ruffians who hoped to make their fortune by this infamous piece of service His widow was now prosecuted for harbouring two rebels the day after the battle of  Sedgemoor  and  Jefferies  pushed on the trial with the most unrelenting violence In vain did the aged prisoner plead that these criminals had been put into no proclamation had been convicted by no verdict nor could any man be denominated a traitor till the sentence of some legal court was passed upon him that it appeared not by any proof that she was so much as acquainted with the guilt of the persons or had heard of their joining the rebellion of  Monmouth  that though she might be obnoxious on account of her family it was well known that her heart was ever loyal and that no person in  England  had shed more tears for that fatal event in which her husband had unfortunately bore too great a share and that the same principles which she herself had ever embraced she had carefully instilled into her son and had at that very time sent him to fight against those rebels whom she was now accused of harbouring Though these arguments did not move  Jefferies  they had influence on the jury Twice they seemed inclined to bring in a favourable verdict they were as often sent back with menaces and reproaches and at last were constrained to give sentence against the prisoner Notwithstanding all application for pardon the cruel sentence was executed  AN ANECDOTE  THE most remarkable incident in the war between  Richard  I and  Philip  King of  France  was the taking prisoner in battle the Bishop of  Beauvais  a martial prelate who was of the family of  Dreux  and a near relation of the  French  king  Richard  who hated that bishop threw him into prison and loaded him with irons and when the Pope demanded his liberty and claimed him as his son the King sent his Holiness the coat of mail which the prelate had worn in battle and which was all besmeared with blood and he replied to him in the terms employed by  Jacob  's sons to that patriarch  This have we found know now whether it be thy son's coat or no  ADMIRAL BLAKE  HE was consumed with a dropsy and scurvy and hastened home that he might yield up his last breath in his native country which he so passionately loved and which he had so much adorned by his valour As he came within sight of land he expired Never man so zealous for a faction was so much respected and esteemed even by the opposite factions He was by principle an inflexible republican and the late usurpations amidst all the trust and caresses which he received from the ruling powers were thought to be very little grateful to him  It is still our duty  he said to the seamen  to fight for our country into whatever hands the government may fall  Disinterested generous liberal ambitious only of true glory dreadful only to his avowed enemies he forms one of the most perfect characters of that age and the least  stained with those errors and violences which were then so predominant The Protector ordered him a pompous funeral at the public charge but the tears of his countrymen were the most honourable panegyric on his memory  THE FATE OF MONTROSE  WHEN he was carried before the Parliament which was then sitting at  Loudon  the Chancellor in a violent declamation reproached him with the breach of the national covenant which he had subscribed his rebellion against God the King and the kingdom and the many horrible murders treasons and impieties for which he was now to be brought to condign punishment  Montrose  in his answer maintained the same superiority above his enemies to which by his fame and great actions as well as by the conscience of a good cause he was justly entitled  He is sentenced  The clergy hoping that the terrors of immediate death had now given them an advantage over their enemy flocked about him and insulted him under his fallen fortunes They pronounced his damnation and assured him that the judgment which he was so soon to suffer would prove but an easy prologue to that which he must undergo hereafter They next offered to pray with him but he was too well acquainted with those forms of imprecation  which they called prayers He told them that they were a miserable deluded and deluding people end would shortly briny their country under the most insupportable servitude to which any nation had ever been reduced "For my part" added he "I am much prouder to have my head affixed to the place where it is sentenced to stand than to have my picture hang in the King's bedchamber So far from being sorry that my legs and arms are to be sent to four cities of the kingdom I wish I had limbs enough to be dispersed into all the cities of  Christendom  there to remain as testimonies in favour of the cause for which I suffer" This sentiment that very evening while in prison he threw into verse The poem remains a signal monument of his heroic spirit and no despicable proof of his poetical genius  His Execution  Now was led forth amidst the insults of enemies and the tears of the people the man of the most illustrious birth and greatest renown of the nation to suffer for his adherence to the laws of his country and the rights of his sovereign the ignominious death destined to the meanest malefactor Every attempt which the insolence of the governing party had made to subdue his gallant spirit had hitherto proved fruitless they made yet one effort more in this last and melancholy scene when all enmity arising from motives merely  human is commonly softened and disarmed The executioner brought that book which had been published in elegant  Latin  of his truly heroic actions and tied it by a cord about his neck  Montrose  smiled at this new instance of their malice He thanked them however for their officious zeal and said that he bore this testimony of his bravery and loyalty with more pride than he had ever worn the garter Having asked whether they had any more indignities to put upon him and renewing some devout ejaculations he patiently endured the last act of the executioner  His Character  Thus perished in the thirtyeighth year of his age the gallant Marquis of  Montrose  the man whose military genius both by valour and conduct had shone forth beyond any which during these civil disorders had appeared in the three kingdoms The siner arts too in his youth he had successfully cultivated and whatever was sublime elegant or noble touched his great soul Nor was he insensible to the pleasures either of society or of love Something however of the  vast  and  unbounded  characterised all his actions and deportment and it was merely by an heroic effort of duty that he brought his mind impatient of superiority and even of equality to pay such unlimited submission to the will of his sovereign  CROMWELL  ALL composure of mind was now for ever fled from the Protector he found that the grandeur which he had attained with so much guilt and courage could not insure him that tranquillity which it belongs to virtue alone and moderation fully to ascertain Overwhelmed with the load of public affairs dreading perpetually some fatal accident in his distempered government seeing nothing around him but treacherous friends or enraged enemies possessing the confidence of no party resting his title on no principle civil or religious his power he found to depend on so delicate a poise of faction and interest as the smallest event was able without any preparation in a moment to overturn Death too which with such signal intrepidity he had braved in the field being incessantly threatened by the poniards of fanatical or interested assassins was ever present to his terrified apprehensions and haunted him in every scene of business or repose Each action of his life betrayed the terrors under which he laboured The aspect of strangers was uneasy to him With a piercing and anxious eye he surveyed every face to which he was not daily accustomed He never moved a step without strong guards attending him he wore armour under his clothes and farther secured himself by offensive weapons a sword falchion and pistols which he always carried about him He returned from no place by the direct  road or by the same way which he went Every journey he performed with hurry and precipitation Seldom he slept above three nights in the same chamber and he never let it be known beforehand what chamber he intended to choose nor entrusted himself in any which was not provided with backdoors at which centinels were carefully placed Society terrified him while he reflected on his numerous unknown implacable enemies solitude astonished him by withdrawing that protection which he found so necessary for his security  THE SACK OF ROME BY THE GERMANS  FRANCIS  was extremely desirous that the appearance of this great confederacy should engage the Emperor to relax somewhat of the extreme rigour of the treaty of  Madrid  and while he entertained these hopes he was the more remiss in his warlike preparations nor did he send in due time reinforcements to his allies in  Italy  The Duke of  Bourbon  had got possession of the whole  Milanese  of which the Emperor intended to grant him the investiture and having levied a considerable army in  Germany  he became formidable to all the  Italian  potentates and not the less so because  Charles  destitute of money had not been able to remit any pay to the forces The general was extremely beloved by his troops and in order to prevent those mutinies which were ready to break  out every moment and which their affection for him had hitherto restrained he led them to  Rome  and promised to enrich them by the plunder of that opulent city He was himself killed as he was planting a ladder to scale the walls but his soldiers rather enraged than discouraged by his death mounted to the assault by the utmost valour and entering the city sword in hand exercised all those brutalities which may be expected from ferocity excited by resistance and insolence which takes place when that resistance is no more This renowned city exposed by her renown alone to so many calamities never endured in any age even from the barbarians by whom she was often subdued such indignities as she was now constrained to suffer The unrestrained massacre and pillage which continued for several days were the least ills to which the unhappy  Romans  were exposed Whatever was respectable in modesty or sacred in religion seemed but the more to provoke the insults of the soldiery Virgins suffered violation in the arms of their parents and upon those very altars to which they had fled for protection Aged prelates after enduring every indignity and even every torture were thrown into dungeons and menaced each moment with the most cruel death in order to engage them to reveal their secret treasures or purchase liberty by exorbitant ransoms  Clement  himself who had trusted for protection to the sacredness of his character and neglected to make his escape in time  was taken captive and found that his dignity which procured him no regard from the  Spanish  soldiers did but draw on him the insolent mockery of the  German  who being generally attached to the  Lutheran  principles were pleased to gratify their animosity by the abasement of the sovereign pontiff  IMPUDENCE AND MODESTY AN ALLEGORY  JUPITER  in the beginning joined Virtue Wisdom and Confidence together and Vice Folly and Diffidence and in that society set them upon the earth But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment and said that Confidence was the natural companion of Virtue and that Vice deserved to be attended with Diffidence they had not gone far before dissension arose among them Wisdom who was the guide of the one company was always accustomed before she ventured upon any road however beaten to examine it carefully to enquire whither it led what dangers difficulties and hindrances might possibly or probably occur in it In these deliberations she usually consumed some time which delay was very displeasing to Confidence who was always inclined to hurry on without much forethought or deliberation in the first road he met Wisdom and Virtue were inseparable but Confidence one day following his impetuous  nature advanced a considerable way before his guides and companions and not feeling any want of their company he never enquired after them nor ever met with them more In like manner the other society though joined by  Jupiter  disagreed and separated As Folly saw very little way before her she had nothing to determine concerning the goodness of roads nor could give the preference to one above another and this want of resolution was increased by Diffidence who with her doubts and scruples always retarded the journey This was a great annoyance to Vice who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays and was never satisfied without his full career in whatever his inclinations led him to Folly he knew though she hearkened to Diffidence would be easily managed when alone and therefore as a vicious horse throws his rider he openly beat away this controller of all his pleasures and proceeded in his journey with Folly from whom he is inseparable Confidence and Diffidence being after this manner both thrown loose from their respective companies wandered for some time till at last chance led them at the same time to one village Confidence went directly up to the great house which belonged to Wealth the lord of the village and without staying for a porter intruded himself immediately into the innermost apartments where he found Vice and Folly well received before him He joined the train recommended himself very quickly  to his landlord and entered into such familiarity with Vice that he was enlisted in the same company along with Folly They were frequent guests of Wealth and from that moment inseparable Diffidence in the mean time not daring to approach the great house accepted of an invitation from Poverty one of the tenants and entering the cottage found Wisdom and Virtue who being repulsed by the landlord had retired thither Virtue took compassion of her and Wisdom found from her temper that she would easily improve so they admitted her into their society Accordingly by their means she altered in a little time somewhat of her manner and becoming much more amiable and engaging was now called by the name of Modesty As ill company has a greater effect than good Confidence though more refractory to counsel and example degenerated so far by the society of Vice and Folly as to pass by the name of Impudence Mankind who saw these societies as  Jupiter  first joined them and know nothing of these mutual desertions are led into strange mistakes by those means and wherever they see Impudence make account of Virtue and Wisdom and wherever they observe Modesty call her attendants Vice and Folly  OF THE STUDY OF HISTORY  THERE is nothing I would recommend more earnestly to my female readers than the Study of History as an occupation of all others the best suited both to their sex and education much more instructive than their ordinary books of amusement and more entertaining than those serious compositions which are usually to be found in their closets Among other important truths which they may learn from history they may be informed of two particulars the knowledge of which may contribute very much to their quiet and repose That our sex as well as theirs are far from being such perfect creatures as they are apt to imagine and That Love is not the only passion that governs the male world but is often overcome by avarice ambition vanity and a thousand other passions Whether they be the false representations of mankind in those two particulars that endear romances and novels so much so the fair sex I know not but must confess I am sorry to see them have such an aversion to matter of fact and such an appetite for falsehood I remember I was once desired by a young beauty for whom I had some passion to send her some novels and romances for her amusement in the country but was not so ungenerous as to take the advantage which such a course of reading might have given me being resolved not to make  use of poisoned arms against her I therefore sent her  Plutarch  's Lives assuring her at the same time that there was not a word of truth in them from beginning to end She perused them very attentively till she came to the Lives of  Alexander  and  Caesar  whose names she had heard of by accident and then returned me the book with many reproaches for deceiving her  I may indeed be told that the fair sex have no such aversion to history as I have represented provided it be  secret  history and contain some memorable transaction proper to excite their curiosity But as I do not find that truth which is the basis of history is at all regarded in those anecdotes I cannot admit of this as a proof of their passion for that study However this may be I see not why the same curiosity might not receive a more proper direction and lead them to desire accounts of those who lived in past ages as well as of their contemporaries What is it to  Cleora  whether  Fulvia  entertains a secret commerce of love with  Philander  or not Has she not equal reason to be pleased when she is informed what is whispered about among historians that  Cato  's sister had an intrigue with  Caesar  and palmed her son  Marcus Brutus  upon her husband for his own though in reality he was her gallant's And are not the loves of  Messalina  or  Julia  as proper subjects of discourse as any intrigue that this city has produced of late years  But I know not whence it comes that I have been thus seduced into a kind of raillery against the ladies unless perhaps it proceed from the same cause that makes the person who is the favourite of the company be often the object of their goodnatured jests and pleasantries We are pleased to address ourselves after any manner to a person that is agreeable to us and at the same time presume that nothing will be taken amiss by one who is secure of the good opinion and affections of every one present I shall now proceed to handle my subject more seriously and shall point out the many advantages that flow from the Study of History and show how well suited it is to every one but particularly to those who are debarred the severer studies by the tenderness of their complexion and the weakness of their education The advantages found in history seem to be of three kinds as it amuses the fancy as it improves the understanding and as it strengthens virtue  In reality what more agreeable entertainment to the mind than to be transported into the remotest ages of the world and to observe human society in its infancy making the first faint essays towards the arts and sciences To see the policy of government and the civility of conversation ref  ning by degrees and every thing that is ornamental to human life advancing towards its perfection To mark the rise progress declension and final extinction of the most flourishing empires the virtues  which contributed to their greatness and the vices which drew on their ruin In short to see all human race from the beginning of time pass as it were in review before us appearing in their true colours without any of those disguises which during their lifetime so much perplexed the judgments of the beholders What spectacle can be imagined so magnificent so various so interesting What amusement either of the senses or imagination can be compared with it Shall those trifling pastimes which engross so much of our time be preferred as more satisfactory and more sit to engage our attention How perverse must that taste be which is capable of so wrong a choice of pleasures  But history is a most improving part of knowledge as well as an agreeable amusement and indeed a great part of what we commonly call  erudition  and value so highly is nothing but an acquaintance with historical facts An extensive knowledge of this kind belongs to Men of Letters but I must think it an unpardonable ignorance in persons of whatever sex or condition not to be acquainted with the history of their own country along with the histories of ancient  Greece  and  Rome  A woman may behave herself with goodmanners and have even some vivacity in her turn of wit but where her mind is so unfurnished 'tis impossible her conversation can afford any entertainment to men of sense and reflection  I must add that history is not only a valuable part of knowledge but opens the door to many other parts of knowledge and affords materials to  of the sciences And indeed if we consider the shortness of human life and our limited knowledge even of what passes in our own time we must be sensible that we should be for ever children in understanding were it not for this invention which extends our experience to all past ages and to the most distant nations making them contribute as much to our improvement in wisdom as if they had actually lain under our observation A man acquainted with history may in some respect be said to have lived from the beginning of the world and to have been making continual additions to his stock of knowledge in every century  There is also an advantage in that knowledge which is acquired by history above what is learned by the practice of the world that it brings us acquainted with human affairs without diminishing in the least from the most delicate sentiments of virtue And to tell the truth I know not any study or occupation so unexceptionable as history in this particular Poets can paint virtue in the most charming colours but as they address themselves entirely to the passions they often become advocates for vice Even philosophers are apt to bewilder themselves in the subtilty of their speculations and we have seen some go so far as  to deny the reality of all moral distinctions But I think it a remark worthy the attention of the speculative reader that the historians have been almost without exception the true friends of virtue and have always represented it in its proper colours however they may have erred in their judgments of particular persons  Machiavel  himself discovers a true sentiment of virtue in his History of  Florence  When he talks as a politician in his general reasonings he considers poisoning assassination and perjury as lawful arts of power but when he speaks as an historian in his particular narrations he shows so keen an indignation against vice and so warm an approbation of virtue in many passages that I could not forbear applying to him that remark of  Horace  That if you chase away nature though with never so great indignity she will always return upon you Nor is this combination of historians in favour of virtue at all difficult to be accounted for When a man of business enters into life and action he is more apt to consider the characters of men as they have relation to his interest than as they stand in themselves and has his judgment warped on every occasion by the violence of his passion When a philosopher contemplates characters and manners in his closet the general abstract view of the objects leaves the mind so cold und unmoved that the sentiments of nature have no room to play and he scarce feels the difference betwixt vice and virtue History keeps in a just medium betwixt these extremes  and places the objects in their true point of view The writers of history as well as the readers are sufficiently interested in the characters and events to have a lively sentiment of blame or praise and at the same time have no particular interest or concern to pervert their judgment  Verae voces tum demum pectore ab imo  Eliciuntur  AVARICE  A MISER being dead and fairly interred came to the banks of the  Styx  desiring to be ferry'd over along with the other ghosts  Charon  demands his fare and is surprised to see the Miser rather than pay it throw himself into the river and swim over to the other side notwithstanding all the clamour and opposition that could be made to him All hell was in an uproar and each of the judges was meditating some punishment suitable to a crime of such dangerous consequence to the infernal revenues Shall he be chained to the rock along with  Prometheus  or tremble below the precipice in company with the  Danaides  or assist  Sisyphus  in rolling his stone No says  Minos  none of these We must invent some severer punishment Let him be sent back to the earth to see the use his heirs are making of his riches  ON THE SAME  OUR old mother Earth once laid an indictment against Avarice before the courts of heaven for her wicked and malicious counsel and advice in tempting inducing persuading and traiterously seducing the children of the plaintiff to commit the detestable crime of parricide upon her and mangling her body ransack her very bowels for hidden treasure The indictment was very long and verbose but we must omit a great part of the repetitions and synonymous terms not to tire our reader too much with our tale Avarice being called before  Jupiter  to answer to this charge had not much to say in her own defence The injury was clearly proved upon her The fact indeed was notorious and the injury had been frequently repeated When therefore the plaintiff demanded justice  Jupiter  very readily gave sentence in her favour and his decree was to this purpose That since Dame Avarice the defendant had thus grievously injured Dame Earth the plaintiff she was hereby ordered to take that treasure of which she had feloniously robbed the said plaintiff by ransacking her bosom and in the same manner as before opening her bosom restore it back to her without diminution or retention From this sentence it shall follow says  Jupiter  to the bystanders that in all future ages the retainers of Avarice shall bury and conceal their riches and thereby restore to the Earth what they took from her  LOVE AND MARRIAGE AN ALLEGORY  MANKIND were not as at present originally divided into male and female but each individual was a compound of both sexes and was in himself both Husband and Wife melted down into one living creature This union was doubtless very entire and the parts well adjusted together since there subsisted the most perfect harmony between male and female though obliged to continue inseparable companions But so great was the happiness flowing from this union that the  menwomen  became insolent on their prosperity and rebelled against the gods To punish them for this temerity  Jupiter  could contrive no better expedient than to divorce the male part from the female and make two imperfect beings of the compound which was before so perfect Hence the origin of men and women as distinct creatures But notwithstanding our division so lively is our remembrance of the happiness enjoyed in our primaeval state that we are never at rest in the present Each of these halves is continually searching through the whole species to find the other half which was broken from it and when they meet they join again with the greatest fondness and sympathy But it often happens that they are mistaken in this particular that they take for their half what no way corresponds to them and that the parts do not meet nor join in with each other as is usual  with fractures In this case the union is soon dissolved and each part is set loose again to hunt for its lost half joining itself to every one it meets by way of trial and enjoying no rest till its perfect sympathy with its partner shews that it has at last been successful in its endeavours  When  Jupiter  had separated the male from the female and had quelled their pride and ambition by so severe an operation he could not but repent him of the cruelty of his vengeance and take compassion on poor mortals who were now become incapable of any repose or tranquillity Such cravings such anxieties such necessities arose as made them curse their creation and think existence itself a punishment In vain had they recourse to every other occupation and amusement In vain did they seek after every pleasure of sense and every refinement of reason Nothing could fill that void which they felt in their hearts or supply the loss of their partner who was so fatally separated from them To remedy this disorder and to bestow some comfort at least on human race in their forlorn situation  Jupiter  sent down  Love  and  Hymen  to collect the broken halves of human kind and piece them together in the best manner possible These two deities found such a prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in their primitive state that they proceeded on their work with wonderful success for some time till at last from many unlucky accidents dissension arose  betwixt them The chief counsellor and favourite of  Hymen  was  Care  who was continually filling his patron's head with prospects of futurity a settlement family children servants so that little else was regarded in all the matches  they  made On the other hand  Love  had chosen  Pleasure  for his favourite who was as pernicious a counsellor as the other and would never allow  Love  to look beyond the present momentary gratification or the satisfying of the prevailing inclination These two favourites became in a little time irreconcileable enemies and made it their chief business to undermine each other in all their undertakings No sooner had  Love  fixed upon two halves which he was cementing together and forming to a close union but  Care  insinuates himself and bringing  Hymen  along with him dissolves the union produced by  Love  and joins each half to some other half which he had provided for it To be revenged of this  Pleasure  creeps in upon a pair already joined by  Hymen  and calling  Love  to his assistance they underhand contrive to join each half by secret links to halves which  Hymen  was wholly unacquainted with It was not long before this quarrel was felt in its pernicious consequences arid such complaints arose before the throne of  Jupiter  that he was obliged to summon the offending parties to appear before him in order to give an account of their proceedings After hearing the pleadings on both sides he ordered an immediate reconcilement betwixt  Love  and  Hymen  as the  only expedient for giving happiness to mankind and that he might be sure this reconcilement should be durable he laid his strict injunctions on them never to join any halves without consulting their favourites  Care  and  Pleasure  and obtaining the consent of both to the conjunction Where this order is strictly observed the  Androgyne  ManWoman  is perfectly restored and human race enjoy the same happiness as in their primaeval state The seam is scarce perceived that joins the two beings together but both of them combine to form one perfect and happy creature  A CURIOUS LETTER  Paris  Aug  SIR  I KNOW you are more curious of accounts of men than of buildings and are more desirous of being informed of private history than of public transactions for which reason I thought the following story which is the common topic of conversation in this city would be no unacceptable entertainment to you  A young lady of birth and fortune being left entirely at her own disposal persisted long in a resolution of leading a single life notwithstanding several advantageous offers that had been made to her She had been determined to embrace this resolution by observing the many unhappy marriages  among her acquaintance and by hearing the complaints which her female friends made of the tyranny inconstancy jealousy or indifference of their husbands Being a woman of strong spirit and an uncommon way of thinking she found no difficulty either in forming or maintaining this resolution and could not suspect herself of such weakness as ever to be induced by any temptation to depart from it She had however entertained a strong desire of having a son whose education she was resolved to make the principal concern of her life and by that means supply the place of those other passions which she was resolved for ever to renounce She pushed her philosophy to such an uncommon length as to find no contradiction betwixt such a desire and her former resolution and accordingly looked about with great deliberation to find among all her male acquaintance one whose character and person were agreeable to her without being able to satisfy herself on that head At length being in the playhouse one evening she sees in the  parterre  a young man of a most engaging countenance and modest deportment and feels such a prepossession in his favour that she had hopes this must be the person she had long sought for in vain She immediately dispatches a servant to him desiring his company at her lodgings next morning The young man was overjoyed at the message and could not command his satisfaction upon receiving such an advance from a lady of so great beauty  reputation and quality He was therefore much disappointed when he found a woman who would allow him no freedoms and amidst all her obliging behaviour confined and overawed him to the bounds of rational discourse and conversation She seemed however willing to commence a friendship with him and told him that his company would always be acceptable to her whenever he had a leisure hour to bestow He needed not much intreaty to renew his visits being so struck with her wit and beauty that he must have been unhappy had he been debarred her company Every conversation served only the more to inflame his passion and gave him more occasion to admire her person and understanding as well as to rejoice in his own good fortune He was not however without anxiety when he considered the disproportion of their birth and fortune nor was his uneasiness allayed even when he reflected on the extraordinary manner in which their acquaintance had commenced Our philosophical heroine in the mean time discovered that her lover's personal qualities did not belie his physiognomy so that judging there was no occasion for any farther trial she takes a proper opportunity of communicating to him her whole intention Their intercourse continued for some time till at last her wishes were crowned and she was now mother of a boy who was to be the object of her future care and concern Gladly would she have continued her friendship with the father but finding him  too passionate a lover to remain within the bounds of friendship she was obliged to put a violence upon herself She sends him a letter in which she had inclosed a bond of annuity for a thousand crowns desiring him at the same time never to see her more and to forget if possible all past favours and familiarities He was thunderstruck at receiving this message and having tried in vain all the arts that might win upon the resolution of a woman resolved at last to attack her by her  foible  He commences a lawsuit against her before the parliament of  Paris  and claims his son whom he pretends a right to educate as he pleased according to the usual maxims of the law in such cases She pleads on the other hand their express agreement before their commerce and pretends that he had renounced all claim to any offspring that might arise from their embraces It is not yet known how the parliament will determine in this extraordinary case which puzzles all the lawyers as much as it does the philosophers As soon as they come to any issue I shall inform you of it and shall embrace any opportunity of subscribing myself as I do at present  Your most humble servant  c  A FABLE  ONE rivulet meeting another with whom he had been long united in strictest amity with noisy haughtiness and disdain thus bespoke him "What brother still in the same state still  low and creeping Are you not ashamed when you behold me who though lately in a like condition with you am now become a great river and shall shortly be able to rival the  Danube  or the  Rhine  provided those friendly rains continue which have favoured my banks but neglected yours" "Very true" replies the humble rivulet "you are now indeed swoln to great size but methinks you are become withal somewhat turbulent and muddy I am contented with my low condition and my purity"  CHARACTER OF A GREAT MINISTER  THERE never was a man whose actions and character have been more earnestly and openly canvassed than those of the present Minister who having governed a learned and free nation for so long a time amidst such mighty opposition may make a large library of what has been wrote for and against him and is the subject of above half the paper that has been blotted in this nation within these twenty years I wish for the honour of our country that any one character of him had been drawn with such  judgment  and  impartiality  as to have some credit with posterity and to shew that our liberty has once at least been employed to good purpose I am only afraid of failing in the former quality of judgment but if it should be so 'tis but one page more thrown away after an hundred thousand upon the same subject that have perished and become useless  In the mean time I shall flatter myself with the pleasing imagination that the following character will be adopted by future historians  Sir  Robert Walpole  Prime Minister of  GreatBritain  is a man of ability not a genius goodnatured not virtuous constant not magnanimous moderate not equitable  Moderate in the exercise of power not equitable in engrossing it  His virtues in some instances are free from the allay of those vices which usually accompany such virtues he is a generous friend without being a bitter enemy His vices in other instances are not compensated by those virtues which are nearly allied to them his want of enterprise is not attended with frugality The private character of the man is better than the public his virtues more than his vices his fortune greater than his fame With many good qualities he has incurred the public hatred with good capacity he has not escaped ridicule He would have been esteemed more worthy of his high station had he never possessed it and is better qualified for the second than for the first place in any government His ministry has been more advantageous to his family than to the public better for this age than for posterity and more pernicious by bad precedents than by real grievances During his time trade has flourished liberty declined and learning gone to ruin As I  am a man I love him as I am a scholar I hate him as I am a  Briton  I calmly wish his fall And were I a Member of either House I would give my vote for removing him from St  James  's but should be glad to see him retire to  HoughtonHall  to pass the remainder of his days in ease and pleasure  END OF THE BEAUTIES OF HUME  THE BEAUTIES OF BOLINGBROKE  MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY  THOUGH our Kings can do no wrong and though they cannot be called to account by any form our constitution prescribes their Ministers may They are answerable for the administration of the government each for his particular part and the prime or sole Minister when there happens to be one for the whole He is so the more and the more justly if he hath affected to render himself so by usurping on his fellows by wriggling intriguing whispering and bargaining himself into this dangerous post to which he was not called by the general suffrage nor perhaps by the deliberate choice of his master himself  DISSERT ON PARTIES  A KING  HE is really nothing more than a supreme Magistrate instituted for the service of the community  which requires that the executive power should be vested in a single person He hath indeed a crown on his head a sceptre in his hand and velvet robes on his back and he sits elevated on a throne whilst others stand on the ground about him and all this to denote that he is a King and to draw the attention and reverence of the vulgar Just so another man wears a mitre on his head a crosier in his hand and lawn sleeves and sits in a purple elbowchair to denote that he is a Bishop and to excite the devotion of the multitude who receive his benediction very thankfully on their knees But still the King as well as the Bishop holds an office and owes a service The King when he commands discharges a trust and performs a duty as well as the subject when he obeys  IBID  SAXON KINGS  THE manner in which the  Saxons  established themselves and the long wars they waged for and against the  Britons  led to and maintained monarchical rule amongst them But these Kings were in their first institution no doubt such as  Tacitus  describes the  German  Kings and Princes to have been Chiefs who persuaded rather than commanded and who were heard in the public assemblies of the nation according as their age their nobility their military fame or their eloquence gave them authority How many doughty Monarchs  in later and more polite ages would have slept in cottages and have worked in stalls instead of inhabiting palaces and being cushioned up in thrones if this rule of government had continued in force  IBID  THE BRITISH KING  A KING of  Britain  is now strictly and properly what Kings should always be a member but the supreme member or the head of a political body Part of one individual specific whole in every respect distinct from it or independent of it in none he can move no longer in another orbit from his people and like some superior planet attract repel influence and direct their motions by his own He and they are parts of the same system intimately joined and cooperating together acted and acting upon limiting and limited controuling and controuled by one another and when he ceases to stand in this relation to them he ceases to stand in any The settlements by virtue of which he governs are plainly original contracts his institution is plainly conditional and he may forseit his right to allegiance as undeniably and effectually as the subject may forseit his right to protection There are no longer any hidden reserves of authority to be let out on occasion and to overflow the rights and privileges of the people The laws of the land are known  and they are the sole springs from whence the Prince can derive his pretensions and the people theirs  IBID  A BAD MINISTER  A MINISTER who made his administration hateful in some respects and despicable in others who sought that security by ruining the constitution which he had forfeited by dishonouring the government who encouraged the profligate and seduced the unwary to concur with him in this design by affecting to explode all public spirit and to ridicule every form of our constitution such a Minister would be looked upon most justly as the shame and scourge of his country sooner or later he would fall without pity and it is hard to say what punishment would be proportionable to his crimes  IBID  NATIONAL UNANIMITY  TO divide can never be an expedient for good purposes any more than to corrupt since the peace and prosperity of a nation will always depend on uniting as far as possible the heads hearts and hands of the whole people and on improving not debauching their morals  Divide et impera  is a maxim often quoted How are we to apply it There is no place for it in arbitrary  governments for in them the interest of the governors requires that a servile union if it may be called an union should be maintained by the weight of power like that of slaves in a galley who are united by their chains and who tug the oar together at the sound of a whistle  IBID  PROSCRIPTIONS  PROSCRIPTIONS are abominable and inhuman when they are backed by a fullness of arbitrary power But to hang up the tables of proscription without the power of sending centurions to cut off everyhead that wears a face disliked at court would be madness in a Prince Such a conduct cannot suit his interest however it may his passions in any circumstance whatever  IBID  THE DEPENDENCE OF PARLIAMENT  WHO could have expected to hear a dependency a corrupt dependency of the Parliament on the Crown contended for and asserted to be a necessary expedient to supply a want of power which is falsely supposed in the Crown as if our fathers had opposed and at length destroyed that chimera called Prerogative formerly so dangerous to our liberties for no other reason but to furnish arguments for letting loose upon us another monster more dangerous to our liberties  IBID  PUBLIC RUIN  IT will always be trifling and foolish to ask what laws have been broken what invasions on the constitution have been made because as nothing of this sort will be done when there are no designs dangerous to the constitution carried on so when there are such designs whatever is done of this sort will be private indirect and so covered that the greatest moral certainty may be destitute of proof Whenever any of these things are done publicly directly and in a manner to be easily proved the danger will be over the constitution will be destroyed and all fear for it and concern about it will be impertinent because they will come too late  IBID  ERROR  NOTHING can give stability and durable uniformity to error Indolence or ignorance may keep it floating as it were on the surface of the mind and sometimes hinder truth from penetrating or force may maintain it in possession when the mind assents to it no longer But such opinions like human bodies tend to their dissolution from their birth They will be soon rejected in theory where men can think and in practice where men can act with freedom They maintain themselves no longer than the same means of seduction which first introduced them or the same  circumstances which first imposed them attend and continue to support them Men are dragged into them and held down in them by chains of circumstances Break but these chains and the mind returns with a kind of intellectual elasticity to its proper object truth  IBID  KNOWLEDGE OF CHARACTER  NOTHING is more useful nothing more necessary in the conduct of public affairs than a just discernment of spirits I mean here not only that natural private sagacity which is conversant about individuals and enables some men to pry as it were into the heads and hearts of others and to discover within them those latent principles which constitute their true characters and are often disguised in outward action but I mean principally that acquired public political sagacity which is of the same kind though I think not altogether the same thing as the former which flows from nature too but requires more to be assisted by experience and formed by art This is that superior talent of Ministers of State which is so rarely found in those of other countries and which abounds so happily at present in those of  GreatBritain  It is by this that they discover the most secret dispositions of other courts and discovering those dispositions prevent their designs or never suffer themselves to be surprised by  them It is by this that they watch over the public tranquillity at home foresee what effects every event that happens and much more every step they make themselves will have on the sentiments and passions of mankind This part of human wisdom is therefore every where of use but is of indispensible necessity in free countries where a greater regard is to be constantly had to the various fluctuations of parties to the temper humour opinion and prejudices of the people Without such a regard as this those combinations of peculiar circumstances which we commonly call conjunctures can never be improved to the best advantage by acting in conformity and in proportion to them and without improving such conjunctures to the best advantage it is impossible to atchieve any great undertaking or even to conduct affairs successfully in their ordinary course  IBID  MINISTERIAL PREROGATIVE  IT is certainly an easier talk and there is somewhat less provoking as well as less dangerous in it to struggle even with a great Prince who stands on prerogative than with a weak but profligate Minister if he hath the means of corruption in his power and if the luxury and prostitution of the age have enabled him to bring it into fashion Nothing surely could provoke men who had the spirit of liberty in their souls more than to figure  to themselves one of these saucy creatures of Fortune whom she raises in the extravagance of her caprice dispatching his emissaries ecclesiastical and secular like so many evil daemons to the North and to the South to buy the votes of the people with the money of the people and to chuse a representative body not of the people but of the enemy of the people of himself  IBID  THE ETIQUETTE OF GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION  THIS was not the case in the reign of  James  the Second It was prerogative not money which had like to have destroyed our liberties then Government was not then carried on by undertakers to whom so much power was farmed out for returns of so much money and so much money intrusted for returns of so much power But though the case was not so desperate yet was it bad enough in all conscience and among all the excesses into which the Tories ran in favour of the Crown and in hopes of fixing dominion in their own party their zeal to support the methods of garbling corporations was in my opinion that which threatened public liberty the most It hath been reproached to them by many but if among those who reproached them there should be some who have shared since that time in the more dangerous practice of corrupting corporations such men must  have fronts of brass and deserve all the indignation which is due to iniquity aggravated by impudence  IBID  A COALITION OF PARTIES AT THE REVOLUTION  MANY of the most distinguished Tories some of those who carried highest the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance were engaged in and the whole nation was ripe for the Revolution The Whigs were zealous in the same cause but their zeal was not such as I think it had been some years before a zeal without knowledge I mean that it was better tempered and more prudently conducted Though the King was not the better for his experience parties were Both saw their errors The Tories stopped short in the pursuit of a bad principle The Whigs reformed the abuse of a good one Both had sacrificed their country to their party Both sacrificed on this occasion their party to their country When the Tories and the Whigs were thus coalited the latter stood no longer in need of any adventitious help If they did not refuse the assistance of those who had weakened their cause more by the jealousies and fears to which they gave both occasion and pretence than they had strengthened it by their numbers yet they suffered them to have no influence in their counsels no direction of their conduct The cause of liberty was no longer made  the  of a party by being set on such a bottom and pushed in such a manner as one party alone approved The Revolution was plainly designed to restore and secure our government ecclesiastical and civil on true foundations and whatever may happen to the King there was no room to expect any change of the constitution There were some indeed concerned in this great and glorious undertaking who had obstinately preserved or lightly taken up the republican and other whimsies that reigned in the days of usurpation and confusion If they could have prevailed and it was no fault of theirs they did not the coalition of parties had been broken and instead of a revolution we might have had a civil war perhaps not even that sad chance for our religion and liberty But this leaven was so near worn out that it could neither corrupt nor seem any longer to corrupt the mass of the Whig party The party never had been Presbyterians nor Republicans any more than they had been Quakers any more than the Tory party had been Papists when notwithstanding their aversion to Popery they were undeniably under the accidental influence of Popish councils But even the appearances were now rectified The Revolution was a fire which purged off the dross of both parties and the dross being purged off they appeared to be the same metal and answered the same standard  IBID  THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT ON THE SPIRIT OF NATIONS  AS the natural dispositions of men are altered and formed into different moral characters by education so the spirit of a constitution of government which is confirmed improved and strengthened by the course of events and especially by those of fruitless opposition in a long tract of time will have a proportionable influence on the reasoning the sentiments and the conduct of those who are subject to it A different spirit and contrary prejudices may prevail for a time but the spirit and principles of the constitution will prevail at last If one be unnatural and the other absurd and that is the case of many governments a vigorous exercise of power signal rewards signal punishments and variety of other secondary means which in such constitutions are never wanting will however maintain as long as they are employed both the spirit and the principles But if the spirit and principles of a constition be agreeable to nature and the true ends of government which is the case of the present constitution of the  British  government they want no such means to make them prevail They not only flourish without them but they would fade and die away with them As liberty is nourished and supported by such a spirit and such principles so they are propagated by liberty Truth and reason  are often able to get the better of authority in particular minds but truth and reason with authority on their side will carry numbers bear down prejudices and become the very genius of a people The progress they make is always sure but sometimes not observable by every eye Contrary prejudices may seem to maintain themselves in vigour and these prejudices may be kept up long by passion and by artifice but when truth and reason continue to act without restraint a little sooner or a little later and often when this turn is least expected the prejudices vanish at once and truth and reason triumph without any rival  IBID  THE LINEAL DESCENT OF LIBERTY  A SPIRIT of liberty transmitted down from our  Saxon  ancestors and the unknown ages of our government preserved itself through an almost continual struggle against the usurpations of our princes and the vices of our people and they whom neither the  Plantagenets  nor the  Tudors  could enslave were incapable of suffering their rights and privileges to be ravished from them by the  Stuarts  They bore with the last King of this unhappy race till it was shameful as it must have been fatal to bear any longer and while they asserted their liberties they refuted and anticipated by their temper and their patience all the objections which foreign and domestic abettors of  tyranny are apt to make against the conduct of our nation towards our Kings Let us justify thi  conduct by persisting in it and continue to ourselves the peculiar honour of maintaining the freedom of our Gothic institution of government when so many other nations who enjoyed the same have lost theirs  IBID  THE CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT DISTINGUISHED  IT may be asked perhaps how men who are friends to a government can be enemies at the same time to the constitution on which that government is founded But the answer will be easy if we consider these two things first the true distinction so often confounded in writing and almost always in conversation between Constitution and Government By Constitution we mean whenever we speak with propriety and exactness the assemblage of laws institutions and customs derived from certain fixed principles of reason directed to certain fixed objects of public good that compose the general system according to which the community hath agreed to be governed By Government we mean whenever we speak in the same manner that particular tenor of conduct which a chief magistrate and inferior magistrates under his direction and influence hold in the administration of public affairs We call this a Good Government when the execution of the laws the  observation of the institutions and customs in short the whole administration of public affairs is wisely pursued and with a strict conformity to the principles and objects of the constitution We call it a Bad Government when it is administered on other principles and directed to other objects either wickedly or weakly either by obtaining new laws which want this conformity or by perverting old ones which had it and when this is done without law or in open violation of the laws we term it a Tyrannical Government In a word and to bring this home to our own case Constitution is the rule by which our Princes ought to govern at all times Government is that by which they actually do govern at any particular time One may remain immutable the other may and as human nature is constituted must vary One is the criterion by which we are to try the other for surely we have a right to do so since if we are to live in subjection to the government of our Kings our Kings are to govern in subjection to the constitution and the conformity or nonconformity of their government to it prescribes the measure of our submission to them according to the principles of the Revolution and of our present settlement in both of which though some remote regard war had to blood yet the preservation of the constitution manifestly determined the community to the choice then made of the persons who should govern  IBID  ROYAL POPULARITY  A PRINCE tolerably honest or tolerably wise will know that to unite himself to bad men is to disunite himself from his people and that he makes a stupid bargain if he prefers trick to policy expedient to system and a cabal to the nation Reason and experience will teach him that a Prince who does so must govern weakly ignominiously and precariously whilst he who engages and employs all the heads and hands of his people governs with strength with splendor and with safety and is sure of rising to a degree of absolute power by maintaining liberty which the most successful tyrant could never reach by imposing slavery  IBID  A DESPOT  TO govern a society of freemen by a constitution founded on the eternal rules of right reason and directed to promote the happiness of the whole and of every individual is the noblest prerogative which can belong to humanity and if any man may be said without profaneness to imitate God in any case this is the case But sure I am he imitates the Devil who is so far from promoting the happiness of others that he makes his own happiness to consist in the misery of others who governs by no rule but that of his passions whatever appearances he is forced sometimes to put on who endeavours to corrupt the innocent and to  enslave the free whose business is to seduce and betray whose pleasure is to damn and whose triumph is to torment Odious and execrable as this character is it is the character of every prince or minister who makes use of his power to subvert or even to weaken that constitution which ought to be the rule of his government  IBID  PARLIAMENTARY DESPOTISM  TO destroy  British  liberty with an army of  Britons  is not a measure so sure of success as some people may believe To corrupt the parliament is a flower but might prove a more effectual method and two or three hundred mercenaries in the two houses if they could be lifted there would be more fatal to the constitution than ten times as many thousands in red and in blue out of them Parliaments are the true guardians of liberty for this principally they were instituted and this is the principal article of that great and noble trust which the collective body of the people of  Britain  reposes in the representative But then no slavery can be so effectually brought and fixed upon us as parliamentary slavery By the corruption of parliament and the absolute influence of a King or his minister on the two houses we return into that state to deliver us or secure us from which parliaments were instituted and are really governed by the arbitrary will of one man Our whole constitution is at once dissolved Many securities to liberty are  provided but the integrity which depends on the freedom and the independency of parliament is the keystone which keeps the whole together If this be shaken our constitution totters if it be quite removed our constitution falls into ruin that noble fabric the pride of  Britain  the envy of her neighbours raised by the labour of so many centuries repaired at the expence of so many millions and cemented by such a profusion of blood that noble fabric I say which was able to resist the united efforts of so many races of  giants  may be demolished by a race of  pigmies  The integrity of parliament is a kind of palladium a tutelary goddess who protects our state When she is once removed we may become the prey of any enemies No  Agamemnon  no  Achilles  will be wanted to take our city  Thersites  himself will be sufficient for such a conquest  IBID  HOW LIBERTY MAY BE LOST  WE do not read I think of more than one  The Cappadocians Vide Strabo lib xii  nation who refused liberty when it was offered to them but we read of many and have almost seen some who lost it through their own fault by the plain and necessary consequences of their own conduct when they were in full possession of it and had the means of securing it effectually in their own power A wise and brave people will neither  be cozened nor bullied out of their liberty but a wise and brave people may cease to be such they may degenerate they may sink into sloth and luxury they may resign themselves to a treacherous conduct or abet the enemies of the constitution under a notion of supporting the friends of the government they may want the sense to discern their danger in time or the courage to resist when it stares them in the face  As all government began so all government must end with the people tyrannical governments by their virtue and courage and even free governments by their vice and baseness Our constitution indeed makes it impossible to destroy liberty by any sudden blast of popular fury or by the treachery of a few for though the many cannot hurt they may easily save themselves but if the many will concur with the few if they will advisedly and deliberately suffer their liberty to be taken away by those to whom they delegate power to preserve it this no constitution can prevent God could not even support his own theocracy against the concurrent desire of the children of  Israel  but gave them a King in his anger how then could our human constitution support itself against this universal change in the temper and character of our people It cannot be We may give ourselves a tyrant in our folly if we please but this can never happen till the whole nation falls into a state of political reprobation Then and not till then political damnation will be our lot  If the people of this island should suffer their liberties to be at any time ravished or stolen from them they would incur greater blame and deserve by consequence less pity than any enslaved and oppressed people ever did By how much true liberty had been more boldly asserted more wisely or more successfully improved and more firmly established in this than in other countries by so much the more heavy would our just condemnation prove in the case that is here supposed The virtue of our ancestors to whom all these advantages are owing would aggravate the guilt and the infamy of their degenerate posterity There have been ages of gold and of silver of brass and of iron in our little world as in the great world though not in the same order In which of these ages we are at present let others determine This at least is certain that in all these ages  Britain  hath been the temple as it were of Liberty Whilst her sacred fires have been extinguished in so many countries here they have been religiously kept alive Here she hath her saints her confessors and a whole army of martyrs and the gates of hell have not hitherto prevailed against her so that if a fatal reverse is to happen if servility and servitude are to overrun the whole world like injustice and liberty is to retire from it like  Astraea  our portion of the abandoned globe will have at least the mournful honour whenever it happens of shewing her last her parting steps  Some nations have received the yoke of servitude with little or no struggle but if ever it is imposed upon us we must not only hold out our necks to receive it we must help to put it on Now to be passive in such a case is shameful but to be active is supreme and unexampled infamy In order to become slaves we of this nation must be beforehand what other people have been rendered by a long course of servitude we must become the most corrupt most profligate the most senseless the most servile nation of wretches that ever disgraced humanity for a force sufficient to ravish liberty from us such as a great standing army is in time of peace cannot be continued unless we continue it nor can the means necessary to steal liberty from us be long enough employed with effect unless we give a sanction to their iniquity who call good evil and evil good  IBID  THE FALL OF ROME  THE grandeur of  Rome  was the work of many centuries the effect of much wisdom and the price of much blood She maintained her grandeur whilst she preserved her virtue but when luxury grew up to favour corruption and corruption to nourish luxury then  Rome  grew venal the election of her magistrates the sentences of her judges the decrees of her senate all was sold for her liberty was sold when these were sold  and her riches her power her glory could not long survive her liberty She who had been the envy as well as the mistress of nations fell to be an object of their scorn or their pity They had seen and felt that she governed other people by will and her own by law They beheld her govern herself by will by the arbitrary will of the worst of her own citizens of the worst of both sexes of the worst of human kind by  Caligula  by  Claudius  by  Nero  by  Messalina  by  Agrippina  by  Poppaea  by  Narcissus  by  Calistus  by  Pallas  by Princes that were stupid or mad by women that were abandoned to ambition and to lust by ministers that were emancipated slaves parasites and panders insolent and rapacious In this miserable state the few that retained some sparks of the old  Roman  spirit had double cause to mourn in private for it was not safe even to mourn in public They mourned the loss of the liberty and grandeur of  Rome  and they mourned that both should be sacrificed to wretches whose crimes would have been punished and whose talents would scarce have recommended them to the meanest offices in the virtuous and prosperous state of the commonwealth  Into such a state at least into a state as miserable as this will the people of  Britain  both fall and deserve to fall if they suffer under any pretence or by any hands that constitution to be destroyed which cannot be destroyed unless they suffer it  unless they cooperate with the enemies of it by renewing an exploded distinction of parties by electing those to represent them who are hired to betray them or by submitting tamely when the mask is taken off or falls off and the attempt to bring beggary or slavery is avowed or can be no longer concealed If ever this happens the friends of liberty should any such remain will have one option still left and they will rather choose no doubt to die the last of  British  freemen than bear to live the first of  British  slaves  IBID  THE EPILOGUE TO THE DISSERTATION ON PARTIES  A CERTAIN pragmatical fellow in a certain village took it into his head to write the names of the 'Squire of all his family of the principal parish officers and of some of the notable members of the vestry in the margin of  The Whole Duty of Man  overagainst every sin which he found mentioned in that most excellent treatise The clamour was great and all the neighbourhood was in an uproar At last the minister was called in upon this great emergency He heard them with patience with so much that he brought them to talk one after the other When he had heard them he pronounced that they were all in the wrong that the book was written against sins of all kinds whoever should be guilty of them  but that the innocent would give occasion to unjust suspicions by all this clamour and that the guilty would convict themselves They took his advice  The Whole Duty of Man  hath been read ever since with much edification by all the parishioners The innocent have been most certainly confirmed in virtue and we hope the guilty have been reformed from vice  THE WORST MINISTERS COULD DO LITTLE MISCHIEF BUT FOR THE PROFLIGACY OF THE PEOPLE  THERE have been monsters in other ages and other countries as well as ours but they have never continued their devastations long when there were heroes to oppose them We will suppose a man impudent rash presumptuous ungracious insolent and profligate in speculation as well as practice he can bribe but he cannot seduce he can buy but he cannot gain he can lie but he cannot deceive From whence then has such a man his strength From the general corruption of the people nursed up to a full maturity under his administration from the venality of all orders and all ranks of men some of whom are so prostitute that they set themselves to sale and even prevent application  THE SPIRIT OF PATRIOTISM  MINISTERIAL FACTION  MINISTERIAL factions would have as little ability to do hurt as they have inclination to do good if they were not formed and conducted by one of better parts than they nor would such a minister be able to support at the head of this trusty phalanx the ignominious tyranny imposed on his country if other men of better parts and much more consequence than himself were not drawn in to misapply these parts to the vilest drudgery imaginable the daily drudgery of explaining nonsense covering ignorance disguising folly concealing and even justifying fraud and corruption instead of employing their knowledge their elocution their skill experience and authority to correct the administration and to guard the constitution  IBID  THE SITE OF VIRTUE  VIRTUE  is not placed on a rugged mountain of difficult and dangerous access as they who would excuse the indolence of their temper or the perverseness of their will desire to have it believed but she is seated however on an  eminence  We may go up to her with ease but we must go up  gradually  according to the natural progression of  Reason  who is to lead the way and to guide our steps On the other hand if we fall from thence we are sure to be hurried down the hill with a  blind impetuosity according to the natural violence of those  appetites and passions  that caused our fall at first and urge it on the faster the further they are removed from the controul that before restrained them  IDEA OF A PATRIOT KING  A PATRIOT KING THE PUBLIC SAVIOUR  DISTRESS from abroad bankruptcy at home and other circumstances of like nature and tendency may beget universal confusion Out of confusion order may arise but it may be the order of a wicked tyranny instead of the order of a just monarchy Either may happen and such an alternative at the disposition of fortune is sufficient to make a Stoic tremble We may be saved indeed by means of a very different kind but these means will not offer themselves this way of salvation will not be opened to us without the concurrence and the influence of a  patriot King  the most uncommon of all phaenomena in the physical or moral world  IBID  GOOD GOVERNMENT ONLY A DIVINE RIGHT  A PEOPLE may choose or hereditary right may raise a bad Prince to the throne but a good King alone can derive his right to govern from God The reason is plain good government  alone can be in the divine intention God has made us to desire happiness he has made our happiness dependent on society and the happiness of society dependent on good or bad government His intention therefore was that government should be  good  IBID  LIMITED MONARCHY  THIS I presume to say and can demonstrate that all the limitations necessary to preserve liberty as long as the spirit of it subsists and longer than that no limitations of monarchy nor any other form of government can preserve it are compatible with monarchy I think on these subjects neither as the Tories nor as the Whigs have thought at least I endeavour to avoid the excesses of both I neither  dress  up  Kings  like so many  burlesque Jupiters  weighing the fortunes of mankind in the scales of Fate darting thunderbolts at the heads of rebellious giants nor do I strip them  naked  as it were and leave them at most a few  tattered rags  to clothe their  majesty  but such as can serve really as little for use as for ornament My aim is to six this principle that  limitations  on a crown ought to be carried  as far  as it is necessary to secure the liberties of a people and that all  such limitations  may subsist without weakening or endangering monarchy  IBID  THE USE TO BE MADE OF A GOOD REIGN  ALL that can be done to prolong the duration of a good government is to draw it back on every favourable occasion to the first good principles on which it was founded When these occasions happen often and are well improved such governments are prosperous and durable And improved in this manner they will certainly be under the reign of every true  patriot King  like snatches of fair weather at sea to repair the damages sustained in the last storm and to prepare it to resist the next For such a King cannot secure to his people a succession of Princes like himself He will do all he can towards it by his example and by his instruction But after all the royal mantle will not convey the spirit of patriotism into another King as the mantle of  Elijah  did the gift of prophecy into another prophet The utmost he can do and that which deserves the utmost gratitude from his subjects is to restore good government to revive the spirit of it and to maintain and confirm both during the whole course of his reign The rest his people must do for themselves if they do not they will have none but themselves to blame if they do they will have the principal obligation to him In all events they will have been freemen one reign the longer by his means and perhaps more since he will leave them much  better prepared and disposed to defend their liberties than he found them  IBID  THE COURT OF A GOOD KING REFORMED  HIS first care will no doubt be to purge his court The men in power will be some of those adventurers busy and bold who thrust and crowd themselves early into the intrigue of party and the management of affairs of state often without true ability always without true ambition or even the appearance of virtue who mean nothing more than what is called making a fortune the acquisition of wealth to satisfy  avarice  and of titles and ribbands to satisfy vanity Such as these are sure to be employed by a weak or a wicked King They impose on the first and are chosen by the last Nor is it marvellous that they are so since every other want is supplied in them by the want of good principles and a good conscience and since these defects become ministerial perfections in a reign when measures are pursued and designs carried on that every honest man will disapprove All the prostitutes who set themselves to sale all the locusts who devour the land with crowds of spies parasites and sycophants will surround the throne under the patronage of such ministers and whole swarms of little noisome nameless infects will hum and buzz in every corner of the court Such ministers will be cast off and such abettors  of ministry will be chaced away together and at once by a  patriot King  Some of them perhaps will be abandoned by him not to party fury but to national justice not to sate private resentments and to serve particular interests but to make satisfaction for wrongs done to their country and to stand as examples of terror to future administrations Clemency makes no doubt an amiable part of the character I attempt to draw but clemency to be a virtue must have its bounds like other virtues and surely these bounds are extended enough by a maxim I have read somewhere  that frailties and even vices may be passed over but not enormous crimes  IBID  MERE COURTIERS  AMONG the bad company with which such a court will abound may be reckoned a sort of men too low to be much regarded and too high to be quite neglected the lumber of every administration the furniture of every court These gilt carved things are seldom answerable for more than the men on a chessboard who are moved about at will and on whom the conduct of the game is not to be charged Some of these every prince must have about him The pageantry of a court requires that he should and this pageantry like many other despicable things ought not to be laid aside But as much sameness as there may appear in the characters of this sort of men there  is one distinction that will be made whenever a good prince succeeds to the throne after an iniquitous administration the distinction I mean is between those who have affected to dip themselves deeply in precedent iniquities and those who have had the virtue to keep aloof from them or the good luck not to be called to any share in them  IBID  WISDOM AND CUNNING DISTINGUISHED  MY Lord  Bacon  says that  cunning is lefthanded or crooked wisdom  I would rather say that it is a part but the lowest part of wisdom employed alone by some because they have not the other parts to employ and by some because it is as much as they want within those bounds of action which they prescribe to themselves and sufficient to the ends that they propose The difference seems to consist in degree and application rather than in kind Wisdom is neither  lefthanded  nor  crooked  but the heads of some men contain little and the hearts of others employ it wrong To use my Lord  Bacon  's own comparison the cunning man knows how to pack the cards the wise man how to play the game better but it would be of no use to the first to pack the cards if his knowledge stopped here and he had no skill in the game nor to the second to play the game better if he did not know how to pack the cards that he  might unpack them by new shuffling Inferior wisdom or cunning may get the better of folly but superior wisdom will get the better of cunning Wisdom and cunning have often the same objects but a wise man will have more and greater in his view The least will not fill his soul nor ever become the principal theme but will be pursued in subserviency in subordination at least to the other Wisdom and cunning may employ sometimes the same means too but the wise man stoops to these means and the other cannot rise above them  IBID  SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION  SIMULATION and dissimulation are the chief arts of cunning the first will be esteemed always by a wise man unworthy of him and will be therefore avoided by him in every possible case for simulation is put on that we may look into the cards of another whereas dissimulation intends nothing more than to hide our own Simulation is a stiletto not only an offensive but an unlawful weapon and the use of it may be rarely very rarely excused but never justified Dissimulation is a shield as secrecy is armour and it is no more possible to preserve secrecy in the administration of public affairs without some degree of dissimulation than it is to succced in it without secrecy  Those two arts of cunning are like the alloy mingled with pure ore a little is necessary and will  not debase the coin below its proper standard but if more than that little be employed the coin loses its currency and the coiner his credit  IBID  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CUNNING AND A WISE MINISTER  THE cunning minister neither sees nor is concerned to see any further than his personal interest and the support of his administration require If such a man overcomes any actual difficulty avoids any immediate distress or without doing either of these effectually gains a little time by all the low artifice which cunning is ready to suggest and baseness of mind to employ he triumphs and is flattered by his mercenary train on the great event which amounts often to no more than this that he got into distress by one series of faults and out of it by another The wise minister sees and is concerned to see further because government has a further concern he sees the objects that are distant as well as those that are near and all their remote relations and even their indirect tendencies He thinks of same as well as applause and prefers that which to be enjoyed must be given to that which may be bought He considers his administration as a single day in the great year of government but as a day that is affected by those which went before and that must affect those which are to follow He combines therefore  and compares all these objects relations and tendencies and the judgment he makes on an entire not a partial survey of them is the rule of his conduct That scheme of the reason of state which lies open before a wise minister contains all the great principles of government and all the great interests of his country so that as he prepares some events he prepares against others whether they be likely to happen during his administration or in some future time  IBID  AN ANECDOTE  HENRY the Fourth  of  France  asked a  Spanish  ambassador What mistresses the King of  Spain  had The ambassador replied like a formal pedant That his master was a Prince who feared God and had no mistress but the Queen  Henry the Fourth  felt the reflection and asked him in return with some contempt "Whether his master had not virtues enough to cover one vice"  IBID  THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION OF ENGLAND FRANCE AND THE UNITED PROVINCES  THE situation of  GreatBritain  the character of her people and the nature of her government fit her for trade and commerce Her climate and her soil make them necessary to her wellbeing  By trade and commerce we grew a rich and powerful nation and by their decay we are growing poor and impotent As trade and commerce enrich so they fortify our country The sea is our barrier ships are our fortresses and the mariners that trade and commerce alone can furnish are the garrisons to defend them  France  lies under great disadvantages in trade and commerce by the nature of her government Her advantages in situation are as great at least as ours Those that arise from the temper and character of her people are a little different perhaps and yet upon the whole equivalent Those of her climate and her soil are superior to ours and indeed to those of any  European  nation The  United Provinces  have the same advantages that we have in the nature of their government more perhaps in the temper and character of their people less to be sure in their situation climate and soil But without descending into a longer detail of the advantages and disadvantages attending each of these nations in trade and commerce it is sufficient for my present purpose to observe that  GreatBritain  stands in a certain middle between the other two with regard to  wealth  and  power  arising from these springs A less and a less constant application to the improvement of these may serve the ends of  France  a greater is necessary in this country and a greater still in  Holland  The  French  may improve their natural wealth and power by the improvement of trade and commerce We can have no wealth nor  power by consequence as  Europe  is now constituted without the improvement of them nor in any degree but proportionably to this improvement The  Dutch  cannot subsist without them They bring wealth to other nations and are necessary to the wellbeing of them but they supply the  Dutch  with food and raiment and are necessary even to their being  The result of what has been said is in general that the wealth and power of all nations depending so much on their trade and commerce and every nation being like the three I have mentioned in such different circumstances of advantage or disadvantage in the pursuit of this common interest a good government and therefore the government of a patriot King will be directed constantly to make the most of every advantage that nature has given or art can procure towards the improvement of trade and commerce And this is one of the principal criterions by which we are to judge whether governors are in the true interest of the people or not  It results in particular that  GreatBritain  might improve her wealth and power in a proportion superior to that of any nation who can be deemed her rival if the advantages she has were as wisely cultivated as they will be in the reign of a patriot King To be convinced more thoroughly of this truth a very short process of reasoning will suffice  Let any man who has knowledge enough for it first compare the natural state of  GreatBritain  and of the  United Provinces  and then their artificial state together that is let him consider minutely the advantages we have by the situation extent and nature of our island over the inhabitants of a few saltmarshes gained on the sea and hardly defended from it and after that let him consider how nearly these provinces have raised themselves to an equality of wealth and power with the kingdom of  GreatBritain  From whence arises this difference of improvement It arises plainly from hence the  Dutch  have been from the foundation of their commonwealth a nation of  patriots  and  merchants  The spirit of that people has not been diverted from these two objects the defence of their liberty and the improvement of their trade and commerce which have been carried on by them with uninterrupted and unslackened application industry order and oeconomy  IBID  THE PRIVATE CHARACTER OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT  ALEXANDER  had violent passions and those for wine and women were predominant after his ambition They were  spots  in his character before they prevailed by the force of habit as soon as they began to do so the king and the hero appeared less the rake and bully more  Persepolis  was burnt at the instigation of  Thais  and  Clytus  was killed in a drunken brawl He repented indeed of these two horrible actions and was again the King and Hero upon many occasions but he had not been enough on his guard when the strongest incitements to vanity and to sensual pleasures offered themselves at every moment to him and when he stood in all his easy hours surrounded by women and eunuchs by the pandars parasites and buffoons of a voluptuous court they who could not approach the King approached the man and by seducing the man they betrayed the King His faults became habits The  Macedonians  who did not or would not see the one saw the other and he fell a sacrifice to their resentments to their fears and to those factions that will arise under an odious government as well as under one that grows into contempt  IBID  OF SCIPIO THE ROMAN GENERAL  OTHER characters might be brought to contrast with this the first  Scipio Africanus  for example or the eldest  Cato  and there will be no objection to a comparison of such citizens of  Rome  as these were with Kings of the first magnitude Now the reputation of the first  Scipio  was not so clear and uncontroverted in  private  as in  public  life nor was he allowed by all to be a man of such severe virtue as he affected and as that age required  Naevius  was thought to mean him in some verses  Gellius  has preserved and  Valerius Antias  made no scruple to assert that far from restoring the fair  Spaniard  to her family he debauched and kept her Notwithstanding this what authority did he not maintain In what esteem and veneration did he not live and die With what panegyrics has not the whole torrent of writers rolled down his reputation even to these days This could not have happened if the vice imputed to him had shewn itself in any scandalous appearances to eclipse the lustre of the general the consul or the citizen The same reflection might be extended to  Cato  who loved wine as well as  Scipio  loved women Men did not judge in the days of the elder  Cato  perhaps as  Seneca  was ready to do in those of the younger that drunkenness could be no crime if  Cato  drank but  Cato  's passion as well as that of  Scipio  was subdued and kept under by his public character His virtue warmed instead of cooling by this indulgence to his genius or natural temper and one may gather from what  Tully  puts into his mouth in the treatise concerning oldage that even his love of wine was rendered subservient instead of doing hurt to the measures he pursued in his public character  IBID  OF THE FIRST TWO CAESARS AND MARC ANTHONY  OLD  Curio  called  Julius Caesar  the husband of every wife and the wife of every husband referring  to his own adulteries and to the compliances that he was suspected of in his youth for  Nicomedes  Even his own soldiers in the licence of a triumph sung lampoons on him for his profusion as well as lewdness The youth of  Augustus  was defamed as much as that of  Julius Caesar  and both as much as that of  Anthony  When  Rome  was ransacked by the pandars of  Augustus  and matrons and virgins were stripped and searched like slaves in a market to choose the fittest to satisfy his lust did  Anthony  do more When  Julius  set no bounds to his debauches in  Egypt  except those that satiety imposed  postquam epulis bacchoque modum lassata voluptas imposuit  when he trifled away his time with  Cleopatra  in the very crisis of the civil war and till his troops refused to follow him any further in his effeminate progress up the  Nile  did  Anthony  do more No all three had vices which would have been so little borne in any former age of  Rome  that no man could have raised himself under the weight of them to popularity and to power But we must not wonder that the people who bore the  tyrants  bore the  libertines  nor that indulgence was shewn to the vices of the great in a city where universal corruption and profligacy of manners were established and yet even in this city and among these degenerate  Romans  certain it is that different appearances with the same vices helped to maintain the  Caesars  and ruined  Anthony  IBID  OF LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH  LEWIS  the Fourteenth was King in an absolute monarchy and reigned over a people whose genius makes it as fit perhaps to impose on them by admiration and awe as to gain and hold them by affection Accordingly he kept great state was haughty was reserved and all he said or did appeared to be forethought and planned His regard to appearances was such that when his mistress was the wife of another man and he had children by her every year he endeavoured to cover her constant residence at court by a place she filled about the Queen and he dined and supped and cohabited with the latter in every apparent respect as if he had no mistress at all Thus he raised a great reputation he was revered by his subjects and admired by his neighbours and this was due principally to the art with which he managed appearances so as to set off his virtues to disguise his failings and his vices and by his example and authority to keep a veil drawn over the futility and debauch of his court  IBID  OF QUEEN ELIZABETH  OUR  Elizabeth  was Queen in a limited monarchy and reigned over a people at all times more easily led than driven and at that time capable of being attached to their prince and their country by a more generous principle than any of those  which prevail in our days by  affection  There was a strong  prerogative  then in being and the crown was in possession of greater legal power Popularity was however then as it is now and as it must be always in mixed government the sole true foundation of that sufficient authority and influence which other constitutions give the Prince  gratis  and and  independently  of the people but which a King of this nation must  acquire  The wise Queen saw it and she saw too how much popularity depends on those appearances that depend on the decorum the decency the grace and the propriety of behaviour of which we were speaking A warm concern for the interest and honour of the nation a tenderness for her people and a confidence in their affections were appearances that run through her whole public conduct and gave life and colour to it She did great things and she knew how to set them off according to their full value by her manner of doing them In her  private behaviour  she shewed great affability she descended even to familiarity but her familiarity was such as could not be imputed to her  weakness  and was therefore most justly ascribed to her  goodness  Though a woman she hid all that was womanish about her and if a few equivocal marks of coquettry appeared on some occasions they passed like flashes of lightning vanished as soon as they were discerned and imprinted no blot on her character She had private  friendships  she had  favourites  but she never suffered her  friends  to forget she was their  Queen and when her  favourites  did she made them feel that she was so  IBID  OF JAMES THE FIRST  HER successor had no virtues to set off but he had failings and vices to conceal He could not conceal the latter and void of the former he could not compensate for them His failings and his vices therefore standing in full view he passed for a weak Prince and an ill Man and fell into all the contempt wherein his memory remains to this day The methods he took to preserve himself from it served but to confirm him in it No man can keep the decorum of manners in life who is not free from every kind of  affectation  as it has been said already but he who affects what he has no pretensions to or what is improper to his character and rank in the world is guilty of most consummate folly he becomes doubly ungracious doubly indecent and quite ridiculous  James  the First not having one quality to conciliate the esteem or affection of his people to him endeavoured to impose on their understandings and to create a respect for himself by spreading the most extravagant notions about  Kings  in general as if they were  middle beings  between God and other men and by comparing the extent and  nsearchable mysteries of their  power  and  prerogative  to those of the divine providence His  language  and his  behaviour  were commonly suited to such foolish pretensions and thus by assuming  a claim to such respect and submission as were not due to him he lost a great part of what was due to him In short he began at the wrong end for though the shining qualities of the King may cover some failings and some vices that do not grow up to strong habits in the Man yet must the character of a  great  and  good King  be founded in that of a  great  and a  good Man  A King who lives out of the sight of his subjects or is never seen by them except on his throne can scarce be despised as a Man though he may be hated as a King But the King who lives more in their sight and more under their observation may be despised before he is hated and even without being hated This happened to King  James  a thousand circumstances brought it to pass and none more than the  indecent weaknesses  he had for his  minions  He did not endeavour to cure this contempt and raise his character only by affecting what he had no pretensions to as in the former case but he endeavoured likewise most vainly to do it by affecting what was improper to his character and rank He did not endeavour indeed to disguise his natural  pusillanimity  and  timidity  under the mask of a bully whilst he was imposed upon and insulted by all his neighbours and above all by the  Spaniards  but he retailed the scraps of  Buchanan  affected to talk much figured in church controversies and put on all the pedantic appearances of a scholar whilst he neglected all those of a great and good Man as well as King  IBID  THE PICTURE OF A PATRIOT REIGN  ON this subject let the imagination range through the whole glorious scene of a patriot reign the beauty of the idea will inspire those transports which  Plato  imagined the vision of virtue would inspire if virtue could be seen What in truth can be so lovely what so venerable as to contemplate a King on whom the eyes of a whole people are fixed filled with admiration and glowing with affection a King in the temper of whose government like that of  Nerva  things so seldom allied as empire and liberty are intimately mixed coexist together inseparably and constitute one real essence What spectacle can be presented to the view of the mind so rare so nearly divine as a King possessed of absolute power neither usurped by fraud nor maintained by force but the genuine effect of esteem of confidence and affection the free gift of  Liberty  who finds her greatest security in this power and would desire no other if the Prince on the throne could be what his people wish him to be immortal Of such a Prince and of such a Prince alone it may be said with strict propriety and truth  Volentes per Populos dat jura viamque affectat Olympi  Civil fury will have no place in this draught or if the monster is seen he must be seen as  Virgil  describes him  Centum vinctus catenis Post tergum nodis fremit horridus ore cruento  He must be seen subdued bound chained and deprived entirely of power to do hurt In this place concord will appear brooding peace and prosperity on the happy land joy sitting in every face content in every heart a people unoppressed undisturbed unalarmed busy to improve their private property and the public stock fleets covering the ocean bringing home wealth by the returns of industry carrying assistance or terror abroad by the direction of wisdom and asserting triumphantly the right and the honour of  Great Britain  as far as waters roll and as winds can waft them  IBID  GENERAL MAXIMS  THE minister who grows less by his elevation is like a little statue placed on a mighty pedestal  I cannot help being surprised that a man should expect to be trusted with a crown because he is born a prince in a country where he could not be trusted by law with a constable's staff if only born a private person  Ministers who punish what they might prevent are more culpable than those who offend  When a free people crouch like camels to be loaded the next at hand no matter who mounts them and they soon feel the whip and spur of their tyrant  A tyrant whether prince or minister resembles the devil in many respects particularly in this He is often both the tempter and tormentor he makes the criminal and he punishes the crime  To know when to yield in government is at least as necessary as to know when to lose in trade and he who cannot do the first is so little likely to govern a kingdom well that it is more than probable he would govern a shop ill  Experience continually shews us that they who made kings what they are are apt to take them for what they are not  The very same minister who exalts his master's throne on the ruins of the constitution that he may govern without controul or retire without danger would do just the reverse if any turn of affairs enabled him to compound in that manner the better for himself  The laughers are for those who have most wit and the serious part of mankind for those who have most reason on their side  There is a plain and real difference between jealousy and distrust Men may be jealous on account of their liberties even when they have no immediate distrust that the persons who govern design to invade them  It would be highly unjust to impute the scurrilities of scurrilous authors to any prompter because they have in themselves all that is necessary to constitute a scold ill manners impudence a soul mouth and a fouler heart  Real friendship can never exist among those whose actions have banished virtue and truth  Whilst a great event is in suspense the action warms and the very suspense made up of hope and fear maintains no unpleasing agitation in the mind  When a house which is old and quite decayed though often repaired not only cracks but totters even from the foundation every man in his senses runs out of it and takes shelter where he can  The government of  Britain  has in some sort the appearance of an oligarchy and monarchy is rather hid behind it than shewn rather weakened than strengthened rather imposed upon than obeyed  No human institution can arrive at perfection and the most human wisdom can do is to procure the same or greater good at the expence of less evil  Cunning pays no regard to virtue and is but the low mimic of wisdom  According to the present form of our constitution every member of either House of Parliament is a member of a national standing council born or appointed by the people to promote good and to oppose bad government and if not vested with the power of a minister of state yet vested with the superior power of controuling those who are appointed such by the crown  Demosthenes  used to compare eloquence to a weapon aptly enough for eloquence like every other weapon is of little use to the owner unless he have the force and the skill to use it  No secrets are so important to be known no hearts deserve to be pried into with more curiosity and attention than those of princes  The minister preaches corruption aloud and constantly like an impudent missionary of vice and some there are who not only insinuate but teach the same occasionally  As well might we say that a ship is built and loaded and manned for the sake of any particular pilot instead of acknowledging that the pilot is made for the sake of the ship her lading and her crew who are always the  owners  in the political vessel as to say that kingdoms were instituted for kings not kings for kingdoms  Our constitution is brought or almost brought to such a point of perfection that no King who is not in the true meaning of the word a Patriot can govern  Britain  with  ease security honour dignity  or indeed with  sufficient power  and  strength  To constitute  a patriot  whether  king  or  subject  there must be something more substantial than a desire of same in the composition and if there be not this desire of fame will never rise above that sentiment which may be compared to the coquettry of women a fondness of transient applause which is courted by  vanity  given by  flattery  and spends itself in  shew  like the qualities that acquire it  Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man without liberty no happiness can be enjoyed by society  The utmost private men can do who remain untainted by the general contagion  in a degenerate  age  is to keep the spirit of liberty alive in a few breasts to protest against what they cannot hinder and to claim on every occasion what they cannot by their own strength recover  A standing parliament is in the nature of it as dangerous as a standing army and may become in some conjunctures much more fatal to liberty  The sight of the mind differs very much from the sight of the body and its operations are frequently the reverse of the other objects at a distance are seen but imperfectly by the latter while they appear to the former in their true magnitude and diminish as they are brought nearer  Tyranny and slavery do not so properly consist in the stripes that are given as in the power of giving them at pleasure and the necessity of receiving them whenever and for whatever they are inflicted  The collective body of the people of  GreatBritain  delegate but do not give up trust but do not alienate their right and their power and cannot be undone by having beggary or slavery brought upon them unless they cooperate to their own undoing or in one word betray themselves  He who undertakes to govern a free people by corruption and to lead them by a false interest against their true interest cannot boast the honour of the invention the expedient is as old as the world and he can pretend to no other honour than that of being an humble imitator of the devil  Fortune maintains a kind of rivalship with Wisdom and piques herself often in favour of fools as well as knaves  Neither  Montagne  in writing his Essays nor  Des Cartes  in building new worlds nor  Burnet  in framing an antediluvian earth no nor  Newton  in discovering and establishing the true laws of nature on experiment and a sublime geometry felt more intellectual joys than he feels who is a real  patriot  who bends all the force of his understanding and directs all his thoughts and actions to the good of his country  Eloquence that leads mankind by the ears gives a nobler superiority than power that every dunce may use or fraud that every knave may employ to lead them by the nose But eloquence must flow like a stream that is fed by an abundant spring and not spout forth a little frothy water on some gaudy day and remain dry the rest of the year  The true image of a free people governed by a  patriot King  is that of a patriarchal family where the head and all the members are united by one common interest and animated by one common spirit and where if any are perverse enough to have another they will be soon borne down by the superiority of those who have the same and far from making a division they will but confirm the union of the little state  Faction is to party what the  superlative  is to the  positive  party is a political evil and faction is the worst of all evils  Parties even before they degenerate into absolute factions are still numbers of men associated together for certain purposes and certain interests which are not or which are not allowed to be those of the community by others  From the misapplication of superior parts to the hurt no argument can be drawn against this position that they were given for the good of mankind  In our country many undertake opposition not as a  duty  but as an  adventure  and looking on themselves like  volunteers  not like men  enlisted  in the service they deem themselves at liberty to take as much or as little of this trouble and to  continue in it as long or end it as soon as they please  Superior talents and superior rank among our fellow creatures whether acquired by birth or by the course of accidents and the success of our own industry are noble prerogatives but shall he who possesses them repine at the obligations they lay him under of passing his whole life in the noblest occupation of which human nature is capable  A life dedicated to the service of our country admits the full use and no life should admit the abuse of pleasures the least are consistent with a constant discharge of our public duty the greatest arise from it  Cato  's virtue often glowed with wine and the love of women did not hinder  Caesar  from forming and executing the greatest projects that ambition ever suggested  Our's does all that a constitution can do all that can be done by legal provisions to secure the interests of the people by maintaining the integrity of their trustees and lest all this should fail it gives frequent opportunities to the people to secure their interest themselves by mending their choice so that as a bad king must stand in awe of an honest parliament a corrupt house of  commons must stand in awe of an honest people  Danger commences when the breach is made not when the attack is begun He who neglects to stop the leak as soon as it is discovered in hopes to save his ship by pumping when the water gushes in by violence deserves to be drowned Our constitution is not like the schemes of some politicians a jumble of disjointed incoherent whimsies but a noble and wise system the essential parts of which are so proportioned and so intimately connected that a change in one begets a change in the whole  A free people may be sometimes betrayed but no people will betray themselves and sacrifice their liberty unless they fall into a state of universal corruption and when they are once fallen into such a state they will be sure to lose what they deserve no longer to enjoy  Whatever political speculations instead of preparing us to be useful to society and to promote the happiness of mankind are only systems for gratifying private ambition and promoting private interests at the public expence deserve to be burnt and the authors of them to starve like  Machiavel  in a jail  In all respects a wise man looks on himself as a citizen of the world and when you ask him where his country lies points like  Anaxagoras  to the heavens  Naked facts without the causes that produced them and the circumstances that accompanied them are not sufficient to characterise actions or counsels  The powers of earth like those of heaven have two distinct motions Each of them rolls in his own political orb but each of them is hurried at the same time round the great vortex of his religion  Wise men are able to do a great deal with a little every knave or fool is ready to do a little with a great deal  The landed men are the true owners of our political vessel the monied men as such are no more than passengers in it  I never met the mad woman at  Brentford  decked out in old and new rags and nice and fantastical in the manner of wearing them without reflecting on many of the profound scholars and sublime philosophers of our own and of former ages  The ocean which environs us is an emblem of our government and the pilot and the minister are in similar circumstances  You know the nature of that assembly the House of Commons they grow like hound  fond of the man who shews them game and by whose halloo they are used to be encouraged  The merit of preserving our country from beggary is little inferior to that of preserving it from slavery  Similis  a captain of great reputation under  Trajan  and  Adrian  having obtained leave to retire passed seven years in his retreat and then dying ordered this inscription to be put on his tombThat he had been many years on earth but that he had lived only seven  Regret your separation from your friends but regret it like a man who deserves to be theirs This is strength not weakness of mind it is virtue not vice  Truth lies within a little and certain compass but error is immense  When virtue has steeled the mind on every side we are invulnerable on every side but  Achilles  was wounded in the heel  Every thing becomes intolerable to the man who is once subdued by grief  Brutus  thought it enough that those who go into banishment cannot be hindered from carrying their virtue along with them  The world is a great wilderness wherein mankind have wandered and jostled one another about from the beginning of the creation Some have removed by necessity and others by choice One nation has been fond of seising what another was tired of possessing and it will be difficult to point out the country which is to this day in the hands of its original inhabitants  No man suffers by bad fortune but he who has been deceived by good  The citizens of  Rome  placed the images of their ancestors in the vestibules of their houses so that whenever they went in or out these venerable bustos met their eyes and recalled the glorious actions of the dead to fire the living to excite them to imitate and even to emulate their great forefathers The success answered the design The virtue of one generation was transfused by the magic of example into several and a spirit of heroism was maintained through many ages of that commonwealth  We are apt to carry systems of philosophy beyond all our ideas and systems of history beyond all our memorials  There cannot be a greater absurdity than to affirm that the people have a remedy in resistance when their prince attempts to enslave them but that they have none when their representatives sell themselves and them  The obligations under which we lie to serve our country increase in proportion to the ranks we hold and the other circumstances of birth fortune and situation that call us to this service and above all to the talents which God has given us to perform it  Every man's reason is every man's oracle  To set about acquiring the habits of meditation and study late in life is like getting into a gocart with a grey beard and learning to walk when we have lost the use of our legs  Uninterrupted misery has this good effect as it continually torments it finally hardens  He must blush to sink under the anguish of one wound who surveys a body seamed over with the scars of many  Nature and truth are the same every where and reason shews them every where alike  HISTORY THE UNIVERSAL TASTE  THE love of history seems inseparable from human nature because it seems inseparable from selflove The same principle in this instance carries us forward and backward to future and to past ages We imagine that the things which affect us must affect posterity this sentiment runs through mankind from  Caesar  down to the parishclerk in  Pope's  Miscellany We are fond of preserving as far as it is in our frail power the memory of our own adventures of those of our own time and of those that preceded it Rude heaps of stones have been raised and ruder hymns have been composed for this purpose by nations who had not yet the use of arts and letters To go no further back the triumphs of  Odin  were celebrated in  Runic  songs and the feats of our  British  ancestors were recorded in those of their bards The savages of  America  have the same custom at this day and long historical ballads of their huntings and their wars are sung at all their festivals There is no need of saying how this passion grows among civilized nations in proportion to the means of gratifying it but let us observe that the same principle of nature directs us as strongly and more generally as well as more early to indulge our own curiosity instead of preparing to gratify  that of others The child hearkens with delight to the tales of his nurse he learns to read and he devours with eagerness fabulous legends and novels In riper years he applies himself to history or to that which he takes for history to authorised romance and even in age the desire of knowing what has happened to other men yields to the desire alone of relating what has happened to ourselves Thus history true or false speaks to our passions always What pity is it that even the best should speak to our understandings so seldom That it does so we have none to blame but ourselves Nature has done her part She has opened this study to every man who can read and think and what she has made the most agreeable reason can make the most useful application of our minds But if we consult our reason we shall be far from following the examples of our fellowcreatures in this as in most other cases who are so proud of being rational We shall neither read to soothe our indolence nor to gratify our vanity as little shall we content ourselves to drudge like grammarians and critics that others may be able to study with greater ease and profit like philosophers and statesmen as little shall we affect the slender merit of becoming great scholars at the expence of groping all our lives in the dark mazes of antiquity All these mistake the true drift of study and the true use of history Nature gave us curiosity to excite the industry of our minds  but she never intended it should be made the principal much less the sole object of their application The true and proper object of this application is a constant improvement in private and in public virtue An application to any study that tends neither directly nor indirectly to make us better men and better citizens is at best but a specious and ingenious sort of idleness to use an expression of  Tillotson  and the knowledge we acquire by it is a creditable kind of ignorance nothing more This creditable kind of ignorance is in my opinion the whole benefit which the generality of men even of the most learned reap from the study of history and yet the study of history seems to me of all other the most proper to train us up to private and public virtue  OF THE STUDY OF HISTORY  GENIUS HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE  THE school of example is the world and the masters of this school are history and experience I am far from contending that the former is preferable to the latter I think upon the whole otherwise but this I say that the former is absolutely necessary to prepare us for the latter and to accompany us whilst we are under the discipline of the latter that is through the whole course of our lives No doubt some few men may be quoted to whom nature gave what art and industry can  give to no man But such examples will prove nothing against me because I admit that the study of history without experience is insufficient but assert that experience itself is so without genius Genius is preferable to the other two but I would wish to find the three together for how great soever a genius may be and how much soever he may acquire new light and heat as he proceeds in his rapid course certain it is that he will never shine with the full lustre nor shed the full influence he is capable of unless to his own experience he adds the experience of other men and other ages Genius without the improvement at least of experience is what comets once were thought to be a blazing meteor irregular in his course and dangerous in his approach of no use to any system and able to destroy any Mere sons of earth if they have experience without any knowledge of the history of the world are but half scholars in the science of mankind And if they are conversant in history without experience they are worse than ignorant they are pedants always incapable sometimes meddling and presuming The man who has all three is an honour to his country and a public blessing  IBID  EXAMPLE  THERE is scarce any folly or vice more epidemical among the sons of men than that ridiculous and hurtful vanity by which the people of each country are apt to prefer themselves to those of every other and to make their own customs and manners and opinions the standards of right and wrong of true and false The  Chinese  Mandarins were strangely surprised and almost incredulous when the  Jesuits  shewed them how small a figure their empire made in the general map of the world The  Samojedes  wondered much at the Czar of  Muscovy  for not living among them and the  Hottentott  who returned from  Europe  stripped himself naked as soon as he came home put on his bracelets of guts and garbage and grew stinking and lousy as fast as he could Now nothing can contribute more to prevent us from being tainted with this vanity than to accustom ourselves early to contemplate the different nations of the earth in that vast map which history spreads before us in their rise and their fall in their barbarous and civilized states in the likeness and unlikeness of them all to one another and of each to itself By frequently renewing this prospect to the mind the  Mexican  with his cap and coat of feathers sacrificing a human victim to his god will not appear more savage to our eyes than the  Spaniard  with an hat on his head and a gonilla  round his neck sacrificing whole nations to his ambition his avarice and even the wantonness of his cruelty I might shew by a multitude of other examples how history prepares us for experience and guides us in it and many of these would be both curious and important I might likewise bring several other instances wherein history serves to purge the mind of those national partialities and prejudices that we are apt to contract in our education and that experience for the most part rather confirms than removes because it is for the most part confined like our education  IBID  HISTORICAL EXAMPLE ENTIRE  THE examples which history presents to us both of men and of events are generally complete the whole example is before us and consequently the whole lesson or sometimes the various lessons which philosophy proposes to teach us by this example For first as to men we see them at their whole length in history and we see them generally there through a medium less partial at least than that of experience for I imagine that a Whig or a Tory whilst those parties subsisted would have condemned in  Saturninus  the spirit of faction which he applauded in his own tribunes and would have applauded in  Drusus  the spirit of moderation which he despised in those  of the contrary party and which he suspected and hated in those of his own party The villain who has imposed on mankind by his power or cunning and whom experience could not unmask for a time is unmasked at length and the honest man who has been misunderstood or defamed is justified before his story ends Or if this does not happen if the villain dies with his mask on in the midst of applause and honour and wealth and power and if the honest man dies under the same load of calumny and disgrace under which he lived driven perhaps into exile and exposed to want yet we see historical justice executed the name of one branded with infamy and that of the other celebrated with panegyric to succeeding ages  IBID  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE  THUS again as to events that stand recorded in history we see them all we see them as they followed one another or as they produced one another causes or effects immediate or remote We are cast back as it were into former ages we live with the men who lived before us and we inhabit countries that we never saw Place is enlarged and time prolonged in this manner so that the man who applies himself early to the study of history may acquire in a few years and before he sets his foot abroad in the world not  only a more extended knowledge of mankind but the experience of more centuries than any of the patriarchs saw The events we are witnesses of in the course of the longest life appear to us very often original unprepared single and unrelative if I may use such an expression for want of a better in  English  in  French  I would say  isolés  they appear such very often are called accidents and looked upon as the effects of chance a word by the way which is in constant use and has no determinate meaning We get over the present difficulty we improve the momentary advantage as well as we can and we look no farther Experience can carry us no farther for experience can go a very little way back in discovering causes and effects are not the objects of experience till they happen From hence many errors in judgment and by consequence in condust necessarily arise And here too lies the difference we are speaking of between history and experience The advantage on the side of the former is double In ancient history as we have said already the examples are complete which are incomplete in the course of experience The beginning the progression and the end appear not of particular reigns much less of particular enterprises or systems of policy alone but of governments of nations of empires and of all the various systems that have succeeded one another in the course of their duration In modern history the examples may be and sometimes are incomplete  but they have this advantage when they are so that they serve to render complete the examples of our own time Experience is doubly defective we are born too late to see the beginning and we die too soon to see the end of many things History supplies both these defects Modern history shews the causes when experience presents the effects alone and ancient history enables us to guess at the effects when experience presents the causes alone  IBID  EDUCATION  WHAT now is education that part that principal and most neglected part of it I mean which tends to form the moral character It is I think an institution designed to lead men from their tender years by precept and example by argument and authority to the practice and to the habit of practising these rules The stronger our appetites desires and passions are the harder indeed is the task of education but when the efforts of education are proportioned to this strength although our keenest appetites and desires and our ruling passions cannot be reduced to a quiet and uniform submission yet are not their excesses assuaged are not their abuses and misapplications in some degree diverted or checked Though the pilot cannot lay the storm cannot he carry the ship by his art better through it  and often prevent the wreck that would always happen without him If  Alexander  who loved wine and was naturally choleric had been bred under the severity of  Roman  discipline it is probable he would neither have made a bonfire of  Persepolis  for his whore nor have killed his friend If  Scipio  who was naturally given to women for which anecdote we have if I mistake not the authority of  Polybius  as well as some verses of  Naevius  preserved by  A Gellius  had been educated by  Olympias  at the court of  Philip  it is improbable that he would have restored the beautiful  Spaniard  In short if the renowned  Socrates  had not corrected nature by art this first apostle of the Gentiles had been a very profligate fellow by his own confession for he was inclined to all the vices  Zopyrus  imputed to him as they say on the observation of his physiognomy  With him therefore who denies the effects of education it would be in vain to dispute and with him who admits them there can be no dispute concerning that share which I ascribe to the study of history in forming our moral characters and making us better men The very persons who pretend that inclinations cannot be restrained nor habits corrected against our natural bent would be the first perhaps to prove in certain cases the contrary A fortune at court or the favours of a lady have prevailed on many to conceal and they could not conceal without restraining  which is one step towards correcting the vices they were by nature addicted to the most Shall we imagine now that the beauty of virtue and the deformity of vice the charms of a bright and lasting reputation the terror of being delivered over as criminals to all posterity the real benefit arising from a conscientious discharge of the duty we owe to others which benefit fortune can neither hinder nor take away and the reasonableness of conforming ourselves to the designs of God manifested in the constitution of the human nature shall we imagine I say that all these are not able to acquire the same power over those who are continually called upon to a contemplation of them and they who apply themselves to the study of history are so called upon as other motives mean and sordid in comparison of these can usurp on other men  IBID  A LITERARY MONSTER  HISTORY must have a certain degree of probability and authenticity or the examples we find in it will not carry a force sufficient to make due impressions on our minds nor to illustrate nor to strengthen the precepts of philosophy and the rules of good policy But besides when histories have this necessary authenticity and probability there is much discernment to be employed in the choice and the use we make of them Some are to be  read some are to be studied and some may be neglected entirely not only without detriment but with advantage Some are the proper objects of one man's curiosity some of others and some of all men's but all history is not an object of curiosity for any man He who improperly wantonly and absurdly makes it so indulges a sort of canine appetite the curiosity of one like the hunger of the other devours ravenously and without distinction whatever falls in its way but neither of them digests They heap crudity upon crudity and nourish and improve nothing but their distemper Some such characters I have known though it is not the most common extreme into which men are apt to fall One of them I knew in this country He joined to a more than athletic strength of body a prodigious memory and to both a prodigious industry He had read almost constantly twelve or fourteen hours a day for fiveandtwenty or thirty years and had heaped together as much learning as could be crouded into an head In the course of my acquaintance with him I consulted him once or twice not oftener for I found this mass of learning of as little use to me as to the owner The man was communicative enough but nothing was distinct in his mind How could it be otherwise he had never spared time to think all was employed in reading His reason had not the merit of common mechanism When you press a watch or pull a clock they answer your question with  precision for they repeat exactly the hour of the day and tell you neither more nor less than you desire to know But when you asked this man a question he overwhelmed you by pouring forth all that the several terms or words of your question recalled to his memory and if he omitted any thing it was that very thing to which the sense of the whole question should have led him and confined him To ask him a question was to wind up a spring in his memory that rattled on with vast rapidity and confused noise till the force of it was spent and you went away with all the noise in your ears stunned and uninformed  IBID  REASON AND INSTINCT  THE far greatest part of mankind appears reduced to a lower state than other animals in that very respect on account of which we claim so great superiority over them because instinct that has its due effect is preferable to reason that has not I suppose in this place with philosophers and the vulgar that which I am in no wise ready to affirm that other animals have no share of human reason for let me say by the way it is much more likely other animals should share the human which is denied than that man should share the divine reason which is affirmed But supposing our monopoly of reason would not your lordship chuse to walk upon four legs to wear a  long tail and to be called a beast with the advantage of being determined by irresistible and unerring instinct to those truths that are necessary to your wellbeing rather than to walk on two legs to wear no tail and to be honoured with the title of man at the expence of deviating from them perpetually Instinct acts spontaneously whenever its action is necessary and directs the animal according to the purpose for which it was implanted in him Reason is a nobler and more extensive faculty for it extends to the unnecessary as well as necessary and to satisfy our curiosity as well as our wants but reason must be excited or she will remain unactive she must be left free or she will conduct us wrong and carry us farther astray from her own precincts than we should go without her help in the first case we have no sufficient guide and in the second the more we employ our reason the more unreasonable we are  Now if all this be so if reason has so little and ignorance passion interest and custom so much to do in forming our opinions and our habits and in directing the whole conduct of human life is it not a thing desirable by every thinking man to have the opportunity indulged to so few by the course of accidents the opportunity "secum esse et secum vivere" of living some years at least to ourselves and for ourselves in a state of freedom under the laws of reason instead of passing our whole time in a state of vassalage under  those of authority and custom Is it not worth our while to contemplate ourselves and others and all the things of this world once before we leave them through the medium of pure and if I may say so of undefiled reason Is it not worth our while to approve or condemn on our own authority what we receive in the beginning of life on the authority of other men who were not then better able to judge for us than we are now to judge for ourselves  LETTER ON THE TRUE USE OF RETIREMENT AND STUDY  ABSTRACTION FROM THE WORLD  WHILST we remain in the world we are all fettered down more or less to one common level and have neither all the leisure nor all the means and advantages to soar above it which we may procure to ourselves by breaking these fetters in retreat To talk of abstracting ourselves from matter laying aside body and being resolved as it were into pure intellect is proud metaphysical unmeaning jargon but to abstract ourselves from the prejudices and habits and pleasures and business of the world is no more than many are though all are not capable of doing They who can do this may elevate their souls in retreat to an higher station and may take from thence such a view of the world as the second  Scipio  took in his dream from the seats of the blessed when the whole earth appeared so little to him that he could  scarce discern that speck of dirt the  Roman  empire Such a view as this will increase our knowledge by shewing us our ignorance will distinguish every degree of probability from the lowest to the highest and mark the distance between that and certainty will dispel the intoxicating fumes of philosophical presumption and teach us to establish our peace of mind where alone it can rest securely in resignation in short such a view will render life more agreeable and death less terrible Is not this business my lord Is not this pleasure too the highest pleasure The world can afford us none such we must retire from the world to taste it with a full gust but we shall taste it the better for having been in the world  IBID  THE IMPROVEMENT OF TIME  YOUR Lordship may think this perhaps a little too sanguine for one who has lost so much time already you may put me in mind that human life has no second spring no second summer you may ask me what I mean by sowing in autumn and whether I hope to reap in winter My answer will be that I think very differently from most men of the time we have to pass and the business we have to do in this world I think we have more of one and less of the other than is commonly supposed Our want of time and the shortness of human life are some of the principal commonplace  complaints which we prefer against the established order of things they are the grumblings of the vulgar and the pathetic lamentations of the philosopher but they are impertinent and impious in both The man of business despises the man of pleasure for squandering his time away the man of pleasure pities or laughs at the man of business for the same thing and yet both concur superciliously and absurdly to find fault with the  Supreme Being  for having given them so little time The philosopher who mispends it very often as much as the others joins in the same cry and authorises this impiety  Theophrastus  thought it extremely hard to die at ninety and to go out of the world when he had just learned how to live in it His master  Aristotle  found fault with nature for treating man in this respect worse than several other animals both very unphilosophically and I love  Seneca  the better for his quarrel with the  Stagirite  on this head We see in so many instances a just proportion of things according to their several relations to one another that philosophy should lead us to conclude this proportion preserved even where we cannot discern it instead of leading us to conclude that it is not preserved where we do not discern it or where we think that we see the contrary To conclude otherwise is shocking presumption It is to presume that the system of the universe would have been more wisely contrived if creatures of our low rank among intellectual natures had been called to the councils of  the Most High or that the Creator ought to mend his work by the advice of the creature That life which seems to our selflove so short when we compare it with the ideas we frame of eternity or even with the duration of some other beings will appear sufficient upon a less partial view to all the ends of our creation and of a just proportion in the successive course of generations The term itself is long we render it short and the want we complain of flows from our profusion not from our poverty We are all arrant spend thrifts some of us dissipate our estates on the trifles some on the superfluities and then we all complain that we want the necessaries of life The much greatest part never reclaim but die bankrupts to God and man Others reclaim late and they are apt to imagine when they make up their accounts and see how their fund is diminished that they have not enough remaining to live upon because they have not the whole But they deceive themselves they were richer than they thought and they are not yet poor If they husband well the remainder it will be found sufficient for all the necessaries and for some of the superfluities and trifles too perhaps of life but then the former order of expence must be inverted and the necessaries of life must be provided before they put themselves to any cost for the trifles or superfluities  IBID  THE TRUE CURE OF AFFLICTION  DISSIPATION of mind and length of time are the remedies to which the greatest part of mankind trust in their afflictions But the first of these works a temporary the second a flow effect and both are unworthy of a wise man Are we to fly from ourselves that we may fly from our misfortunes and fondly to imagine that the disease is cured because we find means to get some moments of respite from pain Or shall we expect from time the physician of brutes a lingering and uncertain deliverance Shall we wait to be happy till we can forget that we are miserable and owe to the weakness of our faculties a tranquillity which ought to be the effect of their strength Far otherwise Let us set all our past and our present afflictions at once before our eyes Let us resolve to overcome them instead of flying from them or wearing out the sense of them by long and ignominious patience Instead of palliating remedies let us use the incisionknife and the caustic search the wound to the bottom and work an immediate and radical cure  REFLECTIONS UPON EXILE  CHANGE OF PLACE IN THE ORDER OF NATURE  There are some persons who are of opinion that as the whole universe suffers a continual rotation  and Nature seems to delight in it or to preserve herself by it so there is in the minds of men a natural restlessness which inclines them to change of place and to the shifting their habitations This opinion has at least an appearance of truth which the other  a prepossession in favour of some particular country  wants and is countenanced as the other is contradicted by experience But whatever the reasons be which must have varied infinitely in an infinite number of cases and an immense space of time true it is in fact that the families and nations of the world have been in a continual fluctuation roaming about on the face of the globe driving and driven out by turns What a number of colonies has  Asia  sent into  Europe  The  Phoenicians  planted the coast of the  Mediterranean  sea and pushed their settlements even into the Ocean The  Etrurians  were of  Asiatic  extraction and to mention no more the  Romans  those lords of the world acknowledged a  Trojan  exile for the founder of their empire How many migrations have there been in return to these from  Europe  into  Asia  They would be endless to enumerate for besides the  AEolic  the  Ionic  and others of almost equal fame the  Greeks  during several ages made continual expeditions and built cities in several parts of  Asia  The  Gauls  penetrated thither too and established a kingdom The  European Scythians  overrun these vast provinces and carried their arms to the consines of  Egypt Alexander  subdued all from the  Hellespont  to  India  and built towns  and established colonies to secure his conquests and to eternise his name From both these parts of the world  Africa  has received inhabitants and masters and what she has received she has given The  Tyrians  built the city and founded the republic of  Carthage  and  Greek  has been the language of  Egypt  In the remotest antiquity we hear of  Belus  in  Chaldaea  and of  Ses  stris  planting his tawny colonies in  Colchos  and  Spain  has been in these later ages under the dominion of the  Moors  If we turn to  Runic  history we find our fathers the  Goths  led by  Woden  and by  Thor  their heroes first and their divinities afterwards from the  Asiatic Tartary  into  Europe  and who can assure us that this was their first migration They came into  Asia  perhaps by the east from that continent to which their sons have lately sailed from  Europe  by the west and thus in the process of three or four thousand years the same race of men have pushed their conquest and their habitations round the globe at least this may be supposed as reasonably as it is supposed I think by  Grotius  that  America  was peopled from  Scandinavia  The world is a great wilderness wherein mankind have wandered and jostled one another about from the creation Some have removed by necessity and others by choice One nation has been fond of seizing what another was tired of possessing and it will be difficult to point out the country which is to this day in the hands of its first inhabitants  IBID  CONSCIOUS FREEDOM THE TRUEST DIGNITY  Believe me the providence of God has established such an order in the world that of all which belongs to us the least valuable parts can alone fall under the will of others Whatever is best is safest lies out of the reach of human power can neither be given nor taken away Such is this great and beautiful work of nature the world Such is the mind of man which contemplates and admires the world whereof it makes the noblest part These are inseparably ours and as long as we remain in one we shall enjoy the other Let us march therefore intrepidly wherever we are led by the course of human accidents Wherever they lead us on what coast soever we are thrown by them we shall not find ourselves absolutely strangers We shall meet with men and women creatures of the same figure endowed with the same faculties and born under the same laws of nature We shall see the same virtues and vices flowing from the same general principles but varied in a thousand different and contrary modes according to that infinite variety of laws and customs which is established for the same universal end the preservation of society We shall feel the same revolution of seasons and the same sun and moon will guide the course of our year The same azure vault bespangled with stars will be every where spread  over our heads There is no part of the world from whence we may not admire those planets which roll like ours in different orbits round the same central sun from whence we may not discover an object still more stupendous that army of fixed stars hung up in the immense space of the universe innumerable suns whose beams enlighten and cherish the unknown worlds which roll around them and whilst I am ravished by such contemplations as these whilst my soul is thus raised up to heaven it imports me little what ground I tread upon  IBID  POVERTY REPUTABLE  HOW great a part of mankind bear poverty with chearfulness because they have been bred in it and are accustomed to it Shall we not be able to acquire by reason and by reflection what the meanest artisan possesses by habit Shall those who have so many advantages over him be slaves to wants and necessities of which he is ignorant The rich whose wanton appetites neither the produce of one country nor of one part of the world can satisfy for whom the whole habitable globe is ransacked for whom the caravans of the east are continually in march and the remotest seas are covered with ships these pampered creatures sated with superfluity are often glad to inhabit an humble cot and to make an homely meal They run for refuge  into the arms of frugality Madmen that they are to live always in fear of what they sometimes wish for and to fly from that life which they find it luxury to imitate Let us cast our eyes backwards on those great men who lived in the ages of virtue of simplicity of frugality and let us blush to think that we enjoy in banishment more than they were masters of in the midst of their glory in the utmost affluence of their fortune Let us imagine that we behold a great dictator giving audience to the  Samnit  ambassadors and preparing on the hearth his mean repast with the same hand which had so often subdued the enemies of the commonwealth and borne the triumphal laurel to the Capitol Let us remember that  Plato  had but three servants and that  Zeno  had none  Socrates  the reformer of his country was maintained as  Menenius Agrippa  the arbiter of his country was buried by contribution While  Attilius Regulus  beat the  Carthaginians  in  Afric  the flight of his ploughman reduced his family to distress at home and the tillage of his little farm became the public care  Scipio  died without leaving enough to marry his daughters and their portions were paid out of the treasury of the state for sure it was just that the people of  Rome  should once pay tribute to him who had established a perpetual tribute on  Carthage  After such examples shall we be afraid of poverty shall we disdain to be adopted into a family which has so many illustrious ancestors shall we complain of banishment for  taking from us what the greatest philosophers and the greatest heroes of antiquity never enjoyed  IBID  RESIGNATION  THE darts of adverse fortune are always levelled at our heads Some reach us some graze against us and fly to wound our neighbours Let us therefore impose an equal temper on our minds and pay without murmuring the tribute which we owe to humanity The winter brings cold and we must freeze The summer returns with heat and we must melt The inclemency of the air disorders our health and we must be sick Here we are exposed to wild beasts and there to men more savage than the beasts and if we escape the inconveniencies and dangers of the air and the earth there are perils by water and perils by fire This established course of things it is not in our power to change but it is in our power to assume such a greatness of mind as becomeswise and virtuous men as may enable us to encounter the accidents of life with fortitude and to conform ourselves to the order of Nature who governs her great kingdom the world by continual mutations Let us submit to this order let us be persuaded that whatever does happen ought to happen and never be so foolish as to expostulate with Nature The best resolution we can take is to suffer what we cannot alter and to pursue without repining the  road which Providence who directs every thing has marked out to us for it is not enough to follow and he is but a bad soldier who sighs and marches on with reluctancy We must receive the orders with spirit and chearfulness and not endeavour to slink out of the post which is assigned us in this beautiful disposition of things whereof even our sufferings make a necessary part Let us address ourselves to God who governs all as  Cleanthes  did in those admirable verses which are going to lose part of their grace and energy in my translation of them  Parent of Nature Master of the World  Where'er thy Providence directs behold  My steps with chearful resignation turn  Fate leads the willing drags the backward on  Why should I grieve when grieving I must bear  Or take with guilt what guiltless I might share  Thus let us speak and thus let us act Resignation to the will of God is true magnanimity But the sure mark of a pusillanimous and base spirit is to struggle against to censure the order of Providence and instead of mending our own conduct to set up for correcting that of our Maker  END OF THE BEAUTIES OF BOLINGBROKE  SUPPLEMENT  TWO Essays one on  Suicide  and the other on the  Immortality of the Soul being handed about as the production of Mr HUME  in a compilation of this kind it was thought they could not with propriety be wholly overlooked We have reserved however our extracts from them to a Supplement as engrossing them in the body of the work would have given them a distinction for which they were not certainly originally meant These are accompanied with a few notes which we hope will prevent their making any bad impressions on the young the thoughtless or the ignorant  PHILOSOPHY THE ONLY REMEDY TO A MIND DISEASED  ONE considerable advantage that arises from philosophy consists in the sovereign antidote which it affords to superstition and false religion All other remedies against that pestilent distemper are vain or at least uncertain Plain good sense and the practice of the world which alone serve  most purposes of life are here found ineffectual history as well as daily experience furnish instances of men endowed with the strongest capacity for business and affairs who have all their lives crouched under slavery to the grossest superstition Even gaiety and sweetness of temper which infuse a balm into every other wound afford no remedy to so virulent a poison as we may particularly observe of the fair sex who though commonly possessed of these rich presents of nature feel many of their joys blasted by this importunate intruder But when sound Philosophy has once gained possession of the mind superstition is effectually excluded and one may fairly affirm that her triumph over this enemy is more complete than over most of the vices and imperfections incident to human nature Love or anger ambition or avarice have their root in the temper and affections which the soundest reason is scarce ever able fully to correct but superstition being founded on false opinion must immediately vanish when true philosophy has inspired juster sentiments of superior powers The contest is here more equal between the distemper and the medicine and nothing can hinder the latter from proving effectual but its being false and sophisticated  It will here be superfluous to magnify the merits of philosophy by displaying the pernicious tendency of that vice of which it cures the human  mind The superstitious man says  Tully  De Divin lib  ii  is miserable in every scene in every incident of life even sleep itself which banishes all other cares of unhappy mortals affords to him matter of new terror while he examines his dreams and finds in those visions of the night prognostications of future calamities I may add that though death alone can put a full period to his misery he dares not fly to this refuge but still prolongs a miserable existence from a vain fear left he offend his Maker by using the power with which that beneficent being has endowed him The presents of God and nature are ravished from us by this cruel enemy and notwithstanding that one step would remove us from the regions of pain and sorrow her menaces still chain us down to a hated being which she herself chiefly contributes to render miserable  The existence of all animals depends entirely on their attachment to self preservation It is by this principle alone that Nature has chiefly consulted her own safety Our author's notions are so hostile to her most essential institutions that she could not possibly survive a general conviction of them And the question here is Whether the wisdom of Nature or the philosophy of  H  deserve the preference  ESSAY ON SUICIDE  SUICIDE  A MAN who retires from life does no harm to society he only ceases to do good which if it is an injury is of the lowest kindAll our obligations to do good to society seem to imply something reciprocal I receive the benefits of society and therefore ought to promote its interests but when I withdraw myself altogether from society can I be bound any longer But allowing that our obligations to do good were perpetual they have certainly some bounds I am not obliged to do a small good to society at the expence of a great harm to myself Why then should I prolong a miserable existence because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me If upon account of age and infirmities I may lawfully resign any office and employ my time altogether in fencing against these calamities and alleviating as much as possible the miseries of my future life why may I not cut short these miseries at once by an action which is no more prejudicial to society But suppose that it is no longer in my power to promote the interest of society suppose that I am a burthen to it suppose that my life hinders some person from being much more useful to society in such cases my resignation of life must not only be innocent but laudable and most people who lie under any temptation to abandon existence are in some such  situation those who have health or power or authority have commonly better reason to be in humour with the world  On this extravagant hypothesis the authority of creation and dissolution is made reciprocal The man who assumes the liberty of destroying himself were he possessed of the power might also be his own creator his imaginary insignificance to society being as inclusive in the one case as any chimerical advantage to it that may accidentally strike him can be in the other  IBID  OUR NATURAL ANTIPATHY TO DEATH  I BELIEVE that no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping for such is our natural horror of death that sinall motives will never be able to reconcile us to it and though perhaps the situation of a man's health or fortune did not seem to require this remedy we may at least be assured that any one who without apparent reason has had recourse to it was cursed with such an incurable depravity or gloominess of temper as must poison all enjoyment and render him equally miserable as if he had been loaded with the most grievous misfortunes  IBID  THE HUMAN FACULTIES ADEQUATE TO THE DUTIES OF LIFE  OBSERVE with what exact proportion the task to be performed and the performing powers are adjusted throughout all nature If the reason of man gives him a great superiority above other animals his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him his whole time his whole capacity activity courage passion find sufficient employment in fencing against the miseries of his present condition and frequently nay almost always are too slender for the business assigned themA pair of shoes perhaps was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection which that commodity is capable of attaining yet it is necessary at least very useful that there should be some politicians and moralists even some geometers poets and philosophers among mankind The powers of men are no more superior to their wants considered merely in this life than those of foxes and hares are compared to  their  wants and to their period of existence  ESSAY ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL  THE COURSE OF NATURE  THE last symptoms which the mind discovers are disorder weakness insensibility stupidity the forerunners of its annihilation The farther progress  of the same causes increasing the same effects totally extinguish it Judging by the usual analogy of nature no form can continue when transferred to a condition of life very different from the original one in which it was placed Trees perish in the water fishes in the air animals in the earth Even so small a difference as that of climate is often fatal What reason then to imagine that an immense alteration such as is made on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of thought and sensation can be effected without the dissolution of the whole Every thing is in common betwixt soul and body the organs of the one are all of them the organs of the other The existence therefore of the one must be dependent on that of the other The souls of animals are allowed to be mortal and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men that the analogy from one to the other forms a very strong argument  The author's own last moments gave the lye to the first part of this paragraph His reasoning against the  existence in a separate state is defective and inconclusive because the instances he urges are in every respect dissimilar Neither is it yet a settled point among Christians whether the souls of mere animals are mortal or immortal  IBID  FUTURE RESIDENCE  HOW to dispose of the infinite number of posthumous existences ought also to embarrass the religious theory Every planet in every solar system we are at liberty to imagine peopled with intelligent mortal beings at least we can fix on no other supposition For these then a new universe must every generation be created beyond the bounds of the present universe or one must have been created at first so prodigiously wide as to admit of this continual influx of beings  This strange and romantic conception supposes locality and space essential though in ftat contradiction to all our ideas of spiritual existence  IBID  FINIS  BOOKS lately published by G KEARSLEY near  Serjeant'sInn
