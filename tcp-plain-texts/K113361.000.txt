PEERAGE of SCOTLAND under your Lordship's Protection and to subscribe myself  MY LORD  Your Lordship's most obliged most devoted and most obedient Servant ROBERT DOUGLAS  PREFACE  THE Necessity of publishing a new PEERAGE of SCOTLAND and the Utility of it is acknowledged by all The Compiler of this present Work has attempted it upon a more regular and accurate Plan than has hitherto appeared How far he has succeeded the World must judge But if the most assiduous Application for many Years if a painful Enquiry into the public Records and ancient Chartularies if an unwearied Search after every Degree of Knowledge necessary for carrying on so arduous a Task if these have any Merit or deserve the Favour of the Public the Author flatters himself this Work on Perusal will not be found deficient Neither has he relied solely upon his own Skill He acknowledges with the utmost Gratitude the Obligations he lies under to  Walter MacFarlane  Esq of that Ilk for the generous and benevolent Communication of that Treasury of  Scotch  Antiquities of which he is possessed Nor have the Keepers of the public Archives been wanting in contributing all in their Power to forward the Design  BUT notwithstanding all that has been done there doubtless may and will be Mistakes such are unavoidable in a Work of this Kind though the Author hopes they will not be found numerous as all Manner of Pains has been taken to avoid them as well by the Labour bestowed upon the Compilation as by putting it in the Power of every Peer to correct or add to the History of his own Family by sending him a Manuscript Copy some Time before Publication they producing sufficient Documents in Support of any Alteration made And where the History of any particular Family in this Work varies either from former Authors or from received Family Opinions Care has been taken to justify the Difference of Sentiment by undoubted Authorities quoted on the Margin  ANY  Inaccuracies that may be in Point of Language 'tis hoped the Reader will overlook  It must be owned that has not been so much attended to The chief and principal Point the Author had in View and the great Object of his Attention being in a plain and distinct Manner to deduce the History of each Family from its Origin to the present Generation and to ascertain their Genealogy and Chronology by undisputed Documents This 'tis hoped is done and nothing further is pretended Such Escapes or Omissions as have been discovered in particular Families since they were printed off are carefully inserted in the Addenda at the End of the PEERAGE  IT will probably be observed by our Readers that certain Chartularies and other Vouchers quoted on the Margin are said to be  penes MacFarlane  though the Originals are actually in the Possession of others but as that great and ingenious  Antiquary in his valuable Collection has authenticated Copies of all these Documents the Author was obliged to quote those Copies when he had not Access to the Originals  'Tis thought proper here also to inform our Readers that in engraving the Arms of the Nobility as prefixed to this Work the Order is followed in which they are ranked in the Roll made up at the Union Parliament in and which has been looked on as an authentic Roll ever since  IT is acknowledged that according to our printed Proposals there should have been added a short System of Heraldry  c  but as this Volume has swelled to a much greater Bulk than was expected that Treatise must be reserved for the second Part of this Work the BARONAGE or an Account of the GENTRY of  Scotland  and as there are few Peers but have some Descendents who will appear in the BARONAGE there will then be a proper Opportunity of publishing any remarkable Event that has been omitted here  THE Addenda or Alterations since this Work has been put to the Press the Author has thrown at the End of this Volume and for the greater Ease to the Reader has reduced them to alphabetical Order by which Means any Thing wanted may easily be found out  THE Reader is desired to excuse some seeming Inaccuracies that appear in numbering the Pages of this Work These were occasioned by the Additions made to several Families since they were first printed off whereby the Numbers of many Pages are doubled  SUBSCRIBERS  A  His Grace Archibald Duke of Argyle  large paper  His Grace James Duke of Athole two Copies  l

explanation part whereof was in these words  "I take it in so far as it is consistent with itself and the protestant religion and I do declare I mean not to bind up myself in my station but in a lawful way to endeavour any thing I think for the advantage of the church or state not repugnant to the protestant religion and my loyalty and this I understand as a part of my oath"  Crawfurd's

the religion and liberties of the kingdom he thought it not only just but his duty to God and his country to oppose his tyrannical usurpation and invited all true protestants to join him"  The earl's little army being defeated and dispersed  Scotch comp p  and himself taken prisoner he was again sent to the castle of Edinburgh and soon thereafter beheaded at the mercatcross in consequence of his

Hamhouse in England in June and was educated at the university of Glasgow He afterwards applied himself to the study of the law at Utrecht but upon his father's being created a duke he laid aside the scheme of appearing at the bar and betook himself to a military life served under the great duke of Marlborough was colonel of the thirtysixth regiment of foot and governor of Dambarton castle But his genius pointing more strongly to the statesman than the soldier he did not continue long in the army but applied himself chiefly to that study which made the after part of his life so shining and conspicuous  In he was made treasurer of Scotland and took his seat in the parliament where he made so great a figure that in he was nominated one of the commissioners for the treaty of union and got a patent creating him earl and viscount Islay lord Oronsay Dunoon and Arrois  c  In he was made an extraordinary lord of session was elected one of the sixteen peers for the first British parliament and was chosen member to every future session excepting that called to meet in November  In he was made justicegeneral of Scotland and in he was called to the privy council  In upon the accession of

hereditary great master of the houshold hereditary keeper of Dunstaffnage Carrick and several other castles  He was a man of great natural and acquired endowments quick penetrating and thoroughly versant in the knowledge of mankind of an accurate and distinct elocution and a ready judgment His thorough knowledge of the laws of his country qualified him to shine in the great council of the nation and in the cabinet of his sovereign His great sagacity and uncommon abilities pointed him out as a proper person for the chief management of all Scotch affairs and the propriety of the choice will appear from his attention to promote trade and manufactures to encourage learning and learned men and forward every improvement for the good of his country  During his administration the manufacture of linen cloth was raised to an uncommon pitch both in quality and quantity The universities received distinguishing marks of his favour by establishing new professions and in every shape promoting their good particularly he encouraged the profession of physic in the university of Edinburgh which is now a school for that science famous all over Europe  He procured from his late majesty king George II for the infirmary of Edinburgh the invalid money to the extent of about l a sum that enabled the managers of that hospital to enlarge their plan considerably the utility of which is daily felt by the numbers of poor patients both civil and military who find relief from this charity  After in order to destroy the seeds of future rebellions he advised his majesty to employ the highlanders in the army a proposal worthy of the patriot who contrived it magnanimous in the king who approved it and most honourable to themselves who executed it for it must be owned that to this wise counsel 'tis in some measure owing that Cape Breton Canada  c c  are now under the government of this kingdom as the courage and intrepidity of these brave and heroic men wherever they were called doubtless contributed greatly to the conquests  Such was Archib  d in a public sphere nor was he less distinguished in private life His eminent learning and strong natural talents contributed to make him pass his hours of recess from business agreeably to himself and for the instruction and good of others He was qualified for every subject of conversation with the greatest philosopher or the meanest and most ingenious mechanic For the amusement of the closet he collected the most valuable private library in Great Britain where he unbent his mind from the cares of ministerial affairs and added to the immense stock of knowledge he had already acquired  The noble and magnificent palace which  he has built at Inverara will stand a lasting monument of the regard he had for his family who before had no house suitable to their dignity  This great man enjoyed all the faculties of his mind found and entire till his death which happened very suddenly on the th day of April in the th year of his age and was according to his own orders buried at Kilmun in the parish of Dunoon in Argyleshire the buryingplace of the family And having no issue his estate and honours devolved upon his

of Restalrig evidently disproves a story which has long prevailed with many that Logan was forfeited by the king after he was dead for the immediate purpose of bestowing his lands on his favourite secretary Balmerino Logan was not forfeited till the th June 'Tis plain from the above charter that Balmerino purchased these lands at least four years before and it may be further observed that tho'

queen's time was captain of a company of foot  In he engaged in the rebellion and after the battle of Culloden was taken prisoner carried to London tried before the house of lords found guilty of high treason condemned and beheaded on Towerhill the th of August in the fiftyeight year of his age where he behaved with uncommon constancy and resolution  As this lord's behaviour was magnanimous and great during his confinement and at his execution we shall take the liberty here to insert a few passages from a paper published by the authority of the sheriff of London after his death  A little before he was carried to Towerhill he demanded an interview with lord Kilmarnock who was in the same unhappy situation with himself which was granted After it was ended the two lords saluted one another and Balmerino  "bid lord Kilmarnock an eternal happy adieu and with a chearful countenance added My dear lord I wish I could alone pay the reckoning and suffer for us both  c  "  During the time the scaffold was putting in order for the execution of lord Balmerino the sheriff that attended at the first execution went to Balmerino's apartments as a notice to his lordship that his time was come upon whose entrance his lordship said  "I suppose lord Kilmarnock is no more"  and having asked how the executioner performed his duty upon receiving the account said  "Then it was well done and now gentlemen said his lordship I will detain you no longer for I desire not to protract my life"  He then saluted the company in a manner so chearful as drew tears from every eye but his own and hastened to the scaffold  But before we view his lordship on the scaffold 'tis but just to the memory of that great but unhappy man to acquaint the public what was his deportment in his retirement here 'Twas graceful without affectation chearful but not presumptuous He conversed freely with his friends twice refreshed himself with a bit of bread and a glass of wine and desired the company to drink to him  Ain degrae ta haiven  but above all he called frequently upon God and seemed both willing and prepared to die  When he mounted the scaffold he did it with so undaunted a step as surprised every spectator that was unacquainted with the greatness of his soul  He walked round the scaffold bowed to the people read the following inscription on his coffin  Arthurus dominus de Balmerino decollatus    die Augusti    aetatis suae  said it was right and with seeming pleasure looked on the block which he called his pillow of rest  He then called for the executioner who being introduced to him was about to ask his forgiveness but my lord stopt him and said  "Friend you need not ask me forgiveness the execution of your duty is commendable"  then presenting the executioner with three guineas said  "Friend I never had much money this is all I have I wish it was more for your sake and am sorry I can add nothing else to it but my coat and waistcoat"  which he instantly took off and placed on his coffin for the executioner Having prepared himself for the block he took his last farewel of them and having once more taken a view of the great number of spectators his lordship said  "I am afraid there are some who may think my behaviour bold"  and speaking to a gentleman near him added  "Remember sir what I tell you it arises from a confidence in God and a clear conscience"  Then observing the executioner with the ax in his hand took it from him and having felt the edge return'd it him again at the same time showing him where to strike the blow and animating him to do it with resolution  "For in that friend said he will consist your mercy"  His lordship then with the same surprising countenance kneeled down at the block and having with his arms extended said this short prayer  "O Lord reward my friends forgive my enemies and receive my soul"  submitted and gave the signal to the executioner  He married a daughter of Capt Chalmers by whom he had no

of the most remarkable particulars  He was born at Rotterdam in and was bred chiefly at Paris under the eye of the queenmother He had a fine person and a most graceful behaviour and was a great favourite of his father who not only bestowed on him many great and lucrative posts but was instrumental in procuring him the above marriage which at that time was one of the greatest in the kingdom  He came to England in was created baron of Tyndale earl of Doncaster duke of Monmouth and knight of the garter in and the next session of parliament he took his seat in the house of peers  In he was made captain of the the king's life guards of horse captaingeneral  of the king's forces and had many other instances of the royal bounty and favour His brave and gallant behaviour in the wars abroad gained him the reputation of an able general  In there happened an insurrection in Scotland after the murder of archbishop Sharp which was raised by the presbyterians in hopes of overturning episcopacy The duke had the command of the king's troops and fought and defeated the rebels at Bothwellbridge which put an end to that rebellion  He afterwards became very popular especially with the discontented party and those who were against the duke of York's succession to the crown who thought of nothing less than making the duke of Monmouth king and though the duke had been guilty of some very suspicious practices yet upon his submission the king was pleased to pardon him  Sometime thereafter being again banished the court he retired to Holland where he stayed till the king's death in  In May being persuaded to attempt the crown he invaded the country from Holland with seven or eight hundred officers and men landed at Lyme in Dorsetshire and emitted a manifesto or declaration seting forth  "That he came in defence of the protestant religion the laws rights and privileges of England and invited all people to join him  c  "  The king being informed of all these proceedings acquainted his parliament whereupon both houses voted an address of thanks to his majesty and the commons ordered in a bill to attaint the duke of high treason which passed accordingly  In the mean time great numbers of people flocked into his army from all hands and at Bridgewater and other places he was proclaimed king  The earl of Feversham commanded the king's troops which were then encamped

Scotch camp King Kenneth being highly provoked and incensed at the affront offered a considerable reward to any of his subjects who would take down and carry off the corpse but for some time none would venture to undertake the dangerous enterprise At last a gentleman of more spirit and courage than the rest said  dal zell  which in the old Scotch language signifies  I dare  He effectually performed it to the king's satisfaction who accordingly rewarded him nobly His posterity assumed the word DALZELL for their sirname and that remarkable bearing of a man hanging on a gallows for their

the royal family  by him of the great king Robert Bruce as will be shown in the following title  BRUCE Lord of ANNANDALE and Earl of CARRICK  HAD the name of BRUCE been distinguished by no other person but the great and immortal king Robert he alone is sufficient not only to ennoble a name but a nation but to his glory and renown we have that of other kings and other heroes to be added to raise this family to the highest pitch of grandeur amongst the illustrious houses of the Scotch nobility  We shall therefore deduce their descent from the Norman conquest of England which we presume was their first settlement in this island  Amongst the great number of noble and valiant Normans that came over to England with William the Conqueror  anno  none made a greater figure than Robert de Bruce the undoubted ancestor of this family  I ROBERT BRUIS  Nobilis miles de Normand Monasticon Anglicnum v II p in bibl jurid Edin  or Bruce whom sir William Dugdale calls a noble knight of Normandy seems to have had no small share in the conquest of England  And as William divided the conquered lands amongst those of his followers who had most remarkably distinguished themselves for conduct and bravery so none appears to have got so large a share as this Robert de Bruis for both Scotch and English historians agree that he got possession of the castle and manor of Skelton  Abercrombie's hist Dugdales baronage Mon anglic where most of his lands are particularly mentioned  which became the chief title of his family with above ninety lordships in the east west and north Ridings of Yorkshire whereof Gysburn in Cleveland which we shall have occasion often to mention hereafter was one  This Robert died about the year some say  anno  and left issue a son and successor  II ROBET de BRUIS second lord of Skelton a man of great worth and honour who having contracted a friendship with king David I while he resided in England and his lady being then dead by whom he had a son and heir he came to Scotland with David who was a generous prince and always conferred his favours upon persons of merit  We shall observe that during the reign of king Alexander I his brother David was designed  comes  and prince of Cumberland and was superior of the whole lordship of Annandale He was also earl of Northumberland Huntington  Sir Ja Dalrymple's col p and  and Northampton in right of his wife Mathilda which is fully documented from the register of the episcopal see of Glasgow  That Robert de Bruis came to Scotland with David and was accounted one of his nobles or vassals is clear from the said register of Glasgow where  comes  David gives  centum solidorum in  Hardingestra in Northamptonshire for repairing the church of Glasgow The original writ bears  "with consent of Mathilda his wife  et procerum et militum meorum Roberti de Brus  Sir William Dugdales bar tom II p Sir Ja Dalrymple's collections  c inter ann  and "  This alone is sufficient proof of Robert's being in Scotland with David It is no less certain  Register of the church of Glasgow cir  iter ann  that he got possession of the lordship of Annandale of which there are many documents and it is affirmed by some historians that king David procured him in maririage Agnes Annand heiress to the rich lordship of Annandale which contained all the lands from the bounds of Dunegal and Strathnith to the lands of Ranulph de Meschines then earl of Chester and lord of Cumberland which king David confirmed to him whereby he came to have large possessions both in Scotland and in England  And being a man of great parts and equally qualified for the cabinet and the field was long in high favour both with king David I of Scotland and king Henry I of England  In the year Robert being at the court of England king Stephen joined him in commission with Bernard de Baliol to endeavour to dissuade or divert king David of Scotland from his intended invasion of England for which Robert used all his interest but David either neglecting or despising the advice  Sir Ja Dalrymple and Sir William Dugdale  pursued his former resolutions and entered England with a considerable army Upon which Robert withdrew his allegiance from David for his lands he held of him in Scotland and was on the English side at the battle of Standard  anno    Monasticon Angli vol II p  where he took prisoner his own son Robert whom he had left in Scotland  Nutrici suae custodiendum emendavit c  and was then about years of age When his father presented him to the king of England he desired him to deliver him to his nurse to be taken care of  Tom II p  c  Sir William Dugdale says he was more sit to be eating wheat bread with his mother than by force of arms to be defending his patrimony of Annandale  c  However the year thereafter a peace was concluded upon very honourable terms for Scotland Northumberland having been delivered up to prince Henry and Robert continued in friendship and favour with king David ever after  He was very liberal in his donations to the religious  Monast Angl Charta fundationis prioratus de Gysburn  having in th of Henry I  anno    pro salute animae suae c  ounded the monastery of canons regular at Gysburn in honour of the blessed virgin which he endowed with twenty carucates of land a carucate being then sixty acres  He gave also to the same monastery the patronage of all the

the pertinents  c  By her he had issue a son  Adam de Bruce  He married dly Agnes Annand by whom he got the lordship of Annandale in Scotland as before noticed and by her had issue two sons    William

his posterity  This Robert  Monasticon Anglicanum p  second lord of Skelton in England and first lord of Annandale in Scotland according to sir William Dugdale died  anno    Ibid p Et sepultus est

Skelton in England are descended of Adam eldest son of the above Robert we shall briefly deduce the genealogy of that family from  Monasticon Anglicanum  till their male line failed  III ADAM de BRUCE

estate was divided amongst his four sisters  Monast Angl  who were all married and of whom several of the most considerable families in England are descended  The male line of Adam de Bruce eldest son of Robert second lord of Skelton and first of Annandale thus ending about the year the representation of that illustrious family fell to Robert earl of Carrick afterwards king Robert Bruce who was the undoubted heir male being lineally descended of the second son of the said second Robert to whom we now return  III WILLIAM de BRUCE second son of Robert second lord of Skelton succeeded to the lordship of Annandale in Scotland in right of his mother  anno  and to the lands of Harle Hartness and Cleveland in England by his father's gift to be held of him and his successors lords of Skelton

Edward  anno    After the death of queen Margaret daughter of the king of Norway grandchild and undoubted heiress of king Alexander III this Robert claimed the crown in right of his mother  It was alledged among many other arguments in his behalf that it was customary in Scotland for the brother of the last king to be preferred before his son and produced for an example that Donald  Ibidem Abercrombie c  brother of Kenneth Macalpine attained the crown preferable to Constantine his brother Kenneth's son  That king Alexander II failing heirs of his own body looked upon Robert Bruce as his heir even to the knowledge of Dornagild his mother's elder sister who was then alive and assented to it at least did not contradict it having no male issue of her own  And that it was a constant maxim in Scotland  Rymer tom II p c c  for the son of the second daughter to be preferred to the heir female of the eldest daughter  Prynne's coll vol III p  And further that king Alexander III acknowledged this Robert to be next heir to the crown failing heirs of his own body all which he offered to prove by living witnesses  But as that subject has been largely handled by several able historians 'tis needless to insist further on it here since it is well known how king Edward of England determined the controversy  Robert the competitor married Isabel de Clare daughter of Gilbert de Clare earl of Glocester and Hartfield by whom he had three sons and one daughter    Robert de Bruce  Sir  Bernard Bruce  who got from his father the lands of Connington in Huntingtonshire  Sir William Dugdale's

daughter  Christian  married to Patrick Dunbar earl of March one of the competitors for the crown  As Robert Bruce thought that John Baliol in the competition for the crown was unjustly preferred to him so he could never be prevailed upon  Baronage of England Chron Walteri abbatis de Gysburn  either to give up his title or to acknowledge king Edward to be superior or John Baliol to be king of Scotland but in great discontent retired to England where he did not remain long but returned to his castle of Lochmaben where he died and was buried with his ancestors in the abbay of Gysburn  anno    He was succeeded by his eldest son  VII ROBERT de BRUCE sixth lord of  Annandale afterwards earl of Carrick who in his younger years together with Adam de Kilconath in right of his wife earl of Carrick accompanied Edward prince of England  He died in by the chron of Melross and in by Sir William Dugdale  and king Lewis I of France to the holy war where by his courage and conduct he gained immortal honour and where the earl of Carrick died  anno  as before noticed  Robert after his return retired to England where he had a considerable estate and though he never would submit to or acknowledge John Baliol to be king of Scotland he continued in the English interest for some time and with his son Robert afterwards king of Scotland contributed greatly to the English gaining the battle of Dunbar against the loyalists  anno    He married Margaret countess of Carrick daughter and sole heiress of Neil earl of Carrick and widow of the foresaid Adam de Kilconath  Chronicle of

following year he determined to assert his just title to the crown was joined by the loyalists or patriots and crowned at Scoon on palmsunday the th of March  Soon thereafter he relieved and entirely redeemed his distressed country from the usurpations and tyranny of a foreign power but as the great actions of this hero are fully set forth and recorded by many able historians and do not properly fall within the plan of this work we shall only add that no age or country ever produced a man of more eminent qualities  Abercrombie and all other Scotch historians  either for peace or war than the

French with very good success but at the fatal battle of Durham he was wounded and taken prisoner  anno    He was detained long in England though many treaties were set on foot by his faithful and

whereby the earldom of Carrick fell to the crown  And as that title was never after conferred upon any but the sons of our kings till king Charles I bestowed it upon James lord Kincleven we shall

Scotland by the name of king Robert III  II DAVID prince of Scotland and duke of Rothsay eldest son of king Robert III was created earl of Carrick by his father but died before him without issue  III

progenitors of this noble and illustrious family were considerable proprietors and had large possessions in the west of Scotland particularly in Carrick before sirnames were much used in this country  That a family of rank and figure in Carrick were the undoubted ancestors of the KENNEDIES of Cassilis and that they assumed their sirname from their being head or chief of that family is sufficiently instructed by the following connexion of authentic documents and charters from father to son so that these historians who alledge that the first of this family came from Ireland must have been in a mistake  I DUNCANUS de Carrick flourished in the reign of Malcolm IV who succeeded to the crown of Scotland  anno  Being possessed of a considerable estate in Carrick he and his posterity were for some time designed by that name  He left issue a son and successor  II NICHOLAUS de Carrick who made a donation to the nuns of Northberwick of the patronage of the church of St Cuthbert at Maybole in

He was succeeded by his son  III ROLANDUS de Carrick who in the reign of king Alexander II obtained a charter from Nigellus earl of Carrick of the bailiary of Carrick to be  caput totius prosapiae

III the th year of his reign  anno  in which he is designed  Rolandus de Carrick  Ibidem  filius Nicolai filii Duncani c  All which is fully narrated and confirmed by king Robert II  Chart in pub archiv  anno regni secundo  This family being evidently possessed of a large estate and head of a considerable tribe or clan began to be called Kennadies from the  Galic  or  Celtic  word Keannaty which signifies head of the house or chief of the clan and in that country the word Kennady is called Kennaty to this day  There are several charters in the records wherein the same persons are designed Carrick in the body and Kennady on the margin in the reign of king Robert II  Ibidem  by which it is certain that Carrick and Kennady wete promiscuously used by the heads of this family for a considerable time though their cadets generally took the name of Kennady  Roland was succeeded by his son  IV Sir GILBERT de CARRICK who in several authentic writs is designed son of Roland particularly in a submission of a difference betwixt him and the nuns of Northberwick in which Robert Bruce earl of Carrick father of king Robert Bruce and Robert bishop of Glasgow were arbiters He is therein designed  Gilbertus de Carrick miles filius Rolandi c  and his seal which is thereto appended hath the very same shield of arms which the family of Cassilis carries at this day which shows that they had the double tressure sloree  Nisbet's append et cart in pub arch  and contraflorce with flower de lisses to their arms long before they matched with the royal family  This sir Gilbert was often designed Kennady and had lands in his possession of the same designation which appears by the following charter of confirmation from the earl of Lennox to his son  V Sir GILBERT de CARRICK or Kennady who succeeded him There is a charter of Malcolm earl of Lennox  Chartul of Levenax penes MacFarlane p  c facta Gilberto de Carrick filio et haeredi domini Gilberti de Carrick militis de terris

DUNCAN de CARRICK or Kennady who made a donation of his patronage of the church of Kilbryde in Carrick to the nuns of Northberwick  Nisbet's app  nd p  wherein he is designed  Duncanus filius domini Gilberti de Carrick militis c  As he had begun to drop the name of Carrick and was more frequently designed by the name of Kennedy as  caput totius prosapiae  so the cadets of the family who were now become numerous followed his example laid aside the name of Carrick altogether and embraced that of Kennedy of which there are many examples in our records but whether any of them were brothers or sons of this Duncan I cannot determine  viz  Alexander Kennedy was chancellor to John Baliol  Remarks on Ragman's roll p  anno    John Kennedy swore fealty to king Edward I  Prynne's collections vol

THE sirname of Crawfurd is of great antiquity in the west of Scotland is certainly local and was assumed by the proprietors of the lands and barony of Crawfurd in Clydsdale as soon as sirnames began to be used in this country  The immediate ancestor of this family was  I GALFRIDUS de CRAWFURD a man of rank and distinction in the reigns of king Malcolm IV and king William the Lyon who succeeded Malcolm  anno    This Galfride  Sir Ja Dalrymple's coll and Chartul o  Kelso pe+nes MacFarlane  was witness to a charter of Roger bishop of St Andrews concerning the freedom and independency of the

died  There flourished about this time Gualterus de Crawfurd who is likewise mentioned in a charter of Roger bishop of St Andrews  Ibid p  ante  Whether he was brother to Galfride or of another family

 a fess  ermine  LINDSAY Earl of CRAWFURD  THE noble and illustrious name of Lindsay is of very great antiquity in Scotland but there are many different accounts of their origin  Some say that a man of considerable rank and courage who gave great assistance to king Kenneth II in his wars against the Picts about the year was the first of the sirname of Lindsay in this country  Sir William Dugdale in his baronage mentions several considerable families of the name of Lindsay in England in the eleventh and twelfth centuries that their sirname was local and was first assumed by the proprietors of the lands and manor of Lindsai in the county of Essex  Our best antiquaries therefore are of opinion that one of these Lindsays  Lesly Boethius Aber  rombie c  having contracted a friendship with king Malcolm Canmore when in England came with him to Scotland where he settled and had several lands bestowed upon him by that generous prince particularly the lands of Wachopdale  c  and that he was progenitor of the Lindsays in Scotland Certain it is they began to make a figure in this country in the reign of king Alexander I  Ib Fordun  who was son of king Malcolm Canmore succeeded to the crown  anno  and died  anno  and in the reigns of king William the Lion and king Alexander II there were a number of patriots and great men of that sirname in Scotland which is attested by all Scotch historians  There flourished in the reign of king David I  Sir Ja Dalrymple's historical col p c  two brothers Willielmus and Walterus de Lindsay but which of them was the eldest we shall not pretend to determine  I WILLIELMUS de LINDSAY was the undoubted progenitor of this noble family and is documented by many authentic writs He appears to have been much about the court of king David I who succeeded to the crown  anno  and died  anno    He was witness to most of the charters and donations made by that good prince to the religious and also to those of his son Henry Prince of Scotland  In

mentioned in many other charters and donations of king David but 'tis needless to insert them here  He left issue two sons  Sir  William  his heir    Robert  de  Lindsay  who got from his father the lands of Locherwood or Locharret which appears from a donation made by this Robert to the monks of Newbottle  Ibid p ▪  of the peatmoss of Locharret called Ulnishtrochar  quam pater suus illis dedit c

uro  CHIEF SEATS  At CastleLeod and NewTarbat in Rossshire  RAMSAY Parl of DALHOTSIE  ANTIQUARIES do not exactly agree about the origin of the illustrious name of Ramsay  Some are of opinion that it came originally from Germany the armorial bearing being an eagle displayed  Others with more probability say from England that it is local and was first assumed from the lands and abbacy of Ramsay in Nottinghameshire  c  Certain it is the Ramsays were settled in this country as early as the reign of king David I who succeeded to the crown of Scotland  anno  And it appears from Rymer's foedaera Angliae and Prynne's collections that there were many considerable families in Scotland of that sirname long before the reign of king Robert Bruce  It is evident also from our histories and records that besides the Ramsays in MidLothian there were many eminent families of that sirname in Fife Angus and Perthshire in very early times  viz  the Ramsays of Coluthie Carnock Corston Forthar Parbroath Auchterhouse Balmain Banff and many others some whereof have been hereditary sheriffs of Angus sheriffs of Fife Edinburgh  c  and have enjoyed the highest offices in the state but whether they are all descended from the Ramsays of Dalhousie who are certainly the head or chief of the Ramsays in Midlothian we shall not pretend to determine but shall proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents from  I SIMON de RAMSAY  Char in pub arch  who flourished in the reign of king David I and Malcom IV and is witness in a grant of the church of Livingston  in WestLothian by

DENNISTON  THE sirname of Denniston is of very great antiquity in the west of Scotland and is said to have been first assumed by one Daniel who when sirnames began to be used in this country called his lands and possessions Daniel'stown after his own christian name  which  Nisbet and Crawfurd  in process of time came to be corrupted into Denniston and it is certain that they were for a considerable time promis  uously called Danielsttoun and Denniston  In a charter of the barony of Houston  Dalrymple's appendix p  in the reign of king Malcolm IV he is said to be bounded by the lands of Daniel  c  which by the situation clearly appears to be the lands afterwards called Denniston  But the sirname of Denniston was certainly used before the reign of Malcolm IV  Chartul of Paisly p

William earl of Salisbury and both had children  But the earl dying without maleissue the honours became extinct  DOUGLAS Duke of DOUGLAS  IF a long train of illustrious ancestors distinguished by the highest titles and connected with the most august and noble families in Europe can make any name remarkable and great there is no subject can plead a higher claim than the Douglas but it is the least part of the glory of this family that it has been honoured with alliances by marriage into the first rank of nobility in Scotland England and France even with crowned heads having matched eleven times with the royal house of Scotland and once with that of England  That besides the honours conferred on them by their own sovereigns they have been dukes of Turenne counts of Longueville and marishals of France they were more distinguished by their virtue and merit than by their titles and opulency and the lustre of their actions outshone the splendour of their birth  Hence we see them leading the van of our armies in Scotland supporting by their valour the kingdom and crown of France tottering on the head of Charles VII when reduced to the last extremity by the bravery of the English raising the siege of Dantzick for which they had the highest honours conferred upon them conquering the Saracens in Spain with many other acts of military glory that have made this family renowned through all the corners of Europe for which we must refer to our historians as our business is more properly genealogy than biography  The traditional account of the origin of this noble family transmitted to us by historians is  About the year of God in the reign of Solvathius king of the Scots one Donald Bane of the western isles having invaded the Scotch territories and routed the royal army a man of rank and figure came seasonably with his friends and followers to the king's assistance he renewed the battle and obtained a compleat victory over the invader The king being desirous to see the man who had done him so signal a piece of service  he was pointed out to him by his colour or complexion in these words of the old Galic or Celtic language SHOLTO DUGLASH in English  Behold that black or swarthy coloured man  from which he was named Sholto the Douglas  The king royally rewarded his great services and gave him a grant of several lands and large possessions in the county of Lanark which were called Douglas and from hence came the sirname of the family  This Sholto is said to have left issue two sons    Hugh  ancestor of the Douglases in Scotland    William  progenitor of the Scoti Duglassii in Italy  As the illustrious and numerous family of the Scoti in Italy  Umbertus Locatus Franc San  c  are acknowledged by Italian historians as well as our own to be descended of the Douglases we shall therefore take the liberty here to give a short account of them from the best authorities  Achaius  Abercrombie vol I p Lib Ferdun Ib II cap  king of the Scots entered into a league with Charlemagne king of France about the year which subsisted inviolate betwixt the two crowns above years In consequence of this league Achaius sent his brother William with auxiliaries to the emperor who was marching an army into Italy to the pope's assistance against Desiderius king of the Lombards who had invaded the ecclesiastical territories  William Douglas second son of the said Sholto accompanied him in this expedition and being one of his chief commanders had a large share of the glory acquired by the Scots in that enterprize  After the war was ended William de Douglas being indisposed was left behind at Placentia when the auxliaries went home and being recovered he married the daughter of Antonio Spetino one of the most honourable families in that country He settled there and from him all that great and numerous family of the Scoti Duglassii are descended who have always carried the same armorial bearings with the Douglases in Scotland  Sir George MacK  nzie Nisbet's heraldry c  viz▪ argent  on a chief  azure  two or three stars of the field  An Italian historian says  Quando Carolo Magno sece l' impresa in Italia contra Desiderio Re de Longobardi  Franciscus Sansovinus de prima origine delle ease illustri d' Italia lib I  hebbe per suo condutiere di huomini di armi un Guillielmo Scozzese della familia de conti de Duglasi c  which sufficiently shows that the Scoti in Italy acknowledge their descent from the Douglases  And as there was a full account of these Scoti transmitted by Marc Antonio Scoto count de Agusano to William marquis of Douglas with their descent from the above period an exact copy whereof together with the large genealogical tree of the Douglases in Scotland finely done and beautifully illuminate is in possession of sir William Douglas of Glenbervy to that we refer and return to the Douglases in Scotland  And as we cannot from certain documents connect their descent till about three hundred years after Sholto we shall pass over the traditional account and deduce their genealogy where we have vouchers from history or records  I WILLIAM de DOUGLAS said to be lineally descended from the above Sholto was created lord or  dominus de  Douglas by king Malcolm Canmore at a  conventus procerum  held in Forfar according to John Major and Buchanan in but according to Boethius  anno    He lived after the year  Hume s

doubtless they were guilty for a good author says  "That while the Douglases were in England  Abercombie's martial atchievements vol II p  at least absent from court a parliament met at Edinburgh to which the earl of Douglas his mother and brothers were summoned in order to answer to such crimes as should be laid to their charge They refused to obey upon which they were declared rebels and their

discretion of the soldiers  c  "  It is most certain that the earl immediately upon his return to Scotland commenced a new rebellion and began to raise forces against the king He soon found himself again at the head of an army superior in number to his majesty's He went in quest of the royal troops and overtook them near Abercorn where the two armies encamped in sight of one another but it seems the seeds of loyalty still took place in the earl's breast or he was unwilling to spill the blood of his fellowsubjects for certain it is he declined fighting at least was not so forward to engage the royal army as was expected on so favourable an opportunity on which account lord Hamilton and some of the chiefs of his followers not only openly upbraided him but that very night deserted him went

gave him his life  He retired to the abbacy of Lindores where he became a religious and sincere penitent and continued a most faithful and loyal subject as long as he lived When the malcontents took

DUNDEE  ALL our antiquaries agree that one sir Alexander Carron a brave and valiant knight was the first who enjoyed the sirname of Scrymgeour in Scotland but our historians differ a little about the aera in which he lived Buchanan  c  places it in the reign of king Malcolm Canmore but Fordun the best and most ancient author says  "That in the beginning of the reign of king Alexander I  anno  there was a plot laid by the Mearns and Murray men then in rebellion to seize the king's person that a party of them actually beset his palace in the night that sir Alexander Carron one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber having timeously discovered it got his majesty by some private passage safely conveyed away  The king immediately raised what forces he could went in pursuit of the rebels and came in sight of them on the banks of the river Spey where they were encamped in a very great body on the other side  The water being then extremely high it was thought impossible at least very hazardous for the king's troops to pass however the king being incensed at the audaciousness of the rebels and eager to attack them though they were far superior in numbers gave his standard to his trusty friend sir Alexander Carron  quia noverat in viribus et audacia praevalere  Fordun vol I page  says Fordun who with it immediately jumped into the river got safe through fixed the royal standard and displayed the king's colours on the other side in sight of the enemy upon which the whole body passed The rebels seeing a royal army so near and ready to attack them were seized with a panick took to their heels and fled with great precipitation whereby the king obtained a compleat and easy victory but did not forget to reward the brave and faithful sir Alexander Carron he made him a grant of some lands and constituted him heretable standardbearer to the kings of Scotland the office to him and his heirsmale for ever He also gave him the sirname of Scrymgeour a hardy fighter which his posterity have enjoyed ever since"  He got likeways a part of the royal arms of Scotland for his armorial bearing  viz gules  a lion rampant  or  armed and langued  azure  Nisbet's appendix p  with a sword in his dexter paw proper hil  ed and pommelled of the d and to perpetuate the memory of the above action he took for motto  Dissipate  Buchanan in his account of the affair on the

miraculo adeo conterruit hostes ut passim in fugam statim se conjecerint c c  "  This sir Alexander Scrymgeour was son of Alexander Carron  Ibid and Abercrom vol I p  often mentioned with honour in the Scotch history  And though we can give no particular account of his marriage and issue yet as all our historians agree that sir Alexander Scrymgeour who flourished in the end of the reign of king Alexander III was his lineal representative therefore we deduce the descent of this noble family from him  I Sir ALEXANDER SCRYMGEOUR heretable standardbearer of Scotland inheriting the valour and

HAY Earl of ERROL  THE grandeur and antiquity of the great and illustrious name of HAY being sufficiently set forth and attested both by ancient and modern historians we shall only hint briefly at the traditional account of their origin as it is handed down to us by many eminent authors  In the reign of king Kenneth III the Danes having invaded Scotland about the year with a great and numerous army were opposed by king Kenneth who gave them battle near Loncartie in Perthshire where the Scots were worsted and fled  In their flight through a narrow pass they were met by a brave Scotsman and his two sons who were labouring their ground near by they stopt them encouraged them to rally telling them it was better and more honourable to die in the field fighting for their king and their country than to fly and afterwards be killed by the merciless Danes by thus upbraiding their cowardice they were prevailed upon to stop  There were many gallant men amongst them who fled more from the desertion of their companions than want of courage They joined the brave old man and his sons stopt all the flyers and soon got a considerable body of men together  The father and his sons having only such arms as their ploughs furnished them with led back their countrymen who returned to the charge They renewed the fight fell upon the Danes and made a most furious onset crying aloud Help is at hand The Danes believing that a f  esh army had fallen on them soon gave way whereby the Scots obtained a compleat victory and effectually freed their country from servitude  The battle being over the old man afterwards known by the name of Hay was brought to the king who gave him and his sons as a just reward of their valour and merit so much land on the side of the river Tay in the Carse of Gowrie as a falcon set off a man's hand should fly over before she settled She flew over about six miles of ground in length which was afterwards called Errol and has been the possession and chief title of the Hays their successors ever since  The king further promoted them to the order of the nobility and assigned them a coat of arms  viz argent  three se  tcheons  gules  to intimate that the father and the two sons had been the three fortunate shields of Scotland  Thus all ancient Scotch authors But  It appears from many histories that there were families of the name of Hay both in Italy and France even before the aera of the battle of Loncarty The late countess of Errol as head or chief of the Hays in Scotland had some time ago a most elegant letter from the learnedHay archbishop of Marnis wherein he mentions the above account of the battle of Loncarty as a piece of history contained in the memoirs of the Hays in Italy but says that the first of the Hays in Scotland and Italy

both from our histories and records though some traditional accounts deduce their origin and descent much higher  Mr Martin of Clermont a learned and judicious antiquary says that one Solvathius Forbes  Martin's gen collect v II p  married Moravilla daughter of king Gregory the great about the year and that all the Forbes's in Scotland are descended of him  Other historians say that one Achonacher a man of rank who came from Ireland having killed a monstrous wild boar took the name of Forbear  Nisbet vol I p  which was afterwards turned to Forbeas that he was ancestor of the Forbes's and that they took the boar's head for their armorial bearing in memory of their having killed the boar  Cambden says that one of the name of Bois in king John Baliol's time after kiling a mighty wild boar  Cambd fol edit p  was called Forbois which afterwards was turned to Forbes but this must be a mistake at least as to the aera for there were Forbes's in Scotland long before that time  It is alledged by others with more probability that Forbes is a local sirname and was first taken up by the proprietors of the lands and barony of Forbes soon after the reign of king Malcolm Canmore about which time several men of rank in Scotland assumed their sirnames from the lands they possessed and were progenitors of some of the most considerable families in the kingdom  We shall therefore pass over the traditional accounts and deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents from the first of them we find upon record  viz  I JOHN de FORBES a man of rank and figure who

with himself and all his sons were put to the sword  anno  but happily his lady being with child was delivered of a son who succeeded him and carried on the line of this family  This son who was also

this great and antient family wrote by good historians we shall here briefly deduce their descent from the best authorities  Fifus Duffus or Fyfe MacDuff was a man of vast wealth and power in the reign of king Kenneth II and gave that prince great assistance in his wars with the Picts about the year  After they were subdued about the year king Kenneth gave to this MacDuff in reward of his great and eminent services  Sir James Balfour's description of Fife  all the lands then called Otholinia which he himself had conquered from the Picts which extended from FifeNess to Clackmannan from east to west from the river Forth on the south to the river Tay and Earn on the north  This great tract of land he called Fi  e after his own name according to these words of Boethius  Boeth lib X p  regio ad id tempus Otholinia a Fi  o Duffo in Fifi nomen concessit c  As he was now proprietor of all Fyfe he was also appointed heretable thane thereof the highest jurisdiction then known in Scotland under our kings which dignity was enjoyed by his posterity in a direct maleline to that hero and eminent patriot MacDuff the eighth thane and first earl  I MACDUFF eighth thane afterwards earl of Fyfe was one of the greatest and most powerful subjects in the kingdom and as he was no less good than great he was consequently much dreaded by MacBeath the usurper  The great share he had in bringing about king Malcolm Canmore's restoration and his killing MacBeath with his own hand are facts so well known that it is needless here to insist on them  And as Malcolm was a prince both generous and grateful he did not fail to reward his benefactor according to his merit  Fordun vol I  He confirmed to him the county of Fyfe and created him earl thereof at his first  conventus procerum  held at Forfar  anno  or according to others  anno    He likeways conferred on him many great and noble privileges all to descend to his posterity  viz  st To have the honour of placing the kings of Scotland

very great antiquity in the west of Scotland but our antiquaries are not agreed about their origin  Frederic Van Bassen a learned Norvegian who wrote an account of the origin of several Scotch families  M S in the advocate's library Edr  says that one Malcolm son of Friskin assisted Malcolm prince of Scotland afterwards king Malcolm Canmore to make his escape from the tyranny of Macbeath who had murthered his father king Duncan and being hotly pursued he took shelter in a barn where Malcolm concealed the prince by forking straw or hay over him The pursuit being over the prince made his escape to England accompanied by his faithful Malcolm  Prince Malcolm was no sooner in possession of his kingdom than he rewarded his preserver with the Thanedom of Cunninghame from which his posterity assumed their sirname and took a shakefork for their arms with  Over fork over  for their motto to perpetuate the memory of this happy escape  Cambden says that the Cunninghames came originally from England which possibly may be true  Cambden folio edition p    for there came several persons of rank from that country to Scotland with king Malcolm Canmore and we find Cunninghames settled in the shire of Ayr very soon thereafter  Sir George MacKenzie is of opinion that the sirname is local and was first assumed by the proprietors of lands in Cunninghame where the ancestors of this noble family had great possessions in very early times and having the office of master of horse in the king's stables took for their armorial figure  Sir George MacKenzie's heraldry  the

CHIEF SEATS  At Kilmaurs in Cunningham and Finlayston in Renfrewshire on the banks of the river Clyde  GORDON Duke of GORDON  THOUGH there are many elegant histories of this ancient and illustrious family written by learned and judicious antiquaries yet they differ greatly as to their origin and first settlement in this island  Some bring them from Greece to Gaul and from thence to Scotland at least a thousand years ago others bring them from Italy others from Spain Flanders  c  Certain it is there were many considerable families of the name of Gordon in France long before the Norman conquest of England whose posterity we shall have occasion to mention hereafter and whose descendents are subsisting in France to this day  The most probable conjecture therefore is that some of these Gordons came to England with William the Conqueror  anno  and to Scotland with king Malcolm Canmore or his son king David I for it is well known that the ancestors of several of the best families in this kingdom are of Norman extract and came to Scotland with one or other of these princes  It is also said that in the reign of king Malcolm Canmore a valiant knight of the name of Gordon came to Scotland and was kindly received by that prince and having killed a wild boar which greatly infested the borders the generous Malcolm gave him a grant of several lands in the Merse or Berwickshire which he called Gordon after his own sirname He settled there took the boar's head for his armorial bearing in memory of his having killed that monstrous animal that he was progenitor of all the Gordons in Scotland and mention is made of Adam de Gordon the father and Adam his son in the reigns of the said Malcolm and David  It is most certain the Gordons were making no small figure in Scotland immediately after that aera we shall therefore insist no more on the historial accounts but proceed to deduce the descent of this great and most noble family by unquestionable authority from their immediate ancestor  I RICARDUS de GORDON said to be grandson of the knight who killed the boar or son of the second Adam He was a man of considerable distinction in Scotland in the reigns of king Malcolm IV and king William the Lion who succeeded Malcolm  anno    He was undoubtedly proprietor of the lands and barony of Gordon and others in Berwickshire which is instructed by a donation he

our readers to the lives of the officers of state page  c  where will be found a full account of his life and actions We shall only add that in the minority of king James VI  BishopSpotiswood  he was

author  "He was a nobleman  who in his life was much honoured and employed in the chief offices at court  Ibidem  a man wise but too curious and said to have consulted with wizards  c  He made this

Pittencrief  XVI JAMES eldest son of William first earl of Gowrie by the king's great lenity and goodness was restored to his father's estate and honours and was the second earl  He was a youth of great hopes and of a sweet disposition but died unmarried  anno  whereby the estate and honours devolved upon his brother  XVI JOHN third earl of Gowrie who with his brother Alexander made that audacious attempt upon the king's sacred person at Perth on the memorable fifth of August when both the brothers were slain in the enterprize  Though there are particular histories of Gowrie's conspiracy wrote by several historians yet we have only hereto subjoined the account given by a learned author  No transaction in the Scotch history can be so little accounted for as that of Gowrie's conspiracy A reason for an attempt so horrid is scarcely so much as hinted and the methods used even supposing such had been the intention were so preposterous that it cannot reconcile either with the character of the two young gentlemen or with the other circumstances of the story itself Nature and education had joined in adorning them especially the elder with the most noble accomplishments More learned than is usual among persons of their rank more religious than is common at their age of life generous brave popular their countrymen far from thinking them capable of any atrocious crime conceived the most sanguine hopes of their early virtues  This remarkable incident happened on the fifth August Historians tell us that as the king was going out in the morning to the chace from his palace of Falkland he was accosted by the younger of the two Ruthvens Alexander who with an air of secrecy and importance acquainted him that the evening before a stranger had been seized near his brother's house at Perth and secured and on searching him a vast quantity of foreign gold was found upon him The king immediately suspecting this unknown person to be a trafficking priest supplied with foreign coin in order to excite new commotions in the kingdom ordered him to be sent to Falkland but this Mr Ruthven strenuously opposed and with many arguments urged the king to proceed to Perth and examine into the matter himself The king whose curiosity was awakened by the strangeness of the affair promised to go when the chace was over during the whole of which Ruthven continued his importunity in so strong at manner that even after it was over he would not allow the king to wait a fresh horse but insisted on his setting out on the same he had hunted with the whole day Mr Ruthven too was very desirous that the king should set out without attendants but this he refused and with a train of about twenty persons set out for Perth  The earl of Gowrie apprised by his brother of the king's approach met him at a little distance from the town and conducted him to his house mean time no preparations for entertaining his majesty appeared the earl seemed embarassed nor did he apologize for the seanty fare with which he entertained his royal guest The king's repast being over his attendants were conducted by the earl to dine in another apartment At that time Mr Ruthven took the opportunity of whispering the king that now he might have an opportunity of seeing the unknown person The king desired sir Thomas Erskine to go with him but Mr Ruthven would not consent he then conducted the king by a narrow staircase through several apartments all of which he locked behind him till at last he came to a small room where instead of a fettered criminal as the king expected he found a man standing compleately armed with a sword and dagger at his side Ruthven upon his entrance snatched the dagger from the man's side and addressing the king spoke to him of his father's execution that he was now his prisoner and at his mercy but added that if he would be quiet and make no noise his life should be in safety He then delivered back the man the dagger told him to take care of the king and at same time binding the king with an oath not to make any noise or disturbance during his absence he returned to acquaint his brother with what he had done  Mean while the king's attendants impatient at his not appearing inquired at Gowrie what had become of him at that instant one of Gowrie's domestics entered the room and acquainted them that the king had just mounted his horse and rode off for Falkland on which all of them immediately left the house and called for their horses At this time Mr Ruthven had returned to the king and told him that now he behoved to die and at same time offered to bind his hands Unarmed as the king was he would not submit to such an indignity but closing with Mr Ruthven a fierce struggle ensued during which the man in armour stood by trembling dismaid and motionless without offering the least assistance to his master or violence to the king  In the scuffle the king had pulled Mr Ruthven near a window part of which was open and putting out his head called out with a wild affrighted voice Treason Murder His attendants knew the voice and observing a hand at the window collaring the king they immediately rushed up stairs to his assistance The greater number took the principal staircase but found all the doors fast which while they were attempting to force open sir John Ramsay entered by a back stair and seeing Mr Ruthven struggling with the king drew his dagger plunged it twice into his body then pulled him from the king and threw him down stairs where he was met by sir Thomas Erskine and sir Hugh Herries who with their daggers dispatched him Mr Ruthven calling out with his last breath alas alas I am not to blame During this scuffle the man in armour who had been concealed in the apartment made his escape unknown  There were now in the apartment with the king Ramsay Erskine and Herries and one Wilson a footman who entered the room along with them Before they had time to congratulate the king on his narrow escape the earl came up the same backstair and rushed in with a sword in each hand attended by seven servants compleatly armed threatening them all with immediate death Notwithstanding the inequality of the numbers the three gentlemen immediately attacked the earl and sir John Ramsay having run him through the heart his followers immediately fled  The king's attendants who were endeavouring to force a passage from the other staircase were now let in and with transports of joy congratulated the king on his deliverance and he falling on his knees with his attendants around him offered thanks to God for his wonderful preservation  The danger however was not quite over the inhabitants of Perth hearing of the death of the earl their beloved provost and patron surrounded the house and vowed vengeance against the king but the magistrates being admitted into the king's presence and acquainted with the fact they by their influence by degrees appeased the multitudes who soon after dispersed The king then returned to Falkland having left the care of the dead bodies of the earl and his brother to the magistrates  Such is the story handed down to us by many writers but all of them are at a loss to account for the motives of a conduct so contrary to the known character of these two brothers whose gentle and peaceable dispositions made them idolized by all who knew them  Three of Gowrie's servants were afterwards hanged at Perth for being concerned in the attempt but from them no light could be drawn into this intricate affair and the man who was concealed in the study and who upon promise of pardon had revealed himself and proved to be the earl's steward was as much a stranger to his master's design as the rest and though placed in the study by the earl's immediate command he did not even know for what end that station was assigned him the truth of which seems strongly to appear from his behaviour to the king while alone in the apartment with him and when instead of appearing to have a design upon his life or liberty he stood motionless trembling and affrighted in short altogether unfit for so horrid an office  All the honours and estates of the earldom  of Gowrie were forfeited and annexed to the crown and the fifth of August in time coming ordered to be regularly observed as a day of thanksgiving in remembrance of his majesty's happy

c  GRAY Lord GRAY  BOTH Scotch and English antiquaries agree that the noble and antient sirname of Gray is originally from France and that Fulbert great chamberlain to Robert duke of Normandy got from that prince the castle and honour of Croy  alias  Gray in Picardy from which he assumed his sirname  This Fulbert had a son  John lord Gray  Peerage of England vol II p  who succeeded himand a daughter  Arlette who was mother of William the Conqueror  Certain it is there were several of that sirname came from France to Britain with that great prince  anno  and had considerable commands in his army and as he divided the lands of England amongst his brave officers  Ibidem  we find that the Grays got a large share made a great figure and became very numerous soon after William was master of the country They were progenitors of several noble families that have flourished with great lustre in that kingdom ever since  Salmon's abridgment p  viz  the dukes of Suffolk and Kent the marquis of Dorset the earls of Tankerville and Stamford the barons Gray of Codnor Ruthin Wilton Roleston Wark and Chillingham  c  from which last is descended the lord Gray in Scotland  In the northern counties there are still many antient families of that name which enjoy considerable estates as appears from the acts of parliament nominating the justices of the peace commissioners of supply  c  in those parts  And it is observable that the Grays in Scotland carry the same armorial bearings with those in the north of England which may be seen in their churches tombstones and other monuments of antiquity and as Northumberland formerly belonged to Scotland it is the general opinion that lord Gray of Chillingham of that county whose predecessor came over with William the Conqueror gave the lands of Browfield or Broxmouth in the county of Roxburgh adjoining to it to a younger son of his family of whom all the Grays in Scotland are said to be descended  But both Scotch and English historians who assert that the Grays came first into Scotland in the reign of king James I  Cambden Boethius Buchanan c  are in a mistake for we have undoubted proof that they were settled and making a figure in this country near two hundred years before that aera or above five hundred years ago  And though we cannot six the precise time of their coming yet we shall deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents in a direct line from  I Sir HUGH de GRAY a man of considerable rank and figure in the reign of king Alexander II who succeeded to the crown  anno  was then proprietor of the lands of Browfield or Broxmouth in Roxburghshire  Nisbet vol I p  and is particularly documented by a charter of Walter de Lundin to his kinsman Philip de Feodary ancestor of the

believing it might put an end to the wars and perpetual sends that had so long subsisted betwixt the two nations but the earls of Huntly Argyle Montrose Bothwell Menteith lord Fleming and many other worthy Scotsmen opposed it strenuously being convinced that it would prove derogatory to the dignity and independency of Scotland so that it could never be got accomplished though king Henry VIII had it very much at heart  There was then a treaty on foot with the English the articles whereof were agreed to by a Scotch parliament king Henry not only refused to ratify it but caused seize several Scotch ships laden with Scotch and French commodities upon the faith of the treaty which they thought was concluded This notorious violation of the articles the governor resented highly and in December called a parliament who declared the treaty void and null and the governor immediately raised what forces he could to oppose the English who had invaded our country with an army of seven or eight thousand men under the command of lord Evers The Scots encountered them near Ancrum in Teviotdale with an army not half their number and totally defeated them  Some time thereafter the earl of Hertford invaded Scotland with another army and the governor being now joined by French auxiliaries marched to oppose them but upon the approach of the Scots the English retreated  The governor in his turn invaded England defeated the English wherever he met them and returned crowned with laurels and his soldiers laden with great booty He had then the ensigns of the most noble order of St Michael

supported by a strong fleet The governor of Scotland encountered them at Pinkycleugh where the Scots behaved with the utmost courage and resolution but being overpowered by numbers were at last totally defeated and about of them killed in the field on th September  The governor not at all dismayed with this loss appointed a meeting of the nobility at Stirling and in a most pathetic speech he first condoled with them for their loss at Pinky then he put them in mind of the great spirit and magnanimity with which their ancestors had defended themselves and maintained their independency against their implacable enemies  c  This had such an effect upon them that they unanimously resolved rather to hazard all than submit to the English  They then applied to their old allies the French and at the same time proposed a match betwixt their young queen and the dolphin son of king Francis I who was then pleased to create the governor duke of Chattelherault  Extract from the register of

he had delivered up the  regalia  and ensigns of government  When queen Mary returned from France  anno  the duke of Chattelherault who was a great friend to the reformation was appointed one of the privy council and in was sent to France to take care of her majesty's interest there where he continued till the queen was forced to make a resignation of the government in favours of her son upon which he was called home to be head of the loyalists He used all his interest to get the earl of Murray degraded and did every thing in his power for her majesty's service but at last when he found that all attempts to get the queen restored to the government were in vain he entered into an agreement with the regent for himself the earl of Cassilis lord Herris and others of the queen's friends the articles whereof are at large in Crawford's peerage of Scotland page  c  Upon the faith of which the duke came to Edinburgh trusting to the regent's engagements but was no sooner in his power than he was confined in the castle of Edinburgh where he was kept prisoner till the regent was put to death by James Hamilton of Bothwelhaugh on d January  The earl of Lennox being then made regent the duke with his two sons and many more of his name and family were outlawed and forfeited however the duke continued firm and steady in the queen's interest to the very last and for his untainted

He was most zealous in support of the queen's cause in opposition to those who assumed the government in the name of king James her son was deeply engaged in the civil wars that ensued thereupon and never deserted the interest of queen Mary in her deepest distress  When she was carried prisoner to the castle of Lochleven the commendator entered into that memorable association with several others of the nobility obliging themselves to stand by one another in defence of the queen and to endeavour to procure her liberty at the hazard of their lives and fortunes  c  for which and his other acts of loyalty he with his brother lord Claud was by the ruling faction at the time outlawed and sorfeited as before hinted  anno    He then made his escape to France where he continued in banishment for several years and the queen was so sensible of his unshaken fidelity that when that cruel sentence of death was passed upon her in England she pulled a ring off her finger and ordered one of her servants to deliver it to her cousin lord John Hamilton as a token of the just sense she had of his constant fidelity and sufferings for her interest which ring is still preserved in the family  When he heard that the king had begun to take the management of affairs upon himself he returned to Scotland  anno  and being joined by his brother lord Claud with several others of the nobility they advanced with what forces they could raise to Stirling where the king then was and represented to him that as their enemies had contrived their ruin and had deprived them of all other means of imploring his protection they were reduced to the hard neceslity of coming in that manner They were then admitted into  the king's presence and received their pardons and the king addressing himself to lord John said  "My lord I never did see you before and must confess that you have been wronged You was a faithful servant to my mother and hardly used when I understood not the state of things as I now do"  Lord John was soon thereafter made governor of Dunbarton castle and admitted of the privy council  When the king went to Norway to bring home his queen  Rymer tom XVI p ad annum  he deputed

bedchamber and master of horse  anno    Anno  he had the honour to represent the king of Bohemia and stood godfather to king Charles II  The same year by the king's direction he entered into treaty with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to raise men for the service of that prince to be employed against the Imperialists for the recovery of the Palatinate  Ibidem  with which force he sailed from Yarmouth the following year having just before his departure been elected and installed knight of the most noble order of the garter  In he was sent by the king into Scotland to endeavour to appease the commotions beginning there and was made his majesty's high commissioner to the general assembly of the kirk but they were then become so very untractable that according to his instructions he was obliged to dissolve them The next year he had the command of the fleet that was sent to try to bring the covenanters to reason the king having advanced as far as Berwick with about six thousand land forces and by the marquis's mediation a treaty was set on foot and a pacification ensued  But as the behaviour and conduct of this great man during the whole course of the civil war is recorded by many able historians we shall say little more of it here but for his good and faithful services to the crown  Chart in pub archiv  he was created duke of Hamilton marquis of Clydsdale  c  by patent in which all the  titles of the family are narrated  "to him and the heirsmale of his body which failing to the heirsmale of his brother the earl of Lanark his body which failing to the eldest heirfemale

 dated th April  anno    We shall here add also the speech he made to the Scotch parliament against delivering up the king to the English which was in these words  "Will Scotland now quit her possession and interest in her sovereign and do it to those whose emnity to him and us doth visibly appear  Crawfurd's peerage and Scots compend p  Is this the consequence of all your protestations of duty and affection to his majesty Is this the keeping of your covenant wherein you have sworn to defend the king's majesty person and authority Is this a suitable return for the king's goodness both in consenting to all your desires in and in his late trusting his person with you What censures will the world pass upon this action What a stain will it be to the whole reformed religion and what danger may we not apprehend both to the king's person and to Scotland from the party that now prevails in England"  However all he could do or say did not prevail the king was delivered up to the English the fatal consequence of which we need not repeat  The duke who did every thing in his power to wipe off that everlasting stain upon the Scotch nation at the parliament prevailed so far that it was agreed to raise an army in defence and for the relief of the king  c  of which the duke of Hamilton got the command He marched directly into England was attacked by the parliament's forces near Preston where his army was totally deseated and himself taken prisoner  After several months confinement he was brought to a trial before that infamous high court of justice where he received sentence of death and was accordingly beheaded in Palaceyard Westminster on th March a few weeks after one of the best of kings had suffered the same sate  He died with undaunted courage and remarkable tranquillity and composure of mind declared his steady and firm attachment to the protestant religion and prayed for the restoration of the royal family the moment besore he laid his head upon the block  He married lady Mary Fielding daughter of William earl of Denbigh by Susanna his wife sister to George Villiers the great duke of Buckinghame and by her had three sons and three daughters  Charles  James  William  All the above sons died young  st daughter lady  Mary  died young  Lady  Anne  who became dutchess of Hamilton of whom more afterwards  Lady  Susanna  married to John earl of

honour and integrity  Chart in archiv Careli  and was soon distinguished by king Charles I by whom he was highly esteemed and raised to the honour of the peerage when he was a young man by the titles of earl of Lanark lord Machanshire and Polmont by letters patent dated st March  Upon the death of the earl of Stirling  Ibid et chart penes ducem de Hamilton  he was appointed secretary of state for Scotland  anno  and was made knight of the most noble order of the garter  We shall not trouble our readers with an account of his noble conduct during the civil war it being fully set forth in the histories of these times we shall only add that after the murder of the king he raised a troop of horse at his own charge for the service of king Charles II in order to his restoration with which he marched to the fatal battle of Worcester fought valiantly upon their head on d September and received a wound in his leg of which he died in eight days thereafter and was buried in the cathedral of Worcester  We shall conclude this great man's character with the earl of Clarendon's words who will not be suspected of partiality in his favours  "He was a man not inferior in partsor understanding to the wisest men in the nation of great honour courage and sincerity in his nature and which was a rare virtue in the men of that time was still the same man he pretended to be and in truth was in all respects a very accomplished person of an excellent judgment and ready expression and though he had been been driven into some unwarrantable actions he made it evident that he had not been led by any inclination of his own and heartily run into all opportunies of redeeming  it and in the very article of his death he exprest a great chearfulness that he had the honour to lose his life in the king's service and thereby to wipe out the memory of his former transgressions which he always professed were odious to himself"  He married lady Elizabeth Maxwell daughter and coheiress of James earl of Dirleton by whom he had a son  James  who died an infantand four daughters  Lady  Anne  married to Robert earl of Southesk and had issue  Lady  Elizabeth  married st to James lord Kilmaurs eldest

descending by several patents to the heirs general he was succeeded by his niece lady Anne to whom we now return  XIV Lady ANNE HAMILTON eldest daughter of James first duke of Hamilton the undoubted heir of line of the family and now dutchess of Hamilton married William Douglas earl of Selkirk eldest son of William marquis of Douglas by his second wife lady Mary Gordon daughter of George marquis of Huntly in consequence of which marriage upon a petition from the dutchess he was created duke of Hamilton for life with all the titles dignities and precedency belonging to the family which appears by the diploma  Diploma in archivis Caroli II  Willielmi ducis de Hamilton marchionis Clydsdale comitis Arraniae Lanarc  ae et Selkirk domini Acon Machanshire et Daer c  dated th October  He was soon thereafter made one of the privy council and knight of the most noble order of the garter  Upon king James VII's accession to the crown he was made a lord of the treasury an extraordinary lord of session and a privy councillor for both kingdoms in which office he continued all king James's reign  When the prince of Orange came over to England he was chosen by divers Scotch nobility and gentry then in London to be their president when they addressed that prince to take upon him the administration of all affairs civil and military and was also chosen president of the convention of estates who declared the crown vacant and settled it on that prince  After he was crowned king the duke was appointed president of the council one of the extraordinary lords of session and lord high admiral of Scotland  By said lady Anne dutchess of Hamilton he left issue seven sons and three daughters    James  earl of Arran  Lord  William  who died in France without issue    Charles  earl of Selkirk

liberal education suitable to his high birth and quality  Upon his return from his travels he was particularly distinguished by king Charles II  Hist of England vol III  and was made one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber  anno  and was sent ambassador extraordinary to the court of France  When king James VII succeeded to the crown he was made master of the wardrobe knight of the thistle and colonel of the royal regiment of horse  He was steady in the interest of that unfortunate prince and never left him till he embarked for France d December and was always suspected of retaining a warm affection to him even when the revolution had altered the system of government and directed the subjects allegiance to a new king which plainly appears from the speech he made in the beginning of when the prince of Orange asked the opinion of the Scotch  nobility and gentry then at London in relation to the affairs in Scotland Upon this occasion the earl of Arran delivered his opinion as follows  "I have all the honour and deference for the prince of Orange imaginable I think him a brave prince  Miscellaneous collections of the year Crawfurd's peerage p  and that we owe him great obligations in contributing so much to our delivery from popery but while I pay those praises I cannot violate my duty to my master I must distinguish between his popery and his person I dislike the one but have sworn and do owe allegiance to the other which makes it impossible for me to assign away that which I cannot forbear believing is the king my master's right for his present absence from us in France can no more affect my duty than his longer absence from us has done before and the prince desiring our advice mine is that we should move his majesty to return and call a free parliament for the securing our religion and property which in my humble opinion will at last be found the best way to heal all our breaches"  After king William was established in the throne the earl of Arran was twice sent prisoner to the tower on suspicion of corresponding with king James but was never prosecuted however he lived a retired life the greatest part of king William's reign  His father being created duke only for life  Charta penes ducem deHamilton et Chart in pub archiv  as before noticed the hereditary honours of the family still remained in the dutchess and did not descend to the earl of Arran

grandfather's patent in as if he had succeeded thereto by his father's death This patent is dated at Loo th August  He opposed the union of the two crowns and at the invasion was by order of council taken into the custody of a messenger upon suspicion of his being privy to that expedition but he was soon admitted to bail the duke of Newcastle earl of Wharton and lord Halifax being his sureties and that same year he was elected one of the sixteen peers for Scotland to the British parliament  In he was created a peer of GreatBritain by the titles of duke of Brandon and baron Dutton in England by patent the preamble whereof which is very honourable for the family is to be found in the Scots compendium page but in December the same year his English peerage was disputed in the British parliament and was found to be inconsistent with the articles of union and was therefore at that time set aside  In he was constituted master of the ordnance and knight of the most noble order of the garter as well as the thistle the queen having declared she would wear both orders herself and immediately thereafter upon the conclusion of the treaty of Utrecht he was appointed her majesty's ambassador extraordinary to the court of France but a little before he was to have set out for that kingdom he fought a duel with lord Mohun wherein they were both killed on th November  Had not the duke been a man of uncommon bravery he might well have refused the challenge being a privy councillor and her majesty's ambassador extraordinary but that he thought was inconsistent with his honour and some suspected he was killed unfairly by general MacCartney lord Mohun's second who after king George's accession to the crown stood his trial and was acquitted  His grace's mother Anne the

anno    "William master of Newbottle succeeded to the honours of Jedburgh and on that title voted in parliament  anno  where his father the marquis of Lothian also sat and voted as marquis of Lothian and upon his father's decease he succeeded to the honours of Lothian Therefore if a judgment were to be formed on what thus appears it would be natural to conclude that the honours of Jedburgh and Lothian are conjoined in the same person but as it appears that the present marquis of Lothian in his father's lifetime voted  anno  at the election of a peer to sit in parliament in the room of earl Marishal then deceased under the character of lord Jedburgh it is not impossible that the family of Lothian may be possessed of some settlement in this peerage of Jedburgh different from what has

of this great and illustrious family had large possessions in lands and were designed thanes of Argyle before they were lords of the Isles  It appears also that while the islands called Aebudae held

flourished in the reign of king David I who succeeded to the crown of Scotland  anno  and died in  It is acknowledged by all our historians that this Somerled was a man of great power and interest He married the daughter and heiress of Olaus one of the kings of the Aebudae whereupon he and his posterity for several generations assumed to themselves the title of kings of the Isles  Somerled being no less ambitious than great raised an army and invaded the territories of Malcom IV who succeeded David was joined by Donald son of Malcolm MacBeth who had been at the head of a formidable rebellion in the preceeding reign but king Malcolm sent the brave Gilchrist earl of Angus against them  Abercrombie vol I p  who defeated them took Donald prisoner and obliged Somerled to fly to Ireland  anno

son of Somerled was also designed king of the Isles but it does not appear from our histories that he gave any disturbance to king William who succeeded Malcolm  anno  yet he never acknowledged him to be his superior  Rymer  but entered into a league with the king of England against his country as an independent prince  He was very liberal in his donations to the religious  He founded and endowed

certainly progenitor of the whole clan of MacDonald and though we do not find him designed king yet he is often called lord of the Isles Ergyle Inchgall  c  and it does not appear that he ever

generous action and was succeeded by his eldest son  VI ANGUS lord of the Isles commonly called Angus More or the great Angus and indeed he was a man of great worth and honour a firm and steady friend of king Robert Bruce  At the battle of Bannockburn  anno  he charged upon the head of of his own men  Ibidem  with remarkable bravery and conduct and had no small share of the honour gained by the Scots on that memorable day  He was so much a true and faithful subject to king Robert that he never once asserted his own independency as king or lord of the Isles as long as he lived  He married a daughter of the family of OCaine  M S of the family  the chiestain of a great tribe in the kingdom of Ireland by whom he had a son and s  ccessor  VII JOHN lord of the Isles a man of great spirit but he did not inherit the loyalty and virtues of his father and grandfather He turned an enemy to his young sovereign king David Bruce and joined Edward Baliol which appears from a ratification by the king of England  Rymer tom IV p  of an indenture entered into betwixt Edward Baliol king of Scotland and John lord of the Isles  c anno    That same year he got a charter from king Edward as he is then called of the lands of Kintyre Knapdale the islands of Mull Skye Lewis and a great many others for which he obliged himself by all means possible to molest and annoy the enemies of Edward  c  He afterwards got a safe conduct to go up to England  Ibid p  anno  and it seems he then set up for an independent prince  Ibid tom V  for as such king Edward of England entered into a league offensive

was progenitor of the MacDonalds of Moydart Clanronald  c  of whom Glengary Moror  c  are descended but whether he was a son of a former marriage or older or younger than John's successor we shall not pretend to determine  But as the different branches of the clan MacDonald do not agree about this part of their history we shall only make an obvious remark or two upon the preceeding charters and leave the determination of the points in dispute to the judgment of our readers  John of the Isles got his first charter under the great seal of all the lands therein mentioned  "to himself and his heirsgeneral holding of the king"  before narrated  About ten months thereafter he gave a considerable estate to his son Reginald and the heirsmale of his body confirmed and approved by the king not holding of the crown but of John himself and his heirs whereby John's lawful successor became Reginald's superior and in the charter Reginald is neither designed  filius legitimus  nor  dilectus filius  the common stile in old charters but simply  filius meus  therefore by any thing that appears upon record John's lawful heir was a different person from Reginald  John died in the end of or beginning of and was insallibly succeeded in all the estates he died possessed of and in the superiority of the other lands he had given off to his children by his son  VIII DONALD lord of the isles who it seems set out upon an independent sooting for Richard king of England entered into a treaty with him as a sovereign prince  Rymer tom VII  anno  and his father John is then said to be  nuper defunitus  This Donald was a man of an aspiring genius and had vast possessions  Chart in pub archiv  he gave off parts of his lands to his friends and neighbours  viz  the MacLeans MacIntoshes MacKenzies MacKinnons  c  all holding of himself for military service which greatly encreased his power but upon the forfeiture of this family these clans got their lands holding of the crown  In the year Donald lord of the isles and John de Isle his brother got a safe conduct from king Henry IV  Rymer tom VIII p  to come to England with one hundred horse in their retinue to treat of a peace with the English for themselves and their friends  The king of England afterwards gave power to his commissioners to treat of a final peace with them in their own country  Ibid p  anno    In a truce concluded betwixt the king of England and France  Ibid tom IX  Donald lord of the Isles and John Stanely of Man are included as independent princes  anno    They are again both included in a treaty with France as allies of England  Ibid tom XII p  anno  whereby it appears that this lord was more in the English interest than the Scotch  He married dame Margaret Lesly only daughter of Walter Lesly by lady Eupheme eldest daughter and coheiress of William the last male of the antient earls of Ross and upon whose heirs the estate and honours of Ross were settled by act of parliament By her he had a son  Alexander  his heir  As the battle of Harlaw happened in consequence of this marriage we shall briefly account for it as follows  Walter Lesly who married Eupheme countess of Ross besides his daughter married to the lord of the isles had a son Alexander who became earl of Ross as heir to his mother He married Isabel daughter of Robert duke of Albany governor of Scotland by whom he had an only daughter Eupheme countess of Ross his sole heiress she became a nun and died without issue whereby the successi on to the earldom of Ross in right of blood ought to have devolved upon the said dame Margaret Lesly lady of the Isles her undoubted heir of line  But the duke of Albany having obtained from his grandchild Eupheme the nun a resignation of her honours in favours of his second son the earl of Buchan  Resign penes comitem de Rothes  and failing heirsmale of his body to fall to the crown the earl of Buchan thereupon added that of Ross to his other titles  Donald lord of the Isles claimed that earldom in right of his wife the duke of Albany determined his son should have it in virtue of the nun's resignation  Donald being denied what he thought he had a just title to resolved to assert his right by force of arms and raised an army of about  ten thousand men chiefly of his own friends and followers the clans beforementioned  The duke was not behindhand with him in raising forces  Fordun vol II p  but soon got together an army much about the same number commanded by the brave Alexander Stewart earl of Mar  They met near a village called Harlaw within ten miles of Aberdeen where a most bloody battle ensued fought with incredible obstinacy on both sides  Ibidem  in which many brave men lost their lives but neither had reason to brag much of the victory The lord of the isles rather wearied than conquered retreated the next day and the earl of Mar was not in a condition to pursue him This happened  anno    It seems Donald afterwards made up matters with the governor for the earl of Buchan possessed the earldom of Ross without further disturbance till he was slain at the battle of Vernoil in France  anno  then that earldom came to the crown in virtue of the resignation by Eupheme the nun  Chart in pub archiv  beforementioned This is fully instructed by many charters under the great seal to be seen in our public records though it does not appear that the said dame Margaret lady of the Isles ever gave up her title  Fordun vol II  for she always designed herself countess of Ross even after the crown was in possession of that earldom  Donald died in France  anno  and was succeeded by his son  IX ALEXANDER afterwards earl of Ross of whom Buchanan says he was  unus post regem longe potenti  simus c  In his mother's lifetime he designed himself  dominus insularum et magister comitatus Rossiae  for it seems he still intended to assert his title to that earldom He raised an army of above ten thousand men burnt the town of Inverness and laid waste a great part of the country The king being highly incensed at this insolence raised an army to oppose him  Ibid p  and came up with him in Lochaber The clan Chatton and the Camerons seeing the standard of their lawful sovereign deserted the lord of the Isles whose forces being immediately attacked by the king's troops were soon routed and put to slight in the year  Sometime thereafter Alexander repenting of his disloyal practices threw himself at the king's feet  Ibid p  and implored mercy who notwithstanding his open rebellion was graciously pleased to pardon him  At last king James out of his great goodness and love of justice yielded the earldom of Ross to him being sensible he had a good title to it in right of his mother who was really heir of line of the family as before observed by which accession to his estate he became one of the greatest and most powerful subjects in the kingdom  This Alexander earl of Ross grants a charter to John Ross of Kilravock in liferent and his son Hugh his apparent heir in fee  Chart in pub archiv  of the lands of Kilravock EasterGeddes  c  upon Kilravock's resignation to the earl as his lawful superior d June confirmed by a charter under the great seal  In the minority of king James II he was by the estates of the kingdom  Ibidem  appointed justiciar of Scotland benorth the river Forth and it is acknowledged he kept all that country in peace and good order as long as he lived  He granted several charters and other deeds as earl of Ross and lord of the Isles  Ibidem  all confirmed by charters under the great seal which is a sufficient proof that the crown acquieseed in his possession of that earldom  He married Elizabeth  Charta penes ducem de Gordon  daughter of sir Alexander Seton lord of Gordon and sister of Alexander first earl of Huntly by whom he had three sons and two daughters    John  his heir    Hugh  progenitor of the MacDonalds of Slate as will be shown hereafter    Celestine  ancestor of lord MacDonald  Vide  title lord MacDonald  st daughter  Hist of the family of Sutherland  Margaret  married to John earl of Sutherland and was mother of Elizabeth heiress of that noble family    Florence  Chart in pub archiv  married to Duncan MacIntosh captain of the clan Chatton  This earl died in the end of or beginning of and was succeeded by his eldest son  X JOHN earl of Ross and lord of the Isles who was certainly one of the greatest and most powerful men in the kingdom and behaved like a dutiful and loyal subject excepting his engagement with the earl of Douglas as long as king James II lived with whom he appeared to be in great favour  There was a truce concluded with the English in November  Rymer tom XI p c  in which John earl of Ross was one of the guarantees and to another in  And though he was engaged in the earl of Douglas's rebellion yet it is certain he made his peace with the king very soon thereafter for in the year he is one of the guarantees of a treaty with the English  Ibid p and  and one of the wardens of the marches and again in  But after the death of king James II he begun  to revive the old pretensions of his family to independency and shaking off his allegiance to his lawful sovereign he entered into a treaty with the king of England in the following terms  viz  "That John de Yle earl of Ross and lord of the Isles Donald Balagh and John of Yle son and heir apparent of the said Donald and all their subjects  The MacDonalds of Moydart or Clanronald  men people and inhabitants of the earldom of Ross and Isles  c  become liegemen and subjects to king Edward IV his heirs  c  to do homage  c  and that they shall remain for ever subjects to the kings of England and assist them against all their enemies  c  King Edward on the other part agrees and gives the earl of Ross during life a yearly pension of one hundred merks sterling in time of peace and two hundred pounds sterling in time of war and twenty pounds sterling to Donald Balagh in time of peace and forty pounds sterling in time of war and further in case of a treaty for a final peace betwixt the two kingdoms that England shall not agree with Scotland without getting the earl of Ross  Rymer tom XI p  c  comprehended in it  c  "  This treaty was concluded th February but was kept secret for several years  Ibidem  and was never discovered till there was actually a final peace concluded between Scotland and England by an article whereof it was provided that both the respective kings should renounce all former engagements made against each other the English were thereby obliged to produce their treaty with the earl of Ross by which this treasonable intrigue came to light  anno    In the interim the earl of Ross got charters under the great seal from king James III  Chart in pub archiv  of many lands and baronies  inter    et    At last John earl of Ross was summoned before the parliament was indicted for high treason found guilty and by sentence of the three estates  Records of parliament  was outlawed and forfeited and the earldom of Ross unalienably annexed to the crown by act of parliament  Soon thereafter the earl submitted to the king who out of his great elemency restored him to all the honours lands and islands he possessed as lord of the Isles with the approbation of parliament  Chart in pub archiv  "to him and the heirsmale of his body

treat of a peace with the English when a truce was concluded  After the death of king James II the lord Boyd was appointed justiciar of Scotland and one of the lords of the regency together with the archbishops of St Andrews and Glasgow  Lives of the offic of state  the bishop of Dunkeld the earl of Orkney the lords Graham Kennedy and Evandale who was chancellor and it is acknowledged by all our historians that the affairs of the nation were for several years managed with great prudence equity and justice  The lord Boyd was twice sent one of the ambassadors extraordinary to the court of England  Rymer tom XI p and  in the years and and conducted his negociations with great dexterity honour and fidelity  After the death of archbishop Kennedy the chief management of all public affairs devolved upon the lord Boyd who was a man of fine address and great authority and power His brother sir Alexander was employed to teach the king the manly and military exercises and consequently much about his person in short there was scarce any body could have access to his Majesty without the Boyds permission The king was still in the palace of Linlithgow where the lord Kennedy one of the regents and no friend of the Boyds kept a very watchful eye over him the lord Boyd therefore thought it necessary for his own interest to have his majesty out of lord Kennedy's hands which by the blind of a huntingmatch no doubt with his majesty's approbation he accomplished and got him safely conducted to Edinburgh much against the lord Kennedy's inclination but where he was afterwards entirely under the direction of the Boyds  However lord Boyd like a wife statesman prevailed with the king to call a parliament wherein it was declared that the lord Boyd had done the king and country good service  Records of parliament  in bringing his majesty from Linlithgow to Edinburgh and he was entirely acquitted thereof this act of exoneration past th October And further the lord Boyd was

advice and concurrence of those joined in commission with him by parliament such as the king's marriage his brother's the duke of Albany earl of Mar  c  About this time the lord Boyd's eldest son who was certainly one of the most accomplished young men in the kingdom married lady Mary Stewart the king's eldest sister with the consent and approbation of his majesty He got by her a great accession to his estate and was by king James III created earl of Arran this indeed greatly aggrandized his family and at the same time was one of the causes of its being so soon pulled down and brought to ruin  They became greatly envied by some and for their exorbitant power and their having engrossed the whole authority of the nation to themselves were as much hated by others And tho' there are no particular misdemeanors or acts of oppression laid to their charge yet their enemies became innumerable  The old lord was obliged to be much from court in the execution of his office of great chamberlain his son the earl of Arran was at Denmark upon an embassy and his lady with him who always accompanied him wherever he went The enemies of the family took that opportunity of working their ruin They first got the king's favour and affection alienated from them they then prevailed with his majesty to call a parliament in to which lord Boyd his son the earl of Arran and his brother sir Alexander Boyd of Duncow were summoned to appear and answer for such crimes as should be exhibited against them The old lord being sensible of the great authority and power of the faction that was formed against him and being also shocked at the king's so suddenly withdrawing his countenance from him  Lives  offic of state  did not think fit to appear and stand his trial but retired to England and died at Alnwick the year thereafter  anno    His son the earl of Arran was out of the kingdom so could not attend but his brother sir Alexander trusting to his own innocence appeared and stood his trial The chief crime of which they were all accused was their carrying off the king from Linlithgow to Edinburgh which was declared treason and tho' they were all acquitted for that crime  Acts of parliament  by act of parliament  anno  as before observed yet the torrent against them was now become so violent that the old lord and his son were found guilty of treason condemned in absence and all their estates and honours were forfeited to the crown Sir Alexander who stood his trial was found guilty art and part of carrying the king from Linlithgow condemned and executed on the Castlehill

of Scotland to meet with the assembly of divines at Westminster in in order to newmodel the government of the church  In he was one of the commissioners from the estates of Scotland to treat with the

accomplished at that time Before the earl got back to Scotland the bloody tragedy of his majesty's murder was perpetrated and the earl returned directly to Holland to offer his service to the prince

kingdoms of Scotland England and Ireland  As this great man hath been most unjustly aspersed by some historians we shall take the liberty to sum up his character in the words of an author of good reputation  North's examination of the history of the reign of king Charles II p  who though an Englishman seems to have examined the whole conduct of this Scotsman without prejudice and says  "It is well known that by the prudent conduct of the duke of Lauderdale Scotland was in a posture not only of safety but of giving assistance to the king if needed  He was an inexpugnable loyalist and keeped the door of Scotland close shut that no harm could get in or out there while he was commissioner which in the sense of the earl of Shaftsbury and his party was the worst of offences  In the mean time all the party foulmouths vented against him the utmost obloquy that could possibly be imagined as if he had been the basest of men and the modern timeserving historians chime in with it though most injurious to the character and honour of the best and wisest of statesmen that ever England had  c  "  John duke of Lauderdale married st lady Anne daughter and coheiress of Alexander earl of Home by

antiquaries claim the honour of the origin of this noble family  Doctor Keatine Peter Walsh c  and assert that their first ancestor came from Ireland  Some Scotch authors alledge that they are descended from Alexander second son of Kenneth thane of Lochaber  Mr Simson's essays Hist of the Stewarts c  and immediate younger brother of Bancho predecessor of the Scotch royal family  But the following narration will make it plainly appear that they came from England  Although upon the great victory obtained by William duke of Normandy afterwards called the Conqueror over Harold king of England at Hastings in October all the southern provinces of England submitted quietly to the government of the victor yet several earls great lords and powerful barons in the northern provinces much attached to their old race of kings and impatient of servitude stood up valiantly in defence of their liberties and the independency of their country and having carried on a bloody but unsuccessful war against the Conqueror whom they looked upon as an usurper were at last compelled to leave their country abandon their estates and save their lives by flying to Scotland where they were kindly received by king Malcolm III as will be shown hereafter  The most eminent of these families was the ancestor of the Dunbars earls of March who are treated of under that title page of this work  The next was the progenitor of the old earls of Lennox of whom we are now to give an account  The first of them we can fix upon with any certainty is  AYKFRITH or EGFRITH an English Saxon lord who was possessed of a great estate in Northumberland  Ordericus Vitali    which with Cumberland and Westmorland belonged to the Scots for several generations it is therefore probable that he was of Scotch extract He had also the lordships of Dent and Sadbergh  Thore  by ducatus Loidiensi  p  in Yorkshire and was cotemporary with the kings Canute and Edward the Confessor  He made a great addition to his paternal estate by the marriage of Ecksrida a rich Yorkshire heiress  Doomsday book in registro honoris de Richmond  with whom he got vast possessions  viz  the lands and baronies of Askrig Holteby Marrig Burgh Ilkton Newton Taulield Wath Melmorby Normanby with several others all in the same county  He died about the year and left issue a son  II ARKYLL or ARKILL who succeeded him  Ibidem  and in old records is designed Arkill chevalier the son of Egfrith  c  He was possessor not only of all the above baronies in Yorkshire but also of the lands of Hakeford  Ibidem  Hornebye Layburn Brumpton Carthorp  c  in the same county  He had likeways a great estate in Northumberland which appears from a cotemporary author who mentions him as one of the most powerful men in that country  Ordericus Vitalis ad ann Histor Normann scriptores p  according to these remarkable words  "  Arkyllus Nordankymbrorum potentissimus cum rege concordiam fecit eique filium suum obsidem tradidit c  "  He married Sigrida daughter to a powerful baron in Yorkshire  viz Kilvert filius Ligulfi  by Ekfrida his wife daughter of Aldunus bishop of Durham by which it appears  Simon Dunelmensis p  that the celibacy of the clergy had not then obtained in England By her he had a son  Cospatrick  who marrying the daughter of Dolphin the son of Torphin had a son Cospatrick cotemporary with Simon of Durham a descendant of which Cospatrick  Doomsday book appendix p  by an heirfemale was Adam de Steavolay who succeeded to his Yorkshire estate  Arkyll being a great sticklet for the old Saxon race bore a principal share in all the insurrections against William the Conqueror and being defeated by him  anno  was obliged to give his son Cospatrick an hostage for his fidelity who being too young to have been concerned in his father's conspiracies  Ibidem  got a good share of his Yorkshire estate  Another dangerous insurrection having been raised against the Conqueror by the Northern counties in the year Arkyll joined heartily in it and being again defeated was forfeited and obliged to leave England  Ordericus Vitalis p etSimon Dunelmensis p  according to these words of the said author  "  Eodem tamen anno Arkyllus fuit inter rebelles Eboracenses quibus profligatis a conquestore in exilium actus est c  "  Arkyll fled to Scotland to king Malcolm C  nmore who having married Margaret sister to Edgar Atheling the true and lineal heir of the English crown received all the Saxon exiles with open arms gave them estates in Scotland and other rewards suitable  to their birth merit and the losses they had sustained in England on account of their loyalty  Arkyll obtained from that king a large tract of land in the shires of Dunbarton and Stirling which was afterwards erected into the earldom of Lennox in favours of Alwin Mac Arkyll his grandson  From this Arkyll his descendents the old earls of Lennox are denominated by the Gaelic bards and senachies  Siol Arkyll i e  the posterity of Arkyll  It is said he

Saxon or Alwin according to the Celtic who succeeded him and is always designed MacArkill or the son of Arkill  We find him mentioned in our records in the beginning of the reign of king David I who succeeded to the crown of Scotland  anno    He is witness to a charter of confirmation by that monarch to the abbacy of Dunfermline  Chartulary of Dunfermline  together with Constantine earl of Fise

lands of MaybothleBeg or Little Maybole in Airshire in but we know nothing of his posterity unless Dovenald Lefitz Michae More de Levenax mentioned in Prynne's collections  anno  is descended of him  Though we cannot fix upon the precise time of this earl's death yet we are sure it happened in the reign of king Malcolm who died  anno    The earl was succeeded in his whole estates and dignities in Scotland by his eldest son  V ALUIN second earl of Lennox who being very young at his father's death king William who succeeded king Malcolm as superior of the earldom of Lennox gave the ward thereof during earl Alwin's minority to his own brother David earl of Huntington and Garioch which appears from an inquisition taken by the abbot and convent of Paisley concerning the lands of MonachKenneran now supposed to be Balchonran  Chartulary of Paisley p  upon the river Clyde  anno  when several of the witnesses declare that the above lands belonged to the monastery at the time that David earl of Huntington held and possessed the earldom of Lennox according to these words in the chartulary of Paisley  "  Eo tempore quo David comes frater regis Willielmi habuit et possedit comitatum de Levenax

Ibidem and chartulary of Glasgow  to which Malcolm his son and apparent heir was a witness d March  He made also considerable donations to the religious at Arbroath and several other places  Chartulary of Arbroath c  which is a sufficient proof of his great piety and the largeness of the estate he was possessed of  Nor was his loyalty and regard for his sovereign less remarkable so  understanding that king Alexander II had a great inclination to have into his own possession the castle of Dunbarton a place very strong both by nature and art and then the principal messuage of the earldom of Lennox also a large extent of territory called Morach with its harbour and fishing contiguous thereto The earl immediately made a surrender of the whole earldom into the king's hands and thereupon obtained a new charter dated in in which neither the castle nor territory were contained according to these remarkable words in the charter  Chartulary of Lennox  quae  says the king  ex consensu et bona voluntate ipsius Maldovini comitis in manu nostra retinuimus c  The castle has ever since continued a royal  fort and the town of Dunbarton was immediately erected by the king on the

predecessors  He was one of the Scotch nobles who signed that famous letter to the pope  Fordun vol II p  asserting the independency of Scotland  anno    He got also from that same prince a charter under the great seal  dilecto et fideli suo Malcolmo comiti de Levenax  of the lands of Lecky lying near Buchanan in recompence of some lands in the territory of Cardross which the earl had yielded to

third lord high steward of Scotland and this seems to be in some measure confirmed by a charter of Alan of Faslane to which his seal was appended having thereon a fess cheque of three tracts  Writs of A  dincaple  with some other mark of distinction But be this as it will it is certain that Walter of Faslane soon after his marriage with Margaret the heiress relinquished his own paternal coat and assumed the armorial bearing of this family and his posterity took on the sirname of Lennox whereof the eldest son was to get the estate of Lennox which came by his mother and his second was to get his own paternal estate of Faslane  c  He was at last designed  dominus de Lennox  which appears by a charter  Waltero de Faslane domino de Lennox et haeredibus suis comitibus de Lennox c anno

declining to accept a dignity which he thought he had not estate sufficient to support king Robert II out of a grateful remembrance of the many and eminent services performed to the kings his predecessors by the family of Lennox conferred  de novo  Ibidem  upon the said sir Duncan and his heirs the dignity of earl of Lennox after it had lain dormant for the space of eight or ten years ever since the death of earl Donald in  There are a great many charters still extant relating to Duncan earl of Lennox but by none of them can we discover into what family he married  Chartularies of Lennox Pasley c  only we are sure he had three daughters    Isabel    Margaret    Elizabeth  of whom more particularly hereafter  The earl entered into an indenture with Robert earl of Fise and Men

c  The above mentioned heirs portioners had a long contest amongst themselves concerning the division and succession to the earldom of Lennox which was at last determined in favours of the family of D  nly  anno  whereby that earldom came to the Stewarts and in consequnence of the above descent the Stewarts of Darnly and Haldanes of Gleneagles quarter the arms of Lennox with their own but the Napiers of Merchiston have ever since assumed the arms of Lennox in place of the old bearing of the Napiers  By the preceeding narration it appears  Nisbet vol I p  that the earldom of Lennox according to the above mentioned entail went in a regular course of succession to the lawful heirs of line of that antient family which is fully instructed by the above indisputable documents and if earl Duncan had had a son lawfully born he would have had a just and undoubted right to both the estate and title of earl of Lennox in which case the female succession could never have taken place

military genius went abroad to push his fortune in the foreign wars where he had the opportunity of signalizing his courage and conduct so often  Ibid and Nisbet vol I p  that he justly acquired the reputation of a man of great knowledge in the military art  He first served a volunteer in lord Vere's regiment in Holland where he soon rose to the degree of a captain  He then went to Sweden and entered into the service of Gustavus Adolphus and performed such heroic actions under that great monarch that he raised him to the rank of a lieutenantgeneral then to that of velt marshal of his armies  In when the town of Stralsund was besieged by a victorious army under the command of Count Walsten and reduced almost to the last extremity the king of Sweden sent general Lesly to take upon him the command of the garrison where he behaved with such singular resolution and conduct that he obliged the Count to raise the siege The burghers were so sensible of the great service he had done them that they made him considerable presents and struck several medals in honour of him upon that occasion some whereof are still preserved in the family  In he drove the Imperialists intirely out of Rugen and continued in the Swedish service with great glory and renown till the troubles broke out in his own country that he returned home  He immediately laid out some of his money upon lands in the north country  Chart in pub archiv  and got charters under the great seal  domino Alexandro Lesly militi et Gustavo Lesly filio suo  of the lands of Auchintoul  c inter    et    In he was invited by

of the Scotch army and defeated a party of the king's troops under the command of lord Conway at Newburn and took possession of Newcastle  His behaviour and conduct is approved by parliament and he got an order for merks  Minutes of parliament and rescinded acts  to be paid out of the first and readiest of the public money for his good and faithful services  c  Immediately thereafter there was a treaty set on soot with the king at Rippon general Leslie being one of the parliament's commissioners at the conclusion of which the king was so well pleased with the general's behaviour that he first created him lord Balgony  Charta penes comitem de Leven  then raised him to the dignity of earl of Leven by patent to his heirs whatsomever  anno    He got a charter under the great seal  Alexandro

Rescinded acts of parlt  anno  one of the supernumeraries of the committee  anno  and got a new commission to be lord general  anno    He was one of the planters of kirks and had a considerable pension settled on him besides l  per  month for the payment of his troops  Ibidem  including trumpeters kettle drums  c anno    Notwithstanding what is above observed his afterbehaviour would induce one to believe that his real principles were rather loyal than otherways and that had he imagined the parliament would have driven matters to such extremities he would not have been so hearty in their interest yet a reverend author says  Guthry's memoirs  that he was one of the peers that sat in the parliament in January and did nothing to hinder the king's murder  However none appeared more forward than the earl of Leven afterwards for raising an army and restoring king Charles II  He served as a volunteer against Oliver Cromwell at the battle of Dunbar and heartily joined and concurred with the loyalists in every measure for reestablishing our old constitution in church and state but when he with others of the loyal party had a meeting in Angus to concert matters for their future conduct general Monk who then besieged Dundee having got intelligence of their meeting sent a strong party in the night surprised and took them all prisoners at Alyth in Angus and sent the old general with several others prisoners to London where they were confined in the tower  And though he had been long a faithful servant to the parliament yet he did not meet with the least favour from Oliver Cromwell on that account but suffered sequestration and many other hardships till at last by the mediation of the queen of Sweden he obtained his liberty and was so sensible of the service her majesty had done him that he went over to Sweden in person to make his acknowledgments where he was received and entertained with great respect according to his quality and former services  He at last

and of this work where that succession is fully narrated  KER Marquis of LOTHIAN  THAT the noble and illustrious name of Ker is of very great antiquity in Scotland appears from many authentic documents  Some deduce them from a noble family of that sirname in France one whereof came over to England with William the Conqueror had a considerable command in his army and afterwards settled in England in confirmation of which they alledge that baron Ker and several other families of that sirname now subsisting in France trace their origin even higher than that aera  Others are of opinion that Ker is a local sirname and was first assumed by the possessors of the lands and baronies of Ker and Kershall in Lancashire where several families of that name have made a considerable figure for many ages past But it must be observed that the Kers in England and France have the very same armorial bearings so whether they came from France to England or from England  to France we shall not pretend to determine  Sir George MacKenzie that learned and judicious antiquary is of opinion that the Kers first settled in the south parts of Scotland about the year but it is most certain they were a numerous and flourishing family in this country long before that time for we find many of that sirname swearing fealty to king Edward I of England betwixt the years and for lands lying in different parts of the kingdom  Henricus Ker swore fealty in  Prynne's collect vol III p  Nicol Ker ditto Prynne ibid page  Andrew del Ker ibid page  Willielmus Ker who swore fealty for lands in Airshire  anno    Remarks on Ragman's roll p  and is said to be ancestor of the Kers of Kersland  Thomas Ker  Ibid p  miles c  Sir George MacKenzie mentions two brothers of that sirname who settled in the south parts of Scotland  viz  Ralph and Robert Kers but whether they came from England or France or were sons of any of the abovenamed Kers he does not determine but thinks that Ralph ancestor of the Kers of Fernyhirst was the eldest brother because that family carried the same arms with the Kers in England and France without any difference either of tincture or charge We shall therefore follow that great author and deduce their descent according to his account  I RALPH KER who settled in Teviotdale about the year got possession of the lands lying betwixt the water of Jed and the lands of Straseburgh

sirname of Fraser yield to none in Scotland for antiquity and all our historians agree that they are of French extraction  In the M S history of the family it is said that one Julius de Berry a French gentleman of rank who lived near Bourbon made a great entertainment at his house for the king of France as he passed that way that amongst other delicacies there were fine strawberries fully ripened before the ordinary time wherewith the king was so well pleased that he assigned him strawberry leaves for his arms which in the French language are called Frases or Frasiers from which he assumed Fraser for his sirname and certain it is the Frasers continue to carry strawberry leaves or frases for their armorial bearing to this day  The time of their first settling in this country is uncertain  M  Kenzie's ess  y  Mr M  tin's collections c  Some authors say that a nobleman of France called Pierre Frasier came to Scotland in the reign of king Achaius about the year that of him was descended

Bancho thane of Lochaber paternal ancestor of the royal family of Stewart  The Frasers were undoubtedly settled and had considerable possessions in lands in the South of Scotland soon after the death of king Malcolm Canmore which is sufficiently instructed by their donations to the religious  Gilbert de Fraser is witness to the foundation charter of the monastery of Coldstream  Chartul of

and performed many great and glorious actions in defence of the liberties of his country  He was lieutenantgeneral of the Scotch forces when sir John Cummin of Badenach was guardian of the kingdom and it is well known how these two with scarce Scots defeated three English armies in one day each of them of equal if not superior numbers to themselves  Abercrombie vol I p  near Roslin  anno  and Dr Abercrombie attributes the glory gained by the Scots on that day chiefly to the remarkable courage and conduct of sir Simon  As it is inconsistent with the brevity of this work to enumerate all the glorious actions of this great man we shall only add that he was at last taken prisoner and sent to London where king Edward most cruelly put him to death he leaving issue only two daughters the one married to the ancestor of the marquis of Tweeddale  MacKenzie Nisbet c  and the other to the predecessor of the family of Wigton In consequence of which marriages these two families have continued to

glorious victory over Haco king of Norway who had invaded Scotland with a great army  anno    The year thereafter the earl of March with the lord high steward reduced the Isle of Man with all the Ae

daughter of Thomas Randolph  Crawfurd's p  ge p  earl of Murray sister and at length sole heiress of John earl of Murray whereby he was afterwards designed earl of Murray which appears by a charter of

 And dying  anno  was succeeded by his eldest son  XIV GEORGE eleventh earl of March designed also earl of Murray and lord of Annandale in right of his mother was certainly one of the most powerful men of his time and continued a dutiful and loyal subject during all the reign of king Robert II  He was warden of the marches and was very successful in repressing the insolences of the English borderers  In he was one of the commissioners appointed to treat of a peace with England  Rymer  which ended only in a truce  In he joined the earl of Douglas and they burnt the town of Roxburgh took the castle of Lochmaben defeated the English who had invaded the South borders and took a rich convoy that followed their army  After all these services he revolted to the English for which our historians give the following reason    The earl's daughter lady Elizabeth Dunbar was contracted to David prince of Scotland the king's eldest son and it is said the earl had actually paid a considerable sum to the king in part of his daughter's portion  The earl of Douglas being then the greatest man in the kingdom proposed to the king to marry the prince to his daughter lady Marjory Douglas which accordingly was accomplished notwithstanding the former contract  The earl of March being a man of a great  pirit highly resented this affront turned an enemy to his country and determined to do it all the mischief in his power  He committed the care of his castle of Dunbar to his nephew sir Robert Maitland of Leithington renounced his allegiance to his lawful sovereign  Ibidem  withdrew to England with a considerable retinue of his friends and followers was well received by king Henry who gave him possession of several lands and settled an annuity of merks sterling upon him became a liege man to the king of England and did him many signal services against his native country  He entered into a strict friendship with sir Henry Piercy and other English borderers the constant enemies of the Scotch nation and with them invaded Scotland with a considerable force made great havock and destroyall with fire and sword wherever he came for which he was most justly outlawed and forfeited and being one of the best generals of his time the English gained several advantages over the Scots under his conduct particularly at Homildon in and at the battle of Shrewsbury in where the victory was chiefly ascribed to the earl of March's military skill  After all he became weary of distressing his native country and made application to Robert duke of Albany governor of Scotland for a pardon who gave him a favourable answer upon which he came to Scotland and was restored to all his estates and honours by the governor  anno  and lived peaceably in his own country all the remainder of his days  He married Christian daughter of sir William Seton of that ilk ancestor of the earls of Winton by whom he had six sons and one daughter    George  his heir    John  earl of Murray  Sir  Gavin Dunbar  Fordun vol II p  a brave soldier    Colin Dunbar  Sir  Patrick Dunbar  of Beill who was murdered with king J  mes I  Ibidem  anno  This sir Patrick left a son Hugh who sold his lands of Beill  Chart in pub archiv ad annum  c  in East Lothian and the mill of Mersington in Berwickshire to Robert Lauder of Edrington th September All these four brothers are mentioned in a charter in our public records  Ibid ad ann charter in MacFarlane's book of orinal writes p    David Dunbar  of Cockburn whose only daughter and heiress Mariota married Alexander earl of Crawfurd  His daughter lady  Janet  married st to John lord Seton and dly to sir Adam Johnston of that ilk  The earl died in and was succeeded by his eldest son  XV GEORGE twelfth earl of March who was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the English about the redemption of king James I  Rymer  anno  which was happily accomplished the year thereafter and the earl had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him at the solemnity of the king's coronation  Though it does not appear that this earl was ever guilty of any bad practices against the state yet the ravages and devastations committed by his father against his country during his rebellion made many good subjects enemies to his family They endeavoured to prepossess the king against him and to convince him that it was not in the power of a governor to restore to his estate and fully to pardon so great and formidable a rebel as his father was who had been justly outlawed and forfeited by the Iaws of the land  The earl was apprehended and committed prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh but the king would suffer nothing to be done against him contrary to law he therefore called a parliament to meet at Perth in order for his trial on th January  The earl pled that his father had been fully pardoned by the duke of Albany then governor of Scotland and that he had never been guilty of any crime against the state  The advocates for the king replied that the power of restoring rebels and exiles was lodged in the king alone and never in the person of a governor  At last after long debate the parliament passed sentence against him in these words  "  Quod ratione forisfacturae domini Georgii de Dunbar  Records of parliament  quondam comitis Marchiae et domini de Dunbar omne jus tam proprietatis quam

till king James III conferred it upon his unnatural brother Alexander duke of Albany  anno    Yet such was the king's goodness and bounty to this earl that he bestowed upon him a pension out of the earldom of Buchan then in the crown which supported him according to his quality during his life  We have not been able to discover to whom this earl was married but it is certain he left issue a son

after his father's sentence  anno    Fordun vo  II p ▪  which was no inconsiderable sum in those days and sufficiently shows the king's lenity and goodwill towards the family  It appears also that the parliament only forfeited his lands that held of the king for we find that this Patrick and his heirs possessed the lands and barony of Kilconquhar in Fife which was the undoubted property of the earls of March but they held these lands of the bishop of St Andrews who granted a new charter  Book of original charter belonging to MacFarlane  Patricio Dunbar filio et haeredi quondam Georgii

forfeiture of the earl of March in that earldom remained in the crown till king James III bestowed it upon his brother Alexander duke of Albany  anno  but he being also forfeited for rebellion that title was again annexed to the crown where it continued till king James VI conferred it upon  Robert Stewart second son of John earl of Lennox by lady Anne Stewart his wife daughter of John earl of Athole  This Robert was bred to the church and  when a young man was made provost of the collegiate church of Dunbarton  Keith's bishops p  and elected bishop of the see of Caithness  anno  but he having taken part with his brother the earl of Lennox against the earl of Arran the governor of the kingdom he incurred the same forfeiture with his brother was obliged to abscond  Ibidem  then went abroad where he continued for the space of twentytwo years  Upon his return home he became protestant but enjoyed the revenue and title of bishop of Caithness as long as he lived tho' he never was in priest's orders  After the death of the regent Murray and the accession of his brother the earl of Lennox to that supreme office  Ibidem  he got a gift of the revenue of the priory of St Andrews which he also retained all his life  In the year the honours of earl of Lennox devolved upon him by the death of his nephew Charles but as he had no lawful issue of his own body he resigned that earldom in favours of his grand nephew Esme Stewart lord d'Aubigny and in lieu thereof he had the title of March conferred upon him  Chart in pub archiv  and got a charter under the great seal  Roberto Stewart

Tweed at Redbraes in the county of Berwick and in Greenstreet Grosvenorsquare London  KEITH Earl MARISHAL  HISTORY and remotest antiquity are agreed that the family of Keith is one of the most ancient and illustrious the Scotch nation ever has produced a family fruitful in a race of great men who not indebted to the nobility of their origin have always reflected greater glory on their progenitors on the hereditary titles and offices they enjoyed than they ever deduced from them  Our best antiquaries derive their origin from a certain great man called Robert who performed glorious exploits against the Danes when they invaded Scotland with a numerous army in the reign of king Malcolm II  Cambden Abercrombie vol p Stewart's hist of the royal family and many other authors  tho' some trace their origin much higher however this hero remarkaby distinguished himself at the battle of Barry or Camustone in Angus where with his own hand he killed the famous Camus general and champion of the Danish army whereby the Scots gained a compleat victory  anno    King Malcolm in recompence of his great and signal services bestowed upon him several lands particularly the barony of Keith in EastLothian from which his posterity assumed their sirname He also appointed him hereditary great marishal of Scotland which high office hath continued in his family and hath never been enjoyed by any other since that time  Of this great warrior was lineally descended Herveus or Hervieus de Keth of whom we have many authentic documents in the archives of the kingdom which sufficiently prove that he was great marishal of Scotland and proprietor of the lands and barony of Keth and as he was undoubted progenitor of this illustrious family from him we deduce their descent by unquestionable vouchers  I HERVEUS de KETH great marishal of Scotland flourished in the reign of king David I who succeeded to the crown  anno  and died  anno    This Herveus had a dispute with the abbot and convent of Kelso  Chartulary of Kelso penes MacFarlane p  who claimed the church of Keth in the village of this Herveus designed  Herveus de Keth marescallus regis Scotiae  at a convention held on that cause to which J bishop of Glasgow and R abbot of Jedworth are witnesses  inter annos    et  in which last year the bishop died  That there had been many meetings and conventions about this contest sufficiently appears from the writs in the chartulary of Kelso  At last the pope interposed his authority and Joceline bishop of Glasgow and Osbert prior of Paisley were delegated by him as judges of the plea  Ibid p  which had long sublisted between the monks of Kelchou and Herveus great marishal about the church of Keth in the village of the said Herveus  c  Their sentence in favours of the monastery was confirmed by Richard bishop of St Andrews who died  anno    Ibid p  and Joceline having been constituted bishop of Glasgow  anno    Ibidem  the controversy must have been determined between these two periods  It may here be observed that of old there were two Keiths that which belonged to this family was promiscuously called KeithHervey  Ibid p Chart in pub archiv  and KeithMarishal the other which sometime belonged to the Frasers was called KeithSymons or KeithHundely now Humby but the great marishals soon became proprietors of both as will be shown hereafter  Herveus de Keth lived to a great age died betwixt the years and and was father of  II MALCOLMUS de KETH who in a donation to the monastery of Arbroath  Chartulary of Arbroath penes MacFarlane p  is designed son of Herveus de Keth great marishal of Scotland  anno    And in a donation to the monastery of Kelso  Chartulary of Kelso p and  concerning the teinds of the miln of of Molla Malcolm son of Herveus de Keth great marishal of Scotland is a witness  anno    He is also mentioned in another donation to the same monastery  Ibid p  together with Robert de Ednem Thomas de Heriz  c  before the year  This Malcolm appears to have died before his father for we never find him designed great marishal He left issue two sons    Philip de Keth    David de Keth  who enjoyed a share of the marishal's office with his brother  Chartulary of Arbroath and Cambuskenneth and Dalrymple's collections  as in several donations to the monasteries of Arbroath and Cambu  kenneth we find Philip and David de Keth designed brothers and great marishals of our lord the king between the years and This David had a son Richard  Origin writs penes MacFarlane vol II p c ad ann  and  who is said to have been progenitor of those who assumed Marishal for their sirname of whom there were several families in Scotland afterwards but some historians have most erroncously taken them for great marishals of Scotland tho' it is most certain that that office was never enjoyed by any family but the Keiths as before observed  III PHILIP de KETH great marishal of Scotland eldest son of Malcolm succeeded his grandfather  Chartulary o

other lands in his ground of Keth all contained in one charter which is without date  Ibid p  but by the witnesses appears to have been about the year  He also confirms a donation to the monastery of

which dignity was afterwards succeeded by that of earl but as most of the accounts of the origin and descent of our great families before the reign of king Malcolm III are only traditional and sometimes sabulous we shall begin the memoirs of this illustrious family from the reign of that king since which aera the uninter  ed possession of it down to the present time is clearly documented by our histories and records  All our historians agree that king Malcolm III called Canmore held a  con  entus procerum  or parliament at Forsar in the beginning of his reign by some authors said to be in and by others in at which general meeting Malcolm created some of the chiefs of his nobility earls by the titles they formerly enjoyed  Thanes amongst whom was Martacns Thane afterwards earl of

lord Erskine as above deduced  We shall only here observe before we proceed to the history of the family of Erskine that though the earls of Marr as far back as we have any records were amongst the greatest and most illustrious families in the kingdom yet we find few or none of their descendents who assumed Marr for their sirname  Nicol de Marr is witness in a charter of king Malcolm IV to the

ERSKINE Earl of MARR  ALL our antiquaries agree that this noble family is of very great antiquity but the history of its origin like that of most other antient families is chiefly founded on tradition  Some authors deduce their descent from a noble Florentine who is said to have come to Scotland in the reign of king Kenneth II  It is said by others that in the reign of king Malcolm II a Scotsman of high distinction having killed with his own hand Enrique one of the Danish generals at the battle of Murthill cut off his head and with the bloody dagger in his hand shewed it to the king and in the Gaelic said Erisskyne alluding to the head and dagger and in the same language also said I intend to perform greater actions than what I have done  c  whereupon king Malcolm imposed upon him the sirname of Erskyne and assigned him for his armorial bearing a hand holding a dagger with  je pense plus  for a motto which hath continued to be the crest and motto of this noble family ever since  But we shall insist no further on these traditional accounts and shall here only observe that it is most certain that this family had vast possessions in the shires of Renfrew and Air in very early times particularly the lands barony and castle of Erskine a beautiful seat upon the banks of the river Clyde Whether the Erskines gave their name to their lands or took it from them we shall not pretend to determine but certain it is there is no account either from records or tradition of any persons being possessed of the lands of Erskine before them  The first of the family we can mention

never entirely in peaceable possession of that earldom for king James II's council got an act passed in his first parliament declaring that whatsoever lands his majesty's father died possessed of or had claimed  Ibidem  should remain with the king during his minority  By an indenture betwixt the king's council and Robert lord Erskine calling himself earl of Marr it was agreed for the guid and quiet of the land that the king shall deliver up to lord Erskine the castle of Kildrimmie to be kept by him till the king's majority which done the said lord shall come before the king and three estates and show his rights and claims as far as law will And further it is accordit that half the revenues belonging to the earldom of Marr shall remain with the said lord till the ending of the plea and that whenever the said lord shall receive the castle of Kildrimmie he shall deliver up not only the castle of Marr but  likeways the castle of Dumbarton  Writs of the fam of Marr  dated th August  There is a protest taken by said lord Erskine in the hands of Richard Cadie notar in the presence of the king and council in Stirling castle th August complaining upon the chancellor for refusing to retour him to the lordship of Garrioch and put him in possession of the castle of Kildrimmie protesting that he might and should be free to intromit at his own hand with the haill lands of Marr and Garrioch  c  And accordingly he immediately after besieged and took the castle of Kildrimmie whereupon the king seized the castle of Alloa  Ibidem  For the recovery of which there was an indenture entered into between the king and council on the one part and lord Erskine on the other by which lord Erskine oblige  himself to deliver up the castle of Kildrimmie betwixt and the third July next to any the king should appoint to be kept by them till the king's majority and then to be delivered up to either of them who should be found to have right to it at the sight of the three estates and to account to the king at his majority for the one half of the earldom of Marr And the king and council on their part obliged themselves  hat so soon as the castle of Kildrimmie should be delivered up to th  se appointed by the king his majesty should deliver up to lord Erskine his castle of Alloa and all the furniture and warlike stores found therein This indenture is sealed by the king's privy seal and the seals of William bishop of Glasgow and of James of Livingston then keepers of the king's person and the lords of Graeme and Gray bind themselves as cautioners for the king and council's fulfilling their part of the indentures and on the part of lord Erskine his seal and the seal of his son and heir sir Thomas Erskine is affixed And sir Henry Douglas of Lochleven Thomas of Wemyss and William Auchterlony of Kelly bind themselves as cautioners for the father and son's performing their part of the indentures which bears date the th June  Ibidem  On the th September sir Thoma  Erskine appeared in parliament as procurator for his father and took instruments in the hands of John Anthrie notar that lord Erskine was ready to fulfil the terms of the above indenture and that his right should not be prejudised by lapse of time  Ibidem  he being willing to submit all questions to be determined by a full and free parliament suspected persons burgesses being removed  There are many other protests taken by Robert lord Erskine and his son sir Thomas betwixt this time and the year but as they are all to the same purpose with the last mentioned one  Ibidem  it is unnecessary to insert more of them here  At last in the year the king brought a reduction against sir Thomas now lord Erskine his father being then dead of his father lord Erskine's service  Ibidem  abovementioned to Isabel countess of Marr  The heads of the reduction are  st  That lord Erskine ought not to have been served heir  In pub archiv  because there were no witnesses who could swear to his being come of Elyne of Marr who was long since dead    dly  Because the said service was contrary to the act of parliament anent the king's keeping possession of all lands or rights his majesty's father was in possession of or had claimed at the time of his decease    dly  Because Isabel countess of Marr was not the person who died last vested and fa  sed in that earldom but Alexander Stewart and Thomas his natural son to both whom the king was heir    thly  Because the king himself was nearest heir to Isabel countess of Marr as being descended from Isabel of Marr king Robert Bruce's first queen mother of princess Marjory and Isabel of Marr being eldest daughter of Gratney earl of Marr ought to be preferred to the descendents of Elyne her second sister in the earldom of Marr which was an indivisable subject  Upon these grounds an assize of error met at Aberdeen where the king himself was present and they by their verdict dated th May reduced the service of Robert lord Erskine and sound that the king only had right to the earldom of Marr lordship of Garrioch  c  This reduction was confirmed in parliament  Records of parliament  th November  But against all these proceedings Thomas lord Erskine entered his protest and he and his posterity always continued to assert their right to the earldom of Marr and to complain of the violence with which they said it was wrested from them  At last in the reign of queen Mary John then lord Erskine obtained leave to have this question tried anew and to have it determined by an inquest whether he was nearest heir to Isabel countess of Marr or not And lord Erskine having laid before the inquest the proofs of his propinquity as above deduced and shown that there was nothing in the four reasons of reduction at the instance of the king    st  Because it never was before heard of or pretended that the proof of propinquity to one's ancestors by undoubted records was  not as valid as that by witnesses which in many cases by lapse of time was rendered impossible That if this was to be established as a rule the king would be found to have right to one half of the lands of Scotland as well as to the earldom of Marr  That as to the  second  reason the act of parliament anent the king's keeping possession during his minority that could be no reason for reducing the service of Robert lord Erskine to Isabel countess of Marr but only for not giving him possession till the king's majority  That as to the  third  reason that Isabel countess of Marr did not die last vested and saised but earl Alexander her husband and Thomas his natural son it was of no weight because that Alexander was only saised of that estate in right of liferent failing issue of the marriage as appeared by the charter of the said countess Isabel and earl Alexander dated th December  And which is confirmed by king Robert's charter of confirmation st January by which it undeniably appears that the charter of resignation by Isabel countess of Marr th August was altered both by the parties concerned and their sovereign lord the king and therefore the resignation and charter that followed thereon th May in favours of the said Alexander and Thomas his natural son who died before him without issue was null and void  That as to the  fourth  reason that Isabel of Marr queen to Robert Bruce was daughter to Gratney earl of Marr and eldest sister to Elyne who married sir John Menteith that it was well known that Isabel of Marr queen to Robert Bruce was sister to Gratney earl of Marr▪ and not his daughter but daughter to  earl of Marr his father which was fully proved by Gratney earl of Marr being always stiled in king Robert's charters his brother but never his father  The inquest accordingly met and found by their retour dated th May that he was the nearest heir to Robert earl of Marr and  lord Erskine  c  which Robert was  heir to Isabel countess of Marr and to Gratney earl of Marr her great grandfather  And in he was restored to the earldom of Marr  per u  dum justitiae  which was ratified in parliament th June  He obtained a charter under the great seal as heir to lady Isabel countess of Marr of the whole estate and earldom of Marr comprehending Strathdon Braemarr Cromarr St  athd  e and lordship of Garrioch  c  d June  And there is an instrument of sasine dated the th of July thereafter  The lands abovementioned having been all

VI succeeded to the crown of England He discharged his duty in that high and difficult trust of the guardianship of his young sovereign with the greatest fidelity and prudence  All our historians  and though this noble lord was one of those that inclined to the reformation then beginning in Scotland yet he always steadily and vigorously opposed the practices of the court of England which he thought inconsistent with the honour and independency of his country and showed himself equally incapable of being moved by English gold or the threatenings of a party Queen Mary remained in his keeping till the year when the estates of the kingdom to avoid the practices of the court of England and of the faction in Scotland that had joined with them thought proper to order him to carry the queen to the court of France  Ibidem  there to be educated under the eye and care of Francis I which he accordingly did and delivered her safe into the hands of that monarch and immediately returned home  By many

transaction of importance in this country from his father's death till his own yet he conducted himself so in those factious unquiet times that he is allowed by the historians of both sides to have been a steady friend to his country and a man of as unspotted a character as any person then upon the stage  Being born a younger brother he was educated for the church and was when very young  Keith's bishops  by king James V appointed commendator of Cambuskenneth and Inchmahomo in Perthshire  Immediately after his father's death he was appointed governor of the castle of Edinburgh  In archiv familiae de Marr  which to the satisfaction of the nation he nobly kept against all foreigners both French and English Immediately upon queen Mary's return from France  anno  he was nominated one of her privy council and got from her several grants of church lands at that time newly dissolved  He then likeways as has been beforementioned renewed his claim to the earldom of Marr and obtained liberty to have that cause reheard and his right being clearly and distinctly proven he was restored  per modum justitiae  to the earldom of Mair lordship of Garrioch  c anno  The same was afterwards ratified and confirmed by parliament th June as before observed He took his seat accordingly as earl of Marr  Rolls of parliament  and he and his successors have always since protested that they ought to be called as the first earl  There is a charter from queen Mary and king Henry  In archiv  Marr  to John earl of Marr th July narrating that the family of Erskine of long and bygone times had the custody and  keeping of the principal forts and places of strength in the kingdom and had always discharged their trust faithfully and stoutly and their majesties being desirous to keep noble antient and untainted families in their native lands rights and possessions and to make them secure of the same and particularly considering that John earl of Marr and his predecessors had for a long time bygone been keepers of the castle of Stirling and sheriffs of the shire thereof therefore they gave and granted heretably and irredeemably to the said earl of Marr and his heirs bearing the arms and sirname of Erskine the office of sheriff of Stirlingshire or the prefecture or captainship and custody of the castle of Stirling with the park garden  c c  Ibidem  together with the office of bailiary and chamberlainry of the lands and lordship of Stirling and of the water of Forth  c  In the year how soon king James VI was born the care and keeping of him was committed to the earl of Marr which great trust he faithfully discharged and with great prudence and firmness took all imaginable care of his royal education and to protect his sacred person from the violence and snares of the two contending parties who left no means whatsoever untried of getting him into their hands  Melvil's memoirs and all our historians  For this reason he removed the king from Edinburgh to Stirling where he was governor and had the sole command Although he always behaved with the utmost submission to the queen and had the greatest regard for her majesty yet the unhappy situation of his country at that time forced him to concur with those who set the crown on the prince's head  anno  And as he appears not to have been satisfied with the intentions of either of the parties nor with their method of pursuing them he declined being engaged on either side further than the preservation of the king's person and the liberties of his country made it absolutely necessary for him to be And altho' when the factions came to blows he generally joined and supported the party that called themselves the king's yet as he plainly showed that he thought them too much guided and influenced by the court of England it is certain they never let him into any of their secrets  When the earl of Lennox the regent was surprized and killed in the town of Stirling he by the timely assistance he brought to the king's party prevented the whole heads of it from being cut off or made prisoners and when a new regent was to be chosen the confidence that the nation in general had in the earl of Marr's integrity and moderation forced the king's party to consent to his being made regent notwithstanding all the practices used by queen Elizabeth and her ambassadors to prevent it  So soon as he was in possession of that high office he applied himself vigorously to allay as far as possible the factions which tore his country in pieces and to free it from the influence of English councils In order to these things he had accomodated matters with Kirkcaldie of Grange  Ibidem  and others who were in possession of the castle of Edinburgh and persuaded them to join and cooperate with him to bring about peace and tranquillity thing so much to be wished for but just when he was on the point of bringing these good purposes to bear he to the great misfortune of his country died a young man in November as some say not without the suspicion of poison  He married Annabella Murray daughter of lord Tullibardine by whom he had a son  John  his heirand a daughter  Lady  Margaret  married to Archibald earl of Angus  He was succeeded by his son  XIV JOHN fourteenth lord Erskine and seventh earl of Marr who was very young at the time of his father's death and was educated in the castle of Stirling along with king James VI whom the states of the kingdom after the death of lord Marr committed to the care of his widow the countess of Marr and though this earl had been educated with king James yet he in his younger days was so far seduced by some others of the nobility as to forget himself and the unblemished loyalty of his ancestors and to join with them in surprizing the king at Ruth  en  anno  for which his whole lands were justly seized and he obliged to fly the country however he soon became sensible of the crime he had committed  Chart in pub archiv et  amil de Marr  and the king was so gracious as to pardon him restore to him his whole estate and receive him again into his favour  In the year the king intrusted the keeping of his new born son and heir as usual to the earl of Marr with a strict order to him not to deliver him up to any person whatever  Ibidem  without a written mandate under his own hand and in case of his death not to deliver him to any person whatsomever neither to the queen his mother nor even to the parliament if they required it till he was eighteen years of age then he would command himself  Lord Marr was naturally a man of great abilities and being bred from his infancy in  the factious court of king James VI he became an able statesman He was the person the king chose to send to England to congratulate queen Elizabeth upon the suppression of the attempt of the earl of Essex  Melvil all our historians  And it is acknowledged he entered into some secret negotiations and measures for securing the king's succession to the crown of England He was accompanied by the abbot of Kinloss and matters were managed with such dexterity and address that most of the queen's ministers and great men of England entered into engagements unknown to her majesty and to one another to support king James's title to the crown of England  When king James went to England  anno  he carried lord Marr along with him but before he came to York lord Marr was obliged to return to Scotland to appease queen Anne who had demanded her daughter princess Elizabeth and her son prince Charles whom lord Marr had left under the care of his countess with express command not to deliver them to any person whatever without an order under his hand It is said that the queen never forgave him this  However immediately thereafter he followed the king to England and so soon as he got to London he was appointed a privy councillor of that kingdom and was enstalled one of the knights of the garter at Windsor  He continued much at court and greatly in the king's favour for the first eight or ten years after he went to England who entrusted and confided much in him with regard to the management of foreign affairs and he was said to be at the head of the French saction as it was then called  On the d of February he obtained a charter upon his own resignation of the earldom of Marr lordship of Strathdon and Strathdee of Garrioch and Alloa  c  together with the heretable offices of captainship of the castle of Stirling and sheriff of the shire thereof chamberlainry of the lordship of Stirling Menteith Br  chin and Navarre bailiary and admiralty of the

the care of he left the court and returned to Scotland where he was made lord high treasurer in which office he continued till the that he resigned it and retired to the country from all public business  It does not appear that he received from his royal master any gratuities in England but he was most bountiful to him in his grants of lands in Scotland by which and his paternal possessions he became possest of one of the greatest estates of any person in this kingdom  He married st Anne daughter of David lord Drummond by whom he had a son  John  his heir  He married dly lady Mary

and was succeeded by his son  XV JOHN fifteenth lord Erskine and eighth earl of Marr who was a man of learning and a great projector whereby he spent a considerable part of his estate  He was made one of the knights of the bath at the coronation of Henry prince of Wales  anno    He was appointed one of his majesty's privy council in Scotland one of the senators of the college of justice and governor of the castle of Edinburgh  anno    He continued a lord of session till the year  He was removed from being governor of the castle of Edinburgh  anno  and general Ruthven put in his place  In the same year king Charles having formed the design of purchasing all the heretable jurisdictions prevailed with lord Marr to enter into a minute with him obliging himself to sell to his majesty the heretable sheriffship of Stirlingshire and the bailiary of the water of Forth for the sum of eight thousand pound sterling dated at Whitehall th February And accordingly the earl resigned these two offices  Writs of the family of Marr  th November and of the same date gets a bond for the eight thousand pound  Upon the first breaking out of the great rebellion in king Charles the I's time he

lord Erskine and ninth earl of Marr who in his father's lifetime got charters under the great seal  Johanni domino Erskine totius comitatus de Marr c c  This is instructed by several charters in the public register between the years and  He was a man of great honour and merit and invariably attached to the interest of his king and country  He was much courted by the covenanters and their party to accept of a command in their army But upon his absolute refusal to have any connection with them  Guthry's memoirs p and  the command designed for him in their army together with the Stirlingshire regiment was given to lord Livingston  He having joined with the marquis of Montrose the parliament ordered his houses of Erskine and Alloa to be plundered  After the battle of Kilsyth he advertised the marquis of Montrose of general Lesly's advancing against him and warned him of the danger he was in  Guthry's memoirs  But this could not prevent the fatal battle of Philiphaugh from whence he then only lord Erskine with great difficulty made his escape to his father's estate in Marr where he raised some of the friends and vassals of his family for his majesty's service For these and his other loyal actions  Minutes of parliament  the parliament fined him in merks to be disposed of by general Lesly's advice  anno    After his father's death he had several fines imposed upon him though

About the same time he raised a regiment of foot upon his own expences for his majesty's service which has since been known by  the name of the Scotch Fuzileers and he continued colonel of this regiment till he died  The great debts his grandfather and father had been obliged to contract during the time of the grand rebellion obliged him to sell a great part of his estate and among other lands the lordship of Erskine which had never before been out of the family and which is now possest by the lord Blantyre  Although he was one of king James VII's privy councillors yet he was far from approving of the measures followed in the latter end of that reign and had actually left his house in order to retire and live privately abroad when the news of king William's landing came to Scotland  He joined the convention of estates and raised a large body of his vassals and followers in support thereof but dyed very soon thereafter  He married lady Mary Maule daughter of George earl of

knight of the most noble order of St Andrew  In the year he was made one of the principal secretaries of state for Scotland and the year following was appointed one of the commissioners for the treaty of union betwixt the two nations He joined and concurred heartily with others of the Scotch nobility who at last brought that great affair to a conclusion notwithstanding the great opposition it met with from several other Scotch lords whose spirited protests are still preserved in the records of that parliament  He was elected one of the sixteen peers for Scotland to the four first British parliaments  viz  in the years and  In the year he was appointed one of the lords of the privy council and was always in the greatest favour with his royal mistress queen Anne who was thought to confide in him more than in most men with regard to her most secret councils and affairs of state  And in the year she again appointed him one of the principal secretaries of state  Upon the accession of king George the I he was deprived of all his offices and in the year he retired to his estate in the North of Scotland where he unhappily for his country and himself raised a rebellion and proclaimed the pretender at Kirkmichael in Perthshire on the th of September that year and being joined by several of the disaffected nobility and gentry he got together about or men most of them unarmed and all undisciplined who rendesvouzed at Perth about the beginning of November from whence they marched to Sheriffmuir near Dumblane where on the th of that month being met by the king's army commanded by John duke of Argyle inferior in numbers but superior in regularity and discipline a smart engagement ensued in which a good deal of blood was shed on both sides The earl of Marr behaved like a brave officer having his horse shot under him and showing every token of spirit and gallantry but neither of the generals could claim the victory the duke retiring to Stirling and the earl to Perth however it had all the effect of a victory to the government for the earl of Marr was never after his retreat to Perth able again to bring the rebels forces together but was obliged to make his escape beyond seas and in the year was attainted of high treason along with the duke of Ormond and lord Bolingbroke and their honours and estates were forfeited to the crown  This unhappy lord after his going abroad followed the pretender to Rome and remained in his service till the year He then went to Paris and continued there till when on the account of his bad  state of health he was obliged

traditional account thereof handed down to us by our historians  Dr Abercrombie p v I c  is that they are descended of the renowned Graeme who in the year was general of king Fergus II's army and was governor of Scotland in the minority of his grandchild king Eugene II fought with the Romans defeated the Britons and in the made a breach in and forced that mighty wall which the emperor Severus had reared up between the rivers Forth and Clyde as the utmost limits of the Roman empire to keep out the Scots from molesting them in their possessions which wall has ever since retained and to this day goes under the name of Graeme's Dyke  The foundation of this great rampart has been of late traced from the one river to the other and is fully instructed by several stones found therein which have Roman inscriptions cut out upon them denoting the limits where and by whom they were set  c  A good many of these stones are at present to be seen in the college of Glasgow and are well described in Mr Gordon's  Itinerarium septentrionale  This great man is said to have married a lady of the royal house of Denmark and was progenitor of all the Grahams in the kingdom of Scotland  We shall however insist no further on these traditional accounts but directly proceed to deduce the descent of this illustrious and antient family by authentick documents from  I WILLIAM de GRAEME He flourished in the reign of king David I  Foundation charter▪ printed in the appendix to Richard Hay's vindication of Elizab More p  who succeeded to the crown of Scotland in and founded the abbacy of Holyroodhouse in

Linlithgow d January and having no maleissue the earldom of Murray went with his eldest daughter to James lord Down ancestor of the present earl of Murray who being lineally descended from Robert duke

afterwards    James  commonly called Beg ancestor of the Stewarts of Baldoran  c  It is proper here to observe that though it has been said by some authors that these sons were born before their father and mother were married consequently not lawful yet it must be owned that the subsequent marriage of their parents by the law of Scotland legitimated them to all intents and purposes But further because they were born out of the kingdom it was thought necessary to get an act of legitimation from the crown which they obtained both under the privy and great seals  "for the greater security and more evident testimony"  c  as the record bears  "to and in favours of Andrew lord Evandale  Chart in pub archiv  Arthur and Walter Stewarts his brothersgerman  c c  dated at Edinburgh th

THO' few families have made a greater figure in the annals of Scotland than that of Oliphant yet the traditional accounts of their origin are various Some alledge that when Harold king of Norway invaded Scotland with a powerful fleet and army in the reign of king Donald VI a noble Norwegian called sir Donald Oliphard was taken prisoner by the king of Scots and being a man of rank and distinction was treated according to his quality and merit A peace being afterwards concluded betwixt the two crowns sir Donald had liberty to return home but being pleased with the entertainment he met with and having contracted a friendship with several of the first quality he married and settled in this country and he is said to have been progenitor of all the Oliphants in Scotland  However we shall insist no longer on traditional accounts but proceed to deduce the descent of this most ancient and noble family by unquestionable documents from  I DAVID de HOLIFARD or OLIFARD a man of rank and figure in Scotland in the reign of king Alexander I He appears to have been much about the court of king David who upon the death of king Alexander succeeded to the crown of Scotland  anno    He was one of the Scotch barons who accompanied that prince to England when he went with an army to the assistance of Maud the empress his niece against king Stephen but  Sir James Dalrvmple's collections p  upon the raising of the siege of Wincester king David was so hotly pursued by the English army that had it not been for the valour and courage of this David de Oliphard he had been taken prisoner  anno    King David in reward of this noble action is said to have made him a grant of several lands both in the Lothians and in Perthshire but we do not find them so early mentioned in our records  In king David I's grants to the priory of Coldingham David de Olifard is a witness and his seal  Chartulary of Coldingham Nisbet vol I p  being three crescents is thereto appended which is the armorial bearing of the Oliphants to this day a convincing proof that this David was progenitor of this noble family  In the reign of the same king David there happened a dispute betwixt Robert bishop of St Andrews and G abbot of Dunfermline It was submitted to king David and his son prince Henry  Concordia fact c Chartulary of Dunfermline  and was by them accorded to the satisfaction of both parties to which David de Olifard and Herbert great chamberlain of Scotland were witnesses This deed is without date but Herbert was chamberlain from to in which space that agreement must have

Drummond has been always ranked amongst the most ancient and illustrious names of the Scotch nation highly distinguished by a long train of worthy ancestors no less remarkable for the noble alliances they made and the dignities conferred upon them than for personal merit  They have the honour to be several times sprung from the royal house of Stewart and can boast what few subjects can do  Strathallan Lesly Van Bassan sir G MacKenzie Hathornden Bayle Mar  n c c  That most of the crowned heads in Europe are descended from them as will clearly appear by the following memoirs  The traditional account of their origin handed down to us by several good historians is  I That an Hungarian gentleman named MAURICIUS or MAURICE a son of George a younger son of Andrew king of Hungary had the command of the ship in which Edgar Atheline the rightful heir to the English crown his mother Agatha and his sisters the princesses Margaret and Christian were embarked in their return from England to Hungary They were overtaken by a storm driven on the coast of Scotland and landed in the frith of Forth at a place which to this day retains the name of St Margaret's Hope so called after princess Margaret who became queen to king Malcolm III called Canmore and is well known by the name of St Margaret  This Maurice being a man of parts and merit was highly esteemed by king Malcolm who to induce him to settle in Scotland conferred many favours upon him and gave him considerable possessions in the shires of Dunbarton  and Stirling particularly the lands of Roseneath Cardross Auchindown the lands and parish of Drymen or Drummond which last afterwards became the chief title and sirname of the family He also made him senescal or steward of Lennox and assigned him for his armorial bearing three bars wavy or undy  gules  in memory of his having been the happy conductor of her majesty's safe landing in Scotland  The queen also bestowed some marks of her esteem upon him and for his good services gave him one of her maids of honour in marriage By her he had a son named  II MALCOLM of whom all the Drummonds in Scotland are descended  He left issue a son  III MAURICE who succeeded him and was father of  IV JOHN his heir who had a son and successor  V Sir MALCOLM DRYMEN or DRUMMOND  c  Thus our historians have deduced their descent  Strathallan Sir George MacKenzie Hathornden Bayle Martin c c  without mentioning their marriages  The following succession is attested by indisputable documents  This sir Malcolm flourished in the reign of king William who succeeded to the crown of Scotland  anno  and died in  He left issue two sons    Malcolm Beg Drummond  his heir    Roderick Drummond  who in an inquisition on the division of some lands in Dunbartonshire

has these remarkable words  "The women of the family of Drummond  Cambden  for charming beauty and complexion are beyond all others in so much that they have been most delighted in by the kings  c  "  It was certainly so with regard to Annabella and all our historians agree that the beauties of her mind were superior to those of her body and that she was the grace and dignity of that court of which

promiscuously designed of Cargill and Stobhall He was one of the greatest men of his time and was justiciar of Scotland while his elder brother was alive This appears by his pronouncing sentence in a

grandson the earl of Angus with Margaret Tudor the widow of king James IV The lord lyon king at arms was therefore sent to apprehend him It seems the lord lyon did not treat him with that respect that

union strenuously as in his opinion evidently tending to destroy both  It is much for the credit and shows the disinterestedness of this nobleman that though he was forward on every occasion to contribute every thing to the utmost of his power to bring back the exiled family and was educated and firmly established in the principles of the church of Rome yet when the plot was carrying on in to effectuate that restoration he insists as a preliminary  Hook's negotiations  to secure to a Protestant people the Protestant religion as well as their civil liberties  Upon the earl of Marr's insurrection in the marquis of Drummond was a man of great consequence in that cause by the connections he had with some of the most considerable chieftains of the clans and the trust they reposed in him Accordingly he joined the earl with all the force he could raise and behaved with great gallantry at the battle of Dunblain After that attempt was disconcerted and the partizans of the house of Stewart were entirely dispersed he made his escape to France where he died and was buried near his father in the chapel of the Scotch college of Paris  He married lady Jane daughter of George duke of Gordon by whom he had two sons and two daughters    James  his heir    John  commonly called lord John Drummond  st daughter lady  Mary Drummond  Lady  Henriet  died unmarried  XXIV JAMES eldest son of John marquis of Drummond commonly called duke of Perth succeededed to the whole estate He was sent abroad in his infancy to be educated at the Scotch college of Doway and after having gone through the course of studies usually taught in such seminaries and obtained a competent share of academical learning for his further improvement he went to Paris where he acquired those exercises and accomplishments that are necessary for a young nobleman He was a good mathematician and drew with the accuracy and taste of a master About the time of his majority he returned to Scotland and applied himself entirely to the management of his private affairs to the encouragement of the liberal as well as the useful arts to the improvement of husbandry and the manufactures not only upon his own estate but through the whole kingdom wherever his influence extended and thereby became a most excellent member of civil life As he had early imbibed all the principles of his family and devoted himself to the service of the house of Stewart so soon as Charles the young pretender arrived he was amongst the first of those who joined his standard with all the force he could raise He was his first lieutenantgeneral at the battle of Preston commanded at the siege of Carlisle and Stirling and during the whole time of the rebellion on every occasion acted with the greatest courage and conduct having no other point in view but as far as in him lay to promote the good of the cause in which he was embarked In spite of a very delicate constitution he underwent the greatest of fatigues and was the first on every occasion of duty where his head or his hands could be of use bold as a lion in the field of battle but ever merciful in the hour of victory With an heart open to all the delicate feelings of humanity these mild and gentle affections that peculiarly distinguished the brave filled his breast with universal benevolence made him attentive to relieve the miseries and calamities of the distressed whereever he found them and put him always in remembrance that no distinction of party can blot out the character of MAN  After the battle of Cullodden he embarkked for France but by this time his constitution being quite exhausted with the fatigues he had undergone he died in the passage upon the th day of May His body was kept for some days in expectation of making the land but being detained by contrary winds at last it was obliged to be buried in the sea  By an act of parliament it was declared that all persons that were concerned in the rebellion and did not surrender before the month of July should be deemed convicts for high treason But as this James died before the limited time the attainder did not take place against him however it sell with all its weight upon his brother and heir lord John who was embarked in the same cause and in his person the whole estate of Perth was forfeited to the crown This John was educated at Doway where he very soon discovered a strong propensity and forward genius towards a military life and accordingly the bent of his studies were turned that way  After having acquired some of the accomplishments necessary for a soldier he entered into the service of the king of France and when he had passed through several gradations got the command of a regiment which he raised himself and was named the Royal Scotch He had the same warmth and affection for the interest of the house of Stewart that his brother and father had and commanded the French piquets that were sent over in in support of that cause During the time of the rebellion he always acted as a good officer and his corps was of considerable advantage on several occasions to his party After the defeat at Cullodden he made his escape to France in the same ship in which his brother embarked and resumed the command of his own regiment under the conduct of Marshal Saxe in Flanders where he distinguished himself on many occasions but in none more than in the care and concern he showed for any of the British subjects that were taken prisoners or in distress Here he exerted the generosity of his mind and displayed that goodness of heart that ever distinguishes true nobility After the siege of BergenopZoom he was appointed a majorgeneral when lying ill of a fever of which he soon thereafter died and was buried in the chapel of the English nuns at Antwerp He also leaving no issue the representation devolved upon his uncle  Lord John Drummond before mentioned who was eldest son of the chancellor's second marriage He had a noble and liberal education having spent a great part of his younger years in foreign parts particularly at the courts of France and Spain He was master of a dignity of manners that claimed the esteem of every body kind and benevolent to his friends affable and polite in his behaviour to all men firm and steady in the principles which he believed right and though divested of an opulent estate by the attainder of his nephew upon an inconsiderable fortune of his own he maintained the dignity of his family and always appeared on every occasion in a manner suitable to his rank He married st the heiress of Balegarno dly lady Mary Stewart daughter of Charles earl of Traquair but died without issue at Edinburgh  anno  and was buried in the abbay church of Holyroodhouse The next in succession was his brother  Lord Edward Drummond only son of the chancellor's third marriage born in Stirling castle during his father's confinement He went very early abroad to France where he spent the greatest part of his time and lived in a great retirement being very bookish and in a manner quite devoted to religious duties  He married lady Elizabeth daughter of Charles earl of Middleton but dying without issue at Paris  anno  in him ended the maleline of the chancellor's body whereby the representation of that most noble and illustrious family devolves upon James Drummond of Lundin grandson of John earl of Melfort to whom we now return  XXII JOHN earl of Melfort was second son of James third earl of Perth and brothergerman to the chancellor  To the account we have already given of this noble peer page th of this work we must here subjoin that after the revolution when principle induced him to sacrifice all and follow the fortunes of king James VII that same address that same genius and acuteness of parts which distinguished him in Britain made him admired at the court of France and continued him a first favourite of his unfortunate master The favourites of princes are always the objects of envy and the voice of slander and detraction is ever loud and noisy against them This Melfort found from the tongues and pens of many  Clarendon's diary  as much beneath the consideration of the publick as unworthy the nobility and rank of those who propagated the calumny  Balcarras's memoirs  As we dare venture to challenge any person to shew from sufficient proof that he ever betrayed the interest of his master or deviated from these principles of honour and truth for which his family have always been remarkable  He married st Sophia daughter and sole heiress of Margaret

was succeeded by his brother  XXIV JAMES grandson and heir of John earl of Melfort's first marriage  Upon the death of lord Edward Drummond the last male descendant of the chancellor's body the representation of that most noble family devolved upon this James as before observed who now carries the name of Drummond  c  And it being understood that the attainder of the lord Drummond son of the chancellor affected himself only the chancellor never having been attainted and his issuemale being now extinct this James as we are informed is entitled to the dignity of the earl of Perth and as his claim to the peerage appears to be well founded he will no doubt take up all the honours his ancestors enjoyed  He married lady Rachel Bruce daughter of Thomas seventh earl of Kincardine by whom he

Other authors are of opinion that one Alexander son of Ochonacker came from Ireland to Scotland  Scotch comp and Salmon's abridgement  about the end of the th century settled in the northern parts and

seems probable  Writs of the family c  as in many authentic writs they are designed MacKay  alias  Forbes and sometimes there are Forbeses  alias  MacKay  We therefore proceed to deduce their descent

the descent of both under this title  The sirname of Primrose is of great antiquity and local and was first assumed from the lands and village of Primrose lying near the town of lnnerkeithing in Fifeshire  And though there were a great number of that sirname both in Fife and Perthshire in very early times yet as we cannot connect them with this noble family by authentic vouchers we shall proceed to deduce their descent from the first of their ancestors that we find documented by undoubted authority  I DUNCAN PRIMROSE descended of the Primroses of that ilk  Crawfurd's Peerage Nisbet

divinity and was an author of good repute  He went to France where he became minister of the Protestant church at Roan but we can trace him no further and whether he had any succession or not we cannot determine we therefore return to his granduncle  II ARCHIBALD PRIMROSE second son of Dun  n  Crawfurd's Peerage p  appears to have got from his father the lands of Burnbrae which were

transactions of the council  Ibidem  as his father had done in which he acquitted himself entirely to his majesty's satisfaction till the troubles in the country rose to such a height that a correspondence of that kind was absolutely impracticable  As he was a most sincere loyalist he joined the marquis of Montrose immediately after the battle of Kilsyth and continued with him till the unfortunate battle of Philiphangh where he was taken prisoner  He was afterwards tried by the parliament of St Andrews for high treason and was found guilty  anno  but by the intercession of the marquis of Argyle and his other friends his life was spared though he remained in prison till the marquis of Montrose's capitulation with the committee of estates whereby the marquis was obliged to depart the kingdom and sir Archibald with some others obtained their liberty  When the king was a prisoner in the Isle of Wight none was more forward in raising an army for his relief than sir Archibald and after the murder of his royal master he still persisted in his loyalty and accompanied king Charles II into England where he was created a baronet by a royal patent dated at the camp of Woodhouse  Charta penes comitem de Roseberry  st August the preamble whereof runs thus  "In consideration of the many good and faithful services performed to us and our royal father of blessed memory

constancy  King Charles II was not forgetful of his faithful services but immediately after the restoration  Ibidem  begun to reward him according to his great merit He was made lord register for Scotland in August and one of the senators of the college of justice under the title of lord Carrington in which office he acquitted himself with great probity judgment and candour for a considerable number of years  And as he was a true patriot and had nothing so much at heart as the interest of his country he often opposed the measures of the court when he thought they were acting contrary to it and joined those lords who were for the redress of grievances for which he with the duke of Hamilton the earls of Dumfries and Kincardin the lord Cochran  c  were turned out of the council  But the king was so much convinced of his loyalty and fidelity that for a long time he could not be prevailed upon to deprive him of the register's place till at last sir Archibald being old and infirm the king appointed sir George MacKenzie of Tarbet lord register  Charta penes comitem de Roseberry  and at the same time to shew the real esteem and regard he had for sir Archibald made him justicegeneral

proprietors of the lands and barony of Leslyn in Aberdeenshire as soon as sirnames began to be used in this country  Others alledge that one Bartholomew de Leslyn a noble Hungarian came to Scotland with queen Margaret about the year that he was the son of Walter de Leslyn who had assumed his sirname from the castle of Leslyn in Hungary where he was born  c  Sir Robert Sibbald Mr Martin of Clermont and other learned antiquaries deduce their descent from that  Bartholomew who being in great favour with king Malcolm Canmore obtained from that prince grants of several lands in Aberdeenshire which he called Leslyn after his own sirname that he died in the beginning of the reign of king David I leaving issue a son  Malcolm de Leslyn who succeeded him and was progenitor of all the Leslies in Scotland  No Scotch sirname has made a greater figure in Europe than that of Leslie We have now subsisting in Scotland four peers of that name There were at one time three general officers of this name to three several crowned heads  viz  Count Walter Leslie to the emperor of Germany Alexander earl of Leven to king Charles I of Britain and David afterwards lord Newark to Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden  There are at this time several counts of this name in Germany besides many considerable families in France  Bayle's dictionary c  Muscovy Poland and one of the same name governed the kingdom of Hungary as the emperor's viceroy whose daughter he had the honour to marry  We now proceed to deduce the descent of this illustrious family by unquestionable authority  I

observed that in the year when the roll of the Scotch peers was adjusted for the union parliament the lord Ruthven was continued on the roll though the male line of the first lord was extinct some

illustrious family was from Ireland being a son of the Geralds or Fitzgerald earls of Desmonds Kildare  c  one of the most considerable and powerful families in that kingdom  He was called Calinus and upon some discontent having left his own country came to Scotland about the year with a considerable number of his friends and followers He and his retinue were kindly received by king Alexander III  Doctor MacKenzie Abercrombie Crawfurd c  and he served him faithully as long as he lived  About two years after his arrival Haco king of Norway invaded Scotland with a powerful fleet and army with which he landed in the shire of Air  King Alexander immediately marched against him and was joined by this brave stranger and his followers they soon came to an engagement and king Alexander obtained a complete victory over king Haco at Largis in Cunningham  All Scotch historians  anno    In this action the gallant Calinus acquired great glory and reputation by his conduct and intrepidity and became a mighty favourite of king Alexander who to encourage him to settle in Scotland naturalized him and in reward of his great merit and faithful services as the charter bears made him a grant of the whole lands of Kintail in Invernessshire  Chart in archiv familiae de Seaforth  erected into a free barony to him and his heirs for ever by his royal charter dated th January From him therefore we proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family  I CALINUS or CALIN first baron of Kintail having been naturalized by king Alexander III as before observed was much about that prince's court and having at a hunting match with an arrow killed a stag that  Doctor MacKenzie's hist of this family p  in full career was making towards the king his majesty on that account assigned ed him a stag's head  c  for his armorial bearing  He was a man of good parts and took great pains to make himself agreeable to the inhabitants of that part of the country where he resided and became greatly beloved and esteemed  According to doctor George MacKenzie who has wrote a full and elaborate history of this noble family  Ibid vol I p  he married a daughter of Walter lord high steward of Scotland by whom he had a son  Kenneth  who succeeded him  He died at his castle of IslandDonan and was buried in the famous monastery of Icolmkill  anno    II KENNETH second baron of Kintail being a man of great affability and benevolence became very popular in the northern parts but what part he acted during the disputes betwixt the Bruce and the Baliol our historians are silent  He married Morba MacDowal

that profession  In the year when the estates of the nation sent commissioners to Breda to invite king Charles II to come to Scotland and take possession of his just right the baron of Stair was appointed secretary to that embassy and acquitted himself so much to his majesty's satisfaction that he held him in high esteem ever after  He arrived in Scotland with the commissioners before the

was constituted one of the principal secretaries of state As the massacre of Glencoe happened while he was in that office the parliament begun to make some enquiry into the authors of it in the year

as those dignities were known in Scotland  They are said to be sprung from a warlike people called the Moravii who came from Germany to this country in the reign of king Corbred I to whom they gave great assistance in his wars against the Romans  King Corbred rewarded them nobly gave them large possessions in the Northern parts  Martin's collect Gordon's history of Sutherl Cambden Collier's dict Scotch compend c  where they settled from them the county of Murray had its name and their posterity became proprietors of all that large tract of country now called Murray Ross Sutherland Caithness  c  There is a very good history of this noble family written by sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun a man of great ingenuity learning and knowledge but he deduces their descent no farther back than  ALAN thane of Sutherland a man of great power and authority who flourished in the reigns of king Duncan and MacBeth the usurper When the Northern parts had been invaded by a considerable body of Danes and Norvegians under the conduct of their king Olaus and had possessed themselves of a great part of Rossshire  c  this Alan raised his vassals and followers attacked them gave them a total overthrow on a muir called Drumlea near Creigh  Gordon's history of Sutherland penes comit de Sutherland  in Sutherland and drove them entirely out of the country  anno  and the vestiges of that conflict are still to be seen on the said muir of Drumlea where a helmet and coat of mail were lately dug up  c  After MacBeth had murdered king Duncan he greatly dreaded the power of the thane of Sutherland He knew he was a great patriot and had been very active in keeping up the spirits of the loyalists in favours of prince Malcolm the rightful heir of the crown he therefore  ound means to get him put to death also  Ibidem  a little before the restoration of king Malcolm  He was succeeded by his son  WALTER thane of Sutherland who in reward of his father's faithful services  Gord Home Buchanan Crawf c  and great sufferings and his own merit was created earl of Sutherland by king Malcolm III in the very beginning of his reign  anno  and was one of the first in the kingdom who enjoyed that dignity  He died in leaving issue a son  ROBERT second earl of Sutherland who succeeded him and flourished in the reign of king Alexander I  Ibidem  He built the castle of Dunrobin which hath ever since been one of the chief seats of the family  He was succeeded by his son  HUGH FRISKIN  c c  Thus our authors have accounted for the first earls of Sutherland  This Hugh was indeed the real and undoubted progenitor of this noble family but was not the son of Robert which will appear from unquestionable authority  He was the son of Friskin or Friskinus who was proprietor of all those Northern countries  Whether this Friskin was brother or cousin to Robert second earl of Sutherland we cannot pretend to determine but from him we proceed to deduce the descent of this most ancient family by indisputable documents  I FRISKINUS who it is said had that name put upon him by his being a great warrior Friskin in the old language signifying the man with the ready hanger  c  He was one of the greatest men in the kingdom had vast possessions in lands in the counties of Murray Ross Sutherland and Caithness  c  which he divided amongst his children whose posterity assumed their sirnames from their possessions as was the custom of those early times  To his son  William  he gave a great estate in Murray the lands of Duffus Rossile Inchikil Machir Kintrai and many others all mentioned in a charter of confirmation of king William in which are these remarkable words  Chart  com de buchan et  ha  tul of Murray  Quas terras Friskinus pater ejus te  it tempore regis Davidis c  Of this William all

Sutherland which are still in the family's possession  Sir James Dalrymple  and from which his posterity assumed their sirname He according to sir Robert Gordon Mr Crawfurd  c  was third earl of Sutherland but was only the first of this line  He was also a gallant officer and defeated a considerable body of the Danes  Gordon and Crawfurd  and slew their general at Embo in Sutherland in the end of the reign of king William the Lyon  He made a donation to Gilbert archdeacon of Murray afterwards St Gilbert of the lands of Skelbo  Charta penes comit de Sutherland  c  in Sutherland confirmed by a charter under the great seal from king William which is still extant  He died in the beginning of the reign of king Alexander II who succeeded king William  anno  and left issue a son  III WILLIAM second earl of Sutherland who succeeded him  He confirmed his father's donation of the lands of Skelbo to St Gilbert and built the cathedral church of Dornock in Sutherland  Writs of the family of Sutherland  and called it St Gilbert's church the southisle whereof hath been the burial place of the family ever since  This noble earl had also several encounters with the Danes and Norvegians who often invaded that part of the country He gained one remarkable victory over them in the reign of king Alexander II in memory whereof there was a cross erected called Reecross to this day  Gordon's history of Sutherland  Reecross in Galic signifies the king's cross to denote that the Danish king or general was buried there  He died  anno  and was succeeded by his infant son  IV WILLIAM third earl of Sutherland who was a man of great parts a true patriot and no less a brave soldier than an able statesman  There was a controversy which had long subsisted betwixt the bishops of Caithness and earls of Sutherland about the lands of Skelbo Pronsie Thirbolt  c  which was at last amicably compromised between Archibald bishop of Caithness and this earl The indenture or agreement

Scots  "He was without doubt not inferior to any of the Scotch nation in wisdom and dexterity and though he was often provoked by the insolence of some of the bishops to a dislike of their overmuch

Murray duke of Athole and earl of Tullibardin page st of this work  c  to that we refer our readers  HAY Marquis of TWEEDDALE  THE antiquity of the noble and illustrious name of Hay is sufficiently attested both by antient and modern historians and though we shall not pretend to disprove the traditional account of their origin from the battle of Loncarty about the year which is so fully narrated in many Scotch histories and particularly under the title of Errol page th of this work yet we beg leave to offer to the reader's consideration some conjectures which are supported by many presumptive proofs and concurring circumstances  viz  That the sirname of Hay came originally from France that there were lands and a lordship or that deno  ation in  yormandy from which its pre  able the sirname was first assumed  Histoire sommaire de Nor mandie par le sireur de Massavile penes MacFarlane  long before the time or William the Co  This is attested by undoubted authority  Humphry  de Vetulis lord of PontAude  in  nd one of the most considerable  in that country married Albreda de  or  by whom he had a son Roger de Bellamont or Bea  mont lord o  PontAndemar who gave the name of Beaumont  oger to a town in Normandy  Ibidem and Dugdale's baronage of England  and was one of the council who persuaded William duke of Normandy to invade England before the year  In the list of the great captains that came over from Normandy to England with that heroic prince  Hist of Normandy vol I p and roll of Battle Abbay c  le sieur de la Haya is expressly mentioned with several others of the same name which plainly shows that they were a numerous and flourishing family before the conquest  That there were several religious houses founded by them appears from the same history particularly le Abbay de Blancheland in the diocese of Contasines  Histoire de Normandie  was founded and endowed by Richard de la Haya in Normandy  anno    That the Hays in Normandy had the same a  morial bearings with these in Scotland  Books of arms of old French families pen MacFarlane  And that for some generations after they were settled in Scotland many of them were designed by the appellation of de la Haya all which  strong presumptive proofs that they came originally from France  Prynne's collect Rymer's foed Angliae  and it is certain that there are families of that sirname subsisting in Normandy to this day who deduce their pedigree above a hundred years before the conquest  As then there is clear proof that several of that name came to Britain in the year and as it appears from our records that they were settled and making a figure in Scotland within less than an hundred years thereafter it is extremely probable that some of that race came to Scotland with our king David I as it appears from all our histories that several of Norman extraction who had contracted a friendship with that amiable prince when in England came along with him and settled in this country of whom some of the most considerable families in Scotland are descended  Introduction to Fordun's hist p  such as Bruces Maules Somervilles Colviles Normanviles Montgomeries Baliols and many others  'Tis hoped therefore that it reflects no dishonour on this illustrious family to appear to have sprung from a noble family in France who certainly settled in this island within less than an hundred years after the battle of Loncarty and were a great and flourishing family in Normandy before it  And as he first of the family of Errol we find upon record  Chartulary of Scoon Murray Cupar St Andrews c  was William de la Haya who was settled in Perthshire in the reigns of king David I and king Malcolm IV so there is sufficient proof that William de la Haya  Chartulary of Newbottle Kelso Dunfermline c  ancestor of the family of Tweeddale was settled in Lothian much about the same aera  And as it does not appear from any record that they were of the same family it is highly probable that the latter was a son or grandson of one of those great captains of the name of Hay who came over to England with William the Conqueror and attending king David into Scotland settled in the South parts as the ancestor of the family of Errol settled in the North of that kingdom  We now proceed to our documents  I WILLIELMUS de la HAYA the undoubted ancestor of this noble family flourished in the reign of

illustrious family of Wemyss from the ancient earls of Fife is instructed by charters in our public records and other authentic documents still preserved in the family and mentioned by several historians to these we refer our readers  Sir Rob Sibbald's hist of Fife sir James Dalrymple's hist collect appendix to Nisbet dvol Malcolm's history of the family who had perused all their writs c  and shall here only give a brief account of the origin of their sirname which like many others in this country is certainly local and was first assumed by the proprietors of the lands of old called Wemyssshire which contained all that tract of ground lying betwixt the lower part of the water of Ore and the sea  These lands got their name from the great number of caves that are on them all along the sea coast A cave in the old Galic or Celtic language was called Vumhs from that these lands got the name of Vamsshire In process of time they came to be called Wemyssshire which name they still retain as will appear from several charters under the great seal hereafter narrated and from hence the sirname of the family  The lands of Wemyssshire the parishes of Kennoway Markinch Lochoreshire  c  which lye contiguous to one another were the undoubted property of the ancient earls of Fife a great part whereof were given by Gillimichael the fourth earl and Duncan his eldest son to his second son Hugo the progenitor of this noble family And as the many ample privileges conferred upon the great MacDuss by king Malcolm Canmore and enjoyed by his posterity are fully narrated by our historians and briefly under the title earl of Fife page th of this work we proceed to deduce the descent of the family of Wemyss from their immediate ancestor  IV GILLIMICHAEL fourth earl of Fife great grandson of MacDuff the first earl was witness to the foundation charter of the abbay of Holyroodhouse  Chartulary of St Andrews and Dunfermline  anno  and is mentioned in several other charters of king David

He obtained also from his brother Duncan the fifth earl some lands in the parish of Markinch with the superiority of the patronage of the church thereof which is instructed by a donation hereafter mentioned  There is in the chartulary of Dunfermline in the reign of king Malcolm IV  Ibid p  a precept directed to Duncan earl of Fife and Hugo son of Gillimichael  c  before the year in which year king Malcolm died  Hugo died in the year or and was succeeded by his son  VI HUGO or EGO who being proprietor of the lands of Markinch confirmed his uncle's donation in these words  Omnibus c Hugo

of distinguished rank and figure and in his younger days took the app  llation of John of Methkil from a seaport town of that name which is situate near the east end of Wemyssshire  This is instructed by a convention betwixt the prior and convent of St Andrews and the archdean thereof wherein  Johannes de Methkill  Ibid p  Andreas de Moravia Robertus de Haya Galfridus vicecomes de Fife  are witnesses  anno    He afterwards made a donation of the patronage of the church of Wemyss to the monastery of Soltray in these words  "  Dominus Johannes de Methkill miles c dedisse cdeo et ecclesiae

this noble family are originally from Flanders that a man of rank came from that country in the beginning of the reign of king David I settled in Scotland and was called Le Flammang from the country

Flamang Le Flamang and De Flamaticus  c  Sir Ja  Dalrymple's hist collect c  and after they had assumed Fleming for their sirname that in Latin was called  Flandrensis  The first of them we find

office he did his country signal service  This sir Malcolm's capacity and integrity being well known to the whole nation he was intrusted with the tuition of the young king  After the unfortunate battles of Duplin and Halidonhill when the Baliol's party begun to prevail and increase the governor and estates of the nation thought it adviseable to send his majesty and his royal consort to France for the more security of their persons and the faithful sir Malcolm was pitched upon to be their conductor which important charge he executed with dexterity and success  Abercrombie and all Scotch historians  They arrived safe in France and met with a most noble and kind reception from king Philip  Sir Malcolm immediately returned to his government and command of the castle of Dunbarton which

great prince soon put him in possession of all the estates his father enjoyed in Scotland of which he had been most unjustly forfeited by king Edward I for his loyalty to his lawful prince That monarch also deprived him of his estates in England which were very considerable and bestowed them upon his English nobles who had been most active in the Scotch wars  His lands in Yorkshire called
