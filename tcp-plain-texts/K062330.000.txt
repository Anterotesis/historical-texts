 THE DESERTER A POEM  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON AT THE FEATHERS IN NEW BOND STREET  MDCCLXX  PRICE ONE SHILLING  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD VISCOUNT NUNEHAM THIS LITTLE POEM AS AN OFFERING OF FRIENDSHIP IS INSCRIBED BY HIS AFFECTIONATE SERVANT  EDWARD JERNINGHAM  THE DESERTER  I  Conceal'd beneath illustrious deeds  A simple tale I rear  A tale that softey'd Pity reads  And honors with a tear  II  The Spaniard left the hostile plain  To seek his native land  Beneath the sails that swept the main  CABEYSA join'd the band  III  Who as he met his country's foes  Within the field of Fame  Above his rank obscure arose  And grac'd his humble name  IV  Yet not the early wreath of Fame  With haughtiness was twin'd  Nor pride nor fickleness could claim  The empire of his mind  V  The lowly hut beneath whose roof  He sigh'd a sad adieu  Received him time and distanceproof  To love and MARY true  VI  This hamletfair by Fortune scorn'd  Seem'd Nature's fav'rite child  With hand profuse by her adorn'd  The flow'ret of the wild  VII  Her neat but homely garment press'd  The pure the feeling heart  Oft sought in vain behind the vest  Of decorated art  VIII  "If sharing all thy cares she said  "Has paled my beauty's rose  "Ah know for thee the heart that bled  "With all its passion glows  IX  "Blest moment to my wish that gives  "The long long absent youth  "He livesth'endear'd CABEYSA lives  "And love confirms the truth  X  "When thy brave comrades fell around  "What pow'r's benignant care  "Secur'd thee from the fatal wound  "And MARY from despair  XI  "Oft in the troubling dream of night  "I saw the rushing spear  "Nor did the morn's awak'ning light  "Dispel the ling'ring fear  XII  "Thy tender fears the youth replied  "Ah give them to the air  "To happiness we're now allied  "And pleasure be our care  XIII  "Let us pursue the joy begun  "Nor lose by dull delay  "Say MARY shall tomorrow's sun  "Illume our nuptial day  XIV  With look declin'd she blush'd consent  Reserve that takes alarm  And Love and Joy their influence lent  To raise meek Beauty's charm  XV  The guests to hail the wedded pair  Beneath their roof repair'd  With them the little feast to share  Their scanty purse prepar'd  XVI  Tho' no delicious wines were pour'd  Mirth took his destin'd place  The handmaid Neatness spread the board  And sage Content said grace  XVII  Scarce thro' one hasty week had Love  His grateful blessings shed  When bliss as flies the frighted dove  Their humble mansion fled  XVIII  'Twas at BELLONA'S voice it flew  That call'd to war's alarms  Bad the youth rise to valor true  And break from MARY'S arms  XIX  But she still strained him to her heart  To lengthen the adieu  "Ah what she said shou'dst thou depart  "Shall I and sorrow do  XX  "Say valiant youth when thou'rt away  "Who'll raise my drooping head  "How shall I chace the fears that say  "Thy lov'd CABEYSA'S dead  XXI  "With thine my fate I now involve  "Intent thy course to steer  "No words shall shake my firm resolve  "Not ev'n that trickling tear  XXII  "Fram'd for each scene of soft delight  "He said thy gentle form  "As shrinks the lily at the blight  "Will droop beneath the storm  XXIII  "Blest in thy presence ev'ry pain  "She added brings its charm  "And love tho' falls the beating rain  "Will keep this bosom warm  XXIV  Her zeal the supplement of strength  Upheld her many a day  But Nature's pow'rs subdued at length  On Sickness' couch she lay  XXV  Three painful days unseen she lay  Of him she held so dear  "Ah does he thus my love repay  She saidand dropt a tear  XXVI  "CABEYSA at a league's remove  "Dwells on the tentspread hill  "Ah wherefore did he vow true love  "And not that vow fulfil  XXVII  Yet not deficiency of truth  Forbad to yield relief  Stern pow'r withheld the tender youth  And duty to his chief  XXVIII  Who wiselycounsel'd drew a line  To check the hand of Stealth  That ravag'd wide th' encircling vine  The humble peasant's wealth  XXIX  To pass the line it was ordain'd  Whoever shou'd presume  Shou'd a Deserter be arraign'd  And meet the coward's doom  XXX  This law by equity approv'd  And to the peasant dear  Soon to the brave CABEYSA prov'd  Destructively severe  XXXI  Now MARY'S image haunts his soul  In Woe's dark tints array'd  While to his breast compassion stole  And all her claims display'd  XXXII  "For me her native home he said  "For me each weeping friend  "For me a father's arms she fled  "And shall not love attend  XXXIII  "Say for a chosen lover's sake  "What more cou'd woman do  "And now that health and peace forsake  "Shall I forsake her too  XXXIV  "Now stretch'd upon the naked ground  "Oppress'd with pain and fear  "She casts a languid eye around  "Nor sees CABEYSA near  XXXV  "Now now she weeps at my delay  "And shall neglect be mine  "Submit ye fears to Pity's sway  He spokeand cross'd the line  XXXVI  Soon at his sight the fair resum'd  Each captivating grace  On her pale cheek the rose rebloom'd  And smiles illum'd her face  XXXVII  Yet to that cheek return'd in vain  Bright Health's vermilion dye  For bitter tears that cheek shall stain  And dim her brilliant eye  XXXVIII  The youth returning thro' the gloom  At midnight's secret hour  Was seiz'dand to dishonour's tomb  Doom'd by the martial pow'r  XXXIX  To meet his fate at wake of day  Love's victim he was led  No weakness did his cheek betray  While to the chief he said  XL  "If in the battle death I've dar'd  "In all its horror drest  "Think not this scene by thee prepar'd  "Sheds terror on my breast  XLI  "Yet at MARIA'S hapless fate  "My fortitude impairs  "Unmann'd I sink beneath the weight  "Of her oppressive cares  XLII  "Ah when her grieftorn heart shall bleed  "Some little solace grant  "Oh guard her in the hour of need  "From the rude hand of want  XLIII  Now kneeling on the fatal spot  He twin'd the dark'ning band  The twelve who drew th'unwelcome lot  Reluctant took their stand  XLIV  And now the murm'ring throng grew dumb  'Twas silence allsave where  At intervals the mournful drum  Struck horror on the ear  XLV  Now with their deathfraught tubes uprear'd  The destin'd twelve were seen  And now the explosion dire was heard  That clos'd CABEYSA'S scene  XLVI  Another scene remain'd behind  For MARY to supply  She comes mark how her tortur'd mind  Speaks thro' th'expressive eye  XLVII  "Forbearwill ye in blood she said  "Your cruel hands imbrue  "On me on me your vengeance shed  "To me alone 'tis due  XLVIII  "Relentand to these arms again  "The valiant youth restore  "I ravealready on the plain  "He welters in his gore  XLIX  Advancing now she pierc'd the crowd  And reach'd the fatal place  Where listing from the corse the shroud  No semblance cou'd she trace  L  "Is thisoh blasting view she cried  "The youth who lov'd too well  "His love for me the law defied  "And for that love he fell  LI  "When will the grave this form receive  "The grave to which he's fled  "There only there I'll cease to grieve  She spokeAnd join'd the dead  FINIS
