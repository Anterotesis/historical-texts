jackass and mare and to that procreated between the horse and sheass we shall give the denomination of  bardeau  The differences which subsist between these two mongrel animals have never hitherto been marked by any author These differences however afford the most certain criterion of distinguishing the relative influence of males and females in the product of generation A comparison of these two mules and other mongrels proceeding from a mixture of different species will give us more precise ideas concerning this relative influence than could be obtained by simply comparing two individuals of the same species  The bardeau is much smaller than the mule and seems to preserve the dimensions of its mother the sheass and the mule retains the dimensions of the mare Hence in mixed species the size of the body appears to depend more upon the mother than the father Now these two animals differ in figure The neck of the bardeau is thinner the back sharper and the crupper more pointed while the forehead of the mule is better shaped the neck more beautiful the sides rounder and the crupper more plump Hence both of these animals retain more of the mother than of the father not only in magnitude but in figure of body This remark however does not apply to the head limbs and tail The head of the bardeau is longer and not so thick in proportion as that of the ass and the head of the mule is shorter and thicker than that of the horse Hence in the figure and dimensions of the head they have a greater resemblance to the father than to the mother The tail of the bardeau is garnished with hair nearly in the same manner as that of the horse and the tail of the mule is almost naked like that of the ass In this extreme part of the body therefore the similarity to the father predominates The ears of the mule are longer than those of the horse and the ears of the bardeau are shorter than those of the ass The limbs of the mule are hard and limber like those of the horse and the limbs of the bardeau are  more fleshy Hence these two animals in the form of the head limbs and other extremities of the body have a greater resemblance to the father than to the mother  In the years and I made two hegoats copulate with several ewes and I obtained nine mules seven males and and two females Struck with this difference between the number of males and females I endeavoured to discover whether the number of male mules produced by the ass and mare predominated in the same proportion The information I received did not ascertain this point but I learned that the number of male mules always exceeded that of the females The Marquis de SpontinBeaufort made a dog intermix with a shewolf and procured four mules three of which were males  Letter from the Marquis de SpontinBeaufort to M de Buffon dated Namur July and attested by two letters from M Surirey de Boisly likewise dated Namur June and July  In fine having made inquiries concerning mules which are more easily obtained I learned that the number of males greatly exceeded that of the females In the article  Canarybirds  See tom de l'Hist Nat des Oiseaux  I remarked that of nine young produced between a goldfinch and a Canarybird there were only three females These are the only certain facts I could collect on this subject  What is related by different authors concerning the jumars appears to be very suspicious The Sicur Léger in his history of the Vaudois tells us  That in the vallies of Piedmont there are mongrel animals called  jumars  that when engendered by a bull and a mare they are denominated  baf  or  buf  and when produced by a bull and a sheass they receive the appellation of  bif  that these jumars have no horns and are of the size of mules that they are very swift that he mounted one of them on the th day of September and performed in a single day a journey of eighteen leagues or fifty four Italian miles and that they were surer and more easy than a horse  From an assertion of this kind we would be led to believe that these jumars produced by the bull and the mare and sheass either exist or did formerly exist yet I have never been able to discover any confirmation of these facts  Dr Shaw in his history of Algiers p says  To the mule we may join the  Kumrab  as the Algerines call a little serviceable beast of burden begot betwixt an ass and a cow That which I saw at Algiers where it was not looked upon as a rarity was single hoofed like the ass but distinguished from it in having a sleeker skin with the tail and the head though without horns in fashion of the dam's  Dr Shaw is an author who deserves credit However having consulted several persons who had been in Barbary and particularly the Chevalier James Bruce they all assured me that they had no knowledge concerning these animals engendered by an ass and a cow  which merits  more attention than it has yet received for the mysteries of generation by the concourse of different species and the ascertaining of the proportional effective powers of males and females in every kind of reproduction can alone be developed by an assemblage of similar facts  Of my nine mules produced by the hegoat and the ewes the first was brought forth on the th day of April When examined three days  after birth and compared with lambs of the same age it differed from them in the following particulars The ears upper part of the head as well as the distance between the eyes were larger It had besides a band of whitish gray hair from the nap of the neck to the extremity of the tail The four legs the superior part of the neck the breast and belly were covered with the same white coarse hair There was a small quantity of wool upon the flanks only and even this short curled wool was mixed with a great deal of hair The legs of this mule were also a foot and a half longer than those of a lamb of the same age When examined eighteen days after birth the white hairs were partly fallen off and replaced by brown hairs similar in colour to those of the hegoat and nearly as coarse The limbs continued to be more than a foot and a half longer than those of the lamb and on account of this length of limbs it did not walk so well as the lamb This lamb was killed by an accident and I took no farther notice of the mule till four months afterward when I compared it with a sheep of the same age In the mule from the space between the eyes to the extremity of the muzzle the distance was at least an inch shorter than in the sheep and the head of the mule was more than half an inch broader at the broadest part Hence the head of this mule was thicker and shorter than that of a sheep of equal age The curvature  of the upper jaw taken from the corner of the mouth was near half an inch longer in the mule than in the sheep The head of the mule was not covered with wool but with long bushy hair The tail was two inches shorter than that of the sheep  In the beginning of the year I obtained from the union of a hegoat with ewes eight other mules six of which were males and two females Two of them died before I could examine them but they seemed to resemble those who survived Two of them a male and a female had four teats two on each side like those of the goats In general these mules had long hair on the belly and particularly about the penis as in the hegoat and also on the feet and particularly those behind Most of them had the chanfrin less arched than is common to lambs the distance between the hoofs larger and the tail shorter  Under the article  Dog  I related some experiments made with a view to procure an intermixture between a dog and a wolf where all the precautions employed for that purpose were abortive  See vol IV p  The conclusion drawn from these experiments was in the following words 'I pretend not absolutely to affirm that the wolf in no age or country never intermixed with dogs The contrary is asserted positively by the antients Aristotle remarks that though  animals of different species seldom intermix yet it certainly happens among dogs foxes and wolves' I have since learned the propriety of being thus cautious in my conclusions for M le Marquis de SpontinBeaufort has succeeded in the junction of a dog and a wolf I was informed of this fact by M Surirey de Boissy in a letter which he wrote me in the following terms  Namur    June    The Marquis de Spontin has in this place reared a very young shewolf to whom he gave as a companion a dog of nearly the same age They were left at full liberty and came into the apartments the kitchen the stable c They live in the most intimate friendship and are extremely caressing lying under the table and upon the feet of the persons who sit round it  The dog is a kind of mongrel mastiff and full of vigour During the first six months the wolf was fed with milk and afterward with raw flesh which it preferred to what was roasted When she eat no person durst approach her At other times she permitted every freedom except abuse She caressed all the dogs which came near her till she began to give a preference to her old companion after which she was enraged at every other She was covered for the first time on the th day of March last Her amours continued fifteen days with pretty frequent repetitions  and she brought forth her young on the sixth day of June at eight o'clock in the morning Hence the time of her gestation was seventythree days The young were four in number and of a blackish colour Some of them have the half of the breast and the pats white These colours are derived from the dog who is black and white From the moment of littering she growled and attacked all who approached her She no longer distinguished her masters and would even have devoured the dog if he had come near her  I add that she has been chained ever since she made a break at her gallant who had leaped a neighbouring wall in order to come at a bitch in season that she nearly worried his rival and that the coachman separated them by repeated blows of a large bludgeon and conducted her to her lodge where imprudently commencing his chastisement her fury rose to such a degree that she bit him twice in the thigh and the wounds confined him six weeks to his bed  In my answer to this letter I thanked M de Boissy and added some remarks with a view to remove my doubts M le Marquis de Spontin having seen my answer obligingly wrote me in the following terms  Namur    July    I read with much satisfaction the judicious remarks you transmitted to M Surirey de Boissy whom I  had begged to communicate to you during my absence a fact which cannot be denied notwithstanding the force of your arguments and the opinion I have always entertained as well as the rest of the world of the excellence of the many learned productions by which you have enlightened the republic of letters But whether it was an effect of chance or one of those sports of Nature who as you remark sometimes departs from her established laws the fact is incontestible and you will be convinced of its truth if you give credit to what I have the honour of writing you which can be attested by two hundred persons at least who were witnesses to it as well as myself This shewolf was only three days old when I purchased it from a peasant who had carried it off after killing the mother I fed it with milk till it was able to eat flesh I recommended to those who had the care of it to caress and handle it often with a view to render it as tame as possible At last it became so familiar that I have taken it to hunt in the woods at the distance of a league from my house without any danger of losing it Sometimes when I was unable to call it back it returned of its own accord in the night I was always more certain of keeping it at home when I had a dog for it was fond of dogs and those who had overcome their natural repugnance sported with it as if they had been  animals of the same species During all this time it attacked only cats and poultry whom it strangled without discovering any inclination to eat them As soon as she attained the age of twelve months her ferocity increased and I began to perceive that she had a strong desire to attack sheep and bitches I then chained her because she frequently sprung upon her master when he attempted to restrain her she was at least one year old when I introduced her to the acquaintance of the dog who covered her She has been kept in my garden which is situated in the centre of the town since the end of November last and therefore no male wolf can be supposed to have had any communication with her As soon as she came in season she discovered such an affection for the dog and the dog for her that each of them howled frightfully when they were not together She was first covered on the th day of March and twice each day during the two following weeks They continued attached to each other more than a quarter of an hour at every embrace during which time the wolf complained and seemed to suffer pain but the dog was perfectly at his ease Three weeks after her pregnancy was perceptible On the th day of June she brought forth four young whom she still suckles though they are five weeks old and have pretty long sharp teeth They have a  perfect resemblance to puppies having long pendulous ears One of them is black with a white breast which was the colour of the dog The others will probably be of the colour of the mother The hair of each of them is courser than that of ordinary dogs There is but one female with a very short tail like the dog who had scarcely any tail They promise to be large strong and very ferocious The mother is extremely solicitous concerning their wellfare I doubt whether I shall keep her any longer having been chagrined by an accident that befell my coachman whom she bit so cruelly that he has been confined to his bed these six weeks past But I will engage that if preserved she will again have puppies by the same dog who is white with large black spots on the back I hope Sir that what I have said will answer for a reply to your remarks and that you will no longer hesitate concerning the truth of this singular event  My doubts are entirely removed and I am happy to embrace this opportunity of expressing my thanks The establishment of a rare fact in natural history is a great acquisition The means of obtaining such facts are always difficult and often as we have seen very dangerous It was for this last reason that I fequestered my wolf and dog from all society I had formerly reared a young wolf who till the age of twelve months did no mischief and followed his master  like a dog But in the second year he committed so many excesses that it was necessary to kill him I learned by experience that these animals though softened by education resume with age their natural ferocity Willing to prevent these inconveniences I kept my shewolf always confined along with the dog and I acknowledge that this method of procuring an union between them was ill imagined for in this state of slavery and disgust the dispositions of the wolf instead of being softened were soured to such a degree that she was more ferocious than if she had been at full liberty and the dog having been early detached from his equals and from the society of men had assumed a savage and cruel character which the bad humour of the wolf served only to augment so that during the two last years their antipathy rose to such a degree that they desired nothing so much as to devour each other In the experiment made by the Marquis de Spontin every circumstance was reversed The dog was in his ordinary condition He had all the mildness and other qualities which this docile animal acquires by his intercourse with man The wolf was likewise reared in perfect freedom and familiarity along with the dog which by being under no restraint had lost his repugnance to her and she by the same mild management became susceptible of attachment to him She therefore received him with cordiality whenever  the hour of Nature struck And though she seemed to complain and to suffer she felt more pleasure than pain for she allowed the operation to be repeated every day during all the time she was in season Besides the proper moment for this unnatural union was seized The wolf felt the impression of love for the first time She was only in the second year of her age and of course had not entirely resumed her natural ferocity  All these circumstances and perhaps some others which were not observed contributed to the success of this fertile embrace From what has been remarked it would appear that the most certain method of rendering animals unfaithful to their species is to place them like man in society and to accustom them gradually to individuals which without such precautions would not only be indifferent but hostile to each other However this matter stands the Marquis de Spontin has ascertained the fact that the dog can produce with the wolf even in our climates I could have wished that the success of this experiment had induced its author to try the union of a wolf with a bitch and of foxes with dogs But if this desire should be considered as exorbitant he must ascribe it to the insatiable enthusiasm of a naturalist  A similar fact has been announced by M Bourgelat in a letter to me dated April 'My Lord Pembroke' says he 'informed me that within these few days he saw a large mastiff copulate with a shewolf that the wolf is tame that she is always in her master's chamber and consequently under his eye that she never goes out alone and that she follows her master with all the fidelity of a dog He adds that an animal merchant has had at four different times mules produced by the wolf and dog He alledges that the wolf is only a wild dog and in this opinion he is joined by the celebrated anatomist Mr Hunter He thinks differently with regard to the fox He tells me that a bitch who was a daughter of a wolf and belonged to Lord Clanbrazil intermixed with a setting dog and produced puppies which according to his hunter will be excellent pointers'    But to return to our mules In those I obtained from the hegoat and ewe the number of males was as seven to two in those from the dog and shewolf the males were as three to one and in those from the goldfinch and Canary bird the mules were as sixteen to three It appears therefore to be certain that the number of males which is always greater than that of females in pure species is still greater in mixed species Hence the male in general has a greater influence on the produce of generation than the female because he transmits his sex to the greatest number and because the number of males augments in proportion to the remoteness of the species who intermix The same thing must happen in the conjunction of different races By crossing the remotest of these we will not only procure the most beautiful productions but the greatest number of males  I have often endeavoured to investigate the reason why any religion or any government should prohibit the marriage of brothers and sisters Did men learn by very antient experience that the union of brother and sister was less fertile than an intermixture with strangers or that the former produced fewer males and feebler and more unhandsome children It is certain however that from a thousand experiments both in men and the other animals crossing the breed is the only mode of ennobling and preserving the perfection of the species  To these facts and experiments let us add what the antients have said upon this subject Aristotle tells us that the mule engenders with the mare and that the junction produces an animal which the Greeks called  hinnus  or  ginnus  He likewise remarks that the shemule easily conceives but seldom brings the foetus to perfection  Arist hist animal lib cap  Of these two facts the second is more rare than the first and both happen only in warm climates M de Bory of the royal academy of Sciences and formerly governour of the American islands communicated to me a recent fact of this kind in a letter dated May of which the following is an extrat  You will perhaps recollect Sir that M d' Almbert read last year in the Academy of Sciences a letter which informed him that a shemule in the island of St Domingo  had brought forth a foal I was desired to write for proper vouchers of the fact and I have now the honour of sending you the certificate which I received My correspondent is worthy of the highest credit He adds that he has seen mules cover indiscriminately shemules and mares and likewise shemules covered by stallions and hemules  This certificate is judicially attested and signed by witnesses of unquestionable veracity The substance of it is that on the th day of May M de Nort Knight of St Louis and late Major of the Royal Legion of St Domingo had a shemule brought to him which was said to be sick that her belly was remarkably large and a membrance protruded through the vagina M de Nort believing the animal to be inflated sent for a Negro farrier who had been accustomed to take care of diseased animals that this Negro who arrived in the absence of M de Nort had thrown down the mule in order to give her a draught that the moment after the fall she brought forth a young mule perfectly formed and covered with long and very black hair that the young mule lived an hour but that having been both hurt by the fall and foal died soon after birth and the mother ten hours after and in fine that the young mule was skinned and the skin sent says M de Nort to Doctor Matty who deposited it in the Musaeum of the Royal Society at London  Other eyewitnesses and particularly M Cazavant surgeon add that the young mule seemed to have been mature and well formed that from the appearance of its hair head and ears it had a greater resemblance to the ass than common mules that the paps of the mother were swelled and full of milk that when the ignorant Negro perceived the feet issuing from the vagina he drew so forcibly as to invert the uterus and lacerate the parts which occasioned the death of both mother and foal  These facts which appear to be well ascertained demonstrate that in warm climates the mule is not only capable of conception but of bringing the foetus to full maturity From my correspondents in Spain and Italy I learn that similar events have happened in these countries But the facts are not so completely authenticated It still remains to be inquired whether this St Domingo mule was impregnated by an ass or a mule The superior resemblance of the young mule to the former seems to indicate that she had been covered by an ass The ferocious ardour of the ass renders him very indifferent in the choice of females and makes him attack with nearly the same avidity the sheass the mare and the mule  We may therefore consider it as an established fact that the hemule can generate and the shemule produce Like other animals they have a seminal liquor and all the organs necessary  to generation But mongrel animals are always less fertile and more tardy than those of a pure species Besides mules have never produced in cold climates seldom in warm regions and still more seldom in temperate countries  To the above facts the Translator has to add an instance of the prolific powers of a she mule in the North of Scotland Having heard that a mule belonging to Mr David Tullo farmer in Auchtertyre in the county of Forfar had some years ago brought forth a foal he transmitted a few queries to be put to Mr Tullo and requested that his answers might be legally attested before a magistrate This request was chearfully complied with and the following is an exact copy of the queries answers and attestations  Interrogatories to be put to Mr Tullo tenant in Auchtertyre parish of Newtyle and county of Forfar with his answers thereto    mo  Had you ever a shemule At what period Is it true that the mule had a foal At what time was she covered and when did she foal  Answered by Mr Tullo That he bought a shemule about twenty years ago That she was constantly in season for a horse That about some years thereafter he gave her a horse and that she thereafter gave him a foal about the th of June The mule's price was four pounds five shillings Sterling    do  What was the colour of the foal Was there any thing particular in its figure  Answer The foal was exactly the colour of its mother inclined to black with a very large head big ears and small tail and the declarant thinks had its head been weighed when foaled it would have weighted nearly as much as its body    tio  How long was the animal allowed to live  Answer The next day after the mule foaled it was sent with its mother to the Loch of Lundie in order to let the foal die as the declarant could not want the mule's work and the mother seemed not fond of the foal That it was accordingly left and next day came to Auchtertyre about two miles distance over a hill with the cattle of Auchtertyre that had been grazing near to that place and was drowned in a ditch the day following    to  Was its skin preserved or the head or any other bones of the skeleton Could any part thereof be still found  Answered neither the skin nor any part of the skeleton was preserved nor can now be had though the declarant has often regretted the not preserving the foal as its mother always performed any work that a horse of fifteen pounds value could do    to  Is the mother still alive What is her age  Answer The mother died about eight years ago of an epidemic cold that was raging among the horses in this country The mule had little or no milk after foaling and the foal got some cow's milk And this is all that he remembers of the matter  DAVID TULLO  Auchtertyre  th February  We James Small tenant in Burnmouth and Rober Ramsay tenant in Newtyle hereby certify That we have often seen the mule above described and we know that she had a foal as is narrated by David Tullo  JAMES SMALL  ROB RAMSAY  Ballantyne house  th February  The within interrogatories were put to David Tullo tenant in Auchtertyre anent the mule he had and the foal she produced to which he gave the answers subjoined to each query and signed them as did James small and Robert Ramsay attesting the truth thereof in presence of  GEORGE WATSON J P  The original attestation is in the possession of the Translator and he lately transmitted  otorial or authenticated copies of it to the Count de Buffon and to Thomas Pennant  Esq  of Downing in Flintshire  Hence their barrenness without being absolute  may be regarded as positive since their productions are so rare that a few examples only can  be collected But men were wrong in asserting that mules were absolutely barren and that all animals proceeding from a mixture of different species were like the mules incapable of producing The facts formerly related concerning the produce of a hegoat and a ewe of a dog and a shewolf and of Canary birds and goldfinches demonstrate that these mongrels are by no means barren and that some of them are equally prolific with their parents  It is an unhappy circumstance that a small and often nominal error extends over every object to which it has any relation and at last not only becomes in an error in fact but gives rise to a general prejudice that is more difficult to remove than the particular opinion from which it originated A single word a name like that of  mule  which ought solely to represent the idea of the animla proceeding from the ass and mare has been improperly applied to the animal produced by the horse and the sheass and afterward with still greater impropriety to all quadrupeds and all birds of mixed species And  as this word  mule  in its original acceptation included the idea of the barrenness common to the animal proceeding from the ass and mare this idea of barrenness has been conveyed to all beings who have the denomination of  mules  I say to all beings for independent of quadrupeds birds and fishes mule plants have been fancied to which without hesitation this general sterility has also been ascribed None of these beings however is absolutely barren The  mule  properly so called or the animal produced by the ass mare is not absolutely barren but its prolific powers when compared with those of pure species or even with those of other animals of a mixed species are much more feeble and uncertain  All mules says Prejudice are vitiated animals incapable of producing No animal says Reason and Experience though proceeding from two species is absolutely barren It ought to be remarked however that in pure as well as mixed species the degrees of fertility are very different In the first some like the fishes and insects multiply annually by millions others as the birds and small quadrupeds produce by twenties and dozens in fine others as man and the larger quadrupeds produce only one in twelve months The number produced may be said to be in the inverse proportion of the magnitude of animals The horse and ass bring forth but one in a year and in the same period  the mouse and Guinea pig produce thirty or forty Hence the fecundity of these small animals is thirty or forty times greater and if a scale were formed of the different degrees of fertility the small animals above enumerated would occupy the highest points while the horse and ass would be found nearly in the lowest for the elephant alone is less fertile  In mixt species there are also differnt degrees of fecundity for animals proceeding from two species partake of two natures and are in general less fertile and this want of fertility increases in proportion to the infecundity of the parents Hence if the horse and ass two animals naturally not very fertile mix the original infecundity instead of diminishing in the mongrel race must be augemented The mule will not only be less fertile than its parents but perhaps the most unfertile of all mongrels because all the other mules which produce such as those proceeding from the hegoat and ewe from the goldfinch and Canary bird c are much more fruitful than the ass and horse It is to this original and particular cause that the infecundity of the mule and bardeau should be referred A second cause still more particular renders the last animal less prolific than the first The mule proceeding from the ass and mare retains the ardent temperament of the father and of course possesses a high degree of prolific power while the bardeau proceeding from the  horse and ass is like its father less potent and less able to engender Besides the mare being less ardent than the sheass is likewise more fertile since she conceives and retains with more certainty Thus every circumstance concurs in rendering the mule more prolific than the bardeau for ardour of temperament in the male which is so necessary to successful generation and the number produced is hurtful in the female and almost always prevents conception and retention  This fact holds generally both in man and the other animals Cold women joined to ardent men produce a number of children A woman on the contrary who feels too acutely the emotions of love is seldom fertile But in most women who are merely passive the effect is more certain because the fruit of generation is less disturbed by the convulsions of pleasure These are so marked and so destructive to conception in some females such as the sheass that she requires cold water to be thrown on her crupper and even heavy blows in order to repress them Without such disagreeable aids the sheass would never be impregnated till age abated the fury of her passion The same means are sometimes employed to make mares conceive  But it may be said that female dogs and cats who seem to be more ardent than the mare and sheass never fail to conceive and therefore  that the fact advanced concerning the infecundity of females whose feelings are exquisite is too general and admits of many exceptions But the example of dogs and cats instead of being an exception is rather a confirmation of the general rule for in the bitch however violent the convulsions of the internal organs may be supposed they have full time to be appeased during the long interval between consummation and the retreat of the male who cannot detach himself till the turgidity and irritation of the parts subside The female cat is in a similar situation Of all females she appears to be the most ardent in her amours for she calls to the males with lamentable cries which announce the most pressing necessity But as in the dog from a particular conformation of the male cat this violent female never misses conception Her desires which are excessive are necessarily tempered with a pain almost equally acute The glans of the male cat is covered with large sharp prickles The intromission of it therefore must be extremely painful to the female who announces her sufferings by loud cries The pain is so great that she instantly makes every effort to escape and the male to retain her is obliged to seize her by the neck with his teeth and to compell submission from the very female who had invited his embraces  In domestic animals who are well fed and taken care of multiplication is greater than in those who continue in a wild state Of this we have an example in domestic dogs and cats who produce several times every year but when in a natural state they produce only once in the same period Domestic birds furnish an example still more striking Can the fecundity of any species of wild birds be compared to that of a well fed hen when properly served with a cock And even in the human species what a vast difference betwen the scanty propagation of savages and the immense population of civilized nations under the administration of a wise government But we here confine ourselves to the fecundity natural to animals in full possession of liberty the relative fertility of whom is exhibited in the following Table from which some important conclusions may be drawn  TABLE

diminishes in proportion to the magnitude of the animal In general this same scale of fecundity extends to all the other tribes of animated Nature Small birds are more prolific than the larger kinds The same thing holds in fishes and perhaps in insects But confining our remarks to quadrupeds alone it appears from the above table that the hog is the only exception to the general rule for from the size of his body he should be ranked with those animals which produce only two or three once in twelve months while in fact he is equally prolific with the small quadrupeds  This table contains all that is known with regard to the fertility of pure species But the fecundity of mixed species which is always less than that of the pure merits particular attention The reason will be apparent by supposing for example that all the males in the horse species and all the sheasses or rather all the jackasses and all the mares were destroyed In this case those mixed animals alone which we call  mules  and  bardeaux  would be produced and the number brought forth would be much fewer than that of horses or asses because the natural conformities or relations between the horse and sheass or between the jackass and mare are less than between the horse and mare or the male  and female ass It is the number of conformities and dissimilarities which constitutes or distinguishes species and since the species of the ass has at all times been separated from that of the horse it is apparent that by mixing these two species whether by means of females or males we diminish the number of conformities which constitute the species Hence the males will engender and the females produce seldomer and with more difficulty and even those mixed species if their conformities were fewer would become entirely barren Mules of every kind therefore must be rare because it is only from being deprived of its natural female that any animal will intermix with a female of a different species Even when mongrel animals approach each other with some degree of warmth their produce is neither so certain nor so frequent as in pure species where the number of conformities is greater Now the produce of mixed species will be less frequent in proportion to the infecundity of the pure species from whom they proceed and the produce of animals proceeding from mixed species will always diminish in proportion as they recede from the original stock because the conformities between them and any other animal are augmented For example I am persuaded from the reasons above assigned that an intercourse between two bardeaux would be abortive Besides these animals proceed from two species which are not very fertile and are  also under the influence of the same causs which often prevent the sheass from conceiving with her own male I am more uncertain with regard to the sterility of  mules  properly so called because they are not liable to the last cause of barrenness for as the mare conceives more easily than the sheass and the jackass is more ardent than the horse their respective prolific powers are greater and their produce not so rare as that of the sheass and horse The mules of course will be less barren than the bardeaux I suspect however that two mules never engender and I presume even from the examples of fertile mules that they owe their impregnation to the ass rather than to the mule for we ought not to regard the hemule as the natural male of the shemule though they both have the same name or rather differ only in sex  To explain this matter let us suppose an order of kindred in species like that which takes place in families The horse and mare will be brother and sister in species and parents in the first degree It is the same with the male and female ass But if the male ass is given to the mare they are only counsins in species or kindred in the second degree The mule produced by them participating one half of both species will be removed to the third degree of kindred Hence the male and female mule though proceeding from the same father and mother instead of being brother and sister in species are  only kindred in the fourth degree and of course will produce more difficultly between themselves than the jackass and mare who are kindred species in the second degree For the same reason the male and female mules will not produce so easily between themselves as with the mare or ass because the kindred of the latter in species is only in the third degree while that of the former is in the fourth degree The infecundity which appears in the second degree should be more conspicuous in the third and perhaps absolute in the fourth  In general kindred of species is one of those mysteries of Nature which man can never unravel without a long continued and difficult series of experiments How can we otherwise learn than by the union of different species of animals many thousand times repeated the degree of their kindred Is the ass more allied to the horse than the zebra Does the wolf approach nearer to the dog than the fox or jackal At what distance from man shall we place the large apes who resemble him so perfectly in conformation of body Are all the species of animals the same now that they were orginally Has not their number augmented instead of being diminished Have not the feeble species been destroyed by the stronger or by the tyranny of man the number of whom has become a thousand times greater than that of any other large animal What relations can be established between  kindred species and another kindred still better known that of different races in the same species Does not a race like the mixed species proceed from an anomalous individual which forms the original stock In the dog species there is perhaps a race so rare that it is more difficult to procreate than the mixed species proceeding from the ass and mare How many questions does this subject admit of and how few of them are we in a condition to resolve How many facts must be discovered before we can even form probable conjectures However instead of being discouraged the philosopher ought to applaud Nature even when she is most mysterious and to rejoice that in proportion as he removes one part of her veil she exhibits an immensity of other objects all worthy of his researches For what we already know ought to point out what may still be known There is no boundary to the human intellect It extends in proportion as the universe is displayed Hence man can and ought to attempt every thing He wants nothing but time to enable him to obtain universal knowledge By multiplying his observations he might foresee all the phaenomena and all the events of Nature with equal certainty as if he deduced them from their immediate causs And what enthusiasm can be more pardonable or rather more noble than to believe that man is capable by his labours to  discover all the powers and mysteries of Nature  These labours consist chiefly in making observations and experiments from which we discover new truths For example the union of animals of different species by which alone we can learn their kindred has never been sufficiently tried The facts we have been able to collect concerning this union whether voluntary or forced are so few that we are not in a condition to ascertain the existence of  jumars  This name was first given to mules said to have proceeded from the bull and mare but it has likewise been applied to denote mongrels alledged to have been procreated by the jackass and cow Dr Shaw tells us that in the provinces of Tunis and Algiers 'there is a little serviceable beast of burden called  Kumrah  begot betwixt an  ass  and a  cow  That which I saw at Algiers where it was not looked upon as a rarity was single hoofed like the ass but distinguished from it in having a sleeker skin with the tail and the head though without horns in fashion of the dam's  Shaw's Travels p    Thus we have already two kinds of jumars the one proceeding from the bull and mare and the other from the jackass and cow A third is mentioned by Merolle and is pretended to proceed from the bull and sheass  'There was a beast of burden which proceeds from  the bull and sheass and is obtained by covering the ass with a cow's skin in order to deceive the bull  Voyage de Merolle au Congo en  '  But I am equally doubtful concerning the existence of all the three kinds of jumar though I pretend not to deny the possibility of the fact I have even enumerated some facts which prove an actual copulation between animals of very different species But their embraces were ineffectual Nothing seems to be more remote from the amiable character of the dog than the brutal manners and instinct of the hog and the form of their bodies is as different as their natural dispositions I have seen however two examples of a violent attachment between a dog and a sow Even during this very summer a large spaniel discovered a violent passion for a sow which was in season They were shut up together for several days and all the domestics were witnesses of the mutual ardour of these two animals The dog exerted many violent efforts to copulate with the sow but the dissimilarity of their organs prevented their union  This fact happened in the house of M le Conte de la Feuillée in Burgundy  The same thing happened some years before  At Billy near Chanceau in Burgundy  Hence animals though of very different species may contract a strong affection to each other for it is certain that in the above examples nothing prevented the union of the dog and sow but the  conformation of their organs It is not equally certain however that if consummation had taken place production would have followed It often happens that animals of different species spontaneously unite These voluntary unions ought to be prolific since they imply that the natural repugnance which is the chief obstacle is surmounted and also a conformity between the organs No fertility however has resulted from such commixtures Of this an example recently passed before my own eyes In and some succeeding years the miller at my estate of Buffon kept a mare and a bull in the same stable who contracted such a passion for each other that as often as the mare came in season the bull covered her three or four times every day These embraces were repeated during several years and gave the master of the animals great hopes of seeing their offspring Nothing however resulted from them All the inhabitants of the place were witnesses to this fact which proves that in our climate at least the bull cannot procreate with the mare and renders this first kind of jumar extremely suspicious I have not equal evidence to oppose to the second kind which Dr Shaw says proceeds from the jackass and cow I acknowledge that though the dissimilarities in structure appear to be nearly equal in both cases the positive testimony of a traveller so well informed as Dr Shaw seems to give a greater degree of probability to the existence  of this second kind of jumar than we have for the first With regard to the third jumar proceeding from the bull and sheass I am persuaded notwithstanding the authority of Merolle that it has no more existence than the one supposed to be produced by the bull and mare The nature of the bull is still farther removed from that of the sheass than from that of the mare And the unfertility of the mare and bull which is ascertained by the above examples should apply with greater force to the union of the bull and ass  The NOMENCLATURE of APES  TO teach children and to address men are two very different tasks Children receive without examination and even with avidity the arbitrary and the real the true and the false whenever they are presented to them under the form of precepts Men on the contrary reject with contempt all precepts which are not founded on solid principles We shall therefore adopt none of those methodical distributions by which under the appellation of  Ape  a multitude of animals belonging to very different species have been huddled together in one indiscriminate mass  What I call an  ape  is an animal without a tail whose face is flat whose teeth hands fingers and nails resemble those of man and who like him walk erect on two feet This definition derived from the nature of the animal itself and from its relations to man excludes all animals who have tails all those who have prominent faces or long muzzles all those who have crooked or sharp claws and all those who walk more willingly on four than on two legs According to this precise idea let us examine how many species of animals ought to be ranked under the denomination of  ape  The antients knew only  one The  pithecos  of the Greeks and the  simia  of the Latins is a true  ape  and was the subject upon which Aristotle Pliny and Galen instituted all the physical relations they discovered between that animal and man But this ape or pigmy of the antients which so strongly resembles man in external structure and still more strongly in its internal organization differs from him however by a quality which though relative in itself is not the less essential This quality is magnitude The stature of man in general exceeds five feet that of the  pithecus  or pigmy never rises above one fourth of this height Hence if this ape had been still more similar to man the antients would have been justified for regarding it only as an  homunculus  an imperfect dwarf a pigmy capable of combating with cranes while man knew how to tame the elephant and conquer the lion  But since the discovery of the southern regions of Africa and India we have found another ape possessing this quality of magnitude an ape as tall and as strong as man and equally ardent for women as for its own females an ape who knows how to bear arms to attack his enemies with stones and to defend himself with clubs Besides he resembles man still more than the pigmy for independent of his having no tail of his flat face of the resemblance of his arms hands toes and nails to ours and of his walking constantly on end he has a kind of visage  with features which approach to those of the human countenance a beard on his chin and no more hair on his body than men have when in a state of nature Hence the inhabitants of his country the civilized Indians have not hesitated to associate him with the human species under the denomination of  Orangoutang  or  wild man  while the Negroes almost equally wild and as ugly as these apes who imagine not that civilization exalts our nature have given it the appellation of  Pongo  which is the name of a beast and has no relation to man This orangoutang or pongo is only a brute but a brute of a kind so singular that man cannot behold it without contemplating himself and without being thoroughly convinced that his body is not the most essential part of his nature  Thus we have discovered two animals the pigmy and the orangoutang to which the name of  ape  ought to be applied There is a third to which though more deformed both in relation to man and to the ape this appellation cannot be refused This animal which till now was unknown and was brought from the East Indies under the name of  gibbon  walks on end like the other two and has a flat face He likewise wants a tail But his arms instead of being proportioned to the height of his body like those of man the orangoutang or the pigmy are so enormously long that when standing on his two feet he touches the ground with his hands  without bending either his body or limbs This ape is the third and last to which the name ought to be applied In this genus he constitutes a singular or monstrous species like the race of thicklegged men said to inhabit the island of SaintThomas  See the Dissertation on the Varieties of the Human Species Vol III of this work    After the apes another tribe of animals present themselves to which we shall give the generic name of  baboon  To distinguish them more accurately from the other kinds let it be remarked that the baboon has a short tail a long face a broad high muzzle canine teeth proportionally larger than those of man and callosities on its buttocks By this definition we exclude from the baboon tribe all the apes who have no tail all the monkeys whose tails are as long or longer than their bodies and all those who have thin sharp pointed muzzles The antients had no proper names for these animals Aristotle alone seems to have pointed out one of the baboons under the name  simia porcaria  The denomination  Simia Porcaria  which is employed by no other author but Aristotle was not improperly applied to denote the baboon for I find in the works of several travellers who probably never read Aristotle the muzzle of the baboon compared to the snout of a hog Besides these animals have some resemblance in the form of their bodies  though he has given but a very imperfect idea of the animal The Italians first called it  babuino  the Germans  bavion  the French  babouin    the British  baboon  and all the modern writers of Latin  papio  We shall call it  baboon  to distinguish it from the other species which have since been discovered in the southern regions of Africa and India We are acquainted with three species of these animals The  baboon  properly so called which is found in Lybia Arabia c and is probably the  simia porcaria  of Aristotle The  mandrill  or  ribbednose  is still larger than the baboon has a violet coloured face the nose and cheeks ribbed with deep oblique furrows and is found in Guinea and in the warmest provinces of Africa The  ouanderou  which is smaller than the baboon and mandrill its body is thinner its head and face are surrounded with a kind of long bushy mane and is found in Ceylon Malabar and other southern regions of India Thus we have properly defined three species of apes and three species of baboons which are all very different from one another  But as Nature knows none of our definitions as she has not classed her productions by bundles or genera and as her progress is always gradual and marked by minute shades some intermediate animal should be found between the ape and baboon This intermediate species actually exists and is the animal which we call  magot  or the  Barbary ape  It occupies a middle station between our two definitions It forms the shade between the apes and baboons It differs from  the first by having a long muzzle and large canine teeth and from the second because it actually wants the tail though it has an appendix of skin which has the appearance of a very small tail Of course it is neither an ape nor a baboon but at the same time partakes of the nature of both This animal which is very common in Higher Egypt as well as in Barbary was known to the antients The Greeks and Romans called it  cynocephalus  because its muzzle resembled that of a dog Let us now arrange these animals in their proper order The  orangoutang  is the first ape the  pigmy  the second and the  gibbon  though different in figure the third the  cynocephalus  or  magot  the fourth ape or the first baboon the  papio  is the first baboon the  mandrill  the second and the  ouanderou  or little baboon the third This order is neither arbitrary nor fictitious but agreeable to the scale of Nature  After the apes and baboons come the  guenons  or  monkeys  that is animals resembling the apes and baboons but which have tails as long or longer than their bodies The word  guenon  has for some ages had two acceptations different from that we have here given it It is generally employed to signify small apes and sometimes to denote the female of the ape But more antiently we called  singes  or  magots  the apes without a tail and  guenons  or  mones  those which had long tails This fact appears from the  works of some travellers  In Senegal there are several species of apes as the  guenons  with a long tail and the  magots  who have no tail  Voyage de le Maire    p  In the mountains of South America there is a kind of  mones  or longtailed monkeys which the savages call  cacuyen  They are of the same size with the common kind from which they differ only by having a beard on their chinAlong with these  mones  there are found a number of small yellow animals called  sagouins    Singularités da la Fr Antarct par Thevet    p    in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries The word  guenon  is probably derived from  kébos  or  képos  which the Greeks employed to denote the longtailed apes These  kébes  or  guenons  are smaller and weaker than the apes and baboons They are easily distinguishable from one another by this difference and particularly by their long tail With equal ease they may be distinguished from the  makis  or  maucaucos  because they have not a sharp muzzle and instead of six cutting teeth like the makis they have only four like the apes and baboons We know eight species of guenons and to prevent confusion we shall bestow on each a proper name The  macaque  or harelipped monkey The  patas  or red monkey The  malbrouk  The  mangabey  or monkey with the upper eyelids of a pure white colour The  mone  or varied monkey The  callitrix  or green monkey The  moustac  or whiskered monkey The  talapoin  The  douc  or monkey of Cochinchina The antient Greeks knew only two of these  guenons    or longtailed monkeys namely the mone and the callitrix who are natives of Arabia and the northern parts of Africa They had no idea of the other kinds because these are only found in the southern provinces of Africa and the East Indies countries entirely unknown in the days of Aristotle This great philosopher and the Greeks in general were too wise to confound beings by common and therefore equivocal names They called the ape without a tail  pithecos  and the monkey with a long tail  kébos  As they knew these animals to be distinct species they gave to each a proper name derived from their most striking characters All the apes and baboons which they knew namely the  pigmy  the  cynocephalus  or  magot  and the  simia porcaria  or  papio  have their hair nearly of a uniform colour But the monkey which we have called  mone  and the Greeks  kébos  has hair of different colours and is generally known by the name of the  varied ape  This species of monkey was most common and best known in the days of Aristotle and from its most distinguished character he called it  kébos  which in Greek signifies  varieties in colour  Thus all the animals belonging to the class of apes baboons and monkeys mentioned by Aristotle are reduced to four the  pithecos  the  cynocephalos  the  simia porcaria  and the  kébos  which we believe to be the  pigmy  the  magot  or Barbary ape the  baboon  and the  mone  or varied monkey not  only because they agree with the characters given of them by Aristotle but likewise because the other species must have been unknown to the antients since they are natives of countries into which the Greek travellers had never penetrated  Two or three centuries after Aristotle we find in the Greek writers two new names  callithrix  and  cercopithecos  both relative to the  guenons  or longtailed monkeys In proportion as discoveries were made of the southern regions of Africa and Asia we found new animals and other species of monkeys And as most of these monkeys had not like the  kébos  various colours the Greeks invented the generic name  cercopithecos  or  tailed ape  to denote all the species of monkeys or apes with long tails and having remarked among these new species a monkey with hair of a lively greenish colour they called it  callithrix  which signifies  beautiful hair  This callithrix is found in the south part of Mauritania and in the neighbourhood of Cape de Verd and is commonly known by the name of the  green ape  With regard to the other seven species of monkeys mentioned above under the appellations of  makaque    patas    malbrouk    mangabey    moustac    talapoin  and  douc  they were unknown to the Greeks and Latins The makaque is a native of Congo the patas of Senegal the mangabey of Madagascar the malbrouk of Bengal the moustac of Guinea the talapoin of Siam  and the douc of Cochinchina All these territories were equally unknown to the antients  As the progress of Nature is uniform and gradual we find between the baboons and monkeys an intermediate species like that of the magot between the apes and baboons The animal which fills this interval has a great resemblance to the monkeys particularly to the makaque its muzzle at the same time is very broad and its tail short like that of the baboons Being ignorant of its name we have called it  maimon  or  pigtailed baboon  to distinguish it from the others It is a native of Sumatra Of all the monkeys or baboons it alone has a naked tail and for this reason several authors have given it the denomination of the  pigtailed  or  rattailed ape  We have now enumerated all the animals of the Old World to whom the common name of  ape  has been applied though they belong not only to different species but to different genera To augment the confusion the same names of  ape    cynocephalus    kébos  and  cercopithecos  which had been invented by the Greeks fifteen centuries ago have been bestowed on animals peculiar to the New World though so recently discovered They never dreamed that none of the African or East Indian animals had any existence in the southern regions of the New Continent In America we have discovered animals with hands and fingers This similarity was alone  sufficient to procure to them the name of  apes  without considering that for the transference of a name identity of genus and even of species is necessary Now these American animals of which we shall make two classes under the appellations of  sapajous  or monkeys with prehensile tails and  sagoins  or monkeys with long tails which are not prehensile or want the faculty of laying hold of any object are very different from the apes of Asia and Africa and in the same manner as no apes baboons or monkeys are to be found in the New World there are neither sapajous nor sagoins in the Old Though we have already given a general view of these facts in our dissertation concerning the animals of both Continents we can now prove them in a more particular manner and demonstrate that of seventeen species to which all the animals of the Old World called  apes  may be reduced and of twelve or thirteen in the New World to whom this name has been transferred none of them are the same or to be found equally in both Worlds for of the seventeen species in the Old Continent three or four apes must first be retrenched who certainly exist not in America and to whom the sapajous and sagoins have no resemblance In the second place three or four baboons must likewise be retrenched They are larger than the sapajous and sagoins and also very different in figure There remain only nine monkeys with whom  any comparison can be instituted Now all these monkeys as well as the apes and baboons have general and particular characters which separate them entirely from the sapajous and sagoins The first of these characters is to have naked buttocks and natural callosities peculiar to these parts The second is to have  abajoues  or pouches under the cheeks in which they can keep their victuals The third is to have a narrow partition between the nostrils and the apertures of the nostrils themselves placed in the under part of the nose like those of man The sapajous and sagoins have none of these characters The partition between their nostrils is always very thick the apertures of their nostrils are situated in the sides of the nose and not in the under part of it They have hair on their buttocks and no callosities They have no pouches under the cheeks Hence they differ from the monkeys not only in species but in genus since they possess none of the general characters which are common to the whole tribe of monkeys This difference of genus necessarily implies greater differences in species and shows that these animals are very remote from each other  It is with much impropriety therefore that the names  ape  and  monkey  have been applied to the  sapajous  and  sagoins  We must preserve their names and instead of associating them with the apes we should begin by comparing  them with one another These two tribes differ from each other by a remarkable character All the sapajous use their tail as a finger to hang upon branches or to lay hold of any object they cannot reach with their hand The sagoins on the contrary have not the power of employing their tail in this manner Their face ears and hair are also different We may therefore separate them into two distinct genera In giving the history of the species I shall avoid all those denominations which can only apply to the apes baboons and monkeys and preserve the names they receive in their native country  We are acquainted with six or seven species of sapajous and six of sagoins most of which have some varieties We have carefully searched all the writings of travellers in order to discover the proper name of each species because the names they receive in the places they inhabit generally point out some peculiar characteristic which alone is sufficient to distinguish them from one another  With regard to the varieties which in this class of animals are perhaps more numerous than the species we shall endeavour to refer each of them to their proper kinds We have had forty of these animals alive each of which differed more or less from one another and to us it appears that the whole may be reduced to thirty species namely three apes and an intermediate species between them and the baboons  three baboons and an intermediate species between them and the monkeys nine monkeys seven sapajous and six sagoins All the others or at least most of them ought to be regarded as varieties only But as we are uncertain whether some of these varieties may not be distinct species we shall endeavour to give all of them proper names  On this occasion let us consider terrestrial animals some of which have a great resemblance to man in a new point of view The whole have improperly received the general name of  quadrupeds  If the exceptions were few we would not have found fault with the application of this name It was formerly remarked that our definitions and denominations however general never comprehend the whole that beings always exist which elude the most cautious definitions which ever were invented that intermediate beings are always discovered that several of them though apparently holding a middle station escape from the list and that the general names under which we mean to include them are incomplete because Nature should only be considered by unities and not by aggregates because man has invented general denominations with the sole view of aiding his memory and supplying the defects of his understanding and because he afterwards foolishly considered these general names as realities and in fine because he has  endeavoured to comprehend under them beings and even whole classes of beings which required different appellations I can give an example without departing from the class of quadrupeds which of all animals we are best acquainted with and of course were in a condition to have bestowed on them the most precise denominations  The name  quadruped  supposes that the animal has  four feet  If it wants two feet like the manati if it has arms and hands like the ape or if it has wings like the bat it is not a quadruped Hence this general term when applied to these animals is abused To obtain precision in words the ideas they present must be strictly true If we had a term for two hands similar to that which denotes two feet we might then say that man was the only biped and  bimanus  because he alone has two hands and two feet that the manati is a  bimonus  that the bat is only a biped and that the ape is a  quadrimanus  or fourhanded animal Let us now apply these new denominations to all the particular beings to which they belong and we shall find that from about two hundred animals who go under the common name of  quadrupeds  thirtyfive species of apes baboons monkeys sapajous sagoins and makis must be retrenched because they are  quadrimani  or fourhanded and that to these thirtyfive species the loris or tailless maucauco the Virginian murine and Mexican  opossum the Egyptian and woolly jerboa's c should be added because they are fourhanded like the apes and monkeys Thus the list of fourhanded animals being at least forty species the real number of quadrupeds is one fifth diminished We must likewise retrench twelve or fifteen species of bipeds namely the bats whose forefeet are rather wings than feet and likewise three or four jerboa's because they can walk on their hind feet only the forefeet being too short If we subtract also the manati which has no hind feet the arctic and Indian walrus and the seals to whom the hind feet are useless and if we still retrench those animals which use their forefeet like hands as the bears the marmots the coati's the agouti's the squirrels the rats and many others the denomination of  quadruped  will appear to be applied improperly to more than one half of these animals The whole and clovenhoofed are indeed the only real quadrupeds When we descend to the digitated class we find fourhanded or ambiguous quadrupeds who use their forefeet as hands and ought to be separated or distinguished from the others Of wholehoofed animals there are three species the horse the ass and the zebra If to these we add the elephant the rhinoceros the hippopotamus and the camel whose feet though terminated by nails are solid and serve the animals for walking only we shall have seven  species to which the name of  quadruped  is perfectly applicable The number of clovenhoofed animals greatly exceeds that of the wholehoofed The oxen the sheep the goats the antilopes the bubalus the lama the pacos the the giraffe the elk the raindeer the stag the fallowdeer the roebuck c are all clovenfooted and constitute about forty species Thus we have already fifty animals ten whole and forty clovenhoofed to whom the name  quadruped  is properly applied In the digitated animals the lion tiger panther leopard lynx cat wolf dog fox hyaena badger polecat weasels ferret porcupines hedgehogs armadillos anteaters and hogs which last constitute the shade between the digitated and clovenfooted tribes form a number consisting of more than forty species to which the term of  quadruped  applies with perfect precision because though their forefeet be divided into four or five toes they are never used as hands But all the other digitated species who use their forefeet in carrying food to their mouths are not in strict propriety of language quadrupeds These species which likewise amount to forty make an intermediate class between quadrupeds and fourhanded animals being neither the one nor the other Hence to more than a fourth of our animals the name of  quadruped  does not apply and to more than a half of them the application of it is incomplete  The fourhanded animals fill the interval between man and the animals and the twohanded species constitute a mean term in the distance between man and the cetaceous tribes The bipeds with wings form the shade between quadrupeds and birds and the digitated species who use their forefeet as hands fill the whole space between the quadrupeds and the fourhanded kinds But I will pursue this subject no farther However useful it may be for acquiring a distinct knowledge of animals it is still more so by affording a fresh proof that all our definitions or general terms want precision when applied to the objects or beings which they represent  But why are these definitions and general terms which appear to be the most brilliant exertions of the human intellect so defective in their application Does the error necessarily arise from the narrow limits of our understanding Or rather does it not proceed solely from our incapacity of combining and perceiving at one time a great number of objects Let us compare the works of Nature with those of man Let us examine how both operate and inquire whether the mind however acute can follow the same route without loosing itself in the immensity of space in the obscurity of time or in the infinity of related beings When man directs his mind to any object if his perceptions be accurate he takes the straight line  runs over the smallest space and employs the least possible time in accomplishing his end What an expence of thought how many combinations are necessary to avoid those deceitful and fallacious roads which at first present themselves in such numbers that the choice of the right path requires the nicest discrnment This path however is not beyond the reach of the human intellect which can proceed without deviating from the straight line The mind is enabled to arrive at a point by means of a line and if another point must be gained it can only be attained by another line The train of our ideas is a delicate thread which extends in length without any other dimensions Nature on the contrary never moves a step which extends not on all sides and runs at once through the three dimensions of length breadth and thickness While man reaches but one point Nature accomplishes a solid by penetrating the whole parts which compose a mass In bestowing form on brute matter our statuaries by the union of art and time are enabled to make a surface which exactly represents the outside of an object Every point of this surface requires a thousand combinations Their genius is directly exerted upon as many lines as there are strokes in the figure The smallest deviation would be a deformity This marble so perfect that it seems to breathe is of course only a multitude of points at which the artist arrives by a long succession of labour because human genius being unable to seize more than  one dimension at the same time and our senses reaching no farther than surfaces we cannot penetrate matter But Nature in a moment puts every particle in motion She produces forms by exertions almost instantaneous She at once developes them in all their dimensions As soon as her movements reach the surface the penetrating forces with which she is animated operate internally The smallest atom when she chooses to employ it is instantly compelled to obey Hence she acts at the same time on all sides before behind above below on the right and left and consequently she embraces not only the surface but every particle of the mass How different likewise is the product What comparison is there between a statue and an organized body How unequal at the same time are the powers how disproportioned the instruments Man can employ only the power he possesses Limited to a small quantity of motion which he can only communicate by the mode of impulsion his exertions are confined to surfaces because in general the impulsive force is only transmitted by superficial contact He neither sees nor touches more than the surfaces of bodies and when he wishes to attain a more intimate knowledge though he opens and divides still he sees and touches nothing more than their surfaces To penetrate the interior parts of bodies he would require a portion of that force which acts upon the mass or of gravity which is Nature's chief instrument If man could employ this penetrating force as  he does that of impulsion or if he had a sense relative to it he would be enabled to perceive the essence of matter and to arrange small portions of it in the same manner as Nature operates at large It is owing to the want of instruments therefore that human art cannot approach that of Nature His figures his pictures his designs are only surfaces or imitations of surfaces because the images he receives by his senses are all superficial and he has no mode of giving them a body  What is true with regard to the arts applies likewise to the sciences The latter however are not so much limited because the mind is their chief instrument and because in the former it is subordinate to the senses But in the sciences the mind commands the senses as often as it is employed in thinking and not in operating in comparing and not in imitating Now the mind though bound up by the senses though often deceived by their fallacious reports is neither diminished in its purity nor activity Man who naturally loves knowledge commenced by rectifying and demonstrating the errors of the senses He has treated them as mechanical instruments the effects of which must be submitted to the test of experiment Proceeding thus with the balance in one hand and the compass in the other he has measured both time and space He has cognised the whole outside of Nature and being unable to penetrate her internal parts by his  senses his deductions concerning them have been drawn from comparison and analogy He discovered that there exists in matter a general force different from that of impulsion a force which falls not under the cognisance of our senses and which though we are incapable of using it Nature employs as her universal agent He has demonstrated that this force belongs equally to all matter in proportion to its mass or real quantity and that its action extends to immense distances decreasing as the spaces augment Then turning his views upon living beings he perceived that heat was another force necessary to their production that light was a matter endowed with infinite elasticity and activity that the formation and expansion of organized bodies were effects of a combination of all these forces that the extension and growth of animals and vegetables follow the laws of the attractive force and are effected by an augmentation in the three dimensions at the same time and that a mould when once formed must by these laws of affinity produce a succession of other moulds perfectly similar to the original By combining these attributes common to the animal and vegetable he recognised that there existed in both an inexhaustible circulating store of organic substance a substance equally real as brute matter a substance which continues always in a live as the other does in a dead state a substance universally diffused which passes from  vegetables to animals by means of nutrition returns from animals to vegetables by the process of putrefaction and maintains a perpetual circulation for the animation of beings He perceived that these active organic particles existed in all organized bodies that they were combined in smaller or greater quantities with dead matter that they were more abundant in animals in whom every thing is alive and more rare in vegetables in which death predominates and life seems to be extinct organization being surcharged with brute matter and that plants are of course deprived of progressive motion of heat and of life exhibiting no other quality of animation but expansion and reproduction Reflecting on the manner in which these last are accomplished he discovered that every living being is a mould that has the power of assimilating the substances with which it is nourished that growth is an effect of this assimilation that the development of a living body is not a simple augmentation of volume but an extension in all dimensions a penetration of new matter through all parts of the mass that these parts by increasing proportionally to the whole and the whole proportionally to the parts the form is preserved and continues always the same till growth is completed that when the body has acquired its full expansion the same matter formerly employed in augmenting its volume is returned as superfluous from all the parts to which it had been assimilated  and by uniting in a common point forms a new being perfectly similar to the first and to attain the same dimensions requires only to be developed by the same mode of nutrition He perceived that man quadrupeds cetaceous animals birds reptiles insects trees and herbs were nourished expanded and reproduced by the same law and that the mode of their nutrition and generation though depending on the same general cause appeared to be very different because it could not operate but in a manner relative to the form of each particular species of being Proceeding gradually in this investigation he began after a sucession of ages to compare objects To distinguish them from each other he gave them particular names and to unite them under one point of view he invented general terms Taking his own body as the physical model of all animated beings he measured examined and compared all their parts and he discovered that the form of every animal that breathes is nearly the same that by dissecting an ape we may learn the anatomy of a man that taking another animal we always find the same fund of organization the same senses the same viscera the sames bones the same flesh the same motion of the fluids the same play and action of the solids In all of them he found a heart veins and arteries and the same organs circulation respiration digestion nutrition and secretion in all of them he found a solid structure  composed of the same pieces and nearly situated in the same manner This plan proceeds uniformly from man to the ape from the ape to quadrupeds from quadrupeds to cetaceous animals to birds to fishes and to reptiles This plan I say when well apprehended by the human intellect exhibits a faithful picture of animated Nature and affords the most general as well as the most simple view under which she can be considered And when we want to extend it and to pass from the animal to the vegetable we perceive this plan which had at first varied only by shades gradually degenerating from reptiles to insects from insects to worms from worms to zoophytes from zoophytes to plants and though changed in all its external parts still preserving the same character the principal features of which are nutrition growth and reproduction These features are common to all organized substances They are eternal and divine and instead of being effaced by time it only renews and renders them more conspicuous  If from this grand picture of resemblances exhibited in animated Nature as constituting but one family we pass to that of the differences where each species claims a separate apartment and a distinct portrait we shall find that with the exception of a few large kinds such as the elephant the rhinoceros the hippopotamus the tiger and the lion which ought to have particular  frames all the others seem to unite with their neighbours and to form groups of degraded similarities or genera represented by our nomeclators in a network of figures some of which are supported by the feet others by the teeth by the hair and others by relations still more minute And even the apes whose form seems to be most perfect or approaches nearest to that of man present themselves in a group and require the utmost attention to be distinguished from each other because the privilege of separate species depends less on figure than magnitude and man himself though a distinct species and infinitely removed from that of all other animals being only of a middle size has a greater number of neighbouring species than the very large kinds In the history of the orangoutang we shall find that if figure alone be regarded we might consider this animal as the first of apes or the most imperfect of men because except the intellect the orangoutang wants nothing that we possess and in his body differs less from man that from the other animals which receive the denomination of  apes  Hence mind reflection and language depend not on figure or on the organization of the body These are endowments peculiar to man The orangoutang though he neither thinks nor speaks has a body members senses a brain and a tongue perfectly similar to those of man He counterfiets every human movement but  her performs no action that is characteristic of man This imperfection is perhaps owing to want of education or to an error in our judgment You compare it may be said an ape in the woods with a man in polished society But in order to form a proper judgment of them a savage man and an ape should be viewed together for we have no just idea of man in a pure state of nature The head covered with bristly hair or with curled wool the face veiled with a long beard two crescents of hairs still grosser by their length and prominency contract the front and not only obscure the eyes but sink and round them like those of the brutes the lips thick and protruded the nose flat the aspect wild and stupid the ears the body and the members covered with hair the breasts of the female long and flabby and the skin of her belly hanging down as far as her knees the children wallowing in filth and crawling on their hands and feet the father and mother sitting squat on their hams both hideous and besmeared with corrupted grease This sketch drawn from a savage Hottentot is a flattering portrait for the distance between man in a pure state of nature and a Hottentot is greater than between a Hottentot and us But if we want to compare the ape to man we must add the relations of organization the conformities of temperament the vehement appetite of the males for the females the same structure of genitals in both sexes the  periodic courses of the female the voluntary or forced intermixture of the Negresses with the apes the produce of which has entred into both species and then consider on the supposition that they are not the same how difficult it is to perceive the interval by which they are separated  If our judgment were limited to figure alone I acknowledge that the ape might be regarded as a variety of the human species The Creator has not formed man's body on a model absolutely different from that of the mere animal He has comprehended the figure of man as well as that of all other animals under one general plan But at the same time that he has given him a material form similar to that of the ape he has penetrated this animal body with a divine spirit If he had conferred the same privilege not on the ape but on the meanest and what appears to us to be the worst constructed animal this species would soon have become the rival of man it would have excelled all the other animals by thinking and speaking Whatever resemblance therefore takes place between the Hottentot and the ape the interval which separates them is immense because the former is endowed with the faculties of thought and of speech  Who will ever be able to ascertain how the organization of an idiot differs from that of another man Yet the defect is certainly in the material  organs since the idiot is likewise endowed with a soul Now as between one man and another where the whole structure is perfectly similar a difference so small that it cannot be perceived is sufficient to prevent thought we should not be surprised that it never appears in the ape who is deprived of the necessary principle  The soul in general has a proper action totally independent of matter But as its divine Author has been pleased to unite it to the body the exercise of its particular acts depends on the state of the material organs This dependence is apparent not only from the case of idiots but from people affected with delirium from sleep from new born infants who cannot think and from very old men whom the power of thinking has forsaken It is even probable that the chief effect of education consists not so much in instructing the mind or maturing its operations as in modifying the material organs and bringing them into the most favourable state for the exercise of the sentient principle Now there are two kinds of education which ought to be carefully distinguished because their effects are extremely different the education of the individual which is common to man and the other animals and the education of the species which appertains to man alone A young animal both from natural encitements and from example learns in a few weeks to do every thing its parents  can perform To an infant several years are necessary before it acquires this degree of perfection because when brought forth it is incomparably less advanced weaker and more imperfectly formed than the smaller animals In early infancy the mind is nothing when compared to the powers it will afterwards acquire In receiving individual education therefore the infant is much slower than the brute but for this very reason it becomes susceptible of that of the species The multiplicity of succours the continual cares which this state of imbecillity for a long time requires cherish and augment the attachment of the parents In training the body they cultivate the mind The time employed in strengthening the former gives an advantage to the latter The bodily powers of most animals are more advanced in two months than those of the infant in two years Hence the time employed in bestowing on the infant its individual education is as twelve to one without estimating the fruits of what follows after this period without considering that animals separate from their parents as soon as they can provide for themselves and that not long after this separation they know each other no more All education ceases the moment that the aid of the parents become unnecessary This time of education being so short its effects must be very limited It is even astonishing that the animals acquire in two months all that is necessary for  them during the rest of life If we suppose that a child in an equal period were strong enough to quit his parents and never return to them would there be any perceptible difference between this infant and a brute However ingenious the parents they would not have time sufficient to modify and prepare his organs or to establish the smallest communication of thought between their minds and his They could not excite his memory by impressions frequently enough reiterated They could not even mollify or unfold the organs of speech Before a child can pronounce a single word his ears must be struck many thousand times with the same sound and before he can make a proper application of it the same combination of the word and the object to which it relates must be many thousand times presented to him Education therefore which alone can develope the powers of the mind must be uninterruptedly continued for a long time If stopt not at two months as in the animals but even at the age of one year the mind of the infant having received no instruction would remain inactive like that of the idiot the defect of whose organs prevents the reception of knowledge This reasoning would acquire redoubled strength if the infant were born in a pure state of nature if it were confined to the sole tutorage of a Hottentot mother and were enabled by its bodily powers to separate from her at the age of two months would it not  sink below the condition of the idiot and with regard to its material part be entirely levelled with the brutes But in this condition of nature the first education requires an equal time as in the civilized state for in both the infant is equally feeble and equally slow in its growth and consequently demands the care of its parents during an equal period In a word if abandoned before the age of three years it would infallibly perish Now this necessary and so long continued intercourse between the mother and child is sufficient to communicate to it all that she possesses And though we should falsely suppose that a mother in a state of nature possesses nothing not even the faculty of speech would not this long intercourse with her infant produce a language Hence a state of pure nature in which man is supposed neither to think nor speak is imaginary and never had an existence This necessity of a long intercourse between parents and children produces society in the midst of a desert The family understand each other both by signs and sounds and this first ray of intelligence when cherished cultivated and communicated unfolds in process of time all the germs of cogitation As this habitual intercourse could not subsist so long without producing mutual signs and sounds these signs and sounds always repeated and gradually engraven on the memory of the child would become permanent expressions The catalogue of words though  short forms a language which will soon extend as the family augments and will always follow in its improvement the progress of society As soon as society begins to be formed the education of the infant is no longer individual since the parents communicate to it not only what they derive from Nature but likewise what they have received from their progenitors and from the society to which they belong It is no longer a communication between detached individuals which as in the animals would be limited to the transmission of simple faculties but an institution of which the whole species participate and whose produce constitutes the basis and bond of society  Even among brute animals though deprived of the sentient principle those whose education is longest appear to have most intelligence The elephant which takes the longest time in acquiring its full growth and requires the succour of its mother during the whole first year of its existence is also the most intelligent of all animals The Guineypig which is full grown and capable of generating at the age of three weeks is for this reason alone perhaps one of the most stupid species With regard to the ape whose nature we are endeavouring to ascertain however similar to man he is so strongly marked with the features of brutality that it is distinguishable from the moment of his birth He is then proportionally stronger and better formed  than the infant He grows faster The support of his mother is only necessary for a few months His education is purely individual and consequently as limited as that of the other animals  Hence the ape notwithstanding his resemblance to man is a brute and instead of approaching our species holds not the first rank among the animals because he is by no means the most intelligent The relation of corporeal resemblance alone has given rise to the prejudice in favour of the great faculties of the ape He resembles man it has been said both externally and internally and therefore he must not only imitate us but do every thing which we perform We have seen that all the actions which ought to be denominated  human  are relative to society that they depend at first on the mind and afterwards on education the physical principle of which is the long intercourse that necessarily subsists between the parents and children that in the ape this intercourse is very short that like the other animals he receives only an individual education and that he is not susceptible of that of the species Of course he can perform no human actions since no action of the ape has the same principle or the same design With regard to imitation which appears to be the most striking character of the apekind and which the vulgar have attributed to him as a peculiar talent before we decide it is necessary to inquire whether this imitation be spontaneous or forced Does the ape imitate us from inclination  or because without any exertion of the will he feels the capacity of doing it I appeal to all those who have examined this animal without prejudice and I am convinced that they will agree with me that there is nothing voluntary in this imitation The ape having arms and hands uses them as we do but without thinking of us The similarity of his members and organs necessarily produces movements and sometimes successions of movements which resemble ours Being endowed with the human structure the ape must move like man But the same motions imply not that he acts from imitation Two bodies which receive the same impulse two similar pendulums or machines will move in the same manner But these bodies or machines can never be said to intimate each other in their motions The ape and the human body are two machines similarly constructed and necessarily move nearly in the same manner But parity is not imitation The one depends on matter and the other on mind Imitation presupposes the design of imitating The ape is incapable of forming this design which requires a train of thinking and consequently man if he inclines can imitate the ape but the ape cannot even incline to imitate man  This parity is only the physical part of imitation and by no means so complete as the similitude from which however it proceeds as an immediate effect The ape has a greater resemblance  to us in his body and members than in the use he makes of them By observing him attentively we easily perceive that all his movements are brisk intermittent and precipitous and that in order to compare them with those of man we must adopt another scale or rather a different model All the actions of the ape are derived from his education which is purely animal To us they appear ridiculous inconsequent and extravagant because by referring them to our own we assume a false scale and a deceitful mode of measuring As his nature is vivacious his temperament warm his dispositions petulant and none of his affections have been softened or restrained by education all his habitudes are excessive and resemble more the movements of a maniac than the actions of a man or even of a peaceable animal It is for this reason that we find him indocile and that he receives with difficulty the impressions we wish to make on him He is insensible to caresses and is rendered obedient by chastisement alone He may be kept in captivity but not in a domestic state Always melancholy stubborn repugnant or making grimaces he may be said to be rather conquered than tamed The species of course have never been rendered domestic in any part of the world and consequently is farther removed from man than most other animals For docility implies some analogy between the giver and the receiver of instruction  It is a relative quality which cannot be exerted but when there is a certain number of common faculties on both sides that differ only between themselves because they are active in the master and passive in the scholar Now the passive qualities of the ape have less relation to the active qualities of man than those of the dog or elephant who require no more than good treatment to communicate to them the delicate and gentle sensations of faithful attachment voluntary obedience grateful service and unreserved devotion  In relative qualities therefore the ape is farther removed from the human race than most other animals His temperament is also very different Man can inhabit every climate He lives and multiplies in the northern as well as the southern regions of the earth But the ape exists with difficulty in temperate countries and can multiply only in those which are warm This difference of temperament implies others in organization which though concealed are not the less real It must likewise have a great influence on his natural dispositions The excess of heat which is necessary to the constitution and vigour of this animal renders all his qualities and affections inordinate No other cause is requisite to account for his petulance his salaciousness and his other passions which appear to be equally violent and disorderly  Thus the ape which philosophers as well as the vulgar have regarded as a being difficult to define and whose nature was at least equivocal and intermediate between that of man and the animals is in fact nothing but a real brute endowed with the external mark of humanity but deprived of thought and of every faculty which properly constitutes the human species a brute inferior to many others in his relative powers and still more essentially different from the human race by his nature his temperament and the time necessary to his education gestation growth and duration of life that is by all the real habitudes which constitute what is called  Nature  in a particular being  The ORANG OUTANGS or the PONGO  In the East Indies this animal is called

a man hair on the head longer than on the body body and limbs covered with reddish and shaggy hair longest hair on the back thinnest on the fore parts face and paws swarthy buttocks covered with hair    WE shall give the history of these two animals under one article because it is not improbable they belong to the same species  Of all the apes they have the greatest resemblance to man and consequently deserve particular attention We have seen the small orangoutang or jocko alive and have preserved its skin But of the pongo or great orangoutang we can only give the relations of travellers If these were faithful if they were not often obscure false and exaggerated we could not hesitate in pronouncing it to be a different species from the jocko a species more perfect and approaching nearer to that of man Bontius who was chief physician of Batavia and has left us some excellent remarks on the natural history of that part of the Indies says expressly  Quod meretur admirationem vidi ego aliquot utriusque sexus erecte incedentes imprimis cujus effigiem hic exhibeo satyram femellam tanta verecundia ab ignotis fibi hominibus occulentem tum quoque faciem manibus

who seemed to have a sense of modesty who covered herself with her hand when men appeared of whom she had no acquaintance who wept groaned and seemed to want nothing of humanity but the faculty of speech Linnaeus  Homo nocturnus Homo sylvestris  Orangoutang  Bontii Corpus album incessu erectum nostro dimidio minus pili albi contortuplicati oculi orbiculati iridi pupillaque aurea Palpebrae

that the orangoutang is not deprived of this faculty that he thinks speaks and expresses himself by a kind of hissing words This author calls him  homo nocturnus  and at the same time gives such a description of him that it is impossible to ascertain whether he is a brute or a man It may however be remarked that according to Linnaeus this being whatever he is exceeds not the half of the human stature and as Bontius takes no notice of the magnitude of his orangoutang we may presume that they are the same But this orangoutang of Linnaeus and Bontius would not be the true kind which is larger than the tallest man Neither is he the jocko which I have  seen alive for though he was of the same size with that described by Linnaeus he differed in every other character I saw him frequently and I can affirm that he neither spoke nor expressed himself by hissing and that he did nothing which a well trained dog could not perform Besides he differs in almost every article from Linnaeus's description of the orangoutang and corresponds better with the  satyrus  of the same author For these reasons I suspect the truth of the description of this  homo nocturnus  I even doubt of his existence It has probably been a white Negro a Chacrelas  See vol Art  Varieties of the human species  whom the voyagers quoted by Linnaeus have superficially examined and falsely described For the Chacrelas like the  homo nocturnus  of this author have white woolly frizled hair red eyes a feeble voice c But they are men and neither hiss nor are they pigmies of thirty inches high They think and act like other men and are also of the same size  Throwing aside therefore this ill described being and supposing a little exaggeration in the recital of Bontius concerning the modesty of his female orangoutang there only remains a brute creature an ape of which we shall find more pointed information in writers of better credit Edward Tyson  The anatomy of a Pygmie  a celebrated English anatomist who has given an excellent description  both of the external and internal parts of the orangoutang tell us that there are two species and that the one he described is not so large as the other which is called  barris  The  baris  or  barris  which they describe to be much taller than our animal probably may be what we call a  drill    Tyson    anat of a pygmie    p    or  baris  by travellers and

resided in Africa from which it appeared  Sunt in Guinea simiae barba procera canaque et pexa propemodum venerabiles incedunt lente ac videntur prae caeteris sapere maximi sunt et  barris  dicuntur

also His body is full of hair but not very thick and it is of a dunnish colour He differeth not from a man but in his legs for they have no calf He goeth always upon his legs and carrieth his hands clasped on the nap of his neck when he goeth upon the ground They sleep in the trees and build shelters for the rain They feed upon fruit that they find in the woods and upon nuts for they eat no kind of flesh They cannot speak and have no understanding more than a beast The people of the country when they travel in the woods make fires where they sleep in the night and in the morning when they are gone the Pongoes will come and sit about the sire till it goeth out for they have no understanding to lay the wood together They go many together and kill many Negroes that travail in the woods Many times they fall upon the elephants which come to feed where they be and so beat them with their clubbed fists and pieces of wood  that they will run roaring away from them Those Pongoes are never taken alive because they are so strong that ten men cannot hold one of them but yet they take many of their young ones with poisoned arrows The young Pongo hangeth on his mother's belly with his hands fast clasped about her so that when the country people kill any of the females they take the young one which hangeth fast upon his mother  Purchas's Pilgrimes part p  ' It is from this explicit passage that I have derived the names  pongo  and  jocko  Battel farther remarks that when one of these animals dies the others cover his body with branches and leaves of trees Purchas adds in a note that in the conversations he had with Battel he learned that a pongo carried off a young Negro from him who lived a whole year in the society of these animals that on his return the Negro said that they had never injured him that they were generally as tall as a man but much thicker and that they were nearly double the volume of an ordinary man Jobson assures us that in places frequented by these animals he saw a kind of habitations composed of interlaced branches of trees which would at least protect them from the scorching rays of the sun  Hist gen des Voyages tom p  'The apes of Guiney' says Bosman  Voyage de Guinée p  'which are called  smitten  by the Flemish  are of a yellow colour and grow to a great size I saw with my eyes one which was five feet high These apes have an ugly appearance as well as those of another species perfectly similar in every respect except that four of them would hardly be as large as one of the former kind They are capable of being taught almost every thing we choose' Gauthier Schoutten remarks  Voyage de Gaut Schoutten  'that the apes called  orangoutangs  by the Indians are nearly of the same figure and size with men only their back and reins are covered with hair though there is no hair on the fore part of their bodies that the females have two large breasts that their visage is coarse their nose flat and even sunk and their ears like those of men that they are robust and active that they defend themselves against armed men that they are passionately fond of women who cannot pass through the woods without being suddenly attacked and ravished by these apes' Dampier Froger and other travellers assure us that the orangoutangs carry off girls of eight or ten years of age to the tops of trees and that it is extremely difficult to rescue them To these testimonies we may add that of M de la Brosse who assures us in his voyage to Angola in the year that the orangoutangs which he calls  quimpezés  'endeavour to surprise the Negresses  whom they detain for the purpose of enjoying them and entertain them plentifully I knew a Negress at Loango who remained three years with these animals They grow from six to seven feet high They erect huts and use bludgeons in their own defence They have flat faces broad flat noses flat ears skins clearer than those of Molattoes long thinly scattered hairs in several parts of their bodies bellies extremely tense and flat heels raised behind about half an inch They walk upon two or four feet at pleasure We purchased two young ones a male of fourteen months of age and a female of twelve' c  We have thus enumerated the most certain facts we could collect concerning the great  orangoutang  or  pongo  and as magnitude is the chief character by which it differs from the jocko I persist in thinking that they are of the same species For two circumstances are at least possible The jocko may be a permanent variety a race much smaller than that of the pongo In fact they both inhabit the same climate they live in the same manner and of course ought to resemble each other in every article since they both receive equally the influences of the same soil and sky In the human species have we not an example of a similar variety The Laplander and Fin though they live under the same climate differ nearly as much in stature  and much more in other qualities than the jocko differs from the great orangoutang The jocko or small orangoutang which we have seen alive as well as those of Tulpius Tyson and others which have been brought to Europe were all perhaps young animals who had acquired only a part of their growth The one I saw was about two feet and a half high and the Sieur Nonfoux to whom it belonged assured me that it exceeded not two years of age On the supposition therefore that its growth were proportional to that of man it might if it had lived arrived at the height of more than five feet The orangoutang of Tyson was still younger for it was only about two feet high and its teeth were not perfectly formed Those of Tulpius and Edwards were nearly of the same stature with the one I saw Hence it is probable that these young animals if possessed of liberty in their own climate would have acquired with age the same height and dimensions which travellers have ascribed to the great orangoutang Of course till better information be received we must regard these two animals as constituting but one species  The orangoutang which I saw walked always on two feet even when carrying things of considerable weight His air was melancholy his gate grave his movements measured his dispositions gentle and very different from those of other apes He had neither the impatience  of the Barbary ape the maliciousness of the baboon nor the extravagance of the monkeys It may be alledged that he had the benefit of instruction but the other apes which I shall compare with him were educated in the same manner Signs and words were alone sufficient to make our orangoutang act But the baboon required a cudgel and the other apes a whip for none of them would obey without blows I have seen this animal present his hand to conduct the people who came to visit him and walk as gravely along with them as if he had formed a part of the company I have seen him sit down at table unfold his towel wipe his lips use a spoon or a fork to carry the victuals to his mouth pour his liquor into a glass and make it touch that of the person who drank along with him When invited to take tea he brought a cup and saucer placed them on the table put in sugar poured out the tea and allowed it to cool before he drank it All these actions he performed without any other instigation than the signs or verbal orders of his master and often of his own accord He did no injury to any person He even approached company with circumspection and presented himself as if he wanted to be caressed He was very fond of dainties which every body gave him And as his breast was diseased and he was afflicted with a teazing cough this quantity of sweetmeats undoubtedly contributed to shorten his life He lived one  summer in Paris and died in London the following winter He eat almost every thing but preferred ripe and dried fruits to all other kinds of food He drank a little wine but spontaneously left it for milk tea or other mild liquors Tulpius

good description and a figure of one of these animals that had been presented to Frederick Henry Prince of Orange makes nearly the same observations with regard to it as I have already related But if we wish to distinguish the instincts peculiar  to this animal from the improvement it receives by education we must compare the facts of which we have been eyewitnesses with the relations of travellers who have seen it in a state of nature in the full possession of liberty and in captivity M de la Brosse who purchased from a Negro two orangoutangs whose age exceeded not twelve months does not say that they had been instructed by the Negro It appears on the contrary that they spontaneously performed most of the actions above recited  'These animals' he remarks 'have the instinct of sitting at table like men They eat every kind of food without distinction They use a knife a fork or a spoon to cut or lay hold of what is put on their plate They drink wine and other liquors We carried them aboard At table when they wanted any thing they made themselves be understood to the cabbinboy And when the boy refused to give them what they demanded they sometimes became enraged seized him by the arm bit and threw him down The male was seized with sickness in the road He made himself be attended as a human being He was even bled twice in the right arm And whenever he found himself afterwards in the same condition he held out his arm to be bled as if he knew that he had formerly received benefit from that operation'  Henry Gross informs us vol pag  That some places towards the hills are covered with immense impenetrable forests that afford a shelter for wild beasts of all sorts But in that which forms the inland boundary of the Carnatic Rajah's dominions there is one singular species of creatures of which I had heard much in India and of the truth of which the following fact that happened some time before my arrival there may serve for an attestation  Vancajee a merchant of that country and an inhabitant on the sea coast sent up to Bombay to the then governour of it Mr Horne a couple of those creatures before mentioned as a present by a coasting vessel of which one Captain Boag was the master and the make of which according to his description and that of others was as follows  They were scarcely two feet high walked erect and had perfectly an human form They were of a sallow white without any hair except in those parts that it is customary for mankind to have it By their melancholy they seemed to have a rational sense of their captivity and had many of the human actions They made their bed very orderly in the cage in which they were sent up and on being viewed would endeavour to conceal with their hands those parts that modesty forbids manifesting The joints of their knees were not reentering like those of monkeys but saliant  like those of men a circumstance they have if I mistake not in common with the orangoutangs in the eastern parts of India in Sumatra Java and the Spiceislands of which these seem to be the diminutives though with nearer approaches of resemblance to the human species But though the navigation from the Carnatic coast to Bombay is of a very short run of not above six or seven degrees whether the sea air did not agree with them or that they could not brook their confinement or that Captain Boag had not properly consulted their provision the female sickening first died and the male giving all the demonstrations of grief seemed to take it to heart so that he refused to eat and in two days after followed her The Captain on his return to Bombay reporting this to the governour was by him asked What he had done with the bodies He said he had flung them over board Being further asked why he did not keep them in spirits He replied bluntly that he did not think of it Upon this the governour wrote afresh to Vancajee and desired him to procure another couple at any rate as he should grudge no expence to be master of such a curiosity Vancajee's answer was he should very willingly oblige him but that he was afraid it would not be in his power That these creatures came from a forest about seventy leagues up the country where the inhabitants would sometimes  catch them on the skirts of it but that they were so exquisitely cunning and fly that this scarcely happened once in a century  Francis Pyrard  Voyages de François Pyrard tom p  relates  'That in the province of Sierra Leona there is a species of animals called  baris  who are strong and well limbed and so industrious that when properly trained and fed they work like servants that they generally walk on the two hind feet that they pound any substances in a mortar that they go to bring water from the river in small pitchers which they carry full on their heads But when they arrive at the door if the pitchers are not soon taken off they allow them to fall and when they perceive the pitcher overturned and broken they weep and lament  Father Jarric quoted by Nieremberg  Euf Nieremberg Hist Nat peregrin lib cap  says the same thing nearly in the same terms With regard to the education of these animals the testimony of Schoutten  Voyages de Guat Schoutten aux Indes Orientales  accords with that of Pyrard  'They are taken' he remarks 'with snares taught to walk on their hind feet and to use their fore feet as hands in performing different operations as rinsing glasses carrying drink round the company turning a spit' c 'I saw at Java' says Guat  Voyages de Fr le Guat tom p  'a very extraordinary ape It was a female She  was very tall and often walked erect on her hind feet On these occasions she concealed with her hands the parts which distinguish the sex Except the eyebrows there was no hair on her face which pretty much resembled the grotesque female faces I saw among the Hottentots at the Cape She made her bed very neatly every day lay upon her side and covered herself with the bedclothes When her head ached she bound it up with a handkerchief and it was amusing to see her thus hooded in bed I could relate many other little articles which appeared to be extremely singular But I admired them not so much as the multitude because as I knew the design of bringing her to Europe to be exhibited as a shew I was inclined to think that she had been taught many of these monkeytricks which the people considered as being natural to the animal She died in our ship about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope The figure of this ape had a very great resemblance to that of man' c Gemelli Carreri tells us that he saw one of these apes which cried like an infant walked upon its hind feet and carried a matt under its arm to lie down and sleep upon These apes he adds appear in some respects to have more sagacity than men For when the fruits on the mountains are exhausted they come down to the sea coasts where they feed  upon carbs oysters and other shellfishes There is a species of oyster called  taclovo  which weighs several pounds and commonly lies open on the shore The ape when he wants to eat one of them being afraid left it should close on his paw puts a stone into the shell which prevents it from shutting and then eats the oyster at his ease  'The apes along the banks of the river Gambia' says Froger 'are larger and more mischieveous than in any part of Africa The Negroes dread them and cannot travel alone in the country without running the hazard of being attacked by these animals who often present them with a stick and force them to fight I have heard the Portuguese say that they have often seen them hoist up young girls about seven or eight years old into trees and that they could not be wrested from them without a great deal of difficulty The most part of the Negroes imagine them to be a foreign nation come to inhabit their country and that they do not speak for fear of being compelled to work'  'We might dispense' another traveller  Descript historique du royaume de Macacar p  remarks 'with seeing a number of apes at Macacar because a rencounter with them is often fatal It is necessary to be always well armed to defend ourselves against their attacks  They have no tail and walk always erect on their two hind feet like men'  These are nearly all the facts concerning this animal which have been related by voyagers who are least credulous and deserve most credit I have quoted the passages entire because every article is important in the history of a brute which has so great a resemblance to man And that we may be enabled to ascertain the nature of this animal with the greater precision we shall now mark the differences and conformities which make him approach or recede from the human species He differs from man externally by the flatness of his nose by the shortness of his front and by his chin which is not elevated at the base His ears are proportionally too large his eyes too near each other and the distance between his nose and mouth is too great These are the only differences between the face of an orangoutang and that of a man With regard to the body and members the thighs are proportionally too short the arms too long the fingers too small the palm of the hands too long and narrow and the feet rather resemble hands than the human foot The male organs of generation differ not from those of man except that the prepuce has no  fraenum  The female organs are extremely similar to those of a woman  The orangoutang differs internally from the human species in the number of ribs Man has only twelve but the orangoutang has  thirteen The vertebrae of the neck are also shorter the bones of the pelvis narrow the buttocks flatter and the orbits of the eyes sunk deeper He has no spinal process on the first vertebra of the neck The kidneys are rounder than those of man and the ureters have a different figure as well as the bladder and gallbladder which are narrower and longer than in the human species All the other parts of the body head and members both external and internal so perfectly resemble those of man that we cannot make the comparison without being astonished that such a similarity in structure and organization should not produce the same effects The tongue and all the organs of speech for example are the same as in man and yet the orangoutang enjoys not the faculty of speaking the brain has the same figure and proportions and yet he possesses not the power of thinking Can there be a more evident proof than is exhibited in the orangoutang that matter alone though perfectly organized can produce neither language nor thought unless it be animated by a superior principle Man and the orangoutang are the only animals who have buttocks and calfs of the legs and who of course are formed for walking erect the only animals who have a broad chest flat shoulders and vertebrae of the same structure and the only animals whose brain heart lungs liver spleen stomach and intestines are perfectly similar  and who have an appendix vermiformis or blindgut In fine the orangoutang has a greater resemblance to man than even to the baboons or monkeys not only in all the parts we have mentioned but in the largeness of the face the figure of the cranium of the jaws of the teeth and of the other bones of the head and face in the thickness of the fingers and thumb the figure of the nails and the number of vertebrae and lastly in the conformity of the articulations the magnitude and figure of the rotula sternum c Hence as there is a greater similarity between this animal and man than between those creatures which resemble him most as the Barbary ape the baboon and monkey who have all been designed by the general name of  apes  the Indians are to be excused for associating him with the human species under the denomination of  orangoutang  or  wild man  As some of the facts we have related may appear suspicious to those who never saw this animal we shall support them by the authority of two celebrated anatomists Tyson  The orangoutang has a greater resemblance to man than to the apes or monkeys because The hairs on his shoulders are directed downward and those of the arms upward His face is broader and flatter than that of the apes The figure of his ear has a greater resemblance to that of man except the cartilaginous part which is thin as in the apes His fingers are proportionally thicker than those of the apes He is in every article formed for walking erect which is by no means the case with the apes and monkeys He has thicker buttocks than all the other apes He has calfs to his legs His breast and shoulders are broader than those of the apes His heel is longer He has a cellular membrane placed as in man under the skin His peritonaeum is entire and not pierced or lengthened as it is in the apes His intestines are longer than those of the apes The intestinal canal is of different diameters as in man and not equal or nearly equal as in the apes His caecum has a vermicular appendix as in man but this appendix is wanting in all the other apes Besides the neck of the colon is not so long as that of the apes The insertions of the biliary and pancreatic ducts have but one common orifice in man and the orangoutang but in the monkeys these insertions are two inches asunder The colon is longer than that of the apes The liver is not divided into lobes as in the apes but entire as in man The biliary vessels are the same as in man The spleen and the pancreas are the same The number of lobes in the lungs is the same The pericardium is attached to the diaphragm as in man The cone of the heart is blunter than in the apes He has no pouches at the bottom of the cheeks as the other apes and monkeys have His brain is larger than that of the apes and exactly formed like the human brain The cranium is rounder and double the size of that of the monkeys All the sutures of the cranium are similar to those of man and the bones called  ossa triquetra Wormiana  are found in the lambdoid future which is not the case in the other apes or monkeys He has the  os cribriforme  and the  crista galli  which are wanting in the monkeys He has the  sella equina  exactly as in man but in the apes and monkeys this part is more elevated and prominent The processus pteregoideus is the same as in man but it is wanting in the apes and monkeys The temporal bones and those called  ossa bregmatis  are the same as in man but in the apes and monkeys these bones are of a different form The os zygomaticus is small but it is large in the apes and monkeys The teeth and particularly the dogteeth and grinders are more similar to the human teeth than to those of the apes The transverse processes of the vertebrae of the neck and the sixth and seventh vertebrae have a greater resemblance to those of man than to those of the apes and monkeys The vertebrae of the neck are not perforated as in the apes for the transmission of nerves but plain and entire as in man The vertebrae of the back and their processes are the same as in man and in the lower vertebrae there are only two inferior processes but in the apes there are four As in man there are only five lumbar vertebrae but in the monkeys there are six or seven The spinal processes of the lumbar vertebrae are straight as in man The  os sacrum  is composed of five vertebrae as in man but in the apes and monkeys it consists only of three The coccix is composed of four bones as in man and these bones are not perforated but in the apes and monkeys the coccix is composed of a greater number of bones which are all perforated In the orangoutang there are only seven true ribs  costae verae  and the extremities of the false ribs  costae nothae  are cartilaginous and articulated with the bodies of the vertebrae but in the apes and monkeys there are eight true ribs and the extremities of the false ribs are osseous and their articulations are placed in the interstices between the vertebrae The sternum of the orangoutang is as broad as that of man and not narrow as in the monkeys The bones of the four fingers are thicker than those of the apes The thigh bone is perfectly similar to that of man The rotula is round and not long single and not double as it is in the apes The heel the  tarsus  and  metatarsus  are the same as those of man The middle toe is not so long as in the apes The  obliquus inserior capitis    pyriformis  and  biceps femoris  muscles are similar to those of man but they are different in the apes and monkeys c  The orangoutang differs from the human species more than from the apes or monkeys in the following articles The thumb is proportionally smaller than that of man but it is larger than that of the other apes The palm of the hand is longer and narrower than in man He differs from man and approaches the apes by the length of his toes He differs from man by having the large toe of the foot removed nearly to the distance of an inch from the next one and he should be rather considered as a fourhanded animal than a quadruped His thighs are shorter than those of man and his arms are longer The testicles are not pendulous The epiploon is larger than in man The gallbladder is longer and narrower The kidneys are rounder than in man and the ureters are also different The bladder is longer He has no  fraenum  to the prepuce The bone in the orbit of the eye is sunk deeper He wants the two cavities below the  sella turcica  The mastoid and styloid processes are extremely small The bones of the nose are flat The  vertebrae  of the neck are short as in the apes flat before and not round and their spinal processes are not forked as in man He has no spinal process in the first  vertebra  of the neck He has thirteen ribs on each side and man has only twelve The  ossa illa  are perfectly similar to those of the apes being longer narrower and less concave than in man The following muscles are found in man and are wanting in the orangoutang  Occipitales frontales dilatatores alarum nasi seu elevatores labii superioris interspinales colli glutaei minimi extensor digitorum pedis brevis et transversalis pedis  The muscles which appear not in the orangoutang and are sometimes found in man are those called  pyramidales caro musculosa quadrata  the long tendon and fleshy body of the  palmaris  the  and  auriculam  The orangoutang has the  elevator  muscles of the clavicles like those of the apes and different from those of man The following are the muscles by which the orangoutang resembles the apes and differs from man  Longus colli pectoralis latissimus dorsi glutaeus maximus et medius psoas magnus et parvus iliacus inter nus et gastrocnemius internus  He differs from man in the figure of the  deltoides pronator radii teres et extensor pollicis brevis  Anatomy of the orangoutang by Tyson  and Cowper dissected him  with the most scrupulous exactness and have given us the results of the comparisons they made  between the different parts of his body with that of man I have translated this article from the  English that the reader may be enabled to form a judgment of the almost entire resemblance between this animal and the human species  I shall only remark for the better understanding of this note that the English are not confined like the French to a single name to denote  apes  Like the Greeks they have two denominations the one for the apes without tails which they call  apes  Simiae dividuntur in cauda carentes quae simiae simpliciter dicuntur et caudatas quae cercopitheci appellantur quae prioris generis sunt Anglice  Apes  dicuntur quae posterioris  Monkeys    Raii synops quad p    and the other for the apes with tails which they call  monkeys  The apes of Tyson could be no other than those which we denominate  pithecus  or  pigmy  and the  cynocephalus  or Barbary ape I should likewise remark that this author gives some resemblances and differences which are not sufficiently accurate  Tyson makes it peculiar to man and the orangoutang to have the hair on the shoulders directed downward and that of the arms upward The hair of most animals it is true is directed backward or downward but there are some exceptions The sloth and the least anteater have the hair of their anterior parts directed backward and that of the crupper and reins directed  forward Hence this character is of no great moment in the comparison of the orangoutang with man  In the passage quoted from Tyson I took no notice of the four first differences because they are either too slight or ill founded The first is the difference of stature which is an uncertain and gratuitous character especially as the author acknowledges that his animal was very young The second third and fourth are derived from the form of the nose the quantity of hair and other minute relations I retrenched several other differences for example the twentyfirst drawn from the number of teeth It is certain that both the human species and this animal have an equal number of teeth If the latter had only twentyeight as our author remarks it was owing to his youth and it is well known that man when young has not a greater number  The seventh difference is also very equivocal The testicles of children are situated very high and this animal being young ought not to have had them pendulous  The fortyeight mark of resemblance and the twentyfirst twentysecond twentythird twentyfourth and twentyfifth marks of difference are derived from the figure or presence of certain muscles which as they vary in most individuals of the human species ought not to be regarded as essential characters  All the resemblances and differences drawn from parts too minute as the processes of the vertebrae or derived from the position and magnitude of certain parts should only be considered as accessory characters so that the whole detail of Tyson's table may be reduced to the resemblances and differences we have pointed out  I shall mention some characters of a more general nature some of which have been omitted by Tyson and others imperfectly related Of all the apes baboons and monkeys the orangoutang alone wants those pouches within the cheeks into which they put their food before they swallow it for the inside of his mouth is the same as in man The gibbon the Barbary ape all the baboons and all the monkeys except the douc have flat buttocks with callosities on them The orangoutang alone has plump buttocks without callosities The douc likewise has no callosities but his buttocks are flat and covered with hair so that in this respect the douc forms the shade between the orangoutang and the monkeys The orangoutang alone has calfs of the legs and fleshy buttocks This single character shows that he is best formed for walking erect only his toes are very long and his heel rests with more difficulty on the ground than that of man He runs with more ease than he walks and to enable him to walk easily and long he would  require artificial heels higher than those of our shoes Though the orangoutang has thirteen ribs and man but twelve This difference does not make him approach nearer to the baboons or monkeys than it removes him from man because the number of ribs varies in most of those species some of them having twelve others eleven others ten c Hence the only differences between the body of this animal and that of man are reduced to two namely the figure of the bones of the pelvis and the conformation of the feet These are the only parts worthy of consideration by which the orangoutang has a greater resemblance to the other apes than he has to man  From this expiscation which I have made with all the exactness I was capable of a judgment may be formed concerning the orangoutang If there were a scale by which we could descend from human nature to that of the brutes and if the essence of this nature consisted entirely in the form of the body and depended on its organization the orangoutang would approach nearer to man than any other animal Placed in the second rank of beings he would make the other animals feel his superiority and oblige them to obey him If the principle of imitation by which he seems to mimic human actions were a result of thought this ape would be still farther removed from the brutes and have a greater affinity to man But as we formerly  Plate CCLII JOCKO  remarked the interval which separates them is immense and the resemblance in figure and organization and the movements of imitation which seem to result from these similarities neither make him approach the nature of man nor elevate him above that of the brutes  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The orangoutang has no pouches within his cheeks no tail and no callosities on his buttocks which last are plump and fleshy All his teeth are similar to those of man His face is flat naked and tawny His ears hands feet breast and belly are likewise naked The hair of his head descends on both temples in the form of tresses He has hair on his back and loins but in small quantities He is five or six feet high and walks always erect on his two feet We have not been able to ascertain whether the females like women are subject to periodical courses but analogy renders this matter almost unquestionable  THE PIGMY  Ape with a flattish face ears like

'that there are animals whose nature is ambiguous and are partly allied to man and partly to quadrupeds such as the  pigmies  the  kebes  and the  cynocephali  The  kebe  is a pigmy with a tail and the  cynocephalus  is perfectly similar to the pigmy except that it is larger and stronger and has a longer muzzle approaching nearly to that of the bulldog from which circumstance its name has been derived Its manners are likewise more ferocious and its  teeth are stronger than those of the pigmy and have a greater resemblance to those of the dog' From this passage it is apparent that neither the pigmy nor the  cynocephalus  mentioned by Aristotle have a tail for he says that the pigmies with tails are called  kebes  and that the  cynocephalus  resembles the pigmy in every article except the muzzle and teeth Hence Aristotle takes notice of two apes without tails the pigmy and  cynocephalus  and other apes with tails to which he gives the denomination of  kebes  Now to compare our own knowledge with that of Aristotle we shall remark that we have seen three species of apes without tails the orangoutang the gibbon or long armed ape and the magot or Barbary ape and that the pigmy is none of these three species for the orangoutang and gibbon could not be known to Aristotle since these animals are only found in the southern parts of Africa and India which were not discovered in his time besides they have characters very different from those he ascribes to the pigmy But the third species which we call the  magot  or Barbary ape is the  cynocephalus  of Aristotle for it has no tail its muzzle resembles that of a bulldog and its canine teeth are long and thick Besides this animal is common in Asia Minor and other eastern provinces which were known to the Greeks The pigmy belongs to the same country but we know it only from the relations of travellers  But though we have never been able to procure this ape its existence is equally real with that of the  cynocephalus  Gesner and Johnston have given figures of the pigmy M Brisson mentions his having seen it and he distinguishes it from the  cynocephalus  or Barbary ape which he likewise saw He confirms Aristotle's remark that these two animals resemble each other in every thing except that the  cynocephalus  has a longer muzzle than the pigmy  The first race of apes which have no tail and a short muzzle The ape I saw several apes which differed only in magnitude Their face ears and nails were very similar to those of man The hair which covered their bodies except the buttocks which are naked is a mixture of green and yellow The green predominates on the superior part of the body and the yellow on the inferior The second race of apes which have no tail and a long muzzle The  cynocephalus  differs from the ape only in having a long muzzle like that of a dog I saw several of them which had no difference but in size  Brisson regn anim p      We remarked that the orangoutang the pigmy the gibbon and the Barbary ape are the only animals to which the generic name  ape  ought to be applied because they alone want the tail and walk spontaneously and oftener on two feet than on four The orangoutang and the gibbon are very different from the pigmy and Barbary ape But as the two latter have a perfect resemblance except in the length of the muzzle and the largeness of the canine teeth the one has frequently been mistaken for the other They have always been mentioned under  the common appellation of  ape  even in languages which have one name for apes without tails and another for those which have tails In German both the pigmy and Barbary ape are called  aff  and  ape  in English It is only in the Greek language that each of these animals has a proper name  Cynocephalus  is rather an adjective than a proper substantive and for that reason we have not adopted it  From the testimony of the antients it appears that the pigmy is more mild and docile than all the other apes with which they were acquainted and that it was common in Asia as well as in Lybia and other provinces of Africa which were frequented by the Greek and Roman travellers Hence I presume that the following passages of Leo Africanus and Marmol ought to be applied to the pigmy They tell us that the apes with long tails which are shown in Mauritania and which the Africans call  mones  come from the Negro country but that the apes without tails are natives and very numerous in the mountains of Mauritania Bugia and Constantina 'They have' says Marmol 'the feet the hands and the countenance of a man and are extremely malicious and full of spirit They live upon herbs corn and all kinds of fruits They go in troops into the gardens or fields but before they leave the thickets one of them ascends an eminence from which he views the country and when he sees no person he  gives the signal by a cry for the rest to proceed and removes not from his station as long as they continue abroad But whenever he perceives any person approaching he screams with a loud voice and by leaping from tree to tree they all fly to the mountains Their flight is worthy of admiration for the females though they carry four or five young ones on their backs make great springs from branch to branch Though extremely cunning vast numbers of them are taken by different arts When wild they bite desperately but by carresses they are easily tamed They do much mischief to the fruits and corn for they gather it together in heaps cut it and throw it on the ground whether it be ripe or not and destroy more than they eat or carry off Those who are tamed perform things which are almost incredible and imitate every human action  L'Afrique de Marmol tom p  ' Kolbe relates nearly the same facts with regard to the apes of the Cape of Good Hope But from his figure and description it is obvious that these apes are baboons and have a short tail a long muzzle pointed nails c and that they are much larger and stronger than the apes of Mauritania  See below Art  Baboon  We may therefore presume that Kolbe has copied the passage from Marmol and attributed to the baboons of the  Cape the manners and dispositions of Mauritanian pigmies  The pigmy the Barbary ape and the baboon were known to the antients these animals are found in Asia Minor Arabia Upper Egypt and in all the northern parts of Africa Hence this passage of Marmol may be applied to all the three But it corresponds not with the baboon for it mentions that these apes have no tails Neither is it the Barbary ape but the pigmy of which this author treats for the Barbary ape is not easily tamed and instead of four or five it generally produces only two young But the pigmy being smaller should produce a greater number Besides it is milder and more docile than the Barbary ape who is never perfectly tamed For these reasons I am convinced that it is not the Barbary ape but the pigmy to which the passage in the above author ought to be applied The same remark is applicable to a passage of Rubruquis when mentioning the apes of Cathay he remarks 'That in every article they are fashioned like man That they are more than a foot and a half high and all covered with hair that they live in caverns that in order to seize them the natives put strong inebriating liquors in the caverns they frequent that they assemble together to drink these liquors crying  chinchin  from which they have obtained the name of  chinchin  and that after intoxicating themselves they fall  asleep when they are easily taken by the hunters' These characters correspond with the pigmy and by no means with the Barbary ape The latter we have seen alive and never heard it cry  chinchin  Besides it is much more than a foot and a half high and has not so great a resemblance to man as the author alledges We have the same reasons for applying to the pigmy the figure and remark of Prosper Alpinus He tells us that the small apes without tails which he saw in Egypt tame sooner and more easily than any other that they have likewise more sagacity and industry and are gayer and more frolicsome Now the Barbary ape is thick and of a considerable stature it is a dirty ferocious melancholy animal and is never fully tamed Hence the characters given by Prosper Alpinus to his ape without a tail apply not to the Barbary ape and can belong to no other animal than the pigmy  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The pigmy has no tail and his canine teeth are not proportionally larger than those of man He has a flat face his nails are likewise flat and rounded like those of the human species He walks on two feet and is about a foot and a half in length His disposition is mild and he is easily tamed The antients alledge that the female is subject to the menstrual discharge and analogy permits us not to doubt the fact  The GIBBON or Longarmed APE  Longarmed ape with a flat swarthy face surrounded with gray hairs hair on the body black and rough buttocks bare nails on the hands flat on the feet long arms of a disproportioned length reaching quite to the ground when the animal is erect its naturalposture of a hideous deformity  Pennant's synops of quad p    Gibbon  is the name under which M Dupleix gave us this animal which he brought from the East Indies I first imagined this to be an Indian word But I found in a note upon Piiny by Dalechamp that Strabo had denoted the  cephus  by the word  keipon  from which  guibon  or  gibbon  had probably been derived The following is the passage of Pliny with Dalechamp's note  'Pompeii Magni primum Iudi ostenderunt ex Ethiopia quas vocant  cephos  Cephos  Strabo lib  vocat esseque tradit facie satyro similem  Dal Plin Hist Nat lib    cap    Nota  It appears that the  cebus  of the Greeks and the  cephus  of Pliny which ought to be pronounced  kebus  and  kephus  may have originally come from  koph  or  kophin  the Hebrew and Chaldean name of the ape  quarum pedes posteriores pedibus humanis et cruribus priores manibus fuere similes Hoc animal postea Roma non vidit'    THE Gibbon keeps himself always erect even when he walks on four feet because his arms are as long as both his body and legs We have seen him alive He exceeded not three feet in height but he was young and in captivity Hence we may presume that he had not acquired his full dimensions and that in a natural state he might arrive at four feet He has not the vestige of a tail But he is distinguished  from the other apes by the prodigious length of his arms When standing erect on his hind feet his hands touch the ground and he can walk on his four feet without bending his body Round the face there is a circle of white which gives him a very extraordinary appearance His eyes are large but deep sunk His ears are naked His face is flat of a tawny colour and pretty similar to that of man After the orangoutang and the pigmy the gibbon would make the nearest approach to the human figure if he was not deformed by the excessive length of his arms for in a state of nature man would likewise have a strange aspect The hair and the beard if neglected would form round his countenance a circle similar to that which surrounds the face of the gibbon  This ape appeared to be of a tranquil disposition and of gentle manners His movements were neither too brisk nor precipitant He received mildly what was given him to eat He was fed with bread fruits almonds c He was afraid of cold and moisture and did not live long in a foreign climate He is a native of the East Indies and particularly of Coromandel Malacca and the Molucca islands  Father le Comte tells us that he saw in the Molucca's a kind of ape which walked naturally on two feet used its hands like a man and had a face like that of a Hottentot But the whole body was covered with a kind of gray wool It had an exact resemblance to an infant and expressed its passions and appetites in the most perfect manner He adds that these apes are extremely gentle that they show great attachment to the people with whom they are acquainted and embrace them with transport that one of them which he saw was at least four feet high and was very dexterous and agile  Mem sur la China    par Louis le Comte    p    It appears  that he is likewise found in more northern provinces and that we ought to refer to the gibbon the ape of the kingdom of Gannaura on the frontier of China to which some travellers have given the name of  fefé  In the kingdom of Gannaura on the frontier of China there is a very rare animal called  fesé  It is nearly of the human figure Its arms are very long the body is black and covered with hair and it moves lightly and very quick  Recueil des voyages    c tom    p    Nota  This character of very long arms belongs only to the gibbon and consequently indicates that the fefé is the same animal We may presume that the word  fefé  comes from  jesef  or  sesef  the name of the baboon in the provinces of Africa which border upon Arabia and that it has been transferred from the baboon to the gibbon for the arms of the baboon are not longer than those of the other apes    The gibbon varies in size and colour There are two in the royal cabinet of which the second though an adult is much smaller than the first and is brown in all the parts where the other is black But they so perfectly resemble each other in every other article that they unquestionably belong to the same species  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The gibbon has no tail There are slight callosities on his buttocks His face is flat brown and surrounded with a circle of gray hairs His canine teeth are proportionally larger than those of man The ears are naked black and round The arms are enormously long He walks on his two hind feet and is about a foot and a half or three feet high The female like women is subject to a periodical evacuation  Plate CCLIII GREAT GIBBON  Plate CCLV MAGOT  The MAGOT or BARBARY APE  Barbary ape with a long face not unlike that of a dog canine teeth long and strong ears like the human nails flat buttocks bare colour of the upper part of the body a dirty greenish brown belly of a dull pale yellow grows to above the length of four feet  Pennant's synops of quad p    Magot  the old French name of this ape which we have adopted  Momenet  according to Johnston It is likewise called

appearance of one formed by a small appendix of skin about half an inch long and situated above the anus But this appendix has no vertebrae and is only a portion of skin which adheres not more to the coccix than to the rest of the skin  the Magot agrees best with the temperature of our climate We kept one several years In summer he delighted to be in the open air and in winter he might be kept in a room without fire Though by no means delicate he was always melancholy and sometimes dirty He used the same grimaces to mark his anger or to express his appetite His movements were brisk his manners gross and his aspect more ugly than  ridiculous When agitated with passion he exhibited and grinded his teeth He filled the pouches of his cheeks with the food which was given him and generally eat every thing except raw flesh cheese and whatever had undergone a kind of fermentation When about to sleep he loved to perch upon an iron or wooden bar He was always chained because though he had been long in a domestic state he was not civilized and had no attachment to his masters He seems to have been ill educated for I have seen others of the same species more intelligent more obedient more gay and so docile as to learn to dance to make gesticulations in cadence and to allow themselves peaceably to be clothed  This ape when erect upon his two hind legs is generally two feet and a half or three feet high the female is smaller than the male He walks more willingly on four feet than on two When resting he commonly supports his body on two prominent callosities which are situated where the buttocks ought to be The anus is placed higher Hence his body is more inclined than that of a man when sitting He differs from the pigmy or ape properly so called Because his muzzle is thick and long as in the dog but the face of the pigmy is flat Because he has very long canine teeth Because his nails and fingers are neither so flat nor so round and Because he is larger more  squat and of a more ferocious and untractable disposition  There are some varieties in this species We have seen magots of different sizes and with hair more or less deeply coloured and more or less bushy It even appears that the five animals described and drawn by Prosper Alpinus under the denomination of  cynocephali  Prosper Alpin Hist Nat AEgypt lib tab fig et tab  are all magots which differ only in magnitude and in some other characters too slight to constitute distinct species It likewise appears that the species is pretty generally diffused over all the warm climates of the Old Continent and that they are found in Tartary Arabia AEthiopia Malabar  The third species of Malabarian ape is ashcoloured and has no tail or a very short one It is familiar and easily apprehends what it is taughtI received one in a present and one day I thought proper to beat it but its cries brought about me such a number of its neighbours in a wild state that to prevent accidents I restored it to liberty  Voyage du P Vincent Marie    p    Barbary Mauritania and as far as the Cape of Good Hope  It is probably this species of ape which Robert Lade mentions in the following terms 'We traversed a large mountain in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope and amused ourselves with hunting large apes which are very numerous in that placeI can neither describe all the arts practised by these animals nor the nimbleness and impudence with which they returned after being pursued by us Sometimes they allowed us to approach so near them that I was almost certain of seizing them But when I made the attempt they sprung at a single leap ten paces from me and mounted trees with equal agility from which they looked at us with great indifference and seemed to derive pleasure from our astonishment Some of them were so large that if our interpreter had not assured us that they were neither ferocious nor dangerous our number would not have appeared to be sufficient to protect us from their attacks As it could serve no purpose to kill them we did not use our guns But the Captain happened to aim at a very large one which sat on the top of a tree after having fatigued us a long time in pursuing him This kind of menace however of which the animal perhaps recollected his having sometimes seen the consequences terrified him to such a degree that he fell down motionless at our feet and we had no difficulty in seizing him But whenever he recovered from his stupor it required all our dexterity and efforts to keep him We tied his patts together But he bit so furiously that we were under the necessity of covering his head with our handkerchiefs'  Voyages by Robert Lade    Distinctive Characters of this Species  The magot has no tail though there is a small portion of skin which has the appearance of one He has cheekpouches large prominent callosities on his buttocks canine teeth proportionally longer than those of man and the under part of the face turned up like the muzzle of a bulldog He has down on his face the hair on his body is of a greenish brown colour and that on his belly is a whitish yellow He walks on the two hind feet but oftener on four He is three feet or

our figure which was drawn from the life    IN man the physiognomy is deceitful and the figure of his body gives no indication of the qualities of his mind But in the brute creation we may judge of the disposition by the aspect for every internal quality appears externally For example in looking at the apes and baboons it is easy to perceive that the latter ought to be the most savage and mischievous Their manners differ as much as their figures The orangoutang has the greatest resemblance to man and he is the most grave docile and intelligent of the whole race The Barbary ape which begins to recede from the human figure and approaches to that of the brutes by his muzzle and canine teeth is brisk disobedient and nasty The baboons who resemble man in the hands only and who have a tail sharp nails a large muzzle c have the air of ferocious beasts which they are in effect The baboon of which a figure is  here given I saw alive He was not perfectly hideous and yet he excited a degree of horror Perpetually grinding his teeth fretting and chafing with rage his owner was obliged to keep him confined in an iron cage the bars of which he moved so powerfully with his hands that he inspired the spectators with terror He is a squat animal whose compact body and nervous members indicate strength and agility He is covered with long close hair which gives him the appearance of being larger than he is in reality His strength however is so great that he would easily overcome one or several men if not provided with arms  It is to this species that the animal called  tré tré tré tré  at Madagascar ought to be referred It is as large says Flacourt as a calf of two years old It has a round head and the face of a man The fore and hind feet are like those of the ape The hair is crisped the tail short and the ears resemble those of man It is similar to the  tanach  described by Ambrose Pary It is a solitary animal and much dreaded by the natives  Voyage à Madagascar    p    Besides he is continually agitated by that passion which renders the gentlest animals ferocious He is insolently salacious affects to show himself in this situation and seems to gratify his desires  per manum suum  before the whole world This detestable action recalls the idea of vice and renders disgustful the aspect of an animal which Nature seems to have particularly devoted to such an uncommon species of impudence for in all other  animals and even in man she has covered these parts with a veil In the baboon on the contrary they are perpetually naked and the more conspicuous because the rest of the body is covered with long hair The buttocks are likewise naked and of a blood red colour the testicles are pendulous the anus is uncovered and the tail always elevated He seems to be proud of all those nudities for the presents his hind parts more frequently than his front especially when he sees women before whom he displays an effrontery so matchless that it can originate from nothing but the most inordinate desire  Papio animal ad libidinem pronum cum mulieres videt alacritatem suam ostenditPapio quem vidi vivum ad nutum haud secus atque caput reliqua animalia anum

as they are smaller and not so petulant they are taught modesty by the whip The baboon however is perfectly incorrigible and nothing can tame him  Notwithstanding the violence of their passion  these animals produce not in temperate climates The female generally brings forth but one young at a time which she carries between her arms in a manner fixed to her pap Like women she is subject to a periodical evacuation which is common to her with the other female apes who have naked buttocks These baboons though mischievous and fierce are not carnivorous They live chiefly on fruits roots and seeds  The baboons are passionately fond of raisins apples and in general of all fruits which grow in gardens Their teeth and paws render them formidable to dogs who overcome them with difficulty unless when excess of eating has made them heavy and inactiveI remarked that they neither eat fish nor flesh except when boiled or roasted and then they devour both with avidityIn their expeditions to rob orchards gardens or vineyards they generally go in troops Some of them enter the inclosure while others remain on the wall as sentinels to give notice of any approaching danger The rest of the troop are stationed without the garden at convenient distances from each other and thus form a line which extends from the place of pillage to that of their rendezvous Matters being disposed in this manner the baboons begin the operation and throw to those on the wall melons gourds apples pears c Those on the walls throw these fruits to their neighbours below and thus the spoils are handed along the whole line which generally terminates on some mountain They are so dexterous and quicksighted that they seldom allow the fruit to fall in throwing it from one to another All this is performed with profound silence and great despatch When the sentinels perceive any person they cry and at this signal the whole troop fly off with astonishing rapidity  Descript du Cap de Bonneesperance    par Kolbe    tom    p    They assemble in troops for the purpose of robbing gardens They throw the fruit from hand to hand and over the walls and they make great havock in all the cultivated lands  Plate CCLVII LARGE BABOON  Plate CCLVIII SMALL BABOON  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The baboon has cheekpouches and large callosities on his thighs which are naked and of a blood colour His tail is arched and about seven or eight inches long The canine teeth are proportionally much longer and larger than those of man The muzzle is very thick and long the ears are naked the body is massy and contracted the members are thick and short the organs of generation are naked and fleshcoloured The hair is long bushy of a reddish brown and pretty uniform over the whole body He walks oftener on four than on two feet When erect he is three or four feet high In this species there seem to be races still larger and others much smaller We have given figures both of the large and small kinds in which we can perceive no other difference but that of magnitude This difference however proceeds not from age for the small baboon appeared to be an adult as well as the large The females are subject to the menstrual discharge*  * In August a male baboon remarkable for its magnitude strength and beautiful colours was exihibited at Edinburgh It was generally thought to be a variety of the mandrill described by Gesner Buffon Ray Linnaeus and Brisson But as it differed from the mandrill of these authors in  a number of characters the Translator caused a drawing of it to be made See the plate The mandrill is said not to exceed two feet in length But this baboon when erect was near five feet high The mandrill is represented as a goodnatured though not a sportive animal This baboon on the contrary was excessively fierce presented uniformly to the spectators the most threatening aspect and attempted to seize every person who came within reach of his chain On such occasions he made a deep grunting noise and tossed up his head almost perpetually The baboon described by Buffon  presented his hind parts more frequently than his front especially when he saw women  But this baboon uniformly presented his face and allowed no person to approach him behind The Count de Buffon remarks that the mandrill is an animal of the most disgusting deformity and that he perpetually licks a snot which runs from his nose But the baboon under consideration was an animal of great beauty and had no visible distillation from his nostrils  Since writing the above Mr Pennant obligingly communicated to the Translator the proof sheet of a new and elegant edition of his excellent Synopsis of Quadrupeds in which is contained the following accurate description of this animal under the appellation of the  Great Baboon  GREAT BABOON  Papio  Gesner quad p  Simia Sphynx  Linn syst nat p  Le Choras Simia mormon  Alstroemar Schreber p    tab  MUS LEV  Baboon with hazel irides ears small

and very hairy Buttocks bare red and filthy but the space about them is of a most elegant purple colour which reaches to the inside of the upper part of the thighs  This was described from a stuffed specimen in Sir Ashton Lever's museum In October a live animal of this species was shown at Chester which differed a little in colour from the above being in general much darker Eyes much sunk in the head and small On the internal side of each ear was a white line pointing upwards The hair on the forehead turned up like a toupée Feet black in other respects resembled the former  In this I had an opportunity of examining the teeth The cutting teeth were like those of the rest of the genus but in the upper and lower jaw were two canine or rather tusks near three inches long and exceedingly sharp and pointed  This animal was five feet high of a most tremendous strength in all its parts was excessively fierce libidinous and strong  Mr Schreber says that this species lives on succulent fruits and on nuts is very fond of eggs and will put eight at once into its pouches and taking them out one by one break them at the end and swallow the yolk and white Rejects all fleshmeat unless it be dressed Would drink quantities of wine or brandy Was less agile than other baboons Very cleanly for it would immediately fling its excrements out of its hut  That which was shown at Chester was particularly fond of cheese Its voice was a kind of roar not unlike that of a lion but low and somewhat inward It went upon all fours and never stood on its hind legs unless forced by the keeper but would frequently sit on its rump in a crouching manner and drop its arms before the belly  Inhabits the hotter parts of Africa  Pennant's Synops of quad Edit    in    to    p    To this description very little can be added In the individual shown at Edinburgh which was probably the same that Mr Pennant afterwards saw at Chester the colours of the face were distinct and unmixed The ribbed cheeks were of a skyblue colour A vermilion line began a little above the eyes and running down between them and on each side of  the nose spread over the snout The inside of the ears was blue which softening from purple terminated in vermilion The beard at the roots was of the same dark brown colour with that on upper part of the body but it soon changed into a deep orange and ended in yellow The hairs on the belly were of an ashcolour and speckled like the sides of a partridge The rump was of a vermillion colour and the beautiful colours on the hips were only gradations from red to blue If it had any callosities on the buttocks they were not apparent The penis was nearly of the same red colour with the rump that of the testicles was more fiery and softened into a light blue which likewise spread over the inside of the thighsIt was very fond of the ears of wheat the grains of which it dexterously picked out one by one with its teeth  Plate CCLIX MANDRILL  Plate CCLX MANDRILL

His head is very large and his muzzle long His body is squat and his buttocks are of a blood colour His anus is conspicuous and situated almost as high as the loins His face is of a violet colour and surrounded on each side with deep longitudinal wrinkles which  augment the sullenness and deformity of his aspect He is likewise larger and perhaps stronger than the baboon but at the same time he is more peaceable and less ferocious We here give figures of both the male and the female which we have seen alive Whether they had received a better education or if they be naturally more gentle than the baboon they appeared to be more tractable and less impudent but they were equally disagreeable  This species of baboon is found on the Gold Coast and in the other southern provinces of Africa where he is called  boggo  by the Negroes and  mandrill  by the Europeans Next to the orangoutang he is the largest of all the apes or baboons Smith relates  The bodies of the mandrill when full grown are as big in circumference as a middlesized man's Their legs much shorter and their feet longer their arms and hands in proportion The head is monstrously big and the face broad and flat without any other hair but the eyebrows the nose very small the mouth wide and the lips thin The face which is covered by a white skin is extremely ugly being all over wrinkled as with old age the teeth broad and very yellow the hands have no more hair than the face but the same white skin though all the rest of the body is covered with long black hair like a bear They never go upon all four like apes but cry when vexed or teazed just like children It is said that the males often attack and use violence to the Black women wherever they meet them alone in the woods They are generally very snottynosed and take great delight in scraping it down from their noses to their mouths When I was at Skerbro one Mr Cummerbus made me a present of one of these strange animals which are called by the natives  Boggoe  It was a shecub of six months age but was then larger than a baboon  Smith's voyage to Guinea    p  In the same country this animal is called  boogoc  or  boggo  and  mandrill  and they likewise call the orangoutang  pongo  and  drill  There is much similarity in these names and they are probably derived from each other And in fact the pongo and boggo or the drill and mandrill have several common characters But the first is an ape without a tail almost naked and with a flat oval face and the second is a baboon with a tail long hair and a thick and long muzzle  Man  in the German and English languages signifies  man  in general and  drill  in the jargon of some of our French provinces denotes a  vigorous libertine  that he had a present  of a female mandrill which was only six months old and that it was as large as an adult baboon He adds that these mandrills walk always on two feet that they weep and groan like men that they have a violent passion for women which they never fail to gratify when they find a woman at a distance from relief  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The mandrill has cheekpouches and callosities on the buttocks The tail exceeds not two or three inches The canine teeth are much thicker and longer than those of man The muzzle is very thick very long and furrowed on each side with deep longitudinal wrinkles The face is naked and of a blueish colour The ears as well as the palm of the hands and soles of the feet are naked The hair is long  of a reddish brown upon the body and gray upon the breast and belly He walks on two feet oftener than on

black body and white beard and the lowando with a gray body and black beard Others of the same species are totally white    THOUGH these two animals appear to belong to the same species we have preserved to each of them the proper names they receive in Ceylon which is their native country because they constitute at least two distinct and permanent races The body of the ouanderou is covered with brown and black hairs it has a bushy head and a large beard The body of the lowando on the contrary is covered with whitish hairs and the hair on its head and beard is black In the same country there is a third race or variety which  is probably the common stock of the other two for the hair on its body head and beard is of one uniform white colour These three animals are not apes but baboons of which they have all the characters both in figure and dispositions They are wild and even ferocious Their muzzle is long their tail short and they are nearly of the same size and strength as the baboons Their bodies are indeed less squat and their hind parts seem to be more feeble That of which we have given a figure was exhibited to us under false appellations both with regard to its name and climate Its owners told us that it came from the continent of America and that it was called  cayouvassou  I soon recollected that this word  cayouvassou  is a Brasilian term which is pronounced  sajuouassou  and signifies  sapajou  and consequently that it was improperly applied since all the sapajous have very long tails But the animal under consideration is a baboon with a very short tail Besides not a single species of baboon exists in America Errors with regard to climate are very common especially among those who exhibit wild beasts When they are ignorant of the climate and the name of an animal they fail not to give it a foreign denomination which whether true or false equally serves their purpose  These baboonouanderous when not tamed are so mischievous that they must be kept in iron cages where they are frequently agitated  with vast fury But when taken young they are easily tamed and appear to be even more susceptible of education than the other baboons The Indians delight in instructing these animals and pretend that the other apes that is the monkeys have a great respect for the baboons who are possessed of more gravity and intelligence In a state of liberty  In Malabar we find four species of apes The first is all black and lustrous with a white beard which surrounds its chin and is more than a palm in length The other apes have such a respect for this species that they humble themselves in its presence as if they were conscious of its superiority The Princes and Nobles esteem those bearded apes because they appear to have more gravity and intelligence than the other kinds They are educated for ceremonies and sports in which they acquit themselves to the admiration of the spectators  Voyage du Pere Vincent Marie    p    they are extremely wild and keep perpetually in the woods  In Ceylon there are monkeys as large as our spaniels They have gray hair a black visage and a white beard which extends from the one ear to the other We meet with others of the same size but of a different colour This difference in colour appears not to alter the species for they equally receive the denomination of  ouanderous  They do little injury to the cultivated lands and generally remain in the woods where they live upon leaves and buds but when taken they eat any thing  Relation de Knox    tom    p    Hist des voyages    tom    p    If we may credit travellers those which are all white are the strongest and most mischievous They are violently fond of women strong enough to ravish them when found alone  The white apes which are sometimes of the size of the largest bulldogs are more dangerous than the black They have a great desire for women and after committing many outrages on them terminate the scene by strangling them They sometimes come to the very houses but the natives of Macacar who are extremely jealous of their wives take care to prevent the admission of such hideous gallants  Descript de Macacar    p    and often injure them so as to prove fatal  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The ouanderous has cheekpouches and callosities on the buttocks The tail is seven or eight inches in length The canine teeth are longer and larger than those of man The muzzle is thick and long The head is environed with a broad mane and a large beard of coarse hairs The body is pretty long and thin behind In this species there are races which vary in colour Some have the hair on the body black and a white beard in others the hair on the body is whitish and the beard black They walk more frequently on four than on two feet and when erect they are three or three and a half feet high The females are subject to the periodical evacuation  Plate CCLXIII OUANDEROU  The MAIMON or Pigtailed BABOON  Pigtailed baboon with a pointed face eyes hazel above and beneath the mouth some few black hairs face naked of a swarthy redness two sharp canine teeth ears like the human crown of the head dusky hair on the limbs and body brown inclining to ashcolour palest on the belly fingers black nails long and flat thumbs on the hind feet very long connected to the nearest toe by a broad membrane tail four inches long exactly like a pig's and almost naked the bare spaces on the rump red and but small length from head to tail twentytwo inches  Pigtailed monkey  Edwards    p    Simia Nemestrina semicaudata subbarbata grisea iridibus brunneis natibus calvis  Linn Syst Nat p    Brit Mus    THE apes baboons and monkeys form three tribes with intervals between each the first of which is filled by the magot and the second by the maimon The latter constitutes the link or shade between the baboons and monkeys as the magot does between the apes and baboons In effect the maimon resembles the baboons by the thickness and largeness of his muzzle and by his short arched tail but he differs from them and approaches the monkeys by the smallness of his size and the mildness of his nature Mr Edwards has given a figure and description of the maimon under the denomination of the  pigtailed ape  This peculiar character  is sufficient to distinguish him for of all the baboons or monkeys he alone has a naked slender and arched tail like that of a pig He is nearly of the size of the magot and has so strong a resemblance to the macaque or harelipped monkey that he might be regarded as a variety of this species if his tail were not totally different He has a naked tawny face chesnutcoloured eyes black eyelids a flat nose and thin lips with some stiff hairs but too short to form whiskers He has not like the apes and baboons his testicles and penis prominent and apparent the whole organs are concealed under the skin Hence the maimon though vivacious and full of fire has none of that impudent petulance peculiar to the baboons He is gentle tractable and even caressing He is found in Sumatra and probably in other southern provinces of India of course he endures with difficulty the cold of our climate The one we saw in Paris lived only a short time and that which Mr Edwards described existed only twelve months in London  The pigtailed monkey from the island of Sumatra in the Indian Sea was brought to England in the year It was extremely lively and full of action It was about the bigness of a common housecat It was a male But since I purchased this which lived a year with me I have seen a female of the same species shown in Bartholomew fair London It was larger by half than mine which I carried to compare with it They seemed highly pleased with each other's company though it was the first time of their meeting  Edwards's Gleanings    p      Plate CCLXII MAIMON  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The maimon has cheekpouches callosities on the buttocks and a naked curled up tail from five to six inches in length The canine teeth are not proportionally longer than those of man The muzzle is very large the orbits of the eyes are prominent above the face the ears the hands and the feet are naked and fleshcoloured The hair on the body is of an olive black colour and of a reddish yellow on the belly He sometimes walks on two and sometimes on four feet When erect he is two feet or two feet and a half high The female is subject to the menstrual flux  The MACAQUE or Harelipped MONKEY  Harelipped monkey with the nostrils divided like those of a hare nose thick flat and wrinkled head

the nearest approach to the baboons Like them his body is  short and squat his head and muzzle large his nose flat his cheeks wrinkled and at the same time he exceeds most of the other monkeys in size He is also extremely ugly so that he might be regarded as a small species of baboon if his tail were not long and bushy while that of the baboons in general is very short This species is a native of Congo and other southern provinces of Africa It is numerous and subject to several varieties in size in colour and in the disposition of the hair The body of that described by Hasselquist was more than two feet long and those we have seen exceeded not a foot and a half The one we have denominated  egret  because it has a crest or tuft of hair on the top of the head appears to be only a variety of the macaque which it resembles in every article except this and some other slight differences in the hair They are both of mild manners and extremely tractable But independent of a disagreeable musky odour which they both diffuse they are so dirty so ugly and so loathsome that when they make their grimaces they cannot be viewed without horror and disgust These monkeys go often in troops especially in their expeditions to rob gardens Bosman relates that they take in each paw a quantity of millet  and an equal quantity under their arms and in their mouths that they return thus loaded leaping on their hind feet and when pursued they drop the stalks which they held under their arms and in their hands preserving only what they carry in their teeth to enable them to run with more speed on their four feet He adds that they examine with the most scrupulous accuracy every stalk of millet they pull and if it does not please them they throw it on the ground and tear up others By this delicacy of choice they do more damage than by their robberies  Voyage de Bosman p    Distinctive Characters of this Species  The macaque has cheekpouches and callosities on his buttocks His tail is from eighteen to twenty inches long His head is large his muzzle very thick and his face naked livid and wrinkled His ears are covered with hair His body is short and squat and his limbs thick and short The hair on the superior parts of his body is of a greenish ashcolour and of a yellowish gray on the breast and belly He has a small crest of hair on the top of the head He walks on four and sometimes on two feet The length of his body comprehending that of the head is about eighteen or twenty inches In this species there appear to be races much larger  Plate CCLXIV MACAQUE  Plate CCLXV AIGRETTE  and others much smaller such as that of the following  The egret seems to be only a variety of the macaque He is about one third less in all his dimensions Instead of a small crest of hair on the top of the head as in the macaque the egret has an erect pointed tuft The hair on his front is black but that on the front of the macaque is greenish The tail of the egret is likewise proportionally larger than that of the macaque The females of both kinds have periodic evacuations  The PATAS  The name of this monkey in Senegal its native country It is commonly called the  red ape of Senegal  Brue found in Tabao a new species of ape of so lively a red colour that a person would have imagined it to be painted The Negroes call it  Patas    Relat de Brue    Hist gen des voyages

Pennant's Synops of quad p    or red MONKEY  THE Patas belongs to the same country and is nearly of the same size with the macaque but his body is longer his face less hideous and his hair more beautiful He is remarkable for the brilliancy of his robe which is of so vivid a red as to have the appearance of being painted We have seen two varieties of this species The first has a black line above the eyes which extends from ear to ear The second differs from the first only in the colour of this line which is white Both have long hair under the chin and round the cheeks which makes a fine beard But in the first it is yellow and in the second white This variety seems to indicate others in the colour of the hair and I am inclined to think that the monkey  mentioned by Marmol  The apes of the colour of a wild cat with a long tail and a white or black muzzle commonly called in Spain  Galospaulés  come from the Negro country  L'Afrique de Marmol    tom    p    which is of the colour of a wild cat and said to come from the Negro country is a variety of the patas  These monkeys are not equally dexterous as the other kinds and at the same time they are extremely inquisitive  'I have seen them' says Brue 'descend from the tops of the trees to the extremities of the branches in order to admire the barks as they passed They stare for some time seem to be entertained with what they have seen and then give place to those who come after They became so familiar as to throw branches at the Frenchmen who returned the compliment by the shot of their muskets Some of them sell others were wounded and the rest were struck with a strange consternation One party raised hideous cries another collected stones to throw at the enemy Some of them with their bowels in their hands attempted to throw their intrails at the spectators At last perceiving the combat to be at least equal they retired  Relat de Brue Hist gen des voyages tom p  '  It is probably of this species of monkey which le Maire speaks of in the following terms  'The havock which these monkeys make in the fields of Senegal when the millet and other grains are ripe is not to be expressed They assemble  to the number of forty or fifty One of them stands sentinel on a tree listens and looks about on all sides while the others are busy When he perceives any person he sets up loud shrieks to alarm the band who obey the

Voyage de le Maire p  '  Though in every region of Africa the species of apes baboons and monkeys are very numerous some of which are pretty similar yet it is remarked by travellers that they never

that they do not intermix and that two kinds are never seen in the same quarter  Hist gen des voyages    tom    p    Distinctive Characters of this Species  The patas has cheekpouches and callosities

monkey's tail terminates in a tuft  and CHINESEBONNET  Chinese monkey with a long smooth nose of a whitish colour hair on the crown of the head long lying flat and parted like that of a man colour a pale cinereous brown  Pennant's Synops of quad p  Rillow Knox's Celyon p  THESE two monkeys seem to be of the same species which though different in some respects from that of the Macaque makes so near an approach to it that we are doubtful whether the macaque the egret the malbrouck and the Chinesebonnet are only four varieties or permanent races of the same species As these animals produce not in our climate we cannot ascertain the identity or diversity of their species but must judge from the differences in their figure and in their external qualities The macaque and the egret are so similar that we presumed them to be one species It is the same with the malbrouck and Chinesebonnet But as the latter differ from the former more than they differ between themselves we thought it best to separate them  Our presumption with regard to the diversity of these two species is founded On the difference  in their figure On that of the colour and disposition of the hair On the different proportions in the skeletons of the two kinds and in fine on the two former being natives of the southern regions of Africa while the two latter are natives of Bengal This last consideration is of equal weight with any of the others for we have shown that in wild animals totally independent of man the distance of climate is a pretty certain indication of remoteness of species Besides the malbrouck and Chinesebonnet are not the only species or races of monkeys found in Bengal  The monkey of Calicut with grayish hair mentioned by Pyrard should probably be referred to the malbrouck species In this country the killing of monkeys is prohibited They are so importunate troublesome and numerous that they do much damage The inhabitants of the towns and villages are obliged to lattice their windows to prevent the monkeys from entering their houses  Voyages de Fr Pyrard    tom    p    It appears from the evidence of travellers that there are four varieties namely white black red and gray monkeys They alledge that the black kind are most easily tamed Those we saw were of a reddish gray colour and appeared to be tame and even docile  'These animals' travellers remark  Voyages d'Inigo de Biervillas p  'steal fruits and particularly the sugar cane One stands sentinel on a tree while the others load themselves with the booty If he perceives any person he cries  houp houp houp  with a  loud and distinct voice The moment this signal is given the whole troop throw down the canes they held in their left hand and run off on three feet When pursued hard they quit what they had in their right hand and save themselves by climbing trees which are the usual places of their abode They leap from tree to tree and even the females though loaded with their young which they hold firmly leap like the others but they sometimes fall These animals are never more than halftamed and always require a chain Even in their own country they never produce when in bondage They require to be at perfect freedom in the woods When fruits and succulent plants fail they eat insects and sometimes descend to the margins of rivers and the seacoast to catch fishes and crabs They put their tail between the pincers of the crab and whenever the pincers are closed they carry it quickly off and eat it at their leisure They gather cocoa nuts and are well acquainted with the method of extracting the juice for drink and the kernel for food They likewise drink the  zari  which drops from the  bamboos  which they place on the tops of trees in order to extract the liquors and they use it occasionally They are taken by means of a cocoa nut with a small hole made in it They put their paw into the hole with difficulty  because it is narrow and the people who are watching seize them before they can disengage themselves In the provinces of India inhabited by the Bramins who kill no animals the number of monkeys which are highly venerated is almost infinite They come in troops into the cities and enter the houses at all times with perfect freedom so that those who sell provisions and particularly fruits potherbs c have much difficulty in preserving their commodities' In Amadabad the capital of Guzarat there are three hospitals for animals where lame and sick monkeys and even those who without being diseased choose to dwell there are fed and cherished Twice every week the monkeys in the neighbourhood assemble spontaneously in the streets of the city They then mount upon the houses each of which has a small terrace or flat roof where they lie during the great heats On these two days the inhabitants fail not to lay upon these terraces rice millet sugar canes and other fruits in their season for if these animals by any accident find not their provisions in the accustomed place they break the tiles which cover the rest of the house and commit great outrages They never eat any thing without thoroughly examining it and when full they fill their cheekpouches for another occasion In places frequented by the monkeys the birds dare not build their nests on  the trees for they never fail to destroy the nests and dash the eggs on the ground  See les voyages de

islands M Adanson relates that the woods of Podor along the river Niger are filled with green apes 'I discovered apes' says he 'only by the branches they throw down from the tops of the trees for in other respects they are so silent and nimble in their gambols that it would be difficult to perceive them I killed one two and even three before the others seemed to be alarmed However after most of them were wounded they began to take shelter  some of them concealed themselves behind the large branches some descended on the ground and the greatest number sprung from the top of one tree to another During this operation I continued to shoot and in the space of twenty fathoms I killed twentythree in less than an hour and not one one of them uttered the smallest cry though they frequently assembled in troops grinded their teeth and assumed a threatening aspect as if they meant to attack me'  Voyage au Senegal    par M Adanson    p    Distinctive Characters of this Species  The callitrix has cheekpouches and callosities on the buttocks The tail is much longer than both the body and head The head is small the muzzle long and the face and ears are black Instead of eyebrows a band of black hairs runs along the bottom of the front The body is of a vivid green mixed with a little yellow He walks on four feet and the length of his body comprehending that of the head is about fifteen inches The female is subject to the menstrual flux  Plate CCLXXIII CALLITRIX  THE MUSTACHE  Mustache monkey with ashort nose the end marked with a transverse line of pure white the face naked

the same animal which the voyagers to Guinea have called  whitenose  There are other apes on the Gold coast which are called  whitenoses  because that is the only part of their body which is of that colour They are ferocious and stinking animals  Relat d'Artus    Hist gen des Voyages    tom    p    because the lips below the nose are of a bright white colour and the rest of the face is of a blackish blue There are also two tufts of yellow hair under the ears which  give it a singular appearance and as it is at the same time very small it appears to be the most beautiful of all the monkeys  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The mustache has cheekpouches and callosities on the thighs Its tail is much longer than the body and head being nineteen or twenty inches in length Its face is of a blueish black colour with a large white mark which extends over the whole upper lip which is naked except a border of black hairs that surrounds the margins of both lips Its body is short and squat It has two tufts of bright yellow hair under the ears and likewise a tuft of curled hair on the top of the head The hair on the body is of a greenish ashcolour and that on the breast

colour of the whole upper part of the body and the outside of the limbs a mixture of dusky yellow and green the lower part white tinged with yellow the tail very long and slender above of an olive

beautiful Its name seems to indicate that it comes from Siam and the other eastern provinces of Asia It is certain however that it is a native of the Old Continent and exists not in the New because it has cheekpouches and callosities on the buttocks neither of which characters belong to the sagoins or sapajous the only American animals who can be compared to the monkeys But independent of the name I am inclined to think that this monkey is more common in the East Indies than in Africa because it is affirmed by voyagers that most of the apes in this part of Asia are of a brownish green colour  'The apes of Guzarat are of a brownish green colour and have long white beards and eyebrows These animals which the Banians  from a religious principle allow to multiply without end are so familiar that numbers of them perpetually enter the houses and the sellers of fruits and confections have much difficulty in preserving their wares  Hist gen des Voyages tom p  '  M Edwards has given a figure and description of a monkey under the denomination of  the middlesized black ape  which seems to make a nearer approach to the talapoin than any other I here add Edwards's description  This monkey was about the size of a large cat of a gentle nature in respect to any one He loved playing with a kitten as most monkeys do He was a little vicious according to their nature being a male  His head was pretty round the skin of the face of a tawny fleshcolour thinly covered with black hair The ears were shaped like the human The eyes were of a reddish hazel colour with black pupils The hair was long above the eyes and the eyebrows joined together it was also long on the temples which partly covered the ears The head back arms legs and tail were covered with pretty long loose dusky black hair not very harsh or over soft His breast belly c were almost bare of hair of a dusky flesh colour with two nipples on the breast The four paws were all of them formed something like a human hand they are covered with black soft skin having little or no hair on them the nails are flat  Edwards's Gleanings    p    and refer to the figure he has given that the reader may compare the two animals If the size and colour be excepted they have such a resemblance to each other that they may be regarded as species very nearly allied if not varieties of the same species In this case as we are not certain  Plate CCLXXV TALAPOIN  that our talapoin is a native of the East Indies and as Edwards assures us that his monkey came from Guinea we must refer the talapoin to the same climate or rather suppose that it is common to the southern regions of both Africa and Asia It is probably the same species of black apes mentioned by Bosman under the name of  Baurdmannetjes  whose skin he remarks is an excellent fur  In Guinea there is a third species of ape which is very beautiful and generally exceeds not two feet in length Its hair is extremely black and more than an inch long and its beard is white from which circumstance the Dutch call it  Bourdmannetje  Bonnets are made of their skins and each fur sells at four crowns  Voyage de Bosman    p      The DOUC  The name of this animal in CochinChina It is called  Sisac  in Madagascar  CochinChina monkey with a short flattish face bounded on each side by long hairs of a yellowish white colour on the neck a collar of purplish brown the lower part of the arms thighs and tail are white the upper part of the arms and thighs black the back belly and sides gray tinged with yellow Above the root of the tail is a spot of white which extends beneath as far as the lower part of the belly and part of the thighs The feet are black and the buttocks covered with hair This is a very large species about four feet long from the nose to the tail but the tail not so long  Pennant's Synops of quad p    Cercopithecus cinereus genis longis pilis ex albo flavicantibus obsitis torque ex castaneo purpurascente Le grand singe de la CochinChine  Brisson quad p    or CochinChina Monkey  THE Douc is the last of that class of animals which we have called  apes    baboons  and  monkeys  Without being precisely any of these three kinds he participates of each He is allied to the monkeys by the length of his tail to the baboons by his size and to the apes by his flat face He seems by a particular character to form the shade between the monkey's and sapajous In these two tribes of animals the monkeys are distinguished by naked buttocks and all the sapajous have these parts covered with hair Of all the monkeys the douc has hair on the buttocks like the sapajous He resembles them also in the flatness of the muzzle But upon the whole he has much more affinity to  the monkeys than to the sapajous from which he differs by his tail not being prehensile and by other essential characters Besides the interval which separates the two tribes is immense for the douc and all the monkeys belong to the Old Continent and all the sapajous are natives of the New World It may likewise be remarked that as the douc like the monkeys has a long tail but has no callosities on the buttocks he forms the shade between the orangoutangs and monkeys as the gibbon does on another account having no tail like the orangoutangs but like the monkeys having callosities on the buttocks Independent of these general relations the douc has peculiar characters which render him distinguishable at first sight from the apes baboons monkeys and sapajous His robe which is variegated with many colours seems to indicate the ambiguity of his nature and distinguishes his species in a conspicuous manner Round his neck there is a collar of a purplish blue colour A white beard surrounds his cheeks His lips are black and he has a black ring round his eyes His face and ears are red the top of his head and body gray the breast and belly yellow His legs are white below and black above His tail is white with a large spot of the same colour on the loins The feet are black with several shades of different colours  This animal which I was assured came from CochinChina is likewise found in Madagascar and it is the same with what Flacourt mentions under the name of  Sifac  in the following terms 'In Madagascar there is another species of white monkey with a tawny collar which frequently walks on the two hind legs It has a white tail and two tawny spots on the flanks It is larger than the  vari  maucauco and smaller than the  varicossi  vari This species is called  Sifac  and feeds upon beans It is very frequent about Andrivoura Dambourlomb and Ranafoulchy  Voyage de Flacourt p  ' The tawny collar the white tail and the spots on the flanks indicate in the clearest manner that the Sifac of Madagascar is the same species with the douc of CochinChina  Travellers assure us that in the stomachs of the large apes in the southern provinces of Asia bezoars are found of a superior quality to those of the goats and gazelles These large apes are the ouanderou and the douc and of course to them the production of the bezoars must be referred It is alledged that the bezoars of the ape are always round while the other kinds are of different figures  As the apes as well as the goats eat the buds of certain shrubs bezoar stones are produced in their bellies They are often found in the excrements which they discharge when flying from danger These stones are dearer and more esteemed than any other kind They are likewise rounder and have more powerful virtues One grain of this bezoar has been found to have an equal effect with two of that produced by the goats  Descript Hist de Macacar    p    Nota  From comparing this passage with that of Knox related in the article  ouanderou  it appears that the ouanderous feed upon the buds of trees and of course most commonly produce bezoars    Plate CCLXXVI DOUC  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The douc has no callosities on the buttocks but is every where covered with hair His tail is not so long as his body and head His face is covered with a reddish down The ears are naked and of the same colour with the face The lips as well as the orbits of the eyes are brown The colours of the hair are vivid and various He has a purplish brown collar round his neck He has white on his front head body arms legs c and a kind of yellowish white beard The top of the front and the upper part of the arms are black The under parts of the body are of a cinereous gray and a whitish yellow colour The tail and under part of the loins are white He walks as often on two as on four feet When erect he is three and a half or four feet high It is uncertain whether the females of this species be subject to the menstrual discharge  The SAPAJOUS  Sapejou  a word derived from  cayouassou  the name of these animals in Brasil and which is pronounced  sajouassou  and the SAGOINS  Sagoin  a word derived from  cagui  which is pronounced  sagcui  and is the name of these animals in Brasil  WE now pass from the Old Continent to the New All the fourhanded animals formerly described and which were comprehended under the generic names of  apes    baboons  and  monkeys  belong exclusively to the Old Continent and all the rest whose history we are about to relate are found only in the New World We first distinguish them by the two generic names  sapajous  and  sagoins  The feet of both are constructed nearly in the same manner with those of the apes baboon and monkeys But they differ from the apes by having tails They differ from the baboons by the want of cheekpouches and callosities on their buttocks In fine they differ from the apes baboons and monkeys by having the portion between their nostrils very broad and thick and the apertures placed to a side and not under the nose Hence the sapajous and sagoins differ not only specifically but generically from the apes  baboons and monkeys When compared with each other we likewise find that they differ in generic characters for all the sapajous have prehensile tails which are so constructed that the animals can use them as fingers to lay hold of any thing This under part of the tail which they fold extend curl up or unfold at pleasure and by the extremity of which they suspend themselves on the branches of trees is generally deprived of hair and covered with a smooth skin The tails of all the sagoins on the contrary are proportionally longer than those of the sapajous and are straight flaccid and entirely covered with hair so that they can neither use the tail in laying hold of any thing nor in suspending themselves This differnce alone is sufficient to distinguish a sapajou from a sagoin  We know eight sapajous which may be reduced to five species The  ouarine  or  gouariba  of Brasil This sapajou is as large as a fox and differs from the  alouate  of Cayenne in colour only The hair of the ouarine is black and that of the alouate is reddish and as they resemble each other in every other respect I consider them as belonging to the same species The  coaita  which is black like the ouarine but not so large The  exquima  seems to be a variety of this species The  sajou  or  sapajou  properly so called is small of a brown colour  and commonly known by the name of the capuchin monkey Of this species there is a variety which we shall call the  gray sajou  to distinguish it from the  brown sajou  The  sai  which some travellers have called the  weeper  is somewhat larger than the sajou and has a broader muzzle There are two kinds which differ only in colour the one being reddish brown and the other whitish red The  saimiri  which is commonly called the  orange monkey  It is the smallest and most beautiful of the sapajous  We are acquainted with six species of sagoins The  saki  which is the largest and whose tail is covered with hair so long and bushy that it has been called the  foxtailed monkey  There seems to be a variety in this species I have seen two both of which appeared to be adults but the one was almost twice as large as the other The  tamarin  is generally black with the four feet yellow But they vary in colour for I have seen some of them brown and spotted with yellow The  ouistiti  which is remarkable for large tufts of hair round its face and an annulated tail The  marikina  which has a mane round the neck and bushy hair like the lion at the end of the tail From this circumstance it has received the appellation of the  lionmonkey  The  pinche  whose face is of a beautiful black colour with hair which descends  from the top and each side of the head in the form of long smooth tresses The  mico  is the most beautiful of the sagoins Its hair is of a silver white colour and its face is as red as vermilion  We proceed to the history and description of each of these sapajous and sagoins most of which have hitherto been unknown  The OUARINE  Ouarine the name of this animal at Maragnon  The preacher monkey with black shining eyes short round ears and a round beard under the chin and throat The hairs on the body are of a shining black long yet lie so close on each other that the animal appears quite smooth The feet and end of the tail are brown The tail is very long and always twisted at the end It is of the size of a fox  Pennant's synops of quad p    The monkeys called  ouarines  are all black and of the size of large dogs They cry so loud as

to the magnitude of  baboons They have prehensile tails and consequently belong to the family of sapajous in which they hold a distinguished rank not only by their stature but also by their voice which resounds like a drum and is heard at a great distance Maregrave relates  Marcgrav Hist Bras p  'That every morning and evening the ouarines assemble in the woods that one of them takes a more elevated station and gives a signal with his hand for the others to sit around and listen to him that when he peceives them to be all seated he begins a discourse in a tone so loud and rapid as to be heard at a great distance and a person would be led to think that the whole were crying together that all the rest however keep the most profound silence that when he stops he gives a signal with his hand for the others to reply that in an instant the whole cry together till he commands silence by another signal which they obey in a moment that the first resumes his discourse or song and that after hearing him attentively for a considerable time the assembly breaks up' These facts which Marcgrave says he has often witnessed may perhaps be exaggerated and seasoned a little with the marvellous The whole may be founded on the terrible noise made by these animals They have a kind of osseous drum in their throat in the concavity of which the sound is augmented multiplied and  makes a howling noise Hence these sapajous have been distinguished from all others by the name of  howlers  We have never seen the ouarine but have the skin of an alouate and likewise a dried foetus of the same species in which the bone of the throat the instrument of the great noise he makes is already perceptible  The alouate monkey is a savage animal of a reddish bay colour very large and by means of the singular structure of the os hyoides makes a terrible rattling noise which is heard at a great distance  Barrère    Hist Franc Equin p  In the island of St George under the Tropic and about two leagues from the continent of America there are monkeys as large as calves which make such a strange noise that people who are not accustomed to it think the mountains are fallingThey are exceedingly wild  Voyage de Gentil    tom    p    According to Marcgrave the ouarine has a large square face black and brilliant eyes short roundish ears and a tail naked at the extremity which adheres firmly to every thing it can embrace The hair on the whole body is black long smooth and lustrous that on the chin and throat is longer and forms a kind of round beard and that on the hands feet and part of the tail is brown The female is of the same colour with the male and differs from him only in being smaller The females carry their young on their back and leap with them from branch to branch and from tree to tree The young embrace with their arms and hands the narrowest part of the mother's body and remain firmly fixed as long as she is in motion Besides  these animals are so wild and mischievous that they can neither be conquered nor tamed They bite cruelly and though not carnivorous they fail not to excite terror by their frightful voice and their ferocious aspect As they feed only upon fruits potherbs grain and some insects their flesh is not bad eating  Monkeys are the most common game and the most agreeable to the taste of the Amazon IndiansSome of them are as large as a greyhound  Voyage sur la rivière de l'Amazone    par M de la Condamine    p  Cayenne is the country of monkeysWhen the reluctance at eating them is once overcome it is certain that their flesh is very good It is white and though generally not overcharged with fat it fails not to be tender delicate and well tasted Fine soup is made of their heads which are served up like boiled capons  Voyage de Desmarchais    tom    p    et  There are monkeys in Cayenne of the size of large dogs and of a reddish colour They are called  howlers  because when in troops they make a noise like a flock of hogs fighting They inspire terror and have very large mouths I believe they are ferocious When the Savages shoot them with arrows they extract the arrow out of their bodies with their hands like a human creature The flesh of the howlers is very good and resembles mutton One of them is a meal to six persons They have a horn in their throat which renders their cries hideous  Voyage de Binet    p  The Achagua savages along the river Oronoko are fond of the yellow monkeys called  arabata  which make an insupportable noise every morning and evening  Hist de l'Orenoque    par Gumilla    p      'The hunters' Oexmelin remarks 'bring home in the evening the monkeys they kill in the country of Cape GraciasaDio They roast one part of these monkeys and boil the other The flesh is good and resembles that of the hare  but it is sweetish and requires a great deal of salt in dressing The fat is very good and as yellow as that of a capon We lived upon these animals during all the time we remained there because we could procure no other food and the hunters supplied us daily with as many as we could eat I went to see this species of hunting and was surprised at the sagacity of these animals not only in distinguishing particularly those who make war against them but when attacked in defending themselves and providing for their own safety When we approached they all assembled together uttered loud and frightful cries and threw at us dried branches which they broke off from the trees Some of them voided their excrements in their hands and threw them at our heads I likewise remarked that they never abandoned one another that they leapt from tree to tree with incredible agility and that they flung themselves headlong from branch to branch without ever falling to the ground because before reaching the earth they always caught hold of a branch either with their hands or tail so that if not shot dead at once they could not be laid hold of for even when mortally wounded they remain fixed to the trees where they often die and fall not till they are corrupted More than four days after death I have seen them firmly fixed to the trees and fifteen or sixteen of them are frequently  shot before three or four of them can be obtained What is singular as soon as one is wounded the rest collect about him and put their fingers into the wound as if they meant to sound it and when much blood is discharged some of them keep the wound shut while others make a mash of leaves and dexterously stop up the aperture This operation I have often observed with much admiration The females bring forth but one young which they carry in the same manner as the Negresses do their children The young monkey embraces its mother's neck with the two forefeet and with the two hind it lays hold of the middle of her back When she wants to give it suck she takes it in her paws and presents the breast to it like a woman There is no other method of obtaining the young but by killing the mother for she never abandons it When she is killed it falls from her and may then be seized When these animals are embarrassed they assist each other in passing a brook or from one tree to another Their cries are heard at the distance of more than a league  Hist des Aventuriers par Oxemelin tom p  '  Most of these facts are confirmed by Dampier  The monkey's found in the neighbourhood of the Bay of Campeachy are the ugliest I ever saw They are much bigger than a hare and have great tails about two feet and a half long The under side of their tails is all bare with a black hard skin but the upper side and all the body is covered with coarse long black staring hair These creatures keep together or in a company and ramble over the woods leaping from tree to tree If they meet with a single person they will threaten to devour him When I have been alone I have been afraid to shoot them especially the first time I met them They were a great company dancing from tree to tree over my head chattering and making a terrible noise and a great many grim faces and shewing antick gestures Some broke down dry sticks and threw at me others scattered their urine and dung about my ears at last one bigger than the rest came to a small limb just over my head and leaping directly at me made me start back but the monkey caught hold of the bough with the tip of his tail and there continued swinging to and fro and making mouths at meAt last I past on they still keeping me company with the like menacing postures till I came to our huts The tails of these monkeys are as good to them as one of their hands and they will hold as fast by them If two or more of us were together they would hasten from us The females with their young ones are much troubled to leap after the males for they have commonly two One she carries under one of her arms the other sits on her back and clasps her two forepaws about its neck These monkeys are the most sullen I ever met with for all the art we could use would never tame them It is a hard matter to shoot one of them so as to take it for if it gets hold with its claws or tail it will not fall as long as one breath of life remains After I have shot at one and broke a leg or an arm I have pitied the poor creatures to see it look and handle the wounded limb and turn it about from side to side These monkeys are very rarely or as some say never on the ground  Dampier    vol    part    p    He assures us however that the females generally produce two young one of which the  mother carries between her arms and the other on her back In general the sapajous even of the smallest species are not very prolific and it is probable that the largest produce not above one or two at a time  Distinctive Characters of this Species  The ouarine has the apertures of the nostrils placed at a side and not under the nose the partition of the nostrils is very thick He has neither cheekpouches nor callosities on the buttocks which are covered with hair like the rest of the body He has a long prehensile tail black long hair and a large concave bone in his throat He is of the size of a greyhound and the long hair under his neck forms a kind of round beard He generally walks on four feet  The alouate has the same characters with the ouarine and only differs from him by having a larger beard and the hair of a reddish brown colour I know not whether the females of these species be subject to the menses From analogy I should presume that they are not having generally found that the apes baboons and monkeys with naked buttocks are alone subject to this evacuation  The COAITA  Fourfingered monkey with a long flat face of a swarthy flesh colour eyes sunk in the head ears like the human limbs of a great length and uncommonly slender hair black long and rough only four

largest of the sapajous I saw one of them at the palace of the Duke of Bouillon  where by its familiarity and even its caresses it procured the affection of those who had the charge of it But notwithstanding all the care and attention it received it was unable to resist the cold of the winter It died to the regret of its master who was so obliging as to send it to me to be placed in the Royal Cabinet I saw another in the house of the Marquis de Montmirail This was a male and the former a female Both were equally tractable and well tamed Hence this sapajou by its mild and docile disposition differs much from the ouarine and alouate who are so wild that no art can tame them Neither has it like them an osseous pouch in the throat Like the ouarine its hair is black but rough The coaita likewise differs from all the other sapajous by having only four fingers on his hands By this character and his prehensile tail he is easily distinguished from the monkeys who have all five fingers and a flaccid tail  The animal called  exquima  by Marcgrave is a species very nearly allied to the  coaita  and is perhaps only a variety of it This author seems to have been deceived when he tells us that the exquima is a native of Guiney and Congo The figure he has given of it was alone sufficient to have convinced him of his error for it represents this animal with a tail rolled up at the point a character which belongs exclusively to the sapajous Of course Marcgrave's exquima is not  a monkey of Guiney but a sapajou with a prehensile tail which had been transported thither from Brasil The name  exquima  or  quima  by abstracting the article  ex  and which ought to be pronounced  quoima  is not very different from  quoaita  the manner in which several authors spell the name  coaita  Hence every circumstance concurs in establishing Marcgrave's  exquima  which he calls a Guiney monkey to be a Brasilian  sapajou  and a variety only of the coaita which it resembles in dispositions size colour and the prehensile tail The most remarkable difference is that the exquima has whitish hair on the belly and a white beard two inches long under the chin  Cercopithecus

seem not sufficient to constitute two distinct species for we learn from the evidence of travellers that some coaitas are black and others white and some have beards and others no beards 'There are' says Dampier 'great droves of monkeys some of them white but most of them black some have beards others  are beardless They are of a middle size yet extraordinary fat at the dry season when the fruits are ripe and they are very good meat for we ate of them very plentifully The Indians were shy of eating them for a while but they soon were persuaded to it by seeing us feed on them so heartily In the rainy season they have worms in their bowels I have taken a handful of them out of one monkey we cut open and some of them seven or eight feet long They are a very waggish kind of monkey and played a

intestines correspond with our coaitas M Daubenton in dissecting these animals found a great number of worms some of which were from twelve to thirteen inches long It is obvious therefore that the exquima of Marcgrave is  a sapajou of the same species or at least of a species very nearly allied to that of the coaita  We must likewise remark that if the animal mentioned by Linnaeus under the

as he says the  exquima  of Marcgrave he has omitted the  prehensile tail  which is the most essential character and ought alone to determine whether this  diana  belongs to the genus of  sapajous  or to that of the  monkeys  and of course whether it is found in the Old or the New Continent  Independent of this variety the characters of which are conspicuous there are other varieties though less remarkable in the species of the coaita That described by M Brisson had whitish hair on all the under parts of the body But those I have seen were entirely black and had very few hairs on the inferior parts of the body where the skin appeared and was equally black with the hair Of the two coaitas mentioned by Mr Edwards  Gleanings p  the one was black and  the other brown On account of the length and slenderness of their legs and tail they were called  spider monkeys  Some years ago a coaita was sent me under the denomination of  chamek  which I was told came from the coast of Peru I shall give a description of it in the margin  This animal was brought from the coast of Bancet in Peru when thirteen months old It weighed about six pounds The whole body was black The skin of the face was naked of a coarse grain and of the colour of a Mulatto The hair was coarse and from two to three inches in length The ears which resembled those of man were naked and of the same colour with the face The tail was one foot ten inches long five inches thick at the base and about one inch at the point It was round and garnished with hair above and below about thirteen inches from the origin but naked below nine inches from the extremity where the under part of it is flat and furrowed in the middle and round above This animal suspends itself by the tail and likewise uses it as a fifth hand to lay hold of any thing it wants Its length was thirteen inches from the point of the nose to the origin of the tail It had only two paps placed nearly under the armpits  from which it will appear that this chamek of Peru with the exception of a few varieties is the same animal with the coaita of Guiana  These sapajous are very dexterous and intelligent They go in companies and mutually warn and assist each other It uses its tail as a fifth hand and seems to employ this instrument more than either its hands or feet  This creature has no more than four fingers to each of its fore paws but the top of the tail is smooth underneath and on this it depends for its chief actions for the creature holds every thing by it and slings itself with the greatest ease from every tree and post by its meansIt is a native of the main continent and a part of the food of the Indians  Russel Hist of Jamaica    chap    sect    To balance  this advantage Nature has deprived this animal of a thumb We are assured that it seizes fishes with its tail which is by no means incredible for we have seen one of our coaitas lay hold in this manner of a squirrel which had been put into its chamber as a companion They have the address to break the shells of oysters in order to eat them  At the island of Gorgonia on the coast of Peru we took notice of several monkeys who lived partly upon oysters which they got out of the sea at low water Their way was to take up an oyster and lay it upon a stone and with another stone to keep beating of it till they had broke the shell in pieces  Dampier's voyages    vol    p    It is certain that in order to pass from one tree to another whose branches are too distant for a leap they form a chain by hanging down  In travelling to Panama I saw at Capira one of these monkeys leap from one tree to another which was on the opposite side of the river When they want to reach a place which they cannot accomplish by one leap they link themselves to each other's tail and by this means form a long chain They then spring forward and the first being aided by the impulse of the rest reaches the intended branch and after fixing himself he continues to assist the progress of the others till the whole attain their end  Hist Nat du Indes    par Joseph Acosta    p    linked to each other by their tails and swinging in that manner till the lowest catches hold of a branch and draws up the rest They sometimes pass rivers by the same expedient  The females bring forth but one or two young which they always carry on their back They eat fish worms and insects but fruits are their common food When the fruits are ripe they become very fat and their flesh is then said to be excellent  They are of a middle size yet extraordinary fat at the dry season when the fruits are ripe and they are very good meat for we ate of them very plentifully  Dampier's voyages    vol    p      Distinctive Characters of these Species  The coaita has neither cheekpouches nor callosities on the buttocks He has a very long prehensile tail The partition of the nostrils is very thick and their apertures are placed at a side and not under the nose He has only four fingers on his hands or fore feet Both his hair and skin are black His face is naked and tawny His ears are also naked and resemble those of man He is about a foot and a half in length and his tail is longer than the body and head together He walks on four feet  The exquima is nearly of the same size with the coaita and has likewise a prehensile tail But his colour instead of being black is variegated The hairs on his back are black and yellow and white on the throat and belly He has besides a remarkable beard These differences  however are not sufficient to constitute two distinct species especially as some coaitas are not entirely black but are whitish on the throat and belly The females of these two species are not subject to the periodical evacuation  Plate CCLXXVII COAITA  The SAJOU  The capuchin monkey with a

both very agile and their nimbleness and dexterity are extremely amusing We have had them alive and of all the sapajous their constitution seems to be best adapted to our climate If kept in a chamber during the winter they live comfortably for several years We can even give several examples of their producing in this country Two young ones were brought forth in the M de Pompadour's lodging at Versailles one in the house of M de Reaumur at Paris and another in Mad de Poursel's in Gatinois  M Sanches formerly first physician to the court of Russia communicated this last fact to me in a letter from Mad de Poursel of which the following is an extract 'Bordeaux Jan On the th day of this month the female sapajou brought forth a young one whose head was almost as large as that of the mother During two hours she suffered great pain and we were obliged to cut the belt by which she was fixed otherwise she could not have brought forth Nothing could be more beautiful than to see the

Dampier's voyages  Others have given them the name of  macaque  At the bay of All Saints I saw two species of monkeys the one called  sagouins  and the other  macaques  The sagouins are of the size of

have only two paps and produce two young at a time They are mild docile and so timid that their common cry which resembles that of a rat becomes a kind of groaning when they are threatened with danger In this country they eat Maybugs and snails  All the monkeys of South America live upon fruits flowers and particular insects  Hist des Avanturiers    par Oexmelin    tom    p    in preference to all other food But in Brasil their native climate they live chiefly on grains and wild fruits  The Cays or Sais never remove from the top of a tree that bears fruit in a pod as large as our beans which is their principal food They assemble in troops and particularly when it rains It is pleasant to hear them chattering on the trees The female produces but one at a time and the young as soon as brought forth holds firm by the neck of its mother or father When pursued by the hunters they save themselves by leaping from branch to branch carrying their young on their backs The savages therefore being unable to seize either the young or the old are obliged to wound them with arrowes after which they fall from the tops of the trees either stunned or wounded When cured of the wounds and rendered somewhat tame they are sold by the Savages for when first taken they are so ferocious and bite so obstinately that they quit not their hold till they are torn in pieces  Voyage de Lery    p    which

sagoin exists in AEthiopia and the  fonkes  or  guereza  of Ludolph is probably the  maucauco  or  loris  which are common in the southern regions of the Old Continent Mr Edwards farther remarks that when the ouistiti is in good health its hair is very bushy that one of those he saw  which was very vigorous fed upon several things as biskets fruits potherbs insects and snails that one day being unchained it darted upon a small china golden fish that was in a basin which it killed and devoured with avidity and that afterward small eels were presented to it which at first frighted it by twisting round its neck but that it soon overcame and ate them Mr Edwards subjoins a fact which proves that these small animals might be multiplied in the southern parts of Europe He tells us that they produced young in Portugal where the climate is favourable to them They are at first very ugly having hardly any hair on their bodies and they adhere firmly to the teats of the mother When they

M de la Condamine's description will apply to no other animal than the  Mico  and that it is a distinct and probably a very rare species Though remarkable for the beauty of its hair and the lively red

is mentioned by Marten and some other voyagers But none  Plate CCLXXXVIII MICO or FAIR MONKEY  of their descriptions are so complete as to enable us to ascertain whether it differs in species from the common bear If what they have said however be exact it is probably a distinct species But as we know that the wolf varies in different climates some of them being black others brown others white and others variegated colour is a character of no value in constituting different species I saw two small bears which had been brought from Russia and were entirely white  We find white landbears not only in Russia but in Poland Siberia and Tartary The mountains of Great Tartary furnish great numbers of white bears  Relat de Grande Tartarie    p  These mountain bears do not frequent the sea and yet they are white This colour therefore seems rather to proceed from the difference of climate than from that of the element inhabited by these animals  and yet they were unquestionably of the same species with our Alpine bears These animals likewise vary greatly in size As they live long and become very thick and fat in places where they have plenty of nourishment and are not disturbed the character drawn from magnitude is equivocal Hence we are not authorised to conclude that the bear of the northern seas is a peculiar species solely because he  is white and larger than the common kind  Ursus in Polonia variat maximus nigricans minor fulvus minimus argentinus in confiniis Moschoviae pilis nigris et argentei coloris mixti ex Urso occiso pellis detracta fere ad ulnas sex protendebatur

   Nota  This passage proves that there are white landbears as large as those of the Northern seas  The difference of habits seems not to be more decisive than that of colour and magnitude The bear of the northern seas feeds upon fishes He never quits the margins of the sea and often inhabits the floating islands of ice But if we consider that the bear is an animal which eats every thing that when pressed with hunger he has no choice and that he is not afraid of water these habits will not appear sufficient to form distinct species The fish eaten by the seabears is rather a kind of flesh being chiefly the carcasses of whales walruses and seals The climate produces no other animals Neither does it afford grains or fruits and consequently the bear is under the necessity of subsisting on the productions of the sea Is it not probable that our bears if transported to the mountains of Spitzbergen and finding no food upon land would take to the sea in quest of subsistence  Colour size and mode of living being insufficient no other essential characters remain but those which may be derived from figure Now  all that voyagers have said of the seabear amounts only to this that his head body and hair are longer than those of our bear and that his skull is much harder If these differences were real and considerable they would be sufficient to constitute another species But I am not certain that Marten has examined with accuracy and that the other writers who copied him have not exaggerated  Anderson's hist of Greenland and Ellis Voy to Hudson's Bay  'These white bears' he remarks 'are quite otherwise shaped than those that are seen in our country they have a long head like unto a dog and a long neck and they bark like dogs that are hoarse and all their whole body is much otherwise shaped than ours They are slenderer in the body and a great deal swifter'  Marten's voyage to Spitzbergen    p  This description furnishes the following remarks That the author does not make these bears larger than ours and consequently that we ought to suspect the evidence of those who tell us that the seabear is sometimes thirteen feet in length  A white bear which had been killed was brought aboard Its skin was thirteen feet long  Troisième voyage des Hollandois par le Nord    p    That hair as soft as wool is not a specific character for to render hair soft and even more bushy it is only necessary that an animal be frequently in the water as appears from the land  and water beavers The latter who dwelt oftener in the water than on land have coarser and less bushy hair And I am inclined to think that the other differences are neither real nor so conspicuous as Marten would have us to believe for Dithmar Blefken in his description of Iceland mentions these bears and assures us that he saw one killed in Greenland which raised itself on the two hind feet like our bears but he says not one word which indicates that the white bear of Greenland is not entirely similar to ours  Habet Islandia coloris albi ingentes Ursos in Groenlandia ursum magnum et album habuimus obviam qui neque nos timebat neque nostro clamore abigi poterat verum recta ad nos tanquam ad certam praedam contendebat cumque proprius nos accessisset is bonbarda trajectus ibi demum erectus posterioribus pedibus tanquam homo stabat donec tertio trajiceretur atque ita exanimatus concidit  Dithmar Blefken p    Besides when these animals find prey on land they never go to sea in quest of food They devour raindeer and such other animals as they can seize They even attack men and never fail to dig up dead bodies  The white bears live upon dead whales and in the neighbourhood of these carcasses they are most frequently found They likewise devour men when they can surprise them If they scent the place where a dead body is interred they remove the earth and stones open the coffin and eat the carcass  Recueil des voyages du Nord    tom    p    But hunger which they often feel in these desert and barren lands obliges them to frequent the water in quest of seals young walruses and  whales They take up their residence on islands of ice on which they are often seen floating at a distance and never abandon their station as long as they can find abundance of food When these boards of ice are detached in the spring the bears allow themselves to be carried along and as they cannot regain the land or abandon the ice on which they are embarked they often perish in the open sea Those who arrive with the ice on the coasts of Iceland or Norway  When the islands of ice separate from the North of Greenland and are driven southward the white bears dare not depart from them When they arrive in Norway or at any island they are mad with hunger and strange stories are told of the ravages made by these animals  Recueil des voyages du Nord    tom    p    are starved to such a degree that they devour every thing they meet which may have given rise to the prejudice that these seabears are more fierce and voracious than the common kind Some authors tell us that the seabears are amphibious like the seals and that they can live as long as they please under water But the contrary is evident from the manner of hunting them They are incapable of swimming long and never accomplish above a league at a time They are followed by a small boat and are soon worn out with fatigue If they could dispense with respiration they would dive to the bottom in order to rest themselves But when they dive it is only for a few seconds and for  fear of drowning they allow themselves to be killed on the surface of the water  This white bear swam about a mile We pursued him briskly with three boats and after he was fatigued we killed him  Trois navigations des Hollandois au Norà    par Gerard de Vera    p  They swim from one board of ice to another When we pursued them in our boats they dived at one end of the boat and came up at the other They likewise run very well upon land  Recueil des Voyages du Nord    tom    p  Upon the coast of Spitzbergen a white bear took the water and swam more than a league We followed with our boats and killed him c  Troisième voyage des Hollandois    p      Seals are the common prey of the white bears  When we killed this white bear his stomach was opened in which we found entire pieces of the seadog with the hair and skin on them which shows that he had but lately devoured them  Ibid p    But the walrus from whom they sometimes carry off the young pierces them with its tusks and puts them to flight The whale likewise overwhelms them by its weight and banishes them from the places they frequent They sometimes however devour the young whales All bears are naturally very fat and the whitebears who live upon animals loaded with grease are fatter than the common kind Their fat is very like that of the whale The flesh of these bears is not bad and their skin makes a very warm and durable fur  The white bears go in quest of wolves and seadogs and prefer whales to any other fish They dread the whale who scent and pursues them from a natural antipathy because they eat her young  Recueil des voy du Nord    tom    p  The skins of the white bear are of great use to those who travel in winter They are dressed even at Spitzbergen by steeping them in warm water which extracts the grease and they are afterwards dried Their grease is like suet and after being well melted it becomes as clear as whale oil It is generally burnt in lamps and has not so bad a smell as fish oil Our sailors sell it for whale oil The flesh of these bears is fat and whitishTheir milk is very white and fat  Troisieme voy des Hollandois    tom    p      SUPPLEMENT  I here give a figure of the white sea bear from a drawing sent me by the late Mr Colinson If this drawing be exact it is certain that the sea bear is a different species from the land bear The head is so long when compared with that of the common bear that this character alone is sufficient to constitute a distinct species And those voyagers adhere to truth when they tell us that the figure of the sea bear is totally different from ours and that its head and neck are much longer From the drawing it likewise appears that the feet instead of resembling the human hand like those of the land bear are formed nearly like the feet of a large dog and other carnivorous animals of this kind Besides from several relations it appears that some of these bears are much larger than the land bear  Gerard de Veira asserts that after killing one of these bears he measured the skin and found it to be twentythree feet long which is more than triple the length of the common bear  Trois navigations admirables faites par les Hollandois au Septentrion p  We likewise find from the Collection of Voyages to the North that these sea bears are larger and more ferocious than ours But in the same Collection it is said that though these bears are differently formed and have the head and neck much longer and the body more slender and agile they are nearly of the same size with the common kind  Recueil de Voyages du Nord tom p    All voyagers also agree that the sea bears have the bones of the head so hard that no blow of a club though sufficient to bring an ox to the ground can stun them and that their voice rather resembles the barking of an engraged dog than the deep murmuring cry of the common bear Robert Lade assures us that in the environs of the river Rupper he killed two sea bears of a prodigious size that these famished and ferocious animals attacked the hunters with such impetuosity that they killed several Savages and wounded two Englishmen In page of the third Dutch Voyages to the North we are told that the sailors killed on the coast of Nova Zembla a sea bear whose skin was thirteen feet long Upon the whole therefore I  Plate CCLXXXIX WHITE or POLAR BEAR  am inclined to believe that this animal so much celebrated for its ferocity is really a much larger species than our bear  II  The COW of TARTARY  Grunting ox with a mane on the neck whole body covered with long hair reaching almost to the ground back hunched tail like that of a horse covered with full white and long hairs strikes with its head like a goat is very unruly found in the country of the Calmucks  Pennant's Synops of quad p    Vacca grunniens villosa cauda equina Sarluk  Nov Com Petrop

tom    p    Bubul  Bell's Trav vol    p      M GMELIN in the New Memoirs of the Academy of Petersburg has given a description of a Tartarian cow which at first sight appears to differ from all those we have enumerated under the article  buffalo  'This cow' says he 'which I saw alive and had a drawing made of it is Siberia came from Calmuck It was about two and a half Russian ells in length  By this standard we may judge of its other dimensions the proportions of which have been accurately observed by the painter The body resembles that of a common cow The horns are bended inward The hair on the body and head is back except on the front and ridge of the back where it is white It has a mane on the neck and the whole body like that of a buck is covered with very long hair which descends as far as the knees and makes the legs appear short It has a bunch on the back The tail resembles that of a horse and is white and very bushy The fore legs are black the hind ones white and the whole resemble those of the ox Upon the heels of the hind feet there are two tufts of long hair the one before and the other behind and on the fore feet there is but one tuft placed behind The excrements are more solid than those of cows and when the animal discharges urine it draws its body backward It lows not like an ox but grunts like a hog It is wild and even ferocious for except the man from whom it receives its food it gives blows with its head to every person who comes near it It hardly suffers the presence of domestic cows Whenever it perceives one of them it grunts which it seldom does on any other occasion' To this description M Gmelin adds 'That it is the same animal mentioned by Rubruquis in his travels into Tartary  That there are two species of it among the Calmucks the first called  Sarluk  which I have already described and the second  Chainuk  which differs from the other by the largeness of its head and horns and also by the tail which at its origin resembles that of the horse and terminates like that of a cow But they both have the same natural dispositions'  In the whole of this description there is only a single character which indicates the Calmuck cows to be a particular species and that is their grunting instead of a lowing It every other article they have so strong a resemblance to the bison that they must belong to the same species or rathe the same race Besides though the author says that these cows do not low but grunt he acknowledges that they very rarely utter that kind of sound Perhaps it was an affection peculiar to the individual he saw for Rubruquis and the other writers whom he quotes mention not this grunting Perhaps the bisons when enraged likewise make a grunting noise Even our bulls particularly in the rutting season have a hollow interrupted voice which has a greater resemblance to grunting than to lowing I am persuaded therefore that this grunting cow of Gmelin is nothing else but the bison and does not constitute a particular species  III  The TOLAI or BAIKAL HARE  Baikal hare with a tail somewhat longer than that of a rabbit fur of the colour of the common hare red about the neck and feet tail black above white beneath It is larger than a rabbit and inhabits the country beyond Lake Baikal  Pennant's synops of quad p    Lepus cauda in supina parte nigra in prona alba  Brissn quad p      THIS animal is very common in the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal in Tartary It is somewhat larger than the rabbit which it resembles in the figure of the body the fur the gait the colour the taste of the flesh and the habit of digging a retreat in the earth Their internal structure is likewise the same  Cuniculus insigniter caudatus coloris leporiniCirca internas partes haec observavi Caecum colo

tom    tab    fig    and there is no difference but in the length of the tail that of the tolai being considerably longer  Hence it is extremely probable that this animal is only a variety in the species of the rabbit Rubruquis when treating of the animals in Tartary says 'There are rabbits with a long tail and black and white hairs at the point There are no stags few hares a vast number of gazelles' c This passage seems to insinuate that our shorttailed rabbit is not found in Tartary  Relation des voyages en Tartarie par Rubruquis p  or rather that it has undergone some variations in that climate and particularly in the length of the tail for as the tolai resembles the rabbit in every other respect it is unnecessary to consider them as belonging to different species  IV  The ZISEL  Marmot without external ears having only a small orifice on each side of the head for the admittance of sunds It has a blunt nose a long slender body and a very short tail The colour is dark gray or cinereous brown  Pennant's Synops of quad p    Mus Noricus  Gesner    quad p    Raii synops quad p    Ziesel  Schwenkfelt Theriotroph p    Mus citellus cauda abbreviata corpore cinereo auriculis

de animantibus subterraneis    p      citellus  be a different animal from the hamster  cricetus  They have indeed a great resemblance to each other and inhabit nearly the same countries  The hamster is found in Misnia Thuringia and Hannover and the zisel in Hungary Austria and Poland where it is called  suset  They differ however in so many characters that I am convinced they constitute two distinct species The zisel is smaller than the hamster Its body is long and slender like the weasel but that of the hamster is thick like the rat It has no external ears but two auditory passages concealed under the hair The ears of the hamster are short but they are broad and very conspicuous The zisel is of a uniform cinereous gray colour but the hamster has three large white spots on each side of the breast These differences when joined to this circumstance that the two animals though they inhabit the same regions never intermix are sufficient  to remove every doubt with regard to the diversity of their species though they resemble one another in the shortness of the tail and legs in having teeth like those of the rat and even in natural habits such as digging retreats in the earth laying up magazines of provisions destroying the corn c Besides what must remove every doubt on this subject Agricola an exact and judicious writer in his treatise on subterraneous animals gives a description of both animals and distinguishes them so clearly that it is impossible to confound them  Istius viverrae scilicet ferocitatis est etiam agri vastator et cereris hostis  hamster  quem

de anim subt pag  This description of the hamster when compared with that of the zisel given by the same author and which the reader will find in a note on the preceding page is sufficient to demonstrate that these animals are very different from one another  Hence we may conclude that the hamster and zisel are very different species and perhaps as remote from each other as the weasel from the rat  V  The ZEMNI or PODOLIAN MARMOT  Podolian marmot with the cutting teeth of the lower jaw half as long again as those of the upper eyes very minute and as much hid in the fur as those of the mole four toes and a claw instead of the fifth on the fore feet five on the hind tail short colour cinereous size of a squirrel  Pennant's Synops of quad p    Zitsjan  Le Brun    voyag Muscov vol    p      IN Poland and Russia there is another animal called  ziemni  or  zemni  which is of the same genus with the  zisel  but larger stronger and more mischievous The head is pretty thick the body slender and the ears short and rounded It has four large cutting teeth which project out of the mouth the two in the under jaw being thrice as long as the two in the upper The feet are very short covered with hair divided into five toes and armed with crooked claws The hair is soft short and of a mousegray colour The tail is of a moderate size The eyes are as small and equally concealed as those of the mole Rzaczinski gives it the denomination of the  little earth dog  This author seems to be the only one who mentions the zemni though  it be very common in some of the Northern provinces

called  pouch  by the Russians It digs a retreat in the earth and lays waste the gardens This animal was so numerous near Suraz in Volhinia that the inhabitants were obliged to abandon the culture of their gardens It is perhaps the same with Seba's  Norwegian rat  of which he gives a figure and description  Mus ex Norvegia cinereo fuscus rostro gaudet snillo capite longiusculo brevibus latisque

provinces watered by the Wolga as far as Austria there is a small animal  called  souslik  in the Russian language which furnishes a beautiful fur In figure and shortness of tail it has a great resemblance to the shorttailed field mouse But it is distinguished from the mouse or rat kind by its fur which is every where interspersed with small spots of a bright and shining white These spots exceed not a line in diameter and are placed at the distance of two or three lines from each other They are more conspicuous and better defined upon the loins than on the shoulders and head Mr Pennant a well known and very able Naturalist favoured me with one of these sousliks which had been transmitted to him from Austria as an animal unknown to the Naturalists I recognised it to be the same animal with that of which I had a skin in my possession and of which M Sanchez  Formerly physician to the court of Russia  sent me the following notice 'Great numbers of the rats called Sousliks are taken in the barks loaded with salt in the river Kama which desend from Solikamski where there are salt pits and fall into the Wolga above the town of Casan at the confluence  of the Teluschin The Wolga from Simbuski to Somtof is covered with these salt barks and it is in the lands adjacent to these rivers as well as in the barks where the sousliks are taken They have obtained the denomination of  souslik  which signifies  nicetased  because they are extremely fond of salt'  SUPPLEMENT  I now give a figure of this animal which is not in the original work Prince Galitzin at the desire of M de Buffon was so obliging as to send eight sousliks with the necessary precautions for preserving them alive till they should arrive in France These eight animals arrived in Petersburg after a long journey from Siberia But notwithstanding all the attention paid to them they died in passing from Petersburg to France The instructions from Siberia were to feed them only with grain or hempseed to give them as much air as possible to put a considerable quantity of sand in their cage because in their natural state they burrow in light soils  Plate CCXC SOUSLIK  These animals generally dwell in the deserts and dig holes in the declivities of mountains provided the earth be blackish Their holes are not of equal depths and are seven or eight feet long never straight but winding and have from two to five entries the distances of which are unequal being from two to seven feet asunder In these holes they make different apartments and amass in them their winter provisions during the summer In the cultivated fields they collect ears of corn pease lint and hemp seeds and place them separately in different departments of their holes In uncultivated lands they collect the seeds of various herbs During summer they feed upon grains herbs roots and young mice for when the mice are large the souslik is unable to kill them Beside their magazines of provisions these animals dig separate holes some feet distant from the former in which they repose They throw all their ordure out of their retreats The females bring forth from two to five young at a litter which are blind and naked and begin not to see till after the hair appears The time of gestation is not exactly known  IX  The SIBERIAN or GILDED MOLE  Siberian mole with a very short nose no ears three toes on the fore feet on

the proper name of this animal  X  The WHITE WATER RAT  THE water rat of Europe is found in Canada but its colours are different It is brown on the  back and the rest of the body is white and in some places yellow The head muzzle and end of the tail are white The hair is softer and more glossy than that of our waterrat But in every other article these animals are perfectly similar and undoubtedly belong to the same species The white hair is an effect of cold and it is probable that white waterrats may be found in the North of Europe as well as in Canada  XI  THE GUINEY HOG  Hog with a lesser head than the common kind very long slender and sharp pointed ears tail hanging down to the heels without hairs the body covered with short red shining hairs but about the neck and lower part of the

together The Guiney hog is nearly of the same figure with ours and of the same size with the Siam hog that is smaller than the wild boar or the domestic hog It is an original native of Guiney and has been transported to Brasil where it has multiplied prodigiously It is domestic and perfectly tame It has short red shining hair and no bristles even on the back The neck and crupper near the origin of the tail are covered with longer hairs than those on the rest of the body Its head is not so large as that of the European hog from which it differs in the figure of the ears which are very long sharppointed and lie back upon the neck Its tail is also much longer reaching near the ground and entirely destitute of hair This race which according to Marcgrave is peculiar to Guiney is found likewise in Asia and particularly in the island of Java  In the island of Java the hogs have no bristles and they are so fat that their bellies drag upon the ground  Voyage de Mandelso    tom    p

Cape Verd there is another hog or boar which from the number  of his teeth and the enormous size of the tusks in his upperjaw appears to be a peculiar race if not a different species from that of all the other hogs and approaches toward the babiroussa These tusks have a greater resemblance to ivory horns than to teeth They are half a foot long five inches in circumference at the base and bended nearly like the horns of a bull This character alone is not sufficient to constitute a difference in species But what supports this presumption he likewise differs from all other hogs in the length of the aperture of his nostrils in the great breadth and figure of his jaws and in the number and form of his grinders However we have seen the tusks of a wild boar which was killed in the woods of Burgundy and made an approach to the Cape Verd boar Its tusks were about three inches and a half long and four inches in circumference at the base They had also a double bend like the horns of a bull They appeared likewise to consist of solid ivory and it is certain that this boar must have had larger jaws than the common kind  Hence we may presume that the Cape Verd boar is only a simple variety a particular race in the species of the common hog  SUPPLEMENT  We formerly suggested that the wild boar of Cape Verd appeared to be a different race and perhaps a different species from all the other hogs The celebrated M Allamand professor of Natural History at Leyden was kind enough to send us an engraving of this animal and afterwards wrote M Daubenton in the following terms  I believe Sir that the wild boar represented in the plate which I sent you is the same with that pointed out by you under the denomination of the  Wild Boar of Cape Verd  This animal is still living May in the menagerie of the Prince of Orange I visit him occasionally and always with fresh pleasure I cannot help admiring the singular form of his head I have written to the Governour of the Cape of Good Hope begging him if possible to transmit me another But of this I have little hope because even at the Cape it was regarded as a monster which had never hitherto been seen by any person If however I succeed in my request I shall send the animal to France that you and M de Buffon  may have an opportunity of examining it We tried to make the one in our possession copulate with a sow but as soon as she was presented to him he darted upon her with fury and tore her to pieces  We have copied the engraving transmitted to us by M Allamand M Pallas and M Vosmaër have used the same figure and each of them have given a description of this animal M Allamand in his letter to M Daubenton dated at Leyden October remarks that the head is the most singular part of this boar which chiefly differs from that of our hogs by two uncommon appendixes in the form of ears at the side of each eye  We shall here remark that the disdain and cruelty mentioned by M Allamand of this wild boar to the sow when in season seems to prove it to be a different species from our hogs A farther proof arises from the difference in the form of the head both external and internal However as it approaches the hog much nearer than any other animal and as it is found not only in the neighbourhood of Cape Verd but not very distant from the Cape of Good Hope we shall call it the  African boar  and give the history and description of it from the writings of Pallas and Vosmaër  Vosmaër calls it the  wild African boar  or the  boar with a large snout  and distinguishes it with propriety from the Guiney hog with long  pointed ears from the American pecari and from the Indian babiroussa  'M de Buffon' he remarks 'speaking of a part of the jaws the tail and feet of a singular wild boar of Cape Verd preserved in the royal cabinet says that it has cutting teeth But no such teeth appear in our subject'  Hence M Vosmaër insinuates that it is not the same animal We have seen however that M Allamand and I agree that this Cape de Verd boar of which I have had an opportunity of examining a part of the head only is found notwithstanding to be the same large snouted hog which M Vosmaër said was unknown to all the naturalists  M Tulbagh Governour of the Cape of Good Hope who transmitted this wild boar to Europe writes that it was taken between Caffraria and the country of the great Namaquas about two hundred leagues from the Cape and that it was the only one of the species which had been there seen alive M Vosmaër likewise received the skin of an animal of the same species which appeared to differ in some particulars from the live animal  This animal was kept in a cage  and as I was informed' M Vosmaër remarks 'that he was not mischievous I opened the door of his cage He came out without showing any marks of rage He gaily frisked about in quest of food and greedily devoured whatever was given him  Having left him alone for a few moments I found him on my return busy in digging the earth where notwithstanding the pavement was made of small bricks well cemented he had already made a hole of an incredible size with a view as we afterwards discovered to reach a common sewer which passed below at a great depth I caused his labour to be interrupted and it was not without much trouble and the assistance of several men that we could overcome his resistance and make him return to his cage His resentment was expressed by sharp and mournful cries He seems to have been taken in the African woods when he was very young for he has grown considerably since his arrival in Europe and is still alive He passed the last winter very well though the frost was severe and he was confined during the greatest part of that season  In agility he exceeds the hogs of this country He freely allows himself to be stroaked with the hand and even with a stick He seems to be pleased with rough friction for it was by this means that we made him remain quiet when the painter drew his picture When provoked or rudely pushed he retires backward always facing the assailant and shaking or striking forcibly with his head When let loose after long confinement he is very gay leaps and pursues fallowdeer and other animals On these occasions he erects his tail  which is commonly pendulous He emits a strong odour which is not disagreeable but I cannot compare it to any other smell When I stroaked him with the hand this odour approached to that of new cheese He eats all kinds of grains His food when on shipboard was maize and as much fresh herbage as could be procured But after he had tasted barely and European wheat with which other animals in our menagerie are fed he preferred this kind of food and roots dug out of the earth He was so fond of ryebread that he followed any person who had a piece of it When he eats or drinks he supports himself on the knees of his fore feet and he often rests in this position His senses of hearing and smelling are very acute but his sight is limited by the smallness and situation of his eyes which prevent his seeing objects around him because they are placed higher and nearer each other than in other hogs and there are two large excrescences at the sides and below the eyes He has more sagacity than the common hog  The figure of the head is terrible The flatness and breadth of the nose joined to the length of the snout the singular excrescences rising from the sides of the eyes and the strong tusks give to the animal a monstrous aspect The length of the body is about four Rhenish feet  The figure of the body makes a near approach to that of the domestic hog He appears to be smaller hsi back being flatter and his legs shorter  When compared with other hogs his head is deformed both in figure and dimensions The muzzle is large flat and very hard The nose is moveable a little bended laterally toward the base and terminates obliquely The nostrils are large distant from each other and appear only when the head is raised The upper lip is hard and thick at the side Round the tusks it is prominent and pendulous forming behind them a kind of oval cartilaginous protuberance which covers the corners of the muzzle  This animal wants fore teeth both above and below but the gums are smooth rounded and hard  The tusks of the upper jaw are an inch thick at the base crooked and project out of the mouth five inches and a half and terminate in an obtuse point On the side of each of them there is a kind of furrow Those of the under jaw are much smaller less crooked and almost triangular By continual friction against the upper tusks they appear to be cut obliquely We were prevented from examining the grinders by the furious resistance of the animal  In proportion to the head the eyes are small placed higher and nearer each other and the'  ears than in the common hog The iris is of a deep brown colour and the cornea white The upper eyelids are garnished with brown stiff erect and very close ciliae which are longer in the middle than at the two sides There are no ciliae on the under eyelids  The ears are pretty large more round than pointed covered in the inside with close yellow hair and bend back toward the animal's body Under the eyes there is a kind of bulbous or glandular fac and immediately below that appear two round flat thick and horizontal excrescences about two inches and a quarter in diameter In a straight line between these excrescences and the muzzle there is on each side of the head a hard round sharp protuberance  The skin seems to be very thick filled with lard in the ordinary places but flaccid on the neck groin and dewlap In some places it appears to be slightly furrowed unequal and as if the upper part of it fell off by intervals Thinly dispersed over the body are some tufts of hairs consisting of three four or five longer and shorter and placed in a straight line near one another The front and between the ears seem to be wrinkled and are adorned with very close white and brown hairs From thence toward the base of the muzzle descends a narrow band of black and gray hairs which separating in the middle fall upon each  side of the head On the nap of the neck and the anterior part of the back the bristles are the longest and most close Their colour is a dusky brown and gray Some of them are seven or eight inches long In thickness they exceed not those of the common hog and they split in the same manner These bristles are not straight but slightly inclined Upon the back their number is so small that the skin appears to be naked The flanks breast belly sides of the head and neck are garnished with small white bristles  The feet like those of our hogs are divided into two black pointed hoofs The tail is naked hangs perpendicularly and terminates almost in a point  The colour of the head is blackish but that of the back and belly is a bright reddish gray'  Notwithstanding these differences pointed out by M Vosmaër and the repugnance which this boar discovered to the sow that was presented to it I am uncertain whether it is not a variety only of our European hog This species varies greatly in Asia Siam and China My uncertainty is increased by having found about thirty years ago an enormous head of a wild boar that was killed in my own woods the tusks of which were nearly as large as those of the Cape boar  Besides M Comerson informs me that there are wild boars in Madagascar whose head from the ears to the eyes is of the ordinary form but that below the eyes is a protuberance which gradually tapers to the end of the snout so that the animal appears to have two heads the half of the one sunk into the other The flesh of this hog is slimy and insipid This information made me suspect that the animal I had first mentioned under the denomination of the  Wild Boar of Cape Verd  because its head was brought from the neighbourhood of that Cape and afterwards called it the  Wild African Boar  because it exists in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope is likewise found in the island of Madagascar  Addition by Professor Allamand  M de Buffon in his history of the hog has shown that the hog eludes all those methodical distributions into classes and genera the distinguishing characters of which are derived from particular parts of the body Though his reasons are not to be answered they would have acquired additional force if he had been acquainted with the animal under consideration It is a wild boar sent from the Cape of Good  Hope in the year to the menagerie of the Prince of Orange which has hitherto been unknown to the Naturalists Beside the many singularities which make the European hog a detached species this animal exhibits fresh anomalies which distinguish him from all the other varieties of the same genus for the figure of his head is not only different but he has no cutting teeth from which most of our Nomenclators have drawn their distinctive characters though the number of the teeth is by no means uniform even in our domestic hogs  To M Tulbagh Governour of the Cape of Good Hope who misses no opportunity of transmitting to Europe the curious productions of that country we are indebted for this wild boar In his letter he remarks that this animal was taken about two hundred leagues from the Cape and that it was the first which had ever been seen there alive The last year however he sent another which is still living and in he transmitted a skin of which we have only been able to preserve the head These circumstances seem to indicate that this animal is not rare in its native country I know not whether Kolbe means to speak of these boars in the following passage 'In the country occupied by the Dutch we rarely meet with  wild hogs  As there are few woods which are their common retreats they have no motive to frequent these territories Besides the lions tigers and other rapacious  pacious animals prevent the multiplication of the hogs by devouring great numbers of them  Descript du Cap de Bonneesperance tom p  ' He adds no description and therefore no conclusion can be drawn Besides he ranks among the number of Cape hogs the large anteater which is an American animal and has no resemblance to the hog What credit is due to an author so ill informed  The body of our African boar resembles that of the European kind But it differs widely in the form of the head which is of an enormous size The most conspicuous objects are the large tusks which spring from each side of the upper jaw and are directed almost perpendicularly upward They are near seven inches long and terminate in a blunt point Two similar tusks but smaller and thinner rise from the under jaw and apply themselves exactly to the external side of the superior tusks when the mouth is shut These are powerful arms which he may use to advantage in his native country where he must be often exposed to the attacks of carnivorous animals  His head which is large and flat before terminates in an ample snout nearly equal in diameter to the breadth of the head and of a hardness which approaches to that of horn He uses it like our hogs in digging the earth His eyes are small and situated so far forward in the head that he can only see straight before him They  are nearer each other and the ears than in our European boars Below the eyes there is a depression in the skin which forms a kind of wrinkled sac The inside of his ears are closely covered with hair A little lower and near the side of the eyes the skin rises and forms two excrescences which when viewed at a certain distance have a perfect resemblance to a couple of ears being of the same figure and size and though not moveable they lie nearly in the same plane with the forehead Still lower between these excrescences and the tusks there is a large wart on each side of the head It is easy to perceive that a configuration of this kind must give a very singular aspect to the animal When viewed in front we think we see four ears upon a head which has no resemblance to that of any known animal and inspires terror by the largeness of its tusks  Pallas  Pallas Miscellanea Zoologica et ejusdem Spicilegia Zoologica Fasciculus Secundus  and Vosmaër who have given good descriptions of this boar tell us that when he arrived in Holland he was very mild and tame that as he had been several months on board the vessel and had been taken young he was become almost domestic but that when pursued by strangers he retired slowly backward and presented his front with a menacing air and even those who were daily near him were not without apprehensions of danger One day he conceived  a resentment against his keeper whom he wounded so desperately in the thigh with his tusks that the poor man died next day To prevent similar accidents he was taken out of the menagerie and so closely imprisoned that no body could approach him He died in about twelve months and his skin is preserved in the Prince of Orange's cabinet The other one which is now in the same menagerie is still very young and his tusks exceed not two inches in length When allowed to come out of the place where he is confined he testifies his joy by leaping bounding and running with much more agility than our hogs On these occasions he carries his tail perfectly erect The inhabitants of the Cape on account of his swiftness give him the denomination of  hartlooper  or courser  This animal unquestionably forms a genus distinct from all the other known races of hogs Though he resembles them in the body the want of cutting teeth and the singular structure of the head are characters too marked to be ascribed to the influence of climate especially as there are hogs in Africa which differ from ours only by being smaller Besides it would appear that he cannot produce with our hogs A Guiney sow was presented to him After smelling her for some time he pursued her into a narrow place from which she could not escape and tore her to pieces with his tusks He afterwards abused a common sow to such a degree that she was  carried off in order to save her from destruction  It is wonderful that this animal which as I formerly remarked seems not to be rare in its native country has not been mentioned by any traveller or at least in terms so vague that no idea can be formed of it Flacourt  Hist de la grand isle Madagascar p  tells us that in Madagascar there are wild boars which have two horns on the side of the nose resembling two callosities and that these animals are nearly as dangerous as in France M de Buffon imagines that this passage relates to the babiroussa and perhaps he may be right But it may with equal probability relate to our boar These horns which resembled two callosities may have been the tusks of this boar as well as those of the babiroussa though extremely ill described and what Flacourt adds that these animals are dangerous seems to correspond better with our African boar M Adanson  Hist Nat du Senegal p  when speaking of a wild boar he saw in Africa expresses himself in these terms 'I saw' says he 'one of those enormous wild boars peculiar to Africa and which I believe have never been mentioned by any Naturalist It was black like the European wild boar but vastly larger in size It had four large tusks the two superior of which bended in a semicircular form toward the front and had the appearance of  Plate CCXCI BOAR of CAPE VERDE  horns' M de Buffon supposes that M Adanson means to describe the babiroussa and were it not for his authority I should have been led to believe that M Adanson intended to point out our African boar for if he had the babiroussa under his inspection I cannot comprehend how he should remark that it had never been mentioned by any Naturalist He is too much conversant in Natural History not to know that the babiroussa has been often described and that its head is found in almost every Musaeum in Europe  But in Africa there is perhaps another species of wild boar with which we are still unacquainted and was the animal seen by M Adanson This conjecture is supported by the description which M Daubenton has given of a part of the jaws of a Cape Verd wild boar His remarks clearly prove that it differs from our boars and would apply directly to the one under consideration if there had not been cutting teeth in each of these jaws  I willingly assent to most of M Allamand's reflections But I persist in believing as he himself at first believed that the Cape Verd boar which I mentioned and the jaws described by M Daubenton belong to the same species tho'  the former had no cutting teeth for in no animal is the number and order of the teeth so various as in the hog kind This difference alone seems not sufficient to constitute two species of the African wild boar and that of Cape Verd especially as all the other characters of the head appear to be the same  XIII  THE MEXICAN WOLF  Wolf with a very large head great jaws vast teeth on the upper lips very strong bristles reflected backwards not unlike the softer spines of a porcupine and of a gray and white colour large erect cinereous ears the space between marked with broad tawny spots The head ashcoloured striped transversely with bending dusky lines neck fat and thick covered with a loose skin marked with a long tawny stroke On the breast is another of the same kind Body ashcoloured spotted with black and the sides striped from the back downwards with the same colour belly cinereous tail long of the colour of the belly tinged in the middle with tawny legs and feet striped with black and ashcolour Sometimes this variety is found white  Pennant's synops of quad p    Xoloizcuintli  Hernand Mex p    Cuetlachtli seu lupus Indicus  Fernand Ann Nov

and gray wolves in North America It appears that this species is diffused as far as New Spain and Mexico and that in this warm climate it has undergone some alterations without having his nature or dispositions changed for the Mexican wolf has the same figure appetites and habits as the European or North American wolf and all of them appear to be the same species The Mexican wolf or rather the wolf of New Spain where he is more common than in Mexico has five toes on the fore feet and four on those behind The ears are long and erect and the eyes sparkle like those of our wolf But the head is twice as large the neck thicker and the tail less bushy Above the mouth there are some bristles as large but not so stiff as those of the hedgehog Upon an ashcoloured ground the body is marked with some yellow spots The head is of the same colour with the body and marked with transverse brownish lines and the front is spotted with yellow The ears are gray like the head and body There is a long yellow spot on the neck another on the breast and a  third on the belly On the flanks are transverse bands from the back to the belly The tail is gray with a yellow spot in the middle The legs are barred with gray and brown This is the most beautiful of all wolves and its skin should be esteemed for its variety of colours  It might be supposed on account of the variety of colours that the Mexican wolf is a lynx which like the wolf is found in both Continents But a bare inspection of the figure given by Recchi will show that it has a perfect resemblance to the wolf and none at all to the lynx  But nothing indicates it to be a different species from the common kind which varies from gray to white from white to black and a mixture of both without changing its species And we learn from Fernandes that those wolves of New Spain vary like the European wolf for even in this country they are not all marked according to our description some of them being of a uniform colour and even totally white  Cuetlachtli seu lupus Indicus Jo Fabri Xoloitscuintli Forma colore moribus et mole corporis lupo nostrati similis est atque adeo ejus ut mihi quidem videtur speciei sed ampliori capite

formerly remarked that in Peru and Mexico before the arrival of the Europeans there were domestic animals called  alco  which were nearly of the same size and dispositions with our small dogs and that from this conformity and because they were equally faithful and attached to their masters the Spaniards gave them the name of  Mexican  or  Peruvian dogs  The species of these animals indeed seems not to differ essentially from that of the dog Besides the word  alco  might perhaps be a generic and not a specific term Recchi has left us a figure of one of these alcos which in the Mexican language was called  Ytzcuinte Porzotli  It was prodigiously fat and probably degraded by its domestic state and by too much nourishment The head is represented to be so small that it has no proportion to the size of the body Its ears are pendulous which is another mark of slavery The muzzle resembles that of a dog the fore part of the head is white and the ears are pretty yellow The neck is so short that there is no interval between the head  and shoulders The back is arched and covered with yellow hair The tail is white short and pendulous and descends no lower than the thighs The belly is large tense and marked with black spots It has six conspicuous paps The legs and feet are white and the toes like those of the dog are armed with long sharp claws  Ytzcuinte porzotli Canis MexicanaAd unguem animal quod hic prostat nanum pingue et mansuetum effigiatum mihi videtur illud esse quod Americani nomine communi Alco vocabant  Hernand Hist Mex p    et    fig p    Fabri who gives this description concludes after a long dissertation that this animal is the same with the  alco  and I believe his conclusion is well founded But this appellation must not be regarded as exclusive for there is another race of dogs in America to which it applies with equal propriety Beside the dogs Fernandes remarks which the Spaniards transported from Europe to America there are three other species which are pretty similar to ours both in their nature and dispositions neither is their figure altogether different The first and largest of these American dogs is called  Xoloiztcuintli  He is often three cubits long and what is remarkable he is totally destitute of hair and only covered with a soft close skin marked with yellow and blue spots The second is covered with hair and of the size of our small Maltese dogs He is marked with  white black and yellow His deformity though singular is not disagreeable His back is arched and his neck so short that it seems to proceed immediately from the shoulders He is named in his own country  michuacanens  The third which likewise resembles our small dogs is called  techichi  But he has a wild and melancholy aspect The Americans eat his flesh  Fernand Hist Anim Nov Hisp p cap et p cap    From comparing the testimonies of Fabri and Fernandes it is obvious that the second dog which this last author calls  michuacanens  is the same with the  ytzcuinte porzotli  and that this species of animal existed in America before the arrival of the Europeans and the same must have been the case with the  techichi  I am persuaded therefore that the word  alco  was a generic name which applied equally to both and perhaps to other races or varieties that we are unacquainted with But as to the first Fernandes seems to have been deceived both with regard to the name and the animal No author mentions naked dogs in New Spain This race commonly called  Turkish dogs  come from India and other warm climates of the Old Continent and it is probable that those seen in America by Fernandes had been transported thither especially as he mentions his having seen this kind in Spain before his departure for America The proof is still farther corroborated  by the circumstance of this animal's having no American name Fernandes gives it the borrowed one of  Xoloitzcuintli  which is the name of the Mexican wolf Thus of these three species or varieties of American dogs there remain only two which are called indiscriminately  alco  for independent of the far alco which served as a lapdog to the Peruvian ladies there was a meagre and melancholy alco which was employed in the chace and it is by no means impossible that the three races apparently different from those of our dogs spring from the same stock The dogs of Lapland Siberia Iceland c must have passed like the foxes and wolves from the one Continent to the other and degenerated by the influence of the climate and a domestic state The first  alco  with the short neck approaches the Iceland dog and the  techichi  of New Spain is perhaps the same animal with the  koupara  Canis ferus major cancrosus vulgo dictus  koupara    Barrère    Franc Equin p    or  crabdog  of Guiana which in figure resembles the fox and in hair the jackal He has been called the  crabdog  because he chiefly lives upon crabs and other crustaceous animals I have seen only one skin of this Guiana animal and I am unable to determine whether it is a particular species or whether it should be referred to those of the dog fox or jackal  XV  THE TAYRA GALERA OR GUINEY WEASEL  Guiney weasel with the upper jaw much longer than the lower eyes placed midway between the ears and tip of the nose ears like the human tongue rough tail declining downwards lesseuing towards the point feet strong

appressis  Brown's Hist of Jamaica    p    tab      THIS animal of which Mr Brown has given a figure and description is of the size of a small rabbit and has a considerable resemblance to the weasel or martin He digs an habitation in the earth and has great strength in his forefeet which are much shorter than those behind His muzzle is long a little sharp and garnished with whiskers The under jaw is much shorter than the upper He has six cutting and two canine teeth in each jaw without reckoning the grinders His tongue is rough like that of the cat His head is oblong as well as the eyes which last are placed at an equal distance between the ears and the point of the muzzle His ears  are flat and resemble those of man His feet are strong and adapted for digging The metatarsal bones are long and he has five toes on all his feet His tail is long and tapers to a point His body is oblong and has a great resemblance to that of a large rat He is covered with brown hairs some of which are longer than others This animal appears to be a small species of martin or polecat Linnaeus imagined that the black weasel of Brasil might be the  galera  of Mr Brown and indeed the two descriptions afford some reason for the conjecture  Mustela atra collo subtus macula alba triloba Habitat in Brasilia  Holmens Confer Brown    Jam    tab    fig  Galera statura martis at nigra pilis rigidioribus auriculae rotundae villosae Area ante oculos cinerascens maculae sub medio collo non vero sub gula Mammae pone umbilicum quatuor  Nota  Mr Brown says that he saw only two paps on the lower part of the belly but the other two might escape his observation He also says that the galera is found in Guiney and the black weasel in Brasil But this assertion ought not to stumble us for it happens daily that Brasilian animals are first transported to Guiney and afterward pass for animals belonging to that country and  vice versa  I agree therefore with Linnaeus in thinking that the galera of Mr Brown is the same animal with the black weasel of Brasil  Besides this black weasel of Brasil is likewise found in Guiana where it is called  tayra  Mustela maxima atra Moschum redolens Tayra Grosse belette This animal by rubbing itself against trees leaves a kind of unctuous humour which has a strong odour of musk  Barrère    Franc Equin p    and I suspect that the word  galera  is a  corruption derived from  tayra  which is the true name of this animal  XVI  THE MERIAN OPOSSUM  Merian opossum with long sharp pointed naked ears head and upper part of the body of a yellowish brown colour the belly

CAVY  THE akouchi is pretty common in Guiana and other parts of South America It differs from the agouti by having a tail which is wanting in the agouti The akouchi is generally smaller than the agouti and its hair is not red but of an olive colour  Cuniculis minor caudatus olivaceus  Akouchi Barrère    hist nat de la Fr Equin p      These are the only differences we know between the akouchi and agouti which however seem to be sufficient to constitute two distinct species  SUPPLEMENT  In the original work we remarked that the akouchi was a different species from the agouti because the former had a tail and the latter had no tail The akouchi differs from the agouti still more in magnitude being no larger than a young rabbit of six months old The akouchi is found only in extensive woods He feeds on the same fruits and has nearly the same manners with the agouti In the islands of Saint Lucia and Grenada he is called  agouti  His flesh is white and has the flavour of a young rabbit and he is ranked amongst the finest game in South America When the akouchis are pursued by dogs rather than take the water they allow themselves to be taken M de la Borde informs us though I doubt the fact that the females produce only one or at most two young at a litter They are easily tamed and have a small cry like that of the Guiney pig but it is seldom heard  We have given a figure of this animal drawn from a well preserved skin Messrs Aublet and Olivier assure me that in Cayenne the hare is called  agouti  and the rabbit  akouchi  but that the agouti is the best food and speaking of the game of this country they inform me that  Plate CCXCII ACOUCHI  the armadillos are still better food except the ninebanded armadillo which has a strong smell of musk that after the armadillos the paca is the best game because its flesh is wholesome and fat The next in order are the agouti and akouchi They likewise maintain that the red couguar is used as food and that its flesh has the taste of veal  XVIII  The TUCAN or MEXICAN SHREW  Mexican shrew with a sharp nose small round ears without sight two long fore teeth above and below thick fat fleshy body short legs so that the belly almost touches the ground long crooked claws tawny hair short tail length from nose to tail nine inches  Pennant's synops of quad p      FERNANDES has given the name of  Tucan  to a small quadruped of New Spain whose size figure and natural habits make it approach nearer to the mole than to any other species It appears to be the same animal described by Seba under the denomination of the  red mole  of America  Seba vol p tab fig  at least the descriptions of the two  authors correspond sufficiently to justify this conjecture The tucan is perhaps somewhat larger than our mole It is equally fat and fleshy and its legs are so short that the belly touches the ground The tail is short the ears are small and round and the eyes are so minute that they can scarcely be of any use to the animal But it differs from the mole in the colour of the hair which is reddish yellow and in the number of toes having only three before and four behind while the mole has five toes on all the feet It seems to differ from the mole in other articles Its flesh is good eating and it possesses not the instinct of discovering its retreat after having once left it but at every time is obliged to dig a new hole so that in certain soils which are agreeable to these animals  Fernand hist anim Nov Hisp p cap  the holes are so numerous and so near each other that circumspection is necessary to walk there with safety  XIX  The BRASILIAN SHREW  Brasilian shrew with a sharp nose and teeth pendulous scrotum It is of a dusky colour marked along the back with three broad black strokes The length from nose to tail five inches that of the tail two  Pennant's Synops of quad p    Mus araneus figura muris  Marcgr Brasil p      WE mention this animal under the denomination of the  Brasilian shrew  because we are ignorant of its proper name and it has a greater resemblance to the shrew than to any other animal It is however considerably larger being about five inches long from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail which is not two inches and consequently is proportionally shorter than that of the common shrew It has a pointed muzzle and very sharp teeth Upon a brown groundcolour three pretty large black bands extend longitudinally from the head to the tail under which the scrotum appears hanging between the hind feet This animal says Marcgrave sports with the cats who discover no inclination to eat it In the same manner the cats kill the European shrews but never eat them  XX  THE ROCK CAVY  Rock cavy with divided upper lip short ears four toes on the fore feet and three on the hind Colour of the upper part of the body like that of the common hare belly white The length one foot  Pennant's synops of quad p    Aperea  Brasiliensibus nobis vel  dratte

long by seven inches in circumference Its general colour is the same with that of our hares and its belly is white Its upper lipe is divided in the same manner and it has the same large cutting teeth and whiskers round the mouth and on the sides of the eyes But its ears are rounded like those of the rat and so short that they exceed not the height of a finger's breadth The fore legs are not above three inches in length and those behind are a little longer The fore feet have four toes covered with a black skin and armed with small short claws The hind feet have only three toes and the middle one is the longest  It has no tail Its head is somewhat longer than that of the hare and its flesh is like that of the rabbit which it resembles in its manner of living  Mrcgrav hist nat Brasil p  It likewise retires into holes It does not however dig the earth like the rabbit but conceals itself in the clefts of rocks Hence it is easily seized in its retreat It is hunted as game and its flesh is preferable to that of our best rabbits  Piso hist Brasil p  The animal mentioned by Oviedo and afterwards by Charlevoix  Oviedo remarks that the  cori  resembles a small rabbit and that some of them are totally white and others a mixture of different colours  Hist de St Dominique    par le P Charlevoix    tom    p    and du Perrier de Montfraisier under the denomination of  cori  appears to be the same with the  aperea  or rock cavy  The  cori  is a small quadruped somewhat resembling our rabbits and moles It has small ears which it carries so flatly reclined backward that it is difficult to perceive them It has no tail Some of them are white others black and others spotted with black and white Some of them are totally red and others spotted with red and white They are tamed and never defile the houses They eat herbage and are easily maintained Their flesh has the taste and flavour of the best rabbits  Hist des voyages    par Duperrier de Monifraizier    p    In some parts of the West Indies these animals may perhaps be reared in warrens or in houses like our rabbits and this may be the reason why some of them are red white black and variegated This conjecture is not without foundation for Garcilasso informs us that in Peru  there are wild and domestic rabbits which have no resemblance to those of Spain  Hist des Incas tom p    XXI  THE TAPETI or BRASILIAN HARE  Brasilian

 Some other species of animals might be added to the preceding list but the accounts given of them are so vague that I choose rather to confine myself to what is known with some degree of certainty than to give way to conjecture or to exhibit creatures of imagination as real species But notwithstanding this limitation intelligent men will easily perceive that my history of quadrupeds is as complete as they could possibly expect It comprehends a great number of new animals and none of those who were formerly known are omitted  The preceding notices though composed of twentyone articles contain not above nine or ten distinct species for all the others are only varieties The white bear is only a variety of the common kind the Tartarian cow of the bison the Guinea and CapeVerd hogs of the common hog c Hence by adding these ten species to about one hundred and eighty whose history we have given the total number of quadrupeds the existence of which is properly ascertained exceeds not two hundred species upon the surface of the whole known world  ADDITIONS from the Supplementary Volume  THE CRABEATER  Cayenne opossum with a long slender face ears erect pointed and short the coat woolly mixed with very coarse hairs threè inches long of a dirty white from the roots to the middle from thence to the ends of a deep brown sides and belly of a pale yellow legs of a dusky brown thumb on each foot distinct on the toes of the fore feet and thumb on the hind are nails on the toes of the hind feet crooked claws tail very long taper naked and scaly Length seventeen inches that of the tail fifteen and a half The subject measured was very young  Pennant's synops of quad Edit    p    Canis ferus major Cancrosus vulgo dictus Koupara  Barrère    Franc Equin p      THE name  crabeater  or  crabdog  has been given to this animal because crabs are his principal food He has a very little relation to the dog or fox to which some travellers have compared him He seems to be more nearly allied to the opossums but he is much larger and the female crabeater carries not her young like the female opossum in a pouch under her belly Hence the crabeater appears to be a detached species and different from all those we have formerly described  In the figure the long naked scaly tail the large thumbs without claws on the hind feet  and the flat claws on the fore feet are remarkable This animal whose skin is preserved in the royal cabinet was young when it was transmitted to us It is a male and the following is a description of it  The length of the whole body from the nose to the origin of the tail is about seventeen inches Before it is six inches three lines high and six inches and a half behind The tail which is grayish scaly and naked is fifteen inches and a half long ten lines in circumference at the origin and gradually tapers to a point  As the legs of this animal are very short he has at a distance some resemblance to a terrier The head is not very different from that of a dog and exceeds not four inches one line in length from the point of the nose to the occiput The eye is not large the edges of the eyebrows are black and above the eye there are hairs of an inch and a quarter in length There are similar hairs on the side of the cheek near the ear The whiskers are black and about an inch and a half long The opening of the mouth is near two inches The upper jaw is armed on each side with a crooked canine tooth which reaches beyond the under jaw The ear is brown naked broad and round at the extremity  The hair on the body is woolly and interspersed with other long stiff black hairs These  long hairs increase upon the thighs and the spine of the back which is totally covered with them and form a kind of mane from the middle of the back to the origin of the tail They are three inches long of a dirty white colour from the base to the middle and afterwards of a dark brown as far as the point The hair on the sides as well as on the belly is yellowish white but it approaches more to yellow toward the shoulders and on the thighs neck breast and head where this yellow tincture is mixed in some places with brown The sides of the neck are yellow and the legs and feet are of a blackish brown colour There are five toes on each foot The fore foot is an inch and three quarters long the largest toe nine lines and the furrowed claw two lines The toes are a little bended like those of the rat the thumb alone being straight The hind feet are an inch and eight lines long the largest toe nine lines and the thumb half an inch The thumb is thick broad and at a distance from the toes as in the apes The nail of the thumb is flat but those of the other toes are crooked and reach beyond their points The thumb of the fore foot is straight and not removed from the other toe  M de la Borde informs me that this animal is very common in Cayenne and that it always frequents the savannahs and other marshy places  'It climbs trees' he remarks 'with great dexterity and continues oftener upon them than on the ground especially during the day It has fine teeth and defends itself against the dogs Crabs are its principal nourishment and it is always fat When unable to draw the crabs from their holes with its foot it introduces the tail which it uses as a hook The crab sometimes lays hold of the tail and makes the animal cry This cry has some resemblance to that of a man and is heard at a great distance But its ordinary voice is a kind of grunting like pigs The female produces four or five young at a litter and deposits them in the hollows of old trees The natives of the country eat its flesh which resembles that of a hare These animals are easily tamed and they are fed in the houses like dogs and cats with all kinds of victuals Hence their taste for crabs is by no means exclusive'  It is alledged that there are two species of crabeaters in Cayenne The first is the animal we have already described The other is not only a different species but belongs to a different genus Its tail is totally covered with hair and it seizes crabs with its paws only These two animals resemble each other in the head alone and they differ in the figure and proportions of the body as well as in the structure of the feet and claws  Plate CCXCIII CRAB EATER  Plate CCXCIV ANONYMOUS ANIMAL  ANONYMOUS ANIMAL  WE here give the figure of an undescribed animal the drawing of which was made by the Chevalier Bruce who permitted me to copy it This animal which we shall call  anonymous  till we learn its real name has some similarities to the hare and others to the squirrel Mr Bruce gave the following account of it in writing  In Lybia on the south side of the lake formerly called  Palus Tritonides  there is a very singular animal from nine to ten inches long with ears nearly as long as the half of the body and proportionally broad a circumstance which takes place in no other quadruped except the longeared bat Its muzzle resembles that of the fox and yet it seems to approach nearer to that of the squirrel It lives on the palmtrees of which it eats the fruit It has short retractile claws and is a very beautiful creature Its colour is white mixed with a little gray and a bright yellow The inside of the ears is naked in the middle only They are covered with brown hair mingled with yellow and garnished within with large white hairs The end of the nose is black the tail yellow and black at the point The tail is pretty  long but of a different form from that of the squirrel and all the hair both on the body and tail is very soft  MADAGASCAR RAT  IN the figure is represented a small animal from Madagascar which was drawn alive when in the possession of the Countess of Marsan It appeared to make a nearer approach to the species of the palmsquirrel than to that of the rat for I was assured that it frequented the palmtrees I have not been able to procure farther information concerning this animal It may be remarked however that as its claws did not project it seemed to constitute a species very different from that of the rat and to approach nearer to the palmsquirrel To this animal may be referred the rat on the southwest coast of Madagascar mentioned by the Dutch voyagers for they tell us that these rats live in the palmtrees and eat the dates that their body is long their muzzle sharp their legs short and their tail long and spotted  Recueil des voyages qui ont servi à l'établissement de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales tom p  These characters correspond so well with those represented in the figure of our Madagascar rat as to induce us  Plate CCXCV MADAGASCAR RAT  to believe that the animal formerly mentioned belongs to this species  It lived several years with the Countess of Marsan Its movements were extremely brisk and its cry was nearly similar though much weaker than that of the squirrel Like the squirrels it carried its food to its mouth with the fore paws erected its tail and leaped about It bit desperately and could not be tamed It was fed with almonds and fruits It never came out of its cage except in the night and it endured the winters very well in an apartment where the cold was moderated by a small fire  THE END  As the  COUNT DE BUFFON  has observed no systematic order in his History of Quadrupeds the following Index in which the Animals are arranged according to the
