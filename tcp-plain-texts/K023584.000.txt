 INTRODUCTION  TO SHAKESPEARE's PLAYS CONTAINING AN ESSAY ON ORATORY  LONDON Printed for JOHN BELL near ExeterExchange in the Strand and C ETHERINGTON at York MDCCLXXIII  DEDICATION TO DAVID GARRICK  Esq  SIR  IT is matter of great doubt whether any dedicatory address was ever freer from taint of flattery than the present if we pronounce you the best illustrator of and the best  living comment  on SHAKESPEARE that ever has appeared or possibly ever will grace the British stage it is merely echoing the public voice and concurring with that unparalleled unanimity of praise which during so long a course of years hath attended your incomparable merit  This compact edition of SHAKESPEARE is offered you as a grateful tho' small return for the infinite pleasure and extensive information derived from your exquisite performance and judicious remarks by  SIR  Your most obedient humble servants THE EDITORS  ADVERTISEMENT  SHAKESPEARE's admirers even the enthusiastic ones who worship him as  the god of their idolatry  have never scrupled to admit that his most regular pieces produce some scenes and passages highly derogatory to his incomparable general merit he frequently trifles is now and then obscure and sometimes to gratify a vitiated age indelicate but can any degree of critical taste wish the preservation of dark spots because they have grown upon dramatic sunshine is not the corrective hand frequently proved to be the kindest critics like parents should neither spare the rod nor use it wantonly  There is no doubt but all our author's faults may justly be attributed to the loose quibbling licentious taste of his time he no doubt upon many occasions wrote wildly merely to gratify the public as DRYDEN wrote bombastically and CONGREVE obscenely to indulge the humour and engage the favour of their audiences no man can suppose that the former considered his rhiming dialogues as marks of sublimity nor that the latter imagined his  double entendres  were wit one wanted money the other fame for which pompous sounds and gross ideas were then popular baits consequently chaste criticism and delicacy were without scruple sacrificed to their several views  Our author did not go quite so far but very frequently preserved himself free from taint reining his fiery PEGASUS with an able masterly hand why then should not the noble monuments he has left us of unrivalled ability be restored to due proportion and natural lustre by sweeping off those cobwebs and that dust of depraved opinion which SHAKESPEARE was unfortunately forced to throw on them forced we say for it is no strain of imagination to suppose that the Goths and Vandals of criticism who frequented the theatre in his days would like those who overran the  Roman  empire have destroyed and consigned to barbarous oblivion the sublime beauties which they could not relish and it is matter of great question with us whether the fool in  King Lear  was not a more general favourite than the old monarch himself  The above considerations first started the idea and induced the undertaking of this edition and as the THEATRES especially  of late have been generally right in their omissions of this author particularly we have printed our  text  after their regulations and from this part of our design an evident use will arise that those who take books to the THEATRE will not be so puzzled themselves to accompany the speaker nor so apt to condemn performers of being imperfect when they pass over what is designedly omitted Upon this point however it is to be observed that the difference of power of voice and execution between different performers may make one erase more than another nevertheless we come so near the mark of all that scarce any perplexity can arise in tracing them besides we would hope that a reasonable standard being thus laid down professors of the drama will not be so forward as capriciously and arbitrarily to deviate from it it is commendable to consult the extent of expression but thro' idleness to retrench what is beautiful and necessary or through vanity to retain what is heavy and unessential to action we deem an affront to the public and a disgrace to the performer  As an author replete with spirited ideas and a full flow of language especially one possessing  a muse of fire  cannot stop exactly where stage utterance and public attention  require some passages of great merit for the closet are never spoken such though omitted in the text we have carefully preserved in the notes  And now being upon this part of our subject we hold ourselves bound in justice and gratitude to Mr  Garrick  to mention a delicate fear which he suggested when we first solicited his sanction and assistance This fear was lest the prunings transpositions or other alterations which in his province as a manager he had often found necessary to make or adopt with regard to the text for the convenience of representation or accommodation to the powers and capacities of his performers might be misconstrued into a critical presumption of offering to the literati a reformed and more correct edition of our author's works this being by no means his intention we hope it will not become liable to such an unmerited misconstruction In justification of ourselves also we take this opportunity of declaring that to expect any thing more of this work than as  a companion to the theatre  is to mistake the purpose of the editors  Having been long convinced that multiplying conjectural verbal criticisms tends rather to perplex than inform readers we  have given those readings which to us appear most consonant to our author's manner and meaning without obtruding one capricious opinion on another  We have furnished an explanation of technical and obsolete terms pointed out the leading beauties as they occur without descanting so much as to anticipate the reader's conception and investigation we have shewn with a becoming impartiality what appear to us to be blemishes and imperfections the requisites for representing every character of importance are defined and the mode of performance essential for scenes peculiarly capital is clearly pointed out  We have earnestly consulted correctness neatness ornament utility and cheapness of price we have avoided all ostentation of criticism compacting our notes as much as possible in regard whereof it may be justly said that we could have enlarged the number and extended the phraseology with much less trouble than it cost us to give them their present form it has been our peculiar endeavour to render what we call the essence of SHAKESPEARE more instructive and intelligible especially to the ladies and to youth glaring indecencies being removed and intricate passages explained  and lastly we have striven to supply plainer ideas of criticism both in public and private than we have hitherto met with  A general view of each play is given by way of introduction  Though this is not an edition meant for the profoundly learned nor the deeply studious who love to find out and chace their own critical game yet we flatter ourselves both parties may perceive fresh ideas started for speculation and reflection  THE EDITORS  ESSAY ON ORATORY  THOUGH it is not strictly within the limits of our plan to range at large over the extensive field of oratorical correctness fancy and excellence as it respects the pulpit senate and bar yet it is hoped we shall so far touch on the essentials of them all as to give hints which may prove useful to each of the three degrees  If we say that an orator like a poet to excel should be born such it will be no strained assertion and if we add that he must be more indebted to nature than a son of the muses it will be easily admitted Cultivated imagination regulated by judgment constitutes one who totally void of external requisites may shine from his closet tho' ever so deformed in figure rude in features weak in voice or blemish'd in appearance  The other though he may by peculiar excellence of delivery and the help of a feeling subject well treated on be able to impress an audience with little more than a good voice yet experience powerfully convinces us that a graceful person respectable marking features expressive eyes and ornamental gesture are of the utmost utility it is no argument to say that a man as in the case of Sir  John Fielding  tho' the visual gates of sympathy be shut may show strong marks of oratorical merit for the question naturally follows would he not be much more powerful in expression if the indexes of thought enjoyed their natural and proper vigour especially where particular feelings are to be excited  It is too common for ignorance and avarice to misapply the talents of youth especially in this point of view many are destined for and brought up to the most serious the most important concerns of life wherein public speaking is required who labour under glaring defects and imbecilities of expression hence so many drowsy irksome preachers so many senatorical cyphers and such a number of imperfect pleaders this parental blunder is much the same as breeding a purblind boy to watchmaking or one hard of hearing to music  Supposing a person qualified by nature let us see how far art may be called in The complete orator must have a general and intimate knowledge of himself the world and mankind a clear conception of the passions and affections of those he is to instruct and persuade a perfect acquaintance with the various distinctions of virtue and vice he should be critically intimate with all the beauties and blemishes of the ancient writers he should  be an historian and a logician possessing a correct idea of and taste for the liberal arts if a competent knowledge of the mechanical ones is added so much the better he should possess a quick conception and a retentive memory he should be able to break thro' with ease the cobwebs of sophistry and above all enjoy that grand ingredient recommended by CICERO social philosophy  He should be master of all the arguments for and against his subject in short to sum up all with the great  Roman  orator's own words  "he should be furnished with logical acuteness philosophical wisdom and poetical imagination embellished with the most polished elocution and gesture of the stage"  To expatiate upon the obvious advantages deriveable from each of the above qualifications required to complete this very comprehensive character we are considering would be to spin out a needless length of explanation which could answer no end but anticipating the reader's reflective investigation wherefore we shall quit this point with observing that when so many requisites both internal and external are necessary it is no wonder that a complete orator is so very scarce a character  Declaimers who may be justly stiled the pageants of oratory possess the flowery but not the argumentative part they appeal boldly to fancy and the passions but cautiously shun rational inquisition shew and plausibility completely  set  up one of this dangerous kind of public speakers who oftener make proselytes among the weak and ignorant than sound orators do as they are mostly pleasing tho' seldom instructive Bishop  Sprat  speaking of them in his history of the  Royal Society    emphatically says  "of all the studies of men nothing can be sooner obtained than a vicious abundance of phrase the trick of metaphors and a volubility of tongue"  Having come thus far the three celebrated orators of antiquity seem to fall in the way DEMOSTHENES ISOCRATES and CICERO the first spoke from the heart the second from the head the first was animated by his subject and powerfully enforced it the second decked it profusely with rhetorical flowers one flashed conviction by irresistable imagery the other amused imagination with fantastical allusions of ISOCRATES we may say his eloquence resembled a pleasant but shallow stream which tickles the ear with an agreeable murmuring DEMOSTHENES a deep majestic current that in its course thunders on attention and bears down all opposition ISOCRATES possesses ease and elegance DEMOSTHENES power and perswasion CICERO who rises far above the former does not in our idea come up to the latter he is however a very masterly mixture of both and therefore more likely to obtain general admiration than either of his predecessors  Oratory is well defined  the exercise of eloquence  eloquence the  fluency of speech  and rhetoric the  guide of both  It is odd that these three terms should frequently be used as synonimous when they so essentially differ  Oratorical composition should be founded on a progressive unity of parts but not like some of our sermons which are disgraced with insipid methodical formality commonly stiled  heads  it should enter modestly upon warm into the subject and if required kindle to fire when the audience are ready to receive heated impressions an impassioned  exordium generally produces a cold conclusion and that piece which endeavours to catch attention too suddenly will either not catch it at all or be obliged soon to let it slip  FENELON ARCHBISHOP OF CAMBRAY describing the Beauties of Eloquence speaks to the following effect  "Of what use can any ornament be that does not tend to prove to paint or to affect those ornaments which only please are false beauties those which please and persuade solid ones the just and natural emotions of an orator have much grace and beauty in them his correct and spirited painting charms us all the essential parts of eloquencce tend to please but merely pleasing is not the most important aim ideas and expressions which only tickle the ear may be deemed quaint turns all graces of style which serve to invigorate persuasion are to be wish'd for but all witty punning conceits all quibbling upon words all strained metaphors all forced glaring imagery and all luxurance of idea which only serve to flash and glitter upon fancy disgrace sound oratory"  In public speaking as well as in poetry and painting art should be carefully concealed where perceptible it has a coarse and mean aspect The orator should so intirely possess his audience of the subject as to make them forget the speaker  From the affecting exclamation of  Gracchus  mentioned by  Cicero  and a dilation of it we perceive how expression strengthens or enervates a subject  "Wretched man that I am whither shall I turn myself where can I go to the Capitol it swims with my brother's blood shall I go to to my own house there to see my wretched mother dissolved in tears and overwhelmed with  sorrow"  This is a beautiful bold and affecting picture of perplexed grief mark how faded the tints of originality appear in the following faint copy  "I know not where to go nor whither I shall turn myself amidst my misfortunesthe Capitol is the place where my brother's blood was shed and at home I shall find my unhappy mother lamenting her sad condition"  With very narrow comprehension and very dull feelings we may readily perceive the falling off in this languid extension and variation of phrase  We shall offer an instance of the turgid and chaste in the following comparative contrast Suppose a person addressing an  English  audience on a presumed decay of  English  liberty should thus declaim  "Most renowned  Britons  in the magnanimous volume of Time we may readeven purblind eyes may see the glaring type that there was a period when liberty diaphanous as sunbeams at noon exhilarated this oceanic isle when like the bird of  Jove  it soar'd aloft and gazed with pleasure on the face of day now it faintly glimmers like the fogwrapped moon and our glorious eagle is become a bird of night"  Now let us see how the same subject may be treated in opposition to this overcharged bloated tabernacle harangue which delivered in the  Moorfield  manner must prove a laughable morsel of mirth to divert common sense and astonish ignorance  "Fellow citizens there was a time when liberty diffused its blessings thro' this once happy isle when its value was known and its worth revered when like the sun it was a common  comforter the parent of pleasure ease and security now corruption and our own depravity have brought it to so enfeebled and precarious a state that every real friend of his country must tremble as I do at the painful idea of its speedy and inevitable dissolution"  If eloquence a very dangerous weapon in the hands of illdesigning men is used to any other purposes than the following we may consider it as in a censurable state of perversion  It should enforce the clearest proof of any useful truth with such interesting motives as may affect the hearers and work their passions to virtuous purposes to raise indignation against ingratitude horror against cruelty detestation against vice abhorrence against slavery compassion for misery love for virtue reverence for religion obedience to superiors and benevolence to all Thus employed eloquence appears in its full force and beauty mere harangues seldom fail to catch the ear but rarely touch the heart and as seldom inform the head  It is necessary that an orator should call the passions to his aid but then he should be very cautious not to impose on or assail them too violently the one is cruel the other impolitic He should be clear in his ideas and concise in his expression he should perfectly understand just arrangement of matter and the proper climax of argument he should be thoroughly possessed of every principle and part of his subject he should provide a sufficient number of apposite affecting figures Thus prepared he must speak and effectually from an untrammel'd imagination  The following passages from Bishop  Burnet  's discourse on the Pastoral Care seems well calculated  for the improvement of Lay as well as Pulpit speakers  "The extempore orator should frequently converse with himself to let his thoughts flow freely from him especially when he feels an edge and heat upon his mind for then happy expressions will spontaneously come to his mouth He must also write essays on all kinds of subjects for by writing he will bring himself to a facility and correctness of thinking and speaking and thus by close application for two or three years a man may render himself such a master this way that he can never be surprized nor will new thoughts ever dry up upon him If in his meditations happy thoughts and noble pathetic expressions offer themselves he must not lose but write them down"  We perfectly agree with the right reverend Author that much oratorical merit may be derived from frequent wellregulated soliloquies and essaywriting and are induced to offer a few more of his thoughts though not in the exact words nor confined light wherein he has proposed them  One most essential point is that an orator should have a due and deep sense of the truth and utility of his subject he must have a life and glow in his thoughts with relation to it he should very sensibly feel in himself those things which he explains and recommends to others he should speak as if what he uttered came from the heart the orator unless he really is or seems to be in earnest will never make any material impression There is a degree of authority even in the simplest matters that can be treated of if they appear genuine while the most important points fall into neglect when conveyed through the cold vehicle of languid expression  For a general wellcompacted idea of oratory we shall refer to some speeches from FENELON's Dialogue between DEMOSTHENES and CICERO  CICERO  What dost thou pretend that I was but an ordinary orator  DEMOSTHENES  Not an ordinary one for it is not over an ordinary person that I affect superiority Thou wert doubtless a celebrated orator thou hadst great parts but didst frequently deviate from "the point wherein perfection consists  CICERO  And pray hadst thou no faults at all  DEMOSTHENES  I believe I can be taxed with none in point of eloquence  CICERO  Canst thou compare richness of genius with me thou who art dry unadorned who art ever confined within narrow and contracted limits thou dost not amplify any subject thou from whom nothing can be retrenched so impoverished so starved is the manner in which thy subjects are treated whereas I extended mine displaying a copious and fertile genius which gave judicious critics occasion to say that nothing could be added to my works  DEMOSTHENES  He from whom nothing can be retrenched has said nothing but what is perfect  CICERO  He to whom nothing can be added has omitted nothing that could adorn his work  DEMOSTHENES  Thou findest thy discourses more replete with  flashes of wit than mineconfess honestly is not this thy claim to superiority  CICERO  Since you urge the point I acknowledge it my compositions are infinitely more beautified than thine They speak far more wit more ingenuity of turn more art more ease I exhibit the same thing under twenty different shapes when people heard my orations they could not help admiring my parts nor being surprized at my art they were constantly shouting and interrupting me with vehemence of applause Thou must have been heard very quietly with I suppose little or no interruption  DEMOSTHENES  Thy observations on both are true but the inference drawn from them is thy mistake Thou took'st up the audience with thyself I engaged it only with the affairs I spoke upon People admired thee I was forgot by the auditors who saw nothing but the course I wish'd them to take Thou didst entertain with flashes of wit I struck down with bolts of thunder Thou madest men say How finely he speaks I made them exclaim Come let us take the field against  Philip  They praised thee they were too much dispossessed of themselves to praise me Thy harangues came forth adorned none ever discovered in me any ornament there was nothing in my pieces but precise strong clear argument and thence impulses like lightning which nothing could resist Thou wert a perfect orator when thou wert like mesimple grave austere without apparent art in a word when thou wert  Demosthenical  but when wit turn and art shone in thy discourses  then wert mere  Cicero  departing so far from perfection as thou departedst from my character  Mr RAPIN in his Reflections upon Eloquence observes that there are two extremes which should be equally and carefully avoided the frigid style and the boyish The former renders discourses dry and insipid by a languid flatness of expression the latter ungrateful and shocking by a turgid loftiness and affected amplification Those who use the frigid style call in pompous expressions when the subject requires plain ones and they who affect the boyish one employ low expressions in the loftiest themes The frigid style properly includes all such expressions as are too strong or too sparkling strained metaphors and frequent witticisms the boyish style comprehends strokes of humour and quaint conceits upon serious subjects loose and heavy repetitions in that part of an oration which ought to be close and concise too violent exaggerations and too laborious figures  One would think that MALBRANCHE had the enthusiastic religionmongers of those days in view when he observed that one of the greatest and most remarkable proofs of the strong influence that some heated imaginations have over others is the power of extensive persuasion without a shadow of proof  False eloquence like the prisniatic glass  Its gaudy colours spreads on every place  The face of nature we no more survey  All glares alike without distinction gay  But true expression like the unchanging sun  Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon  It gilds all objects but it alters none  Expression is the dress of thought and still  Appears more decent as more suitable  POPE on Criticism    Stage  delivery  for theatrical expression cannot be stiled  oratory  including more variety and more force of passion is consequently more difficult It requires the finest and most significant feelings in the performer to create by sympathy proper sensations in the audience  That noble and almost peculiar sense of human nature Sympathy makes us not only share in the distress of a fellow creature but also pity the miserable brute it varies shapes and strength according to the objects and circumstances which occur There are two principal degrees sympathy of compulsion and sympathy of election the first is when irresistable motives arrest the heart the second when it becomes interested by choice Compulsive sympathy instructs us to sigh with successless love to kindle with real or well painted rage to weep with grief and to mourn for virtue in distress elective sympathy is when we make choice of objects in different situations and become without any personal knowledge or immediate concern anxious for their success in cases of competition whether of a pleasurable or of a serious nature man cannot remain a spectator totally indifferent he must assist one side or the other with a sympathetic wish in the choice he is free yet that choice is frequently so capricious that no firm reason can be offered why it becomes fixed  Imagination is the vehicle which conveys sympathy to and draws it meliorated from the heart that which the Theatre raises is produced by the bold painting of the Poet's pen aided by the natural and forcible talents of a good Actor who is in every sentence an illustrative comment upon his author's idea  This is that kind of sympathy which the ingenious Dr SMITH in his Theory of Moral Sentiments describes to arise from the view of emotions in another person the passions may be transfused from one person to another instantaneously and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the person principally concerned Grief and Joy strongly expressed in the look and gestures of any one exclusive of voice at once affect the spectator with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion a smiling face is to every one who sees it a cheerful object as a sorrowful countenance on the other hand is a melancholy one  What the ingenious Professor says of mankind at large may be brought to the point we have immediately in view Every faculty in one man when he judges of propriety is the measure by which he decides upon the like faculty in another I judge of your sight by my sight of your ear by my ear of your reason by my reason of your resentment by my resentment of your love by my love I neither have nor can have any other way of judging about them This position granted we are not to wonder at the endless variety of and frequent absurd critical opinions upon the  real  and  mimic  stages of life  If an actor creates sympathy which to do should be his foremost aim he will command attention if not vain are the best requisites and all the adventitious aids of theatrical decoration  For what follows we have been obliged to a pamphlet written by Mr  GENTLEMAN  some few years since  READING and DECLAMATION consist of  emphasis climax modulation pauses breaks transitions tones cadences  and  gesture    EMPHASIS may be divided into two branches  explanatory  and  expressive  by the first is meant that stress of utterance which presents more clearly to conception the meaning of what we deliver as for example  "A  popular  man is in  truth  no better than a  prostitute  to  common fame  and to the  people  he lies down to  every  one he meets for the  hire  of  praise  and his  humility  is only a  disguised ambition  "  By marking the preceding passage  so  the meaning strikes immediately with full force whereas if the stress was laid upon other words or if the whole was uttered with  monotony  a sameness of tone the sense would be confused and to a hearer whose apprehension was not very quick perhaps quite unintelligibleIn cases where the sense is doubtful proper  emphasis  is indispensably necessary for instance "Did the Englishman deserve to dieIf I lay the stress upon  did  then it marks a question arising from surprise if  Englishman  is distinguished then it implies that  others  were concerned and that I would know  his  case  particularly  If  die  is marked then it appears that I  admit guilt  but want to know if his crime was of such a nature as to deserve  capital  punishment  Expressive emphasis  is that which we use to render a passage whose meaning is obvious more forcible  as may appear by properly marking the following quotation from Shakespeare  All words printed in  Italic  except proper names are those on which the  emphasis  is to be laid but words in CAPITALS require a more powerful emphasis    In  this  ye GODS you make the  weak most strong    In  this  ye GODS you  tyrants  do  defeat    Nor  stony tow'rs  nor  walls  of  beaten brass    Nor  airless dungeon  nor  strong links  of  iron    Can be  retentive  to the  strength  of  spirit  But  life  being  weary  of these worldly bars  Never  lacks  power  to  dismiss  itself  Let us take another example from an higher Epic  He bids the SPIRY  firs arise    The cedar  vig'rous pierce  the  skies    From Lebanon's  chill  brow  Fearless  amid  conflicting storms    The  tow'ring  stork his cradle forms  High  on the  sounding  bough    th  PSALM  By laying the  emphasis  on  spiry  in the first line the peculiar form of the trees mentioned is explained whereas had the stress been laid upon  firs  it would leave us at liberty to think upon  oaks elms  c spiry tooThe word  arise  is marked as being the purport of a command and though in general the voice falls at the end of a line yet in this case the meaning requires it should be raised but not too high nor abruptly  In the second line  vig'rous  is marked as a property of the cedar indeed all  epithets  whether  they precede or follow require  emphasisPierce  is noted as painting a quickness and boldness of vegetation while the imagination is raised to a more than ordinary height by particularising  skies    In the third line  chill  is distinguished as a characteristic quality of the climate of Lebanon  Fearless  in the fourth line is pointed out as an extraordinary attribute of a bird and  conflicting storms  are emphatical as a proof of that attribute enlarging the idea much more than the simple word  fearless  unassisted would have done  In the fifth line  tow'ring  is distinguished as an  epithet  and  cradle  which happily describes the  stork  's nest in that rocking situation is pointed out as the motive of the bird's resolution  In the last line  high  is marked as a material circumstance of the imagery and  sounding  not only as an  epithet  but also as referring to its turbulent situation among whistling or roaring gales  I have chosen the above stanza from the Psalms as picturesque poetry rests more upon  emphasis  than any other species of writing and I have been so minute in the explanation of it not only that my meaning might be understood as to this branch of expression but likewise to show that  emphasis  should be founded on reason not laid merely for a jingle or variation of soundHaving thus marked and explained one stanza I shall propose two more for the exercise of the student without any marks of distinction  He as a curtain stretch'd on high  The vast cerulean canopy  And gave with fires to glow  'Twas he tremendous Potentate  Built on the waves his hall of state  Wide as the waters flow  He walks upon the wings of wind  And leaves the rapid storms behind  Their monarch's awful will  Seraphs await in dread suspence  And swifter than the lightning's glance  His mighty word fulfil  After all that can be said the degrees of  emphasis  are so many and so variable that no  precise  rules can be laid down for their applicationIn  reading  and  declamation  as in  music  there must be taste to give beauty without it mere rectitude will be most unaffectingly insipid This quality though improveable must certainly be first derived from NatureA  reader  before he can reach bare propriety must thoroughly understand what he reads for which reason the custom of putting children to peruse the Bible in which there are many difficult words and abstruse passages is by no means to be commended nay if we consider it in another light it is highly blameable for by being made the subject of puzzle and embarrassment by being tossed about in a careless and slovenly manner that love and respect which the  sacred writings  justly claim are too frequently set aside in youth  This important point is very judiciously enforced by Mr  Hull  in a note on one of Mr  Preston  's Genuine Letters  "He objected to the absurd custom practised then as at this day of suffering children to  learn to read  from the  Bible  whence they too often contract a distaste to the most edifying and important volume that can in the process of their lives be laid before them"  Vol I Letter Page  We are told that among the  Turks if a piece of written paper appears on the ground it is taken up and carefully preserved lest the word ALLAH or GOD be inscribed on itMark the contrasted irreverence of Christians who not only profane with their mouths that most awful name upon the most trivial occasions but also frequently use as waste paper whole sheets in which not only his sacred name is mentioned but every letter a part of his  divine word    Another reason against making the Bible an early book among learners is the frequency of periods and peculiarity of style in which it differs widely from most other compositions It is not rare to find many persons who by laboriously conning over the chapters can stumble their way pretty tolerably through any part of it yet put them to any other book you shall find them lamentably hampered and frequently at an absolute stand  But to return more particularly to my subjectAs no absolute rules can be laid down for  emphasis  in general we must be content with remarks upon particular cases such as that opposition or  antithesis  requires an  emphasis  upon each of the opposed words and that most monosyllables beginning a question must be strongly marked as  Why  did he so  What  can he mean  How  did she look In compound words that are opposed to others the  emphasis  or rather  accent  properly falls on the distinguishing syllables for instance The  virtuous  are  modest  the  vicious immodest  the  righteous  are  blessed  the  unrighteous  are  miserable  Here I have opposed simple to simple and compound to compound were the words  immodest  and  unrighteous  to be pronounced without opposition the accent would fall upon the  second  syllable instead of the  first    In  explanatory emphases  the very same words are differently marked according to the writer's design as What did my master say If I lay the stress upon  what  it is a general interrogation if I place it upon  my  it implies that other masters were concerned if  master  is distinguished it notes that there were other persons and if the  emphasis  lies boldest upon  say  it shows I want to know his particular words  Both the cause and the effect in any sentence require an  emphasis  Example To  live  WELL is to  die  HAPPYonly to be GOOD is to be GREATGUILT is the source of SORROW  CLIMAX is that progressive force and exaltation of expression which more powerfully impresses each subject on the mind and is not only of indispensible use but also highly ornamental In the execution of this there is much nicety as the rise in most cases should be gradual always harmonious and upon many occasions very forcibleTo illustrate the matter I shall offer several examples of different degrees of  climax  First from Shakespeare's Brutus which should rise with a full smooth philosophic weight and dignity  If these  As I am sure they do bear fire enough  To kindle cowards and to steal with valour  The melting spirits of women then countrymen  What need we any spur but our own cause  To prick us to redress What other bond  Than secret Romans who have spoke the word  And will not falter Or what other oath  Than honesty to honesty engag'd  That this shall be or we will fall for it  The  climax  of  reasoning  in these lines is too obvious to be insisted on therefore I shall only observe that the glow of expression as I may call it should warm with the argument  The  Sublime  and  Beautiful  from  Moses' Last Song  "Give ear oh ye heavens and I will speak and hear oh earth the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass because I will publish the name of the Lord Ascribe ye greatness unto our God He is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment A God of truth and without iniquityjust and right is hefor the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desart land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him and kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him"  We have an example from Addison which calls for dignity softened and impassioned by the most pathetic feeling of manly grief a feeling which very few have imagination to conceive happily and as few powers to express properly  'Tis Rome demands our tears  The mistress of the world the seat of empire  The nurse of heroes the delight of gods  That humbled the proud tyrants of the earth  And set the nations freeRome is no more  Oh liberty Oh virtue O my country  * * * * * * *  * * * * * * *  Whate'er the Roman virtue had subdued  The sun's whole course the day and year are Caesar's  For him the selfdevoted Decii died  The Fabii fell and the great Scipios conquer'd  Even Pompey fought for Caesar Oh my friends  How is the work of Fate the toil of ages  The Roman empire fall'nOh curs'd ambition  Fallen into Caesar's handsOur great forefathers  Had left him nought to conquer but his country  Of  Pathetic Lamentation  from  Jeremiah  "How does the city sit solitary that was full of people how is she become as a widow she that was great among the nations and princess among the provinces How is she become tributary she weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks Among all her losses she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies for these things I weep mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me My children are desolate because the enemy prevailed My eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people"  Of  pathetic descriptive Melancholy  from  Shakespeare  of comfort no man speak  Let's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs  Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes  Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth  Let's chuse executors and talk of wills  And yet not so for what can we bequeath  Save our deposed bodies to the ground  Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke's  And nothing can we call our own but death  And that small model of the barren earth  Which serves as dust and cover to our bones  For heaven's sake let's sit upon the ground  And tell sad stories of the deaths of kings  How some have been deposed some slain in war  Some haunted by the ghosts they dispossessed  Some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd  All murther'dfor within the hollow crown  That rounds the mortal temples of a king  Keeps Death his courtthrow away respect  Tradition form and ceremonious duty  For you have but mistook me ail this while  I live on bread like you feel want like you  Taste grief need friends like you Subjected thus  How can you say to me I am a king  K Richard II  The following passage from  Otway  should gradually warm into  Rapture  Can there in woman be such glorious faith  Sure all ill stories of thy sex are false  Oh woman lovely woman Nature made thee  To temper man we had been brutes without you  Angels are painted fair to look like you  There's in you all that we believe of Heaven  Amazing brightness purity and truth  Eternal joy and everlasting love  An instance of  Climax  in  vindictive Rage  we have in the following lines of  Young  Yet ere I fall be it one part of vengeance  To make ev'n thee confess that I am just  Thou seest a prince whose father thou hast slain  Whose native country thou hast laid in blood  Whose sacred personOh thou hast profan'd  Whose reign extinguish'd What was left to me  So highly born No kingdom but revenge  No treasure but thy tortures and thy groans  Vindictive Ferocity  from  Milton  My sentence is for open warof wiles  More inexpert I boast notthem let those  Contrive who need unworthy of our might  For while they sit contriving shall the rest  Millions now under arms who longing wait  The signal to ascend sit lingering here  Heav'n's fugitives and for their dwellingplace  Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame  The prison of his tyranny who reigns  By our delayNo let us rather choose  Arm'd with hellflames and fury all at once  O'er heav'n's high towers to force resistless way  Turning our tortures into horrid arms  Against our torturerWhen to meet the noise  Of his terrific engine he shall hear  Infernal thunder and for light'ning see  Black fire and horror shot with equal rage  Amongst his angelsand his throne itself  Mixt with Tartarian sulphur and strange fire  His own invented tormentsbut perhaps  The way seems difficult and steep to scale  With adverse wing against a higher foe  Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench  Of that forgetful lake benumb not still  That with our proper motion we ascend  Up to our native seatdescent and fall  To us are adverseWho but felt of late  When our fierce foe hung on our broken rear  Insulting and pursued thro' the deep  With what compulsion and laborious flight  We sunk thus low The ascent is easy then  Th' event is fear'dShould we again provoke  Our enemy some worse way he may find  To our destruction if there be in hell  Fear to be worse destroy'dWhat can be worse  Than to dwell hereDriven out from bliss condemn'd  From this abhorred deep to utter woe  Where pain of unextinguishable fire  Must exercise us without hope of end  The vassals of his anger when the scourge  Inexorable and the tort'ring hour  Calls us to penance More destroyed than thus  We must be quite abolished and expire  What fear we then what doubt we to incense  His utmost ire which to the height enraged  Will either quite consume us and reduce  To nothing this essential happier far  Than miserable to have eternal being  Or if our substance be indeed divine  And cannot cease to be we are at worst  On this side nothing and by proof we feel  Our pow'r sufficient to disturb his heav'n  And with perpetual inroads to alarm  Tho' inaccessible his fatal throne  Which if not victory is yet revenge  A  Climax  of  jealous Rage Shakespeare  give us in the following lines  I had been happy if the general camp  Pioneers and all had tasted her sweet body  So I had nothing knownOh now for ever  Farewel the tranquil mind farewel content  Farewel the plumed troops and the big war  That make ambition virtue O farewel  Farewel the neighing steed and the shrill trump  The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife  The royal banner and all quality  Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war  And oh ye mortal engines whose rude throats  Th' immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit  Farewel Othello's occupation's gone  A  Climax  of more Rapidity proceeding from a sudden Burst of Grief  Shakespeare  gives as follows  Come shew me what thoul't do  Woo't weep woo't fast woo't fight woo't tear thyself  Woo't drink up Eisel eat a crocodile  I'll do'tDost thou come hither but to whine  To outface me with leaping in her grave  Be buried quick with her and so will I  And if thou prat'st of mountains let them heap  Millions of acres on us till our ground  Singeing its pate against the burning zone  Make Ossa like a wart  Any person who can do justice to these or similar passages either by genius or instruction may claim a sufficient knowledge of  climax  which however as well as  emphasis  is farther explained under the term MODULATION  If we consider the human voice through the whole extent of its several divisions we shall easily discover that nothing can require more the assistance of art to render it pleasing and expressive  The art of harmonious expression is distinguished by the term  modulation  for the better comprehending of which let us borrow a division from  music countertenor tenor  and  base  or  upper medium  and  lower  notes Every one of these so far as  reading  and  declamation  extend may be found or created more or less perfectly in every voice according to the organs of utterance and the proper use of those organs it then remains properly to appropriate each of the divisions  To all plaintive amorous passages humble insinuation flattery and frequently to exclamations of joy and distractions the  countertenor  is most properly applied as will appear from the following examples first from Otway in the  plaintive strain    Oh Belvidera doubly I'm a beggar  Undone by Fortune and in debt to thee  Want worldly want that hungry meagre fiend  Is at my heels and chaces me in view  Canst thou bear cold and hunger Can these limbs  Fram'd for the tender offices of love  Endure the bitter gripes of smarting poverty  When banish'd by our miseries abroad  As suddenly we shall be to seek out  In some far climate where our names are strangers  For charitable succourwilt thou then  When in a bed of straw we shrink together  And the bleak winds shall whistle round our heads  Wilt thou then talk thus to me Wilt thou then  Hush my cares thus and shelter me with love  Venice Preserv'd  Instance of the  amorous Style  from  Lee  No more of this no more for I disdain  All pomp when thou art by Far be the noise  Of kings and courts from us whose gentle souls  Our kinder stars have steer'd another way  Free as the forestbirds we'll pair together  Without rememb'ring who our fathers were  Fly to the arbours grots and flow'ry meads  And in soft murmurs interchange our souls  Together drink the chrystal of the stream  Or taste the yellow fruit which Autumn yields  And when the golden ev'ning calls us home  Wing to our downy nest and sleep till morn  Theodosius  Humility  and  Insinuation  are thus happily set forth by  Shakespeare  Thus Brutus did my master did me kneel  Thus did Marc Antony bid me fall down  And being prostrate thus he bade me say  Brutus is noble valiant wise and honest  Caesar was mighty royal bold and loving  Say I love Brutus and I honour him  Say I fear'd Caesar honour'd him and lov'd him  If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony  May safely come to him and be resolv'd  How Caesar hath deserv'd to lie in death  Marc Antony shall not love Caesar dead  So well as Brutus living but will follow  The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus  Thorough the hazards of this untrod state  With all true faith  Julius Caesar  Dissimulation  which requires the same tone of expression we find in these lines of  Young  It hurts not me my lord but as I love you  Warmly as you I wish Don Carlos well  But I am likewise Don Alonzo's friend  There all the difference lies between us two  In me my lord you hear another self  And give me leave to add a better too  Clear'd from those errors which tho' born of virtue  Are such as may hereafter give you pain  Revenge  Instances of  Exclamation  in  Joy  and  Rage  are thus set forth by  Shakespeare  Oh my soul's joy  If after every tempest come such calms  May the winds blow till they have waken'd death  And let the lab'ring bark climb hills of seas  Olympus high and duck again as low  As hell's from heav'n  Whip me ye devils  From the possession of this heav'nly sight  Blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur  Wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire  Othello  Of  Despair  from  Sophocles  "Alas alas the truth now appears too plainlyoh light this is the last time I shall behold theealas alas wretched man where am Iwhence comes it that my voice so suddenly fails meoh fortune whither art thou fled unhappy wretched man that I amI feel a raging anguish while I think of my misfortunesoh friends what can I now see or love or entertain or hear with comfortoh friends immediately forsake a wretch an execrable wretch abhorr'd of Gods and menCursed be the man that unloosed my fetters and saved me in the desart where I was exposedhe did me no real kindness I might then have died with less sorrow to myself and friends I should neither have become the sanguine murderer of my father nor the incestuous husband of my mother"  The preceding examples may suffice for the  upper tones  of voice which however should never be suffered to run into feigned squeaking or unnatural softness  The  middle notes  or  tenor  of expression suit all common narrations dissertations and those parts of declamation which do not touch upon the passions I presume it would be deemed superfluous to give various examples of what every book which presents itself for perusal calls for in general therefore I shall only transcribe one short passage from Milton for the  medium notes    Know that in the soul  Are many lesser faculties that serve  Reason as chief among these Fancy next  Her office holds of all external things  Which the five watchful senses represent  She forms imagination's airy shapes  Which reason joining or disjoining frames  All that we affirm or what deny and call  Our knowledge or opinion then retires  Into her private cell where nature rests  Oft in her absence mimic fancy wakes  To imitate her but misjoining shapes  Wild work produces oft and most in dreams  Ill matching words and deeds long past or late  Paradise Lost  That degree of expression I term  base  is particularly well applied to gloomy meditation passages of horror the invocation of fiends cynical roughness and vindictive rageInstance of  Gloomy Reflection  from  Young    Whether first nature or long want of peace  Has wrought my mind to this I cannot tell  But horrors now are not displeasing to me  I like this rocking of the battlements  Rage on ye winds burst clouds and waters roar  Ye bear a just resemblance of my fortune  And suit the gloomy habit of my soul  Revenge  An Example of  Horror  we have in these Lines of  Rowe  An universal horror  Struck thro' my eyes and chill'd my very heart  The cheerful day was every where shut out  With care and left a more than midnight darkness  Such as might ev'n be felt a few dim lamps  That feebly lifted up their sickly heads  Look'd faintly thro' the shade and made it seem  More dismal by such light while those who waited  In solemn sorrow mix'd with wild amazement  Observ'd a dreadful silence  Instance of  Horror  from  Shakespeare  Is this a dagger which I see before me  The handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee  I have thee notand yet I see thee still  Art thou not fatal vision sensible  To feeling as to sight or art thou but  A dagger of the minda false creation  Proceeding from the heat oppressed brain  I see thee yetin form as palpable  As that which now I draw  Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going  And such an instrument I was to use  Mine eyes are made the fools of th' other senses  Or else worth all the restI see thee still  And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood  Which was not so beforethere's no such thing  It is the bloody business which informs  Thus to mine eyesnow o'er one half the world  Nature seems deadand wicked dreams abuse  The curtain'd sleepnow witchcraft

Moves like a ghostthou sound and firm set earth  Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear  Thy very stones prate of my whereabout  And take the present horror from the time  Which now suits with it  Macbeth  Invocation of  Jealousy  from  Mallet  Thou jealousy  Almighty tyrant of the human mind  Who canst at will unsettle the calm brain  O'erturn the scaled heart and shake the man  Thro' all his frame with tempest and distraction  Rise to my present aid call up thy powers  Thy furious fears thy blast of dreadful passion  Thy whips snakes mortal stings thy host of horrors  Rouse thy whole war against him and complete  My purpos'd vengeance  Invocation of  Fiends  from  Young  Ye pow'rs of darkness who rejoice in ill  All sworn by Styx with pestilential blasts  To wither every virtue in the bud  To keep the door of dark conspiracy  And snuff the grateful fumes of human blood  From sulphur blue or your red beds of fire  On your black ebon thrones auspicious rise  And bursting thro' the barriers of this world  Stand in dread contrast to the golden sun  Fright daylight hence with your infernal smiles  And howl aloud your formidable joy  The following Passages of  Enraged Discontent  from  Rowe  claim the under Notes of Expression  Come lead me to my dungeon plunge me down  Deep from the hated sight of man and day  Where under covert of the friendly darkness  My soul may brood at leisure o'er her sorrows  * * * * * * * *  I tell thee slave I have shook hands with Hope  And all my thoughts are rage despair and horror  Tamerlane  These Lines of the same Author present us with  Cynical Roughness  and  Contempt  Yes thou hast thy sex's virtues  Their affectation pride illnature noise  Proneness to change even from the joy that pleas'd them  So gracious is

cause to say so yet  But thou shalt haveand creep time ne'er so slow  Yet it shall come for me to do thee good  I had a thing to saybut let it go  The sun is in the heav'ns and the proud day  Attended by the pleasures of the world  Is all too wanton and too full of gauds  To give me audienceif the midnight bell  Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth  Sound one unto the drowsy race of night  If this same were a churchyard where we stand  Or thou possessed with a thousand wrongs  Or if that surly spirit melancholy  Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy thick  Which else runs tickling up and down the veins  Making the ideot laughter keep mens eyes  And strain their cheeks with idle merriment  A passion hateful to my purposes  Or if thou could'st see me without eyes  Hear me without thine ears and make reply  Without a tongueusing conceit alone  Then in despite of broadey'd watchful day  I would into thy bosom pour my thoughtsc  King John  Having thus given examples for each of the three divisions of voice it becomes necessary to remark that the variations in each are many and that the appropriations I have made are only meant in general There are certainly several exceptions but these must be left to the instructor's or student's discernment as entering into every particular would be if not impracticable at least intolerably tedious  PAUSES next present themselves to consideration and chiefly occur in meditation doubt or confusion no exact time can be fixed for them but they ought to be made longer or shorter according to the importance of the subject and in most especially passages of reflection the voice should have a tone of continuance which constitutes the difference between a  pause  and  break  the former is a gradual stop the latter a sudden check of expression  Pauses  of the first sort occur in the following lines of Shakespeare and as the subject is of great weight should be of considerable duration perhaps while one could number six or a period and half to each  It must be by his death and for my part  I know no personal cause to spurn at him  But for the generalHe would be crown'd  How that might change his naturethere's the question  It is the bright day that brings forth the adder  And that craves wary walking crown himthat  And then I grant we put a sting in him  Which at his will he may do danger with  Julius Caesar  Or these Lines from the same Author  To beor not to bethat is the question  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  The slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles

sleep  To sleep perchance to dreamAy there's the rub  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil  Must give us pause  Hamlet  Pauses  of confusion are shorter than those of reflection and are to be fill'd up with hesitative panting breath while every succeeding word or sentence varies in tone of expression from the formerinstances from Shakespeare as follow  Nay good Lieutenantalas gentlemen  Help hoLieutenantSirMontano  Help Mastershere's a goodly watch indeed  Who's thatWho rings that bellDiabloHo  The town will rise  Othello  * * * * * * * *  Yes 'tis Emiliaby and byshe's dead  'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death  The noise was highHa no more moving  Still as the graveshall she come in were't good  I think she stirs againnoWhat's the best  Othello  Every discerning reader will readily perceive that the latter example is of a stronger but slower confusion than the former  BREAKS as I have before hinted are only  pauses  of a different nature more abrupt and sudden as when a passion cuts short before the meaning is fully explained these most frequently occur in violent grief and impetuous rage and the tone of voice alters as the passion rises or falls One general rule in the expression of grief is that when gradual the tones should swell pathetically but when sudden they should burst forth and break the voice still avoiding any dissonant scream  or croakIn these lines of Shakespeare we find pauses of grief swelling slowly and working upon themselves  I prithee Daughter do not make me mad  I will not trouble thee my Childfarewell  We'll meet no moreno more see one another  Let shame come when it will I do not call it  I do not bid the Thunderbearer strike  Nor tell tales of thee to avenging Heav'n

fiery Duketell the hot Duke that  Nobut not yet may be he is not well  King Lear  Having thus particularly and distinctly explained the proper application of the three grand divisions of the voice in order to bring what has been said into a narrow compass and to place it in one point of view I shall produce for an example the  Seven Ages of Shakespeare  and mark the lines according to the variations which agreeable to the foregoing observations ought to be made in speaking or in reading this passage The  countertenor  or upper notes I distinguish by  italics  the  tenor  or medium retain the  common type  and the  base  is marked by CAPITALS  All the world's a stage  And all the men and women merely players  They have their exits and their entrances  And each man in his time plays many parts  His acts being seven agesFirst the infant  Mewling and pewking in the nurse's arms  And then the whining schoolboy  with his satchel  And shining morning face creeping like snail  Unwillingly to school  and then the lover  Sighing like furnace with a woful ballad  Made to his mistress' eyebrow  then a soldier  Full of strange oaths and bearded like a pard  Jealous in honoursudden and quick in quarrel  Seeking the bubble reputation  Ev'n in the cannon's mouth and then the JUSTICE  IN FAIR ROUND BELLY WITH GOOD CAPON LIN'D  WITH EYES SEVERE AND BEARD OF FORMAL CUT  FULL OF WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES  And so he plays his part the sixth age shifts  Into the  lean and slipper'd pantaloon  With spectacles on nose and pouch on side  His youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide  For his shrunk shanks  and his big manly voice  Turning again towards childish treble  pipes  And whistles in the sound  Last scene of all  Which ends this strange eventful history  Is second childishness and mere oblivion  Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing  Every  emphasis  and variation of voice should be founded on reason it may be proper therefore to show why the several parts of the preceding lines are thus distinguished In the first age of infancy the upper notes are most descriptive of that tender time as they are also of the whimpering schoolboy and their softness likewise suits the sighing of the lover The forward confidence of the soldier demands a fullspirited medium and the corpulent importance generally imputed to magistracy is well pictured by the jolly swell of the  base  notes while the feebleness of fast declining age calls for the  countertenor  tremulated as it were with weakness  Thus much for general explanation which I have delivered in as full and clear a manner as the nature of my design would possibly admit and having set forth such examples as explained by  teachers  or carefully investigated by  students  may give a full idea of what is intended I shall proceed to some brief remarks upon  utterance  and  action  in which though it is not probable that many will excel yet most may be improved  First then if a voice is naturally harsh great care should be taken to avoid guttural expression nor should the tongue be allowed to play too much between the teeth the breath drawn as it were from the stomach and vibrated upon  within  the mouth will soften harsh notes and render them much more tuneable on the contrary a weak shrill voice should borrow solidity and force from the throat as too great an expansion of the lips is disgraceful to the features so unnatural contraction of them will render expression unmeaning and imperfect  Stops  and  cadences  are a most essential point of consideration and cannot be better set forth than in the following remarks of a French author  'It is necessary for us' says he 'to respire from time to time but the voice does not repose equally at the conclusion of every sense in a sentence of considerable length we respire at every  comma  but this short pause is made in such a manner as to show by the tone of continuance that we are to go farther the ear remaining unsatisfied because the pronunciation continues suspended till the sentence is completely finished as for example  At such a time the King having taken these matters into consideration determined  here Attention is inquisitive to know what follows the  colon  and  semicolon  are marks of more considerable respiration yet still leave Judgment in suspence till the period unfolds the whole and calls for a concluding cadence  'In every part or parts of a sentence there is elevation and depression of the voice which never absolutely reposes but at the conclusion of  a period all other respiration being of continuance'  There is undoubtedly much judgment in the composition of harmonious and comprehensive periods a dissonant unconnected style will take greatly from the beauty and force of expression as a discordant piece of music must disgrace a performance of the ablest master and injure the utterance of the most perfect instruments  Frequent use strengthens and meliorates the organs of expression and practice will teach a most essential point that of pitching the voice to any place or number of persons There is considerable nicety in knowing the different effect which the same notes of voice may have in places of equal dimensions but of different construction of a place containing but few auditors or thronged with a large number and this point of excellence must be attained by much practice and observation Only thus much may be observed in general of the operations of sound that where it undulates considerably the louder a  reader  or  declaimer  goes beyond the just pitch the more indistinct he will be of which we find very frequent instances in  cathedral  churches a full audience in any place will require at least twice the force of expression of a thin one which exclusive of some buzz that must unavoidably attend a numerous assembly may be philosophically accounted for by an essential density of air from the conjunct respiration of so many people  The voice being pitched and modulated thro' the several variations which may be found necessary it remains to consider to comprehend and to feel the subject without which expression must be languid unaffecting and wearisome What we  read  or  speak  unfelt must be like painting without light or shade there may be just symmetry of parts and good colouring but unless they are raised and brought forward both pall on the view and die upon the canvass  Spirit and feeling are necessary to idea as well as to sight for which reason  teachers  should not only make their  pupils  understand every word they  read  but their general sense in a state of connection a point of care seldom attended to  Emphatic expression feeling and taste are particularly essential to poetry as that in general appeals oftner to the passions than any other species of writing  Cadences  also are more critical in numbers than in prose in both they should be smooth gradual and die away almost insensibly yet so as to preserve and to impress the last syllable both upon the ear and mind without snapping short the breath or sound which is extremely grating to a judicious hearer  How often is verse of every kind miserably mangled A sort of unmeaning pedantic recitative tedious from a repetition of misplaced unharmonious tones is substituted for dignity thus we find many who make a tolerable shift with prose the moment they see any number of measured syllables throw aside nature reason nay even common sense to display their knowledge of versification and what they think its peculiar importanceWhat can be more absurd Genuine poetry needs no pompous affectation to dignify it for as by transposing the words you cannot reduce it to prose neither can you take from its harmony by plain natural expression  I know not any thing which has done our language and the reading of it more injury than the  gingle of rhime especially that which is thrown into heroic measure it being certain that the more correct an author in that way is the more he will lead to monotony Instance Mr Pope who has been so critically exact in accenting particular syllables that very few of his pieces can be read with any tolerable variation of voice for which reason I would have learners kept from rhime in heroic measure till they are well grounded in a just mode of utterance Indeed we are not to wonder that the  generality  chaunt verse in so lamentable a manner when some of those who have sketched rules for reading insist upon such a servile obedience to the author as not only to change the accented syllable but even to favour his bad rhime with false pronunciation for example to sound the last syllable of  liberty  as an exact  rhime  either to  flee  or  fly  To prescribe a stop or half pause at the end of a line whether the sense requires it or not is another rule that has been given equally erroneous and disgustful  In  reading  properly so called  action  has no concern but  declamation  is very defective without it yet except upon the  stage  and among many there miserably methodized we scarce find anyWhen I recommend  action  I would not be supposed to intend that a speaker should be in continual motion or that puppetlike he is to lift up first one hand and then another merely to lay them down againNoI would have motions few easy graceful and for my own part I know not how a declaimer can possibly feel and stand stockstill but admit the possibility of this I will venture to say there is but little probability that his audience will think him in earnest I know that some delicate persons are afraid of becoming  too  theatrical  but there is a very wide difference between the  action  of an  orator  and an  actor  unless when the latter judiciously represents the former but I shall no further urge the necessity of a point so obvious let us proceed to the thing itself  First then  action  should be entirely reserved for those passages which contain somewhat interesting or important as demonstration or the enforcing of a charge This should be attended with the right arm stretched forward to the full extent the fingers even and the palm of the hand downwards or sometimes the hand turned sideways the fore finger only pointing if the circumstance demonstrated or given in charge be very momentous the well known and admired action of St Paul preaching at Athens stretching forth both arms palms downwards has much force and propriety  Where  grief  is to be expressed the right hand laid slowly to the left breast the head and chest bending forward is a just indication of it To express  confidence  and  resolution  the same hand must move to the same place but with quickness and vigour recoiling as it were from the heart which thereby seems to meet it With this action the head should be thrown back and the chest forward The expression of  ardent affection  is to close both hands warmly at half arm's length the fingers intermingling and to bring them to the breast with spirit If  expansion  of  mind  or any thing similar is to be pointed out then both arms should be cast different ways in a parallel line and the chest thrown open Folding arms with a drooping of the head describe contemplation erection of the head speaks dignity or with suitable  features contempt There are some few other instances of action which may be graceful and serves for variation though not absolutely necessary but these must be left to the choice and discretion of the declaimer and to the unconstrained operation of judicious feeling only thus much it may be necessary to observe that the left hand should seldom or never be used by itself and that all action should move between the tip of the shoulder and the seat of the heart all above is what Shakespeare justly styles sawing the air all below both unmeaning and ungraceful Upon the whole every motion should be the natural attendant of what is spoken if an extreme cannot be avoided I would rather recommend  no  action than  too much  or than such as must offend judicious eyes  Attitudes  or positions of the body when happily struck off and well applied are not only picturesque but striking all description of them with a pen must be faint and confused wherefore we refer to the pencil of some able painter  To what has been already offer'd we shall subjoin some useful remarks from an ingenious Treatise on the Art of Speaking  "If nature unassisted could form the eminent speaker where were the use of art and culture which no one pretends to question art is but nature improved upon and refined and before improvement is applied genius is but a mass of ore in the mine without lustre and without value because unknown and unthought of the ancients used to procure masters for pronunciation from the theatres and had youth taught gesture and attitude by the Palaestritae who taught much the same among them as dancingmasters do among us  "It is well when a youth has no natural impediment or defect in his specch and I should by no means advise that he who has be brought up to any profession requiring elocution yet there are instances of natural defects surmounted and eminent speakers formed by indefatigable diligence in spite of them DEMOSTHENES when he began to study rhetoric could not pronounce the first letter of the name of that art and CICERO was longnecked and narrow chested but diligent labour in what we are earnest upon surmounts all difficulties that are not too deeply rooted in nature for want of proper application we are frequently disgusted by public speakers lisping stammering and speaking thro' the nose pronouncing the letter k with the throat instead of the tongue s like th and screaming above or croaking below all natural pitch of human voice  Some unexperienced attempters at oratory mumble as if they were conjuring up spirits others bawl as loud as street hawkers some so precipitate in expression that no ear can distinguish others drag words like the heavy pauses of a great clock striking some have got a disagreeable habit of shrugging up their shoulders others of seesawing their bodies backwards and forwards or from side to side some open their mouths frightfully others keep their teeth so close as if the jaws were set all which with many other bad disgraceful habits should either be got the better of in early life or the young persons put into some other path than that of public speaking neglect of this occasions such confirmation of deficiency that not one speaker in twenty knows what to do with his hands voice or eyes  "Some actors who should most particularly apply to feeling and attention who should most strictly regard decorum are guilty of monstrous improprieties as to management of the eyes in particular to look full at the audience when speaking a soliloquy or a speech aside is intolerable a performer should not in theatrical station seem conscious of an audience or that there is a spectator looking on and one peculiar fault in performers is that they don't in general keep a fixed eye on those they speak to even in impassioned dialogue from whatever cause we may derive this disgraceful enfeebling inattention it is severely censurable"  It being far beyond the limits of our design to enter upon the general minutiae of our subject we refer our readers for a circumstantial description of the effects which various affections and passions have upon the human features to the studious treatise we have just now quoted from published by LONGMAN and BUCKLAND Paternosterrow though we think great part of it more curious than useful for where the mind by nature or representation properly feels the features will operate consonantly if words and looks are contrary no sympathy can be gained in which case the main point is lost
