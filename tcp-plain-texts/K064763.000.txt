 THREE DIALOGUES BETWEEN  Hylas  and  Philonous  The Design of which Is plainly to demonstrate the Reality and Perfection of Humane Knowlege the Incorporeal Nature of the Soul and the Immediate Providence of a DEITY In Opposition to  SCEPTICS  and  ATHEISTS  ALSO To open a METHOD for rendering the SCIENCES more easy useful and compendious  By  George Berkeley  M A Fellow of  Trinity  College  Dublin  LONDON  Printed by G  James  for HENRY CLEMENTS at the  HalfMoon  in S  Paul  's Churchyard MDCCXIII  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Lord  Berkeley  of  Stratton Master of the Rolls in the Kingdom of  Ireland  Chancellor of the Dutchy of  Lancaster  and one of the Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable PrivyCouncil  MY LORD  _THE Vertue Learning and good Sense which are acknowledged to distinguish Your Character wou'd tempt me to indulge myself the Pleasure Men naturally take in giving Applause to those whom they esteem and honour And it shou'd seem of Importance to the Subjects of  Great Britain  that they knew The eminent Share You enjoy in the Favour of Your Sovereign  and the Honours She has conferred upon You have not been owing to any Application from Your Lordship but entirely to Her Majesty's own Thought arising from a Sense of Your Personal Merit and an Inclination to reward it But as Your Name is prefixed to this Treatise with an Intention to do Honour to myself alone I shall only say that I am encouraged by the Favour You have treated me with to address these Papers to Your Lordship And I was the more ambitious of doing this because a Philosophical Treatise cou'd not so properly be addressed to any one as to a Person of Your Lordship's Character who to Your other valuable Distinctions have added the Knowlege and Relish of Philosophy I am with the greatest Respect  MY LORD  Your Lordship's most Obedient and Most Humble Servant GEORGE BERKELEY  THE PREFACE  _THO it seems the general Opinion of the World no less than the Design of Nature and Providence that the End of Speculation be Practice or the Improvement and Regulation of our Lives and Actions Yet those who are most addicted to speculative Studies seem as generally of another Mind And indeed if we consider the Pains that have been taken to perplex the plainest Things that Distrust of the Senses those Doubts and Scruples those Abstractions and Refinements that occurr in the very Entrance of the Sciences it will not seem strange that Men of Leisure and Curiosity  shou'd lay themselves out in fruitless Disquisitions without descending to the practical Parts of Life or informing themselves in the more necessary and important Parts of Knowlege  Upon the common Principles of Philosophers we are not assured of the Existence of Things from their being perceived And we are taught to distinguish their real Nature from that which falls under our Senses Hence arise  Scepticism  and  Paradoxes  It is not enough that we see and feel that we taste and smell a thing Its true Nature its absolute external Entity is still concealed For tho it be the Fiction of our own Brain we have made it inaccessible to all our Faculties Sense is fallacious Reason defective We spend our Lives in doubting of those things which other Men evidently know and believing those things which they laugh at and despise  In order therefore to divert the busy Mind of Man from vain Researches it seemed necessary to inquire into the Source of its Perplexities and if possible to lay down such Principles as by an easy Solution of them together with their own native Evidence may at once recommend themselves for Genuine to the Mind and rescue it from those endless Pursuits it is engaged in Which with a plain Demonstration  of the immediate Providence of an Allseeing GOD and the natural Immortality of the Soul shou'd seem the readiest Preparation as well as the strongest Motive to the Study and Practice of Vertue  This Design I proposed in the First Part of a Treatise concerning the  Principles of Humane Knowledge  published in the Year    But before I proceed to publish the Second Part I thought it requisite to treat more clearly and fully of certain Principles laid down in the First and to place them in a new Light Which is the Business of the following  Dialogues  In this Treatise which does not presuppose in the Reader any Knowledge of what was contained in the former it has been my Aim to introduce the Notions I advance into the Mind in the most easy and familiar manner especially because they carry with them a great Opposition to the Prejudices of Philosophers which have so far prevailed against the common Sense and natural Notions of Mankind  If the Principles which I here endeavour to propagate are admitted for true the Consequences which I think evidently flow from thence are that  Atheism  and  Scepticism  will be utterly destroyed many intricate Points made plain great Difficulties solved several useless  Parts of Science retrenched Speculation referred to Practice and Men reduced from Paradoxes to common Sense  And altho it may perhaps seem an uneasy Reflexion to some that when they have taken a Circuit thorow so many refined and unvulgar Notions they shou'd at last come to think like other Men Yet methinks this Return to the simple Dictates of Nature after having wandered thorow the wild Mazes of Philosophy is not unpleasant It is like coming home from a long Voyage A Man reflects with Pleasure on the many Difficulties and Perplexities he has passed thorow sets his Heart at ease and enjoys himself with more Satisfaction for the future  As it was my Intention to convince  Sceptics  and  Infidels  by Reason so it has been my Endeavor strictly to observe the most rigid Laws of Reasoning And to an impartial Reader I hope it will be manifest that the sublime Notion of a GOD and the comfortable Expectation of Immortality do naturally arise from a close and methodical Application of Thought Whatever may be the Result of that loose rambling Way not altogether improperly termed  Freethinking  by certain Libertines in Thought who can no more endure the Restraints of  Logic  than those of  Religion  or  Government  It will perhaps be objected to my Design that so far as it tends to ease the Mind of difficult and useless Inquiries it can affect only a few speculative Persons but if by their Speculations rightly placed the Study of Morality and the Law of Nature were brought more into Fashion among Men of Parts and Genius the Discouragements that draw to  Scepticism  removed the Measures of Right and Wrong accurately defined and the Principles of Natural Religion reduced into regular Systems as artfully disposed and clearly connected as those of some other Sciences There are grounds to think these Effects wou'd not only have a gradual Influence in repairing the too much defaced Sense of Vertue in the World but also by shewing that such Parts of Revelation as lie within the reach of Humane Inquiry are most agreeable to Right Reason wou'd dispose all prudent unprejudiced Persons to a modest and wary Treatment of those Sacred Mysteries which are above the Comprehension of our Faculties  It remains that I desire the Reader to withhold his Censure of these Dialogues till he has read them thorow Otherwise he may lay them aside in a Mistake of their Design or on account of Difficulties or Objections which he wou'd find answered in the Sequel A Treatise of this Nature  wou'd require to be once read over coherently in order to comprehend its Design the Proofs Solution of Difficulties and the Connexion and Disposition of its Parts If it be thought to deserve a Second Reading this I imagine will make the intire Scheme very plain Especially if Recourse be had to an Essay I wrote some Years since upon  Vision  and the Treatise concerning the  Principles of Humane Knowlege  Wherein divers Notions advanced in these  Dialogues  are farther pursued or placed in different Lights and other Points handled which naturally tend to confirm and illustrate them  The First DIALOGUE  Philonous  _GOOD Morrow  Hylas  I did not expect to find you abroad so early  Hylas  It is indeed something unusual but my Thoughts were so taken up with a Subject I was discoursing of last Night that finding I could not sleep I resolved to rise and take a turn in the Garden  Phil  It happened well to let you see what innocent and agreeable Pleasures you lose every Morning Can there be a pleasanter time of the Day or a more delightful Season of the Year That purple Sky these wild but sweet Notes of Birds the fragrant Bloom upon the Trees and Flowers the gentle Influence of the rising Sun these  and a thousand nameless Beauties of Nature inspire the Soul with secret Transports its Faculties too being at this time fresh and lively are fit for those Meditations which the Solitude of a Garden and Tranquillity of the Morning naturally dispose us to But I am afraid I interrupt your Thoughts for you seemed very intent on something  Hyl  It is true I was and shall be obliged to you if you will permit me to go on in the same Vein not that I would by any means deprive myself of your Company for my Thoughts always flow more easily in Conversation with a Friend than when I am alone But my Request is that you would suffer me to impart my Reflexions to you  Phil  With all my Heart it is what I should have requested my self if you had not prevented me  Hyl  I was considering the odd Fate of those Men who have in all Ages through an Affectation of being distinguished from the Vulgar or some unaccountable Turn of Thought pretended either to believe nothing at all or to believe the most extravagant Things in the World This however might be born if their Paradoxes and Scepticism did not draw after them some Consequences of general Disadvantage to Mankind But the Mischief lies here that when Men of less Leisure see them who are supposed  to have spent their whole time in the Pursuits of Knowlege professing an intire Ignorance of all Things or advancing such Notions as are repugnant to plain and commonly received Principles they will be tempted to entertain Suspicions concerning the most important Truths which they had hitherto held sacred and unquestionable  Phil  I intirely agree with you as to the ill Tendency of the affected Doubts of some Philosophers and fantastical Conceits of others I am even so far gone of late in this way of Thinking that I have quitted several of the sublime Notions I had got in their Schools for vulgar Opinions And I give it you on my Word since this Revolt from Metaphysical Notions to the plain Dictates of Nature and common Sense I find my Understanding strangely enlightened so that I can now easily comprehend a great many Things which before were all Mystery and Riddle  Hyl  I am glad to find there was nothing in the Accounts I heard of you  Phil  Pray what were those  Hyl  You were represented in last Night's Conversation as one who maintained the most extravagant Opinion that ever entered into the Mind of Man  viz  That there is no such Thing as  material Substance  in the World  Phil  That there is no such Thing as what Philosophers call  Material Substance  I am seriously persuaded But if I were made to see any thing Absurd or Sceptical in this I should then have the same Reason to renounce this that I imagine I have now to reject the contrary Opinion  Hyl  What can any Thing be more fantastical more repugnant to common Sense or a more manifest Piece of Scepticism than to believe there is no such Thing as  Matter  Phil  Softly good  Hylas  What if it should prove that you who hold there is are by Vertue of that Opinion a greater  Sceptic  and maintain more Paradoxes and Repugnancies to common Sense than I who believe no such Thing  Hyl  You may as soon persuade me The Part is greater than the Whole as that in order to avoid Absurdity and Scepticism I should ever be obliged to give up my Opinion in this Point  Phil  Well then are you content to admit that Opinion for true which upon Examination shall appear most agreeable to common Sense and remote from Scepticism  Hyl  With all my Heart Since you are for raising Disputes about the plainest Things in Nature I am content for once to hear what you have to say  Phil  Pray  Hylas  what do you mean by a  Sceptic  Hyl  I mean what all Men mean one that doubts of every Thing  Phil  He then who entertains no Doubt concerning some particular Point with regard to that Point cannot be thought a  Sceptic  Hyl  I agree with you  Phil  Whether does Doubting consist in embracing the Affirmative or Negative Side of a Question  Hyl  In neither for whoever understands  English  cannot but know that  Doubting  signifies a Suspense between both  Phil  He then that denies any Point can no more be said to doubt of it than he who affirms it with the same Degree of Assurance  Hyl  True  Phil  And consequently for such his Denial is no more to be esteemed a  Sceptic  than the other  Hyl  I acknowlege it  Phil  How comes it then  Hylas  that you pronounce me a  Sceptic  because I deny what you affirm  viz  the Existence of Matter Since for ought you can tell I am as peremptory in my Denial as you in your Affirmation  Hyl  Hold  Philonous  I have been a little out in my Definition but every false Step a Man makes in Discourse is not to be insisted on I said indeed that a  Sceptic  was one who doubted of every Thing but I should have added or who denies the Reality and Truth of Things  Phil  What Things Do you mean the Principles and Theoremes of Sciences But these you know are universal intellectual Notions and consequently independent of Matter the Denial therefore of this doth not imply the denying them  Hyl  I grant it But are there no other Things What think you of distrusting the Senses of denying the real Existence of sensible Things or pretending to know nothing of them Is not this sufficient to denominate a Man a  Sceptic  Phil  Shall we therefore examine which of us it is that denies the Reality of Sensible Things or professes the greatest Ignorance of them since if I take you rightly he is to be esteemed the greatest  Sceptic  Hyl  That is what I desire  Phil  What mean you by Sensible Things  Hyl  Those Things which are perceived by the Senses Can you imagine that I mean any thing else  Phil  Pardon me  Hylas  if I am desirous clearly to apprehend your Notions since this  may much shorten our Inquiry Suffer me then to ask you this farther Question Are those Things only perceived by the Senses which are perceived immediately Or may those Things properly be said to be  Sensible  which are perceived mediately or not without the Intervention of others  Hyl  I do not sufficiently understand you  Phil  In reading a Book what I immediately perceive are the Letters but mediately or by means of these are suggested to my Thoughts the Notions of God Virtue Truth  c  Now that the Letters are truly Sensible Things or perceived by Sense there is no doubt But I would know whether you take the Things suggested by them to be so too  Hyl  No certainly it were absurd to think  God  or  Virtue  Sensible Things tho' they may be signified and suggested to the Mind by Sensible Marks with which they have an arbitrary Connexion  Phil  It seems then that by  Sensible Things  you mean those only which can be perceived immediately by Sense  Hyl  Right  Phil  Does it not follow from this that tho' I see one part of the Sky Red and another Blue and that my Reason doth thence evidently conclude there must be some Cause of that Diversity of Colours yet that Cause  cannot be said to be a Sensible Thing or perceived by the Sense of Seeing  Hyl  It does  Phil  In like manner tho' I hear Variety of Sounds yet I cannot be said to hear the Causes of those Sounds  Hyl  You cannot  Phil  And when by my Touch I perceive a thing to be hot and heavy I cannot say with any Truth or Propriety that I feel the Cause of its Heat or Weight  Hyl  To prevent any more Questions of this kind I tell you once for all that by  Sensible Things  I mean those only which are perceived by Sense and that in truth the Senses perceive nothing which they do not perceive immediately for they make no Inferences The Deducing therefore of Causes or Occasions from Effects and Appearances which alone are perceived by Sense intirely relates to Reason  Phil  This Point then is agreed between us That  sensible things are those only which are immediately perceived by Sense  You will farther inform me whether we immediately perceive by Sight any thing beside Light and Colours and Figures or by Hearing any thing but Sounds by the Palate any thing beside Tastes by the Smell beside Odors or by the Touch more than tangible Qualities  Hyl  We do not  Phil  It seems therefore that if you take away all sensible Qualities there remains nothing sensible  Hyl  I grant it  Phil  Sensible things therefore are nothing else but so many sensible Qualities or Combinations of sensible Qualities  Hyl  Nothing else  Phil  Heat then is a sensible thing  Hyl  Certainly  Phil  Does the Reality of sensible things consist in being perceived or is it something distinct from their being perceived and that bears no relation to the Mind  Hyl  To  exist  is one thing and to be  perceived  is another  Phil  I speak with regard to sensible things only And of these I ask Whether by their real Existence you mean a Subsistence exterior to the Mind and distinct from their being perceived  Hyl  I mean a real absolute Being distinct from and without any relation to their being perceived  Phil  Heat therefore if it be allowed a real Being must exist without the Mind  Hyl  It must  Phil  Tell me  Hylas  is this real Existence equally compatible to all Degrees of Heat which we perceive or is there any Reason  why we should attribute it to some and deny it others And if there be pray let me know that Reason  Hyl  Whatever Degree of Heat we perceive by Sense we may be sure the same exists in the Object that occasions it  Phil  What the greatest as well as the least  Hyl  I tell you the Reason is plainly the same in respect of both They are both perceived by Sense nay the greater Degree of Heat is more sensibly perceived and consequently if there is any Difference we are more certain of its real Existence than we can be of the Reality of a lesser Degree  Phil  But is not the most vehement and intense Degree of Heat a very great Pain  Hyl  No one can deny it  Phil  And is any unperceiving thing capable of Pain or Pleasure  Hyl  No certainly  Phil  Is your material Substance a sensless Being or a Being endowed with Sense and Perception  Hyl  It is sensless without doubt  Phil  It cannot therefore be the Subject of Pain  Hyl  By no means  Phil  Nor consequently of the greatest Heat perceived by Sense since you acknowlege this to be no small Pain  Hyl  I grant it  Phil  What shall we say then of your external Object is it a material Substance or no  Hyl  It is a material Substance with the sensible Qualities inhering in it  Phil  How then can a great Heat exist in it since you own it cannot in a material Substance I desire you wou'd clear this Point  Hyl  Hold  Philonous  I fear I was out in yielding intense Heat to be a Pain It shou'd seem rather that Pain is something distinct from Heat and the Consequence or Effect of it  Phil  Upon putting your Hand near the Fire do you perceive one simple uniform Sensation or two distinct Sensations  Hyl  But one simple Sensation  Phil  Is not the Heat immediately perceived  Hyl  It is  Phil  And the Pain  Hyl  True  Phil  Seeing therefore they are both immediately perceived at the same time and the Fire affects you only with one simple or uncompounded Idea it follows that this same simple Idea is both the intense Heat immediately perceived and the Pain and consequently that the intense Heat immediately  perceived is nothing distinct from a particular sort of Pain  Hyl  It seems so  Phil  Again try in your Thoughts  Hylas  if you can conceive a vehement Sensation to be without Pain or Pleasure  Hyl  I cannot  Phil  Or can you frame to yourself an Idea of sensible Pain or Pleasure in general abstracted from every particular Idea of Heat Cold Tastes Smells  c  Hyl  I do not find that I can  Phil  Does it not therefore follow that sensible Pain is nothing distinct from those Sensations or Ideas in an intense Degree  Hyl  It is undeniable and to speak the Truth I begin to suspect a very great Heat cannot exist but in a Mind perceiving it  Phil  What are you then in that  Sceptical  State of Suspense between Affirming and Denying  Hyl  I think I may be positive in the Point A very violent and painful Heat cannot exist without the Mind  Phil  It has not therefore according to you any real Being  Hyl  I own it  Phil  Is it therefore certain that there is no body in Nature really hot  Hyl  I have not denied there is any real Heat in Bodies I only say there is no such thing as an intense real Heat  Phil  But did you not say before that all Degrees of Heat were equally real or if there was any difference that the Greater were more undoubtedly real than the Lesser  Hyl  True But it was because I did not then consider the Ground there is for distinguishing between them which I now plainly see And it is this Because intense Heat is nothing else but a particular kind of painful Sensation and Pain cannot exist but in a perceiving Being it follows that no intense Heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal Substance But this is no Reason why we should deny Heat in an inferior Degree to exist in such a Substance  Phil  But how shall we be able to discern those Degrees of Heat which exist only in the Mind from those which exist without it  Hyl  That is no difficult matter You know the least Pain cannot exist unperceived whatever therefore Degree of Heat is a Pain exists only in the Mind But as for all other Degrees of Heat nothing obliges us to think the same of them  Phil  I think you granted before that no unperceiving Being was capable of Pleasure any more than of Pain  Hyl  I did  Phil  And is not Warmth or a more gentle Degree of Heat than what causes Uneasiness a Pleasure  Hyl  What then  Phil  Consequently it cannot exist without the Mind in any unperceiving Substance or Body  Hyl  So it seems  Phil  Since therefore as well those Degrees of Heat that are not painful as those that are can exist only in a Thinking Substance may we not conclude that external Bodies are absolutely incapable of any Degree of Heat whatsoever  Hyl  On second Thoughts I do not think it so evident that Warmth is a Pleasure as that a great Degree of Heat is a Pain  Phil  I do not pretend that Warmth is as great a Pleasure as Heat is a Pain But if you grant it to be even a small Pleasure it serves to make good my Conclusion  Hyl  I cou'd rather call it an  Indolence  It seems to be nothing more than a Privation of both Pain and Pleasure And that such a Quality or State as this may agree to an unthinking Substance I hope you will not deny  Phil  If you are resolved to maintain that Warmth or a gentle Degree of Heat is no Pleasure I know not how to convince you otherwise than by appealing to your own Sense But what think you of Cold  Hyl  The same that I do of Heat An intense Degree of Cold is a Pain for to feel  a very great Cold is to perceive a great Uneasiness It cannot therefore exist without the Mind but a lesser Degree of Cold may as well as a lesser Degree of Heat  Phil  Those Bodies therefore upon whose Application to our own we perceive a moderate Degreee of Heat must be concluded to have a moderate Degree of Heat or Warmth in them And those upon whose Application we feel a like Degree of Cold must be thought to have Cold in them  Hyl  They must  Phil  Can any Doctrine be true that necessarily leads a Man into an Absurdity  Hyl  Without doubt it cannot  Phil  Is it not an Absurdity to think that the same thing shou'd be at the same time both cold and warm  Hyl  It is  Phil  Suppose now one of your Hands hot and the other cold and that they are both at once put into the same Vessel of Water in an intermediate State will not the Water seem cold to one Hand and warm to the other  Hyl  It will  Phil  Ought we not therefore by your Principles to conclude it is really both cold and warm at the same time that is according to your own Concession to believe an Absurdity  Hyl  I confess it seems so  Phil  Consequently the Principles themselves are false since you have granted that no true Principle leads to an Absurdity  Hyl  But after all can any thing be more absurd than to say  there is no Heat in the Fire  Phil  To make the Point still clearer tell me whether in two Cases exactly alike we ought not to make the same Judgment  Hyl  We ought  Phil  When a Pin pricks your Finger does it not rend and divide the Fibres of your Flesh  Hyl  It does  Phil  And when a Coal burns your Finger does it any more  Hyl  It does not  Phil  Since therefore you neither judge the Sensation itself occasioned by the Pin nor any thing like it to be in the Pin you shoul'd not conformably to what you have now granted judge the Sensation occasioned by the Fire or any thing like it to be in the Fire  Hyl  Well since it must be so I am content to yield this Point and acknowlege that Heat and Cold are only Sensations existing in our Minds But there still remain Qualities enough to secure the Reality of external Things  Phil  But what will you say  Hylas  if it shall appear that the Case is the same with regard to all other sensible Qualities and that they can no more be supposed to exist without the Mind than Heat and Cold  Hyl  Then indeed you will have done something to the purpose but that is what I despair of seeing proved  Phil  Let us examine them in Order What think you of Tastes do they exist without the Mind or no  Hyl  Can any Man in his Senses doubt whether Sugar is sweet or Wormwood bitter  Phil  Inform me  Hylas  Is a sweet Taste a particular kind of Pleasure or pleasant Sensation or is it not  Hyl  It is  Phil  And is not Bitterness some kind of Uneasiness or Pain  Hyl  I grant it  Phil  If therefore Sugar and Wormwood are unthinking corporeal Substances existing without the Mind how can Sweetness and Bitterness that is Pleasure and Pain agree to them  Hyl  Hold  Philonous  I now see what it was deluded me all this time You asked whether Heat and Cold Sweetness and Bitterness were not particular Sorts of Pleasure and Pain to which I answered simply  that they were Whereas I should have thus distinguished Those Qualities as perceived by us are Pleasures or Pains but not as existing in the external Objects We must not therefore conclude absolutely that there is no Heat in the Fire or Sweetness in the Sugar but only that Heat or Sweetness as perceived by us are not in the Fire or Sugar What say you to this  Phil  I say it is nothing to the Purpose Our Discourse proceeded altogether concerning Sensible Things which you defined to be the Things we  immediately perceive by our Senses  Whatever other Qualities therefore you speak of as distinct from these I know nothing of them neither do they at all belong to the Point in Dispute You may indeed pretend to have discovered certain Qualities which you do not perceive and assert those insensible Qualities exist in Fire and Sugar But what Use can be made of this to your present Purpose I am at a Loss to conceive Tell me then once more do you acknowlege that Heat and Cold Sweetness and Bitterness meaning those Qualities which are perceived by the Senses do not exist without the Mind  Hyl  I see it is to no purpose to hold out so I give up the Cause as to those mentioned Qualities Though I profess it sounds odly to say that Sugar is not sweet  Phil  But for your farther Satisfaction take this along with you That which at other times seems sweet shall to a distempered Palate appear bitter And nothing can be plainer than that divers Persons perceive different Tastes in the same Food since that which one Man delights in another abhors And how could this be if the Taste was something really inherent in the Food  Hyl  I acknowlege I know not how  Phil  In the next place Odors are to be considered And with regard to these I would fain know whether what has been said of Tastes does not exactly agree to them Are they not so many pleasing or displeasing Sensations  Hyl  They are  Phil  Can you then conceive it possible that they should exist in an unperceiving Thing  Hyl  I cannot  Phil  Or can you imagine that Filth and Ordure affect those brute Animals that feed on them out of Choice with the same Smells which we perceive in them  Hyl  By no means  Phil  May we not therefore conclude of Smells as of the other forementioned Qualities that they cannot exist in any but a perceiving Substance or Mind  Hyl  I think so  Phil  Then as to Sounds what must we think of them Are they Accidents really inherent in external Bodies or not  Hyl  That they inhere not in the sonorous Bodies is plain from hence because a Bell struck in the exhausted Receiver of an AirPump sends forth no Sound The Air therefore must be thought the Subject of Sound  Phil  What Reason is there for that  Hylas  Hyl  Because when any Motion is raised in the Air we perceive a Sound greater or lesser in Proportion to the Air's Motion but without some Motion in the Air we never hear any Sound at all  Phil  And granting that we never hear a Sound but when some Motion is produced in the Air yet I do not see how you can infer from thence that the Sound itself is in the Air  Hyl  It is this very Motion in the external Air that produces in the Mind the Sensation of  Sound  For striking on the Drum of the Air it causes a Vibration which by the Auditory Nerves being communicated to the Brain the Soul is thereupon affected with the Sensation called  Sound  Phil  What is Sound then a Sensation  Hyl  I tell you as perceived by us it is a particular Sensation in the Mind  Phil  And can any Sensation exist without the Mind  Hyl  No certainly  Phil  How then can Sound being a Sensation exist in the Air if by the  Air  you mean a sensless Substance existing without the Mind  Hyl  You must distinguish  Philonous  between Sound as it is perceived by us and as it is in itself or which is the same thing between the Sound we immediately perceive and that which exists without us The former indeed is a particular kind of Sensation but the latter is merely a Vibrative or Undulatory Motion in the Air  Phil  I thought I had already obviated that Distinction by the Answer I gave when you were applying it in a like Case before But to say no more of that Are you sure then that Sound is really nothing but Motion  Hyl  I am  Phil  Whatever therefore agrees to real Sound may with Truth be attributed to Motion  Hyl  It may  Phil  It is then good Sense to speak of  Motion  as of a thing that is  loud sweet acute grave  c  Hyl  I see you are resolved not to understand me Is it not evident those Accidents or Modes belong only to sensible Sound or  Sound  in the Common Acceptation of the Word but not to  Sound  in the Real and Philosophic Sense which as I just now told you is nothing but a certain Motion of the Air  Phil  It seems then there are two Sorts of Sound the one Vulgar or that which is heard the other Philosophical and Real  Hyl  Even so  Phil  And the latter consists in Motion  Hyl  I told you so before  Phil  Tell me  Hylas  to which of the Senses think you the Idea of Motion belong To the Hearing  Hyl  No certainly but to the Sight and Touch  Phil  It should follow then that according to you real Sounds may possibly be  seen  or  felt  but never  heard  Hyl  Look you  Philonous  you may if you please make a Jest of my Opinion but that will not alter the Truth of Things I own indeed the Inferences you draw me into sound something odly but common Language you know is framed by and for the Use of the Vulgar we must not therefore wonder if Expressions adapted to exact Philosophic Notions seem uncouth and out of the way  Phil  Is it come to that I assure you I imagine myself to have gained no small  Point since you make so light of departing from common Phrases and Opinions it being a main Part of our Inquiry to examine whose Notions are widest of the common Road and most repugnant to the general Sense of the World But can you think it no more than a Philosophical Paradox to say that  real Sounds are never heard  and that the Idea of them is obtained by some other Sense And is there nothing in this contrary to Nature and the Truth of Things  Hyl  To deal ingenuously I do not like it And after the Concessions already made I had as good grant that Sounds too have no real Being without the Mind  Phil  And I hope you will make no Difficulty to acknowlege the same of Colours  Hyl  Pardon me the Case of Colours is very different Can any thing be plainer than that we see them on the Objects  Phil  The Objects you speak of are I suppose corporeal Substances existing without the Mind  Hyl  They are  Phil  And have true and real Colours inhering in them  Hyl  Each visible Object has that Colour which we see in it  Phil  How Is there any thing visible but what we perceive by Sight  Phil  There is not  Hyl  And do we perceive any thing by Sense which we do not perceive immediately  Hyl  How often must I be obliged to repeat the same thing I tell you we do not  Phil  Have Patience good  Hylas  and tell me once more whether there is any thing immediately perceived by the Senses except sensible Qualities I know you asserted there was not But I wou'd now be informed whether you still persist in the same Opinion  Hyl  I do  Phil  Pray is your corporeal Substance either a sensible Quality or made up of sensible Qualities  Hyl  What a Question that is who ever thought it was  Phil  My Reason for asking was because in saying  each visible Object has that Colour which we see in it  you make visible Objects to be corporeal Substances which implies either that corporeal Substances are sensible Qualities or else that there is something beside sensible Qualities perceived by Sight But as this Point was formerly agreed between us and is still maintained by you it is a clear Consequence that your corporeal Substance is nothing distinct from sensible Qualities  Hyl  You may draw as many absurd Consequences as you please and endeavor to perplex the plainest things but you shall never persuade me out of my Senses I clearly understand my own Meaning  Phil  I wish you would make me understand it too But since you are unwilling to have your Notion of corporeal Substance examined I shall urge that Point no farther Only be pleased to let me know whether the same Colours which we see exist in external Bodies or some other  Hyl  The very same  Phil  What are then the beautiful Red and Purple we see on yonder Clouds really in them Or do you imagine they have in themselves any other Form than that of a dark Mist or Vapour  Hyl  I must own  Philonous  those Colours are not really in the Clouds as they seem to be at this Distance They are only apparent Colours  Phil  Apparent  call you them how shall we distinguish these apparent Colours from real  Hyl  Very easily Those are to be thought apparent which appearing only at a distance vanish upon a nearer Approach  Phil  And those I suppose are to be thought real which are discovered by the most near and exact Survey  Hyl  Right  Phil  Is the nearest and exactest Survey made by help of a Microscope or by the naked Eye  Hyl  By a Microscope doubtless  Phil  But a Microscope often discovers Colours in an Object different from those perceived by the unassisted Sight And in case we had Microscopes magnifying to any assigned Degree it is certain that no Object whatsoever viewed thro' them wou'd appear in the same Colour which it exhibits to the naked Eye  Hyl  And what will you conclude from all this You cannot argue that there are really and naturally no Colours on Objects because by artificial Managements they may be altered or made to vanish  Phil  I think it may evidently be concluded from your own Concessions that all the Colours we see with our naked Eyes are only apparent as those on the Clouds since they vanish upon a more close and accurate Inspection which is afforded us by a Microscope Then as to what you say by way of Prevention I ask you whether the real and natural State of an Object is better discovered by a very sharp and piercing Sight or by one which is less sharp  Hyl  By the former without doubt  Phil  Is it not plain from  Dioptrics  that Microscopes make the Sight more penetrating  and represent Objects as they wou'd appear to the Eye in case it were naturally endowed with a most exquisite Sharpness  Hyl  It is  Phil  Consequently the Microscopical Representation is to be thought that which best sets forth the real Nature of the Thing or what it is in itself The Colours therefore by it perceived are more genuine and real than those perceived otherwise  Hyl  I confess there is something in what you say  Phil  Besides it is not only possible but manifest that there actually are Animals whose Eyes are by Nature framed to perceive those things which by reason of their Minuteness escape our Sight What think you of those inconceivably small Animals perceived by Glasses Must we suppose they are all stark blind or in case they see can it be imagined their Sight has not the same Use in preserving their Bodies from Injuries which appears in That of all other Animals and if it hath is it not evident they must see Particles less than their own Bodies which will present them with a far different View in each Object from that which strikes our Senses Even our own Eyes do not always represent Objects to us after the same manner In the  Jaundice  every one knows that all things seem yellow Is it not therefore  highly probable those Animals in whose Eyes we discern a very different Texture from that of ours and whose Bodies abound with different Humors do not see the same Colours in every Object that we do From all which shou'd it not seem to follow that all Colours are equally apparent and that none of those which we perceive are really inherent in any outward Object  Hyl  It shou'd  Phil  The Point will be past all doubt if you consider that in case Colours were real Properties or Affections inherent in external Bodies they cou'd admit of no Alteration without some Change wrought in the very Bodies themselves But is it not evident from what has been said that upon the Use of Microscopes upon a Change happening in the Humors of the Eye or a Variation of Distance without any manner of real Alteration in the Thing itself the Colours of any Object are either changed or totally disappear Nay all other Circumstances remaining the same change but the Situation of some Objects and they shall present different Colours to the Eye The same thing happens upon viewing an Object in various Degrees of Light And what is more known than that the same Bodies appear differently coloured by Candlelight from what they do in the open Day Add to these the Experiment  of a Prism which separating the heterogeneous Rays of Light alters the Colour of any Object and will cause the Whitest to appear of a deep Blue or Red to the naked Eye And now tell me whether you are still of Opinion that every Body has its true real Colour inhering in it and if you think it has I would fain know farther from you what certain Distance and Position of the Object what peculiar Texture and Formation of the Eye what Degree or Kind of Light is necessary for ascertaining that true Colour and distinguishing it from apparent ones  Hyl  I own myself intirely satisfied that they are all equally apparent and that there is no such thing as Colour really inhering in external Bodies but that it is altogether in the Light And what confirms me in this Opinion is that in proportion to the Light Colours are still more or less vivid and if there be no Light then are there no Colours perceived Besides allowing there are Colours on external Objects yet how is it possible for us to perceive them For no external Body affects the Mind unless it act first on our Organs of Sense But the only Action of Bodies is Motion and Motion cannot be communicated otherwise than by Impulse A distant Object therefore cannot act on the Eye nor consequently make  itself or its Properties perceivable to the Soul Whence it plainly follows that it is immediately some contiguous Substance which operating on the Eye occasions a Perception of Colours And such is Light  Phil  How is Light then a Substance  Hyl  I tell you  Philonous  external Light is nothing but a thin fluid Substance whose minute Particles being agitated with a brisk Motion and in various Manners reflected from the different Surfaces of outward Objects to the Eyes communicate different Motions to the Optick Nerves which being propagated to the Brain cause therein various Impressions And these are attended with the Sensations of Red Blue Yellow  c  Phil  It seems then the Light does no more than shake the Optick Nerves  Hyl  Nothing else  Phil  And consequent to each particular Motion of the Nerves the Mind is affected with a Sensation which is some particular Colour  Hyl  Right  Phil  And these Sensations have no Existence without the Mind  Hyl  They have not  Phil  How then do you affirm that Colours are in the Light since by  Light  you understand a corporeal Substance external to the Mind  Hyl  Light and Colours as immediately perceived by us I grant cannot exist without the Mind But in themselves they consist intirely in the Motions and Configurations of certain insensible Particles of Matter  Phil  Colours then in the vulgar Sense or taken for the immediate Objects of Sight cannot agree to any but a perceiving Substance  Hyl  That is what I say  Phil  Well then since you give up the Point as to those sensible Qualities which are alone thought Colours by all Mankind beside you may hold what you please with regard to those invisible ones of the Philosophers It is not my Business to dispute about them only I would advise you to think whether considering the Inquiry we are upon it be prudent for you to affirm  the Red and Blue which we see are not real Colours but certain unknown Motions and Figures which no Man ever did or can see are truly so  Are not these shocking Notions and are not they subject to as many ridiculous Inferences as those you before renounced in the Case of Sounds  Hyl  I frankly own  Philonous  that it is in vain to stand out any longer Colours Sounds Tastes in a word all those termed  Secondary Qualities  have certainly no Existence without the Mind But by this  Acknowlegement I must not be supposed to derogate any thing from the Reality of Matter or external Objects seeing it is no more than several Philosophers maintain who nevertheless are the farthest imaginable from denying Matter For the clearer Understanding of this you must know sensible Qualities are by Philosophers divided into  Primary  and  Secondary  The former are Extension Figure Solidity Gravity Motion and Rest and these they hold exist really in Bodies The latter are those above enumerated or briefly all sensible Qualities beside the Primary which they assert are only so many Sensations or Ideas existing no where but in the Mind But all this I doubt not you are already apprised of For my part I have been a long time sensible there was such an Opinion current among Philosophers but was never thorowly convinced of its Truth till now  Phil  You are still then of Opinion that Extension and Figures are inherent in external unthinking Substances  Hyl  I am  Phil  But what if the same Arguments which are brought against Secondary Qualities will hold good against these also  Hyl  Why then I shall be obliged to think they too exist only in the Mind  Phil  Is it your Opinion the very Figure and Extension which you perceive by Sense exist in the outward Object or material Substance  Hyl  It is  Phil  Have all other Animals as good Grounds to think the same of the Figure and Extension which they see and feel  Hyl  Without doubt if they have any Thought at all  Phil  Answer me  Hylas  Think you the Senses were bestowed upon all Animals for their Preservation and WellBeing in Life or were they given to Men alone for this End  Hyl  I make no question but they have the same Use in all other Animals  Phil  If so is it not necessary they should be enabled by them to perceive their own Limbs and those Bodies which are capable of harming them  Hyl  Certainly  Phil  A Mite therefore must be supposed to see his own Foot and Things equal or even less than it as Bodies of some considerable Dimension tho at the same time they appear to you scarce discernible or at best as so many visible Points  Hyl  I cannot deny it  Phil  And to Creatures less than the Mite they will seem yet larger  Hyl  They will  Phil  Insomuch that what you can hardly discern will to another extremely minute Animal appear as some huge Mountain  Hyl  All this I grant  Phil  Can one and the same thing be at the same time in itself of different Dimensions  Hyl  That were absurd to imagine  Phil  But from what you have laid down it follows that both the Extension by you perceived and that perceived by the Mite itself as likewise all those perceived by lesser Animals are each of them the true Extension of the Mite's Foot that is to say by your own Principles you are led into an Absurdity  Hyl  There seems to be some Difficulty in the Point  Phil  Again have you not acknowledged that no real inherent Property of any Object can be changed without some Change in the thing itself  Hyl  I have  Phil  But as we approach to or recede from an Object the visible Extension varies being at one Distance ten or an hundred times greater than at another Does it not therefore follow from hence likewise that it is not really inherent in the Object  Hyl  I own I am at a Loss what to think  Phil  Your Judgment will soon be determined if you will venture to think as freely with relation to this Quality as you have done in respect of the rest Was it not admitted as a good Argument that neither Heat nor Cold was in the Water because it seemed warm to one Hand and cold to the other  Hyl  It was  Phil  Is it not the very same Reasoning to conclude there is no Extension or Figure in an Object because to one Eye it shall seem little smooth and round when at the same time it appears to the other great uneven and angular  Hyl  The very same But does this latter Fact ever happen  Phil  You may at any time make the Experiment by looking with one Eye bare and with the other thro a Microscope  Hyl  I know not how to maintain it and yet I am loath to give up  Extension  I see so many od Consequences following upon such a Concession  Phil  Od  say you After the Concessions already made I hope you will stick at nothing for its Odness  Hyl  I give up the Point for the present reserving still a Right to retract my Opinion in case I shall hereafter discover any false Step in my Progress to it  Phil  That is a Right you cannot be denied Figures and Extension being dispatched we proceed next to  Motion  Can a real Motion in any external Body be at the same time both very swift and very slow  Hyl  It cannot  Phil  Is not the Motion of a Body swift in a reciprocal Proportion to the time it takes up in describing any given Space Thus a Body that describes a Mile in an Hour moves three times faster than it would in case it described only a Mile in three Hours  Hyl  I agree with you  Phil  And is not Time measured by the Succession of Ideas in our Minds  Hyl  It is  Phil  And is it not possible Ideas should succeed one another twice as fast in your Mind as they do in mine or in that of some Spirit of another Kind  Hyl  I own it  Phil  Consequently the same Body may to another seem to perform its Motion over any Space in half the time that it does to you And the same Reasoning will hold as to any other Proportion That is to say according to your Principles since the Motions perceived are both really in the Object it is possible one and the same Body shall be really moved the same way at once both very swift and very slow How is this consistent  either with common Sense or what you just now granted  Hyl  I have nothing to say to it  Phil  Then as for  Solidity  either you do not mean any sensible Quality by that Word and so it is beside our Inquiry Or if you do it must be either Hardness or Resistance But both the one and the other are plainly relative to our Senses It being evident that what seems hard to one Animal may appear soft to another who hath greater Force and Firmness of Limbs Nor is it less plain that the Resistance I feel is not in the Body  Hyl  I own the very Sensation of Resistance which is all you immediately perceive is not in the Body but the Cause of that Sensation is  Phil  But the Causes of our Sensations are not Things immediately perceived and therefore not sensible This Point I thought had been already determined  Hyl  I own it was but you will pardon me if I seem a little embarrassed I know not how to quit my old Notions  Phil  To help you out do but consider that if Extension be once acknowleged to have no Existence without the Mind the same must necessarily be granted of Motion Solidity and Gravity since they all evidently suppose Extension It is therefore superfluous to inquire particularly concerning each of  them In denying Extension you have denied them all to have any real Existence  Hyl  I wonder  Philonous  if what you say be true why those Philosophers who deny the Secondary Qualities any real Existence should yet attribute it to the Primary If there is no Difference between them how can this be accounted for  Phil  It is not my Business to account for every Opinion of the Philosophers But among other Reasons which may be assigned for this it seems probable that Pleasure and Pain being rather annexed to the former than the latter may be one Heat and Cold Tastes Smells  c  have something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than the Ideas of Extension Figure and Motion affect us with And it being too visibly absurd to hold that Pain or Pleasure can be in an unperceiving Substance Men are more easily weaned from believing the external Existence of the Secondary than the Primary Qualities You will be satisfied there is something in this if you recollect the Difference you made between an intense and more moderate Degree of Heat allowing the one a real Existence while you denied it to the other But after all there is no rational Ground for that Distinction for surely an indifferent Sensation is as truly  a Sensation  as one more pleasing or painful and consequently should not  any more than they be supposed to exist in an unthinking Subject  Hyl  It is just come into my Head  Philonous  that I have somewhere heard of a Distinction between absolute and sensible Extension Now though it be acknowledged that  great  and  small  consisting meerly in the Relation which other extended Beings have to the Parts of our own Bodies do not really inhere in the Substances themselves yet nothing obliges us to hold the same with regard to  absolute Extension  which is something abstracted from  great  and  small  from this or that particular Magnitude or Figure So likewise as to Motion  swift  and  slow  are altogether relative to the Succession of Ideas in our own Minds But it does not follow because those Modifications of Motion exist not without the Mind that therefore absolute Motion abstracted from them does not  Phil  Pray what is it that distinguishes one Motion or Part of Extension from another is it not something sensible as some Degree of Swiftness or Slowness some certain Magnitude or Figure peculiar to each  Hyl  I think so  Phil  These Qualities therefore stripped of all sensible Properties are without all specific and numerical Differences as the Schools call them  Hyl  They are  Phil  That is to say they are Extension in general and Motion in general  Hyl  Let it be so  Phil  But it is an universally received Maxim that  Every thing which exists is particular  How then can Motion in general or Extension in general exist in any corporeal Substance  Hyl  I will take time to solve your Difficulty  Phil  But I think the Point may be speedily decided Without doubt you can tell whether you are able to frame this or that Idea Now I am content to put our Dispute on this Issue If you can frame in your Thoughts a distinct abstract Idea of Motion or Extension divested of all those sensible Modes as swift and slow great and small round and square and the like which are acknowleged to exist only in the Mind I will then yield the Point you contend for But if you cannot it will be unreasonable on your Side to insist any longer upon what you have no Notion of  Hyl  To confess ingenuously I cannot  Phil  Can you even separate the Ideas of Extension and Motion from the Ideas of Light and Colours hard and soft hot and cold with the rest of those Qualities which they who make the Distinction term  Secondary  Hyl  What Is it not an easy Matter to consider Extension and Motion by themselves abstracted from all other sensible Qualities Pray how do the Mathematicians treat of them  Phil  I acknowlege  Hylas  it is not difficult to form general Propositions and Reasonings about those Qualities without mentioning any other and in this Sense to consider or treat of them abstractedly But how does it follow that because I can pronounce the Word  Motion  by itself I can form the Idea of it in my Mind exclusive of Body or because Theoremes may be made of Extension and Figures without any mention of  Great  or  Small  or any other sensible Mode or Quality That therefore it is possible such an abstract Idea of Extension without any particular Size Colour  c  shou'd be distinctly formed and apprehended by the Mind Mathematicians treat of Quantity without regarding what other sensible Qualities it is attended with as being altogether indifferent to their Demonstrations But when laying aside the Words they contemplate the bare Ideas I believe you will find they are not the pure abstracted Ideas of Extension  Hyl  But what say you to  pure Intellect  may not abstracted Ideas be framed by that Faculty  Phil  Since I cannot frame abstract Ideas at all it is plain I cannot frame them by the Help of  pure Intellect  whatsoever Faculty you understand by those Words Besides not to inquire into the Nature of pure Intellect and its spiritual Objects as  Vertue Reason God  or the like thus much seems manifest that sensible Things are only to be perceived by Sense or represented by the Imagination Figures therefore and Extension being originally perceived by Sense do not belong to pure Intellect But for your farther Satisfaction try if you can frame the Idea of any Figure abstracted from all Particularities of Size or even from other sensible Qualities  Hyl  Let me think a littleI do not find that I can  Phil  And can you think it possible that shou'd really exist in Nature which implies a Repugnancy in its Conception  Hyl  By no means  Phil  Since therefore it is impossible even for the Mind to disunite the Ideas of Extension and Motion from all other sensible Qualities does it not follow that where the one exist there necessarily the other exist likewise  Hyl  It should seem so  Phil  Consequently the very same Arguments which you admitted as conclusive against the Secondary Qualities are without  any farther Application of Force against the Primary too Besides if you will trust your Senses is it not plain all sensible Qualities coexist or to them appear as being in the same Place Do they ever represent a Motion or Figure as being divested of all other visible and tangible Qualities  Hyl  You need say no more on this Head I am free to own if there be no secret Error or Oversight in our Proceedings hitherto that all sensible Qualities are alike to be denied Existence without the Mind But my Fear is that I have been too liberal in my former Concessions or overlooked some Fallacy or other In short I did not take time to think  Phil  For that matter  Hylas  you may take what time you please in reviewing the Progress of our Inquiry You are at liberty to recover any Slips you might have made or offer whatever you have omitted which makes for your first Opinion  Hyl  One great Oversight I take to be this That I did not sufficiently distinguish the  Object  from the  Sensation  Now tho this latter may not exist without the Mind yet it will not thence follow that the former cannot  Phil  What Object do you mean the Object of the Senses  Hyl  The same  Phil  It is then immediately perceived  Hyl  Right  Phil  Make me to understand the Difference between what is immediately perceived and a Sensation  Hyl  The Sensation I take to be an Act of the Mind perceiving beside which there is something perceived and this I call the  Object  For Example there is Red and Yellow on that Tulip But then the Act of perceiving those Colours is in me only and not in the Tulip  Phil  What Tulip do you speak of is it that which you see  Hyl  The same  Phil  And what do you see beside Colour Figure and Extension  Hyl  Nothing  Phil  What you would say then is that the Red and Yellow are coexistent with the Extension is it not  Hyl  That is not all I wou'd say They have a real Existence without the Mind in some unthinking Substance  Phil  That the Colours are really in the Tulip which I see is manifest Neither can it be denied that this Tulip may exist independent of your Mind or mine but that any immediate Object of the Senses  i e  any Idea or Combination of Ideas should exist in an unthinking Substance or exterior to all  Minds is in itself an evident Contradiction Nor can I imagine how this follows from what you said just now  viz  that the Red and Yellow were on the Tulip  you saw  since you do not pretend to  see  that unthinking Substance  Hyl  You have an artful way  Philonous  of diverting our Inquiry from the Subject  Phil  I see you have no mind to be pressed that way To return then to your Distinction between  Sensation  and  Object  if I take you right you distinguish in every Perception two things the one an Action of the Mind the other not  Hyl  True  Phil  And this Action cannot exist in or belong to any unthinking thing but whatever beside is implied in a Perception may  Hyl  That is my Meaning  Phil  So that if there was a Perception without any Act of the Mind it were possible such a Perception should exist in an unthinking Substance  Hyl  I grant it But it is impossible there should be such a Perception  Phil  When is the Mind said to be active  Hyl  When it produces puts an end to or changes any thing  Phil  Can the Mind produce discontinue or change any thing but by an Act of the Will  Hyl  It cannot  Phil  The Mind therefore is to be accounted active in its Perceptions so far forth as Volition is included in them  Hyl  It is  Phil  In plucking this Flower I am active because I do it by the Motion of my Hand which was consequent upon my Volition so likewise in applying it to my Nose But is either of these Smelling  Hyl  No  Phil  I act too in drawing the Air thro my Nose because my Breathing so rather than otherwise is the Effect of my Volition But neither can this be called  Smelling  For if it were I shou'd smell every time I breathed in that manner  Hyl  True  Phil  Smelling then is somewhat consequent to all this  Hyl  It is  Phil  But I do not find my Will concerned any farther Whatever more there is as that I perceive such a particular Smell or any Smell at all this is independent of my Will and therein I am altogether passive Do you find it otherwise with you  Hylas  Hyl  No the very same  Phil  Then as to Seeing is it not in your Power to open your Eyes or keep them shut to turn them this or that way  Hyl  Without doubt  Phil  But does it in like manner depend on your Will that in looking on this Flower you perceive  White  rather than any other Colour or directing your open Eyes toward yonder Part of the Heaven can you avoid seeing the Sun or is Light or Darkness the Effect of your Volition  Hyl  No certainly  Phil  You are then in these Respects altogether Passive  Hyl  I am  Phil  Tell me now whether  Seeing  consists in perceiving Light and Colours or in opening and turning the Eyes  Hyl  Without doubt in the former  Phil  Since therefore you are in the very Perception of Light and Colours altogether passive what is become of that Action you were speaking of as an Ingredient in every Sensation And does it not follow from your own Concessions that the Perception of Light and Colours including no Action in it may exist in an unperceiving Substance And is not this a plain Contradiction  Hyl  I know not what to think of it  Phil  Besides since you distinguish the  Active  and  Passive  in every Perception you must do it in that of Pain But how is it possible that Pain be it as little active as you please should exist in an unperceiving Substance  In short do but consider the Point and then confess ingenuously whether Light and Colours Tastes Sounds  c  are not all equally Passions or Sensations in the Soul You may indeed call them  external Objects  and give them in Words what Subsistence you please But examine your own Thoughts and then tell me whether it be not as I say  Hyl  I acknowlege  Philonous  that upon a fair Observation of what passes in my Mind I can discover nothing else but that I am a thinking Being affected with Variety of Sensations neither is it possible to conceive how a Sensation should exist in an unperceiving Substance But then on the other hand when I look on sensible Things in a different View considering them as so many Modes and Qualities I find it necessary to suppose a material  Substratum  without which they cannot be conceived to exist  Phil  Material Substratum  call you it Pray by which of your Senses came you acquainted with that Being  Hyl  It is not itself sensible its Modes and Qualities only being perceived by the Senses  Phil  I presume then it was by Reflexion and Reason you obtained the Idea of it  Hyl  I do not pretend to any proper positive Idea of it However I conclude it exists because Qualities cannot be conceived to exist without a Support  Phil  It seems then you have only a relative Notion of it or that you conceive it not otherwise than by conceiving the Relation it bears to sensible Qualities  Hyl  Right  Phil  Be pleased therefore to let me know wherein that Relation consists  Hyl  Is it not sufficiently expressed in the Term  Substratum  or  Substance  Phil  If so the Word  Substratum  should import that it is spread under the sensible Qualities or Accidents  Hyl  True  Phil  And consequently under Extension  Hyl  I own it  Phil  It is therefore somewhat in its own Nature intirely distinct from Extension  Hyl  I tell you Extension is only a Mode and Matter is something that supports Modes And is it not evident the Thing supported is different from the thing supporting  Phil  So that something distinct from and exclusive of Extension is supposed to be the  Substratum  of Extension  Hyl  Just so  Phil  Answer me  Hylas  Can a thing be spread without Extension or is not the Idea of Extension necessarily included in  Spreading  Hyl  It is  Phil  Whatsoever therefore you suppose spread under any thing must have in itself an Extension distinct from the Extension of that Thing under which it is spread  Hyl  It must  Phil  Consequently every corporeal Substance being the  Substratum  of Extension must have in itself another Extension by which it is qualified to be a  Substratum  And so on to Infinity And I ask whether this be not absurd in itself and repugnant to what you granted just now  viz  that the  Substratum  was something distinct from and exclusive of Extension  Hyl  Ay but  Philonous  you take me wrong I do not mean that Matter is  spread  in a gross literal Sense under Extension The Word  Substratum  is used only to express in general the same thing with  Substance  Phil  Well then let us examine the Relation implied in the Term  Substance  Is it not that it stands under Accidents  Hyl  The very same  Phil  But that one thing may stand under or support another must it not be extended  Hyl  It must  Phil  Is not therefore this Supposition liable to the same Absurdity with the former  Hyl  You still take Things in a strict literal Sense That is not fair  Philonous  Phil  I am not for imposing any Sense on your Words You are at Liberty to explain them as you please Only I beseech you make me understand something by them You tell me Matter supports or stands under Accidents How is it as your Legs support your Body  Hyl  No that is the literal Sense  Phil  Pray let me know any Sense literal or not literal that you understand it inHow long must I wait for an Answer  Hylas  Hyl  I declare I know not what to say I once thought I understood well enough what was meant by Matter's supporting Accidents But now the more I think on it the less can I comprehend it in short I find that I know nothing of it  Phil  It seems then you have no Idea at all neither relative nor positive of Matter you know neither what it is in itself nor what Relation it bears to Accidents  Hyl  I acknowlege it  Phil  And yet you asserted that you could not conceive how Qualities or Accidents should really exist without conceiving at the same time a material Support of them  Hyl  I did  Phil  That is to say when you conceive the real Existence of Qualities you do withal  conceive something which you cannot conceive  Hyl  It was wrong I own But still I fear there is some Fallacy or other Pray what think you of this It is just come into my Head that the Ground of all our Mistake lies in your treating of each Quality by itself Now I grant that each Quality cannot singly subsist without the Mind Colour cannot without Extension neither can Figure without some other sensible Quality But as the several Qualities united or blended together form intire sensible Things nothing hinders why such things may not be supposed to exist without the Mind  Phil  Either  Hylas  you are jesting or have a very bad Memory Though indeed we went through all the Qualities by Name one after another yet my Arguments or rather your Concessions no where tended to prove that the Secondary Qualities did not subsist each alone by itself but that they were not  at all  without the Mind Indeed in treating of Figure and Motion we concluded they could not exist without the Mind because it was impossible even in Thought to separate them from all Secondary Qualities so as to conceive them existing by themselves But then this was not the only Argument made Use of upon that Occasion But to pass by all that hath been  hitherto said and reckon it for nothing if you will have it so I am content to put the whole upon this Issue If you can conceive it possible for any Mixture or Combination of Qualities or any sensible Object whatever to exist without the Mind then I will grant it actually to be so  Hyl  If it comes to that the Point will soon be decided What more easy than to conceive a Tree or House existing by itself independent of and unperceived by any Mind whatsoever I do at this present time conceive them existing after that Manner  Phil  How say you  Hylas  can you see a thing which is at the same time unseen  Hyl  No that were a Contradiction  Phil  Is it not as great a Contradiction to talk of  conceiving  a thing which is  unconceived  Hyl  It is  Phil  The Tree or House therefore which you think of is conceived by you  Hyl  How should it be otherwise  Phil  And what is conceived is surely in the Mind  Hyl  Without Question that which is conceived is in the Mind  Phil  How then came you to say you conceived a House or Tree existing independent and out of all Minds whatsoever  Hyl  That was I own an Oversight but stay let me consider what led me into itIt is a pleasant Mistake enough As I was thinking of a Tree in a solitary Place where no one was present to see it methought that was to conceive a Tree as existing unperceived or unthought of not considering that I myself conceived it all the while But now I plainly see that all I can do is to frame Ideas in my own Mind I may indeed conceive in my own Thoughts the Idea of a Tree or a House or a Mountain but that is all And this is far from proving that I can conceive them  existing out of the Minds of all Spirits  Phil  You acknowlege then that you cannot possibly conceive how any one corporeal sensible Thing should exist otherwise than in a Mind  Hyl  I do  Phil  And yet you will earnestly contend for the Truth of that which you cannot so much as conceive  Hyl  I profess I know not what to think but still there are some Scruples remain with me Is it not certain I see Things at a Distance do we not perceive the Stars and Moon for Example to be a great way off Is not this I say manifest to the Senses  Phil  Do you not in a Dream too perceive those or the like Objects  Hyl  I do  Phil  And have they not then the same Appearance of being distant  Hyl  They have  Phil  But you do not thence conclude the Apparitions in a Dream to be without the Mind  Hyl  By no means  Phil  You ought not therefore to conclude that sensible Objects are without the Mind from their Appearance or Manner wherein they are perceived  Hyl  I acknowlege it But doth not my Sense deceive me in those Cases  Phil  By no Means The Idea or Thing which you immediately perceive neither Sense nor Reason informs you that it actually exists without the Mind By Sense you only know that you are affected with such certain Sensations of Light and Colours  c  And these you will not say are without the Mind  Hyl  True But beside all that do you not think the Sight suggests something of  Outness  or  Distance  Phil  Upon approaching a distant Object do the visible Size and Figure change perpetually or do they appear the same at all Distances  Hyl  They are in a continual Change  Phil  Sight therefore does not suggest or any way inform you that the visible Object you immediately perceive exists at a Distance  or will be perceived when you advance farther onward there being a continued Series of visible Objects succeeding each other during the whole Time of your Approach  Hyl  It does not but still I know upon seeing an Object what Object I shall perceive after having passed over a certain Distance No matter whether it be exactly the same or no There is still something of Distance suggested in the Case  Phil  Good  Hylas  do but reflect a little on the Point and then tell me whether there be any more in it than this From the Ideas you actually perceive by Sight you have by Experience learned to collect what other Ideas you will according to the standing Order of Nature be affected with after such a certain Succession of Time and Motion  Hyl  Upon the Whole I take it to be nothing else  Phil  Now is it not plain that if we suppose a Man born blind was on a sudden made to see he could at first have no Experience of what may be suggested by Sight  Hyl  It is  Phil  He would not then according to you have any Notion of Distance annexed to the Things he saw but would take them for a new Sett of Sensations existing only in his Mind  Hyl  It is undeniable  Phil  But to make it still more plain is not  Distance  a Line turned endwise to the Eye  Hyl  It is  Phil  And can a Line so situated be perceived by Sight  Hyl  It cannot  Phil  Does it not therefore follow that Distance is not properly and immediately perceived by Sight  Hyl  It should seem so  Phil  Again is it your Opinion that Colours are at a Distance  Hyl  It must be acknowleged they are only in the Mind  Phil  But do not Colours appear to the Eye as coexisting in the same place with Extension and Figures  Hyl  They do  Phil  How can you then conclude from Sight that Figures exist without when you acknowlege Colours do not the sensible Appearance being the very same with regard to both  Hyl  I know not what to answer  Phil  But allowing that Distance was truly and immediately perceived by the Mind yet it wou'd not thence follow it existed out of the Mind For whatever is immediately perceived is an Idea And can any  Idea  exist out of the Mind  Hyl  To suppose that were absurd But inform me  Philonous  can we perceive or know nothing beside our Ideas  Phil  As for the rational deducing of Causes from Effects that is beside our Inquiry And by the Senses you can best tell whether you perceive any thing which is not immediately perceived And I ask you whether the Things immediately perceived are other than your own Sensations or Ideas You have indeed more than once in the Course of this Conversation expressed yourself on those Points but you seem by this last Question to have departed from what you then thought  Hyl  To speak the truth  Philonous  I think there are two Kinds of Objects the one perceived immediately which are likewise called  Ideas  the other are real Things or external Objects perceived by the Mediation of Ideas which are their Images and Representations Now I own Ideas cannot exist without the Mind but the latter sort of Objects do I am sorry I did not think of this Distinction sooner it would probably have cut short your Discourse  Phil  Are those external Objects perceived by Sense or by some other Faculty  Hyl  They are perceived by Sense  Phil  How Is there any thing perceived by Sense which is not immediately perceived  Hyl  Yes  Philonous  in some sort there is For Example when I look on a Picture or Statue of  Julius Caesar  I may be said after a manner to perceive him tho' not immediately by my Senses  Phil  It seems then you will have our Ideas which alone are immediately perceived to be Pictures of external Things And that these also are perceived by Sense inasmuch as they have a Conformity or Resemblance to our Ideas  Hyl  That is my Meaning  Phil  And in the same way that  Julius Caesar  in himself invisible is nevertheless perceived by Sight real Things in themselves imperceptible are perceived by Sense  Hyl  In the very same  Phil  Tell me  Hylas  when you behold the Picture of  Julius Caesar  do you see with your Eyes any more than some Colours and Figures with a certain Symmetry and Composition of the whole  Hyl  Nothing else  Phil  And wou'd not a Man who had never known any thing of  Julius Caesar  see as much  Hyl  He wou'd  Phil  Consequently he hath his Sight and the Use of it in as perfect a Degree as you  Hyl  I agree with you  Phil  Whence comes it then that your Thoughts are directed to the  Roman  Emperor and his are not This cannot proceed from the Sensations or Ideas of Sense by you then perceived since you acknowlege you have no Advantage over him in that respect It should seem therefore to proceed from Reason and Memory shou'd it not  Hyl  It shou'd  Phil  Consequently it will not follow from that Instance that any thing is perceived by Sense which is not immediately perceived Tho' I grant we may in one Acceptation be said to perceive sensible Things mediately by Sense That is when from a frequently perceived Connexion the immediate Perception of Ideas by one Sense suggests to the Mind others perhaps belonging to another Sense which are wont to be connected with them For instance when I hear a Coach drive along the Streets immediately I perceive only the Sound but from the Experience I have had that such a Sound is connected with a Coach I am said to hear the Coach It is nevertheless evident that in Truth and Strictness nothing can be  heard  but  Sound  And the Coach is not then properly perceived by Sense but suggested from Experience So likewise when we are said to see a redhot Bar of Iron the Solidity and Heat of the Iron are not the Objects of Sight but suggested to the  Imagination by the Colour and Figure which are properly perceived by that Sense In short those things alone are actually perceived by any Sense which would have been perceived in case that same Sense had then been first conferred on us As for other things it is plain they are only suggested to the Mind by Experience grounded on former Perceptions But to return to your Comparison of  Caesar  's Picture it is plain if you keep to that you must hold the real Things or Archetypes of our Ideas are not perceived by Sense but by some internal Faculty of the Soul as Reason or Memory I wou'd therefore fain know what Arguments you can draw from Reason for the Existence of what you call  real Things  or  material Objects  Or whether you remember to have seen them formerly as they are in themselves or if you have heard or read of any one that did  Hyl  I see  Philonous  you are disposed to Raillery but that will never convince me  Phil  My Aim is only to learn from you the way to come at the Knowlege of those  material Beings  Whatever we perceive is perceived either immediately or mediately By Sense or by Reason and Reflexion But as you have excluded Sense pray shew me what Reason you have to believe their Existence or what  medium  you can possibly make use of to prove it either to mine or your own Understanding  Hyl  To deal ingenuously  Philonous  now I consider the Point I do not find I can give you any good Reason for it But thus much seems pretty plain that it is at least possible such things may really exist And as long as there is no Absurdity in supposing them I am resolved to believe as I did till you bring good Reasons to the contrary  Phil  What Is it come to this that you only believe the Existence of material Objects and that your Belief is founded barely on the Possibility of its being true Then you will have me bring Reasons against it Tho another would think it reasonable the Proof should lie on him who holds the Affirmative And after all this very Point which you are now resolved to maintain without any Reason is in effect what you have more than once during this Discourse seen good Reason to give up But to pass over all this if I understand you rightly you say our Ideas do not exist without the Mind but that they are Copies Images or Representations of certain Originals that do  Hyl  You take me right  Phil  They are then like external Things  Hyl  They are  Phil  Have those Things a stable and permanent Nature independent of our Senses or are they in a perpetual Change upon our producing any Motions in our Bodies suspending  exerting or altering our Faculties or Organs of Sense  Hyl  Real Things it is plain have a fixed and real Nature which remains the same notwithstanding any Change in our Senses or in the Posture and Motion of our Bodies which indeed may affect the Ideas in our Minds but it were absurd to think they had the same Effect on Things existing without the Mind  Phil  How then is it possible that Things perpetually fleeting and variable as our Ideas should be Copies or Images of any thing fixed and constant Or in other Words since all sensible Qualities as Size Figure Colour  c i e  our Ideas are continually changing upon every Alteration in the Distance Medium or Instruments of Sensation how can any determinate material Object be properly represented or painted forth by several distinct Things each of which is so different from and unlike the rest Or if you say it resembles some one only of our Ideas how shall we be able to distinguish the true Copy from all the false ones  Hyl  I profess  Philonous  I am at a Loss I know not what to say to this  Phil  But neither is this all Which are material Objects in themselves Perceptible or Imperceptible  Hyl  Properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but Ideas All material Things therefore are in themselves insensible and to be perceived only by their Ideas  Phil  Ideas then are sensible and their Archetypes or Originals insensible  Hyl  Right  Phil  But how can that which is sensible be like that which is insensible Can a real thing in itself  invisible  be like a  Colour  or a real thing which is not  audible  be like a  Sound  In a word Can any thing be like a Sensation or Idea but another Sensation or Idea  Hyl  I must own I think not  Phil  Is it possible there should be any Doubt in the Point Do you not perfectly know your own Ideas  Hyl  I know them perfectly since what I do not perceive or know can be no Part of my Idea  Phil  Consider therefore and examine them and then tell me if there be any thing in them which can exist without the Mind or if you can conceive any thing like them existing without the Mind  Hyl  Upon Inquiry I find it is impossible for me to conceive or understand how any thing but an Idea can be like an Idea And it is most evident that  no Idea can exist without the Mind  Phil  You are therefore by your Principles forced to deny the Reality of sensible Things since you made it to consist in an absolute Existence exterior to the Mind That is to say you are a downright  Sceptic  So I have gained my Point which was to shew your Principles led to Scepticism  Hyl  For the present I am if not intirely convinced at least silenced  Phil  I wou'd fain know what more you wou'd require in order to a perfect Conviction Have you not had the Liberty of explaining yourself all manner of ways Were any little Slips in Discourse laid hold and insisted on Or were you not allowed to retract or reinforce any thing you had offered as best served your Purpose Has not every thing you could say been heard and examined with all the Fairness imaginable In a word have you not in every Point been convinced out of your own Mouth And if you can at present discover any Flaw in any of your former Concessions or think of any remaining Subterfuge any new Distinction Colour or Comment whatsoever why do you not produce it  Hyl  A little Patience  Philonous  I am at present so amazed to see myself ensnared and as it were imprisoned in the Labyrinths you have drawn me into that on the suddain it cannot be expected I should find my Way  out You must give me Time to look about me and recollect myself  Phil  Hark Is not this the College Bell  Hyl  It rings for Prayers  Phil  We will go in then if you please and meet here again to Morrow Morning In the mean time you may employ your Thoughts on this Morning's Discourse and try if you can find any Fallacy in it or invent any new Means to extricate yourself  Hyl  Agreed  The Second DIALOGUE  Hylas  _I BEG your Pardon  Philonous  for not meeting you sooner All this Morning my Head was so filled with our late Conversation that I had not Leisure to think of the Time of the Day or indeed of any thing else  Philonous  I am glad you were so intent upon it in Hopes if there were any Mistakes in your Concessions or Fallacies in my Reasonings from them you will now discover them to me  Hyl  I assure you I have done nothing ever since I saw you but search after Mistakes and Fallacies and with that View have minutely examined the whole Series of Yesterday's Discourse but all in vain for the Notions it led me into upon Review appear still more  clear and evident and the more I consider them the more irresistibly do they force my Assent  Phil  And is not this think you a Sign that they are genuine that they proceed from Nature and are conformable to right Reason Truth and Beauty are in this alike that the nicest Survey sets them both off to Advantage Whilst the false Lustre of Error and Disguise cannot endure being review'd or too nearly inspected  Hyl  I own there is a great deal in what you say Nor can any one be more intirely satisfied of the Truth of those od Consequences so long as I have in View the Reasonings that lead to them But when these are out of my Thoughts there seems on the other hand something so satisfactory so natural and intelligible in the modern Way of explaining things that I profess I know not how to reject it  Phil  I know not what Way you mean  Hyl  I mean the Way of accounting for our Sensations or Ideas  Phil  How is that  Hyl  It is supposed the Soul makes her Residence in some Part of the Brain from which the Nerves take their Rise and are thence extended to all Parts of the Body And that outward Objects by the different Impressions they make on the Organs of Sense communicate  certain vibrative Motions to the Nerves and these being filled with Spirits propagate them to the Brain or Seat of the Soul which according to the various Impressions or Traces thereby made in the Brain is variously affected with Ideas  Phil  And call you this an Explication of the Manner whereby we are affected with Ideas  Hyl  Why not  Philonous  have you any thing to object against it  Phil  I wou'd first know whether I rightly understand your Hypothesis You make certain Traces in the Brain to be the Causes or Occasions of our Ideas Pray tell me whether by the  Brain  you mean any sensible Thing  Hyl  What else think you I cou'd mean  Phil  Sensible Things are all immediately perceivable and those Things which are immediately perceivable are Ideas and these exist only in the Mind Thus much you have if I mistake not long since agreed to  Hyl  I do not deny it  Phil  The Brain therefore you speak of being a sensible Thing exists only in the Mind Now I wou'd fain know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that one Idea or Thing existing in the Mind occasions all other Ideas And if you think so pray  how do you account for the Origine of that Primary Idea or Brain itself  Hyl  I do not explain the Origine of our Ideas by that Brain which is perceivable to Sense this being itself only a Combination of sensible Ideas but by another which I imagine  Phil  But are not Things imagined as truly in the Mind as Things perceived  Hyl  I must confess they are  Phil  It comes therefore to the same thing and you have been all the while accounting for Ideas by certain Motions or Impressions in the Brain  i e  by some Alterations in an Idea whether sensible or imaginable it matters not  Hyl  I begin to suspect my Hypothesis  Phil  Beside Spirits all that we know or conceive are our own Ideas When therefore you say all Ideas are occasioned by Impressions in the Brain do you conceive this Brain or no If you do then you talk of Ideas imprinted in an Idea causing that same Idea which is absurd If you do not conceive it you talk unintelligibly instead of forming a reasonable Hypothesis  Hyl  I now clearly see it was a meer Dream There is nothing in it  Phil  You need not be much concerned at it for after all this way of explaining Things as you called it could never have  satisfied any reasonable Man What Connexion is there between a Motion in the Nerves and the Sensations of Sound or Colour in the Mind or how is it possible these should be the Effect of that  Hyl  But I cou'd never think it had so little in it as now it seems to have  Phil  Well then are you at length satisfied that no sensible Things have a real Existence and that you are in truth an errant  Sceptic  Hyl  It is too plain to be denied  Phil  Look are not the Fields covered with a delightful Verdure Is there not something in the Woods and Groves in the Rivers and clear Springs that sooths that softens that transports the Soul At the Prospect of the wide and deep Ocean or some huge Mountain whose Top is lost in the Sky or of an old gloomy Forrest are not our Minds filled with a pleasing Horror Even in Rocks and Deserts is there not an agreeable Wildness How sincere a Pleasure is it to behold the natural Beauties of the Earth To preserve and renew our Relish for them is not the Veil of Night alternately drawn over her Face and does she not change her Dress with the Seasons How aptly are the Elements disposed What Variety and Use in Stones and Minerals What Delicacy what Beauty what Contrivance  in animal and vegetable Bodies How exquisitely are all things suited as well to their particular Ends as to constitute apposite Parts of the Whole And while they mutually aid and support do they not also set off and illustrate each other Raise now your Thoughts from this Ball of Earth to all those glorious Luminaries that adorn the high Arch of Heaven The Motion and Situation of the Planets are they not admirable for Use and Order Were those miscalled  Erratique  Globes once known to stray in their repeated Journeys thorow the pathless Void Do they not measure Areas round the Sun ever proportioned to the Times So fixed so immutable are the Laws by which the unseen Author of Nature actuates the Universe How vivid and radiant is the Lustre of the fixed Stars How magnificent and rich that negligent Profusion with which they appear to be scattered thorow the whole Azure Vault Yet if you take the Telescope it brings into your Sight a new Host of Stars that escape the naked Eye Here they seem contiguous and minute but to a nearer View immense Orbs of Light at various Distances far sunk in the Abyss of Space Now you must call Imagination to your Aid The feeble narrow Sense cannot descry innumerable Worlds revolving round the central Fires and in those Worlds the Energy of an allperfect  Mind display'd in endless Forms But neither Sense nor Imagination are big enough to comprehend the boundless Extent with all its dazzling Furniture Tho the laboring Mind exert and strain each Power to its utmost Reach there still stands our ungrasped a Surplusage immeasurable Yet all the vast Bodies that compose this mighty Frame how distant and remote soever are by some secret Mechanism some divine Art and Force linked in a mutual Dependence and Intercourse with each other even with this Earth which almost slipt from my Thoughts and was lost in the Croud of Worlds Is not the whole System immense beautiful glorious beyond Expression and beyond Thought What treatment then do those Philosophers deserve who wou'd deprive these noble and delightful Scenes of all Reality How shou'd those Principles be entertained that lead us to think all the visible Beauty of the Creation a false imaginary Glare To be plain can you expect this Scepticism of yours will not be thought extravagantly absurd by all Men of Sense  Hyl  Other Men may think as they please But for your Part you have nothing to reproach me with My Comfort is you are as much a  Sceptic  as I am  Phil  There  Hylas  I must beg Leave to differ from you  Hyl  What Have you all along agreed to the Premises and do you now deny the Conclusion and leave me to maintain those Paradoxes by myself which you led me into This surely is not fair  Phil  I deny that I agreed with you in those Notions that led to Scepticism You indeed said the Reality of sensible Things consisted in an  absolute Existence  out of the Minds of Spirits or distinct from their being perceived And pursuant to this Notion of Reality you are obliged to deny sensible Things any real Existence That is according to your own Definition you profess yourself a  Sceptic  But I neither said nor thought the Reality of sensible Things was to be defined after that Manner To me it is evident for the Reasons you allow of that sensible Things cannot exist otherwise than in a Mind or Spirit Whence I conclude not that they have no real Existence but that seeing they depend not on my Thought and have an Existence distinct from being perceived by me  there must be some other Mind wherein they exist  As sure therefore as the sensible World really exists so sure is there an infinite omnipresent Spirit who contains and supports it  Hyl  What This is no more than I and all Christians hold nay and all others too  who believe there is a God and that he knows and comprehends all Things  Phil  Ay but here lies the Difference Men commonly believe that all Things are known or perceived by God because they believed the Being of a God whereas I on the other side immediately and necessarily conclude the Being of a God because all sensible Things must be perceived by Him  Hyl  But so long as we all believe the same thing what matter is it how we come by that Belief  Phil  But neither do we agree in the same Opinion For Philosophers tho they acknowlege all corporeal Beings to be perceived by God yet they attribute to them an absolute Subsistence distinct from their being perceived by any Mind whatever which I do not Besides is there no Difference between saying  There is a God therefore he perceives all Things  and saying  Sensible Things do really exist and if they really exist they are necessarily perceived by an infinite Mind therefore there is an infinite Mind or God  This furnishes you with a direct and immediate Demonstration from a most evident Principle of the  Being of a God  Divines and Philosophers had proved beyond all Controversy from the Beauty and Usefulness of the several Parts of the Creation that it was the Workmanship of God But that setting aside all  Help of Astronomy and natural Philosophy all Contemplation of the Contrivance Order and Adjustment of Things an infinite Mind should be necessarily inferred from the bare Existence of the sensible World is an Advantage peculiar to them only who have made this easy Reflexion That the sensible World is that which we perceive by our several Senses and that nothing is perceived by the Senses beside Ideas and that no Idea or Archetype of an Idea can exist otherwise than in a Mind You may now without any laborious Search into the Sciences without any Subtilty of Reason or tedious Length of Discourse oppose and baffle the most strenuous Advocate for Atheism Those miserable Refuges whether in an eternal Succession of unthinking Causes and Effects or in a fortuitous Concourse of Atoms those wild Imaginations of  Vanini Hobbes  and  Spinosa  in a word the whole System of Atheism is it not intirely overthrown by this single Reflexion on the Repugnancy included in supposing the Whole or any Part even the most rude and shapeless of the visible World to exist without a Mind Let any one of those Abettors of Impiety but look into his own Thoughts and there try if he can conceive how so much as a Rock a Desert a Chaos or confused Jumble of Atoms how any thing at all either sensible or imaginable  can exist independent of a Mind and he need go no farther to be convinced of his Folly Can any thing be fairer than to put a Dispute on such an Issue and leave it to a Man himself to see if he can conceive even in Thought what he holds to be true in Fact and from a Notional to allow it a Real Existence  Hyl  It cannot be denied there is something highly serviceable to Religion in what you advance But do you not think it looks very like a Notion entertained by some eminent Moderns of  seeing all things in God  Phil  I wou'd gladly know that Opinion pray explain it to me  Hyl  They conceive that the Soul being immaterial is incapable of being united with material Things so as to perceive them in themselves but that she perceives them by her Union with the Substance of God which being spiritual is therefore purely intelligible or capable of being the immediate Object of a Spirit's Thought Besides the Divine Essence contains in it Perfections correspondent to each created Being and which are for that Reason proper to exhibit or represent them to the Mind  Phil  I do not understand how our Ideas which are Things altogether passive and inert can be the Essence or any Part or like any Part of the Essence or Substance of God who is an impassive indivisible purely active  Being Many more Difficulties and Objections there are which occur at first View against this Hypothesis but I shall only add that it is liable to all the Absurdities of the common Hypotheses in making a created World exist otherwise than in the Mind of a Spirit Beside all which it has this peculiar to itself that it makes that material World serve to no Purpose And if it pass for a good Argument against other Hypotheses in the Sciences that they suppose Nature or the Divine Wisdom to make something in vain or do that by tedious roundabout Methods which might have been performed in a much more easy and compendious way what shall we think of that Hypothesis which supposes the whole World made in vain  Hyl  But what say you are not you too of Opinion that we see all Things in God If I mistake not what you advance comes near it  Phil  I intirely agree with what the Holy Scripture saith  That in God we live and move and have our Being  But that we see Things in his Essence after the manner above set forth I am far from believing Take here in brief my Meaning It is evident that the Things I perceive are my own Ideas and that no Idea can exist unless it be in a Mind Nor is it less plain that these Ideas or Things by me perceived either themselves or their Archetypes exist independently of my Mind  since I know myself not to be their Author it being out of my Power to determine at Pleasure what particular Ideas I shall be affected with upon opening my Eyes or Ears They must therefore exist in some other Mind whose Will it is they should be exhibited to me The Things I say immediately perceived are Ideas or Sensations call them which you will But how can any Idea or Sensation exist in or be produced by any thing but a Mind or Spirit This indeed is inconceivable and to assert that which is inconceivable is to talk Nonsense Is it not  Hyl  Without doubt  Phil  But on the other hand it is very conceivable that they should exist in and be produced by a Spirit since this is no more than I daily experience in myself inasmuch as I perceive numberless Ideas and by an Act of my Will can form a great Variety of them and raise them up in my Imagination Tho' it must be confessed these Creatures of the Fancy are not altogether so distinct so strong vivid and permanent as those perceived by my Senses which latter are called  Real Things  From all which I conclude  there is a Mind which affects me every Moment with all the sensible Impressions I perceive  And from the Variety Order and Manner of these I conclude the Author of them to be  wise powerful and good beyond Comprehension  Mark it well I do not say I see Things by perceiving that which represents them in the intelligible Substance of God This I do not understand but I say The Things by me perceived are known by the Understanding and produced by the Will of an infinite Spirit And is not all this most plain and evident Is there any more in it than what a little Observation of our own Minds and that which passes in them not only enables us to conceive but also obliges us to acknowlege  Hyl  I think I understand you very clearly and own the Proof you give of a Deity seems no less evident than it is surprizing But allowing that God is the supreme and Universal Cause of all Things yet may not there still be a Third Nature beside Spirits and Ideas May we not admit a subordinate and limited Cause of our Ideas In a word may there not for all that be  Matter  Phil  How often must I inculcate the same thing You allow the Things immediately perceived by Sense to exist no where without the Mind But there is nothing perceived by Sense which is not perceived immediately therefore there is nothing sensible that exists without the Mind The Matter therefore which you still insist on is something intelligible I suppose something that may be discovered by Reason and not by Sense  Hyl  You are in the right  Phil  Pray let me know what Reasoning your Belief of Matter is grounded on and what this Matter is in your present Sense of it  Hyl  I find myself affected with various Ideas whereof I know I am not the Cause neither are they the Cause of themselves or of one another or capable of subsisting by themselves as being altogether inactive fleeting dependent Beings They have therefore some Cause distinct from me and them Of which I pretend to know no more than that it is  the Cause of my Ideas  And this thing whatever it be I call  Matter  Phil  Tell me  Hylas  has every one a Liberty to change the current proper Signification annexed to a common Name in any Language For Example suppose a Traveller shou'd tell you that in a certain Country Men might pass unhurt thorow the Fire and upon explaining himself you found he meant by the Word  Fire  that which others call  Water  Or if he shou'd assert there are Trees which walk upon two Legs meaning Men by the Term  Trees  Wou'd you think this reasonable  Hyl  No I shou'd think it very absurd Common Custom is the Standard of Propriety in Language And for any Man to affect speaking improperly is to pervert the Use of Speech and can never serve to a  better purpose than to protract and multiply Disputes where there is no Difference in Opinion  Phil  And does not  Matter  in the common current Acceptation of the Word signify an extended solid moveable unthinking inactive Substance  Hyl  It does  Phil  And has it not been made evident that no such Substance can possibly exist And tho it shou'd be allowed to exist yet how can that which is  inactive  be a  Cause  or that which is  unthinking  be a  Cause of Thought  You may indeed if you please annex to the Word  Matter  a contrary Meaning to what is vulgarly received and tell me you understand by it an unextended thinking active Being which is the Cause of our Ideas But what else is this than to play with Words and run into that very Fault you just now condemned with so much Reason I do by no means find fault with your Reasoning in that you collect a Cause from the  Phaenomena  But I deny that the Cause deducible by Reason can properly be termed  Matter  Hyl  There is indeed something in what you say But I am afraid you do not thorowly comprehend my Meaning I wou'd by no means be thought to deny that God or an Infinite Spirit is the Supreme Cause of all things All I contend for is that subordinate  to the Supreme Agent there is a Cause of a limited and inferior Nature which concurs in the Production of our Ideas not by any Act of Will or Spiritual Efficiency but by that Kind of Action which belongs to Matter  viz Motion  Phil  I find you are at every Turn relapsing into your old exploded Conceit of a moveable and consequently an extended Substance existing without the Mind What Have you already forgot you were convinced or are you willing I shou'd repeat what has been said on that Head In truth this is not fair Dealing in you still to suppose the Being of that which you have so often acknowleged to have no Being But not to insist farther on what has been so largely handled I ask whether all your Ideas are not perfectly passive and inert including nothing of Action in them  Hyl  They are  Phil  And are sensible Qualities any thing else but Ideas  Hyl  How often have I acknowledged that they are not  Phil  But is not Motion a sensible Quality  Hyl  It is  Phil  Consequently it is no Action  Hyl  I agree with you And indeed it is very plain that when I stir my Finger it remains  passive but my Will which produced the Motion is active  Phil  Now I desire to know in the first place whether Motion being allowed to be no Action you can conceive any Action beside Volition And in the second place whether to say something and conceive nothing be not to talk Nonsense And lastly whether having considered the Premises you do not perceive that to suppose any efficient or active Cause of our Ideas other than  Spirit  is highly absurd and unreasonable  Hyl  I give up the Point intirely But tho' Matter may not be a Cause yet what hinders its being an  Instrument  subservient to the Supreme Agent in the Production of our Ideas  Phil  An Instrument say you pray what may be the Figure Springs Wheels and Motions of that Instrument  Hyl  Those I pretend to determine nothing of both the Substance and its Qualities being intirely unknown to me  Phil  What You are then of Opinion it is made up of unknown Parts that it hath unknown Motions and an unknown Shape  Hyl  I do not believe it hath any Figure or Motion at all being already convinced that no sensible Qualities can exist in an unperceiving Substance  Phil  But what Notion is it possible to frame of an Instrument void of all sensible Qualities even Extension itself  Hyl  I do not pretend to have any Notion of it  Phil  And what reason have you to think this unknown this inconceivable Somewhat does exist Is it that you imagine God cannot act as well without it or that you find by Experience the Use of some such thing when you form Ideas in your own Mind  Hyl  You are always teizing me for Reasons of my Belief Pray what Reasons have you not to believe it  Phil  It is to me a sufficient Reason not to believe the Existence of any thing if I see no Reason for believing it But not to insist on Reasons for believing you will not so much as let me know what it is you wou'd have me believe since you say you have no manner of Notion of it After all let me intreat you to consider whether it be like a Philosopher or even like a Man of common Sense to pretend to believe you know not what and you know not why  Hyl  Hold  Philonous  When I tell you Matter is an  Instrument  I do not mean altogether Nothing It is true I know not the particular Kind of Instrument but however  I have some Notion of  Instrument in general  which I apply to it  Phil  But what if it shou'd prove that there is something even in the most general Notion of  Instrument  as taken in a distinct Sense from  Cause  which makes the Use of it inconsistent with the Divine Attributes  Hyl  Make that appear and I shall give up the Point  Phil  What mean you by the general Nature or Notion of  Instrument  Hyl  That which is common to all particular Instruments composeth the general Notion  Phil  Is it not common to all Instruments that they are applied to the doing those things only which cannot be performed by the meer Act of our Wills Thus for instance I never use an Instrument to move my Finger because it is done by a Volition But I shou'd use one if I were to remove part of a Rock or tear up a Tree by the Roots Are you of the same Mind or can you shew any Example where an Instrument is made use of in producing an Effect immediately depending on the Will of the Agent  Hyl  I own I cannot  Phil  How therefore can you suppose that an Allperfect Spirit on whose Will all things have an absolute and immediate Dependence shou'd need an Instrument in his  Operations or not needing it make use of it Thus it seems to me that you are obliged to own the Use of a lifeless inactive Instrument to be incompatible with the Infinite Perfection of God that is by your own Confession to give up the Point  Hyl  It does not readily occur what I can answer you  Phil  But methinks you shou'd be ready to own the Truth when it has been fairly proved to you We indeed who are Beings of Finite Powers are forced to make use of Instruments And the Use of an Instrument sheweth the Agent to be limited by Rules of another's Prescription and that he cannot obtain his End but in such a Way and by such Conditions Whence it seems a clear Consequence that the supreme unlimited Agent useth no Tool or Instrument at all The Will of an Omnipotent Spirit is no sooner exerted than executed without the Application of Means which if they are imployed by inferior Agents it is not upon account of any real Efficacy that is in them or necessary Aptitude to produce any Effect but meerly in compliance with the Laws of Nature or those Conditions prescribed to them by the first Cause who is Himself above all Limitation or Prescription whatsoever  Hyl  I will no longer maintain that Matter is an Instrument However I wou'd not be understood to give up its Existence neither since notwithstanding what hath been said it may still be an  Occasion  Phil  How many Shapes is your Matter to take or how often must it be proved not to exist before you are content to part with it But to say no more of this tho by all the Laws of Disputation I may justly blame you for so frequently changing the Signification of the principal Term I wou'd fain know what you mean by affirming that Matter is an Occasion having already denied it to be a Cause And when you have shewn in what Sense you understand  Occasion  pray in the next place be pleased to shew me what Reason induceth you to believe there is such an Occasion of our Ideas  Hyl  As to the first Point By  Occasion  I mean an inactive unthinking Being at the Presence whereof God excites Ideas in our Minds  Phil  And what may be the Nature of that inactive unthinking Being  Hyl  I know nothing of its Nature  Phil  Proceed then to the second Point and assign some Reason why we should allow an Existence to this inactive unthinking unknown thing  Hyl  When we see Ideas produced in our Minds after an orderly and constant Manner it is natural to think they have some fixed and regular Occasions at the Presence of which they are excited  Phil  You acknowlege then God alone to be the Cause of our Ideas and that he causes them at the Presence of those Occasions  Hyl  That is my Opinion  Phil  Those Things which you say are present to God without doubt He perceives  Hyl  Certainly otherwise they could not be to Him an Occasion of acting  Phil  Not to insist now on your making Sense of this Hypothesis or answering all the puzzling Questions and Difficulties it is liable to I only ask whether the Order and Regularity observable in the Series of our Ideas or the Course of Nature be not sufficiently accounted for by the Wisdom and Power of God and whether it does not derogate from those Attributes to suppose He is influenced directed or put in Mind when and what He is to act by any unthinking Substance And lastly whether in case I granted all you contend for it wou'd make any thing to your Purpose it not being easy to conceive how the external or absolute Existence of an unthinking Substance distinct from its being perceived can be inferred from my allowing that there are certain things perceived  by the Mind of God which are to Him the Occasion of producing Ideas in us  Hyl  I am perfectly at a Loss what to think this Notion of  Occasion  seeming now altogether as groundless as the rest  Phil  Do you not at length perceive that in all these different Acceptations of  Matter  you have been only supposing you know not what for no manner of Reason and to no kind of Use  Hyl  I freely own myself less fond of my Notions since they have been so accurately examined But still methinks I have some confused Perception that there is such a thing as  Matter  Phil  Either you perceive the Being of Matter immediately or mediately If immediately pray inform me by which of the Senses you perceive it If mediately let me know by what Reasoning it is inferred from those Things which you perceive immediately So much for the Perception Then for the Matter itself I ask whether it is Object  Substratum  Cause Instrument or Occasion You have already pleaded for each of these shifting your Notions and making Matter to appear sometime in one Shape then in another And what you have offered has been disapproved and rejected by yourself If you have any thing new to advance I wou'd gladly hear it  Hyl  I think I have already offered all I had to say on those Heads I am at a Loss what more to urge  Phil  And yet you are loath to part with your old Prejudice But to make you quit it more easily I desire that beside what has been hitherto suggested you will farther consider whether upon Supposition that Matter exists you can possibly conceive how you shou'd be affected by it Or supposing it did not exist whether it be not evident you might for all that be affected with the same Ideas you now are and consequently have the very same Reasons to believe its Existence that you now can have  Hyl  I acknowlege it is possible we might perceive all things just as we do now tho there was no Matter in the World neither can I conceive if there be Matter how it shou'd produce any Idea in our Minds And I do farther grant you have intirely satisfied me that it is impossible there shou'd be such a thing as Matter in any of the foregoing Acceptations But still I cannot help supposing that there is  Matter  in some Sense or other What that is I do not indeed pretend to determine  Phil  I do not expect you shou'd define exactly the Nature of that unknown Being Only be pleased to tell me whether it is a Substance And if so whether you can suppose  a Substance without Accidents or in case you suppose it to have Accidents or Qualities I desire you will let me know what those Qualities are at least what is meant by Matter's supporting them  Hyl  We have already argued on those Points I have no more to say to them But to prevent any farther Questions let me tell you I at present understand by  Matter  neither Substance nor Accident thinking nor extended Being neither Cause Instrument nor Occasion but something intirely unknown distinct from all these  Phil  It seems then you include in your present Notion of Matter nothing but the general Abstract Idea of  Entity  Hyl  Nothing else save only that I superadd to this general Idea the Negation of all those particular Things Qualities or Ideas that I perceive imagine or in any wise apprehend  Phil  Pray where do you suppose this unknown Matter to exist  Hyl  Oh  Philonous  now you think you have entangled me for if I say it exists in Place then you will inferr that it exists in the Mind since it is agreed that Place or Extension exists only in the Mind But I am not ashamed to own my Ignorance I know not where it exists only I am sure it exists not in Place There is a negative Answer for  you And you must expect no other to all the Questions you put for the future about Matter  Phil  Since you will not tell me where it exists be pleased to inform me after what Manner you suppose it to exist or what you mean by its  Existence  Hyl  It neither thinks nor acts neither perceives nor is perceived  Phil  But what is there positive in your abstracted Notion of its Existence  Hyl  Upon a nice Observation I do not find I have any positive Notion or Meaning at all I tell you again I am not ashamed to own my Ignorance I know not what is meant by its  Existence  or how it exists  Phil  Continue good  Hylas  to act the same ingenuous Part and tell me sincerely whether you can frame a distinct Idea of Entity in general prescinded from and exclusive of all thinking and corporeal Beings all particular things whatsoever  Hyl  Hold let me think a littleI profess  Philonous  I do not find that I can At first Glance methought I had some dilute and airy Notion of pure Entity in Abstract but upon closer Attention it has quite vanished out of Sight The more I think on it the more am I confirmed in my prudent Resolution of giving none but negative Answers and not pretending to the least Degree of any  positive Knowlege or Conception of Matter its  Where  its  How  its  Entity  or any thing belonging to it  Phil  When therefore you speak of the Existence of Matter you have not any Notion in your Mind  Hyl  None at all  Phil  Pray tell me if the Case stands not thus At first from a Belief of Material Substance you would have it that the immediate Objects existed without the Mind then that their Archetypes then Causes next Instruments then Occasions Lastly  something in general  which being interpreted proves  nothing  So Matter comes to nothing What think you  Hylas  is not this a fair Summary of your whole Proceeding  Hyl  Be that as it will yet I still insist upon it that our not being able to conceive a Thing is no Argument against its Existence  Phil  That from a Cause Effect Operation Sign or other Circumstance there may reasonably be inferred the Existence of a Thing not immediately perceived and that it were absurd for any Man to argue against the Existence of that Thing from his having no direct and positive Notion of it I freely own But where there is nothing of all this where neither Reason nor Revelation induceth us to believe the Existence of a Thing where  we have not even a relative Notion of it where an Abstraction is made from perceiving and being perceived from Spirit and Idea In fine where there is not so much as the most inadequate or faint Idea pretended to I will not indeed thence conclude against the Reality of any Notion or Existence of any thing But my Inference shall be that you mean nothing at all That you employ Words to no manner of Purpose without any Design or Signification whatsoever And I leave it to you to consider how meer Jargon shou'd be treated  Hyl  To deal frankly with you  Philonous  your Arguments seem in themselves unanswerable but they have not so great an Effect on me as to produce that intire Conviction that hearty Acquiescence which attends Demonstration I find myself still relapsing into an obscure Surmise of I know not what  Matter  Phil  But are you not sensible  Hylas  that two Things must concur to take away all Scruple and work a plenary Assent in the Mind Let a visible Object be set in never so clear a Light yet if there is any Imperfection in the Sight or if the Eye is not directed towards it it will not be distinctly seen And tho a Demonstration be never so well grounded and fairly proposed yet if there is withal a Stain of Prejudice or a  wrong Biass on the Understanding can it be expected on a suddain to perceive clearly and adhere firmly to the Truth No there is need of Time and Pains The Attention must be awakened and detained by a frequent Repetition of the same Thing placed oft in the same oft in different Lights I have said it already and find I must still repeat and inculcate that it is an unaccountable Licence you take in pretending to maintain you know not what for you know not what Reason to you know not what Purpose Can this be paralleled in any Art or Science any Sect or Profession of Men Or is there any thing so barefacedly groundless and unreasonable to be met with even in the lowest of common Conversation But perhaps you will still say Matter may exist tho' at the same time you neither know what is meant by  Matter  or by its  Existence  This indeed is surprizing and the more so because it is altogether voluntary and of your own Head you not being led to it by any one Reason for I challenge you to shew me that Thing in Nature which needs Matter to explain or account for it  Hyl  The Reality of Things cannot be maintained without supposing the Existence of Matter And is not this think you a good Reason why I shou'd be earnest in its Defence  Phil  The Reality of Things What Things sensible or intelligible  Hyl  Sensible Things  Phil  My Glove for Example  Hyl  That or any other thing perceived by the Senses  Phil  But to fix on some particular thing is it not a sufficient Evidence to me of the Existence of this  Glove  that I see it and feel it and wear it Or if this will not do how is it possible I shou'd be assured of the Reality of this Thing which I actually see in this Place by supposing that some unknown Thing which I never did or can see exists after an unknown manner in an unknown place or in no place at all How can the supposed Reality of that which is intangible be a Proof that any thing tangible really exists or of that which is invisible that any visible thing or in general of any thing which is imperceptible that a Perceptible exists Do but explain this and I shall think nothing too hard for you  Hyl  Upon the whole I am content to own the Existence of Matter is highly improbable but the direct and absolute Impossibility of it does not appear to me  Phil  But granting Matter to be possible yet upon that account meerly it can have no more Claim to Existence than a Golden Mountain or a Centaur  Hyl  I acknowlege it but still you do not deny it is possible and that which is possible for ought you know may actually exist  Phil  I deny it to be possible And have if I mistake not evidently proved from your own Concessions that it is not In the common Sense of the Word  Matter  is there any more implied than an extended solid figured moveable Substance existing without the Mind And have not you acknowleged over and over that you have seen evident Reason for denying the Possibility of such a Substance  Hyl  Ay but that is only one Sense of the Term  Matter  Phil  But is it not the only proper genuine received Sense And if Matter in such a Sense be proved impossible may it not be thought with good Grounds absolutely impossible Else how cou'd any thing be proved impossible Or indeed how cou'd there be any Proof at all one way or other to a Man who takes the Liberty to unsettle and change the common Signification of Words  Hyl  I thought Philosophers might be allowed to speak more accurately than the Vulgar and were not always confined to the common Acceptation of a Term  Phil  But this now mentioned is the common received Sense among Philosophers themselves But not to insist on that have you not been allowed to take Matter in what Sense you pleased And have you not used this Privilege in the utmost Extent sometimes intirely changing at others leaving out or putting into the Definition of it whatever for the present best served your Design contrary to all the known Rules of Reason and Logic And hath not this shifting unfair Method of yours spun out our Dispute to an unnecessary Length Matter having been particularly examined and by your own Confession refuted in each of those Senses And can any more be required to prove the absolute Impossibility of a Thing than the proving it impossible in every particular Sense that either you or any one else understands it in  Hyl  But I am not so thorowly satisfied that you have proved the Impossibility of Matter in the last most obscure abstracted and indefinite Sense  Phil  When is a thing shewn to be impossible  Hyl  When a Repugnancy is demonstrated between the Ideas comprehended in its Definition  Phil  But where there are no Ideas there no Repugnancy can be demonstrated between Ideas  Hyl  I agree with you  Phil  Now in that which you call the obscure indefinite Sense of the Word  Matter  it is plain by your own Confession there was included no Idea at all no Sense except an unknown Sense which is the same thing as none You are not therefore to expect I shou'd prove a Repugnancy between Ideas where there are no Ideas or the Impossibility of Matter taken in an  unknown  Sense  i e  no Sense at all My business was only to shew you meant  nothing  and this you were brought to own So that in all your various Senses you have been shew'd either to mean nothing at all or if any thing an Absurdity And if this be not suffient to prove the Impossibility of a Thing I desire you will let me know what is  Hyl  I acknowledge you have proved that Matter is impossible nor do I see what more can be said in defence of it But at the same time that I give up this I fuspect all my other Notions For surely none cou'd be more seemingly evident than this once was And yet it now seems as false and absurd as ever it did true before But I think we have discussed the Point sufficiently for the present The remaining Part of the Day I  wou'd willingly spend in running over in my Thoughts the several Heads of this Morning's Conversation and to Morrow shall shall be glad to meet you here again about the same time  Phil  I will not fail to attend you  The Third DIALOGUE  Philonous  _SO  Hylas  What are the Fruits of Yesterday's Meditation Has it confirmed you in the same Mind you were in at parting or have you since seen Cause to change your Opinion  Hylas  Truly my Opinion is that all our Opinions are alike vain and uncertain What we approve to Day we condemn to Morrow We keep a Stir about Knowlege and spend our Lives in the Pursuit of it when alas we know nothing all the while nor do I think it possible for us ever to know any thing in this Life Our Faculties are too narrow and too few Nature certainly never intended us for Speculation  Phil  What say you we can know nothing  Hylas  Hyl  There is not that single thing in the World whereof we can know the real Nature or what it is in itself  Phil  Will you tell me I do not really know what Fire or Water is  Hyl  You may indeed know that Fire appears hot and Water fluid But this is no more than knowing what Sensations are produced in your own Mind upon the Application of Fire and Water to your Organs of Sense Their internal Constitution their true and real Nature you are utterly in the dark as to  that  Phil  Do I not know this to be a real Stone that I stand on and that which I see before my Eyes to be a real Tree  Hyl  Know  no it is impossible you or any Man alive shou'd know it All you know is that you have such a certain Idea or Appearance in your own Mind But what is this to the real Tree or Stone I tell you that Colour Figure and Hardness which you perceive are not at all the real Natures of those Things or in the least like them The same may be said of all other real Things or corporeal Substances which compose the World They have none of them any thing in themselves like those sensible Qualities by us perceived We shou'd not therefore pretend to affirm or know any  thing of them as they are in their own Nature  Phil  But surely  Hylas  I can distinguish Gold for Example from Iron And how could this be if I knew not what either truly was  Hyl  Believe me  Philonous  you can only distinguish between your own Ideas That Yellowness that Weight and other sensible Qualities think you they are really in the Gold They are only relative to the Senses and have no absolute Existence in Nature And in pretending to distinguish the Species of real Things by the Appearances in your Mind you may perhaps act as wisely as he that shou'd conclude two Men were of a different Species because their Cloaths were not of the same Colour  Phil  It seems then we are altogether put off with the Appearances of Things and those false ones too The very Meat I eat and the Cloth I wear have nothing in them like what I see and feel  Hyl  Even so  Phil  But is it not strange the whole World shou'd be thus imposed on and so foolish as to believe their Senses And yet I know not how it is but Men eat and drink and sleep and perform all the Offices of Life as comfortably and conveniently as if they  really knew the Things they are conversant about  Hyl  They do so But you know ordinary Practice does not require a Nicety of speculative Knowlege Hence the Vulgar retain their Mistakes and for all that make a Shift to bustle thorow the Affairs of Life But Philosophers know better things  Phil  You mean they know that they  know nothing  Hyl  That is the very Top and Perfection of Humane Knowlege  Phil  But are you all this while in earnest  Hylas  and are you seriously persuaded that you know nothing real in the World Suppose you were going to write wou'd you not call for Pen Ink and Paper like another Man and do you not know what it is you call for  Hyl  How often must I tell you that I know not the real Nature of any one thing in the Universe I may indeed upon Occasion make use of Pen Ink and Paper But what any one of them is in its own true Nature I declare positively I know not And the same is true with regard to every other corporeal thing And what is more we are not only ignorant of the true and real Nature of Things but even of their Existence It cannot be denied that we perceive such certain Appearances or Ideas but it cannot be concluded  from thence that Bodies really exist Nay now I think on it I must agreeably to my former Concessions farther declare that it is impossible any real corporeal Thing shou'd exist in Nature  Phil  You amaze me Was ever any thing more wild and extravagant than the Notions you now maintain And is it not evident you are led into all these Extravagancies by the Belief of  material Substance  This makes you dream of those unknown Natures in every thing It is this occasions your distinguishing between the Reality and sensible Appearances of Things It is to this you are indebted for being ignorant of what every Body else knows perfectly well Nor is this all You are not only ignorant of the true Nature of every Thing but you know not whether any thing really exists or whether there are any true Natures at all forasmuch as you attribute to your material Beings an absolute or external Existence wherein you suppose their Reality consists And as you are forced in the end to acknowlege such an Existence means either a direct Repugnancy or nothing at all it follows that you are obliged to pull down your own Hypothesis of material Substance and positively to deny the real Existence of any Part of the Universe And so you are plunged into the deepest and most deplorable  Scepticism  that ever Man was Tell me  Hylas  is it not as I say  Hyl  I agree with you  Material Substance  was no more than an Hypothesis and a false and groundless one too I will no longer spend my Breath in Defence of it But whatever Hypothesis you advance or whatsoever Scheme of Things you introduce in its stead I doubt not it will appear every whit as false Let me but be allowed to question you upon it That is suffer me to serve you in your own Kind and I warrant it shall conduct you thorow as many Perplexities and Contradictions to the very same State of Scepticism that I myself am in at present  Phil  I assure you  Hylas  I do not pretend to frame any Hypothesis at all I am of a vulgar Cast simple enough to believe my Senses and leave Things as I find them To be plain it is my Opinion that the real Things are those very Things I see and feel and perceive by my Senses These I know and finding they answer all the Necessities and Purposes of Life have no reason to be solicitous about any other unknown Beings A Piece of sensible Bread for Instance wou'd stay my Stomach better than ten thousand times as much of that insensible unintelligible real Bread you speak of It is likewise my Opinion that Colours and other sensible Qualities are on the Objects I cannot for  my Life help thinking that Snow is white and Fire hot You indeed who by  Snow  and  Fire  mean certain external unperceived unperceiving Substances are in the right to deny Whiteness or Heat to be Affections inherent in them But I who understand by those Words the Things I see and feel am obliged to think like other Folks And as I am no Sceptic with regard to the Nature of Things so neither am I as to their Existence That a thing shou'd be really perceived by my Senses and at the same time not really exist is to me a plain Contradiction since I cannot prescind or abstract even in Thought the Existence of a sensible Thing from its being perceived Wood Stones Fire Water Flesh Iron and the like Things which I name and discourse of are Things that I know otherwise I shou'd never have thought of them or named them And I shou'd not have known them but that I perceived them by my Senses and Things perceived by the Senses are immediately perceived and Things immmediately perceived are Ideas and Ideas cannot exist without the Mind their Existence therefore consists in being perceived when therefore they are actually perceived there can be no Doubt of their Existence Away then with all that Scepticism all those ridiculous Philosophical Doubts What a Jest is it for a Philosopher to question  the Existence of sensible Things till he has it proved to him from the Veracity of God Or to pretend our Knowlege in this Point falls short of Intuition or Demonstration I might as well doubt of my own Being as of the Being of those Things I actually see and feel  Hyl  Not so fast  Philonous  you say you cannot conceive how sensible Things shou'd exist without the Mind Do you not  Phil  I do  Hyl  Supposing you were annihilated cannot you conceive it possible that Things perceivable by Sense may still exist  Phil  I can but then it must be in another mind When I deny sensible Things an Existence out of the Mind I do not mean my Mind in particular but all Minds Now it is plain they have an Existence exterior to my Mind since I find them by Experience to be independent of it There is therefore some other Mind wherein they exist during the Intervals between the Times of my perceiving them As likewise they did before my Birth and wou'd do after my supposed Annihilation And as the same is true with regard to all other finite created Spirits it necessarily follows there is an  Omnipresent Eternal Mind  which knows and comprehends all things and exhibits them to our View in such a manner and according  to such Rules as He Himself has ordained and are by us termed the  Laws of Nature  Hyl  Answer me  Philonous  Are all our Ideas perfectly inert Beings or have they any Agency included in them  Phil  They are altogether passive and inert  Hyl  And is not God an Agent a Being purely active  Phil  I acknowlege it  Hyl  No Idea therefore can be like unto or represent the Nature of God  Phil  It cannot  Hyl  Since therefore you have no Idea of the Mind of God how can you conceive it possible that things shou'd exist in His Mind Or if you can conceive the Mind of God without having an Idea of it why may not I be allowed to conceive the Existence of Matter notwithstanding that I have no Idea of it  Phil  As to your first Question I own I have properly no Idea either of God or any other Spirit for these being active cannot be represented by things perfectly inert as our Ideas are I do nevertheless know that I who am a Spirit or thinking Substance exist as certainly as I know my Ideas exist Farther I know what I mean by the Terms  I  and  Myself  and I know this immediately or intuitively tho I do not perceive it as I perceive a Triangle a Colour or a Sound The Mind Spirit or Soul is that indivisible unextended  Thing which thinks acts and perceives I say  indivisible  because unextended and  unextended  because extended figured moveable Things are Ideas and that which perceives Ideas which thinks and wills is plainly itself no Idea nor like an Idea Ideas are Things inactive and perceived And Spirits a sort of Beings altogether different from them I do not therefore say my Soul is an Idea or like an Idea However taking the Word  Idea  in a large Sense my Soul may be said to furnish me with an Idea that is an Image or Likeness of God tho indeed extremely inadequate For all the Notion I have of God is obtained by reflecting on my own Soul heightning its Powers and removing its Imperfections I have therefore tho not an inactive Idea yet in myself some sort of an active thinking Image of the Deity And tho I perceive Him not by Sense yet I have a Notion of Him or know Him by Reflexion and Reasoning My own Mind and my own Ideas I have an immediate Knowlege of and by the Help of these do mediately apprehend the Possibility of the Existence of other Spirits and Ideas Farther from my own Being and from the Dependency I find in myself and my Ideas I do by an Act of Reason necessarily infer the Existence of a God and of all created Things in the Mind of  God So much for your first Question For the second I suppose by this time you can answer it yourself For you neither perceive Matter objectively as you do an inactive Being or Idea nor know it as you do yourself by a reflex Act Neither do you mediately apprehend it by Similitude of the one or the other Nor yet collect it by Reasoning from that which you know immediately All which makes the Case of  Matter  widely different from that of the  Deity  Hyl  I own myself satisfied in this Point But do you in earnest think the real Existence of sensible Things consists in their being actually perceived If so How comes it that all Mankind distinguish between them Ask the first Man you meet and he shall tell you  to be perceived  is one thing and  to exist  is another  Phil  I am content  Hylas  to appeal to the common Sense of the World for the Truth of my Notion Ask the Gardiner why he thinks yonder CherryTree exists in the Garden and he shall tell you because he sees and feels it in a word because he perceives it by his Senses Ask him why he thinks an OrangeTree not to be there and he shall tell you because he does not perceive it What he perceives by Sense that he terms a real Being and saith it  is  or  exists  but that  which is not perceivable the same he saith has no Being  Hyl  Yes  Philonous  I grant the Existence of a sensible Thing consists in being perceivable but not in being actually perceived  Phil  And what is perceivable but an Idea And can an Idea exist without being actually perceived These are Points long since agreed between us  Hyl  But be your Opinion never so true Yet surely you will not deny it is shocking and contrary to the common Sense of Men Ask the Fellow whether yonder Tree has an Existence out of his Mind What Answer think you he wou'd make  Phil  The same that I shou'd myself  viz  That it does exist out of his Mind But then to a Christian it cannot surely be shocking to say The real Tree existing without his Mind is truly known and comprehended by that is  exists in  the infinite Mind of God Probably he may not at first Glance be aware of the direct and immediate Proof there is of this inasmuch as the very Being of a Tree or any other sensible Thing implies a Mind wherein it is But the Point itself he cannot deny The Question between the Materialists and me is not whether Things have a real Existence out of the Mind of this or that Person but whether they have an absolute Existence distinct from being perceived  by God and exterior to all Minds This indeed some Heathens and Philosophers have affirmed but whoever entertains Notions of the Deity suitable to the Holy Scriptures will be of another Opinion  Hyl  But according to your Notions what Difference is there between real Things and Chimeras formed by the Imagination or the Visions of a Dream since they are all equally in the Mind  Phil  The Ideas formed by the Imagination are faint and indistinct they have besides an intire Dependence on the Will But the Ideas perceived by Sense  i e  real Things are more vivid and clear and being imprinted on the Mind by a Spirit distinct from us have not a like Dependence on our Will There is therefore no Danger of confounding these with the foregoing And there is as little of confounding them with the Visions of a Dream which are dim irregular and confused And tho they shou'd happen to be never so lively and natural yet by their not being connected and of a Piece with the preceding and subsequent Transactions of our Lives they might easily be distinguished from Realities In short by whatever Method you distinguish  Things  from  Chimeras  on your own Scheme the same it is evident will hold also upon mine For it must be I presume by some perceived Difference and  I am not for depriving you of any one thing that you perceive  Hyl  But still  Philonous  you hold there is nothing in the World but Spirits and Ideas And this you must needs acknowlege sounds very odly  Phil  I own the Word  Idea  not being commonly used for  Thing  sounds something out of the way My Reason for using it was because a necessary Relation to the Mind is understood to be implied by that Term and it is now commonly used by Philosophers to denote the immediate Objects of the Understanding But however odly the Proposition may sound in Words yet it includes nothing so very strange or shocking in its Sense which in effect amounts to no more than this  viz  that there are only Things perceiving and Things perceived or that every unthinking Being is necessarily and from the very Nature of its Existence perceived by some Mind if not by any finite created Mind yet certainly by the infinite Mind of God in whom  we live and move and have our Being  Is this as strange as to say The sensible Qualities are not on the Objects Or That we cannot be sure of the Existence of Things or know any thing of their real Natures tho we both see and feel them and perceive them by all our Senses  Hyl  And in Consequence of this must we not think there are no such Things as Physical or Corporeal Causes But that a Spirit is the immediate Cause of all the  Phaenomena  in Nature Can there be any thing more extravagant than this  Phil  Yes it is infinitely more extravagant to say A thing which is inert operates on the Mind and which is unperceiving is the Cause of our Perceptions without any regard either to Consistency or the old known Axiom  Nothing can give to another that which it hath not itself  Besides that which to you I know not for what Reason seems so extravagant is no more than the Holy Scriptures assert in a hundred Places In them God is represented as the sole and immediate Author of all those Effects which some Heathens and Philosophers are wont to ascribe to Nature Matter Fate or the like unthinking Principle This is so much the constant Language of Scripture that it were needless to confirm it by Citations  Hyl  You are not aware  Philonous  that in making God the immediate Author of all the Motions in Nature you make him the Author of Murder Sacrilege Adultery and the like heinous Sins  Phil  In Answer to that I observe first that the Imputation of Guilt is the same whether a Person commits an Action with or without  an Instrument In case therefore you suppose God to act by the Mediation of an Instrument or Occasion called  Matter  you as truly make Him the Author of Sin as I who think Him the immediate Agent in all those Operations vulgarly ascribed to Nature I farther observe that Sin or moral Turpitude does not consist in the outward Physical Action or Motion but in the internal Deviation of the Will from the Laws of Reason and Religion This is plain in that the killing an Enemy in a Battel or putting a Criminal legally to Death is not thought sinful tho the outward Act be the very same with that in the Case of Murder Since therefore Sin does not consist in the Physical Action the making God an immediate Cause of all such Actions is not making Him the Author of Sin Lastly I have no where said that God is the only Agent who produces all the Motions in Bodies It is true I have denied there are any other Agents beside Spirits But this is very consistent with allowing to Thinking Rational Beings in the Production of Motions the Use of limited Powers ultimately indeed derived from God but immediately under the Direction of their own Wills which is sufficient to intitle them to all the Guilt of their Actions  Hyl  But the denying Matter  Philonous  or corporeal Substance there is the Point  You can never persuade me that this is not repugnant to the universal Sense of Mankind Were our Dispute to be determined by most Voices I am confident you wou'd give up the Point without gathering the Votes  Phil  I wish both our Opinions were fairly stated and submitted to the Judgment of Men who had plain common Sense without the Prejudices of a learned Education Let me be represented as one who trusts his Senses who thinks he knows the Things he sees and feels and entertains no Doubts of their Existence and you fairly set forth with all your Doubts your Paradoxes and your Scepticism about you and I shall willingly acquiesce in the Determination of any indifferent Person That there is no Substance wherein Ideas can exist beside Spirit is to me evident And that the Objects immediately perceived are Ideas is on all Hands agreed And that sensible Qualities are Objects immediately perceived no one can deny It is therefore evident there can be no  Substratum  of those Qualities but Spirit in which they exist not by way of Mode or Property but as a thing perceived in that which perceives it I deny therefore that there is any unthinking  Substratum  of the Objects of Sense and in that Acceptation that there is any material Substance But if by  material Substance  is meant only sensible Body that which  is seen and felt and the unphilosophical Part of the World I dare say mean no more then I am more certain of Matter's Existence than you or any other Philosopher pretend to be If there be any thing which makes the Generality of Mankind averse from the Notions I espouse It is a Misapprehension that I deny the Reality of sensible Things But as it is you who are guilty of that and not I it follows that in truth their Aversion is against your Notions and not mine I do therefore assert that I am as certain as of my own Being that there are Bodies or corporeal Substances meaning the Things I perceive by my Senses and that granting this the Bulk of Mankind will take no Thought about nor think themselves at all concerned in the Fate of those unknown Natures and Philosophical Quiddities which some Men are so fond of  Hyl  What say you to this Since according to you Men must judge of the Reality of Things by their Senses how can a Man be mistaken in thinking the Moon a plain lucid Surface about a Foot in Diameter or a square Tower seen at a distance round or an Oar with one End in the Water crooked  Phil  He is not mistaken with regard to the Ideas he actually perceives but in the Inferences he makes from his present Perceptions  Thus in the Case of the Oar what he immediately perceives by Sight is certainly crooked and so far he is in the right But if he thence conclude that upon taking the Oar out of the Water he shall perceive the same Crookedness or that it wou'd affect his Touch as crooked things are wont to do In that he is mistaken In like manner if he shall conclude from what he perceives in one Station that in case he advanced toward the Moon or Tower he shou'd still be affected with the like Ideas he is mistaken But his Mistake lies not in what he perceives immediately and at present it being a manifest Contradiction to suppose he shou'd err in respect of that but in the wrong Judgment he makes concerning the Ideas he apprehends to be connected with those immediately perceived Or concerning the Ideas that from what he perceives at present he imagines wou'd be perceived in other Circumstances The Case is the same with regard to the  Copernican  System We do not here perceive any Motion of the Earth But it were erroneous thence to conclude that in case we were placed at as great a Distance from that as we are now from the other Planets we shou'd not then perceive its Motion  Hyl  I understand you and must needs own you say things plausible enough But  give me leave to put you in mind of one thing Pray  Philonous  were you not formerly as positive that Matter existed as you are now that it does not  Phil  I was But here lies the Difference Before my Positiveness was founded without Examination upon Prejudice but now after Inquiry upon Evidence  Hyl  After all it seems our Dispute is rather about Words than Things We agree in the Thing but differ in the Name That we are affected with Ideas from without is evident and it is no less evident that there must be I will not say Archetypes but Powers without the Mind corresponding to those Ideas And as these Powers cannot subsist by themselves there is some Subject of them necessarily to be admitted which I call  Matter  and you call  Spirit  There is all the Difference  Phil  Pray  Hylas  is that powerful Being or Subject of Powers extended  Hyl  It hath not Extension but it has the Power to raise in you the Idea of Extension  Phil  It is therefore itself unextended  Hyl  I grant it  Phil  Is it not also active  Hyl  Without doubt Otherwise how cou'd we attribute Powers to it  Phil  Now let me ask you Two Questions  First  Whether it be agreeable to the Usage either of Philosophers or others to give the Name  Matter  to an unextended active Being And  Secondly  Whether it be not ridiculously absurd to misapply Names contrary to the common Use of Language  Hyl  Well then let it not be called Matter since you will have it so but some  Third Nature  distinct from Matter and Spirit For what reason is there why you shou'd call it Spirit does not the Notion of Spirit imply that it is thinking as well as active and unextended  Phil  My Reason is this Because I have a mind to have some Notion or Meaning in what I say but I have no Notion of any Action distinct from Volition neither can I conceive Volition to be any where but in a Spirit therefore when I speak of an active Being I am obliged to mean a Spirit Beside what can be plainer than that a thing which hath no Ideas in itself cannot impart them to me and if it hath Ideas surely it must be a Spirit To make you comprehend the Point still more clearly if it be possible I assert as well as you that since we are affected from without we must allow Powers to be without in a Being distinct from ourselves So far we are agreed But then we differ as to the Kind of this powerful Being I will have  it to be Spirit you Matter or I know not what I may add too you know not what Third Nature Thus I prove it to be Spirit From the Effects I see produced I conclude there are Actions and because Actions Volitions and because there are Volitions there must be a Will Again the Things I perceive must have an Existence they or their Archetypes out of my Mind But being Ideas neither they nor their Archetypes can exist otherwise than in an Understanding There is therefore an Understanding But Will and Understanding constitute in the strictest Sense a Mind or Spirit The powerful Cause therefore of my Ideas is in strict Propriety of Speech a  Spirit  Hyl  And now I warrant you think you have made the Point very clear little suspecting that what you advance leads directly to a Contradiction Is it not an Absurdity to imagine any Imperfection in God  Phil  Without doubt  Hyl  To suffer Pain is an Imperfection  Phil  It is  Hyl  Are we not sometimes affected with Pain and Uneasiness by some other Being  Phil  We are  Hyl  And have you not said that Being is a Spirit and is not that Spirit God  Phil  I grant it  Hyl  But you have asserted that whatever Ideas we perceive from without are in the Mind which affects us The Ideas therefore of Pain and Uneasiness are in God or in other Words God suffers Pain That is to say there is an Imperfection in the Divine Nature which you acknowleged was absurd So you are caught in a plain Contradiction  Phil  That God knows or understands all things and that He knows among other things what Pain is even every sort of painful Sensation and what it is for His Creatures to suffer Pain I make no question But that God tho' He knows and sometimes causes painful Sensations in us can Himself suffer Pain I positively deny We who are limited and dependent Spirits are liable to Impressions of Sense the Effects of an external Agent which being produced against our Wills are sometimes painful and uneasy But God whom no external Being can affect who perceives nothing by Sense as we do whose Will is absolute and independent causing all things and liable to be thwarted or resisted by nothing it is evident such a Being as this can suffer nothing nor be affected with any painful Sensation or indeed any Sensation at all We are chained to a Body that is to say our Perceptions are connected with corporeal Motions  By the Law of our Nature we are affected upon every Alteration in the nervous Parts of our sensible Body Which sensible Body rightly considered is nothing but a Complexion of such Qualities or Ideas as have no Existence distinct from being perceived by a Mind So that this Connexion of Sensations with corporeal Motions means no more than a Correspondence in the Order of Nature between two Setts of Ideas or Things immediately perceivable But God is a pure Spirit disengaged from all such Sympathy or natural Ties No corporeal Motions are attended with the Sensations of Pain or Pleasure in his Mind To know every thing knowable is certainly a Perfection but to endure or suffer or feel any thing by Sense is an Imperfection The former I say agrees to God but not the latter God knows or hath Ideas but His Ideas are not convey'd to Him by Sense as ours are Your not Distinguishing where there is so manifest a Difference makes you fancy you see an Absurdity where there is none  Hyl  But all this while you have not considered that the Quantity of Matter has been demonstrated to be proportional to the Gravity of Bodies And what can withstand Demonstration  Phil  Let me see how you demonstrate that Point  Hyl  I lay it down for a Principle that the Moments or Quantities of Motion in Bodies are in a direct compounded Reason of the Velocities and Quantities of Matter contained in them Hence where the Velocities are equal it follows the Moments are directly as the Quantity of Matter in each But it is found by Experience that all Bodies bating the small Inequalities arising from the Resistance of the Air descend with an equal Velocity the Motion therefore of descending Bodies and consequently their Gravity which is the Cause or Principle of that Motion is proportional to the Quantity of Matter which was to be demonstrated  Phil  You lay it down as a selfevident Principle that the Quantity of Motion in any Body is proportional to the Velocity and  Matter  taken together And this is made use of to prove a Proposition from whence the Existence of  Matter  is inferred Pray is not this arguing in a Circle  Hyl  In the Premise I only mean that the Motion is proportional to the Velocity jointly with the Extension and Solidity  Phil  But allowing this to be true yet it will not thence follow that Gravity is proportional to  Matter  in your Philosophic Sense  of the Word except you take it for granted that unknown  Substratum  or whatever else you call it is proportional to those sensible Qualities which to suppose is plainly begging the Question That there is Magnitude and Solidity or Resistance perceived by Sense I readily grant as likewise that Gravity may be proportional to those Qualities I will not dispute But that either these Qualities as perceived by us or the Powers producing them do exist in a  material Substratum  this is what I deny and you indeed affirm but notwithstanding your Demonstration have not yet proved  Hyl  I shall insist no longer on that Point Do you think however you shall persuade me the natural Philosophers have been dreaming all this while pray what becomes of all their Hypotheses and Explications of the  Phaenomena  which suppose the Existence of Matter  Phil  What mean you  Hylas  by the  Phaenomena  Hyl  I mean the Appearances which I perceive by my Senses  Phil  And the Appearances perceived by Sense are they not Ideas  Hyl  I have told you so a hundred times  Phil  Therefore to explain the  Phaenomena  is to shew how we come to be affected with Ideas in that Manner and Series wherein  they are imprinted on our Senses Is it not  Hyl  It is  Phil  Now if you can prove that any Philosopher has explained the Production of any one Idea in our Minds by the Help of  Matter  I shall for ever acquiesce and look on all that has been said against it as nothing But if you cannot it is in vain to urge the Explication of  Phaenomena  That a Being endowed with Knowlege and Will shou'd produce or exhibit Ideas is easily understood But that a Being which is utterly destitute of these Faculties shou'd be able to produce Ideas or in any Sort to affect an Intelligence this I can never understand This I say tho we had some positive Conception of Matter tho we knew its Qualities and cou'd comprehend its Existence wou'd yet be so far from explaining Things that it is itself the most inexplicable thing in the World And for all this it will not follow that Philosophers have been doing nothing neither for by observing and reasoning upon the Connexion of Ideas they discover the Laws and Methods of Nature which is a part of Knowlege both useful and entertaining  Hyl  After all can it be supposed God wou'd deceive all Mankind do you imagine He wou'd have induced the whole World to believe the Being of Matter if there was no such thing  Phil  That every epidemical Opinion arising from Prejudice or Passion or Thoughtlesness may be imputed to God as the Author of it I believe you will not affirm Whatsoever Opinion we father on Him it must be either because He has discovered it to us by supernatural Revelation or because it is so evident to our natural Faculties which were framed and given us by God that it is impossible we shou'd withhold our Assent from it But where is the Revelation or where is the Evidence that extorts the Belief of Matter Nay How does it appear that Matter taken for something distinct from what we perceive by our Senses is thought to exist by all Mankind or indeed by any except a few Philosophers who do not know what they wou'd be at Your Question supposes these Points are clear and when you have cleared them I shall think myself obliged to give you another Answer In the mean time let it suffice that I tell you I do not suppose God has deceived Mankind at all  Hyl  But the Novelty  Philonous  the Novelty There lies the Danger New Notions shou'd always be discountenanced they unsettle Mens Minds and no body knows where they will end  Phil  Why the Rejecting a Notion that has no Foundation either in Sense in Reason or in Divine Authority shou'd be thought to unsettle  the Belief of such Opinions as are grounded on all or any of these I cannot imagine That Innovations in Government and Religion are dangerous and ought to be discountenanced I freely own But is there the like Reason why they shou'd be discouraged in Philosophy The making any thing known which was unknown before is an Innovation in Knowledge And if all such Innovations had been forbidden Men wou'd have made a notable Progress in the Arts and Sciences But it is none of my business to plead for Novelties and Paradoxes That the Qualities we perceive are not on the Objects That we must not believe our Senses That we know nothing of the real Nature of Things and can never be assured even of their Existence That real Colours and Sounds are nothing but certain unknown Figures and Motions That Motions are in themselves neither swift nor slow That there are in Bodies absolute Extensions without any particular Magnitude or Figure That a Thing stupid thoughtless and inactive operates on a Spirit That the least Particle of a Body contains innumerable extended Parts These are the Novelties these are the strange Notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted Judgment of all Mankind and being once admitted embarrass the Mind with endless Doubts and Difficulties And it is against  these and the like Innovations I endeavor to vindicate common Sense It is true in doing this I may perhaps be obliged to use some  Ambages  and Ways of Speech not common But if my Notions are once thorowly understood that which is most singular in them will in effect be found to amount to no more than this That it is absolutely impossible and a plain Contradiction to suppose any unthinking Being shou'd exist without being perceived by a Mind And if this Notion be singular it is a shame it shou'd be so at this time of day and in a Christian Country  Hyl  As for the Difficulties other Opinions may be liable to those are out of the Question It is your Business to defend your own Opinion Can any thing be plainer than that you are for changing all things into Ideas You I say who are not ashamed to charge me with  Scepticism  This is so plain there is no denying it  Phil  You mistake me I am not for changing Things into Ideas but rather Ideas into Things since those immediate Objects of Perception which according to you are only Appearances of Things I take to be the real Things themselves  Hyl  Things you may pretend what you please but it is certain you leave us nothing  but the empty Forms of Things the Outside only which strikes the Senses  Phil  What you call the empty Forms and Outside of Things seem to me the very Things themselves Nor are they empty or incomplete otherwise than upon your Supposition that Matter is an essential Part of all corporeal Things We both therefore agree in this that we perceive only sensible Forms But herein we differ you will have them to be empty Appearances I real Beings In short you do not trust your Senses I do  Hyl  You say you believe your Senses and seem to applaud youself that in this you agree with the Vulgar According to you therefore the true Nature of a Thing is discovered by the Senses If so whence comes that Disagreement Why is not the same Figure and other sensible Qualities perceived all manner of Ways and why shou'd we use a Microscope the better to discover the true Nature of a Body if it were discoverable to the naked Eye  Phil  Strictly speaking  Hylas  we do not see the same Object that we feel neither is the same Object perceived by the Microscope which was by the naked Eye But in case every Variation was thought sufficient to constitute a new Kind or Individual the endless Number or Confusion of Names wou'd render Language impracticable Therefore  to avoid this as well as other Inconveniencies which are obvious upon a little Thought Men combine together several Ideas apprehended by divers Senses or by the same Sense at different Times or in different Circumstances but observed however to have some Connexion in Nature either with respect to Coexistence or Succession all which they refer to one Name and consider as one Thing Hence it follows that when I examine by my other Senses a Thing I have seen it is not in order to understand better the same Object which I had perceived by Sight the Object of one Sense not being perceived by the other Senses And when I look thro a Microscope it is not that I may perceive more clearly what I perceived already with my bare Eyes the Object perceived by the Glass being quite different from the former But in both cases my Aim is only to know what Ideas are connected together and the more a Man knows of the Connexion of Ideas the more he is said to know of the Nature of Things What therefore if our Ideas are variable what if our Senses are not in all Circumstances affected with the same Appearances It will not thence follow they are not to be trusted or that they are inconsistent either with themselves or any thing else except it be with your preconceived Notion of I know not what one single unchanged unperceivable real Nature marked  by each Name Which Prejudice seems to have taken its Rise from not rightly understanding the common Language of Men speaking of several distinct Ideas as united into one thing by the Mind And indeed there is Cause to suspect several erroneous Conceits of the Philosophers are owing to the same Original While they began to build their Schemes not so much on Notions as Words which were framed by the Vulgar meerly for Conveniency and Dispatch in the common Actions of Life without any regard to Speculation  Hyl  Methinks I apprehend your Meaning  Phil  It is your Opinion the Ideas we perceive by our Senses are not real Things but Images or Copies of them Our Knowlege therefore is no farther real than as our Ideas are the true Representations of those Originals But as these supposed Originals are in themselves unknown it is impossible to know how far our Ideas resemble them or whether they resemble them at all We cannot therefore be sure we have any real Knowlege Farther as our Ideas are perpetually varied without any Change in the supposed real Things it necessarily follows they cannot all be true Copies of them Or if some are and others are not it is impossible to distinguish the former from the latter  And this plunges us yet deeper in Uncertainty Again when we consider the Point we cannot conceive how any Idea or any thing like an Idea shou'd have an absolute Existence out of a Mind Nor consequently according to you how there shou'd be any real Thing in Nature The Result of all which is that we are thrown into the most hopeless and abandoned  Scepticism  Now give me leave to ask you  First  Whether your referring Ideas to certain absolutely existing unperceived Substances as their Originals be not the Source of all this  Scepticism Secondly  Whether you are informed either by Sense or Reason of the Existence of those unknown Originals And in case you are not Whether it be not absurd to suppose them  Thirdly  Whether upon Inquiry you find there is any thing distinctly conceived or meant by the  absolute or external Existence of unperceiving Substances Lastly  Whether the Premises considered it be not the wisest way to follow Nature trust your Senses and laying aside all anxious Thought about unknown Natures or Substances admit with the Vulgar those for real Things which are perceived by the Senses  Hyl  For the present I have no Inclination to the Answering Part I wou'd much rather see how you can get over what follows Pray are not the Objects perceived by the  Senses of one likewise perceivable to all others present If there were an hundred more here they wou'd all see the Garden the Trees and Flowers as I see them But they are not in the same manner affected with the Ideas I frame in my Imagination Does not this make a Difference between the former sort of Objects and the latter  Phil  I grant it does Nor have I ever denied a Difference between the Objects of Sense and those of Imagination But what wou'd you infer from thence You cannot say that sensible Objects exist unperceived because they are perceived by many  Hyl  I own I can make nothing of that Objection But it has led me into another Is it not your Opinion that by our Senses we perceive only the Ideas existing in our Minds  Phil  It is  Hyl  But the same Idea which is in my Mind cannot be in yours or in any other Mind Doth it not therefore follow from your Principles that no Two can see the same thing And is not this highly absurd  Phil  If the Term  same  be taken in the vulgar Acceptation it is certain and not at all repugnant to the Principles I maintain that different Persons may perceive the same Thing or the same Thing or Idea exist in  different Minds Words are of arbitrary Imposition and since Men are used to apply the Word  same  where no Distinct on or Variety is perceived and I do not pretend to alter their Perceptions it follows that as Men have said before  several saw the same thing  so they may upon like Occasions still continue to use the same Phrase without any Deviation either from Propriety of Language or the Truth of Things But if the Term  same  be used in the Acceptation of Philosophers who pretend to an abstracted Notion of Identity then according to their sundry Definitions of this Notion for it is not yet agreed wherein that Philosophic Identity consists it may or may not be possible for divers Persons to perceive the same thing But whether Philosophers shall think fit to call a thing the  same  or no is I conceive of small Importance Let us suppose several Men together all endued with the same Faculties and consequently affected in like sort by their Senses and who had yet never known the Use of Language they wou'd without question agree in their Perceptions Tho perhaps when they came to the Use of Speech some regarding the Uniformness of what was perceived might call it the  same  thing Others especially regarding the Diversity of Persons who perceived might choose the Denomination of  different  things  But who sees not that all the Dispute is about a Word  Viz  Whether what is perceived by different Persons may yet have the Term  same  applied to it Or suppose a House whose Walls or outward Shell remaining unaltered the Chambers are all pulled down and new ones built in their place and that you shou'd call this the  same  and I shou'd say it was not the  same  House Wou'd we not for all this perfectly agree in our Thoughts of the House considered in itself and wou'd not all the Difference consist in a Sound If you shou'd say We differed in our Notions for that you superadded to your Idea of the House the simple abstracted Idea of Identity whereas I did not I wou'd tell you I know not what you mean by that  abstracted Idea of Identity  and shou'd desire you to look into your own Thoughts and be sure you understood yourselfWhy so silent  Hylas  Are you not yet satisfied Men may dispute about Identity and Diversity without any real Difference in their Thoughts and Opinions abstracted from Names Take this farther Reflexion with you That whether Matter be allowed to exist or no the Case is exactly the same as to the Point in hand For the Materialists themselves acknowlege what we immediately perceive by our Senses to be our own Ideas Your Difficulty therefore that no  two see the same thing makes equally against the Materialists and me  Hyl  Ay  Philonous  but they suppose an external Archetype to which referring their several Ideas they may truly be said to perceive the same thing  Phil  And not to mention your having discarded those Archetypes so may you suppose an external Archetype on my Principles  external  I mean to your own Mind tho indeed it must be supposed to exist in that Mind which comprehends all things but then this serves all the Ends of Identity as well as if it existed out of a Mind And I am sure you yourself will not say It is less intelligible  Hyl  You have indeed clearly satisfied me either that there is no Difficulty at Bottom in this Point or if there be that it makes equally against both Opinions  Phil  But that which makes equally against two contradictory Opinions can be a Proof against neither  Hyl  I acknowlege it But after all  Philonous  when I consider the Substance of what you advance against  Scepticism  it amounts to no more than this We are sure that we really see hear feel in a Word that we are affected with sensible Impressions  Phil  And how are we concerned any farther I see this  Cherry  I feel it I taste it  And I am sure  nothing  cannot be seen or felt or tasted It is therefore  real  Take away the Sensations of Softness Moisture Redness Tartness and you take away the  Cherry  Since it is not a Being distinct from those Sensations a  Cherry  I say is nothing but a Congeries of sensible Impressions or Ideas perceived by various Senses Which Ideas are united into one thing or have one Name given them by the Mind because they are observed to attend each other Thus when the Palate is affected with such a particular Taste the Sight is affected with a red Colour the Touch with Roundness Softness  c  Hence when I see and feel and taste in such sundry certain Manners I am sure the  Cherry  exists or is real its Reality being in my Opinion nothing abstracted from those Sensations But if by the Word  Cherry  you mean an unknown Nature distinct from all those sensible Qualities and by its Existence something distinct from its being perceived Then indeed I own neither you nor I nor any one else can be sure it exists  Hyl  But what wou'd you say  Philonous  if I shou'd bring the very same Reasons against the Existence of sensible Things in a Mind which you have offered against their Existing in a material  Substratum  Phil  When I see your Reasons you shall hear what I have to say to them  Hyl  Is the Mind extended or unextended  Phil  Unextended without doubt  Hyl  Do you not say the Things you perceive are in your Mind  Phil  They are  Hyl  Again have I not heard you speak of sensible Impressions  Phil  I believe you may  Hyl  Explain to me now O  Philonous  how it is possible there shou'd be room for all those Trees and Houses to exist in your Mind Can extended Things be contained in that which is unextended Or are we to imagine Impressions made on a Thing void of all Solidity You cannot say Objects are in your Mind as Books in your Study Or that Things are imprinted on it as the Figure of a Seal upon Wax In what Sense therefore are we to understand those Expressions Explain me this if you can And I shall then be able to answer all those Queries you formerly put to me about my  Substratum  Phil  Look you  Hylas  when I speak of Objects as existing in the Mind or imprinted on the Senses I wou'd not be understood in the gross literal Sense as when Bodies are said to exist in a place or a Seal to make an Impression upon Wax My Meaning is  only that the Mind comprehends or perceives them and that it is affected from without or by some Being distinct from itself This is my Explication of your Difficulty and how it can serve to make your Tenent of an unperceiving material  Substratum  intelligible I wou'd fain know  Hyl  Nay if that be all I confess I do not see what Use can be made of it But are you not guilty of some Abuse of Language in this  Phil  None at all It is no more than common Custom which you know is the Rule of Language has authorized Nothing being more usual than for Philosophers to speak of the immediate Objects of the Understanding as Things existing in the Mind Nor is there any thing in this but what is conformable to the general Analogy of Language most part of the mental Operations being signified by Words borrowed from sensible Things as is plain in the Terms  Comprehend Reflect Discourse c  which being applied to the Mind must not be taken in their gross original Sense  Hyl  You have I own satisfied me in this Point But there still remains one great Difficulty which I know not how you will get over And indeed it is of such Importance that if you cou'd solve all others without being able to find a Solution for this you must  never expect to make me a Proselyte to your Principles  Phil  Let me know this mighty Difficulty  Hyl  The Scripture Account of the Creation is what appears to me utterly irreconcilable with your Notions  Moses  tells us of a Creation A Creation of what of Ideas No certainly but of Things of real Things solid corporeal Substances Bring your Principles to agree with this and I shall the sooner agree with you  Phil  Moses  mentions the Sun Moon and Stars Earth and Sea Plants and Animals That all these do really exist and were in the Beginning created by God I make no question If by  Ideas  you mean Fictions and Fancies of the Mind then these are no Ideas If by  Ideas  you mean immediate Objects of the Understanding or sensible Things which cannot exist unperceived or out of a Mind then these Things are Ideas But whether you do or do not call them  Ideas  it matters little The Difference is only about a Name And whether that Name be retained or rejected the Sense the Truth and Reality of Things continues the same In common Talk the Objects of our Senses are not termed  Ideas  but  Things  Call them so still Provided you do not attribute to them any absolute external Existence and  I shall never quarrel with you for a Word The Creation therefore I allow to have been a Creation of Things of  Real  Things Neither is this in the least inconsistent with my Principles as is evident from what I have now said and wou'd have been evident to you without this if you had not forgotten what had been so often said before But as for solid corporeal Substances I desire you to shew where  Moses  makes any mention of them and if they shou'd be mentioned by him or any other inspired Writer it wou'd still be incumbent on you to shew those Words were not taken in the vulgar Acceptation for Things falling under our Senses but in the Philosophic Acceptation for Matter or an unknown Quiddity with an absolute Existence When you have proved these Points then and not till then may you bring the Authority of  Moses  into our Dispute  Hyl  It is in vain to dispute about a Point so clear I am content to refer it to your own Conscience Are you not satisfied there is some peculiar Repugnancy between the  Mosaic  Account of the Creation and your Notions  Phil  If all possible Sense which can be put on the First Chapter of  Genesis  may be conceived as consistently with my Principles as any other then it has no peculiar Repugnancy  with them But there is no Sense you may not as well conceive believing as I do Since beside Spirits all you conceive are Ideas and the Existence of these I do not deny Neither do you pretend they exist without the Mind  Hyl  Pray let me see any Sense you can understand it in  Phil  Why I imagine that if I had been present at the Creation I should have seen Things produced into Being that is become perceptible in the Order described by the Sacred Historian I ever before believed the  Mosaic  Account of the Creation and now find no Alteration in my Manner of believing it When Things are said to begin or end their Existence we do not mean this with regard to God but His Creatures All Objects are eternally known by God or which is the same thing have an eternal Existence in his Mind But when Things before unperceptible to Creatures are by a Decree of God made perceptible to them then are they said to begin a relative Existence with respect to created Minds Upon reading therefore the  Mosaic  Account of the Creation I understand that the several Parts of the World became gradually perceivable to finite Spirits endowed with proper Faculties so that whoever such were present they were in truth perceived by them This is the literal  obvious Sense suggested to me by the Words of the Holy Scripture In which is included no Mention or no Thought either of  Substratum  Instrument Occasion or absolute Existence And upon Inquiry I doubt not it will be found that most plain honest Men who believe the Creation never think of those things any more than I What metaphysical Sense you may understand it in you only can tell  Hyl  But  Philonous  you do not seem to be aware that you allow created Things in the Beginning only a relative and consequently hypothetical Being That is to say upon Supposition there were Men to perceive them without which they have no Actuality of absolute Existence wherein Creation might terminate Is it not therefore according to you plainly impossible the Creation of any inanimate Creatures shou'd precede that of Man And is not this directly contrary to the  Mosaic  Account  Phil  In Answer to that I say  First  Created Beings might begin to exist in the Mind of other created Intelligences beside Men You will not therefore be able to prove any Contradiction between  Moses  and my Notions unless you first shew there was no other Order of finite created Spirits in Being before Man I say farther in case we conceive the Creation as we shou'd at  this time a Parcel of Plants or Vegetables of all sorts produced by an invisible Power in a Desert where no body was present That this Way of explaining or conceiving it is consistent with my Principles since they deprive you of nothing either sensible or imaginable That it exactly suits with the common natural undebauched Notions of Mankind That it manifests the Dependence of all Things on God and consequently has all the good Effect or Influence which it is possible that important Article of our Faith shou'd have in making Men humble thankful and resigned to their great Creator I say moreover that in this naked Conception of Things divested of Words there will not be found any Notion of what you call the  Actuality of absolute Existence  You may indeed raise a Dust with those Terms and so lengthen our Dispute to no purpose But I intreat you calmly to look into your own Thoughts and then tell me if they are not an useless and unintelligible Jargon  Hyl  I own I have no very clear Notion annexed to them But what say you to this Do you not make the Existence of sensible Things consist in their being in a Mind And were not all Things eternally in the Mind of God Did they not therefore exist from all Eternity according to you And how cou'd that which was Eternal be created  in Time Can any thing be clearer or better connected than this  Phil  And are not you too of Opinion that God knew all Things from Eternity  Hyl  I am  Phil  Consequently they always had a Being in the Divine Intellect  Hyl  This I acknowlege  Phil  By your own Confession therefore nothing is New or begins to be in respect of the Mind of God So we are agreed in that Point  Hyl  What shall we make then of the Creation  Phil  May we not understand it to have been intirely in respect of finite Spirits so that Things with regard to us may properly be said to begin their Existence or be Created when God decreed they shou'd become perceptible to intelligent Creatures in that Order and Manner which He then establish'd and we now call the Laws of Nature You may call this a  relative  or  hypothetical Existence  if you please But so long as it supplies us with the most natural obvious and literal Sense of the  Mosaic  History of the Creation so long as it answers all the religious Ends of that great Article in a Word so long as you can assign no other Sense or Meaning in its stead why shou'd we reject this Is it to comply with a ridiculous  Sceptical Humor of making every thing Nonsense and Unintelligible I am sure you cannot say it is for the Glory of God For allowing it to be a thing possible and conceivable that the corporeal World shou'd have an absolute Subsistence extrinsical to the Mind of God as well as to the Minds of all created Spirits Yet how cou'd this set forth either the Immensity or Omniscience of the Deity or the necessary and immediate Dependence of all things on Him Nay wou'd it not rather seem to derogate from those Attributes  Hyl  Well but as to this Decree of God's for making Things perceptible What say you  Philonous  is it not plain God did either execute that Decree from all Eternity or at some certain time began to will what He had not actually willed before but only designed to will If the former then there cou'd be no Creation or Beginning of Existence in finite Things If the latter then we must acknowlege something new to befall the Deity which implies a sort of Change and all Change argues Imperfection  Phil  Pray consider what you are doing Is it not evident this Objection concludes equally against a Creation in any Sense nay against every other Act of the Deity discoverable by the Light of Nature None of which can we conceive otherwise than as performed  in Time and having a Beginning God is a Being of transcendent and unlimited Perfections His Nature therefore is incomprehensible to finite Spirits It is not therefore to be expected that any Man whether  Materialist  or  Immaterialist  shou'd have exactly just Notions of the Deity His Attributes and Ways of Operation If then you wou'd infer any thing against me your Difficulty must not be drawn from the Inadequateness of our Conceptions of the Divine Nature which is unavoidable on any Scheme but from the Denial of Matter of which there is not one Word directly or indirectly in what you have now objected  Hyl  I must acknowlege the Difficulties you are concerned to clear are such only as arise from the Nonexistence of Matter and are peculiar to that Notion So far you are in the right But I cannot by any means bring myself to think there is no such peculiar Repugnancy between the Creation and your Opinion tho indeed where to fix it I do not distinctly know  Phil  What wou'd you have do I not acknowlege a twofold State of Things the one Ectypal or Natural the other Archetypal and Eternal The former was created in Time the latter existed from Everlasting in the Mind of God Is not this agreeable to the common Notions of Divines or is any more  than this necessary in order to conceive the Creation But you suspect some peculiar Repugnancy tho you know not where it lies To take away all Possibility of Scruple in the case do but consider this one Point Either you are not able to conceive the Creation on any Hypothesis whatsoever And if so there is no ground for Dislike or Complaint against my particular Opinion on that Score Or you are able to conceive it and if so why not on my Principles since thereby nothing conceivable is taken away You have all along been allowed the full Scope of Sense Imagination and Reason Whatever therefore you cou'd before apprehend either immediately or mediately by your Senses or by Ratiocination from your Senses whatever you cou'd perceive imagine or understand remains still with you If therefore the Notion you have of the Creation by other Principles be intelligible you have it still upon mine if it be not intelligible I conceive it to be no Notion at all and so there is no Loss of it And indeed it seems to me very plain that the Supposition of Matter  i e  a thing perfectly unknown and inconceivable cannot serve to make us conceive any thing And I hope it need not be proved to you that if the Existence of Matter does not make the Creation conceivable the Creation's being  without it inconceivable can be no Objection against its NonExistence  Hyl  I confess  Philonous  you have almost satisfied me in this Point of the Creation  Phil  I wou'd fain know why you are not quite satisfied You tell me indeed of a Repugnancy between the  Mosaic  History and Immaterialism But you know not where it lies Is this reasonable  Hylas  Can you expect I shou'd solve a Difficulty without knowing what it is But to pass by all that Wou'd not a Man think you were assured there is no Repugnancy between the received Notions of Materialists and the inspired Writings  Hyl  And so I am  Phil  Ought the Historical Part of Scripture to be understood in a plain obvious Sense or in a Sense which is metaphysical and out of the way  Hyl  In the plain Sense doubtless  Phil  When  Moses  speaks of Herbs Earth Water  c  as having been created by God think you not the sensible Things commonly signified by those Words are suggested to every unphilosophical Reader  Hyl  I cannot help thinking so  Phil  And are not all Ideas or Things perceived by Sense to be denied a real Existence by the Doctrine of the Materialists  Hyl  This I have already acknowleged  Phil  The Creation therefore according to them was not the Creation of Things sensible which have only a relative Being but of certain unknown Natures which have an absolute Being wherein Creation might terminate  Hyl  True  Phil  Is it not therefore evident the Asserters of Matter destroy the plain obvious Sense of  Moses  with which their Notions are utterly inconsistent and instead of it obtrude on us I know not what something equally unintelligible to themselves and me  Hyl  I cannot contradict you  Phil  Moses  tells us of a Creation A Creation of what of unknown Quiddities of Occasions or  Substratums  No certainly but of Things obvious to the Senses You must first reconcile this with your Notions if you expect I shou'd be reconciled to them  Hyl  I see you can assault me with my own Weapons  Phil  Then as to  absolute Existence  was there ever known a more jejune Notion than that Something it is so abstracted and unintelligible that you have frankly owned you cou'd not conceive it much less explain any thing by it But allowing Matter to exist and the Notion of absolute Existence to be as clear as Light yet was this ever known to make the Creation more credible Nay has  it not furnished the  Atheists  and  Infidels  of all Ages with the most plausible Argument against a Creation That a corporeal Substance which hath an absolute Existence without the Minds of Spirits shou'd be produced out of nothing by the meer Will of a Spirit has been looked upon as a thing so contrary to all Reason so impossible and absurd that not only the most celebrated among the Ancients but even divers Modern and Christian Philosophers have thought Matter coeternal with the Deity Lay these things together and then judge you whether Materialism disposes Men to believe the Creation of Things  Hyl  I own  Philonous  I think it does not This of the  Creation  is the last Objection I can think of and I must needs own it has been sufficiently answered as well as the rest Nothing now remains to be overcome but a sort of unaccountable Backwardness that I find in myself toward your Notions  Phil  When a Man is swayed he knows not why to one Side of a Question Can this think you be any thing else but the Effect of Prejudice which never fails to attend old and rooted Notions And indeed in this respect I cannot deny the Belief of Matter to have very much the Advantage over the contrary Opinion with Men of a learned Education  Hyl  I confess it seems to be as you say  Phil  As a Balance therefore to this Weight of Prejudice let us throw into the Scale the great Advantages that arise from the Belief of Immaterialism both in regard to Religion and Humane Learning The Being of a God and Incorruptibility of the Soul those great Articles of Religion are they not proved with the clearest and most immediate Evidence When I say the Being of a  God  I do not mean an obscure general Cause of Things whereof we have no Conception but  God  in the strict and proper Sense of the Word A Being whose Spirituality Omnipresence Providence Omniscience Infinite Power and Goodness are as conspicuous as the Existence of sensible Things of which notwithstanding the fallacious Pretences and affected Scruples of  Sceptics  there is no more reason to doubt than of our own Being Then with relation to Humane Sciences in Natural Philosophy what Intricacies what Obscurities what Contradictions has the Belief of Matter led Men into To say nothing of the numberless Disputes about its Extent Continuity Homogeneity Gravity Divisibility  c  do they not pretend to explain all things by Bodies operating on Bodies according to the Laws of Motion and yet are they able to comprehend how any one Body shou'd move another Nay admitting there  was no Difficulty in reconciling the Notion of an inert Being with a Cause or in conceiving how an Accident might pass from one Body to another yet by all their strained Thoughts and extravagant Suppositions have they been able to reach the mechanical Production of any one Animal or Vegetable Body Can they account by the Laws of Motion for Sounds Tastes Smells or Colours or for the regular Course of Things In fine have they accounted by Physical Principles for the Aptitude and Contrivance even of the most inconsiderable Parts of the Universe But laying aside Matter and corporeal Causes and admitting only the Efficiency of an Allperfect Mind are not all the Effects of Nature easy and intelligible If the  Phaenomena  are nothing else but  Ideas  God is a a  Spirit  but Matter an unintelligent unperceiving Being If they demonstrate an unlimited Power in their Cause God is Active and Omnipotent but Matter an inert Mass If the Order Regularity and Usefulness of them can never be sufficiently admired God is infinitely Wise and Provident but Matter destitute of all Contrivance and Design These surely are great Advantages in  Physics  Not to mention that the Apprehension of a distant Deity naturally disposes Men to a Negligence in their  moral  Actions which they wou'd be more cautious of in case they  thought Him immediately present and acting on their Minds without the Interposition of Matter or unthinking Second Causes Then in  Metaphysics  what Difficulties concerning Entity in Abstract Substantial Forms Hylarchic Principles Plastic Natures Subjects and Adjuncts Principles of Individuation Possibility of Matter's thinking Origine of Ideas the Manner how two independent Substances so widely different as  Spirit  and  Matter  shou'd mutually operate on each other What Difficulties I say and endless Disquisitions concerning these and innumerable other the like Points do we escape by supposing only Spirits and Ideas Even the  Mathematics  themselves if we take away the absolute Existence of extended Things become much more clear and easy the most shocking Paradoxes and intricate Speculations in those Sciences depending on the infinite Divisibility of finite Extension which depends on that Supposition But what need is there to insist on the particular Sciences Is not that Opposition to all Science whatsoever that Frenzy of the ancient and modern  Sceptics  built on the same Foundation Or can you produce so much as one Argument against the Reality of corporeal Things or in behalf of that avowed utter Ignorance of their Natures which does not suppose their Reality to consist in an external absolute Existence Upon this Supposition  indeed the Objections from the Change of Colours in a Pigeon's Neck or the Appearances of a broken Oar in the Water must be allowed to have Weight But those and the like Objections vanish if we do not maintain the Being of absolute exterternal Originals but place the Reality of Things in Ideas fleeting indeed and changeable however not changed at random but according to the fixed Order of Nature For herein consists that Constancy and Truth of Things which secures all the Concerns of Life and distinguishes that which is  real  from the irregular Visions of the Fancy  Hyl  I agree to all you have now said and must own that nothing can incline me to embrace your Opinion more than the Advantages I see it is attended with I am by Nature lazy and this wou'd be a mighty Abridgment in Knowlege What Doubts what Hypotheses what Labyrinths of Amusement what Fields of Disputation what an Ocean of false Learning may be avoided by that single Notion of  Immaterialism  Phil  After all is there any thing farther remaining to be done You may remember you promised to embrace that Opinion which upon Examination shou'd appear most agreeable to common Sense and remote from  Scepticism  This by your own Confession is that which denies Matter or the absolute  Existence of corporeal Things Nor is this all The same Notion has been proved several Ways viewed in different Lights pursued in its Consequences and all Objections against it cleared Can there be a greater Evidence of its Truth or is it possible it shou'd have all the Marks of a true Opinion and yet be false  Hyl  I own myself intirely satisfied for the present in all respects But what Security can I have that I shall still continue the same full Assent to your Opinion and that no unthoughtof Objection or Difficulty will occur hereafter  Phil  Pray  Hylas  do you in other Cases when a Point is once evidently proved withhold your Assent on account of Objections or Difficulties it may be liable to Are the Difficulties that attend the Doctrine of incommensurable Quantities of the Angle of Contact of the Asymptotes to Curves or the like sufficient to make you hold out against Mathematical Demonstration Or will you disbelieve the Providence of God because there may be some particular things which you know not how to reconcile with it If there are Difficulties attending Immaterialism there are at the same time direct and evident Proofs for it But for the Existence of Matter there is not one Proof and far more numerous and insurmountable Objections lie  against it But where are those mighty Difficulties you insist on Alas you know not where or what they are something which may possibly occur hereafter If this be a sufficient Pretence for withholding your full Assent you shou'd never yield it to any Proposition how free soever from Exceptions how clearly and solidly soever demonstrated  Hyl  You have satisfied me  Philonous  Phil  But to arm you against all future Objections do but consider That which bears equally hard on two contradictory Opinions can be a Proof against neither Whenever therefore any Difficulty occurs try if you can find a Solution for it on the Hypothesis of the  Materialists  Be not deceived by Words but sound your own Thoughts And in case you cannot conceive it easier by the Help of  Materialism  it is plain it can be no Objection against  Immaterialism  Had you proceeded all along by this Rule you wou'd probably have spared yourself abundance of trouble in objecting since of all your Difficulties I challenge you to shew one that is explained by Matter nay which is not more unintelligible with than without that Supposition and consequently makes rather  against  than  for  it You shou'd consider in each Particular whether the Difficulty arises from the  Nonexistence of Matter  If it does not you might as well argue from the infinite Divisibility of Extension against the Divine Prescience as from such a Difficulty against  Immaterialism  And yet upon Recollection I believe you will find this to have been often if not always the Case You shou'd likewise take heed not to argue on a  petitio Principii  One is apt to say The unknown Substances ought to be esteemed real Things rather than the Ideas in our Minds And who can tell but the unthinking external Substance may concurr as a Cause or Instrument in the Production of our Ideas But is not this proceeding on a Supposition that there are such external Substances And to suppose this is it not Begging the Question But above all things you shou'd beware of imposing on yourself by that vulgar Sophism which is called  Ignoratio Elenchi  You talked often as if you thought I maintained the Nonexistence of sensible Things Whereas in truth no one can be more thorowly assured of their Existence than I am And it is you who doubt I shou'd have said positively deny it Every thing that is seen felt heard or any way perceived by the Senses is on the Principles I embrace a real Being but not on yours Remember the Matter you contend for is an unknown somewhat if  indeed it may be termed  somewhat  which is quite stripped of all sensible Qualities and can neither be perceived by Sense nor apprehended by the Mind Remember I say that it is not any Object which is hard or soft hot or cold blue or white round or square  c  For all these things I affirm do exist Tho indeed I deny they have an Existence distinct from being perceived or that they exist out of all Minds whatsoever Think on these Points let them be attentively considered and still kept in view Otherwise you will not comprehend the State of the Question without which your Objections will always be wide of the Mark and instead of mine may possibly be directed as more than once they have been against your own Notions  Hyl  I must needs own  Philonous  nothing seems to have kept me from agreeing with you more than this same  mistaking the Question  In denying Matter at first glympse I am tempted to imagine you deny the Things we see and feel but upon Reflexion find there is no Ground for it What think you therefore of retaining the Name  Matter  and applying it to sensible Things This may be done without any Change in your Sentiments And believe me it wou'd be a Means of reconciling them to some Persons  who may be more shocked at an Innovation in Words than in Opinion  Phil  With all my Heart Retain the Word  Matter  and apply it to the Objects of Sense if you please provided you do not attribute to them any Subsistence distinct from their being perceived I shall never quarrel with you for an Expression  Matter  or  material Substance  are Terms introduced by Philosophers and as used by them imply a sort of Independency or a Subsistence distinct from being perceived by a Mind But are never used by common People or if ever it is to signify the immediate Objects of Sense One wou'd think therefore so long as the Names of all particular Things with the Terms  sensible Substance Body Stuff  and the like are retained the Word  Matter  shou'd be never missed in common Talk And in Philosophical Discourses it seems the best way to leave it quite out since there is not perhaps any one thing that hath more favored and strengthened the depraved Bent of the Mind toward  Atheism  than the Use of that general confused Term  Hyl  Well but  Philonous  since I am content to give up the Notion of an unthinking Substance exterior to the Mind I think you ought not to deny me the Privilege of  using the Word  Matter  as I please and annexing it to a Collection of sensible Qualities subsisting only in the Mind I freely own there is no other Substance in a strict Sense than  Spirit  But I have been so long accustomed to the Term  Matter  that I know not how to part with it To say There is no  Matter  in the World is still shocking to me Whereas to say There is no  Matter  if by that Term be meant an unthinking Substance existing without the Mind But if by  Matter  is meant some sensible Thing whose Existence consists in being perceived then there is  Matter  This Distinction gives it quite another Turn And Men will come into your Notions with small Difficulty when they are proposed in that manner For after all the Controversy about  Matter  in the strict Acceptation of it lies altogether between you and the Philosophers whose Principles I acknowlege are not near so natural or so agreeable to the common Sense of Mankind and Holy Scripture as yours There is nothing we either desire or shun but as it makes or is apprehended to make some Part of our Happiness or Misery But what has Happiness or Misery Joy or Grief Pleasure or Pain to do with absolute Existence or with unknown Entities abstracted from all Relation  to us It is evident Things regard us only as they are pleasing or displeasing And they can please or displease only so far forth as they are perceived Farther therefore we are not concerned and thus far you leave things as you found them Yet still there is something new in this Doctrine It is plain I do not now think with the Philosophers nor yet altogether with the Vulgar I wou'd know how the Case stands in that respect Precisely what you have added to or altered in my former Notions  Phil  I do not pretend to be a Setterup of  New Notions  My Endeavors tend only to unite and place in a clearer Light that Truth which was before shared between the Vulgar and the Philosophers The former being of Opinion that  those Things they immediately perceive are the real Things  and the latter that  the Things immediately perceived are Ideas which exist only in the Mind  Which Two Notions put together do in effect constitute the Substance of what I advance  Hyl  I have been a long time distrusting my Senses methought I saw things by a dim Light and thro false Glasses Now the Glasses are removed and a new Light breaks in upon my Understanding I am clearly convinced that I see things in their  native Forms and am no longer in Pain about their unknown Natures or absolute Existence This is the State I find myself in at present Tho indeed the Course that brought me to it I do not yet thorowly comprehend You set out upon the same Principles that  Academics Cartesians  and the like Sects usually do and for a long time it looked as if you were advancing their Philosophical  Scepticism  but in the End your Conclusions are directly opposite to theirs  Phil  You see  Hylas  the Water of yonder Fountain how it is forced upwards in a round Column to a certain Height at which it breaks and falls back into the Bason from whence it rose Its Ascent as well as Descent proceeding from the same uniform Law or Principle of  Gravitation  Just so the same Principles which at first View lead to  Scepticism  pursued to a certain Point bring Men back to common Sense  FINIS
