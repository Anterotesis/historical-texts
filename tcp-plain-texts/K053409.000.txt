 A TRACT ON THE LAW OF NATURE AND PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MAN  BY GRANVILLE SHARP  For ye are all the  SONS OF GOD  by Faith in Christ Jesus  GAL iii  "one is your Master  even CHRIST  and  ALL YE ARE BRETHREN  And""one is your Father which is in Heaven"  MATTH xxiii  LONDON Printed for B WHITE at Horace's Head in Fleetstreet and E and C DILLY in the Poultry  MDCCLXXVII  A TRACT ON THE LAW OF NATURE c  I HAVE neither leisure nor abilities to undertake a regular definition of  the Law of Nature  with all the doctrines usually ranked under that head and indeed if I had both leisure and abili∣ties I should want inclination because such a work would unavoidably become voluminous on account of the variety of authors necessary to be mentioned who have treated the subject with dif∣ferent views and as all science is vain which is not reduced to practice so the more voluminous any subject is ren∣dered  the less it can be useful on ac∣count of the increased difficulty of com∣municating it to the generality of read∣ers I have therefore confined my tract to such  general  remarks on the subject as are most necessary for the observation of my countrymen at large with respect more particularly to one point viz  the Illegality  of reducing or subjecting man∣kind to  involuntary servitude  either under political or private dominion as all pre∣tensions to an  unlimited authority  of any man or men over others are con∣trary to  Natural Equity  and the  Laws of God  as well as baneful to mankind in general which effect is unhappily de∣monstrated by the numberless instances of  unnatural  oppression now prevailing to the destruction of mankind in almost every part of the world I have already shewn in my answer  This answer to Mr Thompson is confined to one kind of slavery only viz  the oppression of private tyrants  or petty slaveholders and has already been printed  in America  and therefore I need not now repeat the argu∣ments which it contains especially as I propose soon to re∣print it in England with some other tracts expressly against  domestick slavery  such as is  unlawfully tolerated  in the British colonies  to the Reverend  Mr Thompson an advocate for the African slave trade that the Jewish con∣stitutions were not strictly consistent  with the Law of Nature in all points  and consequently that they are not to be considered as the rule by which law∣yers and casuists may safely determine  "what is or what is not according to Nature"  The  Law of Nature  has been variously represented but all the best writers both ancient and modern agree in adopt∣ing that maxim of the Civil Insti∣tutes  Servitus  autem est constitutio Juris Gentium qua quis dominio alieno  contra naturam  subjicitur" Justin Institutes Book Tit  From whence the other authorities in the  Common Law  of England seem to be derived  § Est quidem  Servitus  constitutio Juris Gentium qua quis dominio alieno  contra naturam  subjicitur" c  BRACTON Lib Cap  "Est quidem  Servitus libertati contrarium  item con∣stitutio quaedam de Jure Gentium qua quis dominio alieno  contra naturam  subjicitur" c  FLETA Lib Cap  "  Servitude  is a constitution of the Law of Nations by which  contrary to Nature  one is subjected to another's power"  COWELL'S Institutes Tit  which declares  involuntary ser∣vitude  or  slavery to be "contrary to the Law of Nature"  this rule is commonly understood as applicable only to  domestic slavery  but it is equally true when ap∣plied to  political oppression  or the exer∣cise of an  unlimited dominion  over a whole nation Some few authors indeed have been so unreasonable as to assert that  "there is no such thing as natural Law"  but they are properly censured by the learned Baron Puffendorf in his "Law of Nature and Nations" Book Chap  He particularly mentions the argu∣ment of Carniades as contracted by Lac∣tantius to the following effect  "That men first instituted Laws to secure and promote their own advantage c but that there was no such thing as  Natural Law  in the world" c p  Such doctrine is certainly very con∣venient for Tyrants and Slaveholders of every degree who must otherwise re∣main without excuse whenever  "the Law of Nature"  and  "the Common Rights of Humanity"  are urged against them it is therefore necessary for them either to misrepresent  the Law of Nature  as the Reverend Mr Thompson has done or else like Carniades utterly to deny its existence This latter method has been also adopted by some modern advocates for  Slavery  who in private discourse on this subject have declared that they esteem  "the Law of Nature"  to be no other than their  natural  pro∣pensity to pursue their own heart's desire of profit or pleasure and this they call  "natural Liberty"  though it certainly is the most  unnatural Tyranny  for when the immutable necessity of  reciprocal con∣sideration  is forgot or set aside there can be no safety among men and con∣sequently no  natural Liberty  we must therefore submit ourselves to be  the ser∣vants of law  in order to be truly  free  according to the excellent observation of Cicero "Legum denique idcirco om∣nes  Servi  sumus ut  liberi  esse possumus" Tom p  Hamburgh Edition  We may learn from the histories of all nations that Lust Ava∣rice Pride Revenge Love of Power Jea∣lousy c are  Principles of Action  which unavoidably produce  oppression  and  wrongs  to the destruction of the human species in all places where  will  and  pleasure  whether in political or private domi∣nion  are supreme  or whenever  Selflove  and  Private Interest  become entirely predominant among men That  Selflove  is predominant with the  generality of mankind  is but too apparent yet we are not therefore obliged to admit that  "Selflove" is "the universal principle of action"  though an eminent and learn∣ed  lawwriter  has with very good in∣tentions as his argument proves thought proper to give it that title  "Honesty  indeed  is the best policy"  even for a  selfish man  to pursue and it is certain that the solid attainments of virtue and justice afford a real and sub∣stantial satisfaction which in the end most amply fulfils the purposes of  Selflove  But though  Virtue  and  Honesty  are thus favourable to  Selflove  in their  natural effects  yet this by no means proves that  Selflove  is the  motive  of all  virtuous  and  honest  men or that it is the  "universal principle of action"  for if that were really the case many of the most amiable virtues must be esteemed mere empty names There could be no true Gene∣rosity or Benevolence no Disinterested Goodness of heart no sincere  Natural Affection  between parents and their chil∣dren husbands and their wives brethren friends c whereas history affords many undoubted instances of  Selflove  being lost in  the superior affections natural to generous minds  in all these different de∣grees of connection but it is needless to recite them since even in the brute creation there are  natural  That excellent English lawyer the Great Henry de Bracton informs us that  "Natural Law  is that which  Nature  or more properly God himself has  taught all animals"  "Jus  Naturale  est quod  Natura  i e ipse Deus docuit  omnia animalia" c and afterwards he fur∣ther explains himself saying "Jus Naturale quod docuit omnia animalia Natura i e per instinctum Naturae c viz Natural Law which taught all animals by  Nature  that is through the instinct of Nature" c Lib c  affections  superior to  Selflove  The common hen is so inflamed with  Natural Affection  and anxious care for her tender brood that she seems to have as little sense of  Selflove  in time of danger as of her own weakness for she will boldly fly in the face of every invader except man however superior in size or strength to herself  The timorous cow it is said will attack the fiercest tyger when her calf is by her side Many instances of very extraordinary  Affection  in dogs to their masters have been well attested Those faithful animals have sometimes been known to lose all sense of danger to themselves in the necessary defence of their owners And the very swine dis∣cover such a  Natural Affection  and real sympathy for their brethren of the sty  whenever they hear their cries of distress that their example ought to shame the depraved part of mankind imperial ty∣rants and royal robbers who extend their dominion by breach of faith un∣lawful invasion murder and rapine as also those petty tyrants and destroyers of mankind the African traders and Ame∣rican slaveholders lest the  affectionate brute  notwithstanding his  sensuality  should seem on comparison  a more ge∣nerous  and therefore a more  noble animal  than that  Man  who stifles all  Natural Affection  Fellowfeeling and Charity to  his kind  merely for the sake of acquiring power or worldly profit to himself and surely a time will come when all such offenders against  the Law of Nature  who prefer the wages of unrighteous∣ness to the  natural  dictates of  Humanity  and  Conscience  will have reason to esteem the lot of the most contemptible  brute  infinitely more eligible than their own  Now as it appears that  "Selflove"  is not the  "universal Principle of Action"  even in  brutes  much less ought it to be esteemed so in  mankind  because the  human soul  besides the  Natural Affection  which men ought to have in common with other creatures is endowed with a much more noble principle or motive to good actions I mean  Reason  or that  "Knowledge of good and evil"  which we inherit from our first parents and which they  unlawfully  took upon themselves at the instigation of their  spiritual enemy  that they might thereby be rendered  accountable for all their actions  and through  Knowledge  "But of the tree of  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen ii  become guilty before God  The history of that fatal transaction demands our most careful consideration since all mankind are particularly affected  by it And surely the principles of  our own Nature  are subjects of enquiry infi∣nitely more important to us than all the other branches of  natural Philosophy  and yet perhaps they are less examined by men of science and consequently are less understood than any other but in vain is the most accurate knowledge of plants drugs fossils and minerals or of the exact revolutions of the heavenly bodies and of the nature and properties of all the elements c if the philoso∣pher is  unacquainted with himself  Multi enim multa sciunt  et scipsos nesciunt  sed qui  seipsum nescit nihil b  ne novit  quàm alia scire et se nescire quid aliud est quam seipsum gravius condempnare c Doct Stud c  and the properties and state of his own soul which is too often the case Knowledge in all the former particulars is indeed honourable and praiseworthy but in the latter it is indispensable for when men through ignorance of the  compouna Nature  of man slight the common means  which God has revealed to guard their minds against  intellectual deceptions  they are sure to be perverted  in their princi∣ples  to the imminent danger both of body and soul Such an one probably thinks himself  too judicious  a critic to admit the Mosaic account of the subject now before us viz  the Fall of Man  at least in the  literal  sense of the text so that the doctrines which I propose to collect from it will have very little weight I fear with men of that stamp Never∣theless as there are many doctrines in other parts of Scripture which corro∣borate the  literal  meaning of that rela∣tion and as there are also several cir∣cumstances discoverable in the  Nature of Man  which cannot otherwise be rea∣sonably accounted for I must beg my readers to excuse me even if they think me too prolix in my examination of that part of the sacred history which I con∣ceive to be absolutely necessary for the  obtaining a true practical idea of the  Law of Nature  and the  Principles of Action in Man  God delivered a clear and express Law to  Man  before the fall  but of the tree of  Knowledge of Good and Evil thou shalt not eat of it  and then fol∣lows the denunciation of punishment  for  in the day  that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely  DIE  Gen ii  This was the  first and only penal Law  A FORFEITURE OF LIFE And though we find afterwards that the declared punishment was not immediately exe∣cuted according to the letter that is the penalty of  death  was not inflicted on  the day  of the transgression as it seemed to be at first ordained yet this affords no just exception against the truth and pro∣priety of the relation  The same ALMIGHTY BEING who had  a right  as all things are his own to prohibit the action abovementioned and to assign a punishment for disobe∣dience had certainly  a right  also to re∣spite or postpone or even to remit if he had been pleased to do so the exe∣cution of  the Law  which he himself had ordained But for the present it is sufficient to remark that the  nature of the penalty  had been clearly revealed to our first parents and was as clearly un∣derstood by them so that they were sufficiently sensible of their obligation to observe the said  Law  previous to their breach of it which plainly appears by the speech of the woman to the tempter viz  But of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden GOD  hath said  ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it  lest ye die  After so clear an acknowledgment of the  divine  precept the act of taking the fruit which otherwise in itself would probably have been no crime was cer∣tainly a  wilful sin  of a very heinous na∣ture being a  gross contempt of God's word  for which our first parents very justly incurred the  penalty of death  which they were previously told must be the consequence of disobedience  They had received this caution even  from God himself  whom they knew to be their Maker and Supreme Lord and yet the unwary woman unhappily listened to an assertion that was absolutely contra∣dictory to her  Creator's word  and there∣by drew upon herself and all her de∣scendants the irrevocable doom to  la∣bourpain  and  mortality  Perhaps the haughty philosopher will now be ready to arraign the justice of  the divine decree which involved the innocent progeny that is innocent with respect to this particular crime in the punishment of their  guilty parents  but if he will patiently follow me through this examination of  Human Na∣ture  he will perhaps be able to form a better idea of the  Nature of original Sin  and of the cause of its being in∣tailed or rather  the effects  of its being  intailed  on all the descendants of Adam For the immediate  effect  of that  original Sin  of our first parents was the acqui∣sition of  an additional faculty  even of a divine attribute to the  Nature of Man  which of course descends from these original stocks by  natural inheritance  to all their progeny and thereby inevitably  involves them all  in the same condem∣nation the manner of which shall be more particularly explained hereafter This very ancient example of punish∣ment for a  contempt of God's word  the  direful effects of which  labour pain  and  mortality  are ever before us should teach mankind the extreme danger of paying attention to any doctrines and interpretations of Law or Religion that have the least tendency to oppose or con∣tradict the literal or most obvious mean∣ing of God's word for the efforts of our  spiritual Enemy  are never more bane∣ful than when he is pleased to assume the office of a commentator on the Laws of God in which character he is fre∣quently discoverable for though he does not now present himself  outwardly  or  ap∣parently  as at first in the assumed shape of a serpent yet the venom of his doctrines is too often sufficiently distinguishable both in the writings and discourses of men And it is remarkable that his first attempt against mankind should be in the capacity of a  critick  on the  Divine Law  The influence of  spiritual enemies  is indeed a distinct  Principle of Action in  Man  which shall be more particularly mentioned in the course of this Tract  But to return to the first fatal in∣stance beforementioned of Satan's suc∣cess in misleading mankind  which  oc∣casioned another distinct  Principle of Action in Man  It appears that the Tempter was well well acquainted with the true nature and effects of the forbidden fruit which he declared indeed but not without utter∣ing at the same time a notorious false∣hood  Ye  shall not surely die  said he for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof  viz of the fruit taken from the tree of knowledge  then your eyes shall be opened and  ye shall be as gods knowing Good and Evil  Gen iii  Now this acquisition of  Knowledge  which the Tempter promised was really such as he represented it viz a  Divine Attribute  "Ye shall become  as gods knowing Good and Evil  " so that in this one respect indeed his intelligence was  true  for the inspired historian has re∣corded also the words of God himself to the same effect  And the Lord God said Behold the man  is become  AS ONE OF US  to know Good and Evil  Chap iii  But  truth  is much more deceitful and dangerous even than  falsehood itself  when for the purpose of misleading it is maliciously blended with the latter for notwithstanding the Deceiver's flattering assurance to our first parents that  they should "not die"  yet  in the very day  as it seems  of their transgression  they heard the tremendous sentence of  misery  and  death  pronounced against them and though it was not  then  finally executed as they had reason  to expect it would according to the tenor of the Law before declared on which the judgment was founded for God never judges men  without Law  like the arbitrary princes of this world yet the said  Law  by which their lives were expressly forfeited was sufficiently ful∣filled  by the condemnation  of the trans∣gressors on the  very day  of their offence to  mortality  whereby their once  immor∣tal  bodies were rendered continually liable to  diseases injuries misery  and  death  as the bodies of all their descen∣dants have ever since been and they were no longer entitled even to the food necessary for the support of their poor  mortal  bodies without severe  labour care  and  assiduity    Cursed is the ground for thy sake  in sorrow  In sorrow  or rather  in labour  for  is the ex∣pression in the original which in the Targum is explained by another Hebrew word  signifying rather  fatigue  or  labour  than  sorrow  and as the necessity of man's  labour  was  the more immediate consequence of the earth's new pro∣pensity through the curse to bring forth thorns thistles and useless weeds it seems the most  expressive  rendering in this place and most suitable to the context in the follow∣ing verse  "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread"  In the Vulgate also it is rendered  "in laboribus"  and by Pagninus  "in labore"  The  same word  is also neces∣cessarily rendered  "Labours"  in Isaiah lviii  "and  exact all your labours  and in Proverbs v  "Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth  and  THY LABOURS  be in the house of a stranger  "  shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the fieldIn the sweat of thy face  said God to his guilty creature man  shalt thou eat bread  till thou return unto the ground  for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return  Gen iii to  These have ever since been the condi∣tions of human life and though some men who have store of worldly goods endeavour to cast away care and seem to  live in a state of opposition to this gene∣ral rule yet they only deceive them∣selves for no descendant of Adam be he ever so rich has any right  to eat the bread of idleness  nor can he do so with∣out offence against  his own soul  as well as against this universal ordinance of GodIf Providence has afforded him  wealth  and  leisure  he is accountable  for both  being only a steward  for life  after which the performance of his duty to God to his country to  his neighbours  nay to  mankind in general  his  brethren of the universe  will be strictly scruti∣nized and punished in proportion to the degree of his  wilful  neglect and disobe∣dience since nothing is more clearly revealed than that  all mankind  lie under an indispensable obligation  to improve  their talents for  all these duties  as well as to  use  them whenever there is an op∣portunity so that the man who neg∣lects to employ in these services a due  portion of that  leisure  which his rank or situation in life affords him may justly be said to mispend his  Master's time  for it is  not his own  and such an one must inevitably suffer with the  "unprofitable servant"  described in the Gospel who neglected to  improve  his  talent    Cast ye the  unprofitable ser∣vant  into outer darknessThere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Matt xxv  See the whole parable from the th verse whereby it plainly appears that mankind are laid under an indispensable necessity to im∣prove their respective  natural talents  to the best of their power for their  Lord's service  The  affluence  and  unemployed leisure  therefore of many persons whom we daily see amongst us afford no just ex∣ception to God's general ordinance con∣cerning the hard conditions of human  life It is almost too obvious to be mentioned that riches and hereditary honours procure no exemption from the most material part of that sentence viz  "to dust thou shalt return"  And that the time and manner of that  returning  to the  dust  or to the  ground  is  equally unknown  to the rich and to the poor though to both  equally certain  so that no man not the greatest or most inde∣pendent can claim even a single day beforehand as his own  I will say to my soul  saith the rich man in the pa∣rable  Soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry But God said unto him Thou fool  THIS NIGHT THY SOUL SHALL BE REQUIRED OF THEE  then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided  Luke xii  Wherefore with respect also to the other part of the punishment for  the original sin  viz the doom  to labour  let those  men who think themselves exempted by their rank and fortunes from the  necessity  of employment who think they have a right to  spend their time  as well as  their money  just as they please for their own amusement and mere selfsa∣tisfaction and seem to enjoy  leisure  and  ease  as if God's general ordinance to all mankind had been partial or of none effect Let such men I say be reminded of the alarming dreadful sentence pro∣nounced by "the  Lord of the vineyard  " in the parable  Behold these three years I come  seeking fruit  on this figtree and  find none  cut it down  why cumbereth it the ground  Luke xiii    How ab∣surd therefore is  the pride  of those men who value themselves on account of  ter∣ritorial  authority whether publick or private and yet live as if the importance which they assume in right of  landed pos∣sessions  or  hereditary rank in life  might of  itself be esteemed a sufficient merit with∣out the cultivation of any other But let them remember that there is a  Lord of the vineyard  "The Lord most High is terrible he is  a great King over all the earth  "  Psal xlvii    to whom all things belong  For though  God hath given the earth  to the children of men Psal cxv yet "the EARTH IS THE LORD'S and the fulness thereof the world and they that dwell therein Psal xxiv  and to whom a strict account must be rendered of every  trust  For  the kingdom of heaven is  as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods And unto one he gave five talents to another two" c "After a long time  the Lord of those servants cometh  and reckoneth with them" c Matth xxv to Give an account  of thy stewardship  for thou mayest be no longer steward Luke xvi  and of every  possession  whether of lands or of governments so that the dominions and estates of  all temporal lords and land∣owners  be their right of tenure ever so unexceptionable among men are yet so far from being  their own  that even they themselves whenever they acquire a habit of  mispending  their  time  and  wealth  are justly esteemed as INCUMBRANCES upon that very  ground  in which all their  imaginary consequence  is planted Now shall we envy the rich man's enjoyment of  unemployed leisure  if this be the con∣sequence Far better had it been for such a person to have endured with the meanest labourer the common lot of man and in the  sweat of his face to have eat his bread  Gen iii  than thus to have lived an unworthy exception to  the gene∣ral decree  thereby rendering himself in the sight of God as one that  cumbereth the ground  It would be well for mankind if  the consideration of this sen∣tence  might be esteemed also a  general Principle of Action  but alas we are all too apt to mispend our time in some degree yet it is a failing to which the rich are more particularly liable They are not compelled by necessity like other men to think for themselves and  from thence a fatal inconsiderate notion is too apt to prevail among them viz that  their time is their own  and there∣fore as they presume upon a supposed right to spend their  leisure  according to their own  Will and Pleasure  they neces∣sarily mispend their  substance  also for which they are  equally accountable  and as riches are also the ordinary means of procuring the sweets and enjoyments of life they are consequently a continual source of temptation as well to acquire them  unjustly  as to expend them  impro∣perly  From hence probably arises the extreme danger of  riches  to the spiritual welfare of mankind  Verily I say unto you said our Lord that  a rich man  shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven And again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle then for  a rich man  to enter into the kingdom of GOD  Matth xix  Go  to now ye  rich men  weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you  James v    Son remem∣ber that thou in thy lifetime re∣ceivedst thy  good things  and likewise Lazarus  evil things  but now he is comforted and thou art tormented  Luke xvi  It is nevertheless through  the additional faculty  beforementioned which human nature acquired by the transgression of our first parents viz  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  that  Sin  is imputed to us whether we be rich or poor  Our  spiritual Enemy  envied the hap∣piness of mankind in their original state and therefore artfully led them to the criminal usurpation of  forbidden Know∣ledge  that they might thereby be ren∣dered accountable to THE ETERNAL JUDGE for all their thoughts words and actions and  through Knowledge  be∣come  guilty before GOD and continually subject to  Sin  and  Death  For this  divine Knowledge  obliges us howsoever we act to  approve  at least of virtuous actions and to  condemn  vice so that when men transgress it is for the most part  knowingly  or  wilfully  and as  the strength of Sin is the Law  The sting of death is sin  and the strength of sin is the Law  But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ  Cor xv    so the  guilt  of every criminal action is  with justice  imputed to us because we have  wilfully  offended against this  natural Light or  LAW in our hearts by which we ought to have known how  to re∣fuse the evil and chuse the good  Isa vii  The Gentiles without the knowledge of Scripture nevertheless acknowledged this principle "Law" according to Cicero  is a  supreme Reason  planted in  nature which commands what  ought to be done  and  prohibits the contrary  " and he affirms that "the same  Reason  when it is established and perfected in the mind of man is  Law  "Lex" says he in his first Book  de Legibus    est  Ratio summa insita in Na∣turâ  quae jubet ea quae facienda sunt prohibetque contraria Eadem  Ratio  cum est in hominis mente confirmata et confecta  Lex est  See Tom of his Works p  Hamburgh Edition    Here the enlightened Heathen writer plainly acknowledges the  Principle  as  natural to Mankind    Ratio summa  insita in Naturâ  and yet esteemed it at the same time  a divine Attribute  by some means imparted from GOD  recta et  a numine Deorum tracta  Ratio  though he might probably be  unacquainted with the occasion of its being engraffed in Human Nature He mentions this Attribute again in his second Book  de Natura Deorum  where he speaks of Prudence or the  choice of Good and rejection of Evil  as a  univer∣sal Law  common to God  and Man  Sequitur ut  eadem  sit in his quae in genere humano  ratio eadem veritas  utrobique sit  eademque Lex  quae est  recti praeceptio pravique depulsio  Ex quo intelligitur  prudentiam  quoque  et mentem á Diis ad homines pervenisse  c  Tom p  And in his first Book  de Officiis  he more particularly defines the  Law of Nature  in Man by describing the double bias of soul viz  Appetite  and  Reason  and instead of laying down Ap∣petite or the  Pursuit of Happiness  as  the Rule of Obedience  which some very emi∣nent and learned lawyers have done he wisely reverses that rule and thence  forms an unexceptionable  Rule of Action  viz that Reason must rule but Appetite obey See his own words  Duplex est enim vis animorum atque naturae una pars in  appetitu  posita est quae est  Graecè quae hominem huc et illuc rapit altera  in ratione  quae docet et explanat quid  faciendum fugiendumque sit  Ita fit ut  Ratio  praesit  Appetitus  vero obtemperet  Tom p  He also clearly describes this natural instinct  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  under the title of Common Sense  "Communis Intelligentia"  and lays it down as the  Law  or  Rule  of  Nature "Naturae Norma"  for distinguishing  good Laws  What a profitable and convenient reduction might be made in the bulk and number of our  Statute Books  especially of the later volumes upon a revisal conducted strictly according to this excellent rule  from bad  right  from  wrong  and  honourable  from  base  which  certainly is a much safer  Principle  to rely on than  "Selflove"  Atqui nos Legem  bonam à mala  nulla alia nisi  Naturae Norma  dividere possumus Nec solùm  jus  et  injuria  à natura dijudicatur sed omnino omnia honesta ac turpia Nam et COM∣MUNIS INTELLIGENTIA nobis notas res efficit easque in animis nostris in∣choavit ut  honesta  in virtute ponantur in vitiis  turpia  Haec autem in  Opi∣nione  existimare non in  Natura  posita dementis est  De Legibus Lib Tom p  Hamburgh Edition  And the Apostle Paul has also given a strong testimony concerning the power and influence of this instinct or  first Principle  planted in  human Nature  He informs us that some men who had not the written Law of God were  nevertheless capable of doing  by Nature  or Instinct the things contained in the Law  For when the Gentiles which have not the Law do  by Nature  the things contained in the Law these  having not the Law are a Law unto themselves  We find a remarkable instance of the  Natural Dictates of Conscience  in the behaviour of  Tubourai Tamaide  a poor uninstructed inhabitant of the re∣mote island of Otaheite when he was unjustly charged with stealing a knife The story is related in the account of Capt Cook's voyage Vol p and the singularity of the circumstances leads the writer to the following remark  Upon this occasion it may be observed  says he  that these people have a  Knowledge  of RIGHT and WRONG from the mere dictates of  Natural Con∣science  and voluntarily condemn themselves when they do that to others which they would condemn others for doing to them That Tubourai Tamaide felt the force of  Moral Obligation  is  certain  for the imputation of an action which he considered as indifferent would not when it appeared to be groundless have moved him with such excess of passion  But to what shall we impute the lamentable  Change  of PRINCIPLE in the same person who was afterwards on another occasion absolutely  convicted of theft  May not the licentious ex∣ample of the English whose criminal indulgences among the poor Indian women proved that they had no fixed  regard for that pure religion which they professed have occasioned the corruption of the poor Heathen's morals and natural Principles of Virtue He was certainly be∣come a worse man by his acquaintance with them  which  shew  the work  of the Law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness  or the conscience witnessing with them  and their thoughts the mean while  or between themselves  accusing or else excusing one another c  Ro∣mans ii  This necessarily implies a  natural Knowledge of  GOOD  and  EVIL so that this  divine faculty  or instinct in  the Na∣ture of Man  seems plainly to be the grand  Principle  whereby men  who have  not the Law are a Law unto them∣selves  Rom ii  And this I ap∣prehend to be properly  THE LAW OF NATURE  in  MAN  the Law written on our hearts  or the  Conscience  which bears witness with us as the Apostle declares  in the following verseOur  thoughts the mean while  accusing  or else  ex∣cusing us  for there are few men so bad as not to have been at some time or other sensible of remorse through the accusation abovementioned of  their their thoughts  or  Conscience  For what are these  thoughts  which  accuse  and  excuse  but  Conscience  itself that is the very same  Principle  only differently expressed by the Apostle for the sake of explana∣tion And again this  Conscience  which  bears witness  is not  a different  or  distinct Principle  from  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  but only another name or mode of expressing  the same Principle  or if it be so defined by some writers as to appear in any degree  different  or  distinct  from the latter it cannot at most be otherwise esteemed than as a  different effect  of that same  Divine Knowledge  and the like may be said of  Sinderesis    as well as of  the Law of  Reason  both of which some authors have treated as  distinct Principles  from  Conscience  notwithstanding that all these separate heads  Sinderesis Reason  and  Conscience  are necessarily resolved into one single principle or foundation viz  "the Knowledge of Good and Evil"  to which the enquirer is naturally led in attempting to define them for indeed this same identical  Principle  or  Power

created  Cap  De  Ratione Quando primus Homo creatus est  percepit duplicem à Deo oculum Exteriorem sci∣licet et Interiorem Exteriorem carnis quo visibilia cerneret Et interiorem  Rationis  quo

Thus Englished in the Edi∣tions of and Chap Of Reason  When the first Man Adam was created  he received of GOD a double eye that is to say an outward eye whereby he might see visible things and know his bodily ene∣mies  and eschew them and an inward eye that is the eye of reason whereby he might see his spiritual enemies that fight against his soul and beware of them  c  " a doctrine which certainly is erroneous  That our first parents received from God when they were first created a due proportion of  Reason  suited to their original condition is not to be doubted but there is no authority whatever to warrant the supposition of their being at first indued with that  Perfection of Reason  that Attribute of a  Divine and Spiritual Nature  which afterwards became  natural  to Man though the worthy author apparently means this supreme degree of  Reason  when he tells us that Man by the gift of Reason is  made like to the dignity of angels  per quam etiam  Angelicam imitatur dignitatem  à falso discernendo verum et à bono malum Quam∣obrem valde à sua degenerat origine quoties  veritatem discernere negligit  atque  malum bono  preponit  Ibid c  discerning truth from falsehood and  Evil  from  Good  whereas it appears  very plainly from the Scriptures that this Perfection of Reason was afterwards acquired by unlawfully eating the fruit of  the Tree of Knowledge  for it is plain that the desire of  acquiring Knowledge  was part of the temptation to trangress "a  tree to be desired to make one wise  " said the deluded Woman and it was not until they had both of them eaten the forbidden fruit that God said  Be∣hold the Man  is become  AS ONE OF US to  know Good and Evil  Gen iii  thereby plainly alluding to the  Knowledge then newly acquired  by the for∣bidden fruit and they were driven out of the garden we are expressly told to prevent a further  acquisition  to the Na∣ture of Man viz  lest  he put forth his hand and  take  ALSO of the tree of Life and eat and live for ever  and therefore it is certain that Man was not enlightened by the Divine  Law of Reason  within himself when he was  first  created  or at least not with so great a share of it as has since been justly attributed to Human Nature  The third article which I have before mentioned as a principle necessarily in∣cluded in that divine Knowledge of  Good and Evil  which our first parents unlaw∣fully took upon themselves is CON∣SCIENCE and the ingenious author of Doctor and Student before quoted in describing the meaning of the word  Conscience  has accordingly explained it exactly as if he had been defining the true purpose of the former  Principle  the  Divine Knowledge of Good and Evil  So God  says he  has placed  Con∣science  in the midst of the rational soul as a light by which it should discern what it  ought to do  or ought not to do  Sic Deus posuit  Conscientiam  in medio animae rationalis tanquam Lumen quo discernet quid facere vel non facere debeat  Doct et Stud c    This is exactly the  purpose of  "the Knowledge of Good and Evil"  viz that we should use it  as a light to discern what we  ought to do  or  ought not  to do  or in Scripture words that we  may  know  to refuse the Evil and choose the Good  Isa vii  and again in the th verse  From what has been said it must ap∣pear that  Conscience Reason  and  Sinde∣resis  though sometimes treated as  distinct Principles  are nevertheless essentially founded on one  Great Principle  viz the  Divine Knowledge of  GOOD  and  EVIL and when our first parents contrary to the commands of God took  that Know∣ledge  upon themselves the immediate effects of it were the most pungent work∣ings of  Conscience  They were  conscious  of their disobedience to God  Conscious  of their shame and nakedness  Conscious  that the Divine Justice must pursue them so that they would have even hid  themselves had it been possible from the presence of their Almighty Crea∣tor But how vain was the attempt to fly from God's universal presence  The universal presence of God is most elegantly described by the Psalmist  Oh whither shall I go from thy spirit or whither shall I flee from thy presence If I ascend up into heaven thou art there If I make my bed in hell behold thou art there If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea  even there  shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me If I say  surely the darkness shall cover me  even the night shall be light about me" that is with re∣spect to God's knowledge of my thoughts and actions  yea the darkness hideth not from thee  c See the whole th Psalm O Lord thou hast searched me and known me c  when they could not even separate them∣selves from the anxious warnings and forebodings  even of  their own  Consci∣ences  For  Conscience  maintained its new habitation in their throbbing breasts attending them in their most secret re∣tirement with a stinging remembrance of their disobedience and ingratitude And as the wilful taking of  Conscience  upon themselves was the cause of all  their  misery  so the effect of that  one fault  was the entailing  Sin  and  Death  on all their descendants who by  the Laws of Nature  must necessarily partake of that  Nature  which their parents so un∣happily assumed for thus  by  one Man Sin  entered into the world  as we are informed by the great Apostle of the Gentiles  and  Death  by  Sin  and so  Death  passed upon  all Men    in or through whom  all have sinned For until  the Law  that is even before  the written Law of Moses    Sin was in the world  Also  Also  or  moreover  The original word is  which in this place on account of the context seems more intelligible if rendered  also  than  "but"  which latter is the common version  Sin  is not imputed when there is  no Law But  But  seems better to express the meaning of  in this place than the common rendering  nevertheless  which gives a different turn to the sense  Death  reigned from  Adam to Moses  even over them who had not sinned after the similitude of  Adam's transgression c  Rom v to  Apparently meaning that as  Death  which was the effect and punishment of  imputed Sin    reigned  from Adam to Moses  that is  "until the Law"  so we ought to conclude that some sort of  Law  previous to that of Moses preceded  Sin  as  Sin  preceded  Death  viz  as Sin hath reigned unto Death  see ver for otherwise  Death  could not have  reigned  before the  written Law  and conse∣quently  the Law  to be understood by which  "Sin entered into the world"  and by which  "Death passed upon all"  and  "reigned from Adam to Moses"  was the  Law  of internal  Knowledge  or  Consci∣ence  by which  all Men  from the time of our first parents Christ alone ex∣cepted are convicted  Sinners  For as the  Ways of Man  are not equal to his assumed  Knowledge  he is thereby ren∣dered  guilty  and obnoxious to  the eternal  Justice  of GOD  in whose sight shall no man living be justified  Psal cxliii  Hence a temporal DEATH or depar∣ture from this world is not the only fruit of  Sin  but there is also a  certain fearful looking for of judgment  and  fiery in∣dignation c  Hebrews x  the  sense  of which is so deeply im∣printed on the human  Conscience  that even the most hardened offender is at some time or other affected with it otherwise  Sin  could not be esteemed  "the Sting of Death"  For if the na∣tural light of  Human Reason  would per∣mit men to indulge themselves with a positive assurance that  Death  is really the last period or  final dissolution  of their  existence  the  Consciousness of Sin  would not encrease  the Fear of Death  and could not therefore with propriety be esteemed  "the Sting of Death" Death  is indeed the King of Terrors and Na∣ture shrinks at its approach But the anguish of the guilty and unbelieving soul springs from a deeper source than  Death  viz the dread of what must follow it This is a further effect of  Reason  and  Human Knowledge  for though a man refuses to be bound by the eternal Laws of  Reason  yet  Reason  will inform him of his  guilt  and  its deserts  and vindicate her injured  Laws  by  dreadful expectation  for the very Devils believe and tremble James ii  Horrible gloom when  Reason  sees no ground for hopeThus  Conscience  though not obeyed is  Conscience  still and a time we know  will surely come  when men shall  begin to say to the mountains  fall on us  and to the hills  cover us  See also Revelation vi  And  the Kings of the Earth  and the great men and the rich  men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every  bondman  and  every freeman  for all will be equal in that tremendous day  hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said  Fall on us and hide us  from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the  wrath of the Lamb  for the great  day of his wrath is come  and who shall be able to stand  Luke xxiii  Death  therefore it is manifest is not the  only  object of the sinner's fear or men would never seek  a hidingplace  in what must be their  graves  by wishing to  be buried  under the very mountains and hills with the vain hope of secreting themselves from the wrath to come And who is free from sinIn the sight of God  shall no man living be justified  Psa cxliii  And  with∣out shedding of  BLOOD  is no remission  Heb ix  Wherefore it is mani∣fest that the BLOOD of every man is for∣feited before GodBut the Almighty was graciously pleased to accept the BLOOD of animals probably as an acknow∣ledgment of that forfeiture and as a  type of a future and more effectual re∣demption to atone for human guilt  For the life of the flesh  said God to Moses  is in the  BLOOD  and I have given it to you upon the altar  TO MAKE AN ATONEMENT  for your souls  for  it is the  BLOOD  that maketh an  ATONE∣MENT  for the  SOUL  Lev xvii  But as the  Necessity of Redemption  is thus obvious so the  means of obtaining it  has been as clearly revealed and therefore the same innate  Knowledge of Good and Evil  which has rendered us obnoxious to GOD'S  Eternal Justice  through disobedience will lead us if we use it as we ought to repentance and amendment and consequently to reconciliation and eternal happiness through that more effectual propitiation and redemption to which all mankind are invited by the Redeemer himself who is  the  WAY  and the Truth and the Life  as  no man cometh unto  the Father but by  him  John xiv  For if through  the offence of  ONE  our first parent Adam  MANY be  dead  much more the grace of God and the gift by grace  which is  by ONE  Man Jesus Christ  hath abounded unto MANY And not as  it was  by  one  that sinned  so is  the gift  for the judgment was  by  one  to condemna∣tion but the free gift  is  of  many  offences unto justification  c See the contrast as carried on by the Apostle Paul in the th chapter of his Epistle to the Romans  Men seldom fall indeed into any very gross  offence  against the  Eternal Law  till they are  initiated  as it were by lesser crimes and have gradually stifled the natural restraint of the  innate Knowledge  or  Conscience  before described and then they are no longer worthy to be called  Men  being more properly  Brutes  be∣cause  Conscience  or the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  which should distinguish the  Nature of Men  from  Brutes  doth no longer influence their actions  The state indeed of such unhappy men is worse than that of brutes be∣cause there is still another capital dis∣tinction in their nature which wicked men cannot cast off as they do  Consci∣ence  they have a  living Soul  which must inevitably be accountable for  all their actions  as I have before remarked and therefore when they prefer the temporal gratification of their passions whether of  Pride Love of unlimited Power Avarice Lust Hatred  or  Selfish∣ness  to the eternal welfare of their souls they may be said to  sell themselves for nought  because all unlawful passions are increased instead of being satisfied by indulgence so that there is  no Bondage  so wretched as that of  Sin    They allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean or for a little escaped from them who live in error While they promise them  Liberty  they themselves are the  Ser∣vants  or  Slaves  of  Corruption  for of whom a man is  overcome  of the same is he brought in  Bondage  Pet ii  See also the remainder of the same chapter for the lamentable consequences of that  wretched Bondage  the  Service  of Sin    no Slave  so truly miserable as the man who is  a Slave to his Passions  Whosoever committeth Sin is the  Servant  or Slave of  Sin  John viii    For the truth of this conclusion no further or better proof can be ex∣pected than our Saviour's authority  Dr Jackson Book Ch  And there∣fore when we are endeavouring to trace out  the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Men  it would be unrea∣sonable to search for it  among Slaves  I mean those that are  Slaves  to their passions because such MEN  are not their own masters  and consequently are not worthy the name of MEN It would be neither just nor charitable to draw  our conclusions concerning the  Nature of Man  from that depraved state of  Hu∣man Nature  wherein the proper and  natural distinction  of  Manhood the  KNOW∣LEDGE  of  GOOD  and  EVIL which we  naturally  inherit from our first parents has lost its influence  No MAN indeed is  perfect neither are  ALL MEN  depraved  and though the  depraved  state of man may perhaps be  most general  it certainly is not  uni∣versal  and therefore  the universal Principle of Action in Man  is not to be drawn from thence But it will be still much more profitable for us to re∣member when any  Rule of Obedience  is proposed as an  universal Principle of Action  that it is not so much our business or interest to trace out what REALLY IS  "the universal Principle of Action"  as what it OUGHT TO BE I have already produced the testimony of the most  learned and able lawyer among the Hea∣thens that  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  is an  universal Principle natural  to mankind and he so far esteems it as  "a Rule of Obedience"  that he lays it down as the foundation of  Law  For Law says he again in another place is nothing else but  right and divinely inspired Reason commanding what is ho∣nest  and  forbidding the contrary  Est enim  Lex  nihil aliud nisi RECTA et à  nu∣mine Deorum tracta  RATIO imperans honesta prohi∣bens contraria  Oratio Philippica Vol p  But a modern though very learned and respectable law commentator has re∣ferred us to a different Principle as a  "Rule of Obedience"  which is very liable to be misunderstood he informs us in page vol that the Creator  has graciously reduced the Rule of Obe∣dience to this  one paternal Precept That Man should pursue his own Hap∣piness  "This" says he  is the  foundation of what we call Ethics or natural Law  Yet in justice to the worthy author it must be allowed that the Happiness which he speaks of is not  selfish partial  or  sensual Happiness  for that would be a very improper sub∣ject for a  "paternal Precept"  but  real Happiness  and  substantial Happi∣ness  as he further expresses himself in the same page and no Happiness can be  "real"  or  "substantial"  which is not lasting so that it is plain this emi∣nent writer means that  lasting  and  sub∣stantial Happiness  alone which arises from Obedience to the will of God for the Knowledge of which he refers us at the same time to the Holy Scriptures See the following page  Yet even such  "substantial Happiness"  can only be called an  effect  of which a conscientious Obedience to the will of God is  one of the causes  but the  primary  cause or motive  to that Obedience in  good Men  is still different from both and yet none of them can be the  proper foun∣dation  of Ethics or  natural Law  The learned author has himself as∣signed a more probable foundation in the preceding page to which perhaps he might mean to refer by the prono∣minal adjective  "This"  in the sentence which immediately follows his  one paternal Precept  viz  This  is the foundation of what we call Ethics or natural Law  for he observes in p that  CONSIDERING the Creator only as a Being of infinite  Power  he was able unquestionably to have pre∣scribed whatever Laws he pleased to his creature Man however unjust or severe But as he is also a Being of infinite  Wisdom  he has laid down only such Laws as were  founded  in  those relations of Justice  that existed in the nature of things antecedent to  any positive PreceptTHOSE RE∣LATIONS of JUSTICE  then on which the  other Laws are founded  are properly THE FOUNDATION And "these" the learned writer himself tells us in the following sentence  are the eternal immutable  LAWS  of  GOOD  and  EVIL to which the Creator him∣self in all his dispensations conforms and which he has enabled  Human Reason  to discover so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions  Thus THE FOUNDATION is clearly laid down and there is no oc∣casion to assign any other  Motive of Obe∣dience  to the several Laws on  this Foun∣dation  than what is mentioned in the same sentence viz  Human Reason  by which men are enabled to discover  these eternal and immutable Laws of  Good and Evil  For  the Knowledge  of what  is Good  or what  is Evil  is surely a sufficient Motive for  chusing  the one and  rejecting  the other because  Good  when known is as truly amiable in itself as  Evil  is detestable and fright∣ful so that the former most naturally engages our preference without any other Motive than this  natural Knowledge  of their respective qualities  Sinister Motives do nevertheless too frequently prevail through the extreme frailty of  Human Nature  which engages the greater part of mankind in the pur∣suit of temporal Interest or partial and sensual Happiness  So that if the learned commentator had mentioned  Selflove  as the  general  instead of the  universal Principle of Action  I should not have thought myself obliged to have taken particular notice of that part of his work  Several reasons may be assigned why it cannot be admitted as the  universal Principle of Action  And first Because the most worthy actions as I have already observed are frequently occasioned by a more generous motive than  Selflove  Secondly Because  bad  men are some∣times prompted to  good  actions through the influence of their own  natural Know∣ledge of Good and Evil  when the occa∣sion happens not to interfere with their particular views of private Interest or their predominant Passions  A more remarkable instance of this perhaps was never known than what my own grandfather experienced in his acquaintance with the  Lord Chancellor Jefferies  who was perhaps the most abandoned timeserver of those days if we except his companion in iniquity  Ge∣neral Kirk  It would not have been possible  says Rapin speaking of Chancellor Jefferies  and  General Kirk "for him"  King James the IId  to have found in the kingdom two men more void of all Religion of all Honour aad all Humanity They were two tigers chafed with blood who had no pleasure but in carnage  Tom p    Dr Sharp  was as totally different and  opposite to the  Chancellor  in every part of his character as it was possible for any man to be yet the  Chancellor  entertained a very particular regard and esteem for him He treated the Doctor very roughly indeed when he had received his Royal Master's orders to prosecute him for  preaching against Popery  but in every other point which did not interfere with his  timeserving principles  and  poli∣ticks  he was always ready to shew favour and kindness to Dr Sharp whenever he had an opportunity and happy it was for him that he did so for afterwards in the time of his distress when a  just retribution  of worldly trouble overtook him insomuch that he was not only a prisoner expecting in his turn a  severe execution of the Laws  for his  injustice  and  cruelty  but also grievously afflicted with the stone and other diseases in consequence of his former intemperance Dr Sharp was the only person who afforded him any comfort in his misery for he regularly visited the unhappy man in his confinement and used his best endeavours to alleviate his distress and prepare him for another world by advice and exhortation  for if this was not the case it is obvious  considering the great multitude of  selfish  men in comparison of the  Just  that society could not exist  And thirdly Because  bad  actions which most abound manifestly tend even in the opinion of the offenders themselves to defeat the most essential purposes of  Selflove  for the most hard∣ened  sinners are conscious through their innate  Knowledge of Good and Evil  that their unlawful temporary gratifications tend to deprive them of their  "real"  and  "substantial  happiness" viz  Eternal Salvation  for if they had not this  Con∣sciousness of Evil  there could be no such thing as presumptuous sin  Selflove  however under proper re∣strictions is certainly a main branch of  the Law of Nature  and though it can∣not be admitted as the  universal Prin∣ciple of Action  is nevertheless an  uni∣versal Principle  but it cannot be ad∣mitted as a  "Rule of Obedience"  because there are many occasions when it ought to be superseded by more noble Motives to  Action  The  Knowledge of Good and Evil  is also an  universal Principle in Man  though it is still much farther from being  the  universal Principle of Action  than  "Selflove"  and indeed my present at∣tempt is not to prove  what is  the  uni∣versal Principle of Action  but only what  it ought to be  as I before remarked being convinced that  the one paternal Precept  laid down by the learned Law Commentator though certainly with good intentions and probably with good authority from other Law Writers as the  "Rule of Obedience"  viz  that we  should pursue our own Happiness  is very defective because the very  Rule  itself requires a multitude of other  Rules  to restrain it within due bounds and curb the  Selflove  of individuals for the benefit of society  Nothing is so liable to be misunder∣stood as  "our own Happiness"  for when  Self  alone is the object  Selflove  can imply nothing but  Partiality  and  Selfpreference  so that such  a Rule of Obe∣dience  is liable to afford a handle of excuse for actions of mere  Selfgratifica∣tion  to which the learned and worthy author or perhaps rather the adopter of the hypothesis would be entirely averse a  Slaveholder  for instance might al∣ledge that he  pursues his own Hap∣piness  by extorting the unwilling service of other men because he is thereby enabled to maintain himself and family not only comfortably but ele∣gantly and that the maintenance and support of the sugar islands and conse∣quently the happiness of his wealthy neighbours depends upon the employ∣ing of slaves so that  social benefits  do also arise from it and he will likewise alledge that he is obliged by  Selflove  to persist in the measure be∣cause he cannot maintain the same  Hap∣piness  and comfort by any other means so that he does not act contrary to  the Law of Nature  or the  "Rule of  Obedience"  as laid down by the most eminent writers on the subject  Thus the  "paternal Precept"  as it is called of pursuing our own  Happiness  may lead men to form a false estimate of  necessity  or what they may think them∣selves  obliged to undertake  from their particular situation in life and will afford them the like excuse for any other vice on which a man's temporal sub∣sistence depends  It is therefore an  oblique Rule  which insensibly declines into mere  Selfgrati∣fication  or private Interest which is the bane of Equity and Justice so that  Selflove  can no otherwise be admitted  as a Rule  than for the purpose of measuring the due proportion of  that Love which we owe to the rest of Mankind  agreeable to a real  "paternal Precept"  that will  never deceive us  Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself  Lev xix  This excellent maxim of the  Old Law  is strongly enforced and recommended in the New Testament which shall hereafter be shewn nay the very Hea∣thens it seems were not entirely igno∣rant of this  Divine Precept  for the favourite maxim of the Emperor  Alex∣ander Severus  was much to the same effect according to the report of Lam∣pridius quoted by the learned Joseph Mede Book p viz  Quod tibi fieri nonvis alteri ne feceris"  "Do not to another what you would not have done to yourself  Neither has the doctrine been overlooked by the writers on  the Law of Nature  Hobbes very judiciously refers us  to this Rule of Obedience  for the easy knowledge of what  the Law of Nature  dictates  When a Man  doubts  says he  whether what he is going to do to another be agreeable to the  LAW OF NATURE  let him suppose himself in the others room  For by this means  continues he  when  Selflove  and the other passions which weighed down one scale are taken thence and put into the contrary scale it is easy to guess which way the balance will turn  And Baron Puffendorf  Law of Nature and Nations as translated by Basil Kennet Oxford p  remarks thereupon that  this is no other than the great rule prescribed by our Saviour himself of  doing to Men as we would be done by  The learned Baron nevertheless re∣marks in the following paragraph  that this Precept cannot be esteemed  a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature  since it is only a corollary of  that Law which obliges us  to hold all Men equal with ourselves  and therefore may be demonstrated  à pri∣ori  But howsoever it may be capable of being demonstrated yet this is no just objection to  Hobbes  's excellent rule for knowing  what the Law of Na∣ture dictates  especially as the learn∣ed objector seems afterwards to have sought  in vain  for a more  fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature  for I cannot find that any thing he has afterwards proposed is at all worthy to be compared with it either as  a Foundation  or a  "Rule of Obedience"  Nevertheless in justice to the learned Baron I must observe that he has well defended this  general Rule  against the objection of  Dr Sharrock  Dr Sharrock is of opinion  says he  that this rule is not universal  because if so a judge must needs absolve the criminals left to his sen∣tence inasmuch as he would certainly spare his own life were he in their place I must needs give a poor peti∣tioner what sum soever he desires because I should wish to be thus dealt with if I was in his condition or I must clean my servants shoes be∣cause I require him to clean mine  But the rule  says the learned Baron  will still remain unshaken if we observe that  not  ONE  Scale only but  BOTH  are to be considered  or that I am not only to weigh and examine what is agreeable to me but likewise what obligation or necessity lies on the other person and what I can de∣mand of him without injuring either of our duties  Book Chap p  Neither does the Baron's own objec∣tion which immediately follows in the least affect the propriety of  Hobbes  's rule  for the easy Knowledge of what the Law of Nature dictates  for though the nature of a  Rule  or  Principle  of  Doctrine  differing from  active Princi∣ples  be such as to induce the necessity of supposing a  prior Principle  or Instinct in man whereby he may be enabled to suggest adopt approve or obey this or any other  Rule  which seems to be the reason of the Baron's refusing to acknow∣ledge this excellent rule as  a funda∣mental Axiom of the Law of Na∣ture  yet the learned Baron himself has multiplied the difficulty by assign∣ing still another  Rule  or mere  Principle of Doctrine  viz the  holding all Men equal with ourselves  as the foundation of this  Rule  instead of a  real first Cause  such as the  immediate Inspiration of God  the  Revelation of his Will in the Scriptures  or the  natural and divine Instinct of  KNOWING GOOD  and  EVIL For whe∣ther  the Precept  is inculcated and made known to Man by  Divine Revelation  immediate or scriptural or merely by the  natural Instinct  in Man of  knowing Good and Evil  it may nevertheless be justly esteemed  a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature  The Jews and Christians indeed are taught the value and importance of  this Precept  by the Holy Scriptures yet this is not the only means of its being known and received among men as  a Rule of Obedience  for besides the example which I have already given concerning the Emperor Alexander Se∣verus it appears that the Gentiles in every part of the world have demon∣strated a sense of this Precept without the  assistance of Scripture  not only the ancient Greeks and Romans but the  remote inhabitants of China and Ame∣rica of which a few examples are here subjoined from the additional notes of the translator of Puffendorf p viz  Aristotle  in Diogenes Laertius Lib Segm  being asked how we ought to behave ourselves towards our friends answered  as we wish they would behave themselves towards us  Lib tom  Quod quis juris in alterum c  Seneca de Ira Lib c  Let us suppose ourselves in the same circumstances as the person with whom we are angry That which now puts us in a passion is only the wrong opinion and estimate of ourselves We are unwilling to  SUFFER  what we are willing to  DO  'Tis a saying of  Con∣fucius  in Marcinus's Hist Sin Lib c  Never do to another what you are unwilling to suffer from him  The same Precept was made use of by  Ynca Manco Capac  the founder of  the  Peruvian  empire in order to the reducing his subjects to a life of civility  De la Vega L c  Thus it appears that not only the  Heathen nations  of  Europe  but also the distant uninformed inhabitants of  China  and  America  were endued by their innate  Knowledge of Good and Evil  with general ideas of that most excellent Precept which CHRIST himself has de∣clared to be the  true Christian  RULE OF ACTION and which therefore may justly be esteemed  a fundamental  Axiom of  the Law of Nature  viz  All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for  this is the Law and the Prophets  Matt vii See also Luke vi The meaning and appa∣rent intention of this GOLDEN RULE is exactly the same in effect as the other great commandment of the Law  Thou  shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  so that all persons who carefully examine these and other parallel texts must neces∣sarily be convinced that the command  to love our neighbour as ourselves  is the  ONE PATERNAL PRECEPT  or rather I should say the ONLY  PATERNAL PRECEPT to which the  Creator has graciously reduced the Rule of Obedience  since by the highest authority we are assured that the equitable rule of  doing to others  as we would that men should do unto us  or in short to love our neighbour  as ourselves  IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS  which im∣plies as much as if our Lord had said This is the Spirit or FIRST PRIN∣CIPLE OF LAW and contains  the Sum and Essence of all other Laws  The testi∣mony of the Apostle Paul is nearly to the same effect  For  ALL THE LAW  says he  is fulfilled in  ONE WORD  even in this  THOU SHALT LOVE THY  NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF  Gal v  Which might well be paraphrased as follows  ALL THE LAW IS FUL∣FILLED IN ONE WORD  for  the Creator    has graciously reduced the Rule of Obedience to this one paternal Precept  not  that  Man should pursue his own Happiness  but  EVEN IN THIS THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF  so that no other  "paternal Precept"  can possibly be received as a  general Rule of Obedience  for all occasions except this alone which must therefore be acknow∣ledged as  the fundamental Rule  both of  Natural  and  Revealed Law  Concerning this Golden Rule of Action I have wrote a separate Tract under the title of  the Law of Liberty  or  Royal Law  to which I must beg leave to refer my readers for further remarks on that head  Having now proved I hope that this  FUNDAMENTAL AXIOM OF THE LAW OF NATURE  ought to be  THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IN MAN  I can more safely resume my discourse concerning  Principles of Action  in general It has already been shewn that  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  is  an  universal Principle  in  Man  as well as  Selflove  But I must now remark that the former has the following essential difference from  Selflove  as an  universal Principle  viz that it is never superseded like the latter by any  just Motive of  DUTY though it is often violated in breach of DUTY through human Frailty for all  just Motives of  DUTY are perfectly con∣sistent with it and influence the heart under its direction and guidance and even the most  noble Motive  to Action independent of  Inspiration  or  immediate Revelation  is so far from superseding  the natural  "Knowledge of Good and Evil"  that it may more properly be esteemed an exertion of it for instance by a due exertion of  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  we promote the  very first  Principle of  all Duty  as it is the  first  great commandment viz  The Love of God  for if we have  Know∣ledge to chuse the Good and reject the Evil  the same  Knowledge  must in∣cline us to prefer the  Author of all Good  when revealed to us and his Com∣mandments before every other conside∣ration for so Abraham's Obedience in attempting to sacrifice his son was ren∣dered acceptable to God he knew his Maker and supreme Lord by  unquestion∣able Revelation  and therefore justly concluded through his  natural  Know∣ledge of Good and Evil  that the Command of God ought to supersede all  natural Affection  and  Selflove  so that this was an  Effect of Reason  which  seemed to counteract even the  Principles of Reason itself  by dissolving all the ties  of Nature  But the Patriarch thereby gave an ample proof of a sincere Faith and of an unfeigned Love to his Creator  By  what Principle of Action  also was Moses induced though the meekest of  Men  to  remonstrate  to his Creator when the Divine Indignation was declared against the Ingratitude and Wickedness of the children of Israel in worshipping the molten calf during the time that Moses continued in the mount to receive the Law God said to Moses  I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff∣necked people now therefore  LET ME ALONE  LET ME REST  that is from your intercessions  that my wrath may wax hot against them and that I may  CONSUME THEM  and I will make of  THEE  a great nation  Exod xxxii  Now if  "Selflove"  had been  "the universal Principle of Action"  Moses would not have declined the acceptance of such a distinguished honour when tendered to him even by the ALMIGHTY LORD OF THE UNIVERSE whose right of disposal could not justly be called in question But the faithful minister of the Israelitish commonwealth did not seem to entertain the least sense of that imaginary  "paternal Precept"  mentioned above  that Man should pursue his own Happiness  for his answer on that occasion proves that he was actuated by a  Principle  infinitely superior to  Selflove  I mean a true and unfeigned  Zeal  for  the Glory of God  arising from a right use of  his natural discretion  or  Know∣ledge of Good and Evil  which di∣rected his choice and enabled him to set aside all consideration of SELF or private worldly Interest when he thought the circumstances of the pro∣position seemed likely to affect the ho∣nour  of GOD in the misinformed opi∣nion of the Egyptians and other Hea∣then For he  besought the Lord his God  though God had previously forbid him saying "LET ME ALONE"  and said Lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of  EGYPT  with great power and with a mighty hand Wherefore should the  EGYPTIANS  speak and say For mis∣chief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth Turn from thy fierce wrath  said  Moses  to the ALMIGHTY  and repent of this evil against thy people  And he also claimed the promise by which GOD had absolutely bound himself to the Patri∣archs  To whom  said Moses  thou swarest by thine  OWN SELF  and saidst unto them I will multiply your seed  c And the text immediately informs  us that  the  LORD  repented of the evil  which he  thought  to  do unto his people  Exod xxxii to  Thus God was pleased to manifest his regard and consideration even for  Human Judg∣ment  even for the opinion of  a mere Man  when founded on  Reason  and other  just Principles  such as mankind are capable of exerting And shall earthly monarchs then presume to despise any reasonable remonstrance of their fellow menof their equals in every other respect except that of a de∣legated office when it is apparent that even the SUPREME LORD and MAKER OF ALL THINGS has condescended to hear and graciously receive a remon∣strance from his Creature Man Nay and that repeatedly on various occasions The like remonstrance was also made by Moses when God declared his anger against Israel for murmuring at the re∣port given of the promised land and  for proposing to return into Egypt and also for attempting to stone  Joshua  and  Caleb  who had endeavoured to appease and convince them of their error See the th Chapter of Numb ver  And the  LORD  said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which I have shewed among them I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will  MAKE OF THEE    said GOD to  Moses  a great∣er nation and mightier than they  But the noble Principles far superior to  Selflove  by which that Great Mi∣nister of State generally regulated his conduct once more prevented his ac∣ceptance of the glorious promise even though tendered by his Maker His sincere regard for  the Glory of God  agreeable to the first great Commandment made him jealous that the  Heathen nations  should  falsely conceive that the LORD JEHO∣VAH was not able to bring his people the Israelites into the land which he "sware unto them" so that his  Zeal for the Glory of God  was manifestly the principal  Motive  of his answer on that occasion  And Moses said unto the Lord Then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land  for  they have heard that thou LORD  art  among this people that thou LORD  art  seen face to face and  that  thy cloud standeth over them and  that  thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night Now  if  thou shalt kill  all  this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness And now I beseech thee let the power of my LORD be great according as thou hast spoken saying The LORD is long suffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing  the guilty  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth  generation  Pardon I beseech thee the ini∣quity  of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now And the Lord said I have pardoned according to thy word  Numb xiv to  And though a  natural Affection  or brotherly Love for his  countrymen might probably be also in∣cluded as an  additional Motive  to his in∣tercession worthy our imitation yet his  "own Selflove"  was manifestly quite out of the question since he might have attained for himself the highest pitch of worldly glory without for∣feiting his  real  or eternal Happiness by such an acquisition for as the offer was made by  the God of the Spirits of all Flesh  the acceptance of it could not have been imputed to him as sinful though the contrary behaviour was ap∣parently more agreeable to the will of the Almighty who was pleased to sig∣nify his approbation of Moses's  remon∣strance  and  intercession  by declaring to him  I have pardoned according to thy word  Numb xiv to  Also upon the rebellion of Korah re∣lated in the th chapter of Numbers when God spoke to  Moses  and  Aaron  saying  Separate yourselves from among this congregation  THAT I MAY CON∣SUME THEM IN A MOMENT  Yet these two great leaders of Israel were so little actuated by that imaginary  uni∣versal Principle of Action  SELFLOVE that they were entirely regardless of their  own danger  notwithstanding the divine warning and seemed to have no other care but that of endeavouring  to save their brethren  from GOD'S wrath for it does not appear that they retreated or  separated  themselves  from among the congregation  as they were expressly directed but only  "fell upon their faces"  and exerted the powers of  Human Reason  in the following  short remonstrance  to their Maker  O GOD THE GOD  of the Spirits of all Flesh shall  ONE MAN SIN  and wilt thou be wroth with  ALL  THE CONGREGATION  Numb xvi  The  like Remonstrance  founded in sound  Reason  and  natural Equity  had once before been made even to the Al∣mighty himself by his  faithful Servant  ABRAHAM when God condescended to reveal to him the awful decree of  Divine Vengeance  against the populous cities of the plains of Sodom    Wilt thou also destroy the Righteous with the Wicked    said Abraham  And Abraham drew near and said  Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked  Peradven∣ture there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty right∣eous that are therein That be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee  shall not the Judge of all the earth do right  Gen xviii  shall not the  LORD  of all the earth  DO RIGHT  Thus a due exertion of  right Reason  demonstrated the  Dignity of Human Na∣ture  and the examples just mention∣ed sufficiently prove that THE AL∣MIGHTY requires his  Creature Man to judge of Right and Wrong  and to form and declare a sound  Judgment  upon the eternal Principles of  Justice and Right∣eousness  agreeable to that  Divine Know∣ledge  with which the  Human Mind  is most certainly endowed  Though  Abraham  and his descendants  Moses  and  Aaron  knew that they could not exist even a single moment without the immediate protection of  Divine Pro∣vidence  yet they thought it their duty to  remonstrate  even to their CREATOR on the eternal Principles of  Justice and Judgment  THE ALMIGHTY SEARCHER OF HEARTS knew beforehand what they  would say and the propriety of their future answers and therefore undoubt∣edly afforded them these extraordinary opportunities of proving to all mankind their  Knowledge of Good and Evil  as well as their  Faith  and entire dependence on the eternal  "Justice  and  Judgment"  of the  Divine  BEING that these clear ex∣amples of the  Knowledge and Dignity of Human Nature  as also of the regard and consideration which even the great Au∣thor of  that Nature  was graciously pleased to manifest on those occasions towards the mental Faculties of his Creature  Man  might be recorded to the end of time  Concerning the Spirit of  Justice  and  Judgment  with which  Abraham  was endowed God previously declared  I know him that he will command his children and his houshold after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord  to do  JUSTICE  and  JUDGMENT  c  Gen xviii  So that  Abraham  's Remonstrance wherein he appealed to "  the  JUSTICE  and  JUDGMENT"  of  GOD was apparently agreeable to the foreknowledge and expectation of the Almighty as well as the other Remon∣strance of Abraham's descendants  Moses  and  Aaron  For these extraordinary ex∣ertions of  Human Reason  in appealing to the  Divine Justice  were so far from being offensive even to THE SUPREME AND ETERNAL SOVEREIGN OF THE UNIVERSE that on the contrary he clearly manifested his  approbation  by the gracious manner in which he accepted and answered these  human petitions  He condescended to satisfy the  righteous  and  just Spirit  of ABRAHAM by an assu∣rance that even  "if ten righteous per∣sons"  only could be found amongst the wicked nations in the plains of  Sodom    I will not destroy it  said he  for  the tens sake  Gen xviii But alas by the fatal catastrophe of all the nations in the plains of Sodom soon afterwards and by the very small number of individuals that were found worthy of the divine warning to escape the  national punishment  it is apparent that there were not even  five righteous persons  to be found in  five  royal cities Gen xiv Horrible depravity  And to the Re∣monstrance of  Moses  and  Aaron  the de∣scendants of the  just  ABRAHAM the like favourable attention was paid by  the God of the Spirits of all Flesh  for as their petition was offered up in behalf of  the whole Congregation  viz that they might not suffer for the fault of one or a few persons God condescended to spare  the Congregation  though they had  justly  incurred the forfeiture of life by joining  The text informs us that  KORAH  gathered  ALL THE CONGREGATION  against them  Moses and Aaron  unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  whereby the guilt of the  congregation  is manifest Numb xvi  the haughty and factious princes of Israel in open rebellion to the Divine Ordinances contrary to the  clearest evidence of all their senses For Moses on offering up this short petition was immediately directed to separate the  Congregation  from the more notorious offenders  Speak unto the Congregation sayingGet ye up from about the taber∣nacle of  KORAH DATHAN  and  ABI∣RAM  And  MOSES  rose up and went unto  DATHAN  and  ABIRAM  and the Elders of Israel followed him And he spake unto the Congregation saying Depart I pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins  And accordingly all persons that had grace sufficient to repent of their connections with these wicked men  Gat up from the tabernacle of  Ko∣rah Dathan  and  Abiram  on every side  And immediately afterwards God was pleased to justify  Moses  and to demonstrate the truth of his Divine Mis∣sion by a tremendous and unusual exam∣ple  of  Vengeance    the ground clave asunder that  was  under them and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses  c  upon the hardened offenders and their families Numb xvi to And this being done in the presence of  the whole Congregation  then a populous  nation  the evidence of it which is handed down to us by their descendants  the Jews  and has also been confirmed from time to time by other instances of Divine  Vengeance  upon the  same nation  was thereby rendered incontestable  Nevertheless the very next day  all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying Ye have killed the people of the Lord  This further rebellion having once more provoked the Divine Justice the cloud covered the tabernacle and the glory of the Lord appeared And Moses and Aaron were once more  commanded to separate themselves from the Congregation that a  National Ven∣geance  might take place  Get you up from this Congregation  said the Al∣mighty  that I may  CONSUME THEM AS IN A MOMENT  Nevertheless these two worthy Ministers of God dis∣covered no sense of fear  for themselves  whilst the  national  danger demanded their endeavours in behalf of  their brethren  and therefore instead of separating them∣selves as they had been  once more  com∣manded they  once more  FELL UPON THEIR FACES  to implore the Di∣vine mercy and forgiveness of the  na∣tional  iniquity so that  Selflove  was manifestly superseded by  Patriotism  and  brotherly Affection  And as the plague was already begun among the people the mediation of these two men was so far favoured by  the God of Israel  that Moses was inspired with wisdom and presence of mind to instruct his Brother  Aaron  how to  make an atonement for the  people  by the burning of incense And accordingly Aaron  stood between the dead and the living and the plague was staid  Numb xvi  These are unquestionable examples to demonstrate that  "Selflove"  is not  "the universal Principle of Action"  Upon a former intercession also of Moses in behalf of his ungrateful coun∣trymen he permitted his  natural Affec∣tion  for them to carry him seemingly far beyond the bounds of  Reason  and  Moderation  in his expressions to the Almighty  And Moses returned unto the LORD and said Oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold Yet now if thou wilt for∣give their sin and if not  blot me I pray thee out of thy book  which thou hast written And the Lord said unto Moses Whosoever hath sinned against me him will  I blot out of my book  Exod xxxii  even so far as to wish that he himself might be  blotted out of  God's Book  Meaning probably an exclusion from  the tem∣poral blessings  promised in God's covenant or perhaps the  loss of life  both of which came upon him afterwards for his unguarded expressions on another occasion Compare Numb xx with Numb xxvii Deut iv and Psalm cvi  if the sin of the people was not forgiven So that  Selflove  is by no means  the universal Principle of Action  The affectionate Apostle Paul seemed also equally anxious for the eternal wel∣fare and prosperity of  the same great Na∣tion  and he expressed the like unbound∣ed Love towards them by one of the strongest  hyperbolical  expressions as Mr  Burkitt  calls it that he could possibly have chosen for that purpose  I could wish  says he  that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh  Rom ix  And though the Apo∣stle by the words  might perhaps mean to refer only to  that  anathema  of  temporal misery  and de∣struction denounced by Christ himself against Jerusalem and the unbelieving Jewish nation for their open rejection of the Gospel  Behold your house  said Christ  is left unto you desolate  Matt xxiii Luke xiii  And again  When ye therefore shall see the abomina∣tion of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him un∣derstand  said our Lord  Then let them which be  in Judea  flee unto the mountains  c  And  woe unto them  that are with child and to them that give suck in those days  c  For then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be  Matt xxiv  Under this severe ANATHEMA of  national Mi∣sery  the unconverted part of the  Jewish people  might with propriety be accounted    accursed from the Messiah  being then separated or  excommunicated  as it were from the immediate protection of  the eternal  "KING of ISRAEL" and by him publicly given up to  temporal Vengeance  the  Sufferings and Misery  of which and not the  Reprobation  which occasioned them the pa∣triotic Apostle would willingly have endured if it were possible  in his own Person  for no otherwise could he wish to be  separated from Christ  but in  Sufferings  for the  Love of Christ  was unalienableSee preceding Chapter ver to  if he could thereby have removed from his Nation this dreadful  ANATHEMA  of Christ's temporal Vengeance  which at the time the Apostle wrote was dreadfully im∣pending But whether this conjecture of mine be right or not and whether the  Anathema  mentioned by the Apostle is to be understood as  temporal  as  eternal  or  both  yet the same limitation with respect to the  Love of Christ  must necessarily be understood viz that  the Apostle wished he might perish  whether in this world or the next  not as an Enemy of Christ but as a Saviour of his Brethren  agreeable to the remark of the learned Chrysostom and as CHRIST himself also was  MADE A CURSE FOR US  Gal iii  See this point clearly stated by the Rev Dr John Sharp in his  Sym∣phonia Prophetarum et Apostolorum  Printed at Geneva in  yet it is manifest  that the affectionate and truly patriotic Apostle would have been ready to suffer every kind of  temporal misery  and even to  lay down his Life  for the  refractory Nation  if he could thereby have averted the approaching vengeance from his countrymen and restored them to Grace and the promised Privileges of the Gospel to which they had been the first invited of all other nations And therefore we cannot surely conceive that  the Prin∣ciple of Action  or  Motive  to such a declaration was  Selflove  The disinterested Principles of this Apostle are evident also from some other expressions and especially from that in his Epistle to the Romans v viz  peradventure  for a good Man  says he  some would even  dare to die  which idea totally excludes the Principle of  Selflove  But though the Apostle's  Expressions  sufficiently prove that  Selflove was not  his Principle of Action yet the same was more effectually demonstrated by his  Life  and  Practice  And again When we read of JONA∣THAN'S inviolable  Friendship  towards DAVID can we conceive that he was actuated by  Selflove  We cannot men∣tion that  Principle  without injustice to the generous character of that truly noble Prince unless we speak of it comparatively to shew that his  Friend∣ship  and  brotherly Love was equal to it  for the Scripture repeatedly informs us that he  loved  DAVID  "as his own Soul"  It was not  an unreasonable Friendship  he was well convinced of the  Merit  and  Virtue  of DAVID for on these he found∣ed his  Love  and he had too much  Vir∣tue  himself to violate a  reasonable Friend∣ship  even though his own  private Inte∣rest  and  very Inheritance  was at stake  These points were most earnestly pressed upon him with all the authority that an anxious worldlyminded father could possibly assume and yet without effect  As long as the Son of Jesse liveth upon the ground  said Saul to Jona∣than  thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die  Now if  Selflove  had been  the Principle of Action  with JONATHAN he could not have greater temptation But he knew how  to refuse  THE EVIL  and  CHUSE THE GOOD  and would not therefore submit like modern statesmen to the wretched policy of  doing  "Evil that Good might come"    Honour  and  Justice  were his  Principles of Action  and he was willing to risque not only his worldly dignity and state but his life also rather than injure and forsake an innocent man  Where∣fore shall he be slain  said he  What harm hath he done  And when he found that his father persisted in his base resolution he was filled with honest in∣dignation and as the text informs  rose from the table  IN FIERCE ANGER  not on account of his father's inju∣rious behaviour to  himself  in attempt∣ing to kill him with a javelin but be∣cause  he was grieved  FOR DAVID  says the text and that  his father had done him shame  See Sam xx to  And againWas  David  King of Is∣rael actuated by  Selflove  when he ten∣dered  his own Life  to save  the Lives of his Subjects  praying God to  Let his  hand be against him and against his father's house  instead of the nation in general  Surely his Principles of Action were very different from  Selflove  or from that imaginary PATERNAL PRECEPT of  "seeking his own Happiness"  His  Conscience  probably informed him that he was guilty before God in having  numbered  the Israelites to satisfy some vain or presumptuous curiosity concern∣ing  the Strength of the Nation  at a time when his whole confidence and hope of success against his enemies ought to have been placed in GOD  alone  and he would perhaps then recollect that the same  sinful Presumption within himself  which had  occasioned  the undertaking had also  occasioned  This example proves that KINGS and PRINCES are indispensably bound to exercise themselves daily and constantly in the study of the Holy Scriptures agreeable  to the command in Deut xvii  And it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this Law in a book out of  that which is  before the Priests the Levites and it shall be with him and he shall  read therein all the days of his life  that he may learn to fear the LORD his God to keep all the words of this Law and these Statutes to do them that  his heart be not lifted up above his brethren  and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or  to  the left to the end that he may  prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in  the midst of Israel  lest they should inadvertently  occasion  any breach of GOD'S LAWS and thereby draw down the Divine Vengeance upon them∣selves as well as their unwary subjects who are  equally guilty  whenever they comply with an  unlawful  command  the neglect of that tribute  or offering to God which in the Law is expressly enjoined to be given as a ransom  for the Soul  of every individual of that nation whenever they  should be num∣bered  viz half a shekel for every one  When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number  said GOD to Moses  then shall they give  EVERY MAN A RANSOM FOR HIS SOUL UNTO THE LORD  when thou numberest them that  THERE BE NO PLAGUE  among them when thou num∣berest them  c See Exod xxx to  REASON and CONSCIENCE therefore taught him that he  himself  was the principal aggressor and these  just Prin∣ciples  joined to a  patriotic Regard  for  the Preservation of his Countrymen  cer∣tainly induced him to present himself to God as the proper victim of divine VengeanceFor  DAVID  spake unto the  LORD  when he saw the angel that smote the people and saidLo I have sinned and I have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done Let thine hand I pray thee  BE AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY FATHER'S HOUSE  c  Sam xxiv  It would surely be highly absurd to attribute so pathetic and penitent a de∣claration to the Principle of  Selflove  Some excellent arguments and very striking ex∣amples have been produced by the truly benevolent  Mr Brooke  of Dublin in his  "Fool of Quality"  to prove  that  Selflove  is by no means  the universal Principle of Action  To quote the authority of a romance in a Tract on the  first Principles of Law  will perhaps at first sight give offence to many of my readers but for my excuse I rely on the propriety of the arguments themselves and the just application of the several  real examples  by which they are illustrated I should never of my own accord I confess have consulted any work under  the Form of a Novel  for information of this kind but the sentiments of this sensible author being pointed out to me by a worthy friend I thought it would be injustice to my ar∣gument if I neglected to refer my readers to the clear light which the worthy Author of  the Fool of Quality  has thrown upon the subject when he makes his EARL OF MORELAND enquire  whence how by what means may a Man arrive at HappinessBy getting out of himself my Lord  answered his worthy character MR MEEK∣LY  Out of himself Mr Meekly you astonish me greatly A contradiction in terms unnatural impossible  GOD  himself my Lord cannot make a Man happy in any other way either here or hereafter It is said the Earl an established maxim among all thinking Men whe∣ther Divines or Philosophers that  SELFLOVE  is the Motive to all Human ActionsVirtue forbid exclaimed Mr Meekly all Actions are justly held good or evil base or honourable detestable or amiable merely according to their Motives But if the Motive is the same in all there is an end at once to the possibility of virtue the cruel  and the kind the faithful and the perfidious the prostitute and the patriot are confounded together  c  He afterwards relates in very striking terms the wellknown example of  Damon  and  Pythias  whose inviolable FRIENDSHIP triumphed over SELFLOVE as well as over the cruel intentions of the Tyrant  Dionysius  Then follows the Author's excellent definition of the term SELF wherein he demonstrates the necessity of overcoming SELFISHNESS by  superior Principles  originally commu∣nicated to our Nature by the  Divine Intelligence  and he proves that  such Principles  have prevailed in the world by reminding us of the ancient states of SPARTA and ROME which  derived their lustre and power their whole preeminence and praise  says he  from this Principle of Communication which in them was called  LOVE OF COUNTRY  But this beatifying Prin∣ciple  continues he  was still more eminently instanced in the Society of  THE CHURCH OF JERUSALEM  who had all things in common who imparted their possessions to all men as every man had need and thence did eat their common bread with gladness and singleness of heart praising  GOD  and having favour with all people  c  He afterwards mentions the instances of the Roman  Regulus  and the  Decii  as also that of  Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans  who devoted their lives for THE LIBERTIES  of Greece  c and lastly exem∣plifies  this  DISREGARD OF SELF  the vital Source and Principle of every Virtue in six Mechanics or Crafts∣men  of the city of Calais  when it was besieged by King Edward the d  The whole argument with the examples are too long to be inserted here but are highly worthy the reader's perusalSee THE FOOL OF QUALITY vol p    The Monarch of Israel was actuated by a much less reasonable  Principle of  Action  and still very opposite to  Selflove  when he uttered that bitter  lamentation for the death of his wicked rebellious and incestuous Son  Absalom    Would to  GOD  said he  I had died for thee my Son  NATURAL PATERNAL AFFECTION was more powerful in this case than REASON and every other  Principle of Action  even  Selflove  which is also a  natural Affection  and generally very po∣tent was entirely superseded by it for the King most earnestly wished that he himself had died instead of that unna∣tural wretch who he was well aware ceased not whilst he lived to plot his father's ruin being an enemy he well knew that was implacable that was restless and impatient to deprive him  not only of his kingdom but of his life and had already violated his bed in the most publick and shameless manner with the detestable crime of incest There was no room to hope for the reformation of a wretch that had so entirely lost  all distinction between  GOOD  and  EVILNo gleam of happiness for his injured father but in his death And yet  paternal Affection  compelled the latter to esteem even  his own death  pre∣ferable if he could thereby have pro∣longed the wretch's life  O my Son Absalom my Son my Son Absalom Would to God  said he  I had  DIED FOR THEE  O Absalom my Son my Son  Sam xviii  Thus it appears that SELFLOVE is by no means  the universal Principle of Action  since there are other  Affec∣tions  which sometimes supersede it and become the leading  Principles of Action  A certain noble Author of the last century in a work intituled  A View of the Soul  has several chapters con∣cerning the Power and Influence of the  Affections  over all the other natural fa∣culties  Reason itself  not being excepted and in one chapter he attempts to prove  that some Affection is the substantial Part of the Soul  I have thought  says this Author  and do think and believe which is somewhat more than a thought it is a thought with the concurrence appro∣bation and allowance of one's Reason that the Soul of Man is immortal and that the very Essence or substantial part of a Human Soul disrobed of a Body or subsisting of itself is some restless working however at some times invisible affection and that if those more noble faculties of our Soul next and imme∣diately under that bright heavenly Star are the Pilots to conduct us unto rest some affection as it seems to me is the chief Passenger in this frail and weak Vessel of the flesh St Paul in that admirable Encomium of his of Charity tells us that  it abides  when many other gifts fail And if  we shall know as we are known  as he tells us in another place there will be then little use of the Invention Memory Reason or the like which are but the Handmaids to knowledge Neither can I rationally imagine after return of the  Soul to its place of rest or for default thereof in its banishment to everlasting wandering any use of other faculties than the affections unless towards the ex∣alting or heightening them in their several degrees whether love and joy on the one side or sorrow fear c on the other  The Soul of Man being an emanation from that DIVINE LOVE must necessarily partake of it LOVE and not able at present by any natural light it has to reach unto itself its proper object lays hold on any thing rather than seem to vanish or be extinct and withal that it happens to have such several inclinations in man while it is here is surely by reason of some false imaginary light or the want of a true one and that we want both power and skill in the setting or tuning some strings of the affections as I may call them And it is want of a clear inspect into our na∣ture and frame that we become as David speaks  a stubborn generation a generation that set not their hearts aright and whose Spirit cleaveth not stedfastly to God  And I do further believe that all the faculties strength and power of the Soul which we have are given us towards the performance of that  first  and great  Commandment Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy Soul and with a  thy mind  The whole Soul beside seems naturally subservient if not subsequent to the affections motion and the motion of the Soul would be strange without them and not imaginable they being as necessary as  they are useful And therefore I think we may as well cease to be by our own power as cease to affect and they who have gone furthest or most covertly herein have in going about to hide some particular affections shewed others more visibly and for the covering of their joy or sorrow fear or anger or the like have set up for predominant in their Soul a seeming contempt of all things which is an affection itself and for ought I know as subject to be faulty as any For surely the Soul may seem no less glorious in its march with all its parts and retinue than some of them provided it marches the right way and each faculty help and assist and not go about to destroy each other  A VIEW OF THE SOUL Sect pages  But though  the  Affections  are certainly to be esteemed  "Principles of Action"  yet they cannot  at any rate be admitted as  Rules of Obedience  as I have before observed concerning the  Affection of Selflove  be∣cause the generality of Mankind are more liable to be influenced by  evil misplaced Affections  than by those which might tend to their  real Happiness  The  Affections  of the avaricious Man for instance are all subordinate to his  Affection  for amassing temporal wealth he may  love  his wife and children perhaps when the  natural Affections  of  the husband and parent do not interfere with his predominant passion for riches but whenever they do the wretch loses all feeling for his own flesh and blood and will eagerly  sacrifice to  MAMMON the peace of his family and the hap∣piness of his beloved children even in the most material circumstance of their lives And though such a wretch is sometimes influenced indeed by the more general Principle of  Selflove  that is whenever the consideration of  Self  happens to fall in competition with his duty to other men yet even  Selflove itself  must yield to the  Love of Hoarding  since it is the wellknown characteristic of the Miser to withhold all the com∣forts of life  even from  HIMSELF in order that he may indulge his unreason∣able  Affection  for amassing wealth which  Depravity  if not assiduously and care∣fully checked in time will most surely increase with age till it becomes inve∣terate  and irresistable and entirely  en∣slave  its wretched Votary  It would be well for such men if they deprived themselves only of  tem∣poral  comforts but alas AVARICE defeats SELFLOVE even in its most im∣portant concern  Eternal Welfare  Go to now ye Rich Men weep and howl of your miseries that shall come upon you  James v Compare this with what has already been mentioned in pages  The  depraved Appetites  and  Affections  of Drunkards and Gluttons are also PRINCI∣PLES OF ACTION which are frequently too powerful both for  Reason  and  Consci∣ence  and even for  Selflove  for they too often lead Men with their eyes open to  certain destruction  even though they are warned by the clearest Conviction and  Foreknowledge  concerning the inevitable consequences of their respective vices Diseases misery and death may stare  them in the face and mark them by their gradual approaches as the unfor∣tunate victims of these criminal indul∣genciesbut how seldom do they deter Nay the certain expectation even of eternal damnation is not sufficient to re∣form them and the learned Dr Hales has produced an example    so bewitching is this infatuation that though they cannot most of them but be sensible  says Dr Hales  that they are manifestly shortening their days and just plunging themselves into their graves yet will they not refrain This an eminent Physician was so sensible of from his own unhappy experience that he said when Men had got a habit of it THEY WOULD GO ON THOUGH THEY SAW HELLFIRE BURNING BEFORE THEM  A Friendly Admonition to Drinkers of Gin Brandy  c By  Stephen Hales  DD p  concern∣ing Drunkards to prove that they would  go on  even though they should see  HellFire  before their eyes  The depraved  Affections  for every other vice as  Lust Gaming  c are equally capable of supplanting the universal  Principles of  Selflove  and  Common Sense  and do frequently carry Men headlong to destruction when it is impossible but that they must have foreseen the necessary consequences of their inordinate pur∣suits  How carefully therefore ought Man∣kind to guard themselves against every  unlawful Affection  and strenuously to resist them whenever they occur lest any undue  Affection  should become the  reigning Principle of Action  and lead the poor  enslaved  mortal to eternal destruction  From whence  come  wars and fightings among you  Come they  not hence  EVEN OF YOUR LUSTS THAT WAR IN YOUR MEMBERS  Ye  LUST  and have not ye  KILL  and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye  ASK NOT  Ye  ASK  and receive not because ye  ASK AMISS  that ye may consume it upon  your  LUSTS  Ye  ADULTERERS  and  ADULTERESSES  know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God  James iv  But many actions which may seem ap∣parently to have been occasioned merely by  corrupt Affections  are nevertheless promoted by a more latent cause I mean the  Inspiration  or  Influence of the spiritual Enemies  THE DEVIL is not merely a name which those who would sap the foundations of religion pre∣tend religion has contrived to frighten timorous minds nor is danger then only to be apprehended from him when he is supposed to assume a bodily form it is superstitious weakness to be afraid of him only when imbodied and to neglect the secret and unseen influ∣ence which his continual converse with us as an unimbodied spirit may have upon us He and his angels are not yet  cast into outer darkness  tho' it be prepared for them the mouth of the bottomless pit is not yet closed over them they fell from GOD not so much by a local descent as by mental apostasy and dissimilitude and they have still this visible world once the seat of their happiness and glory to range in they are therefore stiled by the Apostle  spiritual  wickednesses in high places  and their leader is called  The God of this World The Prince of Darkness The Prince of the power of the Air  Uncloathed and un∣imbodied spirits may converse with us by secret il∣lapses without our perception of the medium through which they act even  the wind bloweth where it listeth and we hear the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth  As there are Divine Illuminations communicated to the soul by THE GOOD SPIRIT OF TRUTH so there are impure suggestions to the fancy made by The Evil Spirit of Darkness and a watchful observer of his own heart must have heard the frequent whispers both of The Voice of Wisdom and The Voice of Folly he from whose eyes a Heavenborn Faith in CHRIST has re∣moved the scales of corruption may easily discern The Calm Irradiations of Divine Light leading him to holiness and peace and the foul and disturbed fires of Satan betraying him into sin and misery  But tho' our Enemy be invisible and on that ac∣count more able to execute his malignant designs against us yet let us not so dread his power as to decline the contest While our minds are constantly turned to  That Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world  while we desire it and depend upon it as The Light of Life we shall always be able to know and to guard against the stratagems of the Apostate Spirit whether he appears in his own naked deformity or cloaths himself like  an Angel of  Light  A forced imitation will always fall short of the archetype and tho' sin and falsehood may put on the mantle of Holiness and Truth yet he that is in∣wardly acquainted with  The Truth as it is in  JESUS and ingenuously loves and pursues it will be able to detect the imposture and through the veil behold the blackness and malignity of the enemies to his peace  "Evangelical Discourses"  by the worthy and ingenious Mr John Payne Discourse V p  and  Deceivers of Mankind  which must also be reckoned amongst the various  Principles  or  Motives to  Action  because nothing can be more certain than that these  incorporeal  MA∣LIGNANT BEINGS take a most dan∣gerous advantage though unperceived of all immoral carnal  Affections  in un∣guarded worldly Men and do thereby lead the unwary and careless Liver into the most detestable  Slavery  The  Original or Fundamental Temptation  by which Satan draws men into the snare of  Servitude  or bondage spiritual is by enlarging or improving their desires not of things simply evil but of things either natural or indifferent that is for their kind or qua∣lity not unlawful These desires being improved unto the full or unto some excessive measure do by long custom or continuance require satisfaction by as strong a law of necessity at least as importunately as our na∣tural desires of food or raiment do The more ex∣cessive or exorbitant any desire is the more impatient  it is of repulse It is as impossible for a greedy or  ravenous Appetite  to be satisfied with a spare or mo∣derate diet as for a moderate appetite to be satisfied without any food at all A vain  Fantastick  that takes proud cloaths to be  Part of Himself  is as desirous of change of suits or costly apparel as a poor man is of apparel itself or of such stuff as is sufficient to keep out cold and wet An  ambitious Spirit  is not so well content with an ordinary place or rank amongst  Free∣men  as an ingenuous mind will be with the estate or condition of an hired  Servant  if no better by means fair and honest be likely to befal him  A Man apt to overprize himself  and jealous withal of contempt of wrong or of gross abuse is not so easily appeased with streams of blood as a calm and gentle spirit is with an ingenuous acknowledgment of wrongs done or with a courteous answer for wrongs suspected The desire of wealth or worldly goods after it hath once exceeded its lawful bounds becomes as unsatisfiable as Hell It enlargeth itself by often satisfaction and of all earthly and mortal things it knows no stint or period of growth but grows strong and lusty by waxing old  None of these desires  of meat of drink of apparel of satisfaction for wrongs done or suspected of ho∣nour riches or preferment are  in themselves  or for their quality  unlawful  Their  unlawfulness  consists only in their  excess  But even the best of these or like  desires being improved beyond its measure will for its private satisfaction  betray the Soul  which gives it harbour into Satan's hands He doth not he need not tempt any man to be a thief a robber or a murtherer  For  as St James tells us Chap  Every man is tempted  to these and the like crimes  by his own concupiscence  and our  concupiscences and sensual desires are always increased by custom  He that hath long inured himself to exceed either in quality of meat or drink or to fare deliciously desires only to satisfy his appetite or to observe his delightful  custom  so these may be satisfied he hath no desire to be a  thief  to be a  cheater  or couzener But  rather than his intemperate appetite should be unsatisfied  he will take himself to some other part of  Satan's Service  and adventure on  theft  or  murther  or any other breach of God's commandments  Dr Jackson's Works Vol p  that  they may dishonour the work of God and prepare the deluded Mortal for eter∣nal shame and punishment  The amazing power and force of the  unlawful Affections  which I have already described cannot reasonably be account∣ed for on any other Principles We have no right however to murmur at God's permission of  spiritual Temptations  whereby the Divine  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  presumptuously assumed by Man is  proved  and  tried  especially as the Almighty has mercifully been pleased  to give us the most ample warning throughout the Scriptures of our con∣tinual danger insomuch that the Chri∣stian Church hath generally made the necessary resistance  to Evil Spirits  an ex∣press Article of the Baptismal Vow viz To  renounce the Devil and all his Works  Nevertheless the unreason∣able  Heresy  of the  Sadduces  who were the  Deists  of ancient times not only subsists to this day but seems even to prevail in a most dangerous degree for there are many people amongst us who  profess  to  believe  the Scriptures and yet affect to  disbelieve  the existence of those malignant spiritual Beings commonly mentioned and signified under the name of  "the Devil"  though the Scriptures afford the clearest testimony concerning them but our modern  Sadduces  endea∣vour to explain all texts wherein Devils or Evil Spirits are mentioned as mere customary figures of speech expressive of  some  Evil  Affections and sometimes of mere bodily Disorders  According to them  said Archbp Sharp  the Devil that is so often spoken of in the Scriptures is nothing else but either a disease of the body or a phantasm in the brain or the wicked principles and inclinations of a man's heart This is the doctrine of Mr Hobbs and his followers  But there cannot a vainer conceit enter into a man's head than this is By the very same logic that they can prove this they may likewise prove that all those men that are spoken of in the Old and New Testa∣ment were not real persons but qualities For it is certain that the Devil is in the Scripture as much represented as a person a real subsisting being distinct from God and from good angels and from mankind I say he is as plainly thus represented as any man or woman that is there mentioned is And he for in∣stance that will say that when our Saviour was tempted by the Devil in the wilderness all this was but a tran∣saction of his imagination and that it was only his own fancy that presented to his eyes all the kingdoms of the world and that it was only his own fancy that set him upon a pinacle of the temple and would have had him fallen down and worshipped it I say he that would give such an account as this of that matter may with the same reason say that Jesus himself was but a phantasm an imagination and that there was never such a real person in the world  The Devil then has a real Being of his own inde∣pendent of us or any other creature and that Being is of the  spiritual or angelic nature  As there are good spirits and good angels so there are evil spirits and evil angels and of this latter sort is the the Devil  But then secondly When we are speaking of the Devil we are not to understand any one particular being or any one particular evil spirit but the whole aggregate or company of evil spirits which inhabit round about us in the lower regions of the air All these are in the scripture language and in common speech called by the name of the Devil and some∣times in the plural number by the name of Devils  For the understanding this we are to know that among that infinite and innumerable company of angels which God created in a happy and glorious condition all of them did not continue in that primitive happi∣ness but several of them by their wilful apostasy from God forfeited that dignity and glory they were pos∣sessed of and so depraved their natures that they were incapable of dwelling any longer where they did before but were by the just vengeance of God cast down into these lower regions of the air where they are reserved by Providence to the judgment and pu∣nishment of the great day  This is the plain account that the Scriptures give us as to this matter Thus St Jude in the th verse of  his Epistle  The angels  saith he  that kept not their first estate but left their own habitations them hath God re∣served in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judg∣ment of the great day  And just to the same purpose and almost in the same words doth St Peter speak in the second chapter of his second Epistle verse the fourth  These fallen angels now thus thrust down from heaven tho' they do yet in a great measure retain all the intellectual accomplishments of the angelical na∣ture such as reason and memory and knowledge yet are they in their moral qualities quite contrary to all the good angels and particularly as to this that as the good angels are infinitely kind and benign great lovers of God and of mankind and most intirely dis∣posed to do all good offices to them whatsoever so the nature of those fallen angels is cruel and revengeful full of hatred and spite and malice to God and to his whole creation and upon account of this the Scripture hath given to them the name of Satan or Devil which two words as all that understand the learned languages know signify neither more nor less than an adversary or an accuser or calumniator The one being the Hebrew word for it and the other the Greek word And indeed it is with reference to this enmity to mankind that most of these names and cha∣racters that they bear in Scripture are bestowed upon them Upon this account it is that the Devil is called a murderer a deceiver a lyar and the father of lyes  the destroyer the old serpent the great dragon with sundry other such appellations But then tho' these names being put in the singular number seem to denote some single evil spirit that bears illwill to mankind yet we are always to remember that they are to be expounded collectively that is to say to signify the whole body of these apostate spirits of which there are a vast number I say the whole body of them for that these lapsed angels are formed into a body politic or government or kingdom is plainly enough inti∣mated in the New Testament for there we meet with the kingdom of darkness in opposition to the kingdom of light and there we meet with the prince of the Devils as the chief of them who is likewise by St Paul called  The god of this world and the prince of the power of the air  Under whom also as in other societies there are many subordinate officers as St Paul seems to intimate in the th of the Ephesians where among the wicked spirits in heavenly places that is in the air as Grotius with the ancients rightly expounds it that he saith we wrestle against he makes mention in the plural number of principalities and powers and other rulers of the darkness of this world  This is the Scripture account of these matters I must confess it may seem a very odd thing to some that there should be in the world a society of such spi∣rits as are confessedly endowed with all the knowledge and subtilty of the angelical nature and yet are so hor∣ribly  degenerated in their morals as to take pleasure in every thing that is naught and even in ruining mankind if they could But that it is really possible that there should be such beings  doth in some measure appear from the prodigious instances of the depravation of reasonable natures that we sometimes see among ourselves  there being men of excellent parts and endowments to be found that do sometimes so far degenerate from human kind that for all manner of wickedness and malice they may be rather called  Devils than men  But that it is more than possible that there are a race of such spirits as do malign the welfare of mankind and take pleasure in making fools and wretches and  slaves of them  is too evident both from all the histo∣ries of past ages and from the sad experience of some nations at this day who if we may credit the histories that are writ of them do miserably  groan under the violences and tyranny of the Devil  But however no one that acknowledgeth the truth of the Scripture can possibly doubt of this for what I have now deli∣vered is so plainly affirmed in the Old and New Testa∣ment that there is no evading of it And indeed this hypothesis of the being of evil spirits and their ill will to mankind and their concerning themselves continually to do us mischief  is so interwoven with and makes so considerable a part of the scheme of our reli∣gion as it is delivered by Christ and his Apostles that we cannot deny the one without much weakening if  not altogether overthrowing the other  Archbishop Sharp's Sermons Vol p  Howsoever plausible this kind of sophistry may ap∣pear  where applied to some few parti∣cular passages yet there are others so  clear in the literal expression and so well guarded by the scope or intention  of the subject delivered in the context that it is impossible to wrest them from  the obvious literal meaning without perverting all the rules of grammar and common sense  We are most carefully warned by the great Apostle to the Gentiles to be upon our guard against these powers of darkness  Put on the whole Armour of God  says he  that ye may be able to stand  AGAINST THE WILES OF THE DE∣VIL  For we wrestle not with  FLESH  and  BLOOD  but against  PRINCIPA∣LITIES  against  POWERS  against  THE RULERS OF THE DARKNESS OF THIS WORLD  against spiritual Wick∣edness in high places  Eph vi  In the same Epistle iv the Apostle still further warns the Ephesians against the SPIRITUAL ENEMY  Nei∣ther  says he  give place to the  DEVIL  And in his d Epistle to  the Corinthians ii he signifies his forgiveness to some offending person probably meaning that fornicator whom he ordered in the st Epistle Chap to be excommunicated He says  for  your sakes  forgave I it  in the person or in the sight or presence of Christ  lest  SATAN  should get an advantage over us for we are not ignorant of his De∣vices  The Apostle James also warns us upon the same points  Resist the Devil  says he  and he will flee from you  iv And the Apostle Peter is still more particular in his ad∣vice on this head  Be sober be vigi∣lant  says he  because your Ad∣versary  THE DEVIL  as a roaring Lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour Whom  RESIST  steadfast in the faith  c  Pet v  The same Apostle also tells us that  GOD  spared not  THE ANGELS  that  sinned but cast them  DOWN TO HELL  and delivered them into  CHAINS OF DARKNESS  to be reserved unto Judg∣ment  Pet ii  The Word which is here translated "  down to  HELL" viz    down to  Tar∣tarus  or  in Tartarus    is derived from the Greek verb    Terreo  to  dread  or  be in Terror  so that even if  Tartarus  or  Hell  does not signify a real  Place  But the place of torment or  Hell  after the day of Judgment must necessarily signify a  real Place  of ma∣terial  Fire  because  all Men  are to rise again  with their Bodies  And  though  after my skin  worms  destroy this  Body yet  IN MY FLESH  shall I see God  Job xix  and consequently will be capable of  bodily  punishment for it is not the  Soul alone  but the  whole Body  of the unrepenting Sinner that will be  cast into Hell  If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy mem∣bers should perish and not that  thy  WHOLE BODY  should be cast into Hell  Matt v    and as  Human Bodies  after the Resurrection will be  incorruptible  For the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised  incorruptible  and we shall be changed For this cor∣ruptible must put on incorruption and this  mortal  must  put  on IMMORTALITY  Cor xv  or  everlasting  so of course  they will be capable of  everlasting bodily  punishment in  the fire that never shall be quenched where  THEIR WORM DIETH NOT  and the Fire is not quenched  Mark ix and this FIRE which must be a  ma∣terial  Fire as  Bodies  are to be punished in it is  the very same  FIRE that is  prepared for the Devil and his An∣gels  Depart from me ye cursed into  everlasting Fire  pre∣pared for  the Devil  and  his Angels  Matt xxv  and consequently we may be assured that the latter though  Spirits  will also be rendered as capable as the Human Bodies of feeling the perpetual torment of that Fire And lastly it is not improbable that even  this Terrestial Globe  on which the worldlyminded seem to place their whole desire and happiness may hereafter be∣come that very  Hell  or place of future punishment both for wicked  Men  and  Devils  since it has so long been the seat both of  Human  and  Diabolical  wickedness for Moses seems to intimate in his prophetical song that there is a  worldly Hell    a Fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn  UNTO THE LOWEST HELL      and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains  Deut xxxii Commentators generally remark indeed that HELL is mentioned here only as a  Type  or  Metaphor  of the most extreme  temporal  misery or sufferings in  this life  agreeable to the tenor of the subject carried on in the fol∣lowing verses yet the having recourse to such a  Meta∣phor  certainty implies a real idea of  Hell  and of the future destruction of the world BY FIRE for otherwise  the recital of these circumstances even as  Metaphors  or  Types  would be useless and unintelligible It may be objected indeed that the present world will be  consumed  or agreeable to the literal expression of the Hebrew in this text EAT  by the Fire  which is also foretold by the Apostle Peterthat  the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up  Pet iii  So that the  Earthly  FIRE must at length CEASE for want of materials if all  earthly things  are to  "be burned up"  and to  "pass away"  Heaven  and  Earth  shall PASS AWAY but my words shall NOT PASS AWAY  Matt xxiv See also chap v and Luke xvi  in fire and smoke Whereas the  "Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels"  is ex∣pressly declared to be an  everlasting Fire  Matth xxv Yet these last considerations will afford no just ob∣jection to what I have before suggested because THE ALMIGHTY can surely render the Fire  perpetual  by a continual accession of new materials as the old are con∣sumed or by a variety of other means which like most other operations of Providence are infinitely above hu∣man comprehension agreeable to the intimation of the Prophet Isaiah tho' the same is also given as a  Metaphor  of extreme temporal sufferingsviz  and the  STREAMS  thereof shall be turned into  PITCH  and the  DUST  thereof into  BRIMSTONE  and the  LAND  thereof shall become  BURNING PITCH  It shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever  c Isaiah xxxiv  it signifies at least an actual  State  or  Condition  of extreme  Terror  and  horrible Darkness  in which even SPI∣RITS  may be involved or as it were  bound  for the Apostle by the idea of  Darkness  here expressed may perhaps  allude to a total  Exclusion  from the  Light Comfort  and  Influence  of the  Divine Grace  or an entire Withdrawing of the glorious CREATOR'S  Light  and  Spirit  by which  Exclusion  or  Withdrawing  the wilful  Reprobacy  of these rebellious  An∣gels  might probably have been fixed upon them as an indelible stain of in∣famy to  mark them for future punishment  and to exclude them from all hope of escaping the Divine Justice So that those Spiritual Beings which once were  glorious  in their Nature being created  "Angels of Light"  have rendered them∣selves most  inglorious  and  detestable  by misusing that Liberty in which the benevolent Creator had placed them for they  kept not their first Estate  And the Angels which  KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST ESTATE  but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting Chains under Darkness unto the Great Day  Jude  but  wickedly withdrew themselves from  "their own Habitation"  and have  thereby been the wilful Authors of their own disgraceful and depraved Na∣ture the Diabolical Disposition which is founded only in their own voluntary wickedness  for  GOD IS NOT  the Author  OF CONFUSION  God hath declared indeed by his Prophet Isaiah c xlv  I FORM  the Light and  CREATE DARKNESS  I make Peace and  CREATE EVIL  I the  LORD DO ALL THESE  Things  But  the latter part of this sentence  says the learned Dr Louth Pre∣bend of Winchester in  explains the former  LIGHT  being often put for Happiness and  DARKNESS  for Adversity The sense is  continues the Doctor  that all the vicissitudes of good or ill success are to be ascribed to Providence God sets up one kingdom that of  CYRUS  and pulls down another the  BABYLONIAN  monarchy  Commentary on Isaiah p To the same effect is the Paraphrase of the learned DEO∣DATI viz  I am the cause of all Goodness and Prosperity through my  BENIGNITY  as likewise by my  JUSTICE  I am Author of afflictions punishments  and  calamities  And indeed Commentators in general agree that the EVIL here to be understood is not the EVIL of  Sins  and  Vices    modo hic excludas  PECCATA  et  VITIA  quae sunt ex homine  says the learned Vitringa but the EVIL of  Afflictions Sicknesses subjection to foreign enemies  and all other  external  or  bodily Sufferings  whereby man∣kind are either  proved  and  tryed  that they may thereby set forth due examples of  Faith  and  Patience  to others  or else are  punished  and  chastised  according to the just dis∣pensation of GOD'S Providence in the government of the world Nevertheless GOD both  proves  and  punishes  man∣kind even by  internal Evil  for as the supreme direction and controul of all things whatsoever belong absolutely to GOD ALONE he is said in Scripture to DO what he only PERMITS upon  just  occasions  As when men wilfully forsake GOD's  Laws  and  Religion  preferring temporal gratifications to  Justice Righteousness  and  Truth  Such a gross abuse of the  natural Knowledge of Good and Evil  is presumptuous  Sin  and "  he that committeth  SIN  is of the  DEVIL John iii But if God permits men to be ensnared by the delusions of the DEVIL  after the working of  SATAN  with all power  and  signs  and  lying wonders  and  with all  DECEIVABLENESS  of unrighteousness in them that perish  a plain reason is assigned for such permission  be∣cause they received not the love of the  TRUTH  that they might be saved And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should  BELIEVE A LYE  that they all might be damned  or judged  who believed not the  TRUTH  but had pleasure in UNRIGHTEOUSNESS  Thess ii  by withdrawing his restraining Grace from man and  giving him up  en∣tirely to the bent of his own inclination  GOD  also  GAVE THEM UP  to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts  c And againGOD GAVE THEM UP  unto vile affections  And again  GOD GAVE THEM OVER  to a reprobate mind  c For all which plain reasons are given shewing that the  wilful wickedness  of man is the one foundation or first cause of God's deserting or thus GIVING THEM UP  so that they are without excuse  says the Apostle Paul  Because that when they knew God they glorified him not  as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imagi∣nations and their foolish heart was darkened Professing them∣selves to be wise they became fools  c WHEREFORE GOD  also  GAVE THEM UP  to uncleanness through the lusts of their  OWN HEARTS  c See Romans i and even God's own servants may sometimes be deserted or left to them∣selves for a time as King Hezekiah was upon a particular occa∣sion when the ambassadors came to him from Babylon  to en∣quire of the wonder that was done in the land  for then  GOD LEFT HIM  to try him that he might know all    that  was  in his heart  Chron xxiii That is according to the Dutch annotation  that God might make known to  HISKIA  and to all the Church what was in his heart For God made tryal of him for a while by the forementioned desertion that he might know himself and out of the sense and feeling of his own weakness and impotency might have cause to  HUMBLE HIMSELF  and that all believers beholding their own weakness and infirmity in him might work out their own salvation with fear and trembling  And accordingly we road that  HEZEKIAH HUMBLED HIMSELF  for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah  Chron xxxii  This example affords a clear illustration of the true sense in which God may be said to  "tempt"  or to  "lead into temptation"  viz GOD LEFT HIM  to try him  " c  or by ceasing  to restrain the power of spiritual deceivers  When the Divine vengeance and retribution was to be poured upon the wicked King  Ahab  he was GIVEN UP to the delusion of wicked spirits  And the Lord said Who shall per∣suade  AHAB  that he may  GO UP AND FALL  at Ramoth Gile∣ad  c And there came forth a spirit and stood before the  LORD  and said I will persuade him And the Lord said unto him wherewith And he said I will go forth and I will be a  LYING SPIRIT IN THE MOUTH OF ALL HIS PROPHETS  And he said Thou shalt persuade and prevail also go forth and do so  Wherefore the true Prophet Micaiah told Ahab  Behold the  LORD  hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy Prophets  c Kings xxii Here the effects of God's  permission  is plainly considered as  the act  of God for the spirit being rendered free to act agreeable to its own wicked prin∣ciples upon the persons mentioned  effected  the purpose of the  Divine Justice  and  Retribution  upon  Ahab  Thus the  very Devils  are used as instruments to fulfil the eternal  Justice  and  Judgment  of the Almighty upon the  unrighteous  and in such cases may properly be said to become the  "Principles of Action"  in Man  Hence arises the necessity of our daily prayer  Lead us not into  TEMPTATION  but deliver us from  EVIL  notwith∣standing  that we are assured by the Apostle James that GOD "TEMPTETH NONE"    but  EVERY MAN  is tempted when he is drawn away of his  OWN LUST and enticed  Then  says he  when  LUST  hath conceived it bringeth forth  SIN and SIN  when it is finished bringeth forth  DEATH  Jam i This latter text teaches us how we are to comprehend and limit such expressions as that above quoted from the Lord's Prayer  BUT OF  PEACE  Cor xiv  God cannot be tempted with Evil neither  tempteth he any Man  or rather  he tempteth  NONE    no Beings what∣soever  James i and  Out of the Mouth of the Most High proceedeth not  EVIL  and  GOOD  Lam iii so that as  Iniquity  can have no  Fellowship  GOD  is Light and in him is  NO DARKNESS  at all If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in  DARKNESS  we lye and do not the Truth but  if we walk in the  LIGHT  as he is in the  LIGHT  we have fellowship one with another and the blood of  JESUS CHRIST  his Son cleanseth us from all Sin  John i  with GOD these Apostate Spirits have of course been totally excluded from every Ray of the  Divine  LIGHT whereby in∣stead of continuing  Angels of Light  as at first  created  they are become totally  dark  and  opposite in every Principle  to the LIGHT  Goodness  and  Mercy  of THE AL∣MIGHTY so that they may now be called with propriety ANGELS of DARK∣NESS for tho' they sometimes deceit∣fully assume the opposite character  FOR SATAN HIMSELF is transformed into AN ANGEL OF LIGHT  Cor xi  in order to deceive the unwary yet their  Power  is only of  Darkness  The Apostle Paul apparently means these wicked Angels or Spirits when he warns us  against  POWERS  against the  RULERS  of the  DARKNESS  of this world  Ephes vi  And elsewhere they are spoken of col∣lectively as "THE POWER OF DARKNESS"  Giving thanks unto the  FATHER  says the same Apostle  which  hath made us to be partakers of the  inheritance of the Saints in  LIGHT who hath delivered us from THE POWER OF DARKNESS and hath translated  us  into the kingdom of his dear Son  Col i    "This is your hour"  said our Lord to the chief priests and elders of the Jews who came to apprehend him  and  THE POWER OF DARKNESS" Luke xxii  The Power of Death  hath also been attributed to the same ma∣lignant Spirits for Christ took upon himself our Nature  Flesh  and  Blood    that through  DEATH he might  destroy him that had  THE POWER OF DEATH  that is  THE DEVIL and  deliver them who through fear of  DEATH were all their lifetime  subject to  BONDAGE  Heb ii  being  bound  as it were in the  dark Chains  Pet ii  of their own  Iniquity  or  Reprobacy  in  the "everlasting Chains"  of horrible  Darkness  Jude  whereby they are effectu∣ally  "reserved for Judgment"  without being deprived of that activity in exer∣cising the malignity of their fixed re∣probate  Principles  and proneness to do  Evil  which the Scriptures in many other passages attribute to them For without some such supposition how shall we  reconcile the abovementioned text of the Apostle Peter as also that which is parallel to it in the Epistle of Jude wherein the fallen Angels are repre∣sented as bound  in  everlasting Chains under Darkness  unto the Judgment of the Great Day  And the Angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved  in everlasting Chains under  DARKNESS unto the Judg∣ment of the Great Day  Jude  with those other texts before quoted from the Apostles  Paul James  and  Peter  concerning the  Activity  and  Vigilance  of Diabolical Spi∣rits  The Apostle Paul as I before re∣marked warns us of  the Wiles of the  DEVIL  by which word in the singular number is commonly under∣stood the Prince  THE PRINCE of the Power of the Air THE SPIRIT that now worketh in the children of disobedi∣ence  Eph ii  Now shall  the Prince of this world  be cast out  John xii  Beelzebub the  PRINCE  of the Devils  Matt xii  or Chief of  the  fallen Angels  and tells that  we wrestle not against  FLESH AND BLOOD  but against  PRINCIPALITIES  against  POWERS  against the Rulers of the  DARKNESS  of this World  c  Eph vi being a clear declaration of the  Agency  and  Activity  of these invisible Spiritual Beings  Again the Apostle  James  tells us to  resist the  DEVIL  and he will  FLEE  from us  which excludes every idea of his being actually  bound  in chains of confinement And the Apostle  Peter  represents him as  a roaring Lion that  WALKETH ABOUT  seeking whom he may devour  which absolutely for∣bids the belief of  a local confinement  in any one place so that  the Chains  of  Darkness in Tartarus  may very well ex∣press  such a  total Darkness  of Apostacy and absolute Reprobation as I have sup∣posed wherein the disobedient Angels are  bound  and  reserved  for the day of Vengeance for  THE EVERLASTING FIRE  Having in a former note at p made some remarks concerning the probability that the present  Ter∣restrial Globe  on which the greater part of mankind seem to place their whole interest and desire will hereafter be∣come the region of EVERLASTING FIRE or  Hell  I have since had the satisfaction to find on a further examination of that point that the same opinion hath been long ago decisively asserted by my own grandfather in a sermon concerning  "the manner of the day of judgment"  and though I could wish my readers to peruse the whole ser∣mon yet I must beg leave to lay before them a short ex∣tract from it which is much to my present purpose  The second particular  says he  which the Scrip∣tures acquaint us with concerning the general judg∣ment is this that  the earth shall then be set on fire  and that in the most terrible manner imaginable Whether this general conflagration will happen upon Christ's coming to judgment or rather will be the last transaction of the judgment the Scripture doth not declare But that there shall be such a conflagration and that THIS FIRE SHALL BE FOR THE EVER∣LASTING PUNISHMENT BOTH OF THE DEVIL AND WICKED MEN WHO WILL ALL BE TUMBLED  DOWN INTO THESE LOWER REGIONS WHICH WILL THEN BE A PERFECT LAKE OR SEA OF FIRE as the Scripture expresseth it Rev xix is beyond all doubt To this purpose let us observe what the Apostle says  The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire to take vengeance of them that know not God and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ  Thess i  But more expresly this conflagration of the world is taught us in the second Epistle of St Peter Chap iii where the Apostle tells us that  as the world which was of old perished  by an universal deluge of  water so the heavens and the earth which are now are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men  From whence it is plain that at the day of judgment this world shall be set on fire and that fire shall be for the punishment of un∣godly men Furthermore in the verses following he adds to the same purpose  The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up  ver  If any one be at a loss to conceive how the heavens should be set on fire as well as the earth as St Peter three times in this chapter affirms they shall be the difficulty will be removed by considering that the hea∣vens here spoken of are not those heavens in which  stars are in which signification we commonly use that word but the sublunary heavens viz those lower re∣gions of the air wherein are the clouds and vapours and other meteors which are here called the elements and in which sense the heavens are frequently taken in holy Scripture Now these heavens together with all that is in them shall at that day pass away with a crackling noise of fire and the earth and all the things in it shall be put in flames David tells us that  upon the wicked God shall rain fire and brimstone and an hor∣rible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup  Psalm xi And our Saviour intimates the same when he tells us as  in the day when Lot went out of Sodom it it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed  Luke xvii  And now who can express the horror and confusion that shall be at that day Who can fancy so sad and dismal a face of things as shall then be all the world over Could we imagine ourselves to be present when the whole frame of nature is upon the point of dissolu∣tion and the whole world in flames about our ears with what terror and amazement should we be filled How would our hearts fail us  and our joints be loosed and our knees smite against each other  Dan v unless we were sure we were in the number of those who should be wafted up to meet the bridegroom with com∣fort Oh what will then become of all impenitent  sinners What will become of all worldly sensual am∣bitious voluptuous men who set up their rest in this world and mind nothing but their ease and the gra∣tification of their appetites or the pursuit of their secular interests When they shall see all that they loved all that they admired all that they delighted in gone irrecoverably gone in a moment Lastly what will become of all those bold profane persons who entertained all discourses of a future judgment only with scoffs and derision Oh how will they find themselves abused and see to their great amazement what they would never before believe that  there is a reward for the righteous that there is indeed a God that judgeth the earth  Ps lviii Archbishop Sharp's Sermons Vol p d Edit  prepared for the  DEVIL  and  HIS ANGELS  Matt xxv  being marked and distinguished from  other Spirits  by their confirmed propen∣sity  to  Evil  and their continual oppo∣sition to  every good Principle  which  renders their final condemnation to that  "everlasting Fire"  inevitable for  "the  DEVILS  also believe and tremble"  James ii by which it seems they  fore∣know  their own certain condemnation like those abandoned  Human Sinners  who  sin  WILFULLY  after  they  have received  THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH  to whom  there remain∣eth no more Sacrifice for Sins but a cer∣tain fearful  LOOKING FOR  of Judg∣ment and fiery Indignation which shall devour the Adversaries  Heb x  This clear description of  Human Re∣probacy  opens to us a very probable idea of the  Angelic Reprobacy  or the mode whereby the  Nature of Devils  was first occasioned and at the same time proves that  Men  are equally liable to fall into the same lamentable Degeneracy and horrible Apostacy from God and there∣by may become a sort of  Devils  Thus the reprobate Judas was mentioned even by our Lord himself who knew the wilful wickedness of his avaricious heart John vi  For JESUS  knew  from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him  John vi  and that he was  a thief  John xii was mentioned I say in express terms as being A DEVIL"  Have not I chosen you twelve  said our Lord to his disciples "  and one of you is  A DEVIL" John vi The MAN indeed was the  work  of the benevolent Creator but he became A DEVIL by the ope∣ration of his  own mind  assisted by the  spiritual Influence  of SATAN whom he neglected to  resist  thus wilfully abusing the divine hereditary  Knowledge of Good and Evil  within himself and of course partook of the  Diabolical Nature  which will most certainly be the unhappy case of  every other Man  who in like manner neglects that necessary  Resistance  to SATAN and his own predominant passions whereby he is rendered a  Slave  to habitual  Sin  but indeed of a very base and inferior  order for though they may be EQUAL perhaps IN WICKEDNESS when the restraining Power of  Conscience  or the  Divine Knowledge of Good and Evil  is entirely effaced or withdrawn from them yet they must remain as much INFERIOR IN POWER and ABILITIES as  Human Nature  is  inferior  to the cre∣ated Part of  Devils  I mean the  Angelic Nature  for the Scriptures inform us that ANGELS  are  GREATER  in Power and Might  Pet ii  and con∣sequently must retain a GREATER pro∣portion of both i e  Power  and  Might  even in their  fallen State  than  reprobate Men  The  Devils  or  Satanical Spirits  are constantly represented in the Scriptures to be as diametrically opposite in their Nature to the infinite Goodness of GOD as  Darkness  is to Light  GOD  is  LIGHT  and in him is no  DARKNESS  at all  John i  as  False∣hood  Ye are of your Father the  DEVIL c  When he speaketh a  LYE  he speaketh of  HIS OWN  for he is  a LYAR  and the Father of it  John viii  is  to Truth  I am the Way and the  TRUTH  and the Life  John xiv  as implacable and unprovoked  Malice  He  the Devil  was a MURDERER  from the beginning  and abode not in  the Truth  because there is  no Truth  in him  John viii  is to ever∣lasting  Mercy  and  Love  GOD is  Love  John iv  For the  LORD Jehovah  is good his  MERCY IS EVERLAST∣ING  and his  TRUTH  endureth to all generations  Psa c  And there∣fore as they were really  "Angels"  in  "their first Estate"  so entire a change in their very nature may fairly be ac∣counted as "  Chains of Darkness"of horrible Darkness  wherewith they are  bound  as it were and reserved for eter∣nal Judgment without hindrance or impediment to their natural activity in promoting  Evil  as far as God is pleased to permit in order to prove the Faith  of Mankind as in the severe trials of Job's patience and also in the tempta∣tion even of our Lord himself which cannot be otherwise understood than in a literal sense for CHRIST in  his Hu∣man Nature  not only overcame those  extraordinary  exertions of the Devil's power related by the Apostle Matthew Chap and the Evangelists Mark Chap and Luke Chap but was also  in all points tempted like as we are  yet  without Sin  Heb iv  And our Lord also declared the earnest wish and activity of the Spiritual Enemy to overcome the Faith of the Apostle Peter  Simon Simon  said our Lord  Behold  SATAN HATH DESIRED  to have  YOU  that  HE MAY SIFT you AS WHEAT  but I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy bre∣thren  Luke xxii  This is  a clear Revelation that  Human Nature  is really liable to the impulse and temp∣tations of  wicked Spirits  The above remarks are principally intended for the use of those persons who disbelieve the  Reality of Spi∣ritual Influence  but there are some people and worthy people too who are apt to fall into  a contrary Extreme  concerning  Spiritual  Adversaries I mean those persons who through bodily disorders are subject to  low Spirits and religious Melancholy  whereby they are led to conceive  either that  GOD  has forsaken them and left them to them∣selves or that it is the  DEVIL  that is always busy about them and raiseth those tumults and disturbances in their minds  And as this unhappy case of RELIGIOUS MELANCHOLY may be esteemed an  Affection of the Mind  as well as  of the Body  it certainly relates to my present subject and seems worthy of as much notice in this tract as most other  Affections of the Human Mind  which I have mentioned but I am precluded from offering any re∣marks of my own upon it by the writings of my grand∣father who has already treated this case so fully so judi∣ciously and so satisfactorily for the comfort of such per∣sons as may happen to want advice thereupon that it would be superfluous to add any thing more than a refe∣rence to those parts of his works where the subject is ex∣amined and discussed See Archbishop Sharp's Sermons Vol Serm p and indeed all the Sermons col∣lected in that Volume are on such points as are most liable to perplex and disturb the minds of persons subject  to  low Spirits  and  religious Melancholy  and the several difficulties are explained in such easy and natural argu∣ments as cannot fail to instruct and remove the doubts of every attentive reader  which will certainly prevail over us and  become  the Principles of Action  if we are not careful and vigilant to  resist  them as we ought for Christ did not forbid the Tempter from using his endeavours against  Peter  but only prayed that THE FAITH  of the Apostle  should not  fail  whereby he has taught us that a sound and stedfast FAITH for which WE ALSO  are bound to pray  will sufficiently enable us to resist the POWERS OF DARKNESS  But when Men disbelieve the very existence of those active  Spiritual Ad∣versaries  how should they be upon their guard to resist their influence For  Un∣belief  in the existence of  Spiritual Beings  will certainly be promoted even by the DEVILS  themselves  in all places where∣ever they can gain advantage by it and especially wherever Scepticism Deism  and the groundless notions of  the Sad∣ducees  are openly set up in opposition to the clear testimonies of revealed Re∣ligion and the true Faith for in all such places it is obvious that the in∣terest of  Satan  's empire will be promoted by a disbelief of his existence and con∣sequently that the  Angels of Darkness  will in such places most carefully abstain from every outward and visible demon∣stration of their agency and power among Men Whereas at other times and in other places where ignorance of a con∣trary nature has prevailed and Men have been subjected to  superstitious  ter∣rors by neglecting the only proper ob∣ject of their confidence in such places I say the  Agency  and Interference of DEMONS with  Mankind  have ever been notorious and manifest of which the histories of all Heathen nations bear ample testimony  The uniformity of  Demon Worship  in all parts of the world before the preach∣ing of the Gospel affords also a clear proof of the worldly  Empire of Satan  for though Devils were worshipped under various names and various figures yet there was a constant uniformity in all such particular points as tended most to  the Destruction of Mankind  or to lead Men to the most direct opposition to the revealed Laws of God whereby the universal Author or Promoter of such baneful devices was clearly discoverable the same being for the most part con∣trary to the  Nature of Man  and such therefore as could not  naturally  pro∣ceed from  Man  alone  Hence we may plainly account for the universal adoption of  Human Sacri∣fices  amongst  all Heathen Nations  Some of these deluded people withheld not even their own offspring from their  Spiri∣tual  Deceiver  the spilling of  Human Blood  being most grateful to that  Being  who "  was a  MURDERER  from the be∣ginning  "  Ye are of your Father the Devil and the lusts of your Father ye will do  He was a Murderer from the beginning  and abode not in the Truth because there is no Truth in him When he speaketh a Lie he speaketh of his own for he is a Liar and the Father of it  John viii  Hence we may also account for  the Cuttings in the Flesh for the dead  and the marking or  tattooing  of the skin which still prevails amongst the African and American nations and the present uninformed Islanders of the South Seas as much as it formerly did amongst the Picts and other more ancient Hea∣thens for their  marks in the flesh  were certainly intended by the Spiritual De∣ceiver as a sort of  Dedication to him∣self  I have been informed by an Englishman who lived many years amongst the Indians in the internal parts of North America very far to the westward and who  is himself  tatooed  with all the marks of distinction com∣mon to the nations with whom he has had any connec∣tions that he once saw a party of Indians who had taken some prisoners in war tatoo a couple of their unfortu∣nate captives with the most curious marks they could devise and afterwards hang them up upon a tree as a sacrifice to that  infernal Being  which they worshipped saying at the same time in their language that they hoped those  two fine Men  viz finely tatooed whom they presented would be acceptable to him for though the Indians in general acknowledge that there is a  God  whom they call the  Great and Good Spirit  yet through the de∣lusions of the Devil they think it more profitable to wor∣ship  Evil Spirits  by way of propitiation lest they should hurt them  Outre l'idée du premier Estre qu'ont les Sauvages  says Father Lafitau speaking of the American Savages  et

that were bound  contrary to Nature  in vows of CELI∣BACY and amongst the  Heathen  Tar∣tars Chinese and other idolaters even to this day  The celebrated Venetian  Father  MARK PAUL in the account of his Travels through the East speaking of the territories of the  Great Cham of Tartary  informs us  that there are  MANY MONKS  appointed to the worship of idols who have a great  MONASTERY

Angara  which rises from the lake of  Bakal  says  On one side of this town likewise there stands a  FINE MONASTERY  or  CONVENT  on that particular spot where the river  JAKUT  from whence it derives its name empties its waters into the  ANGARA  Extract from Mr  Isbrants Ides  Travels inserted in the English edition of Mons  Le Brun  's Travels p In  the following page mention is made of the  Mongulian Devotees  and he describes a  Mongulian  NUN as well as a LAMA or  Priest  Whilst the envoy resided in this place he met with a Taischa that is to say a Mongulian or Mogulian lord who had th  own himself under the shelter and protection of the Czar of Moscovy and had been for some time a proselyte to the Christian faith and received a member of the Greek church  This young nobleman had a sister who was a  Mongulian nun  and was greatly inclined to become a Christian c  nvert a  well as her brother In conversation upon that serious and important topic she would ingenuously acknowledge that the God in whom the Christians put their trust and confidence must of necessity in her opinion be an omnipotent God indeed since he had expelled their Mongulian deity out of paradise but she was firmly persuaded that a time would come when he should be restored    a proof this that the  MONGULIAN NUNS are Pagans "and never be subject to the like disgrace again  When any of these NUNS or MONGULIAN DEVOTEES enter into a room they never salute any person present whom∣soever tho' 'tis a customary thing with their ladies who live un∣der no restraint since their order is too strict to

CUSTOMARY AMONGST THE MONGULIANS AS WELL AS THE CALMUCS This priest by the incessant practice of this branch of devotion had wore his thumb his nail and the joints of his fingers to that degree that he had perfectly lost the sense of all feeling in them  Le Brun's Travels p  from whence it is natural to conclude that the monastery or convent beforementioned belonged to one or the other of these

have  a long  black robe  and  square cap  and walk with a  Paternefter  or  Rosary  that is a string of beads in their hands The women or NUNS have  separate monasteries  shave their hair and REJECT

must beg leave to add a similar testimony even of a learned Jesuit  Athanasius Kircher  who in his  China Illustrata  p makes particular mention of a MONASTERY of idolatrous  Chinese  Priests or  Bonzes  at the city of  Camsan  and in his account of the Japanese idols p he informs us that the Japanese believe that their idol  Amida  requires nothing of them to incline him to save them except a FREQUENT REPETITION of the word  Namu Amida Buth  that is  "Happy Amida save us"  Compare this with the vain repetitions of the  Popish Rosary  And when they repeat these words they also use their  Rosaries  or  Strings of Prayer Beads  which the  Japanese  says he  have in common with the Christians  and  which are commonly painted in the hands of their idols as you see  says he  in the annexed picture which shews the representation of  AMIDA  and every way corresponds with the figure of  PUSSA  the goddess of the  CHINESEIllos huic idolo tantum tribuere ut ad salvandum se nihil aliud

an  Adversary Hater  or  Enemy  is  Satan    which name was generally applied by the Jews to the  Spiritual Enemy  in particular and it is remarkable that many of the Heathen Tartars worship the  Devil  under that very name to this day  The author last quoted respecting the Tartar  Devotees  tells us in page concerning the idols of  the Ostiachs  that  these idols are called  SAITANS  a name which seems to derive its origin from  SATAN  the arch fiend of Hell  And in page speaking of the people of BARA∣BINSY who are a kind of CALMUCS he says  When they traverse the woods in order to hunt down their game they take their  Saitan  as they call it along with them which is an image made of wood inele∣gantly carved with a knife only and covered with a particoloured stuff not unlike that which is frequently worn by the female Russians This idol or  Saitan  of theirs is inclosed in a box which is carried upon  a particular sledge and to this their god they offer up the firstfruits of their chace be it what it will with∣out any exception  When they prove more successful than they could reasonably expect and when safely arrived at their re∣spective cabbins this  Saitan  or idol is deposited in the most conspicuous part of their tent or hut in its proper box and covered over with the finest furs they are masters of by way of grateful acknowledgment of the great success they have met with through their means and there they are left untouched till they are grown rotten and worthless in process of time for they are firmly convinced that they should be guilty of the most heinous sin of sacrilege should they strip them of those robes or apply them to any other purpose whatsoever  and yet the same  De∣ceiver  promoted almost universally a∣mongst the Heathen as a  sacred Rite  the promiscuous use of Woman in order to draw Men by their  natural Lusts  to  join the superstitious Congregations of his Worshippers  Of this kind were the Rites of Venus among the Greeks Romans and more particularly among the inhabitants of Cyprus  The young women here used to prostitute themselves to such strangers as came ashore in order to raise money for their portions  Univ Hist Vol p  the

of a bloody hue as at certain times it did  The cause of this red face of the river was anciently known and by those who were not so superstitious as the rest of their cotemporaries and countrymen ascribed to a kind of  Minium  or red earth which this river brought away when it swelled to an unusual height It is still subject to the same appearance in the time of floods  For which he quotes Mr Maundrel's Travels Univ Hist Vol p  The lamentations of a mother for the loss of her only son could not be more loud or tender they then proceeded TO THE SACRIFICES OF THE DEAD having first

both to body and soul for the  Midianitish  woman that  prostituted herself to  Zimri  the Sime∣onite and was killed together with her captivated Israelitish paramour by  Phi∣neas  is expressly declared to have been the daughter of Zur  By whose consent no doubt  says Bishop Pa∣trick  she went upon this wicked design that by her noble garb and attendance she might the more power∣fully intice the great men of  Israel  to idolatry  who was  HEAD OVER A PEOPLE  and of a  CHIEF HOUSE  in Midian  Numb xxv And he is mentioned  after∣wards  as one of THE KINGS  of Midian  Numb xxxi  Thus  "the Council of Balaam"  pro∣moted the service and worship of  Devils  and this should warn us of the extreme danger of yielding to the crime of  For∣nication  which in all ages and nations has been used as a snare to vilify man∣kind and enslave them to  Spiritual Ad∣versaries  for as THE FORBIDDING TO MARRY is unquestionably THE DOC∣TRINE  OF DEVILS see p preceding whereby those who devote themselves to such  unnatural  commands fall under more severe  Temptation to  FORNICA∣TION  When Pope  Gregory  VII  Hildebrand  removed the  married Priests  in the year from officiating in the church service and forbid the laity to hear them say mass the numbers of  Monkish  or  unmarried  clergy were of course increased and the scandal of  Incontinence  the necessary effect of  "forbidding to marry"  became noto∣rious of which even the  Monk Matthew Paris  bears ample testimony  Porrò  PAUCIS CONTINENTIAM OBSER∣VANTIBUS  aliquibus cam causa lucri ac jacantantiae simu∣lantibus multis  INCONTINENTIAM  perjurio multiplici∣ori  ADULTERIO  cumulantibus  M Paris Hist Angl p And afterwards in the reign of Henry I anno when Archbishop  Anselm  excommunicated the  mar∣ried Priests  whom he maliciously called  Sacerdotes con∣cubinarios  as if their lawful  wives  were no better than  concubines  there were not wanting some prudent persons even in those  dark days  to declare the  immoral  tendency of the measure as M Paris testifies "This"  says he speaking of the said excommunication of mar∣ried Priests  seemed good to some and to others  DANGE∣ROUS  lest while they aim at  PURITY  greater than their strength they should fall into worse  UNCLEANNESS  Hoc autem bonum quibusdam visum est et quibusdam  PERICULO∣SUM  ne dum mundicias viribus majores expeterent in  IMMUNDITIAS LABERENTER DETERIORES M Paris Hist Angl p    a remarkable example of which he gives us in the person of  Cardinal John de Creme  Anno Domini MCXXV  Johannes  Cremensis Apostolicae sedis Cardinalis de

clergy in London in the reign of Henry II against  married Priests  and therein bitterly exclaiming against the  monstrous wickedness of rising from the side of a whore  for so he affected to call the vir∣tuous wife of a Priest to  perform Mass  was himself de∣tected  that very evening in a real  brothel  The affair was so VERY NOTORIOUS says M Paris that it could not be denied whilst the Cardinal exchanged great honour into profound disgrace  so on the other hand  FORNICATION is reciprocal in its effects by being one of the most baneful ob∣stacles to lawful and virtuous MARRI∣AGE and consequently to the increase and multiplication of mankind but this bad as it is is not the worst con∣sequence of habitual FORNICATION for men being thereby drawn away from the service and worship of their Creator  are gradually led to  greater crimes  whereby their minds are more and more  darkened  like those of the  fallen Angels  until they are totally deprived of the  Light  and  Image  of their Creator and lose both temporal and eternal Happi∣ness  When Men are IN BONDAGE  to their own Lusts  there is no doubt but that Satan has already  "got an Advantage"  over them and by  their Lusts  and unrestrained Affections does hold them IN BONDAGE also  to himself  So that a Man cannot free himself from  Spiritual  Bondage without forsaking and repent∣ing of his favourite sins for we can have no direct idea of  resisting  the  Devil  as the Scriptures command us but that of  resisting Evil  wherever we perceive it whether in thoughts words or actions But when Men entirely neglect this ne∣cessary resistance to  Evil  they are sure  to be led on from one vice to another till the two beforementioned natural and  universal Principles  in Mankind in∣tended for their  Preservation  viz  Com∣mon Sense  or  Reason  and  Selflove  have lost their influence for the  Actions  of of a great part of Mankind cannot be accounted for upon any other  Principle  than that of a  lamentable  BONDAGE  to the  SPIRITUAL ADVERSARY who leads them to actions that are clearly contrary to  Selflove  and  Common Sense  and con∣trary even to any probable gratification that might afford a  Temptation  to Hu∣man Beingsto actions that apparently tend to their own everlasting destruction  How common is it for Men to lift their hands against their own life and deliberately to exclude themselves from all possibility of repentance It must be allowed indeed that real  Madness  or Lunacy and other  natural  distempers  and frenzies are frequently the  Princi∣ples of Action  which occasion Suicide but we have too many instances of  de∣liberate Selfmurder  wherein no such  natural  causes can with justice be al∣ledged though generally assigned by the coroner's juries through a false notion of mercy which inclines them to adopt the erroneous maxim that  all Men are mad who kill themselves  But nothing is more false  If the Brute Creation were equally liable to voluntary deaths  Suicide  might with more probability be attributed to natural causes  only  as they are almost equally liable to  distempers  but herein appears a capital distinction between  Human Nature  and that of  Brutes  None of the BRUTE CREATION ever violate the  universal Principle  of SELFLOVE which the Divine  Author of Na∣ture  has given them for their preserva∣tion  And though MAN is also endowed with the  same Principle  as I have already shewn yet  the very  BRUTES make so much better use of it  than  MAN that in them we distinguish the  same Principle  even by another name and call it IN∣STINCT  an  INSTINCT  of Selfpreser∣vation  an  Instinct  because it is never violated How are we to account for this seeming Superiority in the BRUTES Why should HUMAN NATURE be more subject to Depravity than they are MAN who in addition to that  natural Light  with which he was endowed at the time of his Creation has since ac∣quired an additional power of discern∣ment and prudence for his preservation even a  Divine Knowledge  of GOOD and EVIL that he  may know how to refuse the  EVIL  and chuse the  GOOD  and yet is in general infinitely more depraved than the very BRUTES Let any rea∣sonable Man consider how impossible it  is by  natural Causes  to account for so extraordinary a circumstance That MAN endowed with such a Superiority of  Knowledge  for SELFPRESERVATION and also endowed with  Selflove  in com∣mon with the rest of the Creation should yet be subject to such monstrous Depravity as to lose all sense of both while the BRUTES are never known to violate that universal Principle  Selflove  except it be for  a reasonable Cause  that they risk  their own Lives  in defence of their young to preserve their species or through gratitude as Dogs will de∣fend their masters which surely is no Depravity To what extraordinary cause then shall we attribute this very singular superiority of BRUTES in a circumstance so necessary to happiness The cause is obvious BRUTES have never been sub∣ject to  spiritual Delusions  or to be actuated by  infernal Spirits  since the time that the Serpent deceived our first parents  There is no instance I believe since that time of BRUTES being really  actu∣ated by evil Spirits  except one and that was be pleased to observe by  express Permission  of  our  LORD  himself  viz when the Devils entered into the swine by the lake of Gennesareth For it appears that the  Demons  had no power to enter into the animals till our Lord had ex∣pressly granted it for  the Devils  BESOUGHT HIM  saying If thou cast us out  SUFFER US  to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them Go  THE PERMISSION being thus gained the animals immediately ac∣quired a new  "Principle of Action"  too similar to that which actuates poor aban∣doned sinners among MEN as when  the Devil  entered  Judas  and led him not only to betray his Lord but to punish the horrid treason  with his own hands  contrary to every conceivable  Natural Principle of Action  so the unhappy Brutes  by Gennesareth were no sooner subjected  like Mankind  to the Bondage of  infernal Spirits  than they immediately lost that Principle of  Selflove  which in them because never violated but at this par∣ticular time is called  Instinct  and by the immediate consequence of that loss they have afforded us a notable example of the baneful effects of  Diabolical In∣spiration  This particular case of  the Gadarene Demoniacks  has been violently attacked by the opposers of the com∣mon received doctrine concerning  the Reality of Demoniacal Possessions  Three very eminent and learned men among them for instance have endeavoured to accommodate to their own notions the evangelical history of this matter and by the failure of their several attempts have proved that the  literal meaning  of the terms in which the Evan∣gelists have related the several circumstances of that case and no less than three Evangelists out of the four have mentioned it cannot possibly be set aside without raising up in its stead the most glaring absurdities One of these gentlemen notwithstanding his own errors has very fully and justly censured the miserable shift to which the other two learned men were reduced in attempting to defend their own groundless hypothesis  A farther argument  says he  in favour of  REAL POS∣SESSIONS  is taken from the destruction of the herd of swine which the  DEMONS  are said to have entered and stimu∣lated to instantaneous madness This case is considered by some'  continues he  'as a decisive proof of the power of Demons both over the human and  BRUTAL RACE  This conclusion is expressed in too general terms The example is indeed "  a decisive Proof of the Power of Demons over the  BRUTAL RACE" whenever  Demons  can obtain the Divine Permission to enter  Brutes  but without such EXPRESS PERMISSION the case itself sufficiently demonstrates as I have remarked above for otherwise the  asking  and  granting  PERMISSION to enter the swine would be but vain circumstances that they have NO POWER over the  Brutal Race  The case is very different with  Human Bodies  which I have already shewn  and is thought even to have been purposely designed by Provi∣dence to refute the opposite opinion To enervate this argu∣ment  DR SYKES  suggested and  DR LARDNER  strenu∣ously contended that  THE SWINE WERE FRIGHTED BY THE TWO MADMEN AND SO DRIVEN DOWN THE PRECIPICE INTO THE SEA  On the other hand'  says he  'the advocates for the common hypothesis insist upon it to my apprehension'  continues he  'with great reason that  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR TWO MEN HOWEVER FIERCE TO PUT SO VAST A HERD OF SWINE AS TWO THOUSAND INTO MOTION IN AN INSTANT AND TO CAUSE THEM ALL TO RUSH WITH VIOLENCE DOWN A PRECIPICE INTO THE SEA SWINE CON∣TRARY TO THE NATURE OF MOST OTHER ANIMALS RUNNING DIFFERENT WAYS WHEN THEY ARE  DRIVEN  But this part of the controversy might well be spared it not appearing from the history that the men ever fell upon the herd or made any attempt to drive them into the sea Nay the history expressly refers their destruc∣tion to a different cause from the behaviour of the madmen  "An Essay on the Demoniacks of the New Testament" P  Many other insurmountable objections are alledged by the same ingenious writer and may be seen at large in pages to if what I have already quoted should not be thought amply sufficient to confute the  groundless supposition  of the other two learned men And he very justly concludes thereupon  For these rea∣sons  says he  I cannot accede to the opinion of those learned writers who ascribe the destruction of the swine to the madmen  But then unfortunately for himself he immediately adds  Neither  says he  can I see any just ground for ascribing it to  THE AGENCY OF DE∣MONS  P  He tells us elsewhere that  what is called the ejection of  DEMONS  is the case of a natural disorder  p and    that there never was nor can be a real Demoniack  ' p 'that the  DEMONIACKS  spoken of in the New Tes∣tament were  ALL  either  MADMEN  or epilepticks  Prop  vi p  And with respect to the particular case before us 'he asserts that  all that can he inferred from their  the Evangelists  saying  that  the Demons came out of the Men and entered into the herd of swine  is that the madness of the former was transferred to the latter in the  same sense as  the leprosy of Naaman was to cleave to Ge∣hazi and to his seed for ever  P  He allows however  what a learned writer  says he  contends for that in the case before us  the power of imagination could have no place  Dr Warburton p  It was never said that the swine  FAN∣CIED  themselves possessed their disorder I admit  says this author  was  REAL  but not therefore  DEMONIACAL  So great a miracle as that wrought upon them  continues he  can be ascribed to no other  AGENCY  than that of  GOD  P  Certain it is that no created Being whatsoever whe∣ther  good  or  evil visible  or  invisible  can have any power to act without the  Knowledge  and  Permission  of the AL∣MIGHTY but at the same time we must remember that there is a very material difference between  the  AGENCY  of God  and the PERMISSION of God God is indeed said to do what he only  permits  as I have elsewhere remarked see notes in pages to and he sometimes grants his  Permission  to very unworthy AGENTS both  spiritual  and  temporal  which act with views and intentions very opposite to the actual purposes of God that are really  effected  by their  Actions  for the histories of all nations sufficiently testify that even the  vices  and  malicious dispositions  of the enemies both to  God  and  Man  are frequently  permitted  to act  as Instruments  of DIVINE VENGEANCE see my Tract on the  Law  of Retribution pages and elsewhere to promote the  eternal Justice  and  Glory  of the ALMIGHTY as he alone can bring  Good  out of  Evil  But in all such cases wherein there is manifest evidence of  Evil  in the production of events though the same are certainly by the  Sufferance  or  Permission  of God yet it would be highly injurious to truth to ascribe the AGENCY to GOD  In the case before us concerning the  Gadarene Demo∣niacks  the PERMISSION and the AGENCY are clearly distinguished by the Evangelists in the most express terms  So the  DEMONS  besought him saying if thou cast us out  SUFFER US  to go away into the herd of swine And he said unto them  Go  Matth viii    And all the  DEMONS  besought him saying Send us into the swine that we may enter into them And forthwith  JESUS GAVE THEM LEAVE  Mark v    And they  the Demons  besought him  Jesus  that he would  SUFFER THEM  to enter into then  the herd of swine  and  HE SUFFERED THEM  Luke viii  Thus the DIVINE PERMISSION is clearly and distinctly declared and the same faithful historians leave us as little room for doubt concerning the AGENTS in this matter for  when they'  the DEMONS  'were come out they entered into the swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters  Matth viii    And the  UNCLEAN SPIRITS  went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place  c  Mark v  Then went the  DEMONS  out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down c  Luke viii  Here is the most EXPRESS EVIDENCE of three Evan∣gelists that DEMONS or UNCLEAN SPIRITS  entered into the swine  and the consequences of that  entering  are as clearly noted  the animals rushed headlong to their own apparent destruction  A circumstance which was  never  known to happen either before or since that time to  any Brute Animals  whatsoever so that it is unreasonable to attribute that singular deprivation of  Natural Instinct in Brutes  to  "a Natural Disorder"  because the circum∣stances of it must necessarily be allowed to have been totally  unnatural to Brutes  though with mankind alas it is far otherwise for we have almost daily examples of men that are absolutely actuated with the same  violent desire to rush headlong out of the world  But the reason of of this remarkable difference between  Men  and  Brutes  I have already I hope sufficiently explained  Now if it is unreasonable to attribute this singular destruction of  Brute Animals  to  a Natural Disorder  it is much more unreasonable nay it will appear profane and blasphemous to say that it  can be ascribed to no other  AGENCY  than that of  GOD  when we consider that the  Demons  which are said to have entered the swine were not  mere nullities  as this author supposes not a mere name for deceased Souls or  the Souls of  DEAD MEN but are expressly declared by the Evangelist Mark to be UN∣CLEAN SPIRITS  Mark v For if the  Sin against the Holy Ghost  the most unpardonable of all Blasphemies consisted as many learned commentators have supposed in attributing the  the  Works of  GOD to "  Beelzebub  the  Prince of Demons"  surely it must be almost equally dangerous to  ascribe to the Agency of  GOD the  furious and profane agitations  occa∣sioned by the inspiration of  unclean Spirits  But I impeach not  the intention  of the learned author but only the tendency of his doctrines his excuse how∣ever is already prepared he doubts in page  whe∣ther these epithets  EVIL and UNCLEAN given by the Evangelists to the SPIRITS ejected by Christ  express their  PERSONAL DISPOSITIONS  or only those  EFFECTS  they were supposed to produce  nay even  CacoDemon with him is "not a  wicked Demon"  See note in p And he tells us in another part of his work p that  Infirmities plagues  and EVIL SPIRITS  seem to be mentioned only as so many distinct species of  DISEASES  These suppositions for they are merely such may seem at first sight to afford some excuse for his  ascribing to the Agency of  GOD  the declared effects of  unclean  SPIRITS  But his error has still a deeper root he has in another tract  "An Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ's Temptation in the Wilderness" d Edit enlarged  '  ascribed to the Agency of  GOD' that which no less than three Evangelists have  expressly  registered amongst the transactions of the  Devil himself  I mean the  temptation of Christ by the Devil in the wil∣derness  and he roundly exculpates  Satan  from the charge  There was no real Presence  or AGENCY of SATAN says he ON THIS OCCASION  p  and that  the DEVIL  was not really and personally present with Christ but only in mental representation and consequently could act no part in this whole transaction  P  and yet all this is carried on in such smooth  language and with such seeming plausibility that the author himself is apparently deluded by his own sophistry and mistaken conclusions  After a great deal of sophistry in p to in comparing the Evangelists account of the  Temptation  with several expressions in  Eze∣kiel  and St  John  relating to the Revelations of  the Spirit  viz as that  'the Spirit took me up'lifted me up and took me away'    I was in the Spirit    'He carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness'  c he boldly concludes thereupon in p  Thus  says he  from  the EXPRESS TESTIMONY  of the  THREE  several Evangelists  it ap∣pears  that Christ was conveyed into the wilderness  IN A PROPHETICK VISION TRANCE or EXTACY  under the afflatus or inspiration of the Spirit of God  But where has he shewn  the EXPRESS TES∣TIMONY of the  three  several Evangelists that Christ was  conveyed in  A VISION  He cannot shew that even  one  of the  three  has  once  used any such EXPRESSION or even the least insinuation about a VISION on that occasion Though the EXPRESSIONS of  Ezekiel  and St  John  relate to  Revelations received in the way of  VISIONS yet that does not prove that all similar expressions wherein the  Spirit  is said to  lift up  or  take away  must necessarily be understood as VISIONS If his argument  proved  any thing at all it would prove too much Let us suppose it for once to be perfectly conclusive and apply it to that text in the Acts of the Apostles where we read that  the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip  and afterwards that he was  found at Azotus  shall we say then to argue like our critic that'  this 'passage of Scripture is to be understood as a history not of a fact but of a  VISION p and that it appears "  from the  EXPRESS TESTIMONY" of the text though the  text  contains not a single word about a VISION TRANCE or EXTACY any more than the texts of the three Evangelists do about the supposed VISION of Christ that Philip was  conveyed  in a VISION that is his removal was  not  REAL  and  CORPOREAL  but  SPIRITUAL  and  MENTAL  only  p  notwithstanding that the  text  afterwards asserts it as a FACT that he was FOUND AT AZOTUS  The circumstances of this transaction necessarily oblige us to under∣stand that the operation of THE SPIRIT upon  Philip  when he was "CAUGHT AWAY was not  visionary  but REAL and it will ap∣pear upon further examination that a similar  necessity  of literal inter∣pretation is  equally  included in the circumstances of the other case also Now  "if the Spirit of the Lord"  REALLY  "caught away Philip"  from the sight of the eunuch in the desart and left him at  Azotus  there is no absurdity in supposing that our Lord himself might also REALLY be  led" by  or  in    the Spirit into the wilderness  and that the history must  necessarily  be so under∣stood will I trust be hereafter shewn That it was no unusual thing for the Prophets of God to be actually  "led"    "carried"  or "  caught away" by  or  inthe Spirit  is manifest from the ap∣prehension of such a  carrying by the Spirit  expressed by the generous and faithful  Obadiah  governor of king  Ahab  's house when  Elijah  required him to acquaint his master where he might find him Kings xviii and the opinion of  Obadiah  with respect to the true meaning of such  expressions  is certainly to be preferred before the sentiments of the author of the  "Inquiry"  c or perhaps than the opinion of any other man whatever because  Obadiah  was not only per∣sonally acquainted with  Elijah  but also with a great  many other Pro∣phets of the Lord  having himself preserved the lives of more than one hundred of them by hiding and maintaining them in caves so that he could not be unacquainted with the occasional effects of the HOLY SPIRIT upon  Prophets  and therefore we may fairly conclude that his apprehension of the SPIRITS removing or  carrying the Prophet  to a different place was not without just foundation or example or at least not without probability especially as we read that  Elijah  was at last actually  taken away  in a miraculous manner which was equally attributed to  "the Spirit of the Lord"  by the sons of the Prophets at  Jericho    lest peradventure  said they THE SPIRIT OF THE  LORD HATH TAKEN HIM UP  and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley  Kings ii  And they cannot surely be be supposed to mean that  the Spirit of the Lord  had  taken him up  in a mere  trance  or  vision  for notwithstanding the  plain testimony of the Evangelists abovementioned con∣cerning  the Agency  of the  Devil  and  Satan  in that temp∣tation  As that he was '  led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of  THE DEVIL in which the AGENCY of  the Spirit  and the AGENCY of the  Devil  are clearly distinguished That Jesus said unto him the DEVIL '  Get thee hence  SATANand that 'then THE DEVIL N B the appellations  Satan  and the  Devil  are manifestly applied to the same wicked Being '  leaveth him  c Matth iv  And immediately the  SPIRIT  driveth him  Jesus  into the wilderness  And he was there  IN THE WILDERNESS forty days TEMPTED OF SATAN  and was with  THE WILD BEASTS c Mark i whereby the reality of our Lord's being  driven by the Spirit  INTO THE WILDERNESS is manifest for though the Author of the Enquiry asserts in pages and that  it appears by comparing the several Evangelists together that Christ had but just left the banks of  JORDAN  and therefore  WAS STILL IN  THE WILDERNESS  at the very time he is said to have been led into it  c yet that part of the  wilderness  where John baptized ceased  in effect  though not  in name  to be a  wilderness  whilst it was the place of publick resort for all  Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about Jordan  Mat iii Mark i  and therefore even supposing it true that Christ  was still in the wilderness at the very time he is said to have been led into it  we must necessarily understand that he was  led  to some more solitary part of the wilderness than that which had been for some time before the place of publick resort for the whole nation for otherwise he could not well be said to be "  there in the wilderness""with the wild beasts"  But when our author wrote the above assertion that "Christ  was still in the wilderness  c notwithstanding that the Evangelist Luke assures us  that he returned from Jordan  he seems to have forgot that the word  return  or  implies a going BACK  to some other place from whence he had lately come  and is used in that sense about thirtyfour times in the New Testament without a single exception so that it is much more prudent to believe the plain testimony of the Evangelist that Christ  "returned from Jordan"  that is  from  the place where he was baptized to some other place or at least was on his way to some other place than to believe the contradictory assertion of this critick that he  was still in the wilderness at the very time  he is said to have been led into it  yet our author is pleased to assert that it  is to be understood as a history not of a fact but of  A VISION  As such  says he  the writers of the Gospel  EX∣PRESSLY  represent it  by which it seems this learned author is so far blinded by hypothesis as to forget the true meaning of the word EXPRESSLY for not one of the writers of the Gospel have EXPRESSED the least idea about a VISION in that particular case and yet he asserts that they EXPRESSLY  represent it    without leaving us  says he  as the sacred penmen have been thought to do in other instances to collect it from the nature and circum∣stances of the relation They likewise  continues he  REPRESENT THIS VISION  he must mean this VI∣SION  of his own imaginationthis VISION of a VISION for the Evangelists cannot justly be charged with any such REPRESENTATION  not as  DIABOLICAL  but  DI∣VINE  ascribing it  says he  to the  SPIRIT OF GOD  "An Inquiry" c p  Now what shall we say to the assertions of this critick when we turn to the authority of the Evangelists themselves and find that they are so far from ascribing any such supposed VISION of a temptation to  the Spirit of God  that they  expressly  mention the  Devil  or  Satan  as the tempter and  do not  express  or  represent  a single word about a VISION in that particular case nevertheless our Commentator boldly adds to this monstrous perversion of evidence the following mockery of truth viz  So that to all the other arguments urged above  says he  we may add what we before promised to produce  THE AUTHORITY OF THE EVANGELISTS  whom he most notoriously contradicts  and  THE EXPRESS LETTER OF THE TEXT  which as notoriously contradicts him  in confutation  says he  of those who misconstrue Christ's temptation either as an outward transaction or as an illusion of Satan  Inquiry c p See also his proposition p    that all the Evangelists who have mentioned this affair do  IN EXPRESS TERMS  affirm that it passed  SPIRITUALLY  and  IN VISION  that it was  AN IDEAL OR MENTAL REPRESENTATION  and consequently could not be an outward transaction  Now "If such a method of explaining Scripture" as he himself censures others in p of his Essay on the Demoniacks c  "be allowed  language can be of no use"  He may think it a  generous action  perhaps to  excuse  or endeavour to  exculpate  an  Adversary  and more espe∣cially such an inveterate  Adversary  as  Satan himself  The author of the  Inquiry  c in p objects that  if the Evan∣gelical History of our Lord's Temptation is to be understood as a narrative  OF REAL FACTS c  it is unsuitable to the  SAGACITY  and  POLICY  of the Evil Spirit  cNow this would certainly be a good ar∣gument if we could suppose that the  Evil Spirit  is prompted by no other  Principles of Action  than SAGACITY and POLICY but alas he yielded himself a  Slave  as frail men do to  Principles  very op∣posite  to SAGACITY and POLICY or he would surely have  kept his first estate  and have still remained as originally created  an Angel of Light  And therefore with respect to the particular cir∣cumstances of Christ's temptation EXPRESSLY ascribed to the DEVIL or SATAN by three Evangelists we may reasonably conclude that our  Spiritual Adversary  was prompted to that unequal contest with Christ by the same predominant  Principles of Evil  viz PRIDE ENVY and FALSEHOOD that originally occasioned his  Fall from  GOD but now occasioned a much more mortifying abasement to Satanical Pride and Envy  a Defeat by  MANeven by  "the seed of the"  deluded and much injured  "Woman"    from the most  baneful  and  malicious  attempt that was ever made against the happiness of mankind But this  generosity  or whatever else it may be called  to the Enemy  is productive of consequences which the learned author had he been aware of them would not perhaps be willing to adopt for his doctrine of SATAN'S IN∣NOCENCE IN THIS MATTER viz that "  there was no real presence or  AGENCY OF SATAN  on this occasion  p that  the  DEVIL  was not really and personally present with  CHRIST  but only in mental representa∣tion and consequently could act no part in this whole transaction  p  and that the Evangelists  represent this  VISION    We have as little reason to affirm from the stile of the  Gospel  writers and the manner of their expressions that  Christ  's temptations are only'  "the history of a vision"  as we have to affirm that our Lord's restoring the lame to their feet the blind to their sight the lepers to their cleanness the diseased to  health and the dead to life was likewise all the history of what was transacted in a vision or that the whole Gospel account of what our Lord did upon earth is no more than the history of so many  visions  an account of what he saw' "in spiritual raptures by a prophetick afflatus and inspiration  'Hui quantam fenestram ad nequitiam patefeceris'  See p of a little Tract printed in intituled  Christ's Temp∣tations real Facts or a Defence  of the Evangelical History shewing that our Lord's temptations may be fairly and reasonably under∣stood as a narrative of what was really transacted  c wherein the reader will find many sensible and learned remarks in confutation of the novel doctrine propagated by the Author of the Inquiry  as he is pleased to call it  not as  DIABOLICAL  but  DIVINE  ascribing it to the  SPIRIT  of  GOD  p  This doctrine I say of SATAN'S INNOCENCE not only deprives Christ "  the Son of  MAN" of that actual triumph and victory which he gained in his HUMAN NATURE for the Restoration of  Mankind  over the temptations of  the Prince of this world  but it also necessarily implies that GOD him∣self was the  tempter  which if not downright blasphemy is at least a doctrine which is EXPRESSLY contradicted in Scripturefor there we read that  God cannot be tempted of Evil  NEITHER TEMPTETH HE ANY MAN  James i  And though there are several passages of Scripture wherein  God  is said to  tempt  As for instance we read in Genesis xxii that  God did  TENET  Abraham c  when he ordered him to offer up his only son for a burntoffering Yet this was not  a temptation to  SIN for men if the command had been actually executed the Patriarch would  not have sinned but on the contrary would have been  justified by his faith  in him that commanded whom he knew to be  the Creator  and  Lord of  LIFE and therefore the only rightful disposer of LIFE in all  creatures  but as the command was revoked just in so critical a time as to demonstrate the Patriarch's readiness to obey and yet to save the life of his son the command was so far from being a  tempta∣tion  to SIN that it was not on the part of the righteous Lord who  commanded  even a  temptation to  KILL because the event shewed that the command was not given with any  such intention  but merely to PROVE the Patriarch's  faith  and  obedience  The same Hebrew root  here rendered  did tempt  is frequently used in other pas∣sages of Scripture where it necessarily signifies to  prove  or  try  as in Exod xvi '  that I may  PROVE  them  '    whether they will walk in my law or no  And in Deut viii  that he might  PROVE  thee  "to do thee good"  c See also Judges vi Psa xxvi  c  yet they are all clearly to be understood in a different sense from  the  tempting  mentioned by the Apostle James which was  a tempting  or being  tempted  of EVIL apparently meaning a  temptation  to SIN  There is an expression however in Sam xxiv which without a further explanation would be very difficult to be reconciled with the text above cited from the Apostle James that  God cannot be tempted of Evil neither tempteth be any Man  for the text in Samuel seems at first sight to imply a  temptation  to SIN by the Al∣mightyAnd again  the anger of the  LORD  was kindled against Israel and  HE MOVED DAVID  against them to say  GO NUMBER ISRAEL  and  JUDAH  as if God himself had MOVED  David  to sin against Israel which might seem to give countenance to the doctrine of the Author of the  Inquiry into the Nature and Design of Christ's Tempta∣tion  viz that it is represented  not as  DIABOLICAL  but  DI∣VINE  ascribing it to the Spirit of God  and that  there was no  real Presence or  AGENCY  of  SATAN  on this occasion  p  But we are happily relieved from the difficulty by further information in another text concerning the real AGENT in that temptation or MOVING of  David  for we read in Chron xxi that  SATAN  stood up against Israel  and PROVOKED  David  or MOVED  David  for the same Hebrew word  is used in both texts  to number Israel  and therefore when this text is compared with the former wherein it is said that  God moved  David we must necessarily understand that  the moving  of David was indeed SUPERNATURAL  and  SPIRITUAL but that the real AGENT as the Action was  Evil  was the spiritual Enemy SATAN acting by God's  Permission  as a just judgment against Israel and also against David himself who at that time was probably so much elated by his temporal prosperity and successes as to forget that his absolute dependance ought to be upon God and not upon the  Number  of his subjects and certain it is that he was off his guard and neglected that necessary vigilance over his  thoughts  and  actions  which God requires of  all men  for otherwise he would have  resisted  the EVIL SUGGESTION of Satan whereas his yielding to it occasioned the  imputation  of sin  And in other passages where the latter or indeed any  spiritual influence of  EVIL whatever  is to be understood the  Evil Spirit  or real AGENT in the EVIL is generally mentioned and in that case the  Agency  cannot be  "ascribed to the Spirit of God"  without gross absurdity at least if not blasphemy even though the SPIRIT be expressly declared to be  "from the Lord"  as in the case of Saul related in Sam xvi where we read that  an Evil Spirit  FROM THE LORD  troubled him  Now this expression if we regard the literal meaning of it clearly implies not only that the  Evil Spirit  came by the  Permission of  GOD as it was  an Evil Spirit  FROM THE LORD  but also that the said Evil Spirit was really "THE AGENT" which  troubled  Saul  The same ingenious writer has attempted to set aside the literal meaning of this text also by attributing Saul's disorder to  "a deep melancholy"  meaning thereby a mere  natural disorder  without any  supernatural spiritual influence  for if he admitted the latter as the  cause of Saul's melan∣choly  he must necessarily give up his whole hypothesis but the futility of such a supposition shall be clearly shewn hereafter in a separate Tract  on the Case of  Saul as I have already extended this note to a most unprecedented length but as the  "Law of Nature"  and  the Principles of Action in Man  cannot be understood without a com∣petent knowledge of those  Spiritual Beings  with which the minds of men are liable to be influenced I was obliged to take some notice of such contradictions to my general doctrine as had been previously published by the ingenious Author of the  Essay on Demoniacks  for I must acknowledge that I was not aware of them until my Tract was not only  finished  as I thought and sent to the press but was also more than half printed and therefore I hope my readers will excuse the irregularity of tacking  so long  a note to  so small  a Tract  to which at all other times  Mankind  alone are subjectedfor  be∣hold  says the text  the whole herd  of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters  Matth viii  Thus  the Influence of  EVIL SPIRITS became manifestly a  Principle of Action  in the poor  Brutes  which overpowered their  Natural Instinct of Selfpreser∣vation  and hurried them headlong to destruction and the cause being  known it is very natural to conclude when we see  similar Effects  in  Human  Beings that the same  "Principle of Action"  may perhaps have produced  them especially if there be no previous circumstances of  Distemper  or  Distraction  which may leave room to hope that  another Cause  might reasonably be assign∣ed  And as the example also shews us that Devils have no power to  enter Brutes  without  express Permission  of the Creator let us by a comparative consideration of  our own bodies learn to be continually upon our guard against the devices and  instigations of our spiritual Enemies always remembering that they need  no  such express Permission  from God to enter the  Human  Body or rather that God  has already lodged the Power of  permit∣ting  or  resisting  them entirely in the  Human Breast since we are by Nature continually liable to receive  the Inspira∣tion of the Devil and his Angels  as a  "Principle of Action"  if we neglect the  necessary Resistance  commanded in the Scriptures and consequently that they already have  Permission  from God to enter all Human Beings I mean all those as  are capable of discerning between  Good  and  Evil  and do not reject the  Evil  as they ought according to that  Divine Knowledge  which we inherit from our first Parents  This Peculiarity in our  Nature  is there∣fore apparently the reason why  Spiritual Adversaries  are permitted by the Al∣mighty to approach  Mankind  though they have no such  general Permission  with respect to the rest of the animal Creation But Man took the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  upon himself contrary to the ex∣press commands of God as I have be∣fore remarked and therefore we have no right to murmur at the Permission which God has granted to  the Devil and his Angels  to take possession of all unguarded Souls which unhappily yield to their suggestions and tempta∣tions without resistance or repentance and more especially we have no right to mur∣mur  I say at  this Permission  if we con∣sider that God has given us fair warning of our continual danger and warfare  with the Principalities and Powers of Darkness  as the Holy Scriptures plainly inform us that we are continually liable to Satanical influence and that the DEVIL will get an advantage over us if we do not resist him as we oughtIn this  necessary Resistance  and the objects of it consist the principal exercise of that assumed  Knowledge of Good and Evil  for which we are accountable viz we know  Evil  from  Good  and consequently know when we ought  to resist  but if we do not  resist  then we have  chosen the  EVIL and in whatsoever mode the EVIL is manifest have given  Advantage to the Devil  and submit ourselves to his  Bondage  The  Choice  therefore which is set before us amounts to thisWhether we will chuse  the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness  Mat vi  and cheerfully  assent  as the dignity of Human Nature requires to that  per∣fect Law of Liberty  which Christ has tendered to us for the regulation of our conduct towards  all Mankind  as well as for  Selfpreservation  orWhether we rather prefer the Empire of SATAN  the spiritual Enemy  for the sake of those temporal gratifications and vile indul∣gences by which he holds Men  in Bon∣dage  through their carnal affections till they become  personal Enemies even to themselves  The assumed Principle of  knowing Good and Evil  will undoubtedly in∣duce all Mankind most readily to CHUSE  the Kingdom of God and his Righteous∣ness  Mat vi  but this is not a CHOICE to be made merely  once in our lives  but to be  continually maintained  or the prudent CHOICE will avail nothing Are not Men in general bound by a so∣lemn oath in the outward rite of  WaterBaptism  thus to  maintain  that prudent CHOICE which they publickly profess And yet how little do their practices in general correspond with such a resolu∣tion Surely  the Mammon of Unright∣eousness  Luke xvi  the  PRINCE  of this World  that had been  cast out  John xii  the Principalities Powers  and  Rulers of the Darkness of this World  not FLESH AND BLOOD  with whom we  have to  WRESTLE do apparently prevail over a great multitude in every rank of life For  this is the Condemnation that Light is come into the World and Men loved  DARKNESS  rather than  LIGHT  a lamentable  Choice  a shameful prostitution of the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  but the Apostle assigns the reason  because  says he  their Deeds were  EVIL  For every one that doeth  EVIL  hateth the  LIGHT  neither cometh to the  LIGHT  lest his Deeds should be reproved But  he that doeth the Truth cometh to the  LIGHT  that his Deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought  IN GOD  John iii to  Let us therefore be upon our guard and  put on the whole Armour of God that  we  may be able to stand against the  WILES OF THE DEVIL  Ephes vi  But though Human Nature is thus liable to the Influence of  the Devil and his Angels  let us remember at the same time for our comfort that it  is equally capable  of being actuated by DIVINE INSPIRATION and that Man∣kind in the glorious FREEDOM of the Gospel are equally left to  their  CHOICE for the admission of that supreme Good "THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST" to regulate their  Principles of Action  in all cases as they are for the admission of the contrary Spirit  the Prince of Darkness  For  the Promises of  CHRIST relating to that  heavenly Gift  are clear  and absolute and are tendered to all Mankind without exception that they may exercise their  natural Knowledge of  GOOD  and  EVIL in CHUSING ACCEPT∣ING and  continually  CLAIMING them if they really prefer  "the Kingdom of God"  to  "the Kingdom of this World"  Here is true Freedom a Charter of inestimable  Privileges  ASK  and it shall be  GIVEN YOU SEEK  and ye shall  FIND  knock and it shall be  OPENED  unto you c  Mat vii  And again  "All things whatsoever ye shall  ASK IN PRAYER  be∣lieving ye shall receive"  Mat xxi and Mark xi And after these ge∣neral promises our Lord appealed to  the common Sense  of his hearers concerning the efficacy of a son's request to a  natural Father  to obtain things that are neces∣sary for him and concludes thereupon  If ye then being  EVIL  know how to give  GOOD GIFTS  to your Children  HOW MUCH MORE  shall your heavenly Father  GIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT  to  them that  ASK HIM  Luke xi to  So that every Man who de∣voutly and with due Faith claims that glorious GIFT according to  the Promise  and with such a disposition of mind as the Scriptures require will undoubtedly receive it  "for he is faithful that pro∣mised"  Heb x  I am well aware how uncommon it is to introduce these religious topicks into  Tracts of Law  but as  the Divine Influ∣ence of  THE HOLY SPIRIT  upon Man∣kind  may certainly be esteemed  the su∣preme "Principle of Action in Man"  I am obliged by the nature of my sub∣ject to cite some testimonies concerning the general effect of that heavenly Gift to which all Mankind are entitled for such is the  compound Nature of Man  that Enquiries concerning  Human Nature  and  the Principles of Hu∣man Actions  cannot be fairly and  carefully defined without a careful exa∣mination of this  Human Claim  to DIVINE INSPIRATION nor indeed without a careful warning also against that very opposite and foreign  Spiritual Influence  which is equally liable to alter  Human Nature  and become  the Principle of Action  which I hope I have already sufficiently proved from Scripture And therefore with respect to the former viz the  inestimable Claim to Divine Inspiration  which we hold in CHRIST it is proper to be remarked that the peculiar and necessary Effect of that  glorious and hea∣venly Gift  is a total change in the  Nature of Man  from his fallen State before described to  A NEW CREA∣TURE  by  a Regeneration  or  New Birth  through THE SPIRIT to which God has also been pleased to annex as necessary on our  first publick Admission  to the Claims and Privileges of the Gospel  an outward visible Sign  also or  typical Washing with  Water  VerilyVerily I say unto thee  said our Lord to the Jewish Ruler Nicodemus  Except a Man be born of  WATER  and of  THE SPIRIT  he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God  John iii  Here are two distinct articles expressly mentioned by our Lord as ne∣cessary to salvation viz st  Water  by which we outwardly profess our Faith  in the Name of the Father  and  of the Son  and  of the Holy Ghost  upon our first admis∣sion into Christ's church for that is the  Form  of Baptism afterwards expressly ordained by Christ himself Matt xxviii and dly  the Holy Spirit  which we claim of  the Father  in the name and through the merits  of the Son  so that Faith in all the Three Divine Persons is un∣doubtedly necessary to constitute that  Spiritual Regenera∣tion  without which no Man can enter into  the Kingdom of God  and as FAITH therefore must precede we may clearly perceive the reason why WATER the outward sign of initiation to the publick profession of that necessary FAITH is first mentioned  by which we bear a publick or outward testimony of that  true Faith  which alone can qualify our claim to the pro∣mise  Thus Man through the privileges of the Gospel becomes "A NEW CREA∣TURE" Cor v and partakes even of THE DIVINE NATURE if his  own earnest and sincere endeavours are not wanting for the Apostle PETER has expressly declared that this is one of the effects of our Lord's most gra∣cious promises  Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you  said the Apostle  through the Knowledge of  GOD  and of  JESUS OUR LORD  according as his  DIVINE POWER  hath given unto us all things that  pertain  unto Life and Godliness through the Knowledge of him that hath called us  TO GLORY  and  VIRTUE  whereby are given unto us  EXCEEDING GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES  that by these ye might be  PARTAKERS  of the  DIVINE NATURE  ΚΟΝΩΝΟΙ having escaped the Corruption that is in the World through Lust  Pet i to  Hence the Dignity and Superiority of MAN over the rest of the visible  Creation is manifest We not only pos∣sess by  natural Inheritance  from our first Parents a DIVINE ATTRIBUTE as I have already shewn in the former part of this Tract viz the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  but also by a right use of  that Knowledge  in CHUSING and pre∣ferring the  Good  and in REJECTING and  resisting  the  Evil  we are capable also  through  CHRIST of PARTAKING "  even of the  DIVINE NATURE" so that if we consider this most extraordi∣nary  Privilege  which is tendered to us on the one hand and that  deplorable Condition  on the other hand which we shall probably fall into if we neglect it viz the partaking of  the Diabolical Na∣ture  by the inspiration of the  Devil and his Angels  to which as I have already shewn we are continually liable if we do not watch and resist it must be be evident that MAN is either the  most  glorious  or the  most miserable  and  base  of all other Creatures  Surely the consideration of these things ought to humble the pride of those in∣considerate persons who on account of mere temporal honours and worldly possessions are so lifted up above their brethren as to forget that they have  no natural Precedency  but expect that the multitude of inferiors in fortune should implicitly submit to the will of the worldly superior in all things and who also seem to lose all sympathetick concern all sense of fellowfeeling for the wants and sufferings of their poor dependants as if they sprung from  a different Stock  and were not of EQUAL DIGNITY  in the  SIGHT OF GOD  But alas PRIDE is a  Principle of Action  which occasioned  the Fall  even  of  SATAN  himself  Tim iii  Lest being  PROUD  he fall into the Condemnation  or Judgment  of the  DEVIL  That is  says an old Commentator  by means of  PRIDE  and Highmindedness be cast into Hellfire in manner as the  DEVIL  is  by which  to my seeming  says he  it is plain what the sin of the  DEVILS  was namely an am∣bitious affecting aspiring unto and arrogating  DIVI∣NITY  to themselves not content with their own condition unto which very sin the  DEVIL  afterward by the serpent tempted Eve ministers being young men and young scho∣lars  continues this writer  by  PRESUMPTION AND PRIDE  are in no small danger of eternal destruction  Complete Christian Dictionary p  and of  his An∣gels  and is equally pernicious to  Hu∣man Nature  for it renders MANKIND more liable to forfeit that  glorious Liberty  those  inestimable Privileges  which I have before described than any other vice And the reason is plain for THE PROUD MAN of all others is most liable to neglect that "ROYAL LAW" which I have already mentionedthat GOLDEN RULE by which their notions of poli∣tical government and their behaviour to all Mankind ought to be regulated for if he was not guilty of this neglect he  would necessarily  cease  to be PROUD he would  cease  to be  uncharitable  he would  cease  to be  an Advocate for arbitrary Power  either in  political Despotism  or in  domestick Slavery  both of which now unhappily prevail almost throughout the whole world for even the enlightened  English Nation  is no longer qualified to censure the unnatural  Oppression  of the Peasantry and lower orders of people in  Russia Poland France  some Part of  Germany  and in many other States which are commonly called  Christian  since the  English  Government have pub∣lickly favoured and do continue to en∣courage the most abominable  Oppres∣sions  that ever disgraced Mankind I mean the AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE carried on from England and THE TOLERATION OF SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH COLONIES Let the Advo∣cates for these Oppressions seriously and carefully consider the DIGNITY and  EQUALITY of HUMAN NATURE which I have described as well as their own STATE OF PROBATION in this life and  the Forfeiture  of inestimable Privileges to which they are continually liable and I trust they will become sen∣sible of their danger  But alas there are many other causes of failure which tend to deprive Man∣kind of that  glorious and eternal Dignity  for which ALL MEN should be candi∣dates for besides the ordinary tempta∣tions of  worldly Pleasures  This is  the Condemnation  that Light is come into the world and Men loved Darkness rather than Light  because their deeds were evil  John iii  which draw the bulk of Mankind from con∣sidering the true means of obtaining the glorious promises of the Gospel how often are the minds of Men puffed up with  Selfsufficiency  and  the  PRIDE OF HUMAN LEARNING and too often  even with SPIRITUAL PRIDE whereby they suffer themselves to be perverted through the deceitfulness even of their own sophistry  How can such Men avail themselves of the glorious  Promise  of DIVINE IN∣SPIRATION as  "a Principle of Action"  if they form to themselves a  Mode  of  believing  which is totally different from  "the Faith once delivered to the Saints"  Perhaps they will say  We do ask the assistance of God's Holy Spirit and have as good a Right as others to sup∣pose that God's Promise is fulfilled in us  nevertheless they must allow that FAITH is necessary for those who ASK and how can Men be said to have the NECESSARY FAITH who form to themselves notions of God's HOLY SPI∣RIT which are totally inconsistent with the DIVINE NATURE  How can we conceive that  the  SPI∣RIT OF GLORY and OF GOD  Pet iv  resteth upon  those who wick∣edly esteem that glorious and  Eternal Spirit  Heb ix  no otherwise than as  a created Being  and a  mere mi∣nistering Spirit  and who refuse to join in that excellent Form of Prayer the Litany of the Church of England merely because THE HOLY GHOST is therein addressed AS GOD Is not this to do "  despite unto  THE SPIRIT  of Grace  Heb x  These Men may  pray  for the HOLY SPIRIT indeed but with such erroneous conceptions of that GLORIOUS GIFT  it is impossible  that they should RECEIVE that eternal "SPIRIT OF TRUTH" till they have sincerely repented of their horrid blasphemies and humbled their own  haughty Spirits  to receive the plain information of the  Scriptures  for if our  Belief in the HOLY TRINITY were set aside the greatest part of those sacred Writings would become utterly unin∣telligible to us because they must in that case seem to contain the grossest contradictions as there are passages which without that necessary doctrine would surely appear  inconsistent with grammar and common sense  The doc∣trine of the HOLY TRINITY is ex∣pressed in the Articles and Liturgy of  the Church of England  in such guarded terms as cannot easily be misconstrued and perverted and though a certain set of men may pretend to found their ob∣jections to  the Church of England  on some other Articles of less moment yet I am thoroughly persuaded that the said  guarded Terms  concerning  that  ONE  ne∣cessary Doctrine  are the principal causes of offence to many of those mistaken Clergymen who lately petitioned Parlia∣ment that they might be exempted from  Subscription  It is reasonable and just indeed that all men should be at  liberty  to teach and profess whatever religious opinions they think  most consistent with the Holy Scrip∣tures  if we except any publick promulgation of that religion which offends against the laws of  this nation  as a civil society by asserting a  foreign jurisdiction  and which has also unhappily adopted some  antichristian  rites of  idolatry sorcery  and  inchantments  But the petitioners cannot allege that they are not  already  AT LIBERTY to bear a publick testimony of their opinions and it would be dangerous even to the  true reli∣gion  were not SUCH LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE allow∣ed for supposing any material alteration should be per∣mitted to be made in the Articles and Liturgy of  the Church of England  a great majority perhaps of the pre∣sent churchmen might think themselves obliged to dissent and separate from what would then be called  the Esta∣blished Church  and would certainly think themselves in∣titled to a free toleration and a public use of  the present Liturgy  in their several separate congregations  I am therefore a sincere advocate for LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE but when a majority of the clergy and people have agreed upon the Articles of their Faith and established the same as the  National Profession of Religion  which it surely is while the  majority  continue of that opinion it is certainly no unjust restraint nor derogation from that NECESSARY LIBERTY abovementioned that those who are to be admitted public teachers of the  national Profession  should be required to  subscribe  a declaration  that they approve and will maintain the same For other∣wise the uniformity of doctrine would be banished from the pulpits and the peace of congregations would be continually disturbed by the broaching of undigested no∣tions diametrically opposite to the general and established opinions of the people and even the publick Form of Prayer would be reduced and moulded according to the caprice of every officiating minister for there can be no  Church Government  without a  written Test of Doctrine  couched in such terms as are least liable to misconstruction and equivocation The Catholick or Universal Church in  every age  and in  every place  hath ever had its  Tests of Doctrine  or particular  Creeds  to which the  assent  of all persons but more particularly the  assent of the clergy  was always required so that the  Church of England  is not singular in requiring the assent or subscription of those persons who desire to be admitted and authorized by the  National  Church as publick teachers and expounders of the Christian Faith  to the Articles of the  Church of England  But as a  right Faith  must seal and authenticate our claims to the inestimable privileges and immuni∣ties of the Gospel and as the  true Dignity of Human Nature  cannot be attained without the  Divine  Assistance and the Inspiration of God's  Holy Spirit  where∣by  Men  are made partakers as I have already shewn of the  Divine Nature  some knowledge of the latter so far as the Almighty hath been pleased to reveal himself to us is absolutely necessary for  those Persons who desire to be acquaint∣ed with the  Law of Nature  and  the Principles of Action in Man  and therefore some observations relating to the doctrine of the  Holy Trinity  are by no means foreign to the subject and in∣tention of this Tract But it is an awful mystery that must be received more by  Faith  in what God has been pleased to reveal to us than by  Human Comprehen∣sion  The  finite  understanding of the NA∣TURAL MAN    the NATURAL MAN receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know  them  because they are spiritually discerned  Cor ii  cannot in this life conceive an adequate idea of that glo∣rious and eternal BEING which in every attribute is  infinite  perfection Nay even if we had a  perfect Knowledge  of that which is now so far above us yet no language could supply words no rheto∣rical figures of comparison could be found to express that  Knowledge and it would  therefore remain unuttered  in these lower  Regions  like those  "unspeakable Words"  which were heard by the Apostle Paul when he was  "caught up into Paradise"  Cor xii For  To whom will ye liken God  said Isai xl  or what Like∣ness will ye compare unto him  But a time will come when we shall  know  even as we are  known  For  NOW  we see through a glass darkly but then  FACE  to  FACE  now  I KNOW  in part  said the Apostle to the Corinthians  but then shall I  KNOW  even as also I am  KNOWN  Cor xiii  This expression to KNOW  even as we are  KNOWN implies  a perfect Knowledge  of that eternal  Being  which is  infinite  in  Knowledge  in  Power  in  Majesty  in  Glory  cAnd therefore a more ex∣alted State of Happiness cannot be con∣ceived than that which  a perfect Know∣ledge of  GOD must affordA  Happiness  to be expected only in Heaven when  Human Nature  shall have put on  In∣corruption  and  Immortality  For this  CORRUPTIBLE Body must  put on  INCORRUPTION  and this  MORTAL must  put on  IMMORTALITY  then shall be brought to pass the Saying that is written  see Isaiah xxv  DEATH  is swal∣lowed up in  VICTORY  Cor xv  But  though we can neither attain in this life  a perfect Knowledge of God  nor that  perfect Happiness  which results from it yet it is our duty to improve and cultivate our  limited Knowledge  concern∣ing  the Divine Nature  as far as God has been pleased to reveal himself to us in the Scriptures for so FAR the  Know∣ledge  is undoubtedly  necessary  to MAN even in this life or otherwise we may be assured the  Revelation  would not have been made  in the Scriptures  by Inspiration of God  All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correc∣tion for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect c  Tim iii  who cannot act in vain Let us therefore earnestly desire to partake of that  necessary Know∣ledge  and let us look into the evidences of it with the most awful reverence  and the most humble submission of our FAITH to  the Word of  GOD lest through any improper conception of the  Divine Nature  we should unhappily fall under a similar condemnation to that of  Eli∣phaz  and his two friends who visited  Job    My Wrath  said JEHOVAH  is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me  the thing that is  right c  Job xlii  When Moses desired to see  the Glory of  JEHOVAH saying  I beseech thee shew me  THY GLORY  he was answered by the Almighty  Thou canst not see my Face for there shall no Man see me and live  Exod xxxiii  We must therefore limit our ideas of those appearances under which God re∣vealed himself to the  Patriarchs  and to  Moses  for the Gospel expressly in∣forms us that  no Man hath seen God at any time  but the Evangelist im∣mediately  adds with respect to the Mes∣siah  the only begotten Son which  IS IN THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER  he hath declared    That is  hath clearly declared  or shewn the Father or as Mr Leigh has remarked upon the Word in his  Critica Sacra  id est says he Nobis ad ejus veram cognitio∣nem eruendam Dux et Auctor fuit c  This is further explained by the de∣claration of our Lord himself  He that hath  SEEN  me  said our Lord  hath  SEEN  the Father c  John xiv  Believe me that I am in the Fa∣ther and the Father in me  And yet they are distinct persons for  the  LORD  said unto my  LORD  Sit  THOU  on  MY  right hand c  Mat xxii Psa cx

the head of the body the Church who is the be∣ginning the firstborn from the dead that in all  or among all  he might have the preeminence For it pleased  the Father  that in him should all fulness dwell  Col i  But the word  Father  expressed in this version is not found in the original Greek though it is here supplied as the  principal Substantive  which is an unjustifiable violence to the text especially as the proper  governing Substantive  of the sentence is plainly expressed in the original I mean the words  THE FULNESS for it apparently means that  Divine  FULNESS which the same Apostle in the very next chapter th verse expressly calls    "all the Fulness of the Godhead"  that DWELLETH    bodily  or  personally  in Christ so that both verses have the same application of the word  and surely  "the Fulness of the God∣head"  may with propriety be said to  will  or  please  to dwell in Christ according to the  literal sense  of the text and therefore there can be no necessity to  supply  another  Substantive  to govern the  Verb  The literal con∣struction of the text is sufficiently intelligible  which is literally  rendered by the learned  Hugh Broughton  as follows  For that in him all  FULNESS  pleased to dwell  This is copied from an old printed Bible in my Possession with MS Corrections copied from Mr Broughton's own Handwriting At the Bottom of the Page the same Verse is transcribed with a little Variation in the Order but equally literalviz  For all Fulness pleased to dwell in him    The same literal interpretation exactly has been made by the author of the  Syriac Version  which  Mons de Dieu  translates as follows  Quia in ipso voluit omnis  PLENITUDO  habi∣tare  The  Arabic Version  also has the same rendering except in one word  being construed PERFEC∣TION instead of FULNESS  Quia  PERFECTIO  omnis in eo voluit habitare  in whom all Ful∣ness dwelleth  Coloss i  for in him dwelleth all the Fulness of  the  GODHEAD BODILY    or  personally  Coloss ii  Who being the Brightness of his Glory and express Image of his    that is God's  See the first verse of the chapter which contains the governing Substantive to which this relative Pronoun  his  plainly refers  GOD  who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by  his  Son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of  his  glory and the express image of  HIS  person and upholding all things by the word of his power when

the Cities of Judah  For there  went out to him  John the Baptist JERUSALEM  and all  JUDEA  and all the Region round about Jordan  Matt iii  whom John had pre∣viously forewarned saying  After me cometh a Man  which is preferred before me  a Man whom he himself  knew not  only that "  he should be  MADE MANIFEST"    "to Israel"  John i But as soon as this faithful Messenger was divinely instructed concern∣ing the Identity of the Person that was to  be made ma∣nifest to Israel  for "GOD was MANIFEST" or  ap∣peared  IN THE FLESH Tim iii  See Note in p concerning the true Reading in

as well as the  Dignity  of the Divine Person that was  to be seen  or  made manifest to Israel  is as distinctly fore∣told in the d and th Verses of the same Chapter  The Voice of him that crieth in

FLESH SHALL SEE it TOGETHER  c This latter Sentence was fulfilled only in part when  "the Voice in the Wilderness"  pro∣claimed the Messiah saying  Behold the Lamb of God  cfor though  Jerusalem "and the Cities of Judah"  then  beheld  their GOD in the Person of  the Son of God  "  He that  SEETH ME said our Lord himself SEETH HIM THAT SENT ME" John xii Com∣pare this with John iv  because that GOD SENT  his only begotten Son into the World  c  and  saw the Glory  "  The  WORD  was  GOD"c  All  Things were made by him  c  And THE WORD  was made  FLESH  and dwelt among us and  WE BEHELD HIS GLORY the GLORY  as of the only begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth  John i  Agreeable to this the Apostle Paul informs us that  "GOD WAS MANIFEST" or  appeared    IN THE FLESH  Tim iii  The Cavils of the learned Wetstein upon this Text are clearly confuted by the very accurate Observations of the Rev Dr J C Velthusen printed at London in who proves that  C the proper Abbreviation for  and not O C or O is the true Reading in this Text  of Jehovah  that was promised to be revealed without  perceiving it  agree∣able  to another Prophecy of Isaiah  in  SEEING  ye shall  SEE  and shall not  PERCEIVE  in them is fulfilled the Prophecy of  ISAIAH  which saith By hearing ye shall hear and shall not un∣derstand and  SEEING  ye shall  SEE  and shall not  PER∣CEIVE  Matt xiii Isai vi Ezek xii    chap vi yet  all Flesh did not then  SEE  him together  Suc∣ceeding Generations indeed may be said to  see  and also to  perceive  the  Glory  of  Je∣hovah  that is with the Eye of Faith in the scriptures but the prophecy will most certainly be  literally and universally fulfilled  AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT when  ALL THE TRIBES OF THE EARTH  shall  SEE THE SON OF MAN  coming in the Clouds of Heaven with Power and  GREAT GLORY  Matt xxiv  For then "THE GLORY OF JEHOVAH"  will be so  revealed  that  ALL FLESH SHALL SEE it TOGETHER  even those Men  shall see  that now presume to deny  the Divine Nature  of our Redeemer and refuse to worship him for  BEHOLD  he cometh with the Clouds and  EVERY EYE SHALL SEE HIM  and they  also  which pierced him  Rev i  This is he  said the learned Bishop Chan∣dler speaking of the Divine WORD  In the Beginning was the  WORD  and the  WORD  was with  GOD  and the  WORD  was  GOD  The same was in the Beginning with God All things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made In him was  LIFE  and the  LIFE  was the  LIGHT  of Men And the  LIGHT  shineth in Darkness and the Darkness com∣prehendeth it not  John i c  And the  WORD  was made  FLESH  and dwelt among us and we  BEHELD HIS GLORY  the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth  John i  which was in the Beginning with God and was God and made all Things  who in time  says he  was made Flesh and is called JESUS  JESUS or Iesous from  Jeshouo in the vulgar Tongue of the Jews while our Lord was on  Earth signifying a SAVIOUR  from  SAL∣VATION  See Psal xx where the Word is used as a Noun in that Sense  "By the Strength" or in the Mighti∣nesses "of THE SALVATION of his right Hand See also Psal L  from whence is formed the Verb in Hiphal  he SAVED agreeable to the Purport of the Name JESUS declared by an Angel before the Birth of  Christ  She shall bring forth a Son and thou shalt call his Name  JESUS  for he  SHALL SAVE  his People from their Sins  Matt i  The Apostle Peter also bore the like Testimony concerning the true Meaning of Christ's Name when he was  "filled with the Holy Ghost"  in the Presence of the High Priest and Elders of the Jews saying  Ye Rulers of the People and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good Deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that BY THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH  whom ye crucified  whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole This is the stone Which was set at nought of you builders  see Psal cxviii Isai xxviii  which is become the Head of the Corner  neither is there  SALVATION  says he still alluding to  the Name  JESUS  in any other for there is  NONE OTHER NAME  under Heaven given among Men whereby we must be  SAVED  Acts iv  This Name of SALVA∣TION  therefore exactly corresponds with the Title by which the Prophet Isaiah proclaimed to the Jews the Ad∣vent of that Divine Person who was to redeem ZION  c  Say ye unto the Daughter of Zion  Behold thy  SALVATION    JESHO  cometh behold his Reward is with him and his Work before him and they shall call them The Holy People the  REDEEMED  of  JEHOVAH  c  Isai lxii  and  CHRIST as he is indeed the Foun∣tain of  Life  and  Light  to every Being  that partakes of either c  Serm before the King in p  Some∣times he is indeed treated  says the same learned Writer p  as an  Angel  or  Messenger  but even then is so distinguished from all other Angels in respect of Majesty Autority and Power or dignify'd with the incom∣municable Title of JEHOVA that they had not the least Thought of his being a meer Angel  c  The Eternal WORD though he was in  the Beginning with  GOD and was GOD yet under the Dispensation of the Gospel that he might restore the lost  Dignity of fallen Man became the  Angel  or MESSENGER of GOD that is of Jehovah Tsabaouth  the Lord of Hosts  For He was  the Messenger of the Covenant  foretold by the Prophet  Malachi  and being also  Lord of Hosts him∣self  he sent  another Messenger before his Face  to prepare  his  Way"BEHOLD I" that is I JEHOVAH TSABAOUTH  or Lord of Hosts  see the End of the Verse "  will send  MY MESSENGER" that is  John  the Baptist  Our Lord himself applied this Prophecy to  John  the Baptist  for this is  he  of whom it is written  said our Lord  "Behold I send my Messenger before thy Face which shall prepare thy Way before thee  Matt xi Mark i Luke vii    and he shall prepare the Way before me  that is  before the Divine  WORD which being included in the Unity of JEHOVAH then spoke to the Jews under the Title of LORD OF HOSTS "  and  THE LORD"  THE ADOUN  Adoun  is a Title for a great Lord and from thence one of the false Deities of the Phoenicians is  named ADONIS but when the  is prefixed to this Title in  the singular Number  it marks that the Person spoken of is not only  a hard  but THE LORD by way of Eminence as being  the  only supreme Lord and Governor of all things for it is then applicable to none but JEHO∣VAH THE LORD OF HOSTS and is so applied in no less than  seven  other Instances of Scripture without  one  In∣stance of a different Application See Exod xxiii and xxxiv Isai i iii x x xix  or supreme  Lord  "whom ye seek"  whom the Jews were taught by their Prophets to expect  shall suddenly come to  HIS  If THE ADOUN  or Lord  who was  the Messenger  of the Covenant was not also  Jehova  he could not be said to come to HIS Temple  Temple even  THE MESSENGER  or  Angel  Malach  from whence the Prophet  Ma∣lachi  himself was also named  OF THE COVENANT  whom ye delight in Behold he shall come saith the  LORD  OF HOSTS  Malachi iii  Thus it appears that  the Messenger  whom our Lord himself declared to be  John the Baptist  was to be sent to prepare the Way before JEHOVAH OF  HOSTS the same Divine Being who SPOKE by the Prophet  Behold I will send  MY  Messenger and he shall prepare the Way before  ME  But our Lord himself in referring to this Passage varies a little from the Original by making a Distinction  of Persons  between  the Lord  or  Jehovah of Hosts  who spoke and the Divine Person before whom the Messenger was to prepare the Way  Behold I send  MY  Messenger before  THY  Face  which shall prepare THY  Way before  THEE  Matt xi  This Variation from the first to the se∣cond Person from  my  to  thy  and from  me  to  thee  proves that Christ for it cannot be applied to any other but Christ and Jehovah was indeed the Person before whom the  Messenger  John was to prepare the Way and the original Text which undoubtedly is also a true Reading in this Place as it perfectly corresponds with all the ancient Ver∣sions  proves at the same time that  the Way  was to be prepared for  Jehovah  who said  Behold  I will  send  MY  Mes∣senger and he shall prepare the  Way  before  ME and consequently it appears by comparing both Texts that CHRIST is included in the Eternal Being JE∣HOVAH The Socinians endeavour to evade this Testimony of the Scripture concerning  the Divine Nature  of the Messiah by supposing that he is called  Jehovah  only in a  relative  Sense as being  the Prophet  or  Ambassador of  JEHOVAH  the Representative being named for the Prin∣cipal  In like manner for Instance say they as he that  despiseth Christ's Messen∣gers  is said to  despise Christ himself and he that despiseth him despiseth also him that sent him  Luke x  And he that lied to the Apostles lied to God  Acts v  In these and such like Passages in∣deed the  relative  Sense is manifest and  it may also in a certain degree be ad∣mitted in the Construction of the Text in question but yet not so as to favour the Socinian Argument in the least re∣spect whatsoever  The Prophecy for instance concern∣ing  the Messenger  therein mentioned of whom JEHOVAH said"  he shall pre∣pare the Way before  ME was fulfilled in the Person of John the Baptist as our Lord himself declared see Note in p and therefore according to the  Socinian  Method of Argument it might indeed be said of those worldly Men who despised that extraordinary  Mes∣senger  of  Jehovah  and neglected the Doctrine of Repentance which he en∣forced that they in so doing  despised the Lord Jehovah  by whom this Mes∣senger was sent and on the other hand those Jews who readily received John's Doctrine of Repentance and attended  diligently to his Instructions may in the like relative Sense be said to  honour Jehovah  by paying due Respect to his Messenger But a mere  relative Honour  such as might lawfully be given to the  Messenger of Jehovah  will bear no Com∣parison with  the Honour  that is due to  Jehovah  himselfthe latter must be supream  Honour and Worship  whereas the former amounts only to  Respect At∣tention  and  good Offices  for whatever is more than these must lead to Idolatry so that the Comparison can be carried no farther  A Messenger of  Jehovah  cannot there∣fore merely as such be allowed  the Name of  JEHOVAH because this would entitle him also to  the Honour  that is due to JEHOVAH alone so that when Jeho∣vah said  MY  Messenger    he  shall prepare the  Way  BEFORE ME  he must mean if Language has any Use  that the  Messenger  was to prepare the Way for the Advent of  Jehovah  himself who could not be said to come in the Person of any  Messenger  or Ambassador whatsoever except in one of the Divine Persons that are manifestly included in the same Eternal BEING and conse∣quently are entitled to the  Honour  and  Worship  as well as to the  Name  of JE∣HOVAH This glorious Title JEHOVAH is no where in Scripture attributed to any Person whatever that is not thus included in the Unity of the Godhead neither can it be without Blasphemy so that the Socinian Argument must fall to the Ground because it is the distin∣guishing Title of the supreme Divine Nature  Thou whose Name alone  is JEHOVA art the most High over all the Earth  Psal lxxxiii  or it should rather be rendered as we find it in the old English Versions  Thou whose  Name is  JEHOVAH  art  ONLY or alone  the most High  c  This Division of the Sentence is agree∣able to all the ancient Versions except the Syriac but in either way of tran∣slating the Name of JEHOVAH is ma∣nifestly given as  the distinguishing Title of the supreme  GOD and cannot therefore be attributed to any Person whatever that is not  truly God  because the said Distinction would be destroyed if the Name was ever used merely in that rela∣tive Sense for which the Socinians con∣tend Proper Names indeed were fre∣quently formed or compounded with that Holy Name by having it prefixed or postfixed to some other Word ap∣parently with an Intention to distinguish  the Servants of  JEHOVAH  See my Remarks concerning the Names  Jehoiakim Jehoiachin  and  Zedekiah  in my Tract on  the Law of Retribution  p  Note  and  but the  peculiar and incommunicable Name itself has never been mentioned by any of the Sacred Writers in such a manner as to refer us either in direct Terms or by necessary Implication to any other Persons whatsoever besides those of the Holy Trinity and on the other hand with respect to Christ it is not only  the Name  of JEHOVAH that is re∣ferred to him by the necessary Inter∣pretation of several incontestable Pas∣sages of Scripture but also the  Power  And Jesus came and spake unto them  his Dis∣ciples  saying  ALL POWER  is given unto me in Heaven and in EarthGo ye therefore and teach all Nations baptizing them in the  NAME  of the  FATHER  and of the  SON  and of the  HOLY GHOST  Matt xxviii  For as the Father raiseth up the Dead and quickeneth  them  even so the  SON  quickeneth whom he will  John v  the  Honour  For the  FATHER  judgeth no Man but hath com∣mitted  ALL JUDGMENT  unto the  SON  that all  Men  should  HONOUR  the  SON  even as they  HONOUR  the  FATHER  He that  HONOURETH  not the  SON HO∣NOURETH  not the  FATHER  which hath sent him  John v ▪  and the  Glory  of  Jehovah  And now O Father  said our Lord Jesus  GLORIFY  thou me with thine ownself  and surely to be GLORIFIED with the  Father himself  is the same Thing as to partake of the GLORY OF JEHOVAH  with the  GLORY  which I had  WITH THEE  before the World was  John xvii  so that the Socinian Evasion beforementioned is as vain as it is wicked whenever it is applied to those Passages of Scripture wherein the Name of  Jehovah  is attributed to that Divine Person  in whom dwelleth all the Fullness of the Godhead bodily  Coloss ii  JEHOVAH is the proper and  es∣sential  Name of ALMIGHTY GOD be∣cause it in some degree expresses his Eternal  Being  or  Existence  being a com∣pound Word including different Tenses or Times of the Hebrew Verb  TO BE or rather as it is the Preterperfect Tense signifying HE WAS from whence is formed  the Participle as well as  Present Tense signifying according to Buxtorf's Concordance though in his Lexicon he renders it also FUIT  ens es est  being thou art he is  to which the prefixed  the true characteristic Let∣ter of the Future Tense  shall  or  will be  is also added to form the Word  JE∣HOVAH so that this mysterious and awful Name seems to express ALL TIME or ETERNITY as if for in∣stance a Word was to be compounded of three different Tenses of the Latin Word  esse to be  viz  est fuit erit he ishe washe shall be  yet so as to include the Sense of all three and con∣sequently to denominate in one single Word an  Eternal  BEING that  ever did  and  ever will  EXISTAnd such seems to be the Interpretation of the glorious Name JEHOVAH according to the Opi∣nion of the most learned in the Hebrew Tongue viz "ENS EXISTENS AB ETERNO ET IN ETERNUM" A BEING  existing from all Eternity and for ever  This is the Sense which the learned Buxtorf has quoted in his Hebrew Lexi∣con from the famous Jewish Rabbin  Aben Ezra  and he cites also the Au∣thority of several others of the most eminent Jews much to the same Pur∣pose  Amongst the rest he cites a Commentary on some of the Psalms viz x and cxlvi c from a Jewish book wherein this sense is plainly laid down  Textus hïs docet de  DEO CREATORE  quòd est  PRIMUS  sine Principio et  ULTIMUS  sine Fine  Sic Nomen ejus  testatur de tribus existens  is seu existendi differentiis ejus  PRAESENTI PRAETERITO  et  FUTURO  quae sunt li∣terae ipseu smet Nominis appropriati  et profort tr  s  EXISTENTIAS EJUS  Voce Regui et Do∣minii ad indicandum quòd ipse regnat et gubernat in Mundo fuo secut Rex regit serv  s fuos  The Text here teaches concerning  GOD THE CREATOR  that he is  FIRST  without Beginning and  LAST  without End  So his Name bears witness of his three  Existences  or Differences of  Existing  in the  Pre∣sent  the  Preter  or  Past  and the  Future  Tenses which are the letters of his own appropriated or peculiar name  and proclaims his  three Existences  with the Voice of Rule and Dominion to denote that he reigns and governs in his World as a King governs his Subjects  But as the Words of  Holy Scripture  are best interpreted by  Holy  Scripture  he refers us at the same time to a Text in the Revelations wherein the Apostle John addresses the Seven Churches of Asia in the NAME OF GOD which is there clearly expressed in the same Sense that the Jews as I have before remarked have attributed to the Hebrew Name JEHOVAH and seems therefore to be the true Interpretation of it"  Grace be unto you and peace from him which  IS  and which  WAS  and which  IS TO COME  Rev i In like manner the four Beasts or rather living Animals  which in the Revelations represent the  Hosts or Armies of Israel  by the Figures of those Animals which were borne on the Standards of the four principal Tribes in their En∣campments round the Tabernacle  rest not Day and Night saying "Holy Holy Holy Lord God Almighty which  WAS  and  IS  and  IS TO COME    Rev iv So also  the four and twenty Elders which sat before God on their Seats fell upon their Faces and worshipped God saying We give Thanks to thee O  LORD GOD AL∣MIGHTY  which  ART  and  WAST  and  WILT BE or ART TO COME  c  Rev xi  This Eternal BEING which has been pleased to reveal himself to us in such clear and comprehensive terms is the same Almighty JEHOVAH that is men∣tioned in Genesis xiv in the highest terms of Power and Glory  the Lord  in the original JEHOVAH  the most high God the Possessor of Hea∣ven and Earth  The same Eternal BEING or JEHOVAH is also called "JEHOVAH GOD OF ISRAEL"  in Exod xxxii Joshua vii xiii xxii Judges xi c He is also called  JEHOVAH  the  GOD OF GODS      in Joshua xxii where we find this glorious title twice expressed in the same sentence  The  LORD or JEHOVAH  God of Gods  THE LORD  God of Gods he knoweth  c And therefore as the LORD or JEHOVAH mentioned in these several texts is undoubtedly THE SU∣PREME GOD we are naturally led to attribute the same  Divine Excellence  and  supreme Dignity  to the glorious name JEHOVAH wherever it occurs in other parts of Scripture because there is but ONE JEHOVAH "  Hear O Israel      "The Lord"  or Jehovah "  our God  is ONE LORD" viz ONE JEHOVAH  and thou shalt love  JEHOVAH  with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might c  Deut vi  Thus  the Unity of God  is proved to be an indispensable article of our Faith And yet we are equally bound to acknow∣ledge that  Three Divine Persons  are  comprehended in that  One  Almighty and Eternal BEING or JEHOVAH because this glorious name is clearly applied in the Holy Scriptures even in those of the Old Testament to as many  distinct Persons  who are therefore to be esteemed  equal  or ONE with  the supreme God  as  Jehovah our God  is ONE JEHOVAH  Deut vi  For though we are bound to acknow∣ledge a manifest subordination with re∣spect to the merciful and gracious OF∣FICES of  Redemption  and  Sanctification  whereby Two of the Divine Persons are particularly distinguished in Scripture yet we are obliged at the same time to believe that the several Divine Persons are of  One and the same  Eternal and Almighty EXISTENCE with respect to that incomprehensible BEING or  Divine Nature  wherein their  Unity  consists because the contrary Doctrines of those  Men who deny that OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST and THE HOLY GHOST par∣take of the  same Divine Nature  with THE FATHER do manifestly and ne∣cessarily include the supposition of a  superior  and  inferior  order of DIVINE EX∣ISTENCE for that all the Three Persons have  Divine Existence  and  Divine Attri∣butes  cannot be denied without setting aside the whole tenour of the Holy Scriptures which EXISTENCE could not without absurdity be called  one  and  the same  but must necessarily be esteemed  several  or  separate  and  different  if the least degree of  Inequality  with respect to the  Divine Nature  be ad∣mitted and therefore  such Doctrines  are totally inconsistent with our indispensable Belief in  the Unity of God  whatsoever those mistaken people who call them∣selves  Unitarians  may think  But a due regard to these two necessary distinctions viz the  Equality  and  Unity  as there is but ONE GOD of the THREE Persons with respect to their  Divine Nature  and the revealed subordi∣nation of TWO of them with respect to the merciful and gracious OFFICES of  Redemption  and  Sanctification  whereby they are  personally  distinguished and made known to us in Scripturea due regard to these  two necessary distinctions  I say and to the proper application of the several texts by which  both  are respec∣tively proved will clearly demonstrate at least to all Men who sincerely  ask  and  seek  the knowledge of Truth as Christ has commanded that  the Doctrine of the Trinity  as received by THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND is strictly con∣sistent with the indispensable doctrine of Scripture beforementioned concern∣ing the  Unity of God  That there are  Three  distinct Persons in that  One  ETERNAL BEING or JE∣HOVAH is clearly revealed in Scripture  for each Person is occasionally mentioned under that distinguishing and peculiar Name of  the Supreme God  And first with respect to the  first  Divine Person in the Holy Trinity In the d chapter of Isaiah the Divine Person whom the Prophet represents in the th verse as speaking in the name of  Jehovah  is clearly distinguished from the MESSIAH and HOLY SPIRIT and though it may seem a needless work to produce any proofs that the Almighty Father  THE GOD  and  FATHER  of our Lord  JESUS CHRIST  Ephes i See also the th verse  The God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of Glory  Our Lord himself likewise said unto Mary Magdalene after he arose from the dead  Go to my  BRETHREN  and say unto them I ascend unto  MY FATHER  and  YOUR FATHER  and to  MY GOD  and YOUR GOD  John xx    is truly JEHOVAH which no Man will deny yet I propose to recite some parts of this chapter in order to prove the  clear distinction of  Persons  and  their Offices  as revealed even in the Old Testament  Thus saith  GOD JEHO∣VAH  he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and Spirit to them that walk therein I  JEHOVAH  have called  THEE  apparently meaning the MES∣SIAH  in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people and for a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison  and  them that sit in darkness out of the prisonhouse  I AM JEHOVAH  that  is MY NAME  and  MY GLORY WILL I NOT GIVE TO ANOTHER  c  Isai xlii  These words of JEHOVAH are manifestly addressed to the MESSIAH as a  distinct  Person in his mediatorial Office of Redeemer and  the Divine Person who thus addresses  the Messiah  is manifestly the same that speaks in the first verse of the same chapter and mentions both THE MES∣SIAH and the HOLY SPIRIT in that one sentence  as distinct  PERSONS FROM HIM∣SELF and under different and distinct characters or offices of the Christian Dis∣pensation suitable to the nature of that extraordinary prophecy concerning the future Redemption of Mankind  Be∣hold  MY SERVANT  apparently meaning the MESSIAH in his state of humiliation as SON OF MAN  whom I uphold mine Elect  in whom  my Soul delighteth I have put  MY SPIRIT  upon  HIM  Here the Three Persons are distinctly expressed  He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles He shall not cry not lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street A bruised reed shall he not break c  Isai xlii  Thus we find  the Office  of THE  MESSIAH particularly described in this chapter as well as the descent of THE HOLY SPIRIT upon HIM and this is expressly foretold by the  Lord  JEHOVAH who speaks of  himself distinctly from the other two  so that the distinction of Per∣sons is hereby clearly manifested  Secondly The glorious Name of  the supreme God  JEHOVAH is plainly attri∣buted in the th chapter of Isaiah to the Second Person  the Divine Messiah  in his  Pastoral  Office as  Shepherd of Israel  The peculiar Harbinger or Forerunner of the Messiah is described and foretold in the third verse as the Forerunner also of JEHOVAH  The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness Prepare ye the  WAY  of the  LORD    THE WAY OF JEHOVAH  make straight in the desert a  HIGHWAY  for  OUR GOD  d verse  And John the Baptist in whom alone that prophecy could be fulfilled as I have shewn more particularly in my Tract on Prophecy  Remarks on several very important Prophecies  d Edit p  declared the identity of the Divine Person whom  he preceded  in the world and whose WAY he was SENT TO PREPARE saying  He that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear He shall baptize you with the  HOLY GHOST  and with Fire  Matt iii  And afterwards when the Priests and Levites those that were sent from Jerusalem to ask him  Who art thou  questioned him saying  Why baptizest thou then if thou be not that  CHRIST  nor  ELIAS  neither that  PROPHET John  answered them say∣ing I baptize with water  BUT THERE STANDETH ONE AMONG YOU  whom ye know not  HE IT IS WHO COMING AFTER ME  is preferred before me  whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose c  John i  And  "the next day"  he bore full and express testimony to the identity of the Divine Person that  came after him  whose WAY HE PREPARED  John seeth  JESUS  coming unto him and saith  BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD  which taketh away the sin of the world  THIS  is  HE  of whom I said  AFTER ME COMETH  a  MAN  which is preferred before me  FOR HE WAS BEFORE ME  And I knew him not but that he should be  MADE MANIFEST  to  ISRAEL  therefore I am come baptizing with water And John bare record saying I saw  THE SPIRIT DESCENDING FROM HEAVEN  like a dove and  IT  abode upon  HIM  And I knew him not but  HE  that sent me to baptize with water  THE SAME  said unto me  now mark again the clear declaration of Two Divine Persons separate and distinct from the Divine Being now represented  as speaking  UPON WHOM  thou  John  shalt see  THE SPIRIT  descending and remaining on  HIM  the same is  HE  which baptizeth with  THE HOLY GHOST  And I saw  said John  and bare record that  THIS  is the  SON OF GOD  Again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and  bore the like testimony to the Divine Person WHOSE WAY he was sent TO PREPARE for  looking upon  JESUS  as he walked he saith  BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD  John i  Thus John declared himself to be  the peculiar Har∣binger  as I have said  of the  SON OF GOD so that the name of JEHOVAH whose WAY in the prophecy he is ex∣pressly said to  prepare  must necessarily be attributed to the  Messiah  to whom after∣wards this long expected  preceding Messen∣ger  did personally apply the prophecy  THE VOICE OF HIM  that crieth in the wilderness Prepare ye  THE WAY OF JEHOVAH  make straight in the de∣sart  a highway for  OUR GOD  Isai xl  And the Divine Person for whom THE WAY was to be thus  pre∣pared  is so distinctly described by his  Advent  and  Pastoral Office  in the th th and th verses of this chapter that the proper application of the glo∣rious titles therein mentioned cannot be mistaken at least by those who sin∣cerely seek after truth  O Zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain O Jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift  it  up be not afraid say unto the cities of Judah  BEHOLD YOUR GOD  To the fulfill∣ing of which in Christ the Apostle Paul as I have already shewn bears ample testimony saying  GOD  is as manifest in the flesh  c  Tim iii I have just now seen a new edition of the Greek Testament by the Rev B HAR∣WOOD▪ D D published at London in the present year wherein contrary to the general evidence of the  best Greek MSS the editor has boldly ventured to alter the common reading of this text and to insert the  mas∣culin̄e  article    This  instead of the substantive    God  Had he added an accent to the article in order to render It  neuter  viz  instead of    which  instead of  this  his NEW TEXT would have seemed rather more probable because  the article  which at present is without  a Substan∣tive  would in that case have agreed with the preceding noun substantive of the  neuter  gender  and would also have been countenanced by the  neuter  relative  quod  in the  Latin Vulgate  This remark proves also that accents in some particular cases are essential to the meaning and proper construction of the text and should not therefore be indiscriminately omitted together with such as are useless as they are in this edition But in∣deed in either way with or without the accent the expression which he has introduced into the text is en∣tirely unscriptural Even if to make the best of it we should suppose that the  accent  is to be  understood  and the article to be construed as if written  what sense can be made of it A MYSTERY  which was  MANIFEST  in the fleshreceived up into glory  A parallel reading cannot be found in Scripture  As the Editor in his Preface appeals to God con∣cerning his  Sincerity  and  Integrity  it would be uncha∣ritable to call either of these in question but we are not bound to think so favourably of his  Discretion  The zeal which he has expressed at the end of his Book for the opinions of  the Polish Brethren  who were most notorious SOCINIANS gives us too much cause to suspect not only his want of  Discretion  but also such  a want of Moderation  and  Impartiality  as must render him totally unfit to DECIDE for us in the choice of controverted readings of the Holy Scriptures and consequently the preference which he has paid to his  own Opinion  by arbitrarily taking upon himself  to alter Records  The particular  alteration  of which I complain at present has but  one single Greek manuscript  to support it and what is worse even this  single  MS is not a  credible Evidence  For it has been condemned in the  strongest  terms by the most eminent criticks and judges of ancient MSS in Europe So that Dr Harwood has been particularly unfor∣tunate to adopt this very exceptionable evidence I mean the CLA∣ROMONTAN  MS of St Paul's Epistles  together with the old CAM∣BRIDGE MS  of the Gospels and Acts  as the principal authorities to justify his presumption  in altering the Sacred Records  He tells us in p vii of his Prefacethat they  approach the nearest of any manu∣scripts now known in the world to the original text of the Sacred Records  that is he must mean in HIS OWN OPINION and  accordingly in this edition  says he  these have been most commonly followed  But the famous FATHER SIMON speaking of the  Claromontan  or  Clerment  MS together with that at  St Germains  which seems to have been only a continuation or part of the two former in a third volume says  MAGNUM ILLUM ERRATORUM  quae inveniuntur in duobus illis exemplaribus in textu Graeco  ESSE INDICIUM A LA∣TINIS ESSE SCRIPTA QUI GRAECAE LINGUAE COGNITIONEM NULLAM HABUERE  With respect to the  Cambridge  MS the learned Dr  Mill  calls it"CODICEM PESSIMI COMMATIS" and asserts that it contains many things that  are not Greek  and that the writer has  "presumed to add substract and change"  this includes all the various modes of corrupting Evidence and ALTERING RE∣CORDS  an infinite number of places  "pro arbitrio"  says he    ac∣cording  to his own caprice  The very learned GER VAN MAS∣TRICHT  Syndic of Bremen  asserts the same thing only in different words  Prolixior fui de hoc Codice  says he speaking of the Cambridge MS  quia omnes Paginas implet addit detrabit mutat pro lubitu omniumque Codicum varias lectiones superat ideoque  NON MULTUM EI TRIBUEN∣DUM  quod ex examine hoc critico affatim patet  c The same learned writer informs us that M Le Clerc esteemed it a mere paraphrase "JOH CLERICUS  in Arte Critico hunc habet  PRO PARAPHRASI" c  and that  Father Simons  and the learned  Fr Gomarus held it cheap Non magnam auctoritatem tribuunt  And in the Preface to Wetstens d Edition of the Greek Testament in mo the character of the  Cam∣bridge Clermont  and  St Germain  MSS is summed up in such terms at must oblige us to think very indifferently of Dr Harwood's CHOICE of MSS and much worse of his PRESUMPTION in daring to ALTER THE SACRED RECORDS upon such miserable evidence  A Librario Latino Scripti  says the Author of the abovemen∣tioned Preface  et ad versionem Italicam corruptam  TAM INEPTE  atque  IMPERITE DEFORMATI  atque  DEPRAVATI SUNT UT RISUM MOVEANT  qui  ILLIS  locum dignitatemque genuinorum Codi∣cum Graecorum conciliare voluerunt  Now what must we think of Dr Harwood's assertion that these MSS  approach the nearest of any MSS now in the known world to the original text of the Sacred Records  If my readers have not leisure to consult the works of the several authors which I have quoted on this occasion they may see the evi∣dence  collected in the Prolegomena to the last mentioned Edition of the Greek Testament And I hope these few hints will induce the learned among the Clergy who ought to be the Guardians of the Sacred Text to examine Dr Harwood's  New Text  with care and accuracy to point out its errors to the publick and to consider of the best means to prevent any ill effects from so dangerout an attack upon the  Sacred Records  of so much importance must at best be esteemed a dangerous presumption His indiscriminate and unjust censure of the doctrine of  Atha∣nasius  which he has been pleased to intitle  The Atha∣nasian  Impiety of Three Coequal Gods  Vol II p  is a sufficient proof of the  Intemperance of his Zeal  and the  Hastiness of his Conclusions  so that THE ADVEN∣TUROUS VARIATIONS which he has made from the com∣mon Greek Text will gain but little credit by his autho∣rity Athanasius was a steady assertor of THE UNITY OF GOD and could not therefore be guilty of so shock∣ing an "IMPIETY" as to assert the Existence  of Three Coequal Gods  And if the Doctor meant only  to reflect on the Confession of Faith which is commonly called  The Athanasian Greed  his censure is  equally unjust  for  the Unity of God  is clearly and expressly taught and declared therein neither does it contain any assertions whatever concerning the Divine Nature of the  Son  and the  Holy Ghost  which are not strictly warrantable accord∣ing to the clearest evidence of Holy Scriptureby the evidence even of incontrovertible texts So that the charge about  "Three Coequal Gods"  seems to be founded only in the  indiscriminate Zeal  of him who published that  unjust assertion  against  Athanasian  It distresses me much to speak so freely of this Gentleman's performance but the cause of  Truth  compels me insomuch that if he had even been one of my own Brothers whom I dearly love I must have done just the same The opposers of the common reading  c in the abovementioned text are so clearly confuted by the Rev Dr Veithusen as I have before remarked in p that I must request my readers if they have any doubts concerning the true reading of this passage to consult his judicious and accu∣rate remarks upon it They are published at the end of a very thin Octavo pamphlet intituled  Observations on varius Subjects  Printed for C Heydinger in the Strand  And again  For  in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily  Coloss ii  So the  Apostle John "  The  WORD  was  GOD" c  "All things were made by him"  c  And the  WORD  was made  FLESH  and dwelt among us and we  BEHELD HIS  GLORY  the  GLORY  as of the only be∣gotten of the Father full of grace and  truth  John i  See notes in p But to return to the Prophet  Behold  said he  the  LORD GOD  that is ADONI JEHOVAH or  the Lord Jehovah  WILL COME  with strong  hand  and his arm shall rule for him behold  HIS REWARD is  with him and  HIS WORK  before him  HE  shall feed his flock  LIKE A SHEPHERD  the peculiar Office of the Messiah who himself declared  I am the  GOOD SHEPHERD  The  GOOD SHEPHERD  giveth his life for his sheep  c  John x  "HE" said the Prophet  shall ga∣ther the Lambs with his arm and carry  them  in his bosom  and  shall gently lead those that are with young  Isai xl  It is surely the REWARD and WORK  of the  MESSIAH in his  Pas∣toral Office  that are here so distinctly foretold and therefore the Adjective HIS and the Personal Pronoun HIM both expressed by  in the Original  and so often repeated in these verses as also the Personal Pronouns HIM and HE must necessarily be referred by the plainest rules of grammar to the Per∣sonal Nouns THE LORD GOD or ADO∣NI JEHOVAH which immediately pre∣cede them and by which the  Holy Spirit  has marked the supreme or equal  Divi∣nity  of the  Messiah  with the Father and that he is really JEHOVAH and GOD beyond all possibility of contradiction  Before the Incarnation of the Divine  Logos  or WORD OF GOD that is be∣fore he  was  MADE FLESH  and dwelt among us  John i  God re∣vealed himself to the children of Israel not only by the name of  JEHOVAH signifying  Eternal Existence  by including the characteristical letters of the  Present Preterite  and  Future Tenses  as I have already shewn but also by the name of  Ahiah which is the same verb of  Being  or  Existence  with the sign only  of the  Future Tense  signifying I WILL BE  In the common English version this name is ren∣dered  I AM    God said unto Moses  I AM THAT I AM  and he said Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel  I AM  hath sent me unto you  Exod iii  The literal meaning however of the word  as it is in the  future  tense is I WILL BE and so indeed it was rendered in the older English versionsI have a copy printed in wherein the word is rendered  I WIL BE  And the translator has added the following re∣mark upon it  Thys traunslation  says he  foloweth the Hebrue whyche hathe  I WYLL  for that whyche is in all Latten traunslations  SUM I AM  But whyche waye soever it be taken it signifieth that God onely  HATH BENE IS  and  SHALL BE  and hath hys beynge of hymselfe and that all other thynges have theyr beynge of hym Stryve not therefore for the matter but let it be  WAS AM  or  WYL BE  al is one matter  and when the Son of God was personally  present  on earth in our HUMAN NATURE  as a Descendant of Abraham  he asserted his  preexistent  state by giving himself a similar title of  Eternal Existence  though in a diffe∣rent  Tense  for he used the  Present Tense  alone without any characteristical Letter of  the Future  I AM instead of I WILL BE as the promises respecting his own Person were accomplished by  his PRESENCE which as he himself also promised will continue to the end of the world  Lo I am with you alway  even  unto the end of the world  Matth xxviii  For where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them  Matth xviii  How the Son of God who  was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God  Mark xvi  and will con∣tinue to sit there till all enemies are subdued or put UNDER HIS FEET as the Holy Ghost declared by David saying  The Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy  FOOTSTOOL  Psa cx  How the Son of God I say whose  personal residence in heaven  is so expressly declared may yet be said to be always  present on earth  with his Church will be more easily explained when I come to speak of the Divine Na∣ture and Existence of the HOLY SPIRIT in the  Eternal Being  JEHOVAH  Before Abraham was  said our Lord  I AM    John viii  This expression if the occasion of its being made be duly con∣considered cannot be made to accord properly with its context in any other sense than as a reference to Christ's Eternal Existence and as such it ma∣nifestly corresponds with the meaning of the glorious Name JEHOVAH  The purpose of our Lord's argument was certainly to declare his  preexistent State of Glory  in answer to the Jews who said  Art thou greater than our Father Abraham which is dead c  John viii    Thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen Abraham  So that his immediate answer  Before Abraham  WAS I AM  must neces∣sarily be understood in the sense which I have mentioned  He had a little time before told the Jews who disputed with him  I pro∣ceeded forth  said he  and came from God  v  The expression in the original Greek has a much deeper meaning it is not merely  "from God"  as in the common English translation but  out of God  EK  "OUT of GOD  I  PROCEEDED FORTH" c which is much more expressive of that procession which is commonly called  the Eternal Generation of the  SON of that Divine Person who  is in  the Bosom of the Father  John i  and  whose  GOINGS FORTH have been  from of old from everlasting  Micah v  Had not these Jewish unbelievers been blinded by their own wickedness and worldly desires they would have understood by the Prophets that their Messiah though he was to be  a Descen∣dant of Abraham  according to the pro∣mises was yet to be one who had ETERNAL EXISTENCE and conse∣quently must be entitled to the in∣communicable name of  Eternal Existence  JEHOVAH for he  whose goings forth  have been  from of old from ever∣lasting  was the same of whom the Prophet Micah saith that he should come out of BETHLEHEM EPHRATAH  "to be Ruler in Israel"  viz that Ruler of whom the same Prophet foretold  that they should smite the  JUDGE OF ISRAEL  with a rod upon the cheek  Compare the first and second verses of this chapter And in the fourth verse  the name of  Jehovah  is manifestly attri∣buted to the same Divine Person  And he shall stand and feed  that is  "as a Shepherd" compare with Isaiah xl ii  in the strength of  JEHOVAH  in the Majesty of the  NAME  of  JEHOVAH  his God  Compare this also with the Prophecy of Jeremiah concerning THE BRANCH from the stock of JESSE  And this  is HIS NAME  whereby he shall be called  JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  Jer xxiii  His  Eternal Existence  and  Almighty Power  as GOD were plainly declared by the Psalmist  Thy throne O  GOD  is for ever and ever  Psa xlv  This as the Apostle Paul testifies was said of the SON  But unto the  SON  he saith  Thy throne O  GOD is FOR EVER AND EVER  a Scepter of Righteousness  is  the Scepter of thy Kingdom Thou hast loved  RIGHTE∣OUSNESS  which accords with the Name of the  Divine Branch  JEHOVAH  OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  and hated ini∣quity therefore God  even  thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows  Heb i  In the latter part of this sentence in∣deed the Prophet manifestly alludes to the  inferior Nature  THE NATURE OF MAN which this Divine Person was to assume for the  Angels  were not HIS FELLOWS but  Men  it was  Human Nature  alone that was to be exalted and restored by that peculiar union with the  Divine Nature  in Christ whereby  all Mankind  are ren∣dered FELLOWS and BRETHREN to him  that is ready to judge the quick and the dead  Petiv  and may thereby become if their own negligence and wilful abuse of God's gifts do not pre∣vent them even FELLOW HEIRS Eph iii  Heirs of God and  JOINT HEIRS  with Christ  Rom viii  who is  the Heir of all things  Heb i    For verily he took not on  him the nature  of  ANGELS  but he took on  him  of the  SEED  of Abraham  Heb ii  And accordingly the same Apostle calls him  the firstborn among many  BRE∣THREN  Rom viii  and informs us also that  it behoved him to be made like unto  his BRETHEN  that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things  pertaining  to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people  Heb ii  But the Apostle never∣theless amply proclaims  the Eternal Existence  and Divine Nature of that Person mentioned in his quotation from the th Psalm who was to be  anointed  above HIS FELLOWS for he immedi∣ately afterwards quotes another Psalm viz cii to assert the ETER∣NAL DIGNITY AND POWER of the same Person  And thou  LORD  Lord  The Apostle manifestly applies to Christ the title of  Lord  which is the usual  Greek  rendering of the  Hebrew  title JEHOVAH the  essential  name of that Eternal BEING to whom the Prophet in the ciid Psalm here quoted really addressed himself as appears by the first verse  "JEHOVAH  Hear my prayer"  c And in the th verse which immediately precedes the Apostle's quota∣tion the Person addressed by the Psalmist is expressly called upon as God  my God  I said O  MY GOD  take me not away in the midst of my days thy years  are  throughout all generations  and then im∣mediately follows the Apostle's quotation  Of old thou laid the foundation of the earth  c To which he has added the word  though not expressed in the original so that he must mean thereby to express the Person to whom the Psalm in general was addressed viz  the Lord  or JEHOVAH There is something pe∣culiarly deep and mysterious in this  Psalm  The Prophet in his own person as a man of afflictions seems to express and prefigure the temporal sufferings humiliation and death  See particularly the d and th verses  He weakened my strength in the way  probably alluding to the failure of our Lord's bodily strength  "in the way"  to Mount Calvary when he was  led away bearing bis cross  before the soldiers compelled Simon of Cyrene to carry the cross Compare John xix with Matt xxvii  he shortened my days I said O my God take me not away in the midst of my days thy years  are  throughout all generations  The Hebrew word here rendered  "to take away"  is formed from the root  to  ascend  and from the ASCENDING of smoke  towards heaven  the same word signifies also to  offer a burntoffering  and as a substantive it signifies  a burntoffering  or  sacrifice  for it is thus used both as a  substantive  and as a  verb  in that remarkable command of God to  Abraham  by which THE SACRIFICE OF THE SON OF GOD was manifestly prefigured  Take now  THY SON  said God to Abraham  THINE ONLY Son ISAAC  whom thou lovest and get thee into  THE LAND OF MORIAH  and  OFFER HIM  there for  A BURNTOFFERING    upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of  Gen xxii  It was also  "upon one of the mountains"  in "THE LAND OF MORIAH" that the  "Beloved Son of God"  who is also eminently called  Son of Man  by having voluntary taken upon himself the  Seed of Abraham  in which according to the promise in Gen xxii  all the nations of the earth were to be blessed  was really sacrificed and became  "the propitiation for our sins"  John ii  as even Caiaphas the wicked High Priest himself had foretold saying  It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not  John xi  He was accordingly  brought as  A LAMB  to the slaughter  which Isaiah had long before declared Isai liii nay Abraham himself seemed to have foretold this long before the giving of the Law from Mount Sinai at a time indeed when he thought of another sacrifice even when he led his own  Beloved Son  as the victim BEARING THE WOOD for the sacrifice just as the  Beloved Son  of God was afterwards  led away  to death BEARING HIS CROSS John xix For Isaac said to Abraham  Behold the fire and the wood but where is  THE LAMB FOR A BURNTOFFERING  "And abraham said My Son  GOD  will provide himself  A LAMB  for a Burntoffering  Gen xxii  And accordingly we find the Harbinger of the Messiah proclaiming the manifestation of that promised Lamb  BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD  which taketh away the sin of the world  John i  for Isaiah had also foretold this propitiation saying  He was  wounded for our transgressions  he was  bruised for our iniquities  Isai liii  In like manner the inspired Psalmist in the particular Psalm already mentioned seems to allude also to the same great  sacrifice  of  the Son of God  if the interpretation of the word  which it necessarily bears in the abovecited command of GOD to Abraham and many other places be admitted  He weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days I said O my  GOD    SACRIFICE ME NOT  in the midst of my days  Psa cii  So Christ afterwards in reality prayed to God that the bitter cup of his sufferings might pass from him  O  MY FA∣THER  said he  if it be possible let this cup pass from me never∣theless not as I will but as that wilt  Matt xxvi  for being  in all points tempted like as  we are yet  without sin  Heb iv  he was affected through the weakness of that  Human Nature  which he had taken upon him with all the horrors of an approaching agonizing death but as he knew that  all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and  in  the Prophets and  in  the Psalms concerning himself  Luke xxiv  he soon afterwards declared his steady resolution to suffer for us saying  The cup which my Father hath given me shall I not drink it  John xviii  And accordingly he was  taken away  or rather  sacrificed    IN THE MIDST OF HIS DAYS  agreeable to the expression above cited from the Psalmist being in the  thirtyfifth  year of his age as Scaliger and several other learned men have supposed see the Rev Mr Bur∣ton's Essay towards reconciling the Numbers of Daniel and John p which is exactly  half  the age of MAN I mean  half  the term which Moses in the th Psalm has declared to be the usual period of  Human  Life But even if our Lord was only in the thirtythird year of his age when he suffered according to the common chronology he might still with sufficient propriety be said agree∣able to the Psalmist's expression to be SACRIFICED IN THE MIDST OF HIS DAYS  of the MESSIAH as A MAN upon earth at the same time that he prays to him as GOD and JEHOVAH that  looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven  c See verse  in the beginning has laid the foundation  of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish  but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a  vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail  Heb i  So that our Lord  was really in his  Being  or  Existence  what the same Apostle seems to apply to his  Doctrine  JESUS CHRIST  the same yesterday and today and for ever  Heb xiii  For it was He who said  Fear not  I AM THE FIRST AND THE LAST I am  He that liveth and was dead and be∣hold I am alive for evermore Amen and have the keys of hell and death  Rev i  Thus it appears that our Redeemer was not only JEHOVAH in  Name  but in  Effect  or  Reality  also if the true meaning of that title be con∣sidered as his being THE FIRST and THE LAST demonstrates his Eternal  Existence  and  Power  as much as the Name of JEHOVAHCompare the lastmentioned text with the exhortation of GOD by Isaiah xli to his people Israel  FEAR THOU NOT  for I  am  with thee be not dismayed  FOR  I  am THY GOD  I will strengthen  thee yea I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my  RIGHTEOUSNESS  And again in the th and th verses  For I the  LORD or JEHOVAH  thy  GOD  will hold thy right hand saying unto thee  FEAR NOT  I will help thee  FEAR NOT  thou worm Jacob  and  ye men of Israel I will help thee saith  THE LORD  i e JEHOVAH  and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel  And this LORD or JEHOVAH who here declares himself to be THE GOD  of Israel  proclaims his own ETERNAL EXISTENCE near the beginning of the same chapter viz th verse  in the very same terms  that were used in the Reve∣lations by him  THAT LIVETH AND WAS DEAD    Who hath wrought and done  it  said JEHOVAH by Isaiah  calling the generations from the beginning I the Lord  JEHO∣VAH THE FIRST  and  WITH THE  LAST  I  am HE  And also in the th chapter ver  Thus saith the  LORD JEHOVAH  the King of Israel and his Redeemer the  LORD OF HOSTS JEHOVAH TSABAOUTH I am THE FIRST  and  I am THE LAST  and beside me  there is  no God  See also Isai xlviii where∣in we find that  the God of Israel the Lord of Hosts  mentioned in the d verse declares his  Eternal Existence  in the very same terms used by  Christ  in the Revelation viz  I am THE FIRST I ALSO am THE LAST  and as it has already been shewn that the true meaning of the title JEHOVAH is nearly to the same purpose it is ma∣nifest that  Christ  is JEHOVAH in  effect  as well as in  name  He is JEHOVAH also in  power  and  glory    Who have declared this from the ancient time  said Isaiah  Who  hath told it from that time  Have  not  I JEHOVAH  and  there is NO GOD ELSE BESIDE ME A JUST GOD  and  A SAVIOUR there is  none beside me Look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for I  am GOD  and  there is  none else I have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth  in  righteous∣ness and shall not return  THAT UNTO ME EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW EVERY TONGUE SHALL SWEAR  Isai xlv  Now let us see to whom this is ap∣plied by the Apostle Paul  For none of us  that is no true Christian  liveth to himself  says the Apostle  and no man dieth to himself For whe∣ther we live we live unto  THE LORD  and whether we die we die unto  THE LORD  whether we live therefore or die  WE ARE THE LORD'S  For to  this end Christ both died and rose and revived that he might  BE LORD  both of the dead and living But why dost thou  JUDGE  thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the  JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST  For it is writ∣ten  Here the Apostle applies to  Christ  the very text which I last cited from Isaiah  as I live saith  THE LORD  It was JEHOVAH who spake by Isaiah in the text cited by the Apostle  Unto  ME  every knee shall bow  c for  Jehovah  proclaimed his title in the preceding context which I quoted above  I JEHOVAH  and  there is  "no God else beside me"  c and therefore it is certain that the Apostle here uses the word  or LORD as the usual Greek rendering for JEHOVAH for so it is generally translated in the Greek versions of the Old Testament as well as in the Gospels so that by applying the title  or LORD in this place to Christ he manifestly applies to him the title of JEHOVAH to which it refers in the Hebrew    EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL CONFESS TO GOD  So then every one of us shall give account of himself  TO GOD  Let us not therefore  JUDGE  one another any more c  Rom xiv  The reason here as∣signed by the Apostle for the illegality of JUDGING our  Brother  is that  we shall all stand at the  JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST  to whom he attributes the dignity of JEHOVAH by maintain∣ing in the preceding context that he is THE LORD to whom we  live  and  die  c and by applying to him Isaiah's prediction of universal homage to JE∣HOVAH as if Christ himself in his preexistent state had said  I JEHOVAH c  Unto me every knee shall bow  cAnd from this ap∣plication of the Prophecy to the Person of Christ the Apostle immediately draws a conclusion with a manifest re∣ference to what he had before said of  our standing at the Judgment Seat of Christ    So then every one of us shall give account of himself to  GOD  Let us not therefore  JUDGE  one another any more  c  From this whole quotation it ap∣pears that when the Apostle asserts the dignity of Christ as being THE LORD of us all  that we live and die "UNTO THE LORD"  c he in effect applies to him the dignity of JEHOVAH as that title is usually ex∣pressed in Greek by  THE LORD In the Septuagint tranflation we read    Hear O Israel the Lord our God is one Lord  for  that is  Hear O Israel  JEHOVAH  our God is  ONE JEHOVAH  Deut vi  And the same text is expressed exactly in the same words by the Evan∣gelist Mark xii where he recites our Lord's answer to the question of the Scribe about the first or chief  Commandment  for the Evangelist un∣questionably substitutes the word  Lord in his Greek text for  Je∣hovah in the original Hebrew of which there are many more instances in  the New Testament so that from thence we are taught the true import and meaning of the title    the Lord  as applied to Christ in the New Testament  LORDS there are indeed many and the word  is of as general use and application in the  Greek Tongue  per∣haps as SIR in the  English Tongue  but yet whenever it is preceded by the article  as  and has no express reference to any particular place title office or  temporal  dignity it must ne∣cessarily in that case be understood as a title of  Supreme Dignity  because it is then applicable to no other Being but that alone which is most eminently  the Lord    as being "  Lord of all  This title of  supreme Dignity  is due not only to THE HEAVENLY FATHER but is also expressly applied to his MESSIAH  The word which  God  sent unto the chil∣dren of Israel preaching Peace by  JESUS CHRIST  he is  LORD OF ALL  Acts x  " so that the title  THE LORD and  many times  even without the ar∣ticle is with propriety substituted in the Greek Scriptures  When the Apostle Matthew cites Isaiah's pro∣phecy that  "a Virgin shall be with child"  and applies it to the birth of  Jesus  by the Virgin Mary a descendant of the house of David he says  Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of  THE LORD    by the Prophet c  Matt i  whereas in the Book of the Prophet himself we find that the prediction was the Word of  Jehovah  See Isai vii  Moreover the Lord  ie JEHOVAH  spake again unto Ahaz saying Ask thee a signof  JEHOVAH  thy God  c  Again when Isaiah's Prophecy concerning the Har∣binger of Christ"  Prepare ye the way of  JEHOVAH" c Isai xl is cited in the New Testament we find the Greek word    Lord  substituted for the Hebrew name JEHOVAH by all the Four Evangelists Matt iii Mark i Luke iii and John i This Prophecy by the unanimous testimony of all these Evangelists is applied to the  Preaching of John the Baptist  who himself pointed to JESUS as the Person whom he was sent to  precede  in the world and for whom he prepared  the way  BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD  saith the Baptist  which taketh away  or beareth  the sin of the world  THIS IS HE  of whom I said  AFTER ME COMETH  a Man which is preferred before me  c  John i  Jesus therefore is undoubtedly that  that  Lord  or  Jehovah  before whom John prepared the way agreeable to the prediction of the Prophet as I have elsewhere remarked  "  Ye shall not tempt  JEHOVAH  your God"  c in Deut vi is rendered by Matthew iv and also by Luke iv  Thou shalt not tempt  THE LORD  thy God    and the like rendering of the title JEHOVAH may be found in the th verse of the same chapter of Matthew and in the th verse of the same chapter of Luke  Also  thou shalt keep and perform a freewill offering according as thou hast vowed unto  JEHOVAH  thy God c  in Deut xxiii  is rendered by the Apostle Mat∣thew v  Thoushalt perform  UNTO THE LORD    thine oaths  Deut vi  Thou shalt love  JEHOVAH THY GOD  with all thine heart  is rendered by Matthew xxii by Mark xii and by Luke x  Thou shalt love  THE LORD THY GOD      Also    JEHOVAH  said unto my Lord  in the th Psalm ver is rendered by the  Apostle Matthew xxii  THE LORD  said unto my Lord  c and in the same  manner exactly by Mark xii and by Luke xx and also in the Acts ii  In the remarkable Prophecy of Isaiah lxi quoted by St Luke iv concerning the Preaching of the MESSIAH or ANOINTED    The Spirit of  ADONI JEHOVAH or  the Lord  JEHOVAH  is upon me because  JEHOVAH  hath  ANOINTED  me to preach to the poor  c The Evangelist has substituted the Greek title  for the Hebrew titles Adoni Jehovah  The Prophecy in the th Psalm ver which was cited by our Lord himself  "  Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of  JEHOVAH" is rendered by the Evangelist Luke xiii  Blessed is he that cometh  IN THE NAME OF THE LORD    And he expresses the Name  Jehovah  by the same Greek title  when he afterwards records the circum∣stance whereby that Prophecy was in part fulfilled viz the publick entry of Christ into Jerusalem when the  whole multitude of disciples  proclaimed before him saying "  Blessed is the King that cometh  IN THE NAME OF THE LORD"  Luke xix See also John xii where we find the same rendering of the words  in the Name of  JEHOVAH  by  in the Name of  THE LORD      The Prophecy of Isai liii  Who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of  JEHOVAH  revealed  is rendered by the Evangelist John  Lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm  OF THE LORD    been revealed  John xii  These examples from the Evangelists I hope are amply suffi∣cient to prove the true meaning and importance of the Greek title    Lord  when it is applied to  God  or to  Christ  in which case it implies nothing less than the dignity of  Jehovah  for the title JEHOVAH in translations and quota∣tions  from the Hebrew original wherein that Holy Name occurs  It would take up too much of my reader's time as well as of my own  were I to cite all the examples that may be found in the Greek Scriptures of quo∣tations from the Hebrew text wherein the word  or Lord is substituted  for the Hebrew title  Jehovah however I have inserted in the pre∣ceding note a sufficient number I hope of examples from the Evangelists to demonstrate beyond contradiction the true meaning and importance of the Greek title  LORD when it is applied to GOD or to CHRIST for in that case if there is any truth in the Evangelists as faithful translators it implies and expresses nothing less than the dignity of JEHOVAH Exactly in this sense therefore we must necessarily understand the Apostle Paul when he tells us in his first Epistle to the Co∣rinthians xv  that the first Man  is  of the earth earthy the second Man  is    THE LORD or JEHOVAH  from heaven  The effect of this translation of mine will appear sufficiently justifiable if it is compared with a parallel expression of  John the Baptist  recorded by  John the Evangelist  iii  He that cometh from above  IS ABOVE ALL      he that is of the earth is earth∣ly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven  the Apostle re∣peats his assertion  IS ABOVE ALL  This is clearly a part of the testimony of  John the Baptist  concerning the  supreme Dignity  of that Divine Person whose WAY he was sent TO PREPARE  John the Baptist as I have already remarked was sent  to prepare the way of  JEHOVAH  his voice  was the long expected  voice  foretold by Isaiah  The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of  JEHOVAH  xl  He was that extraordinary  Mes∣senger of  JEHOVAH foretold by Malachi iii  Behold I will send  MY  Messenger and he shall prepare the way before  ME  c that is  I  JEHOVAH  will send my Messenger and he shall prepare  the way before  ME  viz  before  JEHOVAH for the Divine Person whom the Prophet represents as speaking these words is expressly mentioned in the th verse of the same chapter  For I  am JEHOVAH  I change not  c It therefore evidently appears that  the way was to be prepared for  JEHOVAH and indeed the prediction was fulfilled in the most exact literal sense for when this extraor∣dinary Messenger was questioned by his own disciples and the Jews concerning JESUS saying  he that was with thee beyond Jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him  John shewed them that their report of the in∣creasing power and fame of Christ contained nothing contradictory to the testimony which he had always borne concerning his own office and calling  Ye yourselves  said he  bear me witness that I said I am not  THE CHRIST  but that I am sent before him  that is before the Christ or Messiah And after assuring them that Christ must increase saying  "he must increase but I  must  decrease"  he added the highest testimony that could be given of Christ's heavenly Power and Divine Existence such a testimony as became that extra∣ordinary Messenger who was sent  to prepare the way of Jehovah  saying "  he that cometh from above  IS ABOVE ALL" which ex∣pression cannot with propriety be applied to any person that is not really and truly  Jehovah  John iii  For the sentence immediately follows what the Baptist said of Christ  "He must increase but I  must  decrease"  John iii  c  Now it must be allowed that none except  the God of Israel whose name alone is  JEHOVAH  Psa lxxxiii  can justly be said to be ABOVE ALL So that if THE MESSIAH was not truly GOD and included with the  Al∣mighty Father  and  the Holy Ghost  in the Eternal BEING JEHOVAH this expres∣sion that he "IS ABOVE ALL" could not with the least propriety be so pe∣remptorily  and repeatedly applied to him But as  John the Baptist  who was sent to  prepare the way of  JEHOVAH as I have already remarked has positively asserted concerning him that  cometh from heaven  that he  "is above all"  we must necessarily conclude that  the LORD FROM HEAVEN  the title applied to Christ by the Apostle Paul in the parallel text recited above is a title of  supreme Dignity  and implies as much as if the Apostle had expressly intituled the Messiah"JEHOVAH  from heaven"  for had this latter been literally ex∣pressed by some Prophet in the Hebrew tongue the Apostle's words  would have been the regular Greek version of such an expression which I have already proved by a variety of examples See pages  But Christ is not only  THE LORD or JEHOVAH  from heaven  but he is also  "the Lord of Glory"  Which none of the princes of this world knew  for had they known  it  they would not have crucified    THE LORD OF GLORY  Cor ii  one of the highest titles that can be conceived So that if he were not really of one and the same  Divine Nature  with the  Almighty Father  this title of  Su∣preme Excellence  THE LORD OF GLORY  could not be used with the least degree of propriety especially as God i e the LORD  Jehovah  has declared to the Jews  that he will not give his Glory to another  viz  I am  THE LORD i e JEHOVAH  that is  MY NAME  and  MY GLORY  will I not give to another c  Isai xlii  If Christ therefore is  the  LORD OF GLORY  he must necessarily be esteemed ONE  with the Father  in the Eternal BEING JEHOVAHOur Lord himself also declared  I and the Father are  ONE      John x and yet this very sentence which asserts THE UNITY of the Father and the Son expresses at the same time a manifest  Distinction of Persons  which is also clearly demonstrable in almost every other page of Scripture though the doctrine of the  Unity  of  God  is not less clearly laid down and inculcated throughout the Scriptures  Our Lord has delivered this doctrine of his  Unity with the Father  in various modes of expression as  He that hath seen me  said he  hath seen the Father  c and  I am in the Father and the Father in me c  John xiv  and yet the true nature and manner of that UNITY must still remain  a Mystery  because a perfect knowledge of that  Eternal  BEING which in every way is  infinite  cannot possibly fall within the comprehension of our  finite  understand∣ings  See page    This doctrine is nevertheless a ne∣cessary part of our Faith because the Scriptures contain such a proportion of evidence really within the measure of  Human  judgment as is sufficient to authenticate the whole and demonstrate the Divine Mission of those Holy Per∣sons by whom they were from time to time delivered for our instruction and therefore as we are answerable to God for the use or abuse of that  Know∣ledge of Good and Evil  which we inherit from our first parents as I have already shewn in the beginning of this Tract we cannot reject any part of  the Scrip∣ture Evidence  without being guilty of such a manifest perversion and abuse of that hereditary  Knowledge  as must ren∣der us highly culpable before God and endanger our eternal welfare We are bound therefore to receive even some things that we do not understand for the sake of those things which we do  understand just as our Lord himself instructed  Philip  to believe this very doctrine of his UNITY WITH THE FATHER for the sake of  the mighty Works    or else believe me  said our Lord  for the very works sake  John xiv  Our Lord had been instruct∣ing his disciples concerning his own dignity and office  I am  THE WAY  said he  and  THE TRUTH  and  THE LIFE  no man cometh unto the Father  BUT BY ME  If ye had known me ye should have known my Father also and from henceforth  YE KNOW HIM  and  HAVE SEEN HIM  Philip saith unto him  LORD  shew us  THE FATHER  and it sufficeth us  JESUS  saith unto him Have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known  ME  Philip  HE THAT HATH SEEN ME HATH SEEN THE FATHER  and how sayest thou  then  Shew us the  FATHER  Believest thou not that  I AM IN THE FATHER AND THE FATHER IN ME  The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but  THE FATHER  that dwelleth in me he doeth  THE WORKS  Believe me  THAT I AM IN THE FATHER  and  THE FATHER IN ME  or else believe me for the very  WORKS  sake  John xiv  which he had shewn him for these indeed were evident to his senses and could not be denied and therefore as the Divine Mission was so strongly authenticated  Philip  was bound to receive  the whole Doctrine  of the  Gospel as delivered by Divine Autho∣rity even though he did not compre∣hend it And in like manner is every man indeed obliged to submit his judg∣ment in receiving and acknowledging these revealed mysteries of our religion for the sake of that substantial evidence which the Scriptures afford us of other  Truth and Facts  which fall more im∣mediately within the measure of Hu∣man Comprehension  Believe me that I am in the Father  said our Lord  and the Father in me  or else BELIEVE ME FOR THE VERY WORKS SAKE  But our Lord nevertheless conde∣scended to illustrate this doctrine in some degree by  a most interesting com∣parison  which relates very materially to the principal subject of this Tract THE NATURE OF MAN because it informs us at the same time concern∣ing that  intimate Connexion with  THE  DIVINE NATURE which HUMAN NATURE is rendered capable of ac∣quiring through the Divine Mediator between GOD  and Man  Sanctify them  said that DIVINE MEDIATOR when he prayed to his "HOLY FATHER" for his Disciples  through thy Truth  THY WORD IS TRUTH    And who is this  Logos  this  Word  this  Truth of the  "HOLY FATHER" both under the  Old  and  New Covenant  but our  Divine Mediator  himself who imme∣diately added  As thou hast sent  ME said he  into the world even so have I also sent them  viz the Disciples as he had formerly sent the Prophets  into the world And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the Truth Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their Word that  THEY ALL MAY BE  ONE  which is the  interesting com∣parison  beforementioned  AS THOU FATHER art IN ME AND I IN THEE THAT THEY ALSO MAY BE ONE IN US  that the world may be∣lieve that thou hast sent me And  THE GLORY  which  THOU  gavest  ME  I have given  THEM  that  THEY MAY BE ONE EVEN AS WE ARE ONE I IN THEM AND THOU IN ME  that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent  ME  and hast loved  THEM  as thou hast loved  ME FATHER I WILL    that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold  MY GLORY  which  THOU  hast given  ME  for thou lovedst me  BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD O RIGHTEOUS FATHER  the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me  And I have declared unto them thy Name and will declare  it  that  THE LOVE  wherewith thou hast  LOVED ME  may be  IN THEM  and I in them  John xvii  Here is a glorious declaration of the  Dignity  to which God has been pleased to call MANKIND And as  the Unity  of the Disciples or true Believers is thus clearly compared to  the Unity  of THE FATHER and THE SON it is manifest that the doctrine of the lastmentioned UNITY as far as the Scriptures have revealed it to us is a topic necessarily included in the subject of this Tract  "The Nature of Man"  But this  Unity  of THE FATHER and THE SON is not in all respects  the same Unity  as that wherein the Church or Congregation of Disciples and true Be∣lievers is included with  the Father and the Son  That they also  said Christ to his Heavenly Fa∣ther  may be  ONE IN US  though the Faithful undoubt∣edly partake of  the Divine Nature  by the  HOLY SPIRIT agreeable to the promises see p and both CHRIST and THE FATHER are "IN THEM" as our LORD said  I  IN THEM  and  THOU  in me  agreeable to what our Lord had once before declared  If a man love me he will keep my words and  MY FATHER  will love him and  WE  will  COME UNTO HIM  and make  OUR ABODE  with him  John xiv  Thus HUMAN NATURE is capable of being  exalted  and  dignified  even in this life notwithstanding the uncertainties and sufferings attending our worldly con∣dition  The Faithful indeed are ONE  in the Father and the Son  as our Lord prayed for them to his Heavenly Father  that they all may be  ONE      AS  thou  FATHER art  in me and I in thee that they also may be  ONE IN US  c and again that  they may be  ONE    EVEN AS  WE ARE ONE  I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in  ONE  c but we must be careful to maintain the due distinction between  the Unity  of THE FATHER and THE SON and  the Unity  of the Faithful  in the Father and the Son  The latter is indeed in some respect or other  like  the former  alike  probably in that very circumstance alone of being in  Unity  in  Unity  of WILL of LOVE and UNI∣VERSAL  Benevolence  c for  GOD IS LOVE  and he that dwelleth  IN LOVE  dwelleth  IN GOD AND GOD IN HIM c  John iv  but it is not altogether the  same Unity  wherein the Scriptures declare  the Almighty Fa∣ther  and his Son to be ONE as some  Socinians  have conceived or it could not with propriety be compared with it  Like  is compared with  Like  but  Like is not the same  even to a proverb In what respect the latter  Unity  may be  like  the former I have already shewn by authority  of Scripture but THE HEAVENLY FATHER and HIS SON are ONE in many other respects which cannot with the least degree of propriety be attri∣buted to the Unity of the Church in Christ The Son of God is ONE with his Almighty Father in  Eternal Existence  in that BEING of Eternity JEHOVAH See p c They are ONE also  in Power  and Divine Attributes The Son being expressly intitled  LORD OF ALL  See page  THE LORD FROM HEAVEN  page  THE LORD OF GLORY  p  and is also declared to be  ABOVE ALL  p  and  OVER ALL GOD  says St Paul speaking of the people of Israel    Whose  or of whom are  the Fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh  CHRIST came WHO IS OVER ALL GOD  blessed for ever  Amen  Rom ix  BLESSED FOR EVER  And our Lord manifested himself to be truly GOD when he asserted his  "Power on earth to forgive sins"  without contradicting the inward sentiment of the Scribes  "reasoning in their hearts"    Who can forgive sins but  GOD  only  See Mark ii    These  are undoubtedly Attributes of the Hea∣venly Father and many more shall hereafter be mentioned in the course of the argument so that THE FATHER and THE SON are manifestly ONE in these several respects and in many more as there is but ONE GOD or ONE JEHOVAH But  the Unity  of the Congregation of true Believers that they are ONE in  Christ  c must be considered in a more confined sense the true Believers are ONE glo∣rious Universal Church ONE Building of which our Lord JESUS CHRIST is  the Foundation  Cor iii  the chief Corner Stone  Eph ii  "they are a Spiritual House"  Pet ii  a Bride  For thy Maker is thine  HUSBAND  the Lord  Je∣hovah  of Hosts  is  his Name and thy  REDEEMER  the Holy One of Israel the God of the whole earth shall he be called  Isai liv    John iii  a Being of  many  in  one  So we  being MANY  are  ONE BODY  in Christ and every one members one of another  Rom xii  as the symbol of the Che∣rubim  four  living Creatures in  one  which moved with  one Spirit  and repre∣sented  the Hosts of Israel  see p  and of course all those that are engrafted on that stock the Olivetree of Israel through Christ  For  if ye be  CHRIST'S  then are ye  ABRAHAM'S SEED  and heirs according to the promise  Gal iii  Thus all true believers in Christ by being accounted  "Abraham's Seed"  are included in the  Spiritual Israel  and are esteemed ONE in Christ that is ONE  Catholick Church  but not ONE  Jehovah  for in the peculiar  Unity  of the latter none can be included except the Three Divine Persons to whom alone the supreme Title JE∣HOVAH is distinctly attributed in the Scriptures  My reason for making this remark is that some learned Men in their Comments on Jeremiah xxxiii viz Grotius Vitringa and several others have applied to  Jerusalem  that glorious Title which the Scriptures have given to Christ alone viz "JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTE∣OUSNESS The learned and Rev Mr William Lowth formerly Prebendary of Winchester in his Commentary on Jeremiah p also applies it to  JERUSALEM  that is  says he  to the  CHURCH  c The learned  Authors of our last excellent English Version have like∣wise unhappily fallen into the same error though the older English Versions were clear from it and have ren∣dered the passage as follows  And this  is the name  wherewith  SHE  shall be called  THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  So Vitringa  Hoc est  No∣men  quo  IPSA  denominabitur  JEHOVA JUSTITIA NOSTRA  Anacrisis Apocalypsios p  But the Hebrew Text will bear no such construction insomuch that the abovementioned Translators have been obliged to  interpolate  their respective Versions of this passage with words that have  nothing to answer them in the original  in order to make up that imaginary sense of it which they have erroneously adopted for they supply the words  "is the name"  and "NOMEN" for which there is not the least authority in the original Text Supplementary words are never allowable in translations from the Hebrew Scriptures unless they are absolutely  necessary  to render the sense compleat by filling up such a vacuum in the English Expression as sometimes arises from the difference of idiom in the two Languages but they are very far from being  necessary  in the Text before us which will appear by two plain Circumstances vizst That  a literal rendering  of the Hebrew in this Text into English affords  an intelligible and just construction  without that  interpolation  so that  here can be no reason or authority whatever for making  itAnd dly That the Words supplied by the Translators have led them for they could not have so rendered the Hebrew Text without them to attribute to  Jerusalem  that glorious Title which in the Parallel Passage of Jeremiah Ch xxiii as well as in the Text before us apparently belongs to the  Righteous  Branch of David  the King  that should reign and execute Judgement and  Righteousness    in the earth so that the passage instead of being as in the Hebrew Bible  parallel  to the former  In the former passage Jer xxiii the RIGHTEOUS  Branch  of the House of David  the King  that was to  reign  and  do judgement  and RIGHTEOUSNESS  in the Land  is manifestly called "JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS"  "In  HIS  days"    here is a  masculine  relative plainly refering back to the substantive    King  in the preceding sentence  "Judah shall be saved"    femininei e Judah  she  shall be saved  and Israel shall dwell safely  these are mentioned as  contingents  of that  King's Reign  so that the  principal Substantive  must be known by the reference of the  Relative  which plainly points to  the  King  mentioned in the preceding sentence  And this  is HIS  name whereby he shall be called    Here the  Masculine Relative  is again inserted and connected by the copulative  and  to the  Relative  in the beginning of the same sentence so that  both relatives  manifestly refer back to  the same principal Substantive  the King  mentioned in the preceding sentence and not to the nearest substantives  Judah  and  Israel  as some have erroneously con∣ceived in order to make the Text correspond with the  mistaken  con∣struction of the Parallel Text which cannot be done without vio∣lence  to  both  Texts and therefore we must abide by  the Letter  and construe this part of the Sentence as follows  And this  is HIS  Name which  THEY  shall call  or "proclaim" rather than  "whereby he shall be called"  for the Verb is in the d person plu∣ral "THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS"The expression in the other  parallel Text  varies in several circumstances from this so that Critics cannot be justified in attempting to warp the sense of this passage to that nor the sense of that to this but on the con∣trary are bound to give to each of them their  true literal  Sense and we shall find that  the parallel  will be so far from being weakened thereby that it will on the contrary appear much more clear and consistent  is rendered by their  Translation absolutely  dissonant irreconcileable  and  un∣parallel  not only to that particular Text but to every other part of Scripture  Jerusalem  or  the Church  might be allowed by way of Title to bear a Motto or Memorial respecting  the Righteousness of Jehovah  or that  Jehovah is Righteous  as King ZEDEKIAH and others certainly did hear such a memorial of JEHOVAH in their names see my Tract on  the Law of Retribution  p but neither  Zedekiah  nor even the  Redeemed Church  or  Spiritual Jerusalem  could with the least degree of pro∣priety be called what Christ alone really was and is  "Jehovah  OUR  Righteousness"  But the impropriety of thus applying that glorious Title need not be argued it is amply sufficient to shew that the Hebrew Text cannot admit of such a construc∣tion  without doing violence to it as Vitringa and the learned English Translators have done by supplying the Word  Nomen or name which is not found in the Text See the words at length  That is  In those days  referring back to the former Sentence wherein THE RIGHTEOUS BRANCH of David is foretold and that he shall execute Judgement and RIGHTEOUSNESS in the Land  shall Judah be saved    feminine  She  shall be saved  and Jerusalem shall dwell    also feminine  she  shall dwell  safely  AND HE    Iste  or  this person    WHO SHALL CALL HER  or rather"he who shall call  to  HER"    is  THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  Here is a Translation strictly  literal  the only word supplied being the common auxiliary verb  is  which very frequently is found ne∣cessary to be added to the English Expression in Transla∣tions from the Hebrew and though we find the manner of expression very different from the Text in the d Chapter there being here a  feminine  Relative instead of a  masculine  Relative the Verb being also varied from  plural  to  singular  and the noun  Name entirely omitted yet the sense according  to this most literal ren∣dering  is not only  consonant  and  parallel  to the former passage but also strictly  scriptural  For  Jehovah  cer∣tainly CALLED TO  Jerusalem and her Inhabitants  both  before and after that Prophecy of Jeremiah  I have called unto them  said JEHOVAH speaking to the In∣habitants of  Jerusalem  by Jeremiah Chap xxxv  but they have not answered  Here is the very same verb  to call  and the preposition  prefixed in like manner to the pronoun following the verb so that the expression is the same And again we read in the Prophet Micah vi  The Voice of Jehovah shall  CALL TO  the City  Here the very same Verb  is used in the same sense  shall call  and in the two preceding Chapters  Sion  is called upon under the figure of A WOMAN  Be in pain and labour to bring forth  O DAUGHTER OF ZION LIKE A WOMAN  in Travail  c  Thou shalt go even to Babylon c  Chap iv  And again in the th Chapter st Verse  Gather thyself in TroopsO Daughter of Troops  manifestly refering to  the Daughter of Zion  mentioned in the preceding Verse  he hath laid siege against us they shall smite  THE JUDGE OF ISRAEL  with a rod upon the Cheek  c And who is this JUDGE OF ISRAEL Surely it is the Divine WORD who not only by his Prophets in ancient times  "  Are not these the Words which  JEHOVAH  hath  CALLED"  called  or  proclaimed  i e to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem  "by the former Prophets when  JERUSALEM  was inhabited"  cZech vii Here the Verb  to call  is used in the very same sense that I have given to it in the Text of Jeremiah now under consideration  but also in his own Person as  Son of God  and  Son of Man  CALLED TO THE CITY and its unwary inhabitantsWho said by Isaiah  I have  spread out my hands all the Day unto a rebellious People  c  Ch lxv    But they refused to hearken and pulled away the Shoulder and stopped their Ears that they should not hear Yea they made their hearts  as  an Adamant Stone lest they should hear the Law and the Words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent  IN HIS SPIRIT  by the hand of the former Prophets therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of Hosts Therefore it came to pass  that  as  HE CALLED    the same Verb still used in the same sense  and they would not hear so  THEY SHALL CALL    in the future Tense    and I will not hear      saith  JEHOVAH  of Hosts and  I WILL  scatter them    still in the future Tense and be pleased to remark that the prophecy of this  scattering  or  dispersion  was delivered by Zechariah  after  the return of  Israel  and  Judah  from their former  dispersion  in the Provinces of Babylon but this  future Dispersion  was to be much more notorious and general  I will  SCATTER  them with a whirlwind  AMONG ALL THE NATIONS  whom they knew not c  Zech vii  From this last dreadful and  general Dispersion  the Jews have never yet returned to their own proper Country but  the Land is  still  desolate after them  see the th Verse  having been ever since possessed and plundered by  stand∣ing Armies  the bane of Mankind consisting alternately of various foreign Nations and the frightful  desolation  of that Devoted Land has been continued and pro∣longed by the detestable  Arbitrary Governments  of Ara∣bians Turks and such other foreign Despots the  Scourges of Mankind  For they laid the pleasant Land desolate  This  determined Vengeance  against the Jews viz  "They  SHALL CALL  and I will not hear"  c was lamented in the most affecting Terms by "THE JUDGE OF ISRAEL" abovementioned whom they  smote  and  despised  for  he called and they would not hear    O JERUSALEM JERUSALEM  that killest the Prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee  HOW OFTEN WOULD I HAVE GATHERED THY CHILDREN TOGETHER  even as a hen gathereth her Chickens under  her  wings and  YE WOULD NOT  Be∣hold your House is left unto you  DESOLATE  For I say unto you Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord  Matt xxiii  May God of his infinite Mercy hasten that time and give grace to the Descendants of his once  peculiar people  that they may acknowledge  the true Shepherd and King of Israel  and be collected from this fatal  dispersion  which hath already endured more than YEARS Then will they know and declare that  the Branch of  RIGHTEOUSNESS  that grew up unto David and executed judgement and  RIGHTEOUS∣NESS  in the Land  is he that CALLED TO HER    that is  to Jerusalem  Jer xxxiii and that  this is  HIS NAME  which they shall  call  JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  Jer xxiii  Nay some of the most learned Rabbins have declared long ago that this is the title of the  Messiah  and even Grotius himself who applies this Title to THE CITY  hic de  CIVITATE  agitur  see on Jer xxxiii  yet ac∣knowledges that not only Christians but also the learned  Rabbi KIMCHI refers it in a more sublime sense to the MESSIAH  Sensu sublimiore non Christiani tantum sed et  KIMCHI  hoc ad Messiam refert  And therefore if all the Texts above cited be duly compared and considered it must appear that the Title  "Jehovah our Righteousness"  is not applied by Jeremiah xxxiii to JERUSALEM but to him who as the prophet said  shall call her  This it seems has been the opinion of  several Interpreters particularly  HUE∣TIUS  Demonstr Evang Prop  vii  cap    and our learned  Bishop PEARSON  in the Notes upon his exposition of the Creed  p  who as the abovementioned Mr Lowth acknowledges  'render the Words thus'  "HE THAT SHALL CALL HER" i e  to be his pecu∣liar people  "IS THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" See also the Old English Translation by Tindal printed in  And  HE THAT SHAL CAL HER  is even God our Ryghteous Maker  In the Old Version called the Bishop's Bible we read  And he that shall call her is even God our righteousnesse  And in the common English Version printed by the King's Printer in we find nearly the same rendering  And hee that shall call her is the Lord our righteousnesse  These are suffi∣cient authorities I trust for what I have asserted in this note and for the translation which I have ventured to make of the Text in question and therefore if all the Texts also above cited be duly compared and considered it must appear that the Title  JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS  was NOT applied by Jeremiah to  Jerusalem  but only to the  Righteous Branch  which as he foretold  grew up to David  and  called to her  are in like manner esteemed ONE because all distinctions  of  Nation Rank  and  Dignity  and even of  Sex  are set aside in the true Church  There  is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor  female for ye are all  ONE  in  CHRIST JESUS  And if ye  be CHRIST'S  then  are ye  ABRAHAM'S SEED  and Heirs according to the promise  Gal iii    Thus the Faithful are  one in  Christ  but surely not  with Christ  I  mean not  with  him in the UNITY  of  Power Glory  and  Eternal Existence  wherein he and the Holy Ghost are and ever were included with the Almighty Father  The Unity  of the Church is indeed in some respects as I have shewn LIKE  the Unity  of THE FATHER and THE SON but it is not  the same Unity  as the Socinians would insinuate  This attempt of the Socinians to exclude the doctrine of Christ's  Divine Dignity  which necessarily arises from the repeated declarations in Scripture that  the Father  and  the Son  are ONE is vain and futile because the many circumstances of  Divine Omnipotence  and  Eternal Existence  already recited in which they are ONE cannot without blasphemy be attributed to  the Church  or to that other  Unity  wherein the Church is included  in the Father and the Son  In the Communion Service of the Church of England indeed mention is made of our  Unity  WITH  Christ    We are  ONE WITH  Christ and Christ  WITH  us  see Exhortation at the time of the Celebration c but this has not the least reference to  the Unity of Christ  WITH  the Father  but only to the de∣clared  Unity  of the Faithful who form that  one Building  whereof Christ is the  chief Corner  Stone  In whom all  THE BUILDING  fitly framed together groweth unto  AN HOLY TEMPLE  in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of  GOD  through the Spirit  Eph ii  So that all faithful disciples are undoubtedly ONE  in Christ  that is ONE "  Holy Temple  With respect to the  "One Holy Temple"  we may say that the Faithful are  One  either  in  or  with  Christ because Christ is called  "the chief Corner"  and  the Head  And gave him to be  HEAD  over all  things  to the Church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all  Eph i  of the Church and consequently in this figure is esteemed  a part of the Church  " or ONE  Catholick Church  even as  the Father  and the Son are ONE but it must appear from the several texts already quoted if they are duly compared and weighed together that  the Unity of the Church in Christ  is not mentioned as  the same Unity  wherein  the Father and the Son are  ONE viz  One  in  Power Glory  and  Eternal Existence  or  One  GOD but only as a resemblance or illustration  in some respects  of that DIVINE UNITY  In  some respects  I say as being  united  in  Will  or in  Divine Love  as I have already shewn or by the inspiration of the HOLY SPIRIT in each individual  through which  the whole Congregation of the Faithful that are  "builded together"  in Christ become "  an Habitation of  GOD" see the text last quoted from Eph ii but not  in all respects  because there are many circumstances some of which I have already mentioned wherein the Unity or Fellowship of Christ with the Heavenly Father is infinitely transcen∣dent and such as cannot without Blas∣phemy be attributed to the redeemed Brethren or those that are  merely  Mem∣bers of the Church so that the  Socinian  objection to the doctrine which neces∣sarily arises from the several texts where∣in  the Father and the Son  are declared to be ONE is apparently unjust and false May any other  Man  but  the Man Christ Jesus  Tim ii  say as he did  ALL THINGS THAT THE  FATHER HATH ARE MINE  John xvi  And again  "As the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father"  John x or as Christ expressed himself to his Heavenly Father in Prayer  And now O Father  GLORIFY THOU ME WITH THINE OWN SELF WITH THE GLORY  which I had with thee before the world was  John xvii  Thus Christ declares his right to be  glorified with the Heavenly Father himself  which must mean  to be glorified with  SUPREME GLORY as it is  the Glory  of the Al∣mighty Father  "the Glory which"  the Son had with his Almighty Father  "before the world was"  This glorious Person assumed  the  NATURE OF MAN and for a time dwelt among men that he might  "fulfill all righteousness"  Mat iii even in his  Human Nature  and thereby restore the lost dignity and pri∣vileges of  that Nature    the first Man  being  of the Earth earthy  but  the Second  MAN THE LORD FROM HEAVEN  Cor xv  Human  Nature  therefore is indeed exalted to  eternal Glory  but that is only  in by  and  through him  who alone is  truly  and  essentially  the "SON OF GOD" as well as the "SON OF MAN" For he is  the Way and the Truth and the Life No man cometh unto the Father  said our Lord  but by me  John xiv  The miserable state of fallen MAN is already described in the former part of this Tract The means of retrieving our lost dignity remains still to be shewn God has mercifully revealed to us these necessary means and tendered them in the Scriptures to our  Choice  that by a prudent use of  the Knowledge of Good and Evil  we may constantly prefer and  chuse the Good  earnestly claiming the pro∣mises of  Divine Assistance  whereby we shall also be enabled to  reject the Evil  on all occasions and effectually to resist  the Spiritual Enemy  and maintain our inte∣grity in the severest trials of our Faith for  in all these things we are more than  Conquerors through him that loved us  Rom viii  Thus the device of SATAN in pro∣moting MAN'S assumption of  forbidden Knowledge  is compleatly turned against himself for that very KNOWLEDGE which through his deceit and tempta∣tion subjected  all Mankind  to SIN and  Death  is now through the mercy of God become a proper  Principle of Action  if we use it as we ought to incline us to RIGHTEOUSNESS and lead us to "  the Tree of Life  The hereditary  KNOWLEDGE  of Good and Evil  which our first parents unlawfully took upon themselves by eating of "THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE" is shewn in the beginning of this Tract to be a  Divine Knowledge  such as must have originally proceeded from GOD and as THE DIVINE WORD which "  was with  GOD" and "  was  GOD" John i is declared also to be  the true  LIGHT  which  LIGHTETH  every man that cometh into the world  John i  we may perhaps without im∣propriety conceive that the said  Divine Knowledge  of which man unlawfully partook was in some way or other originally communicated to the  Tree of Knowledge  in Paradise by the ETERNAL WORD because LIGHT and KNOWLEDGE when mentioned as  mental Properties  are certainly synonymous terms so that to impart KNOW∣LEDGE  to every man  is the same thing as to LIGHT or ENLIGHTEN  every man that cometh into the world  But whether this conjecture be true or not yet we are certain that we can have no hopes of regaining the privileges which were lost by the former fatal disobedience except through CHRIST alone for to him are attributed all the properties of "THE TREE OF LIFE  From which our beguiled ancestor was unhappily excluded being driven from paradise  lest he  should  put forth his hand and  TAKE  also of  THE TREE OF LIFE  and  EAT  and  LIVE  for ever  Gen iii  " so that in Him we may truly partake of such benefits as are amply sufficient to restore  the original Dignity of  MAN  And this is the record that  GOD  hath given to us  ETER∣NAL LIFE  and this  LIFE  is in his  SON  He that hath the Son hath  LIFE and  he that hath not  THE SON OF GOD  hath not  LIFE  These things have I written unto you that believe on the Name of  THE SON OF GOD  that ye may know that ye have  ETERNAL LIFE  and that ye may believe on the Name of the  SON OF GOD  John v  He that hath an ear let him hear what  THE SPIRIT  saith unto the Churches To him that overcometh  WILL  I  GIVE  THE SPIRIT here speaks in his own Name and thereby declares his own Omnipotence and DIVINE NATURE"  To him will I  GIVE" saith the Spirit  to eat of the  TREE OF LIFE  which is in the midst of the Paradise of God  Rev ii  Therefore to "  eat of the Tree of  LIFE" is ma∣nifestly a  spiritual  repast though  real  in its eternal effects which are undoubtedly the same as those we expect in Christ  As the  LIVING FATHER  hath sent me  said  our Lord  and I  LIVE  by the Father so he that  EAT∣ETH ME  even he  SHALL LIVE  by me This is that bread which came down from heaven not as your Fathers did eat Manna and are dead He that  EATETH  of this bread  SHALL LIVE FOR EVER  John vi  Christ is therefore in a most effectual manner to us  THE TREE OF LIFE  and accordingly he himself has as∣sured us in the strongest terms  VERILY VERILY  I say unto you Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood ye have no  LIFE  in you Whose eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal  LIFE  and I will raise him at the last day For my  FLESH  is  MEAT INDEED    "TRULY SO"  and  MY BLOOD  is  DRINK INDEED  c  John vi  Now as  the eating the flesh of the Son of Man and drinking his blood    EXCEPT YE EAT cYE HAVE NO LIFE  in you  c is thus declared to be absolutely necessary for us of course THE MEANS given us of DOING SO demand our most serious consideration especially as they were expressly and clearly revealed to the Apostles in the solemn hour of Christ's latest instruc∣tions  The Apostle Paul relates the  last commands  of Christ on this subject as they were revealed to him by our Lord himself even after his ascension whereby the necessity and importance of them are still further confirmed viz  That  THE LORD JESUS  the night he was betrayed took  BREAD  and when he had given thanks he brake  it  and said Take eat  THIS IS MY BODY  which is broken for you  THIS DO    manifestly directing his disciples to use the solemn ceremony of breaking bread AS HE HAD DONE  in  remembrance  said he  of me  After the same manner also the CUP  when he had supped  saying  THIS CUP  is the New Testament  or New Covenant  in my blood  THIS DO YE  as oft as ye drink  it  in remembrance of me  Thus far the Apostle relates  the com∣mands of Christ  which clearly relate to what our Lord himself had before declared concerning the necessity of  eating his flesh and drink∣ing his blood  so that this solemn ceremony of  Bread and Wine  is manifestly the means he had given us of  doing so  because our Lord declared of the  BreadThis is my Body  c adn of the  Cup This is the New Covenant in my blood  c And therefore we may be assured that all persons who sincerely and with due faith and disposition partake of these two outward symbols of his  Body  and  Blood  in remembrance of him  according to the form which he himself so expressly instituted do most certainly in a  spiritual  manner partake also of  "the Tree of Life"  agreeable to the promise of THE SPIRIT  "to him that overcometh"  THE BREAD is no otherwise THE BODY OF CHRIST than as it is used in this institutionviz  received  and  eaten  in  remembrance of Christ  by which we have  Communion of his  Body  Cor x For we have no authority whatever to esteem it the  Body of Christ  in any other respect so that for all other purposes and uses whatsoever it cannot be allowed  so much as the Name  of any thing else but what it really is  mere Bread  even when it is held up to be worshipped and therefore that Church which uses it in suth an unjustifiable manner is certainly guilty of the grossest idolatry  which confirms the doctrine of their necessity and importance  As our Lord had before declared  My flesh is  MEAT  FOOD from thence the German BROAT and English word BREAD  INDEED  and my blood is  DRINK INDEED  he now substituted the real viands of  bread    or FOOD INDEED and wine  drink indeed  as the outward symbols of that FLESH and BLOOD that spiritual  meat  and  drink  for the soul of which all persons must of necessity partake who hope for ETERNAL LIFE  Blessed are they that do his com∣mandments that they may have right to the  TREE OF LIFE  c  Rev xxii  But we  must remember at the same time that this  Knowledge  in Man is far from being of  itself sufficient for these purposes The dignity and privileges of  Human Nature  cannot be known nor the manner of communicating them properly under∣stood without a  right Faith  in the Dig∣nity and  Divine Nature  of  Christ  be∣cause  in  his Promises  alone our title to those extraordinary Privileges is founded  Whatsoever ye shall ask  IN MY NAME  said our Lord JESUS  that  WILL I DO  a clear proof of his Divine Nature  that the Father  said he  may be glorified in the Son If ye shall ask any thing in  MY NAME  said our Lord again  I WILL DO IT c  John xiv  A right Faith therefore concerning the true Dignity of that Divine Person  in whose Name  we hope to obtain the heavenly Gift of the Holy Ghost is undoubtedly necessary and we must  "give him the honour due unto his Name"  or the very mention of that Name in∣stead of intitling us to favour would be an offence to God who  hath highly  exalted  his only begotten Son  and given him  A NAME  which is above  EVERY NAME  that at the  NAME  of  JESUS  every knee should bow of  things  in heaven and  things  in earth and  things  under the earth and that every tongue should confess  THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD  to  THE GLORY OF GOD  the Father  Philip ii  Neither is there salvation in any other for there is  NONE OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN  given among Men whereby we must be saved  Acts iv  For as the Father raised up the dead and quickeneth them even so the Son quickeneth whom he will  John v  In a preceding verse viz th our Lord in like manner compared with a seeming insinuation of equality his own works with the works of his Father  My Father worketh hitherto  said he  and I work  The  Father which worketh hitherto  was clearly understood by the Jews to signify the  Almighty Father  the  Worker  or  Maker of all things  and therefore they could neither brook the mention he made in the same sentence of his own  working  nor the particular claim which our Lord expressed in that sen∣tence to the Almighty Father as his peculiar  Father  calling him  My Father  instead of  Our Father  as the common Parent or Creator of Mankind  All this is plainly implied in the fol∣lowing verse and  therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath  viz by his  miraculous Works  in  healing the Sick  and doing good    but said also that  GOD WAS HIS FATHER  said that God was his proper or peculiar Father  making himself  EQUAL  with God  For to call God  his peculiar Father was  justly  esteemed by the Jews the same thing as making himself  "equal with God"  though they were  unjustly  incensed at it through a want of due attention to the mighty  Works  similar to those of the Almighty Father to which Christ appealed as a proof that he was really  the Son of God  That SUPREME HONOUR is therefore due unto THE NAME AND PERSON OF THE SON our Blessed Redeemer who for OUR SAKE took THE NATURE OF MAN upon himself is manifest because we are expressly commanded to  honour the Son even as we honour the Father  so that we cannot exceed  FOR THE FATHER JUDGETH NO MAN  but hath committed  ALL JUDGMENT UN∣TO THE SON  that all  Men  should honour  THE SON  even as they honour  THE FATHER  And again  He that honoureth not the Son ho∣noureth not the Father which hath sent him  John v  To "honour the Son"  from  and    according as  or  even as  they "honour the Father" would be ido∣latry if the Son was not a Divine Per∣son really and truly God from all Eter∣nity Because the God of Israel the Eternal and Everlasting  Jehovah and Creator of all things  Thus saith God the Lord  or Jehovah  he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it  and Spirit  to them that walk therein I the Lord have called thee  that is Christ  in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and will give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles c  Isai xlii  at the very time that he promised this Glori∣ous Redeemer  for a Covenant of the people for a Light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the  PRISONERS  from the  PRISON  that  is from the bondage and slavery of Satan  and them that sit in darkness out of the  PRISONHOUSE  he im∣mediately added in the very next sen∣tence  I am the  LORD  or  Jehovah  THAT IS MY NAME  and my  GLO∣RY  will I not give to  ANOTHER  c  Isai xlii  It is impossible therefore that the Supreme God JEHOVAH should  give his Glory  or require Men  to honour the Son even as they honour the Father  if the Son was  another  or not in Unity or  One  with the Father in the  Eternal Being  of the One God I mean if he was not included in the  One  Eternal Divine  Being  which is but ONE  One  Jehovah that is UNITY ITSELF and therefore incapable of dif∣ferent Degrees or  Inequality  Hear O Israel  said Moses  the Lord  or Jehovah  our God is One Lord  or  ONE  Jehovah    Deut vi  And yet we find that this glorious Name of the One Eternal God of Israel viz Jehovah  is manifestly attri∣buted both in the Old and New Testa∣ments as I have already shewn to the Messiah as a distinct Person from the Father and therefore when we read our Lord's expression in John xiv  "My Father is greater than I"  we must necessarily understand that no comparative reference can possibly have been intended thereby nor is to be made concerning the  Divine Nature  or  Godhead  which certainly is but  One  viz "ONE JEHOVAH" as the text expressly declares and consequently we must acknowledge with the Author of the Creed commonly attributed to Athanasius that  the Son is equal to the Father as touching his Godhead  viz the  One Eternal Being  or Jehovah  though inferior to the Father as touch∣ing  his Manhood  or his Mediatorial Office for in some such qualified sense we must of course understand our Lord's expression in John  The Father is greater than I  beforementioned for those Men who venture to assert that the Inferiority of the Son consists in his  Divine Nature  must evidently suppose a  Superior  and  Inferior  Divine Nature and consequently that there are Two  Divine Natures  which Idea the Scriptures expressly forbid  JEHO∣VAH OUR GOD  is  ONE JEHOVAH  Deut vi  And therefore as the Son is also JEHOVAH we are bound by the Scriptures to believe that he is of the same  Divine Nature  with the Father in that  One Eternal  Being agreeable to what he himself has declared  I and the Father are One    John x  And as the  Plurality  of Persons is clearly expressed in the latter text by the  Plural  Verb    we  are  so the word    One  evidently de∣monstrates the UNITY and EQUALITY of  their Divine Nature  for it is no less evident from the context that the said word  ONE refers to the  Being of God  or Jehovah and was intended to express the  Unity  of their  Divine Nature    the Divine Nature  or  Godhead  Acts xvii which can be but  One      One Godhead  as there is but  One God  Tim ii  James ii  The Jews it is plain understood the expression in that sense and immediately charged our Lord with  Blasphemy  saying  Because that thou being a Man makest thyself God  And though our Lord condescended to cite a passage from the Psalms wherein the title  of Gods  is applied to  mere Men  viz  I said ye are Gods  in order to shew that the Scriptures  would not be broken  by the consequence which they had drawn from his expression yet he im∣mediately after maintains the evident meaning of his first expression as it was  at first  understood by the Jews  and by a fair comparison shewed his infinite superiority over them that were called  Gods  in the Law  If he  said our Lord meaning the Prophet David  called them  GODS  unto whom the Word of  GOD  came and the Scripture can∣not be broken say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because I said I am  THE SON OF GOD  And our Lord immediately added an incontestable proof of his being GOD not merely in a  confined qualified Sense  like those  Men  called GODS in Scripture  I have said Ye  are GODS  and all of you  are  children  or SONS  of the most High  Psa lxxxii  The whole Psalm is plainly intended as a reproof and warning to wicked  Rulers  or wicked  Judges  whom the inspired Psalmist calls  Gods  probably because they ought to act as  God's Vicegerents  on earth in  judging righteously  according to GOD'S LAW as Moses  charg∣ed them    Ye shall not respect persons in judgment  but  ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not  be afraid of the face of man  FOR THE JUDGMENT IS GOD'S  c  Deut i  or as King  Jehoshaphat  afterwards warned his  Judges  in a most excellent charge which ought to be wrote in letters of gold on the most conspicuous part of every Court of  Judicature  viz  Take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man  BUT FOR THE LORD WHO IS WITH YOU IN THE JUDGMENT  Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon youTake heed and do it for  there is  no iniquity with  THE LORD OUR GOD  nor respect of per∣sons nor taking of gifts  Chron xix  It is obvious therefore when these texts are duly considered that  Judges and Magistrates  are called GODS by the Psalmist only in a confined and qualified sense because they  "judge not for man but for the Lord"  and because  "the judgment is God's"  and though in the same sen∣tence they are called "SONS OF THE MOST HIGH" yet this is no disparagement or lessening to the title and dig∣nity of the REAL SON OF GOD because the former which are mere  men  by nature are no otherwise  SONS  of the most High  than by  Adoption  for the sake of the REAL SON who was  not ashamed  to call them BRETHREN  I will declare thy Name unto MY BRETHREN  Psa xxii  And again  Who are  MY BRETHREN And he stretched out his  hands towards his disciples and said Behold my  Mother and  MY BRETHREN For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven the same is my BROTHER c  Mat xii    Heb ii  and even vouchsafed to take  Human Nature  upon himself and to become also  "THE SON OF MAN" that he might be our BROTHER indeed and the Restorer of  Human Dignity  in his own Person  The quotation made by our Lord John x from the d Psalm viz "I SAID  ye are Gods"  manifestly refers us back to a preceding expression in the st verse of the same Psalm wherein the inspired Psalmist had "SAID" that God "  judgeth among  THE GODS"meaning  the congregation of God  mentioned in the beginning of the same verse  God standeth in  THE CONGREGATION OF GOD  he judgeth among  THE "GODS  How long will ye judge unjustly  c The whole Psalm as I have before remarked is a reproof or warning to  unjust Judges  who are here called GODS apparently in no other sense than what I have already described  The con∣gregation of God    and  signifies for the most part the  main body of the people  or  the congregation of the Israelites in general  as in Numbers xxvii and xxxi and also in Joshua xxii but in the text before us when the subject of the con∣text is duly considered the expression seems to mean  the congregation  or  assembly of the Judges  or  Senators of the people  and not the whole  "Congregation of God"  though indeed the said assembly was  the proper representative  of the whole  "Congregation of God"  because  the Judges Magistrates  and other Officers were originally ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AS ALL MAGISTRATES and PUB∣LICK  OFFICERS in strict justice OUGHT TO BE We read indeed that Moses  CHOSE  able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people  Exod xviii  but in fact  "the able men"  were chosen  by the people  and not  by Moses  though it is here said that  "he chose"  them as it was  indeed  by HIS advice that they were  chosen  agreeable to the council and proposal of Jethro related in the preceding context for in the first chapter of Deuteronomy wherein Moses begins to repeat the history of former transactions he relates this amongst the rest in terms which clearly shew that  the election  of the  "able men"  was BY THE PEOPLE  I spake unto you  says he  at that time saying I am not able to bear you myself alone the Lord your God hath multiplied you  c  How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife  TAKE YE    CHUSE YE TO YOURSELVES  In the Hebrew  says the learned Bp Patrick  it is  GIVE YE  i e  present unto me  says he  such persons  AS YOU THINK FIT  according to the following characters  WISE MEN  and  UNDER∣STANDING  and  KNOWN AMONG YOUR  TRIBES  c Thus the learned Bishop's paraphrase amounts to the full meaning of my interpretation above  "Chuse ye to yourselves"  But there is no need of a paraphrase to justify this rendering the word  indeed literally signifies GIVE YE as the Bishop remarks but neither  his Lordship nor the English version have taken any notice of the word which immediately follows it viz    TO YOUR∣SELVES  for when these two words come together  they form  a phrase  which construed literally indeed it  Give ye to yourselves    as the DXX have  literally  rendered it but as such a sentence necessarily implies  a choice  the phrase is much better expressed when rendered  "Chuse ye to yourselves"  as above above which is the version of the  Syriac  "Chuse ye to yourselves"  both in this text and in Joshua xviii where the same Hebrew phrase occurs    CHUSE YE TO YOURSELVES  three Men for each Tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come  again  to me  c Thus Joshua also as a faithful  Minister of State  under GOD was careful to maintain  the popular Rights of Election  and to promote them by his advice Even a survey of the country in his opinion it seems was not to be trusted to any publick officers or commissioners what∣ever but such as were duly  chosen by the people  and those  in equal proportions  for each Tribe  Chuse ye to yourselves  said he  three Men for each Tribe  c  wise men and understanding and  KNOWN AMONG YOUR TRIBES  which necessarily implies that the Tribes were to NOMINATE  and I  said Moses  will make them Rulers over you  i e the returns of the elections were to be made to Moses and he was to invest  the Elected  with publick authority  And ye  said Moses  answered me and saidThe thing which thou hast spoken  is  good  for us  to do  Thus Moses like a good politician and faithful publick minister under under God declared  the free assent of the people  whereby the important measure he had  proposed  by the advice of  JETHRO was  enacted  and became a publick LAW or STATUTE  So I took  said Moses  the Chief of your Tribes wise men and known  that is  "known among the Tribes" as expressed in the th verse which necessary  qualification  could not fairly be ascer∣tained unless the  known  men were really  returned  or  named  to Moses as such by the Tribes themselves  and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your Tribes  Thus it appears that the officers in general from  the colonel  or captain of a thousand whether of  individuals  or  fa∣milies  down to  the serjeant  or tythingman were recom∣mended or  nominated  by the people before they were in∣vested with authority by Moses And I charged your  JUDGES  at that time whereby it must of course be understood that the JUDGES also had been previously nominated by the people as  wise men and understanding and known among the Tribes  agreeable to the preceding  enacted  proposal  saying Hear  the causes  between your brethren and  JUDGE  righteously between  every  man and his brother and the stranger  that is  with him Ye shall not respect persons in judgment  c Deut i The remainder of the excellent charge I have quoted aboveI have thus far digressed from my subject not only for the sake of explaining several texts of Scripture which occurred to me in the course of my argument but also for the honour of  Human Nature  to shew  the glori∣ous  State of Political Liberty  with which God was pleased to bless his people ISRAEL and in which he would most certainly have maintained them if they had per∣severed in  the right Faith  and in due obedience to  his Laws  But when men forsake GOD they unavoidably lose their LIBERTY  but GOD also  in Effect  and  Power    If  I do not  THE WORKS OF MY FA∣THER  continued our Lord  be∣lieve me not  BUT IF I DO  though  you believe not me  BELIEVE THE WORKS  that ye may know and  BE∣LIEVE  that the  FATHER  is  IN ME  and I  IN HIM  John x  This reference to  the Works of the Father  was a manifest appeal of Christ to the understanding of his hearers concerning the peculiar manner in which  he was  really God  and of the same  Divine Nature  with THE FATHER agreeable to the obvious sense of his  first proposition  I and the Father are One  ver  and the unbe∣lieving Jews notwithstanding their  men∣tal  blindness and hardness of heart  fore∣told by their own Prophets as plainly  understood  that the necessary effect of this argument was exactly the same upon the whole that they at first ap∣prehended viz that he  MADE HIM∣SELF  i e declared himself to be  really    GOD  and therefore they im∣mediately renewed their wicked perse∣cution as at first for  they sought again to take him  says the text  but he escaped out of their hand  ver  My readers may perhaps think that I prolong my work too much and ren∣der it tedious by inserting so many proofs concerning the  Divine Nature of  THE SON OF GOD but alas I find that my labour on this point is become necessary Many learned men and some  even of my own particular friends have unhappily overlooked that indispensable doctrine and do not perceive that the glorious Name JEHOVAH the peculiar Name of THE ONE SUPREME GOD is clearly in the Scriptures attributed also to  the Son of God  And we cannot rightly understand  the Nature and Dig∣nity of  MAN which is my leading sub∣ject in this Tract nor the true value of THE PRICE which was given for MAN'S REDEMPTION as we  are bought with  A PRICE  Cor vi  unless we are truly sensible of  the Nature and Dignity  as far as God has revealed it to us in the Scriptures of that Di∣vine Person who took  Human Nature  upon himself in order to restore the lost  Dignity  and  Privileges  of  fallen  MAN  One of my learned friends though a sensible and worthy man amongst other arguments and quotations against my doctrine remarks as follows  The Apostle Paul  says he  saith in Ephes  i  that  THE GOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THE FATHER OF GLORY    SET HIM AT HIS OWN RIGHT HAND  Hence  says my learned friend  it necessarily follows that Christ is not Jehovah but the Son of JehovahGod who made the worlds by his Son is the Father of Christ  Heb i  See likewise says he Isaiah xi  The Spirit of  JEHOVAH  shall rest upon him    Also Isai  lxi  The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because  JEHOVAH  hath anointed me to preach  c  com∣pared with Luke  iv  Now that Christ is  the Son of God  or as my friend stiles him  the Son of Jehovah  I will declare the decree  THE LORD  in the He∣brew JEHOVAH  hath said unto me Thou art  MY SON  this day have  I BEGOTTEN THEE  Psal ii    every true Christian must  readily allow to be a true and indispen∣sable doctrine but it by no means  fol∣lows  from thence though my friend says it  necessarily follows    that Christ is not Jehovah  To the direct con∣trary of my friend's assertion I am obliged to remark that  as Christ is the Son of Jehovah and the Son of God  in a  peculiar  and  essential  manner  Christ is in a  peculiar  and  essential  manner the  Son of God  because he  proceeded forth and came out of God  see p  and is expressly called  THE ONLY BEGOTTEN  of the Almighty Father  And the  WORD  was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of  THE ONLY BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER  full of grace and truth  John i  And again  GOD  so loved the world that he gave  HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life For  GOD  sent not  HIS SON  into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved He that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is con∣demned already because he hath not believed in the name of  THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD  John iii    it ne∣cessarily follows  from thence that he is also really and truly GOD and JEHOVAH in an  essential  manner for  as a  SON must necessarily partake of the  Nature  or  Essence  of his natural FATHER so "THE SON OF JEHOVAH" must neces∣sarily be of the same  Nature Being  or  Essence  with his ALMIGHTY FATHER JEHOVAH and as there is but ONE JEHOVAH must necessarily in some way or other though incomprehensible to us at present be included in that ONE  Eternal  BEING The very circum∣stance which my friend assigns as a proof that "  the Son  is NOT JEHOVAH" was esteemed by the unbelieving Jews when our Lord was on earth as a proof that he  made himself equal with God  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath  that is as they falsely alledged because he had healed the Sick and done good on the Sabbath Day which was certainly lawful  but said also that  GOD WAS HIS FA∣THER    his  own proper  or  peculiar  Father that is his Father  in a  real  or  essential  manner and this it seems is the very reason which my friend has assigned as a proof that  Christ is not Jehovah  but which on the contrary the Jews rightly esteemed to be the same thing as  making him∣self  EQUAL WITH GOD  John v  Our Lord was so far from denying the truth of  the consequential Doctrine  which the Jews had drawn from his having said that  "God was his Father"  "his  own proper Father"  that he immediately in the very next verse appealed to  his works  for the truth of it  Then answered Jesus and said unto them Verily Verily I say unto you the Son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the Father do  shewing thereby that  the Father  is in∣deed the Fountain of Power but im∣mediately afterwards he shews likewise  that he himself as being  Son of the Al∣mighty Father  was therefore  equal in Power with  THE FATHER  for what things soever he  that is the Father  doeth  said our Lord  THESE ALSO DOETH THE SON LIKEWISE  or  in like manner  which is surely such an ample declaration of his  own Almighty Power  as could not be true were he not really JEHOVAH  For the Father  continued our Lord  loveth the Son and sheweth him  ALL THINGS THAT HIMSELF DOETH  and he will shew him greater  WORKS THAN THESE  alluding to the mighty WORKS by which he proved himself to be "THE SON OF JEHOVAH"  that ye may marvel  said he  For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth  them EVEN SO THE SON QUICKENETH WHOM HE WILL  Another incontestable declaration of AL∣MIGHTY POWER such as cannot be at∣tributed  to any that is not TRULY GOD though it is certainly an especial  Attri∣bute  of him that is called  "THE PRINCE or Author OF LIFE  But ye denied the Holy One and the Just  said the Apostle Peter to the Jews  and desired a murderer to be granted unto you And killed  THE PRINCE OF LIFE  whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses and  HIS NAME  i e the Name of JESUS as a proof that he hath  LIFE IN HIMSELF John v and QUICKENETH WHOM HE WILL    through faith in  HIS NAME  hath made this man strong whom ye see and know c  Acts iii  For as the Prophets of old wrought miracles in the Name of JEHOVAH so the Apostles and Primitive Christians wrought miracles in the Name of JESUS to prove that he was the  Son of Jehovah  and consequently is truly  God  and  Lord    For the Father  continues our Lord  judgeth no man but hath committed  ALL JUDGMENT  unto the Son that all  men  should honour  Which  Honour  as I have before remarked im∣plies  supreme Honour  and  Worship  such as would be gross idolatry if THE SON was not truly JEHOVAH because  the Law  which Christ came to fulfill  Think not that I am come to destroy  THE LAW  or  THE PRO∣PHETS  I am not come to destroy but  TO FULFIL  For verily I say unto you Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from  THE LAW  till all be fulfilled  Matth v  declares expressly  Thou shalt fear  JEHOVAH THY GOD  him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave c  Deut x  And this Law Christ himself in his quotation of it has taught us to understand as an injunction to serve and fear JEHOVAH  only  or  exclusively  of every other BEING  for it it written  said our Lord  Thou shalt worship  THE LORD THY GOD    for "JEHOVAH  thy God" "and him  ONLY  shalt thou serve"  or worship  Matth iv whereas if  the Son  was not truly JEHOVAH this also would be an irreconcilable contradiction to the command abovementioned that  all men should honour the Son even as  they honour the Father  the Son even as they honour the Fa∣ther  And as  supreme Honour  is certainly due to THE FATHER we  must of course honour THE SON with  supreme Honour  EVEN AS    we honour the Father  This is so ne∣cessary a part of the Christian Duty that men cannot pay the proper honour to THE HEAVENLY FATHER unless they  thus honour  THE SON also with supreme Honour for  HE THAT HONOURETH NOT THE SON  that is  He that honoureth not the Son even  as he honoureth the Father  for this is necessarily implied from the preceding Context "HONOURETH NOT THE FA∣THER "  How dangerous therefore is the doctrine of some modern Clergymen who have seceded from the Church of England merely because the Litany and other Parts of our excellent Liturgy express  Divine Ho∣nour to  THE SON OF GOD What mental blindness not to perceive that we are bound to  honour  THE SON not merely for  his own sake  but also  for the sake of our  HEAVENLY FATHER  "which hath sent him"  that  the  FATHER in return may have mercy on us  for the sake  of  his  ONLY SON For the Scriptures assure us that we cannot  honour the Father  if we do not  honour the Son  and the Jews of old were warned by the Psalmist con∣cerning the necessity of  "Honouring the Son"  lest they should perish from the right way  Kiss  THE SON  lest he be angry and ye perish  from  the way  Psal ii The literal sense of this passage is fixed by the preceding context  I will declare the decree  JEHOVAH  hath said unto me Thou art  MY SON  this day have I begotten thee  v  WHICH HATH SENT HIM John v  The Scriptures attribute Eternal  Ho∣nour  and  Glory  to THE SON and that jointly with THE HEAVENLY FA∣THER    Blessing and  HONOUR  and  GLORY  and  POWER  be unto him that sitteth upon the throne  AND UNTO THE LAMB  for ever and ever And the four beasts  or animals  The Redeemed out of the twelve tribes of Israel which are represented by the figures that anciently distin∣guished the standards of the four principal tribes in their encampments round the tabernacle This opinion has been adopted by the great Sir Isaac Newton  The people of Israel  says he  in the wilderness en∣camped round about the tabernacle and on the east side were three tribes under the standard of  Judah  on the west were three tribes under the standard of  Ephraim  on the south were three tribes under the standard of  Reuben  and on the north were three tribes under the standard of  Dan  Numb ii And the standard of JUDAH was  a Lion  that of EPHRAIM  an ox  that of REUBEN  a man  and that of DAN  an eagle  as the Jews affirm  Compare this with Revel iv  And the first beast  was  like  A LION  and the second beast like  A CALF  and the third beast had a face as  A MAN  and the fourth beast  or animal was  like a  FLYING EAGLE  Rev iv    Whence were framed  says Sir Isaac Newton  the  Hieroglyphicks of  Cherubims  and  Seraphims  to repre∣present the people of  Israel  A  Cherubim  had one body with four faces the faces of a  lion  an  ox  a  man  and an  eagle  looking to the four winds of heaven without turning about as in Ezekiel's vision chap i And four  Seraphims  had the same four faces with four bodies one face to every body The four beasts are therefore four  Seraphims  standing in the four sides of the peoples court the first in the eastern side with the head of  a lion  the second in the western side c and all four signify together the twelve tribes of  Israel  out of whom the hundred and forty four thousand were sealed  Apoc vii Observ on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apoc p  representing the Redeemed Hosts of Israel  said  AMEN  Rev v See also the th verse  Thus we find that  HONOUR and GLORY and POWER  belong  UN∣TO THE LAMB FOR EVER  He had indeed  for a time  laid aside this SU∣PREME GLORY this  Glory  which is attributed to him jointly  with him that sitteth upon the Heavenly Throne  that he might become  "the Son of Man"  and  by Obedience  For as  BY ONE MAN'S DISOBEDIENCE  many were made sinners so  BY THE OBEDIENCE OF ONE  shall many be made righteous  Rom v  in fulfilling the Law  Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill  Matth v    and  all Righteous∣ness  And Jesus answering said unto him  John the Baptist  Suffer  it to be so  now for thus it be∣cometh us  TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS  Then he suffered him  Matth iii    even as A MAN might re∣trieve the dignity and lost privileges of HUMAN NATURE but the  Divine Glory  was again to be restored to him though he now partook of  the Nature  of his  Creature Man  nay the Son himself even when  a Man  claims  the Glory  of his Heavenly Father  And now O Father  said he  GLORI∣FY THOU ME WITH THINE OWN∣SELF WITH THE GLORY  which I had  WITH THEE  before the world was  John xvii See also p  It was not only in his  Divine Nature  that THE SON was to be thus  glorified  but expressly as "MAN" so that  the Nature of  MAN is indeed exalted in Christ to the highest pitch of glory  Behold  THE MAN  whose Name is  THE BRANCH  says the Prophet Zechariah  he shall grow up out of his place and he shall  BUILD THE TEM∣PLE  of the Lord  That is  "The Holy  TEMPLE  in the Lord"  i e in Christ  "in whom"  the Faithful  are  BUILD∣ED  together for an habitation of  GOD  through  THE SPIRIT  Ephes ii See also p  even he shall  BUILD THE TEMPLE  of the Lord and he shall  BEAR THE GLORY  that is  even he  THE MAN that is called  the Branch  shall BEAR THE GLORY  and shall  SIT  and  RULE UPON HIS THRONE  and he shall be  A PRIEST UPON HIS THRONE  that is a ROYAL PRIEST after the order of that  Righteous King  The Lord  Jehovah  hath sworn and will not repent Thou art  A PRIEST FOR EVER  after the order of  MELCHIZEDEK  or  "the righteous King"  Psa cx  Compare with Heb v and also with Heb vii  who was KING of SALEM or King of PEACE  For this  MELCHISEDEC  King of Salem Priest of the most High God who met Abraham returning from  the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation  KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  and after that also King of Salem which is King of Peace c  Heb vii    and the Counsel of  PEACE  shall  be between them both  Zechariah vi  The throne or kingdom here promised was also to be  an everlasting Kingdom  though given to Christ ex∣pressly as  "Son of Man"  for it is cer∣tainly the same Kingdom foretold by the Prophet  Daniel    I saw in the night visions  says Daniel  and behold  one  like  THE SON OF MAN  came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him And there was given him  DOMINION  and  GLORY  and  A KINGDOM  that all People Nations and Languages should serve him  HIS DOMINION IS AN EVER∣LASTING DOMINION WHICH SHALL NOT PASS AWAY  and  HIS KINGDOM that WHICH SHALL NOT BE DE∣STROYED  Dan vii Com∣pare this with chap ii wherein the same Prophet informs us that  in the days of these Kings  meaning the Kings or rather Kingdoms which suc∣ceeded the fourth great Kingdom or Roman Empire  shall the God of Hea∣ven set up a Kingdom which shall  NEVER BE DESTROYED  and the King∣dom shall not be left to other People  but  it shall break in pieces and con∣sume all these Kingdoms and IT SHALL STAND FOR EVER  The Psalmist had also previously declared  Thy Throne O  GOD  is  FOR EVER AND EVER  Psal xlv  Which the Apostle Paul has applied expressly to the Son Heb i These Prophecies of an  Eternal Kingdom  proclaimed by the Prophets under the Old Testament were confirmed by the Angel GABRIEL when he declared the Eternity of CHRIST'S Government  And behold  said he  to the Blessed Virgin  thou shalt con∣ceive in thy womb and bring forth a Son and shalt call his Name  JESUS  which signifies A SAVIOUR See note in p  He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest and  THE LORD GOD  shall give unto him  THE THRONE  of his Father David And he shall  REIGN  over the House of Jacob  FOR EVER    and of  HIS KINGDOM THERE SHALL BE NO END        Luke i  The Apostle Paul nevertheless informs us of a time  when he  Christ  shall have  DELIVERED UP THE KINGDOM TO GOD EVEN THE FATHER  when he shall have put down all Rule and all Authority and Power  meaning ALL POWER that in any degree is opposite or inimical in its Nature to his KINGDOM OF RIGHT∣EOUSNESS  For he must  REIGN  till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet  Cor xv And again in the th verse  And when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall  THE SON ALSO HIMSELF BE SUBJECT UNTO HIM THAT PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIM THAT GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL  The two last mentioned texts when collated with the preceding declara∣tions concerning  the Eternity of Christ's Kingdom  would contain an irreconcileable difficulty were it not clearly demon∣strable that  "the Son of God"  is really included with THE ALMIGHTY FA∣THER in the Eternal BEING JEHOVAH and consequently is truly GOD For the fact is that he is called JEHOVAH and GOD in many unquestionable passages of Scripture in some  expressly  in others by  necessary implication  several examples of which are already cited in this Tract and no inference to the contrary can be justly drawn from any of the texts which my learned friend before mentioned  has laid before me as proofs of an op∣posite sentiment  Most of these indeed are such as re∣late to  the Son  merely in his  mediatorial Office  as MESSIAH or  the Anointed of  JEHOVAHas Psal ii  The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his Anointed  Psal ii  And when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said Lord thou art God which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said Why did the hea∣then rage and the people imagine vain things The Kings of the earth stood up and the Rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ  Acts iv  But unto the Son  he saith  Thy throne O God  is  for ever and ever a Scepter of right∣eousness  is  the Scepter of thy Kingdom Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God  even  thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows  Heb i  The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine ene∣mies thy footstool  Psal cx  For he must reign  till he hath put all enemies under his feet  Cor xv  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give unto you the Spirit of wisdom and reve∣lation in the knowledge of him  c  which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set  him  at his own right hand in the heavenly  places  Eph i  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by  his  Son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds  Heb i  com∣pared with Acts iv also Heb i Psal cx Cor xv  which is the particular text now under consideration Eph i and Heb i And others relate particularly to Christ's ministry whilst he dwelt personally as  a Man  upon earthas Isai xi  And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the Spirit of wisdom and understanding the Spirit of counsel and might the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord  Isai xi  The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn  lxi  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised  Luke iv  lxi compared with Luke iv These prove indeed that  he is  inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood  and all of them demon∣strate his subordination to the Almighty Father in the ministry and gracious offices which he had undertaken for the restoration of mankind but none of them afford the least shadow of contra∣diction to the texts wherein his  Divine Nature  is declared One particular text however remains to be mentioned which at first sight seems to militate against my general argumentviz Psal lxxxiii  That  men  may know that thou  i e GOD mentioned in the st and th verses  WHOSE NAME ALONE IS JE∣HOVAH art  the most High over all the earth  Now it is strictly true indeed though I do not think it the proper translation of this text see pages that  God  ALONE  is  JE∣HOVAH because  Jehovah alone  is God  For who is God but Jehovah  Psa xviii  and the Scriptures assure us that there is but ONE JEHOVAH Deut  vi or  One  "ONLY WISE GOD" Rom xvi Tim i And therefore when  the Son of God  is called JEHOVAH or GOD he is not so named as being distinct or separate with respect to that ONE  Eternal Being  JEHOVAH or GOD but as being included in that  Divine Nature  or GOD  whose Name alone is  JEHOVAH  and as being ONE  with the  ALMIGHTY FATHER which was declared by the Son himself  I and the Father    WE ARE ONE  John x  I am in the Father and the Father in me  John xiv xvii and x  And therefore though  the Son  shall deliver up the kingdom to God even the Fa∣ther  and shall  also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all  as declared in the texts cited above from Cor xv yet as  the Son is in the Father and the Father in him  and  as  "all things that the Father hath are" the Son's  John xvi and as he must of course be  glorified with the Glory which he had with the Father himself before the world was  John xvii it is manifest that he will  still reign in and with the  ALMIGHTY FATHER in that Eternal Being of GOD which will then  "be all in all"  In the above mentioned text of St Paul it is said that  He  Christ  must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet  and that  the last enemy  that  shall be destroyed is  DEATH  Cor xv  This opens to us the time that Christ will deliver up the kingdom DEATH that last enemy will be effectually destroyed when all men that are redeemed by Christ are  risen from  DEATH The world itself where alone  Death  reigned and all that is desirable in it will then  not only be  "burned up"  Pet iii but will be made the seat of  eter∣nal Horror  and  "everlasting Fire"  see Notes in pages and and the irrevocable decrees of  the Son of  MAN in his final Judgment upon MEN and ANGELS will by that time have taken place Here then is an end of the whole Christian Dispensation What need can there be of a  Redeemer  a  Me∣diator  or of a  Judge  after the Fate of all Mankind is determinedIt is no lessening therefore of the Son's Dig∣nity that he then delivers up the several charges which he had undertaken in obedience to his Father's will when the same shall have been compleatly executed and fulfilledThe generality of Commentators agree that it is Christ's  Mediatorial Kingdom  which will then be delivered up but they should also have mentioned that  Sovereignty  which is still of higher degree that glorious  Sovereign Authority  which is of un∣speakable Dignity I mean that of sit∣ting as SUPREME JUDGE OF THE UNI∣VERSE An Authority of which even the  Almighty Father  hath divested him∣self  For the Father judgeth no Man but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son  and the  supreme Dignity  of the Trust is fully declared by the reason of its being given  that all  Men  should honour the Son even as they honour the Father  John v  Nay not only Men but Angels must  honour him  for the word ALL  includes  Angels  as well as  Men  and we read expressly that  Angels  are required to WORSHIP HIM  And again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith  says the Apostle to the Hebrews  And let  ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM  Heb i Compare with the Greek version of Psalm xcvii  which would be gross idolatry if Christ was not truly GOD and  One with the Father  in the  Eternal Being JEHOVAH And when the important Trust shall have been fulfilled and compleatly executed that  Divine  Authority and Jurisdiction as  supreme Judge  which had been com∣mitted only to  One  of the Divine Per∣sons shall be delivered up together with all other offices of  distinct  or  separate  Au∣thority that  GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL  And  in  GOD undoubtedly  the Son of God  shall reign over the House of Jacob for ever and of his Kingdom there shall be no end  Agreeable to the Angels Prophecy Luke i  The Scriptures indeed are every where filled with clear Testimonies concerning  the Divinity  of our BLESSED REDEEM∣ER so that the command to  honour  him  "even as we honour the Father"  is per∣fectly consistent with all the rest And therefore unless we HONOUR the Son with SUPREME HONOUR  even as we honour the Father  we fall short  of the command and for want of  due Faith  cannot expect to obtain of the Father that  glorious  and  heavenly Gift  for the necessary improvement of  Human Nature  which our REDEEMER has pro∣mised  to them that ask in his Name even the Spirit of Truth  John xv  which  will guide us into all Truth  John xvi  The supreme or equal  Divine Nature  of THE HOLY SPIRIT is not less clearly declared in several parts of Scripture than the  Divine Nature  of THE SON OF GOD notwithstanding that some other parts of Scripture express a manifest  Subordination of Office  as that  he shall  NOT SPEAK OF HIMSELF  but what∣soever he "  SHALL HEAR that  shall he speak  John xvi Upon this Augustine has remarked that  AUDIRE  illi  SCIRE  est  SCIRE  verò  ESSE  Ab illo  à quo precedit illi est  ESSENTIA SCIENTIA  et  AUDIEN∣TIA  Semper  AUDIT  Spiritus Sanctus quia semper scit  Tract  But the true sense of this  Hearing  and  Speaking  of the Holy Ghost will be best understood by comparing the text with another passage of Scripture wherein  God's Revelation by his Spirit  is further explained St Paul speaking of  the things which God hath prepared for them that love him  intimates that  GOD  hath  RE∣VEALED them  unto us  BY HIS SPIRIT  for the Spirit  says he  searcheth all things yea  THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD  For what Man" continues the Apostle "knoweth the things of a Man save  THE SPI∣RIT OF MAN  which is in him Even so"    so also  "the things of  GOD  knoweth no Man but  THE SPI∣RIT OF GOD  Cor ii  Thus by  com∣paring spiritual things with spiritual  agreeable to the Apostle's advice in the next verse but one ver we learn how to understand what is said of the Holy Ghost's  Hearing  what  "he shall speak"  for the manner of his  knowing  or being acquainted with  "the things of God"  we find is plainly compared to the knowledge of the Soul  in a Man  respecting  the things of a Man  and surely a stronger declaration of supreme and infinite Knowledge could not have been made He therefore that  searcheth  the deep things of God  speaks not of himself  because he speaks  "the things of God"  and of course  the things of Christ  because  "all things that the Father hath"  said Christ  "are  MINE  therefore said I"  continues our Lord  that he  i e the Spirit  shall take of  MINE  and shall shew it unto you  John xvi  "  and that he is sent  or given  by the Father  Our Lord said to his disciples  I will pray  THE FATHER  and  HE  shall  GIVE  you another  COM∣FORTER  that he may abide with you for ever  even  the  SPIRIT OF TRUTH  c  John xiv    But the Comforter  which is  the Holy Ghost whom  THE FATHER WILL SEND  in my Name he shall teach you all things c  Ch xiv  and also  by the Son    It is expedient for you  said our Lord to his disciples  that I go away for if I go not away  THE COMFORTER  will not come unto you but if I depart  I WILL SEND HIM  unto you  John xvi  Compare this with ch xv  When  THE COMFORTER  is come whom  I WILL SEND  unto you from the Father even  THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH  which proceedeth      proceedeth out    from the Father he shall testify of me  This text affords an ample proof of  the Divine Nature  of the HOLY SPIRIT and shews that he is not like other Spirits  a created Spirit  but on the contrary  proceeded out from the Father  as Grotius remarks  Non creatus aliquis Spiritus sed qui de patris ipsius substantia procedit et ab ipso emanat  ut Athenagoras loquitur  The Divine Word in like manner  proceeded out from the Father  as I have already remarked see p  and again that he is declared to be  "the Spirit of Christ"  Of which salvation    meaning  "the salva∣tion of souls"  mentioned in the preceding verse    the Prophets have enquired and searched diligently who pro∣phesied of the Grace  that should come  unto you search∣ing what or what manner of time  THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST  which was  IN THEM  did signify when it  testified beforehand the sufferings  OF CHRIST  and the glory that should follow  Pet i  From hence it is manifest that this  Spirit of Christ  is the same iden∣tical  Spirit of God    THE SPIRIT OF JEHO∣VAH which spake  beforehand the sufferings of Christ by the Prophets  in old time so that  the Spirit of God  is unquestionably  the Spirit  also  of Christ  agreeably to what our Lord himself declared  All things that  THE FATHER  hath are  MINE  see page  and therefore the  Almighty  Operations of  the Holy Spirit  manifested the Glory of the  Son  as well as the Glory of the  Father    He  said our Lord speaking of THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH  shall glorify me for he shall receive of  MINE  and shall shew it unto you All things that  THE FATHER  hath  ARE MINE  therefore said I that he shall take of  MINE  and shew  it  unto you  John xvi  Compare this with John xvii  And all mine are thine  said Christ to his Heavenly Father  and thine are mine and I  AM GLORIFIED IN THEM  as well as  "the Spirit of God"  yet I say notwithstanding these ex∣pressions of  Subordination  the supreme or equal  Divine Nature  of THE HOLY SPIRIT is clearly revealed in several parts of Scripture The Prophet Isaiah for instance has declared the Divine Omnipotence of  the Spirit  in the strong∣est termsin terms which prove that  "the Spirit of God"  is a free and inde∣pendent Spirit and is truly  God  of the  same  supreme Divine Nature  or  Eternal Being  with the other  Two Divine Per∣sons  for this Prophet expressly applies to  "the Spirit of God"  the same supreme Attributes of  Creation  and  Almighty Power  which in other parts of Scrip∣ture are occasionally attributed to the other Two Divine Persons  But hear the words of the Prophet himself dictated by  that same Spirit    Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out hea∣ven with the span and comprehended the dust in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a ba∣lance Who hath directed  THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD  or rather the SPI∣RIT OF JEHOVAH  for thus exactly is  the Spirit  of the Lord com∣monly expressed in the Old Testament when mention is made of his inspiration or coming down upon the Prophets  or who being his Counsellor hath taught him With whom took he counsel  and  who  instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding  Thus the Prophet clearly insists on the indepen∣dency of the  free  Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is  LIBERTY  Cor iii    Take not thy  HOLY SPIRIT  from me Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy  FREE SPIRIT  Psa li  Spirit of the Lord    Behold the nations  are  as as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing And Libanon  is  not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burntoffering All nations before him  are  as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity  Isaiah xl  The Prophet af∣terwards proceeds to speak of GOD  without further distinction of Persons having already in the preceding part of the chapter clearly distinguished the Person of the Son of God under the title  of  "Jehovah"  and  "our God"  whose Advent was to be proclaimed by the voice in the wilderness and of whom  Sion  and  Jerusalem  were directed to say unto the cities of Judah  Behold your God  see p  and having also expressly distinguished  the Spirit of Jehovah  and proclaimed his  Di∣vine Attributes  and  supreme Dignity  see ver last cited he now proceeds to speak of GOD in the th verse without further distinction of Persons  To whom then  continues he  will ye liken  GOD  or what likeness will ye compare unto him  ver c  The Spiritual Nature of GOD is surely so far above our finite comprehension that it cannot be explained or expressed by any likeness or comparison whatso∣everBut yet as we may clearly per∣ceive and understand by what is revealed to us that the supreme Attributes of  Creation  and  Almighty Power  are applied  expressly to  the Holy Spirit  as in the above cited text of Isaiah which in other parts of Scripture are equally attri∣buted to THE FATHER AND THE SON we may reasonably conclude that the  supreme Dignity  of the HOLY SPIRIT must necessarily consist in his entire  Union  and  Equality  with  the Father  and with  the Son  in the  Divine Nature  or GODHEAD  See note in p and note in p  that ONE eternal and glo∣rious  Being  JEHOVAH  which is and which was and which is to come  THE ALMIGHTY  Rev i see also p  This entire  Union  of THE HOLY SPI∣RIT with the Almighty Father and the Son in the  One  Eternal Being of GOD is a necessary doctrine without which THE ALMIGHTY POWER attributed in the Scriptures to  the Holy Spirit  cannot be reconciled to that other indispensable Article of our Faith  the Unity of God  In the Book of Job ch xxxiii  the Spirit  is declared to be the  Creator  THE SPIRIT OF GOD  The words here rendered  "the Spirit of God"  are  which are both Noun Substantives and therefore ought not to be construed  the Divine Spirit  as in the Greek version  c but  the Spirit of God  as it is rendered in the Chaldee Para∣phrase or Targum  and also in the Syriac version  for in both these the Ar∣ticle of the Genitive Case is added to the second Substan∣tive to mark the  sense  of the Hebrew in such cases though that most ancient language has no Article to ex∣press the Genitive Case  hath  MADE  me and  THE BREATH  a term synonymous to SPIRIT  of the Almighty hath given me Life  In the account also which Moses has given us of  the Creation  we read that  the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters  Gen i  And the Psalmist attributes  the Creation  to THE SPIRIT jointly with the Divine WORD  By the  WORD  of  JEHOVAH  were the heavens made and all the host of  them by the  BREATH or SPIRIT  Or SPIRITfor the word here rendered  Breath  is  i e the very same Hebrew Noun by which the  Spirit  is most commonly expressed in Holy Scripture  of his mouth  Psal xxxiii  And afterwards when the Divine WORD  was made flesh and dwelt among us  he himself expressly attributed to  the Spirit of God  Attributed to  "the Spirit of God"  Our Lord said to the Jews  If I cast out Devils  BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD  then the Kingdom of  GOD  is come unto you  Matth xii  those mighty WORKS to which he appealed for the truth of his doctrine concerning his  Unity  with the  Almighty Father  see p and which at another time he expressly calls the  Works of his Father  If I do not the works of my Father believe me not  John x  So that without the doctrine of  the Unity of the Divine Nature  this ap∣plication of  the same  Attributes to  dif∣ferent  Persons could not be understood  St Paul also attributed to  THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD  I have therefore whereof I may glory  THROUGH JESUS CHRIST  in those things which pertain unto God For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which  CHRIST HATH NOT WROUGHT BY ME  to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed through  MIGHTY SIGNS AND WONDERS BY THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD  so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ  Rom xv  the miracles which he wrought  "through Jesus Christ"  in preaching his Gospel to the Gentiles Nay even the miraculous Conception of the Blessed Virgin from whence the Holy Child  Jesus  was called  "the Son of God"  is expressly attributed to the  Holy Ghost  by St Matthew  She was found with Child of the Holy Ghost  i  for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost  i  Compare this with Luke i  The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee  c  The glorious Title    the Power of the Highest  which imme∣diately follows these words concerning  the Holy Ghost  in the last mentioned text is by several learned Commentators at∣tributed also to him viz  the Holy Spirit  "  Et Virtus Altissimi  i e Spiritus Dei qui  Virtus Dei  Luc xxiv efficacissimus" Lucas Bru∣gensis as quoted in Pole's Synopsis And Grotius on the th verse of this chapter says  Quoties  nominatur  SPIRITU  nominato vis quaedam  SPIRITUS  solita major indicatur ut infra  meaning the th verse the text in question  Actor x Cor ii Thess i  and a Title nearly similar is certainly attributed to the  same Spirit  even by our Lord himself when he fore∣told the fulfilling of God's promise in the Gift of the Holy Ghost  And behold said he I send the promise of my Father  Compare with John xiv  upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with  POWER FROM ON HIGH  Luke xxiv  Similar Titles are also given to the Son of God for even in his ministerial Cha∣racter as  Messiah  or  Christ  after he had taken  Human Nature  upon him he is called  THE POWER OF GOD AND THE WISDOM OF GOD  Cor i  Surely these are Attributes of  the Divine Nature  and Titles of  supreme Dignity  The Power of  Justification  must cer∣tainly be also accounted a  Divine Attri∣bute  and as such can belong to none but GOD  for it is  GOD  that  JUSTI∣FIETH  Rom viii  but yet both  Justification  and  Sanctification  also another  Divine Attribute  are expressly attributed to the HOLY SPIRIT jointly with CHRIST  But ye are washed but ye are  SANCTIFIED  but ye are  JUSTIFIED  in the Name of the  LORD JESUS  and by  or  in  THE SPIRIT  of our God  Cor vi  To give  Life  also is not less apparently an Attribute of THE DIVINE NATURE than  Creation  whether we speak of mere  Animal Life  or the  Spiritual  or  Eternal Life  but more especially the latter and yet this ALMIGHTY POWER is attributed both to  the Son  and to the  Holy Spirit  For though it is  GOD  who quickeneth the dead  Rom iv  and  who quickeneth all things  Tim vi  yet  the Son  also is called  a quick∣ening Spirit  Cor xv  and quickeneth whom he will    John v  and by the same authority we know likewise that  it is  THE SPIRIT  that  QUICKENETH  John vi  In consequence of this Al∣mighty Power  the Son  is called  THE PRINCE or Author OF LIFE  And killed the  PRINCE or Author OF LIFE    whom  GOD  hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses  Acts iii  See also a note in p    and  the Spirit  is expressly intituled  the Spirit of  LIFE  There is  therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after  THE SPIRIT  For the Law of  THE SPIRIT OF LIFE  in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the Law of sin and death  Rom viii    And after three days and an half  THE SPIRIT OF LIFE  from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet c  Rev xi    Add to this that  the Spirit  is expressly intituled  the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding the Spirit of Counsel and Might  And  THE SPIRIT OF JEHOVAH  shall rest upon him  viz upon the Branch from the Stem of Jesse  the Spirit of wisdom and understanding the Spirit of counsel and might the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord c  Isai xi  the Spirit of Holi∣liness  And declared to be  THE SON OF GOD  with  POWER  according to  THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS  by the resurrection from the dead  Rom i  and  THE SPIRIT OF GLORY  For  THE SPIRIT OF GLORY  and of God resteth upon you  Pet iv  These expressions of  Dignity and Power are  unlimited  and do certainly include the highest or  supreme  degree of the several recited Attributes even the infinite  Wisdom Understanding Counsel  c of GOD because they are attributed to that glorious  Spirit  which  searcheth all things yea the deep things of God  Cor ii  and they are attributed to him also as  essential  Properties which are so eminently  his  that he is even named from them  the Spirit of Wisdom    the Spirit of Might    the Spirit of Glory  as Christ is also intituled  the Power of God and the Wisdom of God  see p  and  "the Lord of Glory"  see pages  These Titles and Attributes cannot in that eminent and  essential  degree in which they are attributed both to  the Son  and  Holy Spirit  belong to any Being that is not  truly God  and  Jehovah  and it is clearly revealed to us that there is  but  One Jehovah  Hear O Israel the Lord  or Jehovah  our God is  ONE JEHOVAH  Deut vi  as I have before remarked in pages who is the  only true God the God of Israel  When GOD delivered the Law to his people  Israel  he said  I am  JEHOVAH THY GOD  which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other Gods before me  Exod xx  and yet we learn by the Scriptures not only that CHRIST is truly GOD and JEHOVAH of which I have already produced many authentic proofs from Scripture in pages but that THE HOLY GHOST is also JEHOVAH and consequently is included likewise in the Unity      of the Deity  or  Godhead  This is a scriptural expression for  the Nature of God  for we read in Col ii that  in him  i e in Christ  dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead      of the Deity or Divine Nature    bodily  Nearly the same word but in the Nominative Case viz  is also used in Rom i Another expression for the  Di∣vine  Nature  or  Deity  we read in Acts xvii viz  That there is but  One Divine Nature  is a necessary doctrine because there is but  One God  and though it is difficult for our finite understandings to comprehend how  Three Divine Persons  are included in that  One God  yet these scriptural expressions for  the Divine Nature    and  afford great relief to our conceptions of that necessary doctrine for there is no difficulty in comprehending that  Three Divine Persons  may be united  in One Divine Nature  or  And hence also it is a necessary doctrine that  the Son  and not less  the Spirit  likewise is  equal to the Father as touching the Godhead  though inferior and subor∣dinate in some other respects because it would be absurd to contend for  the Unity of the Divine Nature  if the least degree of  Inequality  respecting that  Nature  or  Existence  be admitted See pages  of the Deity  or  Godhead  The Holy Ghost is  Jehovah  because it is he who  "limiteth a certain day"  saying in David Today after so long a time  see St Paul's Commentary on the th Psalm  as it is said To∣day if ye will hear  HIS VOICE  the Holy Ghost refers them to THE VOICE of another Person who appears by the Apostle's argument to be the Messiah  harden not your hearts  Heb iv  In the preceding chapter the Apostle  tells us expressly that it was  the Holy Ghost  who said these words  Where∣fore  says he  as the  HOLY GHOST SAITH    Today if ye will hear  HIS VOICE  harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your Fathers tempted  ME  saith the Holy Ghost  proved  ME  and saw MY WORKS forty years  But in the several accounts which Moses has given us of these glo∣rious  Works  and Transactions we find them mentioned as the  Works  of  Jeho∣vah  and by St Paul they seem to be attributed to  Christ  For they drank of that spiritual Rock that fol∣lowed them and that Rock was Christ  Cor x  And again in the th verse  Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of ser∣pents  and therefore if the  Holy Ghost  was a mere ministering  Spirit  employed only as an agent in  Jehovah  's Works with  Jehovah  's Power and was not also truly  Jehovah  himself he  the Spirit of Truth  could not have  called them  his Works    Wherefore I was grieved  continues  the Holy Ghost  still speaking in David  with that generation and said They do alway err in  their  heart and they have not known  MY  ways So I sware in  MY wrath they shall not enter into  MY rest  Heb iii  Surely these are expressions of  supreme  Authority which could not be used by any  Spirit  that was not truly  Jehovah  Again in the th chapter of the same Epistle th verse we read  c  THE HOLY GHOST  also is a witness to us for after that  HE  had said before  This is the covenant that I  WILL MAKE  with them  c The text to which the Apostle apparently refers us is in Jeremiah xxxi where  we find that it was  Jehovah  who said these words by the Prophet  See also the two verses preceding  Be∣hold the days come  SAITH JEHOVAH  that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel c  Jer xxxi  And afterwards in the d verse the text quoted by St Paul as words  said by  THE HOLY GHOST the Pro∣phet adds in the Name of JEHOVAH  But this  shall be  the covenant that I  WILL MAKE  with the House of Israel after those days  SAITH JEHOVAH  I will put  MY  Law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be  THEIR GOD  and they shall be my people  This text is expressly attributed to the  Holy Ghost  by the Apostle and the next verse is joined by the Copulative  and  as the words of the same Divine Speaker  AND  they shall teach no more every man his neigh∣bour  and every man his brother saying  KNOW JEHOVAH  for they shall all  KNOW ME  saith THE HOLY GHOST this being a regular continuance as I before remarked of the words attributed to him by the Apostle  from the least of them unto the greatest of them  SAITH JEHOVAH  for I will forgive their iniquity  and none but God can for∣give sins  See a note in p marked †    and I will remember their sin no more  Jer xxxi  This Promise is apparently to the same effect as that which JEHOVAH had be∣fore proclaimed by his Prophet Isaiah viz  And all thy children  shall be TAUGHT OF JEHOVAH  Isai liv  To these texts therefore our Lord probably referred when he said to the Jews  'It is written in the Prophets'  And they shall be  ALL TAUGHT OF GOD  Every man therefore that hath  HEARD  and hath  LEARNED OF THE FATHER  cometh unto me  John vi  Thus the being  taught of God  is manifestly esteemed by our Lord to be the same thing as  hearing and learning of the Father  for he mentions these cir∣cumstances apparently to illustrate what he had before said in the preceding verse concerning the Father's  drawing  the true Believers  No man  said our Lord  can come unto me unless  THE FATHER  which hath sent me  DRAW  him  John vi  so that Christ's reference to what was  written in the Prophets  on this subject especially as he applies these Prophecies to the  Drawing  and  Teaching of the Father  seems at first sight to make against my argument which was to shew that the Prophecies here cited were the  Words of  THE HOLY GHOST speaking in the Prophets under the Title of  Jehovah  But this is so far from being a real ob∣jection  that it is truly a confirmation of the former argument concerning  the speaking of  THE HOLY GHOST when we consider that  the Drawing of the Father  and the  Teaching of God  is effected only  by the Spirit of God  For the same Apostle John who recorded our Lord's reference to the Prophets last cited tells us in his First General Epistle ii how this  Teaching of God  is communicated    And ye have  AN UNCTION  from the Holy One  "From the Holy One"    That is    says Dr Whitby    From JESUS CHRIST  emphatically so called  Acts iii Apoc iii  But then that  UNCTION says he  is the  HOLY SPIRIT  which he hath given to them that believe For he being  ANOINTED WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE HIS FELLOWS  Psa xlv  ANOINTED BY GOD WITH THE HOLY GHOST  Acts x  This Grace  says the Dr  is given to Christians  ACCORDING TO THE MEA∣SURE OF THE GIFT OF CHRIST  Eph iv  And we all beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same likeness as by the Spirit of the Lord  Cor iii Vol p  and ye  KNOW  all things  John ii This  Unction  or  Anoint∣ing  is generally understood by Com∣mentators to signify the Influence of  the Holy Spirit  By the  UNCTION  here and the  ANOINTING ver is meant the HOLY SPIRIT whose Gifts and Graces are diffused throughout the whole Church and to every living Member thereof  Rev Francis Fox M A See his New Test with references printed in p    Thereby are signified the gifts of THE HOLY GHOST bestowed on Believers whereby they are consecrated to God  Psa xlv Heb i Assem∣bly's Annotations    In Novo Testamento ubi omnes sunt Reges et Sacerdotes per UNGUENTUM intelli∣gitur QU  E VIS DEI GRATIA ut diximus Hebr i et Iac v EXIMIè verò ILLA per quam SPIRI∣TUS nobis in singulis circumstantiis suggerit et Christi praecepta et monita quae cuique tempori sunt idonea  Joh xiv Grotius  See also the opinion of Dr Whitby in the preceding note But the Scriptures them∣selves teach us plainly that the Inspiration of  the Holy Spirit  is to be understood by the  Unction  or  Anointing    THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD JEHOVAH  is upon me  because JEHOVAH  hath  ANOINTED  me  c  Isaiah lxi Compare with Acts x    How God  ANOINT∣ED  Jesus of Nazareth with  THE HOLY SPIRIT  and with Power  See also note in p  and the Effect of that Influence is further explained in the th verse of the same chapter  But  THE ANOINTING  which ye have re∣ceived  of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man  TEACH  you but as the same  ANOINTING TEACHETH  you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath  TAUGHT  you ye shall abide in him  John ii  And it is manifest that this  "Anointing which teacheth all things"  is to be understood of THE HOLY SPI∣RIT for the Apostle Paul informs us that the Communication of this  Know∣ledge  or  Teaching  from God is by  the Holy Spirit    Eye  says he  hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which  GOD  hath prepared for them that love him But  GOD HATH REVEALED them UNTO US BY HIS SPIRIT  for  THE SPIRIT  searcheth  ALL THINGS  yea  THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD  For what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him Even so  THE THINGS  OF GOD  knoweth no man but  THE SPIRIT OF GOD  Now we have re∣ceived not the spirit of the world but  THE SPIRIT WHICH IS OF GOD  or rather THE SPIRIT OUT OF GOD  that is which  pro∣ceedeth forth    see John xv  "out of God"  see note in p  that we might  KNOW  the things that are freely given to us of  GOD  where∣by it is manifest that we obtain  this Knowledge of the things of God  by the Holy Spirit  Which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which  THE HOLY GHOST TEACHETH  This  Teaching of the Holy Ghost  is also fully de∣clared by our Lord's promise of that Heavenly Gift to his disciples  But the Comforter  which is THE HOLY GHOST  saith our Lord  whom the Father will send in my Name  HE SHALL TEACH YOU ALL THINGS c  John xiv  And again  When he  THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH  is come he will guide you  INTO ALL TRUTH  c  John xvi  comparing spiritual things with spiritual  But  THE NA∣TURAL    or Animal MAN  re∣ceiveth not the things of  THE SPIRIT OF GOD  How urgent and importunate ought we therefore to be in claiming on all occasions the gracious Promises of  Spiritual Assistance  see p as  the Nature of Man  is declared to be thus miserably deficient without that Hea∣venly Gift the neglect of which is the first foundation of Infidelity and Scep∣ticism  for they are foolishness unto him  even  the things of infinite Wis∣dom  for such must be  the things of the Spirit of God  are  foolishness  to the mere  Natural  Man  neither can he know  them  because they are  SPI∣RITUALLY  discerned But he that is  SPIRITUAL  judgeth all things c  Cor ii  The glorious Effect of  Christ's Pro∣mises  upon those who duly claim them is principally as I have before remark∣ed  see p that we shall  "partake of the Divine Nature"  But how can that Effect take place if  the Spirit of God and of Christ  But ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that  THE SPIRIT OF GOD  dwell in you Now if any man have not  THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST  he is none of his And if  CHRIST be IN YOU  i e in  you by his Spirit  mentioned in the preceding sentence  the body  is  dead because of sin but the Spirit  is  life because of righteousness But if  THE SPIRIT OF HIM  that raised up  JESUS  from the dead  DWELL IN YOU  he that raised up  CHRIST  from the dead shall also quicken your mortal mortal bodies  BY HIS SPIRIT  that  DWELLETH  in you  Rom viii  Here we find  "the Spirit of God"  and  "the Spirit of Christ"  distinctly mentioned in the same context though the  spiritual Effects  of both are undoubtedly the same because both these titles belong to one and the same  Holy Spirit  as St Paul elsewhere declares  "For through him"  says the Apostle speaking of the reconciliation or uniting of the Gentiles and the commonwealth of Israel through Christ  we both  i e Jews and Gentiles  have access  BY ONE SPIRIT  unto the Father  Eph ii  This  One Spirit  therefore must necessarily be understood not only when  "the Spirit of God"  is mentioned but also when∣ever we read of "  the Spirit of the Son  Because ye are Sons  GOD  hath sent forth  THE SPIRIT OF HIS SON  into your hearts  Gal iv  "  the Spirit  of Jesus  I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of  THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST  Phil i    or  the Spirit of Christ  see note in p  for as Christians are  builded together for  AN HABITATION OF GOD THROUGH THE SPIRIT  Eph ii  so likewise it must be THROUGH THE SAME SPIRIT that they become  AN HABITATION OF CHRIST    if Christ be in you  c because the same text informs us that  if any man have not the  SPIRIT OF CHRIST  he is none of his  see page  the Spirit of the Father and  of the Son  by which alone we can have communication with either  Compare the preceding note in page with the note in p See also page  is not  really Divine  We are taught by a mul∣titude of texts throughout the New Testament that MAN  by Nature  is ca∣pable of receiving THE HOLY SPIRIT  within him  so that the  Human Body  is expressly called in Scripture  the Tem∣ple of the Holy Ghost  What know ye not that your  BODY  is  THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST which is  in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own  Cor vi    and therefore if THE HOLY GHOST were not really and truly GOD of the same  Divine Nature  with THE FATHER for there can be but ONE  Divine Nature  as there is but ONE GOD which I hope is already clearly demonstrated see pages how improper would be the idea of comparing  Man  to  a Temple  For Christians are not only called  the Temple of God  Cor vi  And what agreement  says the Apostle Paul  hath  THE TEMPLE OF GOD  with idols for ye are  THE TEMPLE OF THE LIVING GOD  as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in  them  and will be their God and they shall be my people  And this  Indwelling  or  Inhabitation of God  in the Faithful is declared in Scripture to be  "through the Spirit"  which affords an ample proof that  the Spirit  is truly GOD  In whom  says St Paul to the Ephesians ii speaking of  Jesus Christ    ye also are builded together for  AN HA∣BITATION OF GOD THROUGH THE SPIRIT  Thus the true Christian doth really become a TEMPLE OF GOD "for  where God dwells is a Temple"  as Grotius remarks  Templum est ubi  DEUS  habitat In piis habitat Deus  PER SPI∣RITUM SANCTUM  Sunt igitur  TEMPLUM DEI  Grot Annot Tom IV p  and GOD  dwells is good men  BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT "  Therefore  says he  are they  THE TEMPLE OF GOD"  This  Inhabitation  or  Indwelling  of the HOLY SPIRIT  in the Temple of  GOD is plainly declared by the Apostle Paul in another text  "Know ye not"  says he  that ye are  THE TEMPLE OF GOD  and that  THE SPIRIT OF GOD DWELLETH IN YOU  If any man defile  THE TEMPLE OF GOD  him shall God destroy for  THE TEMPLE OF GOD  is holy  "is holy"  "  being sanctified by  THE HOLY GHOST" Rom xv    which  Temple  ye are  Cor iii  but expressly as I have already remarked  the Tem∣ple  of the Holy Ghost  as if the terms were synonymous  Too many  Temples  indeed through the Depravity of  Mankind  and the In∣fluence of  Devils  have been dedicated to those "  which by Nature are  NO GODS" But that was only amongst men  "who knew not God"  Gal iv But shall we conceive of the inspired Writers of the New Testament that they would also DEDICATE  Temples  to a Being  "which by Nature is no God"  For if we could suppose it true that THE HOLY SPIRIT  by Nature is no  GOD  the TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST would be no better in that one  respect than  Heathen  Temples And therefore if we really believe the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God we must necessarily believe that THE HOLY GHOST is really and truly GOD for otherwise we should not have been re∣quired by the Holy Scriptures to esteem our  Bodies  as the  Temple of the Holy Ghost  And as it thus appears to be a necessary conclusion that THE HOLY GHOST is  truly  GOD it is equally a necessary doctrine that he is also JE∣HOVAH "  For who is  GOD" i e truly God "  except  JEHOVAH"  Compare this with Ps lxxxvi  Thou art God alone  that is  Thou  JEHOVAH  art God alone  for the whole Psalm is a prayer addressed to JEHOVAH "  Bow down thine ear  O JEHOVAH" cSee also Isaiah xxxvii and compare th  se texts with the note in p concerning those persons whose title of  "Gods"  was merely  nominal  Psa xviii And therefore though THE HOLY GHOST is clearly revealed to us in Scrip∣ture as a distinct Person from THE FA∣THER  and THE SON he must neverthe∣less be included in that One Divine and Eternal  Being  JEHOVAH and according∣ly in that supreme character he revealed the Divine Will to the Prophets Of this I have already produced some remarkable and I trust incontrovertible proofs and therefore shall only request my reader's attention to one more example of it  Well spake  THE HOLY GHOST  said the Apostle Paul to the unbelieving Jews at Rome  by Isaias the Prophet unto our Fathers saying Go unto this people and say Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive For the heart of this people is waxed gross c  Acts xxviii  But when we turn to that part of Isaiah's Prophecy to which the Apostle refers us as the SAYING of THE HOLY GHOST we find it was JEHOVAH which  spoke  to the Prophet  I heard  says the Prophet  the  VOICE  of the  LORD  Adonai  saying Whom shall I  SEND  and who will go for US  speaking expressly in a Plurality of Persons  Then said I here  am  I send me And  HE  said Go and tell this people Hear ye indeed  or in hearing  but under∣stand not and see ye indeed  or in see∣ing  but perceive not Make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed  See some Observations on this passage in my Tract on several important Prophecies d Edit pages and  Then said I  LORD or Adoni  how long And  HE  answered Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate c  Isai vi  Now the  Lord  or  Adoni  who then spake to Isaiah was represented to the  Prophet see the beginning of the chap∣ter as  sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple  c  and one cried unto another  that is the Seraphims mentioned in the pre∣ceding verse  HOLY HOLY HOLY IS JEHOVAH OF HOSTS  the whole earth is full of his glory c  ibid  Now notwithstanding that  the Lord  JEHOVAH is represented in this Divine Revelation as speaking in the  Plural  Number  "who will go for us"  and that the  threefold  repetition of the Epi∣thet  Holy  in the proclamation of God's glorious Title  Jehovah of Hosts  seems to correspond with the abovementioned Idea of a Plurality of Persons being comprehended in that  One Eternal Being  JEHOVAH which then revealed himself to Isaiah yet the Apostle Paul expressly attributed the Revelation to the  Holy  Ghost  as being the Divine Person which then spake  Well  SPAKE THE HOLY GHOST  says he  by Isaias the Prophet  SAYING  Go unto this people and say Hearing ye shall hear  c Who then shall presume to say that THE HOLY GHOST is not really and truly GOD when it is apparent by the cita∣tions already made that the glorious Name JEHOVAH which includes THE DIVINE NATURE OF THE FATHER and OF THE SON is expressly attributed also to THE HOLY GHOST  Without a due sense of this supreme Dignity of the  Holy Spirit  we should form but a very unworthy idea of the  real Dignity  of HUMAN NATURE which as I have already shewn is not only capable of  receiving  the Gift or internal Communication of that  glorious  and  eternal  FREE SPIRIT  See note in p  OF GOD  as  a Principle of Action  but is absolutely entitled even  to claim  that wonderful par∣ticipation of the  Divine Nature  to  claim  it I say by a written Charter of Privileges which can never be taken from us as  God's Word  cannot fail he having bound him∣self to us on certain reciprocal condi∣tions by an irrevocable covenant as sure as his Word that MAN might be FREE indeed We are FREE I say having now a  free Choice  through Christ to partake  if we will  "If we will"  For notwithstanding all that has been said and wrote concerning  Predestination  and  Reprobation  yet it must surely be our own fault a de∣pravity in our own  choice  or  will  if we partake not of  "the Tree of Life"  No man  indeed  can come to me  said that Di∣vine Person who alone is THE WAY  and  THE TRUTH  and  THE LIFE" John xiv    except the Father which hath sent me  DRAW  him and I  said he  will raise him up at the last day  John vi  But though  this Drawing  depends on  the Will of the Father  yet no just argument arises from thence against  the free Will of  MAN because we have ample assurance on the  part of the Almighty that his  Good Will  to DRAW us will not be wanting if we seek him as we ought and do not resist his Divine Grace in our hearts of this  Good Will  his affectionate remonstrances from time to time by his Prophets bear unquestionable testimony  Why  WILL  ye die O House of Israel For I  HAVE NO PLEASURE  in the death of him that dieth saith the  LORD JEHOVAH  wherefore turn yourselves    in Hiphil cause ye to turn i e the repentance must be by your own will and deed  "and live ye"  Ezek xviii And again GOD  swears by himself  that we may have full assurance of  his Will  in our favour if our own  Will  is not wanting  Say unto them  as I LIVE  saith the  LORD JEHOVAH  I have  NO PLEASURE  in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die O House of Israel  Ezek xxxiii  These texts indeed are assurances of God's love to  the House of Israel  but in Christ even  the Gentiles  are entitled to claim them being now engrafted on the stock of  Israel  see p and are thereby rendered  Abra∣ham's seed and heirs according to the promise  Gal iii  And under the New Covenant also God hath confirmed these assurances of favour  on his part  if we are not wanting to  ourselves  promising us that we shall  re∣ceive  if we will but  ask  see note in p  For  THE LORD  is not slack concerning his promise as some  men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward  NOT WILLING THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH BUT  that  ALL  should come to repentance  Pet iii  From hence it follows that if any perish it is not by God's  Will  though he certainly foreknows their destruction but by their own  wilful  Abuse of the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  for we are assured also by another Apostle that GOD  will have  ALL MEN  to be saved and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth  Tim ii  The Word  ALL  says the learned Mr Francis Fox on this text  here stands for  EVERY MAN for so it is used ver where we are commanded to pray for ALL MEN Hence says he we may argue that if God WILLS the Salvation of ALL MEN and would have ALL come to the acknowledgment of the Truth then he affords ALL sufficient MEANS and GRACE in order to their obtaining Salvation because without this they cannot be saved  See John vi quoted in the beginning of this note    If any therefore perish it is not because God DENIES them GRACE and HELP but because they are WANTING TO THEMSELVES and WILL NOT BE PREVAILED WITH to USE the assistance he affords Their destruction therefore is not FROM any peremptory DECREE of God's but FROM THEM∣SELVES  New Testament with references p note  of the  Tree of Life  see note in p from which our  first Parents were unhappily excluded in this world  But these glorious Privileges being granted to  Human Nature  only through the Merits of that  "Son of Man"  who voluntarily took  our Nature  upon him we must always remember that our  Title to the Benefits of the free Cove∣nant beforementioned is valid only when claimed  in his Name  and for  his Sake  as we ourselves are otherwise to∣tally unworthy of them for he alone is  "the Way and the Truth and the Life"  and  no Man cometh unto the Father but by him  John xiv  He hath therefore particularly in∣structed us how to  claim  the Privileges of  Human Nature  assuring us by  reiter∣ated  And I say unto you  said our Lord Jesus  ASK  and it shall be  GIVEN  you seek and ye shall find  KNOCK  and it shall be  OPENED  unto you  For our Lord had just before given a parable of a man's going to his friend's house even at midnight and  knocking  at the door to borrow bread  For every one that  ASKETH RECEIVETH  and he that  SEEKETH FINDETH  and to him that  KNOCKETH  it shall  BE OPENED  If  A SON  shall ask bread of any of you that is  A FATHER  will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will  he offer him a scorpion  IF YE THEN BEING EVIL  know how to give good Gifts unto  YOUR CHILDREN  how much more shall your  HEAVENLY FATHER  give the  HOLY SPIRIT  to them that  ASK  him  Luke xi  "  And whatsoever ye shall  ASK  in  MY NAME" said our Lord JESUS "  that will  I DO" an ample proof as I before remarked of his being truly GOD in  Effect  and  Power  as well as in  Name  and that  he and the Father are  ONE as he himself not only  said  but  proved  by his  Works  so that we must necessarily understand as there is but ONE GOD Jehovah that he is included with THE FATHER in the ONE Eternal Being JEHOVAH  that  THE FATHER  may be glorifed in  THE SON  If ye shall ask any thing in  MY NAME  our Lord JESUS again repeated and enforced his gracious promise  I WILL DO it  If ye love me  said he  keep  MY  commandments  and who hath a right  to command  but GODOur Lord nevertheless immediately after∣wards declares the  ministerial Office  which he had conde∣scended to undertake for our sake as  Mediator  between GOD and  Man  himself being both  And I  said he  will  PRAY THE FATHER  and he s  ll give you  ANOTHER COMFORTER  or ADVOCATE see ABp Sharp's Sermons vol Disc d  that he may abide with you for ever even  THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH  here the Three Divine Persons are distinctly mentioned together in their separate personal functions under the Christian Dispensation  "whom"  i e the Spirit of  Truth  the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him  and of course all other true disciples of Christ know him as the promises are  to all  and cannot fail  for he dwelleth with you and shall be  IN YOU  John xiv  Again I say unto you  said our Lord JESUS  that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of  MY FA∣THER  which is in heaven For where two or three are gathered together  IN MY NAME  i e in the Name of JESUS  there  AM  I in the midst of them  Matt xviii  These and many more such declarations of Christ are the  reiterated Promises  mentioned above on which the restored Dignity and Privileges of  Human Nature  are firmly founded and may be effectually secured if the future  building  be raised thereupon with the plumb line of  Integrity  and be afterwards maintained with  Perseve∣rance  to the end of life  "He is faithful that promised"  Heb x  Wherefore  be strong and of a good cou∣rage fear not nor be afraid for  THE LORD Jehovah THY GOD  he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee  Deut xxxi  Promises tendered in the most urgent and affectionate manner  that Prayers  in his Name  shall  certainly be effectual  that is provided there be no  wilful  Defect on our part which  conditional  Clause is always to be un∣derstood wherever Promises of Blessings are delivered in Holy Scripture  Let us therefore be mindful  that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy  to be compared  with the  glory which shall be revealed to us  Rom viii  that is  towards  us or respecting ourselves referring probably to that  Eternal Weight of Glory  with which  Human Nature  is capable of being invested  after the sufferings of this present time  as sig∣nified by the same Apostle in a parallel passage of another Epistle  For our light affliction  said the Apostle  which is but for a moment  i e com∣paratively speaking  worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of  GLORY  Cor iv  This further Revelation of God's  Will  va∣riously expressed in the New Testa∣ment  When Christ  who is  our life shall  APPEAR  then shall ye also appear with him  IN GLORY  Mortify therefore your members c  Col iii  For our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for  THE SAVIOUR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST  who shall change our vile  BODY  that it may be fashioned  LIKE UNTO  HIS GLORIOUS BODY  according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself  Ph iii  Beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall  APPEAR WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM  for we shall see him as he is And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure  John iii  But some  man  will say How are the dead raised up and  WITH WHAT BODY  do they come Thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die "And that which thou sowest thou sowest not that  BODY  that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other  grain  but God giveth it  A BODY  as it hath pleased him  AND TO EVERY SEED HIS OWN BODY  All flesh is not the same flesh but  there is  one  kind of  flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes  and  another of birds  c  So also  is  the resurrection of the dead It is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonour  IT IS RAISED IN GLORY  it is sown in weakness  IT IS RAISED IN POWER  it is sown a na∣tural  or    animal    BODY  it is raised  A SPIRI∣TUAL BODY  There is a natural  or animal  body and there is a spiritual body And so it is written The first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam  was made  a quickening Spirit  c  And as we have borne the image of the earthy  WE SHALL ALSO BEAR THE IMAGE OF THE HEAVENLY    i e  of the Lord Jehovah from  HEAVEN mentioned in the th verse see also pages  Now this I say  brethren that  FLESH AND BLOOD  cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth  CORRUPTION  inherit  IN∣CORRUPTION  By this latter part of the sentence i e  neither doth corruption haberit incorruption  the Apostle explains what he meant by the  flesh and blood  which  "cannot inherit"  c  "ita explicat"  as Grotius justly remarks  "quid intelligi voluerit per  et  " It is manifest from the whole context that the Apostle  by flesh and blood  in this text meant only  corruptible  and  perishable flesh and blood  for it is not  the substance  or solidity  of flesh and blood  which cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven but only  the corruptibility  or  dissoluble  and  corrupt quality of it  as another learned commentator Slater has re∣marked  Non intelligit  CORPORIS SUBSTANTIAM  sic enim resurget  Job xix  sed qualitatem corruptam  Pol Synop Vol V page  We have incontestable evidence by the resurrection and ascension of our Lord that the real human substances of  "flesh and bones"  of which his revived body consisted can and doth  inherit the kingdom of heaven  Our Lord was particularly careful to convince his disciples of this truth after his resurrection saying  Behold my hands and my feet  THAT IT IS I MYSELF  thus insisting upon  the identity  of his own person  handle me and see  thus urging his disciples to receive undeniable conviction by all their senses  for  A SPIRIT  says he  hath not  FLESH AND BONES  as ye see we have And when he had thus spoken he shewed them  his  hands and  his  feet  Luke xxiv  Now this was not to convince them merely that the  hands  and  feet  which he then shewed were  "flesh and bones"  but that they were also to undeniable de∣monstration the same identical  "flesh and bones"  that had been pub∣lickly nailed to the cross for our Lord shewed them likewise  his side  John xx  undoubtedly that same wounded  side  which had been pierced with a lance for it was manifestly on account of the  wounds  which he had received in his  flesh  that he now pointed  out as unquestionable evidences of his identical body those parti∣cular parts thereof his  hands feet  and  side  in which the principal wounds had been made agreeable to the predictions of the Prophets Ps xxii Zech xii and xiii and at the same time he submitted himself to the most critical examination of those select persons whom he had chosen for witnesses  It is I myself  says he  handle me and see  c That our Lord appealed to the evidence of real  wounds  in his  flesh  is further demonstrated by the declaration of the Apostle Thomas when he had heard the account of our Lord's appearance from the other disciples for Thomas answered them saying  Except I shall see in his  HANDS  the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his  SIDE  I will not believe  And accordingly this palpable and unquestion∣able demonstration was graciously allowed him even in the presence of the former witnesses for  After eight days again the disciples were within and  THOMAS  with them  then  came Jesus the doors being shut  AND STOOD IN THE MIDST  and said Peace  be  unto you Then saith he to  THOMAS  reach hither thy finger and behold  MY HANDS  and reach hither thy hand and  thrust  it into my side and be not faithless but believing  John xx  And after our Lord had at several other times Cor xv visited instructed and confirmed his disciples concerning  the truth and reality of his resurrection  and other necessary doctrines he at length ascended from among them towards heaven even while their whole attention was fixed upon him  "While they beheld"  says the text  he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight And while  THEY LOOKED STEDFASTLY    toward heaven  AS HE WENT UP  behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven  THIS SAME  JESUS  which is taken up from you  INTO HEAVEN  shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go  INTO HEAVEN  Acts i  Thus we have incontestible evidence concerning the identical sub∣stance of our Lord's revived body  "Flesh and Bones"  and therefore with certainty we know that the  Human Body  consisting of solid and palpable substances of  "Flesh and Bones"  is capable of  inherit∣ing the kingdom of heaven  and consequently we must understand that the  Flesh and Blood  mentioned by the Apostle which  cannot inherit  c must necessarily mean  corrupt  and  mortal Flesh and Blood  before it has undergone the promised  change  to  incorruption  and  immortality  as explained above for our Lord's body it is manifest if all these circumstances are considered could not possibly have undergone  any other change  than that of being "RAISED INCOR∣RUPTIBLE" whereas before it was  corruptible  or liable to injuries and  mortal  or it could not have  suffered  and  died  and in like manner all the rest of the "  dead shall be raised  INCORRUPTIBLE" as the resurrection of Christ is the pledge of our hope he being declared  "the first fruits of them that slept"  Cor xv I shall not apo∣logize to my readers for the length of this note because the subject of it very materially concerns  the Nature of Man  and all mankind are personally interested in the assurances we have that even the  Body  as well as the  Soul  shall one day be raised to  immortality  and eternal duration nevertheless I confess that I should have neglected to treat upon this very material part of my subject as I conceived that the doctrine was sufficiently understood and generally received among Christians had not a new pamphlet on very different prin∣ciples been put into my hands at the very time when I had pro∣ceeded in transcribing the above note for the press even to the very sentence where I have placed the mark of reference so that I thought myself obliged to add these remarks upon the text in order to guard against the plausible insinuations in the said Tract  Behold I shew you a mystery we  shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a mo∣ment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for  the trumpet shall sound  "For the trumpets  SHALL  sound"    says the Apostle but the Author of the New Pamphlet mentioned in the preceding  note boldly insinuates that it  shall  NOT  sound  And as this Author has thought proper to conceal his name I hope I may censure his opinions with less reserve because he cannot suspect me of any  per∣sonal  dislike to an unknown author and must therefore consider my severity as levelled merely against his erroneous doctrines and not against himself  Do you take the  LAST TRUMPET  says he in page  to be some instrumental sound  c  The word  LAST  says he again  evidently implies a  FIRST  now who is he that heard the instrumental sound of the  FIRST  Trumpet  Thus on the strength of a mere sophistical quibble he ventures to found his opposition to the clearest evidence of scripture that  the Trumpet  SHALL SOUND  and the dead shall be raised  as if these great articles of the Christian Faith  the Resurrection of the Dead  and the awful summons to the  Judgment Seat of Christ  could possibly be set aside by such superficial reasoning For though we may not be able to answer his question viz  Who is he that heard the instrumental sound of the  FIRST  Trum∣pet  Yet any plain honest Christian who reads his Bible with a proper humble disposition can easily inform him who they were even a whole nation at once that really and truly heard the actual sound of a  former  heavenly  trumpet  See the th chapter of Exodus wherein the  instrumental sound  is clearly expressed by two different tech∣nical Hebrew names of an  instrument  well known among the Israelites which seems to have been a kind of  horn  or  cornet  The use of such  in∣struments  is particularly recorded in Joshua vi for seven of them were  sounded  by the priests at the taking of Jericho The  sound  only of  one instrument  bearing two different names was heard at Mount Sinai tho' it is described as being loud to a most tremendous degree being a  hea∣venly  trumpet And answerable to this the future  heavenly  trumpet  foretold by St Paul is mentioned in the singular number viz  the trump of God  Thess iv  Now as the  sounding  of the  former  trumpet was previously appointed and foretold as the awful signal to apprize the Israelites of  the Coming of Jehovah  upon Mount Sinai and to summon them up to the Mount see Exodus xix and so the actual tremendous  sounding  of that former trumpet see verses and is an incontestible earnest or pledge to us even upon the principles of this author's own argument that we ought to expect an actual  sounding  also of the  last trumpet  because it is as clearly ap∣pointed to be the  awful signal  of the future  Coming  and  Appearance  of the  Messiah  to judge the world as the  former  trumpet was of the descent of  Jehovah  upon Mount Sinai so that the ingenious hypo∣thesis of this Author about the  soundless  summons of the  last  trumpet falls at once to the ground  There is such ample evidence God be thanked of  outward  tran∣sactions throughout the whole account which Moses has given of God's  coming down  upon Mount Sinai or Horeb which is only a different part of the same mountain that the  literal  sense of his relation cannot without the most glaring perversion be enveloped and darkened by the delusive mist of  figurative  sophistry And the same indeed may be said of what is revealed to us in the Scrip∣tures concerning the future  Coming  and  Appearance  of the Messiah to judge the world but this Author nevertheless presuming upon the sup∣posed force of his insidious quibble about the  last  trumpet ventures openly to profess his disbelief of the actual  future judgment of the world by Christ  and boldly asserts that  there will be no such process hereafter The judgment seat  says he  is in every man's heart and it is there and  THERE ONLY  that man can or  EVER WILL  feel acquittance or  CONDEMNATION  c  Note in p  And  this  unscriptural  doctrine he has attempted in a preceding part of his book to illustrate by an example drawn even from  Scripture  itself  When Paul stood before Felix  says he in p  Felix stood before the judgment seat of Christ else what made him tremble What but the secret condemnation he felt in his breast  But give me leave for a moment to treat this Author in his own evasive stile by  answering question with questions  though I by no means wish to avoid giving him a direct answer to his  trembling  system Would not Felix have had much less cause to  tremble  if with the  spirit  of our modern Author he had conceived that there would never be any other  condemnation  than that which he felt within himself And againDid not Felix  tremble  whilst or as the Apostle  "reasoned"    a genitive case  taken absolutely  as the gram∣marians say i e to mark the precise interval of any action or cor∣responding circumstance as that it happened  during the very time  that the Apostle  reasoned "of righteousness temperance  and THE JUDG∣MENT TO COME expressly  or the  future  judgment so that the Apostle could not possibly mean the  present  in∣ternal  condemnation  which at that very interval of time caused Felix to  tremble  Acts xxiv But this author not only denies the  future  JUDG∣MENT OF CHRIST but also it seems the  future  RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD  He feels  " speaking in p of a man that has the witness within himself "  that he is  RISEN WITH CHRIST  and so experiences with St Paul  THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION  and being made  A PARTAKER OF THE FIRST RESURRECTION  flesh and blood then convinces him what it is  c Now as he thus asserts that he is "made a partaker of the first resurrection" and that there will be  "no process hereafter"  nor  judgment of Christ  besides that which as he conceives is in every man's heart it necessarily follows that  with respect to himself and such other  "truly awakened such"  this Author must suppose  the resurrection to be already past  This is  a lead∣ing principle  which being once admitted all the other doctrines which this Author has laboured to inculcate must necessarily follow as concomitant circumstances the perusal of his book therefore enables us to form a very probable idea of the particular doctrines held by those very ancient heretics  Hymeneus  and  Philetus  for tho' this author himself a  similar spirit  conceives that his doctrines are  not only uncommon but n  w  c and accordingly in his preface apologizes for  "the untrodden path"  yet his path is very old and so strongly marked in antiquity that the  leading principle  abovementioned on which almost all the rest depends was described more than years ago even by St Paul himself who mentioned the promoters of it ex∣pressly by name and warned us against the pernicious effects of their errors in the strongest terms  Their word  says the Apostle  will eat as doth a canker of whom is  HYMENEUS  and  PHILETUS  who concerning the truth have  ERRED  saying that the  RESURREC∣TION IS PAST ALREADY  and overthrow the faith of some  Tim ii  and  THE DEAD  shall be  raised  INCORRUPTIBLE  and we shall be  CHANGED  That is  we living men  whoever we are that shall be  found alive and remaining in the body at that awful period  "shall be changed"  for the Apostle had before de∣clared  that  "we shall not all sleep"  that is in death but we "  shall all be  CHANGED" viz both  Dead  and  Living  shall be  changed  from  corruptible  to  incorruptible  Beings  though the manner of THE CHANGE will be different in these two different states of mankind the  Dead  will be RAISED  incorruptible  but the  Living  shall be instanta∣neously rendered so  "in the twinkling of an eye"  Thus  the change  will be made in the  property  or  quality  of our living bodies and not in the  identity  of them It will be an annihilation or dissolution of  corruptibility  and not of  substance  for the  substance  on the contrary will be ren∣dered  indissoluble  and  eternal  even that substance which now is subject to so many fatal accidents diseases and death  For  THIS CORRUPTIBLE  must put on  INCOR∣RUPTION  and this mortal  must  put on  IMMORTALI∣TY  So that it is manifestly  "this"  same  mortal  body  "this"  earthly tabernacle in which we now live that shall hereafter  "put on"  immortality and incorruption  We that are in  this  tabernacle do groan  says the same Apostle in another place  being burdened not for that we would be  UNCLOTHED  but  CLOTHED UPON  that mortality might be swallowed up of life  Cor v  and this is further explained in the former text viz  So when  THIS CORRUPTIBLE says the Apostle  shall have  PUT ON  incorruption and  THIS MORTAL  shall have  PUT ON  immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in victory O death where is thy sting c  Cor xv  concerning the sure and most certain expectation that we may  entertain of being invested with ETER∣NAL GLORY  in the world to come  if we  persevere in the true Faith and Practice of Christianity  in this world  completes  our  Charter of Privileges and Immunities  or  "the perfect Law of Liberty"  which  THE ALMIGHTY has been pleased to tender to his Creature  Man    Who  then  shall separate us from the love of Christ  shall  tribu∣lation  or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword  As it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted  as sheep for the slaughter Nay in all these things we are more than con∣querors  through him that loved us For I am persuaded  said the Apostle to the Romans  that neither death nor life nor angels  that is the angels of Satan  nor principalities nor pow∣ers nor things present nor things to come nor heighth nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord  Rom viii  Here is a noble declaration of that  "perfect Liberty"  to which Christ has  restored mankind that glorious Dignity of  "Human Nature"  which even the poorest and meanest persons amongst us the  distressed  the  hungry  and the  naked  are capable of attaining by Perseverance  in Faith  and Resolution in observing and keeping  on their Part  THE CON∣DITIONS  The conditions of our reciprocal covenant with God  Let us but satisfy ourselves that we per∣form  the conditions  which Christ hath required of man∣kind in order to salvation which  conditions  are all summed up in these two words  Faith  and  Repentance  and we may be as certainly assured that we belong to God and are entitled to his favour as if we saw our particular names recorded in a book among them that are appointed to salvation Away therefore with all fears and doubts concerning our  eternal Predestination  Let us never be solicitous in enquiring whether God hath decreed such a particular number of persons in exclusion to the rest of mankind to eternal life or if he hath done so whether we be in the number of them but let us take care to secure our own duty  Secret things belong to the Lord our God but the things that are revealed to us and to our children that we may do all the works of his law  as we have it in  Deuteronomy  Let us take care to obey God's commandments let us  live as well as we can and if we do so it is certain we cannot miscarry and if God hath made any such  Eternal Decrees  concerning the lot of particular persons it is certain likewise that we are in the number of those that are  predestinated  to eternal salvation provided we continue in our faith and obedience  ABp Sharp's Sermon  "Of the Fewness of those who shall be saved"  Vol III p  of our reciprocal Cove∣nant with God  Let us therefore like the Apostle approach unto the Throne of Grace  in full Assurance of  FAITH always remem∣bering that a SOUND FAITH must be the principal Foundation of our Pre∣tensions to the promised  Dignity and Privileges of  HUMAN NATURE and that by Perseverance in the true Faith and a continual Renewal of those in∣estimable Claims from time to time while we remain in this world we may be as confident as the Apostle that  neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor heighth nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from  THE LOVE  OF GOD  which is in  CHRIST JESUS  our Lord  because  through him  God has put it absolutely in our own Power whatever our  temporary  Afflictions and Sufferings may be in this Life to attain an "ETERNAL WEIGHT OF GLORY" Cor iv  For which cause we faint not    though our outward man perish  being fully persuaded that he who PROMISED is  able also to  PERFORM  The Defects of this Tract wherever the Reader discovers any are certainly to be attributed to the fallible Author whose Name is prefixed but whatever may seem praiseworthy and instructive therein to GOD ALONE  "SOLI DEO GLORIA ET GRATIA"  INDEX
