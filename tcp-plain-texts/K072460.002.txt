ill and without a miracle in his favour we must lose him O heavens my heart is ready to burst when I think of his affliction For these six days I have not closed my eyes and am now so weak that I can scarcely hold my pen You must come home immediately The servant who delivers you this letter will return with you Your father desires earnestly to see you "Maurice my dear Maurice if I could embrace him before I die" he has repeated a hundred times in the day Would to heaven that you were here now However do not lose a moment in packing up your things and I have ordered the man to make all possible expedition Every moment will be an age of anxiety to me until I clasp you in my arms Adieu my dear child may the Lord protect you from all dangers on your journey I wait your return with the most lively impatience and am  Your ever affectionate mother CECILIA LAVINGTON  Oxford  Dear Cousin  I have now no other friend but you to apply to and from you alone I can hope for comfort in a misfortune too weighty for me to bear Heaven has deprived me of  what was dearest to me on earth my beloved husband You know how sincere and tender an affection I bore him This day se  nnight he desired me to send for our son from school When Maurice was brought up to his Bed he stretched out his hand to him and had scarcely given him his blessing before he expired With him is gone all the satisfaction and happiness of my life You see me now plunged into a situation the most distressful and afflicting to a woman and a mother Yet if I suffered alone I could bear it but my poor son sighs by my side He is not yet sensible of the misfortune of being an orphan It wounds my heart to see him look up to me with tears in his eyes while he presses my hand and speaks of his father None but a mother can have an idea of so afflicting a sight I think at those times that I read in his looks these melancholy words "It is you alone my dear mother that must maintain me now" Wherever I go he is at my side and wipes the tears from his little eyes with my gown Sorrow stops my voice when I would comfort him for the very sight of my child renews all my afflictions How shall I maintain him My poor husband has left me nothing and my hands are too feeble to work To whom then shall I look for assistance unless to you On you alone I rest all my hopes Heaven I doubt not will dispose your heart to relieve a destitute and forlorn widow and to prove that the ties of blood which unite us are sacred I give up my son to your care Whatever kindness you shew to him I shall receive as performed for my sake and for the memory of a man who loved you All the strength and spirits that I have left I will exert to gain myself a livelihood by working but to bring up my son properly is beyond my power I give him up therefore to you entirely However seve  e it may be to part with my child I must yield to necessity In the mean time I comfort myself in the reflexion that I rely on the favour of a merciful God and the kindness of a worthy relation Be you to him as a father and enable him one day to soften my afflictions I am unable to proceed My tears which wet my paper shew you sufficiently what my heart feels You have it in your power to determine my happiness and the wellbeing of my son God will for ever  bless your liberality he will reward you even in this world for your kindness to two unfortunate relations I am dear cousin  Your disconsolate kinswoman c CECILIA LAVINGTON  Oxford  Madam  Yours of the th inst in which you inform me of your husband's death has given me the sincerest affliction You may be assured I partake of your grief and feel still more for your loss than for my own Yet I must confess I cannot help being a good deal surprized that you think of applying to me alone for assistance Is it absolutely necessary that your son should have the education of a scholar and add another to the number of halflearned smatterers that are already in the world Are there not many other professions in which he may render as great services to society and labour to more advantage for his own interest Consider with yourself how without fortune or friends will he be able to advance himself You know the world too well to make it necessary for me to shew you that such an attempt would be impracticable On the other hand it would be unpleasing to yourself to see him chargeable to strangers You speak of the ties of blood but my own family which is very numerous puts me more forcibly in mind of them and I beg you to believe that it is with great difficulty I can maintain them in a suitable manner To load myself with an additional burthen is absolutely out of my power and I am convinced that upon more mature reflexion you will dispense with my doing so All that I can do is to put your son apprentice to a mercer at Rochester a Mr Durant with whom I have concerns in business I promise you he shall be well treated there You may send him upon trial for some time and if approved he will take him without a fee Consider maturely of my offer and let me know your determination and your son's If he resolves to go to the University it is absolutely out of my power to maintain him there I  request you to accept the enclosed order for four guineas as a proof of my concern for your present distressed situaation and to believe me  Madam  c  London  Dear Sir  I cannot forget the care that you and Mrs Masters took of me while at your academy though I have at present scarcely strength to write you these lines of acknowledgement But my mama who sits by me crying is unable through grief to take pen in hand and has said that task on me who am so unfit for it However from remembering your constant kindness to me I find some satisfaction in writing to you though I may succeed but indifferently You are already informed I suppose of my papa's death Ah sir what you foretold me is not come to pass You bid me not to be uneasy that I should perhaps when I came home find my papa out of danger But alas he is dead My mama is now a poor widow and I an orphan I dreaded no less as I came near our house I had fallen asleep in the chaise and dreamed that my papa was in heaven and that he took me by the hand and spoke to me At this I awoke and in waking seemed to hear the passingbell toll Yet we were not near the house and had more than three miles to go yet At last when I arrived my mama was at our door waiting for me all in tears She kissed me and took me up stairs to my papa who was in bed and almost speechless When I kissed him oh dear how I cried and sobbed At this he opened his eyes and seeing me laid his hand upon my head and gave me his blessing but in so faint a voice as scarcely to be heard Ah you cannot imagine how my mama and I cried All his neighbours and acquaintance were in tears too at his funeral but mama and I more than any body I begin to eat and drink a little but my mama has absolutely taken no nourishment so that she is as pale as death and I beg of her continually not to die for then I do not know what would become of me in this world Ah dear sir you may imagine how great a trouble it is to mama and me that I am not able to continue my  education But it cannot be otherwise and I must be content My mama has written to her cousin in London who is a rich merchant to request him to maintain me at school but he will not and he says that I shall be no better than a halflearned smatterer For my part I think I might have learning enough if my mother had the tenth part of his money But no I must go apprentice to Mr Durant the mercer at Rochester I cannot tell you how much that grieves me Mama strives to comfort me and tells me that it is a reputable line of business and that I may make a fortune by following it with application But what does all this signify when one dislikes it You know dear sir that learning was all to me I wished to be as good a scholar and divine as my papa Before I had always a book in my hand now I shall be employed measuring silks with a yard But I must hold my tongue since it cannot be otherwise Dear sir I wish you happiness and shall always think of you I hope too that you will not forget me and thank you again for your kind treatment of me I suppose Mr Durant will seldom take me to London so that as I pass there in my way to Rochester I shall go and see you and Mrs Masters and if ever I come into great business you shall take whatever you please in my shop without paying a farthing Only try You shall see Meantime I am and ever shall be  Dear sir  as you used to call me your little friend MAURICE LAVINGTON  Oxford  Maurice Mrs Lavington Oxford  Maurice  Ah mama the stage is ready to set off  Mrs Lav  in tears  My dear child are you going then to leave me  Maurice  Pray mama do not cry so or I shall be dull all the journey Where are my gloves Ah they are on my hands I do not know what I am doing  Mrs Lav  What pain it is to part with you I will accompany you at least a little way out of town  Maurice  Nay dear mama you are already so ill and so weak  Mrs Lav  It is but half a mile my dear  Maurice  But you know the doctor says that you must take care of yourself If you were to come home worse and be obliged like my pap  to take to your bed and die I should be the cause of it No you must not stir out or else I'll not go  Mrs Lav  Well my dear child then I will stay  Maurice  Yes mama do not move out and when I am gone He down on the bed and try to rest  Mrs Lav  Oh I wish I could  Maurice  Good bye good mama  Mrs Lav  God bless you and watch over you my dear child Be good honest and industrious and make your mother happy  Maurice  You shall see mama you shall see that I will make you happy  Mrs Lav  Write to me regularly at least once a fortnight  Maurice  Yes every week mama and will you write to me too  Mrs Lav  Can you ask that I shall now have no other pleasure upon earth But shall we ever see each other again in this world  Maurice  Oh yes we shall see each other again I will take care to behave so well that I will get leave to come and see you in six months But mama the stage is going off I must leave you  Mrs Lav  One kiss more my dear child Farewel  They wave their hands until out of sight  Mr Durant Mr Durant Maurice Rochester  What do you bring me there my little gentleman  Maurice  A letter sir my name is Lavington I suppose you know what it concerns  Mr Durant  Oh you are little Lavington I am glad to see you I like your face very well Have you a taste for business  Maurice  sighing  Why yes sir  Mr Durant  You have been some time at school can you read  Maurice  Yes sir I could read when I was only five years old and now I am twelve  Mr Durant  Then your father must have begun pretty early with you Can you write too and cast accompts How much is times  Maurice  and times make and times makestop a momentmake and add to th  it makes exactly the present year of our Lord  Mr Durant  How Why you cast accompts like a banker I shall be glad to have so clever a little boy behind my counter  Maurice  I hope sir I shall give you satisfaction  Mr Durant  According as you behave yourself  Maurice  Sir I ask no better  Mr Durant  I make no doubt but we shall be good friends  Maurice  O sir you shall never have reason to find fault with me I love my mama too well to run the risk of grieving her  Mr Durant  Come then I will introduce you to my wife and children I have two much about your age  Maurice  I hope sir to gain the regard of all your family  Lady Abberville Maurice  Maurice  carrying a piece of sattin rolled up  Your servant madam Mr Durant gives his compliments to your ladyship and sends the twelve yards of sattin of the pattern that you shewed him You know the price madam  Lady Abber  He asked me thirteen shillings at the first word That is something dear  Maurice  Have you a measure in the house madam  Lady Abber  Mr Durant is an honest man I never measure after him How much does it come to  Maurice  Seven pounds sixteen shillings madam  Lady Abber  That is a good deal of money Has he ordered you to receive it  Maurice  That is as your ladyship pleases  Lady Abber  Well there are seven pounds sixteen shillings I shall call on him for a receipt but if I were disposed to cheapen cannot you abate me something  Maurice  Yes madam Mr Durant told me that I should abate a shilling a yard  Lady Abber  Well my little boy that is very honest I am perfectly well pleased with your sincerity Let me see that makes twelve shillings  Maurice  Yes madam I have twelve shillings to return you  Lady Abber  Keep them yourself my little friend This is my birthday and I will make you a present of them  Maurice  Madam I beg pardon I cannot take them  Lady Abber  You shall it is my property and I give it to you  Maurice  Perhaps Mr Durant would take it amiss  Lady Abber  That is my concern I shall make that up  Maurice  Madam I return you a thousand thanks This money shall not stay long in my pocket I will send it off directly to my mama and mention your ladyship to her in my letter I shall go and write it immediately  Lady Abber  No no I must not let you go so fast I see that we have a good deal to say to each other Tell me in the first place who is your mama and where does she live  Maurice  Ah my poor mama is widow to a clergyman of Oxford My papa is dead these two months He was too charitable to the poor to leave much money behind him He kept me at school for three years near London but I was sent home a little before he died because he wished to see me once more And as it was not in mama's power to continue my education a kinsman of hers sent me to be apprentice to Mr Durant the mercer I am with him upon trial But if my relation that is so rich had thought proper I should have gone to the University and taken my degrees Ah I should have been happy to follow my studies and to become one day a great scholar I was always the foremost in my class and my masters were very fond of me The next time that your ladyship shall have occasion for any thing from us I will shew you a letter from our head master which I received a week ago You will see by it how fond  he was of me Ay and he says he will be fond of me as long as he lives  Lady Abber  I do not doubt it my good child You have already made me very fond of you though this is the first time that ever I have seen you But tell me would you be glad to go from behind the counter and return to school  Maurice  Ah if that was possible But my mama cannot do it she has not money enough and schooling is expensive  Lady Abber  Yes but if your mother has not there are many people in the world that have more than enough What would you say if I were to send you to a gentleman who should examine you to see if you have made good use of the time that you have spent at school and are likely to make a progress if you should return thither  Maurice  O madam how happy should I be Pray send me to the gentleman directly You shall see what he will say of me And then I may learn what I have not yet had time to know  Lady Abber  Do you know the principal academy of this town  Maurice  Oh yes madam I have often sighed as I passed by the door of it  Lady Abber  Well stay a moment  She sits down before her bureau writes a letter and gives it to Maurice  There run to the academy and ask for the master You must speak to himself You will give my compliments to him and request him to send a line in answer to my note  Maurice  But madam I am in a hurry to send these twelve shillings to my mama  Lady Abber  You can wait till tomorrow Perhaps you may have still better news to send her  Maurice  I will first madam carry your letter and then hasten to Mr Durant who waits for me  Lady Abber  Take care not to go astray  Maurice  Oh I shall find my way I wish your ladyship good morning In less than half an hour the master of the academy shall have your letter I will fly to him like a bird  The Master of the Academy Maurice Rochester  Maurice  Sir I have a note for you from Lady Oh dear I have forgot her name But I will run back to her to know it  The Master  There is no occasion for that child I suppose the lady's name is to the note  He opens and looks at the bottom  Lady Abberville Oh it is a hand that I know very well  reads  Sir  The child whom I send to you is a poor orphan His father is lately dead and his mother has been under the necessity of taking him from school in order to put him apprentice He seems however to have a strong desire for learning therefore I beg as a favour that you will have the goodness to examine him and if you form any hopes of him I shall charge myself with his education This being my birth day puts me in mind of the duty to which we are born that of doing good to our fellowcreatures and this child seems to have been sent by heaven to be the object of it I request you to give me your opinion of him and am sir c  Take a seat my little man I shall be at your service in a minute I am in haste to finish a letter  Maurice  Oh sir what fine books you have there it is a long time since I have looked into any Will you please to let me open one while you write  The Master  With all my heart my dear  Maurice  Hah this is Homer But it is in Greek It is too hard for me I never read it but in English  The Master  What have you read Homer And what do you think of him  Maurice  He is  of fine passages and especially of beautiful  Only I with that Achille had not been so passionate and stubborn  The Master  What instances of passion or stubbornness do you find in him  Maurice  Was it well done of him to leave the Greeks in distress Was it their fault if he quarrelled with Agamemnon They had done  him  no wrong Should not he have suffered himself to be persunded when the deputies came to make submission to him in his tent But no he  remains immoveable as a rock I should not have let them entreat me so long I should have followed them at the first word  The Master  Then you are very goodnatured  Maurice  We should be so towards all men and especially to our countrymen Oh you have a Sophocles too The tragedy of Philoctetes I believe is by him I have read it in English It is a very moving play But I'll tell you sir what I liked best in it  The Master  I should be glad to know  Maurice  It is a young GrecianWhat is this his name is  The Master  Neoptolemus  Maurice  Yes yes Neoptolemus It is when hecomes back and brings Philoctetes his bow and arrows I think that I should have done the same But I beg pardon sir perhaps my talk grows tiresome to you  The Master  Not at all  listen to you with pleasure Besides my letter is finished  Maurice  Then sir I will beg you to tell me what fine book of prints that is that  ies open on your  esk  The Master  It is a collection of engravings from the finest paintings in the gallery at Florence  Maurice  That is Jupiter I know him  The Master  How do you like him  Maurice  I like the picture very well but not Mr Jupiter  The Master  Why not  Maurice  Because he was an odious character I do not know how the Greeks and Romans could be such fools as to worship him He was quite a libertine and always quarrelling with Juno Is that acting like a god  The Master  You are right He was an improper and contemptible object of worship However nothing has been handed down to us concerning him but the imaginations of the vulgar and you know that the people has always been blind and superstitious  Maurice  Why our peasants nowadays have more sense Only imagine sir the clergyman of a parish going into the pulpit and preaching that God almighty has a wife whom he deceives and scolds every day His parishioners would not believe a word of it  The Master  How comes it that the vulgar are now more sensible than in former times  Maurice  From the light of the gospel There every thing shews a just and good God If I had lived in Greece and had possessed such a book they would never have worshipped any other than the God that we worship  The Master  Kiss me my fine boy what is your name  Maurice  Maurice Lavington  The Master  Indeed my dear Maurice it would be a pity that you passed your life behind a counter You must apply yourself to learning again  Maurice  Ah I should like that very well if it was in my power  The Master  I will give you my answer to Lady Abberville  Maurice  Sir I shall take it with pleasure But she requests you sir I believe to have the kindness to examine me  The Master  I have done that already I can judge of your understanding and your heart Perhaps I may have the pleasure of contributing to procure you a more happy lot Amuse yourself in looking over these prints while I write my answer  Maurice  Or rather sir oblige me with a pen and some paper I will write too  The Master  To your benefactress  Maurice  No sir to another person  The Master  May not I know to whom  Maurice  When my letter is finished sir you shall see it  The Master  I long to have a view of it  They both sit down Maurice writes the following letter  Dear Sir  I thank you a thousand times for your kindness in taking notice of me and in writing to Lady Abberville I should be very happy to return to my former school where every body loves me but since you will be the occasion of my happiness I shall be glad to enjoy it under your eye If I am so lucky as to be admitted into your academy I will love you with all my heart I hope I shall be diligent and well behaved and learn every thing that you will be kind enough to teach me I hardly dare  hope that it will be so That depends on the will of Providence and yours But if I remain with Mr Durant you will not refuse me the pleasure of coming to see you now and then and of discoursing a little with you and reading your fine books otherwise I shall soon forget all that I have learned at school and I should be sorry for that although it be not much I hope dear sir you will have the goodness to oblige me and I will let my mama know it to comfort her sorrows for she is very fond of me and I too of her Perhaps one day  The Master  Well Maurice is your letter finished  Maurice  No sir not quite I have more to say than you have But there sir read it such as it is  The Master  How is this Why it is addressed to me Well this is charming No my good little Maurice you shall not remain at Mr Durant's but shall come to me if you like it better You will go now to Lady Abberville Give her this note with my humble respects and let me know what she says of it  Maurice  O dear shall I be so happy  The Master  Go and heaven befriend you  Maurice  Oh I shall run and be back again directly  Bowing to the master  Your servant sir  Lady Abberville Maurice Rochester  Lady Abberville  Well Maurice do you bring me an answer  Maurice  Yes madam here it is  Lady Abber  I am curious to know what it says nothing very favourable I am afraid  Maurice  Oh nothing to my prejudice madam I am sure  Lady Abber    reads to herself  Madam  You could not give me a more sensible pleasure tha  what I felt in the conversation of this amiable child His looks full of ingenuous innocence the lively spirit that appears in his eyes and animates his discourse have warmly attached me to him To shine as a man of letters is more suitable to his genius than to pursue the line to  which his father's death and the poverty of his family had destined him I congratulate you madam that you chose for the object of your generosity a child of so fair hopes Heaven seems to have thrown him in your way for that purpose I am strongly persuaded that his behaviour and sentiments will never give you cause to repent and shall esteem myself very happy if by my cares I can promote your generous intentions  I have the honour to be c  Lady Abber  The master seems to be only half satisfied with you  Maurice  Oh madam he is quite satisfied He told me so and I can see it in your eyes  Lady Abber  Ay Can you see it there my little cunning man But to speak seriously if there was a person that would take the charge of your maintenance and education what would you do for that person  Maurice  What would I doI hardly know I can do nothing of myself but I would pray for that person from the bottom of my heart both day and night  Lady Abber  Then you shall pray for me my dear child as for your second mother  Maurice  Will you be my mama  Lady Abber  Yes I will Your father is dead I will fill his place and do ev  thing for you that he would You shall go to your learning again and nothing shall be wanting to your education  Maurice  On dear my good mama I can hardly speak for joy  Lady Abber  If you love me you will never call me any thing but mama remember  Maurice  Oh yes mama I am as happy as a king  Lady Abber  You will lose your little senses Come be composed and let us take a walk in the garden I have something to say to you of your mother  Mr Durant Maurice Rochester  Mr Durant  Where have you been so long  Maurice  Oh Mr Durant if you knew  Mr Durant  Knew I know that you should not be so long on an errand Do not let this be the case another time What could not you find Lady Abberville at home  Maurice  Yes sir I found her and I found in her a second mother  Mr Durant  What stuff is this Are you mad  Maurice  No sir but I am going to my learning again I shall be put to an academy in a few days and my mama Lady Abberville will come tomorrow and speak to you about it  Mr Durant  What do not you chuse to stay with me then  Maurice  Why sir I like learning and study better than business  Mr Durant  So then you are only come hither to go away again You have deceived me  Maurice  No sir I should be very sorry I had not a thought of going and could have staid here contentedly But suppose yourself in my place for a moment If my papa had not died I should not have quitted school to live here A worthy lady acts to me like a parent and offers to put me to school again is it a fault in me to accept her ladyship's offer  Mr Durant  Well you are only upon trial here it is true and your choice is free You are very right However I wish I had never seen you for I began to be fond of you and now I shall grieve to part with you  Goes out  Maurice  Mr Durant is something blunt but a very worthy man I shall be sorry to leave him and his wife and his children But I must write to mama Oh how happy will she be on reading my letter I wish that she had it now in her hands and that I were by her side the next moment  He begins to write  Dear Mama  Joy joy you are now free from all trouble and I too Do not however let tears of joy hinder you from reading my letter This is the story of my happiness Mr Durant sent me this morning to carry some sattin to Lady Abberville Oh an excellent lady Ah if you were here now but do you know mama that you are  to be here before a week she will give you an apartment in her house and you will live with her and I shall go to school and shall come to see you whenever you chuse Oh that will be a happiness such a happiness you remember for all that how you cried when I was leaving you You said that you kissed me perhaps for the last time I hope now you will never have that to fear again My mama is to send you money for the journey for she is as much my mama as you are and I am very sure that you will not be angry at that All the money however that you receive in this parcel is not from her there are twelve shillings from me She gave them to me and I send them to you Make haste to get every thing in readiness for your journey hither the sooner you come the happier we shall be I have spoken so well of you to the lady that she wishes to see you almost as much as I do Set out set out I shall watch the coming of every stage to tell you the whole story before you see her though I suppose she tells it to you herself in the letter that she writes to you today I have not time to add more for I should be afraid that my letter would be too late if I wrote all that I have to say  I am dear mama c  Madam  How shall I find words to express to you my joy and gratitude Gracious heaven my misfortunes are then at an end I am happy and my child also and to you we owe that we are so How shall I be able to bear so sudden an elevation from a gulph of misery to the summit of joy I have only tears to express what I feel and I am sorry that I cannot give you even this testimony of my gratitude personally at this moment You have wished to be a mother therefore you may perhaps form an idea of my happiness as for me I want words to express it and I shall want them perhaps still more when I for the first time see my son placed between us both and our arms intermingled in embracing him But you will understand my silence which the ardor and sincerity of my attachment to you shall perfectly explain every moment of my life  I have the honour to be c  Oxford  THE PARRICIDE  WHAT dreadful weather I perish with cold and have no shelter against the bitter winds no bed to warm my benumbed limbs I am old and my strength is exhausted by labour Unnatural son The thought of you tears my heart Unnatural son I gave you life I nourished you and took care of your weak and sickly infancy When I saw you suffer through illness my tears fell upon your cheeks You loved me at that time and would say while you caressed me "Papa what makes you cry I am not sick now do not be troubled see I am quite well" You raised yourself up in your bed your little hands would play in my hair and you would say again "Do not grieve any more I am cured" And as you spoke the words you would fall down again through weakness You would strive to speak but could not At last however your body grew strong you became hale and robust and you should have been the prop of my old age I laboured all my life for you and now you shut me out of your house in the midst of wind and snow "We cannot live together any longer father" said you to me in your fury And why not my son What have I done to you I have exhorted you to virtue that is all my crime When I saw you spend in debauchery the earnings of sixty years labour the fortune of which I willingly stripped myself to enrich you I pointed out your danger to you God is my witness that I was more anxious on your account than on my own Was I not silent long enough for fear of troubling you But my silence and my sorrow which I strove to hide made no impression on you I was then obliged to speak I thought it my duty then to resume the prerogative of a father yet my authority was tempered with mildness My discourse was as tender as it was earnest I spoke to you of your mother who died through grief on account of your disorderly life I spoke to you of myself whom the same cause would probably send to my grave I shewed you my aged cheeks almost worn with the tears that you have made me shed I shewed you my grey hairs which stood on end through anguish and sorrow I opened  my arms to you to invite you to my bosom I should have fallen on my knees to you if your father even in that humble posture could have softened you And you my sonI can scarcely believe it yetyou advanced towards me with a threatening air your arm was stretched out and your gate shut against me You my son You are no longer so Why do my bowels still feel the yearnings of a father towards you I am tempted to wish that I could curse you but no I dare not breathe forth even my complaints aloud I fear left heaven should hear them and left this house which you have shut against me should fall upon your door I will lay myself down on the stone before your door Tomorrow you cannot come out without seeing me and I hardly think that your heart will not soften when you see what I shall have suffered during this dreadful night But if the severity of the season if my exhausted old age and still more the sorrows that wound my heart should occasion my death then shudder at thy crime weep for me and for yourself still more Ah I should think my death a fortunate circumstance if it could produce your reformation  Such were the complaints of this old man But the north wind all the livelong night carried away his sighs unheard The tempest filled the air with dreadful whistlings the shattered trees of the forest were bent down and all nature seemed to shudder with horror at the crime of his son The next morning the old man was found dead upon the stone He had hishands clasped together and his face turned towards heaven The name of his son was the last word that he had pronounced He had prayed to the very last moment for the parricide  JONATHAN  JONATHAN a gardener of Lincoln was looked upon as the most skilful in the county His fruits surpassed those of his neighbours in bigness and were always found to have an exquisite flavour All the first gentlemen round about were ambitious of having his peaches at their deserts so that he had no occasion to send his melons to  the market they were bespoke on the beds and very often could not be had for gold The reputation that he obtained and the profits that he drew from his labours increased his assiduity in the cultivation of his garden Rich and industrious as he was he easily found a proper match and espoused Claribell a young woman in the neighbourhood as prudent as she was handsome The first year of their marriage was very happy Claribell assisted her husband in his labours and the fruits of their garden were more prosperous than ever  Unhappily for Jonathan near his house there lived another gardener called Guzzle who at day break fixed himself in an alehouse which he seldom left before night Jonathan was delighted with Guzzle's hearty humour and was not long before he fell into the same taste At first he went now and then to meet him at the alehouse and only talked to him of gardening but very soon in his own garden he talked to him of nothing but strong beer Claribell grieved at the change in her husband's behaviour As she had not as yet sufficiedt experience herself to undertake the care of the walltrees she was frequently obliged to bring him home to his work and usually found him amongst his pots and glasses Alas it would often have been better for him to stay from the garden His head was now generally muddled with beer when he went to work upon his trees and his pruningknife cut away at random amongst the branches those that bore were cut as well as those that did not and the fine peach trees on which last year there had not been  single bough unfruitful did now only stretch their lazy arms like so many yawning idlers The more Jonathan found his garden decay the more fond he grew of this sottish way of life His fruit and his vegetables had lost their great name and not being able by his earnings to satisfy his fondness for drink he parted by degrees with his furniture his linen and his clothes At length one day when his wife was gone to market with some roots that she had reared herself he went and sold all his garden utensils in order to drink the money with Guzzle It would be difficult to describe Claribell's grief at her return To be reduced from a moderate competency to the most destitute poverty was not the height of her misfortune She felt still more strongly for the fate of her husband  and of a young infant six months old which she had then at the breast Who should suppose that this child was to save the whole family from destruction  The evening of the same day Jonathan came home swearing threw himself into a chair and leaning on his elbow over the table surlily asked his wife for something to eat Claribell handed him a large caseknife and a basket that was covered with her apron Jonathan snatched the apron off but what was his surprize to see his own child fast asleep in the basket "Eat there said Claribell to him it is all that I have left to give you You are the Father of this child and if you do not devour him famine and misery shortly will" Jonathan thunderstruck at these words remained speechless with his eyes stupidly fixed upon his son At length his sorrow broke out in tears and exclamations He rises and embracing his wife asks her pardon and promises to reform and he kept his word  His father in law who for some time had refused to see him being informed of his good intentions advanced him a sum to enable him to put his garden in order again Jonathan made good use of this supply and very soon his garden flourished as happily as ever He became once more and continued even to his old age active industrious a good husband and a good father He took pleasure sometimes though he blushed at the same time in telling this story to his son who from his example conceived such an aversion to drinking and idleness that he was all his life as sober as he was laborious  VANITY PUNISHED  A DRAMA in one ACT  CHARACTERS  MR WALLER  MRS WALLER  VALENTINE  Their Son  MR RAY  Friends to Mr Waller  MR NASH  Friends to Mr Waller  MICHAEL  a Country boy  MARTIN  the Gardener  SCENE I A GARDEN  Mr Waller Mrs Waller  Mr W  YONDER is our Valentine walking in the garden with a book in his hand I am very much afraid that it is rather through vanity than from a real desire of improving himself that he always appears to be busy reading  Mrs W  What makes you think so my dear  Mr W  Do not you remark that he casts a sidelook now and then to see if any body takes notice of him  Mrs W  And yet his masters give a very flattering account of his diligence and all agree that he is very far advanced for his age  Mr W  That is true But if my suspicions are right and if the little that he can know has made him vain I would rather a hundred times that he knew nothing and were modest  Mrs W  That he knew nothing  Mr W  Yes my dear A man without any great extent of knowledge but upright modest and industrious is a much more estimable member of society than a learned man whose studies have turned his head and puffed up his heart  Mrs W  I cannot think that my son is of that description  Mr W  Heaven forbid But while we are here in the country I shall have more opportunities of observing  him and I am resolved to take advantage of the first that shall offer to clear up my doubts I see him coming towards us Leave me alone with him a moment  SCENE II  Mr Waller Valentine  Val to Michael whom he pushes back  No leave me Papa it is that little fool of a country boy that comes always to interrupt me in my reading  Mr W  Why do you call that goodnatured child a little fool  Val  Why he knows nothing  Mr W  Of what you have learnt I grant you but then he knows many things which you do not and you may both inform each other a good deal if you will communicate what you know one to the other  Val  He may learn a good deal of me but what can I learn from him  Mr W  If ever you should have a farm do you think that it would be of no service to you to have an early notion of the labours of the country to learn to distinguish trees and plants to know the times of sowing and harvest and to study the wonders of vegetation Michael possesses these different parts of knowledge and desires no better than to share them with you They will perhaps be one day of the greatest use to you Those on the contrary that you could communicate would be of no service to him So that you see in this intercourse all the advantage is on your side  Val  Well but papa would it become me to learn any thing from a little country boy  Mr W  Why not if he is capable of instructing you I know no real distinction amongst men than that of useful talents and good manners and you must own that in both these points he has equally the advantage over you  Val  What in good manners too  Mr W  In every station they consist in treating all persons as our duty prescribes to us He does so in shewing a particular attachment and complaisance to you Do you do the same do you make a return of mildness and good will And yet he seems to merit them He is active and intelligent I believe him to be possest of goodnature spirit and good sense You ought to think  yourself very happy in having so amiable a companion with whom you may at once amuse and improve yourself His father is my fosterbrother and has always had a remarkable affection for me I am pretty sure that Michael has the same for you See how the poor little fellow hankers about the terracewalk to meet you Take care and use him with civility There is more honour and integrity in his father's cottage than in many palaces His family too has been our tenants for some generations and I should be glad to see the connexion continued between our children  He goes out  SCENE III  Valentine alone  Yes a fine connexion indeed I think papa is joking This little country boy teach me any thing No I will surprize him now so much with my learning that he will not think of talking to me of his own I'll warrant him  SCENE IV  Valentine Michael  Mich  You won't have my little nosegay then Master Valentine  Val  Nosegay Pshaw neither ranunculus nor tulip  Mich  Why it is true they are only field flowers but they are pretty and I thought you might like to know them by their names  Val  A great matter indeed to know the names of your herbs You may carry them where you found them  Mich  Well now if I had known that I would not have taken the trouble to gather them I was resolved not to go home yesterday evening without bringing you something and as I came back from work though it was rather late and I had a great mind for my supper I stopped in our close to gather them by the light of the moon  Val  You talk of the moon Do you know how big it is  Mich  Heh Fegs as big as a cheese  Val  Ignorant little clown  Struts with an air of importance while Michael stands staring at him  Look here  Showing him his book  This is Telemaque Have you ever read it  Mich  That is not in the Catechism our schoolmaster never talked to me about that  Val  No it is none of your country books  Mich  Nay how should I have read it then But let us see it  Val  Do not think of touching it with your dirty hands  Holding one of them up  Where did you buy these tanned leather gloves  Mich  Anan it is my hand Master Valentine  Val  The skin is so hard that one might cut it into shoe soles  Mich  It is not with idleness that they are grown so hard You know how to talk very well I dare say and yet I would not change conditions with you To work honestly and offend nobody is all that I know and it would be no harm if you knew as much Good bye sir  SCENE V  Valentine alone  I think the little clown had a mind to make game of me But I see company coming on the terracewalk I must put on a studious air before them  He sits down seeming to read in his book with great attention  SCENE VI  Mr and Mrs Waller Mr Ray Mr Nash Valentine seated on a bench on one side  Mr Wal  What a fine evening Would you chuse gentlemen to take a walk up this slope to see the sun setting  Mr Ray  I was going to mention it The weather is delicious and the sky perfectly without a cloud in the west  Mr Nash  I shall be sorry to go far from the nightingale Do you hear his charming melody madam  Mrs Wal  I was taken up with thinking My heart was filled with pleasure  Mr Ray  How can one live in town during this charming weather  Mr Wal  Valentine will you walk up the slope with us to see the sun setting  Val  No I thank you papa I am reading something here that gives me more pleasure  Mr Wal  If you speak truth I pity you and if you do notCome gentlemen there is not a moment to lose Let us continue our walk  They walk forward up the hill  SCENE VII  Valentine seeing them at a good distance  There they are almost out of sight I need not be under any constraint now  Puts the book into his pocket  What an opinion will these gentlemen have of my diligence I should like to be a bird and fly after them to hear the praises that they are giving me  Saunters about yawning and listless for near a quarter of an hour  I am tired after all of being here alone I can do better The sun is set now and I hear the company returning I will slip into the wood and hide myself in it so that they shall scarcely find me Mama will send all the servants to look for me with lights They will talk of nothing but me all the evening and will compare me with those great philosophers that have been known to go astray in their learned meditations and to lose themselves in woods My adventure will make a fine noise Now for it  He goes into the wood  SCENE VIII  Mr and Mrs Waller Mr Ray Mr Nash  Mr Ray  I never saw weather more pleasing nor a more charming scene  Mr Wal  Gentlemen my pleasure has been doubled by my enjoying it in your company  Mr Nash  The nightingale too still continues his song His voice seems even to grow more tender as night comes on I am sorry that Mrs Waller does not seem to listen to it with as much pleasure as before  Mrs W  It is because I am anxious about my son I do not see him in the garden  She calls him  Valentine He does not answer  Perceiving the gardener she calls him  Martin have you seen my son  Martin  Yes madam about ten minutes ago I saw him turn towards the grove  Mrs W  Towards the grove Bless me if he should lose himself Pray run after him and bring him in  Martin  Yes madam  Goes out  Mrs W  Mr Waller won't you go along with him  Mr W  No my dear I am not uneasy for my part Martin will be able to find him  Mrs W  But if he should take a different way I am frightened out of my wits  Mr Nash  Make yourself easy madam Mr Ray and I will take the two sides of the wood while the gardener shall take the middle We cannot fail of finding him so  Mrs W  Ah gentlemen I did not dare to ask it of you but you know the feelings of a mother  Mr W  Gentlemen do not give yourselves so much trouble I'd rather you would not  Mr Ray  You will not take it amiss that we comply with Mrs Waller's request rather than your's  Mr W  I must confess it is against my inclination  Mr Nash  We will receive your reproaches at our return  They walk towards the grove  SCENE IX  Mr and Mrs Waller  Mrs W  Why my dear whence comes this indifference about your son  Mr W  Do you think my dear that I love him less than you do No but I know better how to love him  Mrs W  And what if he could not be found  Mr W  I should be very glad of it  Mrs W  What that he should pass the night in a gloomy wood What would become of the poor child and what would become of me  Mr W  You would both be cured He of his vanity and you of your injudicious fondness which keeps it up in him  Mrs W  What do you mean my dear  Mr W  I am just now convinced of what I only suspected in the morning The boy's head is filled with excessive vanity and all his reading is but ostentation He has only lost himself on purpose to make us look for him and to appear absent and forgetful through intense study It gives me more pain that his mind should wander from a right way of thinking than if his steps really went astray He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time and there is nothing but a wholesome humiliation that can save him  Mrs W  But do you consider  Mr W  Yes everything He is eleven years old If he can profit any thing by his natural sense or his learning the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him sufficiently to clear the wood  Mrs W  But if he has not that thought  Mr W  He will then better see the necessity of profiting by the lessons that I have given him upon this subject Besides we intend him for the army and in that profession he will have many nights to pass without shelter He will know now what it is and not go to a camp quite raw to be laughed at by his companions Then the air is not very cold at this season of the year and for one night he will not die with hunger Since by his folly he has brought himself into a scrape let him get out of it again or suffer the disagreeable consequences of it  Mrs W  No I cannot agree to it and if you don't send people after him I will go myself  Mr W  Well my dear I will make you easy though I am sorry that you will not let me follow my plan as I intended I shall tell little Michael to join him as it were by chance Colin too shall be at a small distance in order to run to them in case of an accident For any thing more do not ask it I have taken my resolution and do not chuse by a blind weakness to deprive my son of a lesson that may be of service to him Here are our friends coming back with Martin  Mrs W  O heavens I see and they have not found him  Mr W  I am glad of it  SCENE X  Mr and Mrs Waller Mr Ray and Mr Nash  Mr Nash  Our search has been in vain but if Mr Waller will let us have some lights and servants  Mr W  No gentlemen you have complied with my wife's request you will now listen to mine I am a father and know my duty as one Let us go into the parlour and I will give you an account of my design  SCENE XI  The middle of the wood  Valentine  What have I done fool that I was It is dark night and I don't know which way to turn  Calls  Papa papa Nobody answers I am undone what will become of me  cries  O mama where are you Answer your son this once Heavens what is that running through the wood If it should be a robber Help help  SCENE XII  Valentine Michael  Michael  Who is there Who is it that cries so What is it you sir How do you happen to be here at this time of night  Valentine  O dear Michael my dear friend I have lost my way  Mich  looking at him first with an air of surprize and then bursting out in a laugh  You don't say so I your dear Michael your dear friend You mistake I am only a dirty little country boy Don't you remember Nay let go my hand The skin is only fit to cut up for shoe soles  Val  My dear friend excuse my impertinence and for pity's sake guide me back to our house My mama will pay you well  Mich  looking at him from top to bottom  Have you finished reading your Tellymack  Val  looking down quite confused  Ah pray now  Mich  putting his finger to the side of his nose and looking up  Tell me my little wise man how big may the moon be just now  Val  Nay spare me I beg of you and guide me out of this wood  Mich  You see then master that one may be a dirty little country boy and yet be good for something What would you give now to know your way instead of knowing how big the moon is  Val  I own my fault and I promise never to shew any pride for the future  Mich  Well that is clever But this same repenting by necessity may only hang by a thread It is not amiss that a young gentleman should see what it is to look upon a poor man's son like a dog and play with him according to his fancy But to shew you that an honest clown does not bear malice I will pass the night with you as I have passed many a one with our sheep on the downs Tomorrow morning early I will take you home to your papa Here then I'll share my bedchamber with you  Val  O my good Michael  Mich  stretching himself under a tree  Come sir settle yourself at your ease  Val  But where is this bedchamber of your's  Mich  Why here  Striking on the ground  Here is my bed take your place It is wide enough for us both  Val  What must we lie here under the open air  Mich  I assure you sir the king himself has not a better bed See what a fine cieling you have over your head how many bright diamonds adorn it and then our handsome silver lamp  Pointing to the moon  Well what do you think of it  Val  Oh my dear Michael I am ready to die with hunger  Mich  I dare say I can help you there too See here are some potatoes Dress them as you know how  Val  Why they are raw  Mich  It is only to boil or roast them Make a fire  Val  We want a light to kindle one and then where shall we find coal or wood  Mich  smiling  Why cannot you find all that in your books  Val  Oh no my dear Michael  Mich  Well then I'll shew you that I know more than you and all your Tellymacks  Takes a tinder box with flint and steel out of his pocket  Crack there is fire already now you shall see  He gathers a handful of dry leaves and putting them round the under sons with his hand until they take fire  We shall soon have a blazing hearth  He puts bits of dry wood upon the lighted leaves  Do you see  lays the potatees close to the fire and sprinkles them with dust  This must serve instead of ashes to hinder them from burning  Having laid them properly and covered them once more with dust he turns the fire over them then adds fresh wood and blows it up with his breath  Have you a finer fire in your papa's kitchen come now they will soon be done  Val  O my good friend what return can I make to your kindness  Mich  Return Pooh when one does good it pays itself But stop a moment While the potatoes are roasting I will fetch some hay for you I saw a good deal lying in one part of the wood You will sleep upon that like a prince But take care of the roast while I am away  Goes out singing  SCENE XIII  Valentine  Fool that I was how could I be so unjust as to despise this child What am I compared to him how little I am in my own eyes when I examine his behaviour and mine but it shall never happen again Henceforward I will not despise those of a lower condition than myself I will not be so proud nor so vain  He walks about and gathers up dry sticks for the fire  SCENE XIV  Valentine Michael hauling in a large bundle of hay  Mich  Here is your bed of down your coverlid and all I will make you a hed now quite soft  Val  I thank you my friend I would help you but I do not know how to set about it  Mich  I don't want you I can do it all alone Go warm yourself  He unties the bundle spreads part of it on the ground and reserves the rest for a covering  That is finished Now let us think of supper  Takes a potatoe from the fire and tastes it  They are done Eat them while they are warm they are better so  Val  What won't you eat some with me  Mich  No thank you There is just enough for you  Val  How Do you think  Mich  You are too kind I won't touch them I am not hungry Besides I shall have as much pleasure in seeing you eat them Are they good  Val  Excellent my dear Michael  Mich  I dare say you never tasted sweeter at your papa's table  Val  That is very true  Mich  Are you done Come then your bed is ready for you  Valentine lies down Michael spreads the rest of the hay over him then takes off his jacket  The nights are cold here cover yourself with this too If you find yourself chilly come to the fire I'll take care that it does not go out Good night  Val  Dear Michael I shall never be easy until I make you amends for my treating you ill  Mich  Think no more of it I do not The lark will awake us tomorrow morning at break of day  Valentine falls asleep and Michael sits up close by him to keep the fire in At break of day Michael awakes him  Come master you have slept enough The lark has opened her song already and the sun will soon appear behind the hill Let us set out and go to your papa's  Val  rubbing his eyes  What already so soon Good morning my dear Michael  Mich  Good morning Master Valentine How did you sleep  Val  rising  As sound as a rock Here is your jacket I thank you a thousand thousand times I shall never forget you as long as I live  Mich  Do not talk of thanks I am as happy as you Come walk along with me I'll guide you  They go off  SCENE XV  A room in Mr Waller's House Mr and Mrs Waller  Mrs W  In what terrors have I passed this whole night I fear my dear that some accident has happened to him We must send out people to look for him  Mr W  Make yourself easy my love I will go myself But who knocks  The door opens  Look here he is  SCENE XVI  Mr and Mrs Waller Valentine Michael  Mrs W  running to her son  Ah do I see thee again my dear child  Mich  Yes madam there he is ifegs a little better mayhap than before you lost him  Mr W  Is that the case  Val  Yes papa I have been well punished for my pride What will you give him that has reformed me  Mr W  A good reward and with the greatest chearfulness  Val  presenting Michael to him  Well this is he to whom you owe it I owe him my friendship too and he shall always share it  Mr W  If that is so I'll make him a little present every year of a couple of guineas for curing you of so intolerable a fault  Mrs W  And I will make him one of the same sum for having preserved my son to me  Mich  If you pay me for the satisfaction that you feel I should pay you too for what I felt So we are clear  Mr W  No my little man we shall not run from our words But let us go to breakfast all four Valentine shall relate his adventures of the night  Val  Yes papa and I shall not spare myself though I should be turned into ridicule for them I blush for my folly but hope that I shall never have to blush for the same behaviour again  Mr W  My dear son how happy you will make your mother and me by proving that your reformation is sincere and will never suffer a relapse  Valentine takes Michael by the hand Mr Waller gives his to his lady and they all go into the next apartment  THE PLEASURES OF WORK  Lady Stanfield  WHAT is the matter Viola You seem grieved  Viola  So I am mama  Lady Stan  At what my dear I thought to see you come back quite in spirits after your walk  Viola  My walk was pleasant at first but in coming home as I passed before our carpenter's house I saw his three children sitting at the door and crying most piteously They were starving with hunger  Lady Stan  How can that be Their father has a good trade and it is not a week since I paid him three guineas for work done about our house  Viola  So my governess told a woman one of the neighbours that came up to comfort the children and gave them some bread  Lady Stan  And what did she say  Viola  This poor man said she is much to be pitied He works night and day and is never the richer his wife manages so ill She knows nothing of housewifery She can neither sew nor spin nor knit and cannot even get up the family's linen If her husband wants a clean shirt he must have it washed and mended out of the house  Lady Stan  Sad management indeed and I do not wonder that you were grieved at finding a woman who does not perform any single duty of her sex I wish she may be the only one of that sort that you will ever meet  Viola  Ah mama this is not all As she can do nothing for her family nothing in the world idleness has led her to drinking When her husband after working hard thinks to have a good meal ready for him at his return home he finds his wife stretched upon the bed  intoxicated and very often his children have not a bit of bread to eat the whole day Don't you think those poor children much to be pitied  Lady Stan  I pity them as well as you my dear but on this disagreeable occasion you had an opportunity of making a remark that may be serviceable to you all your life  Viola  What is that mama  Lady Stan  That a woman who neglects the employments of her sex and condition is the most contemptible and unhappy creature in the world You may now perceive the reason why your papa and I constantly advise you to be doing something  Viola  Oh yes mama I see now how much you love me when you instruct me in my work But pray tell me have young ladies of fortune and quality any occasion to learn so many things When they are married have not they waiting women to do for them whatever they want  Lady Stan  My dear Viola work is as absolutely necessary for them as for the children of the poor Not to mention the reverses of fortune that may one day deprive a woman of every means of subsistence except the labour of her own hands and yet these reverses are common enough But in the highest rank of life amidst a crowd of servants ready at her call should not she herself know something of what work is in order to employ each one properly in his several way not to require of them more than they can perform to be able to recompense their diligence by making their service easy and thus to gain their attachment and respect Obliged by her rank and her wealth to employ a great number of tradesmen how will she be able without knowing what work is herself to set the proper value upon that of others by neither cutting short the fair demand of a useful tradesman nor yielding to the impositions of the vender of luxuries and fashionable toys and thus on the one hand indulge a generosity suitable to her birth and on the other guard against a useless expence  Besides what a pleasure for a sensible woman to see herself and her children clothed in the work of her own hands and to employ the savings of such oeconomy in relieving the sick and indigent and  bringing up their children so that they may in proper time maintain their parents  Viola  Ah pray don't let us lose a moment Teach me all that mama  Lady Stan  I will my dear that I may by so doing both perform my own duty and assist you to follow the dictates of nature and religion but particularly that I may save you from that dangerous dissipation which a habit of idleness may render agreeable and even necessary I will do it in order to make domestic retirement not unpleasing to you in order to make you yourself amiable in the eyes of your husband and respectable in those of your children in order to procure you hereafter a relief and amusement that may divert your attention from the evils of life which might otherwise affect you too forcibly and in fine to insure to you the tranquillity of a good conscience and to render you happy every moment of your life You have seen by the example of the carpenter's wife to what odious vices idleness may lead us But what think you of that vapourish unhappy listlessness the most insupportable torment to a woman I can give you perhaps a slight idea of it and proportioned to your understanding in the story of a little girl of your own age  Viola  O dear mama make haste let us have the little girl's story  Lady Stan  Then here it is "Mrs Friendly was always happy in being employed and never passed a quarter of an hour otherwise the whole day Angelica her daughter could hardly believe her when she talked to her of the satisfaction arising from industry and the disagreeable effects of doing nothing It is true she worked whenever her mother bid her for she was accustomed to obey but one may easily imagine how unhappy she was at her work as she never began it but with reluctance My dear child Mrs Friendly would often say to her when she saw her at work with her head hanging down and her hands in a careless posture I wish you may soon feel the tiresome languor that arises from having nothing to do and the satisfaction that one enjoys in being moderately employed This wish inspired by her affection was not long unaccomplished Angelica then about eleven years old was to go one day with her mother to a countryhouse  many miles off Mrs Friendly at her departure took her workbag with her and strongly recommended it to Angelica not to forget hers Angelica was willing to obey but how easily does one lose sight of a duty that is performed with reluctance The workbag was forgot Their journey at first was quite agreeable The weather was fine and all nature seemed to smile But about noon the clouds thickened round the horizon and the thunder rolled from one end of the sky to the other Their fright obliged them to stop at a small town where there was only one inn and immediately afterwards the rain came down in a flood As the approaching storm had forced a number of travellers to seek shelter in the inn Mrs Friendly and her daughter could not find a single room in it disengaged She therefore ordered the horses to be unharnessed and alighted at the house of a good old woman close by who very civilly resigned them her bedchamber and her bed the only one that she had How happy was Mrs Friendly that she had brought her work The good old woman sat beside her spinning at her wheel and between work and conversation the long summer's afternoon passed away without seeming tedious to them Poor Angelica was not very happy in the mean time The cottage was small and after she had visited every corner of it she had then absolutely nothing left to do The rain which still fell in great abundance did not allow her to set her foot out of doors the terrible noise of the thunder left her no desire for sleep and the conversation of the old woman who could talk of nothing but her work was not very likely to amuse her She begged her mama to let her have  her  work but Mrs Friendly told her very justly that she would not deprive herself of amusement for her that having taken care to bring with her something to employ herself it was but fair that she should enjoy the fruits of her attention and that she on the contrary should suffer for her negligence and forgetfulness Angelica could say nothing to reasons so forcible After many wearisome yawnings sighs of impatience and fruitless murmurs against the weather Angelica at length got to the end of the evening She eat a small supper without appetite and went to bed much out of humour with her jaunt How joyful did she rise at the  first summons of the sun who rose without a cloud With what eagerness did she hasten her mother's departure At last the carriage was ready and Mrs Friendly having generously rewarded the good old woman for her civility set forward again as well satisfied with her manner of passing the day before as Angelica was discontented with it The roads had lately been much broken up and the rain water which still covered them hindered the ruts from being observed The chaise jolted out of one hole into another the axle creaked and the glasses rattled at last a wheel broke down and the carriage was overthrown Happily Mrs Friendly and her daughter received no hurt They recovered from their fright by degrees and perceiving at a distance a little hamlet upon the side of a hill Mrs Friendly took her daughter by the hand and attended by her servant walked towards the hamlet intending to send assistance to her coachman There was in this place neither smith nor wheelwright so that they were obliged to wait almost two days for wheels from town as Mrs Friendly would travel in no other carriage but her own Poor Angelica how she cried how she lamented the tediousness of the time The fright of her fall had made such an impression on her as to deprive her of the use of her limbs so that she could not enjoy even the amusement of walking What could Mrs Friendly do to make her time less heavy The strict justice that she made a point of pursuing with her daughter forbad her to resign her own work to her besides Angelica had so neglected her improvement in needlework that she  ould have entirely spoiled it She then began to feel the value of employing one's self and blushing with shame said thus to her mother Ah mama I have well deserved what has happened to me and now for the first time see the reason why you always advised me so strongly to work I have sufficiently felt the wearisomeness of doing nothing She then threw herself into her mother's arms and hiding her face in her bosom I beg pardon mama for grieving you by my indolence I saw that you were troubled to see me fret But for your sake and my own I shall change my behaviour from this moment Mrs Friendly kissed her daughter praised her resolution and to strengthen the effect of Angelica's selftaught lesson  shewed her how a taste for work hinders our time from hanging heavy and softens the vexations of life by diverting our thoughts from them in an agreeable and salatary manner She blessed the accidents of a journey that had wrought so happy a change in her daughter  Angelica on the other hand kept her promise and even went beyond it so that Mrs Friendly never had reason to find fault with her afterwards unless for too great application  THE YOUNG SPARROWS  LITTLE Robert one day perceived a sparrow's nest under the eaves of the house and running immediately for his sisters to inform them of his discovery they all contrived together how to get the little covey into their possession It was agreed to wait until the young ones should be fledged that then Robert should raise a ladder against the wall and that his sister should hold it fast below while he climbed up for the nest When they thought the little birds sufficiently feathered they made ready to put their design in execution It succeeded perfectly and they found three young ones in the nest The old birds sent forth piteous cries on seeing their little ones whom they had nourished with so much care taken from them but Robert and his sisters were so overjoyed that they did not pay the least attention to their complaints  They were at first something puzzled what to do with their prisoners Augusta the youngest being of a mild and compassionate disposition was for having them put into a cage she promised to take the charge of them upon herself and to feed them regularly every day she described in a lively manner to her brother and sister the pleasure that they should have in seeing and hearing those young birds when grown big This was opposed by Robert he maintained that it was better to pluck them just as they were and that it would be much more  funny  to look at them jumping about in the room without feathers than to see them dismally shut up in a cage Charlotte the eldest declared herself of the same opinion as Augusta but Robert persisted in his own  At last the two little girls seeing that their brother would not give up the point and that besides he had the nest in his possession agreed to whatever he desired But he had not waited for their consent to begin his execution The first was already plucked There is one stript says he setting it on the ground In a moment all the little family were deprived of their tender feathers The poor things cried  peep peep  and complained very piteously they shuddered with the cold and shook their bare little wings But Robert instead of pitying their sufferings did not end his persecutions there he pushed them with his toe to make them go on and whenever they tumbled over the burst out a laughing and at last his sisters joined in the laugh with him  While they were indulging this cruel amusement they saw at a distance their tutor coming towards them Mum Each pocketed a bird and was slinking off "Well cried their tutor to them where are you going Come hither" This order obliged them to stop They advanced slowly with their eyes fixed on the ground  The Tutor  Why do you run away at my coming  Rob  We were only playing  The Tutor  You know I do not debar you of amusement and indeed I am never so happy as when I see you all merry  Rob  We were afraid that you were coming to scold us  The Tutor  Do I ever scold you for taking an innocent diversion I see you have done something amiss Why have you each your hand in your pocket I must know the reason Shew me each your hand and what you have in it  They show each their hand with a bird plucked  The Tutor  with an emotion of pity and indignation  And who could give you the idea of treating these poor little creatures thus  Rob  Why it is so droll to see sparrows jump without feathers  The Tutor  You think it very droll to see innocent creatures suffer and to hear their cries when in pain  Rob  No sir I did not think it put them to pain  The Tutor  Did'nt you Come hither I will convince you it did  He plucks a few hairs out of Robert's head  Rob  Oh Oh  The Tutor  Does that hurt you  Rob  Do you think it does not to pluck one's hairs  The Tutor  Pshaw there are only a dozen  Rob  But that is too much  The Tutor  What would it be then were one to pluck out all your hair so Have you a notion of the pain that you would feel And yet you have put these birds to the very same torture though they never did you any harm And you young ladies you that should be more tenderhearted did you suffer this  The two little misses were standing by silent but hearing these last words and feeling the keenness of the rebuke they sat down with their eyes swimming in tears The tutor remarking their sorrow was touched with it and said no more to them  Robert did not cry and endeavoured to justify himself thus I could not think that I did them any harm They sung all the while and they clapped their wings as if they were pleased  The Tutor  Do you call their cries singing But why should they sing  Rob  I suppose to call their father and mother  The Tutor  No doubt And when their cries should have brought them what did the young ones mean to tell them by clapping their wings  Rob  I cannot say exactly perhaps to ask their help  The Tutor  Just so Therefore if those birds could have expressed themselves in our speech you would have heard them cry "Ah father and mother save us We have unhappily fallen into the hands of cruel children who have plucked all our feathers We are cold and in pain Come warm us and cure us or we shall die"  The little girls could hold out no longer they sobbed and hid their faces in their handkerchiefs It was you Robert that led us to this cruelty We hated the thought of it ourselves Robert was then himself sensible of his fault He had already been punished by his tutor plucking his hair he was now much more so by the reproaches of his own heart The tutor thought there was no occasion to add to this double punishment It was not indeed from an instinct of cruelty but purely from want of thought that Robert had done this illnatured action and the pity which he selt from that moment for all creatures  weaker than himself opened his heart to the sentiments of kindness and humanity that have animated him all the rest of his life  THE TWO APPLETREES  ARich husbandman had two sons the one exactly a year older than the other The very day the second was born he had set in the entrance of his orchard two young appletrees equal in size which he had since cultivated with the same care and which had thriven so equally that nobody could give the preference to either of them before the other When his children were capable of handling garden tools he took them one fine spring day to see those two trees which he had planted for them and called by their names and after they had sufficiently admired their fine growth and the number of blossoms that covered them he said "You see children I give you these trees in good condition They will thrive as much by your care as they will lose by your negligence and their fruit will reward you in proportion to your labour"  The youngest named Edmund was indefatigable in his attention He was all day busy in clearing his tree of insects that would have hurt it and he propped up its stem to hinder it from taking an ugly bent He loosened the earth all round it that the warmth of the sun and the moisture of the dews might cherish its roots His mother had not tended him more carefully in his infancy than he did his young appletree  His brother Moses did none of all this He spent his time on a mount that was hard by throwing stones from it at passengers in the road He went amongst all the little country boys in the neighbourhood to box with them so that he was always seen with broken shins and black eyes from the blows and kicks that he received in his quarrels He neglected his tree so far in short that he never once thought of it till one day in autumn he by chance saw Edmund's tree so full of apples streaked with purple and gold that were it not for the props which  supported its branches the weight of its fruit must have bent it to the ground Struck with the fight of so fine a growth he ran to his own hoping to find as large a crop on it but what was his surprize when he saw nothing but branches covered with moss and a few yellow leaves Quite angry and jealous he went to his father and said "Father what sort of a tree is this that you have given me It is as dry as a broomstick and I shall not have ten apples on it But my brotherOh you have used him better Bid him at least share his apples with me" "Share with you said his father so the industrious would lose his laber to feed the idle Take what you get it is the reward of your negligence and do not think to accuse me of injustice when you see your brother's rich crop Your tree was as fruitful and in as good order as his It bore as many blossoms and grew in the same soil only it had not the same usage Edmund has kept his tree clear of even the smallest infects you have suffered them to eat up yours in its blossom As I do not chuse to let any thing which God has given me and for which I hold myself accountable to him go to ruin I take this tree from you again and call it no more by your name It must pass through his hands to recover itself and is his property from this moment as well as the fruit that he shall make it bear You may go and look for another in my nursery and rear it if you will to make amends for your fault but if you neglect it that too shall belong to your brother for assisting me in my labour"  Moses felt the justice of his father's sentence and the wisdom of his design He went that moment and chose in the nursery the most thriving young appletree that he could find Edmund assisten him with his advice in rearing it and Moses did not lose a moment He was never out of humour now with his comrades and still less with himself for he applied chearfully to work and in autumn he saw his tree fully answer his hopes Thus he had the double advantage of enriching himself with a plentiful growth of fruit and at the same time of getting rid of the vicious habits that he had contracted  His father was so well pleased with this change that the following year he shared the produce of a small orchard between him and his brother  IF MEN DO NOT SEE YOU GOD SEES YOU  MR Ferguson was walking in the country one fine warm day in harvest time with his youngest son Frank Papa said Frank looking wistfully towards a garden by the side of which they were walking I am very dryAnd I too my dear answered Mr Ferguson but we must have patience until we go home  Frank  There is a peartree loaded with very fine fruit they are Windsor pears Ah with what pleasure I could eat one  Mr Ferg  I do not doubt it but that tree is in a private garden  Frank  The hedge is not very thick and here is a hole where I can easily get through  Mr Ferg  And what would the owner of the garden say if he should be there  Frank  Oh he is not there I dare say and nobody can see us  Mr Ferg  You mistake child There is one who sees us and who would punish us and justly too because it would be wicked to do what you propose  Frank  Who is that papa  Mr Ferg  He who is every where present who never loses sight of us a moment and who sees to the very bottom of our thoughts that is God  Frank  Ah it is very true I shall not think of it any more  Just then a man stood up behind the hedge whom they could not see before because he had been sitting down on a grassy slope It was an old man the owner of the garden who spoke thus to Frank "Return thanks to God my child that your father hindered you from stealing into my garden and coming to take what does not belong to you Know that at the foot of each tree there is a trap laid to catch thieves where you would certainly have been caught and perhaps have lamed yourself for ever But since at the first word of the prudent lesson given you by your father you have shewed a fear of God and did no longer insist on the theft that you intended I  will give you with pleasure some of the fruit that you wished to taste" At these words he went up to the finest peartree shook it and brought back his hat full of pears to Frank  Mr Ferguson would have taken money out of this purse to pay this civil old man but could not prevail on him to accept any "I have had a satisfaction sir in obliging your son which I should lose were I to be paid for it God alone repays such actions"  Mr Ferguson shook hands with him over the hedge and Frank thanked him too in a very manly manner but he shewed a still more lively gratitude in the hearty appetite that he appeared to have for the pears which did indeed quite run over with juice That is a very good man said Frank to his papa after he had finished the last and they had got a good distance from the old man  Mr Ferg  Yes my dear and he is so no doubt because his heart is convinced of this great truth that God never fails to reward good actions and chastise evil  Frank  Would God have punished me then if I had taken the pears  Mr Ferg  The good old man told you what would have happened to you God my dear child orders every thing that passes upon earth and directs events so as to reward good people for their virtuous actions and to punish the wicked for their crimes I will tell you an adventure which relates to this subject and made so strong an impression on me when a child that I shall never forget it as long as I live  Frank  Ah papa how happy I am today a pleasant walk fine pears and a story besides  Mr Ferg  When I was as little as you and lived at my father's we had two neighbours the one on the right the other on the lefthand of our house their names were Dobson and Vicars Mr Dobson had a son called Simon and Mr Vicars one also of the name of Gamaliel Behind our house and those of our neighbours were small gardens separated at that time only by quickset hedges Simon when alone in his father's garden amused himself with throwing stones into all the gardens round about never once thinking that he might hurt somebody Mr Dobson had observed this and reprimanded him severely for it threatening to chastise him if  ever he did so again But unhappily this child knew not or else did not believe that one should not do amiss even when alone because God is always near us and sees whatever we do One day when his father was gone out thinking that nobody could see him and therefore that he should not be punished he filled his pocket with stones and began pelting them all round him Just at the same time Mr Vicars was in his garden with his son Gamaliel This boy had the misfortune to think as well as Simon that it was enough not to do amiss before others and that when alone one might do what one pleased His father had a gun charged to shoot the sparrows that came picking his cherries and he was sitting in a summerhouse to watch them At this moment a servant came to tell him that a strange gentleman wanted him in the parlour he therefore left the gun in the summerhouse and expressly forbid Gamaliel to touch it But Gamaliel when all alone said to himself "I dont see what harm there would be in playing with this gun a little" and saying thus he took it up and began to exercise with it like a soldier He handled his arms and rested his firelock and had a mind to try if he could make ready and present The muzzle of his gun happened to be pointed towards Mr Dobson's garden and just as he was going to shut the left eye in order to take aim a pebble stone thrown by Simon struck him in that very eye The fright and the pain together made Gamaliel drop the gun which went off and oh what cries and shrieks were immediately heard in both gardens Gamaliel had received a blow of a stone in the eye and Simon received the whole charge of the gun in his leg Thus the one lost his eye and the other remained a cripple all the rest of his life  Frank  Ah poor Simon poor Gamaliel how I pity them  Mr Ferg  They were it is true very much to be pitied but their parents still more so for having children so disobedient and vicious After all it was a real happiness for these two bad boys to have met with this accident  Frank  How so papa  Mr Ferg  I will tell you If God had not early punished these children they would always have continued  in mischief whenever they found themselves alone whereas they experienced by this warning that whatever bad actions men do not see God sees and punishes This was therefore a lesson to them to amend themselves and they became thenceforth prudent and sedate and shunned doing mischief when alone as much as if all the world saw them And this indeed was the design of Providence in thus punishing them for our merciful Creator never chastises us but to make us become better  Frank  Well that eye and leg will make me take care I will shen what is wrong and do what is right even though I see nobody near me  As he had finished these words they arrived at their own housedoor  THE GOOD SON  A DRAMA in Two ACTS  The following is rather an  imitation or paraphrase than a translation of the drama which bears the same titi  in

without seeing her What can have happened Every thing is quiet in the house Ah Cicely can you sleep at ease while you know how uneasy I am  Mayhap she has changed her mind and loves somebody else  Goes towards the cottage door  Heh Cicely Cicely  SCENE II  Isaac Cicely  Cic  mimicking him  Heh Isaac IsaacWell here I am  Isaac  You seem to be in high spirits Cicely  Cic  Are you angry that I am glad to see you  Isaac  You did not want to see me yesterday though or you would have been where you promised  Cic  Well are you going to scold me Do you think I was not as uneasy as you were  Isaac  Dear heart Cicely are you serious Well now I am as happy as I was dull a minute ago But what hindered you to come  Cic  You know it was the first day of the month and when my brother at his landing wrote to father from Portsmouth he told him that he should hear from him again without fail as yesterday  Isaac  Well  Cic  So father would not wait for the postman but sent me about four o'clock to the postoffice for the letter They told me there to wait that it could not be long before the coach came in so I staid upon thorns And father uneasy at my stop came soon afterwards and before a quarter of an hour's end comes mother too You know I could not quit them So there we staid until dark night and no coach I suppose some accident had happened We came back sorrowful enough and I could not leave father and mother grieving by themselves now tell me could I  Isaac  No you are very right I shan't scold you But what is your hurry now Where do you want to go  Cic  To see if the letter is come yet Father and mother are terribly uneasy They are so fond of my brother and he of them  Isaac  Now Cicelyare you fond of me  Cic  My brother that was only a private soldier and is now a

is a fine thing Isaac to be a captain Dost not think so  Isaac  Ay I shall know it I am afraid He'll be ashamed now mayhap to see me one of his family as I have no gold shoulderknot nor men at my command  Cic  No Isaac do not make yourself uneasy My father has lived in the same way of life with you these sixty years and my brother has too much sense to despise it He would have been the same as you if he had not chanced to enlist when he was young No he will never look for a husband for his sister out of her own condition  Isaac  Ah Cicely how happy you make me  SCENE III  Jeremy Cicely Isaac  Jer  Are you come back already Where is the letter Let's see  Cic  Father I have not been at the postoffice yet  Jer  And you stand there prating  Cic  I was just a going Well I'll run as fast

shall Ah I am sure I pray for that every day  Nanny  He is a soldier my good man and a soldier is not certain of his life a moment That is what makes me unhappy Very often when his letters are rend to us and you imagine that I cry for joy it is for grief and sorrow Each I think is perhaps his last and this money that he sent us at his landing I cannot look at it without a heavy sigh As I said to myself it is his pay from the king the price of his blood and can we his father and mother be happy while we are spending it Ah I wish he were here now  Jer  We shall have him here by and by never fear He will come to quarter in some town mayhap near ourselves and then we shall go and see him once a week  Nanny  overjoyed  Aye twice three times a week my man Ah if that was the case how happy should I be But who can tell whether we shall know him again  Jer  Heh I dare say I shall know my own son  Nanny  What when he is drest like an officer all over gold lace with his breastplate and his swash  SCENE VI  Jeremy Nanny Boniface  Bon  Good morrow neighbour Jeremy Good morrow dame Goodacre  Jer  How dost do Master Boniface  shaking him by the hand  Bon  Well you have received news from your son Where is the letter Let me read it to you  Jer  We have not received it yet and I am so impatient  Bon  I suppose so if it were only to have the honour of receiving a letter from a lieutenant But how the plague did he get up so high I cannot think for my part Besides you never shewed me his letter that mentions it you got the exciseman to read it for you  Nanny  Then you did not hear that

he could  with vehemence  led them up to the enemy fell on with fixed bayonets checked them so much that our people had time to retreat and at last came off in good order at the head of fifty men His general saw the whole made him lieutenant upon the spot and promised to befriend him as long as he lived Yes master Boniface it is all true My son did just as I tell you  Bon  Oh it is a brave youth I saw that long ago while he was at school with me When my boys were at play it was Charley that led the gang and if ever there was a quarrel he always sobered the stoutest of them It was in him then neighbour Jeremy That is all natural to him  Jer  laughing  Aye by the mass is it  SCENE VII  Jeremy Nanny Cicely Boniface  Cic  running  Father father here is the letter here it is and another

Then he will not cross the seas again How happy my wife will be  Bon  "I hope shortly to have the happiness of seeing my family"  Jer  Oh I knew we should soon have him here  Bon  "Meantime I cannot give you greater satisfaction than by informing you how honourably I have been treated a few days since"  Jer  joyfully  Ay Let us hear let us hear  Bon  "By the general who politely invited me to dinner with him"  Jer  My Charley to dine with him Oh how the rest would stare all those great officers Well well  Bon  "He held a particular conversation with me for a long time and was pleased to pay me several compliments on my behaviour during the war which were certainly more than I deserved In short he asked me where I was born and who was my father"  Jer  What the general ask about me Well what did he say let's hear quick Master Boniface  Bon  "I told him that you were a poor honest labouring man but that I would not change you for any father in the world notwithstanding your condition"  Jer  lifting up his hands  Heavenly goodness I think I hear him  Bon  "The general was pleased with this expression of my duty towards you and filling his glass drank your health in the presence of the whole table requesting me to inform you that he had done himself that pleasure and to assure you alway of his friendship and good wishes"  Jer  overjoyed  Now is it possible Master Boniface The general Some duke no doubt  Bon  Ay you hear he drank your health  Jer  runs towards the cottage and calls out  Wife wife never mind what you are doing there but come hither come quick  Nanny from within the cottage  What is the matter Jeremiah  Jer  Nay come you shall hear come I tell you quick  SCENE IX  Jeremy Boniface Nanny  Jer  kissing Nanny  Oh my dear good wife what a son

Oh better than that He dined with the general d'ye know and the general asked about our town and about me and my son told him that I was a poor labourer but that he would not change me for all the fathers in the world And with that the general drank my health publickly and promised me his friendship  Nanny claps her hands for joy  So now my dear we must drink the general's health Come dame take

Hark ye neighbour Boniface you must write for me to my son as how I have pledged the general's health in a bumper and that he must thank him from me and assure him that I love him dearly Now don't forget Nay by the rights of the business it would not be amiss I think to send a civil line or two to himself  Bon  Pooh neighbour Jeremy what dost talk on  Nanny  But Charley is coming home is he we

Jer  hand over his eyes  Not yet honey the sun    Nanny  I hope all this joy may not be out of season Step down and lend me a hand to get up I shall see farther than you  Jer  What a dust Is it a

SCENE IV  Jeremy Nanny Lieutenant Goodacre  Lieut Goodacre entering as Jeremy comes down from the hill  My dear father  embraces his father and mother  Jer  Ah my good son God bless thee my dear boy The sight of you makes me shed tears of joy You have a thankful father  Nanny  Oh that you have my dear child and a thankful mother too  Lieut Goodacre  Why do you talk of thanks my honoured parents It is I that have obligations to you  Jer  No Charles I will say it before all the world you have repaid me much more than I have ever given you You are all my comfort and the happiness of my old age It is you that keep me alive and prolong my days  Nanny  We can never make you amends for the happiness that you afford us  Lieut Goodacre  And is it not the greatest happiness that I can enjoy myself It would be none if your affection did not make you share it with me Yes my dear and honoured parents I have never ceased to think of you in every circumstance of life When any good fortune has happened to me I have thought very little of the advantage that fell to myself from it The greatest pleasure that I felt at such times was in thinking of the satisfaction that it would occasion to you But in no part of my life have I enjoyed so great so sensible a happiness as at this moment when I see both your eyes filled with tears  taking each of them by the hand and looking at them by turns  O my worthy parents I can never satisfy myself with seeing youBut compose yourselves I cannot stay very long with you now I shall return shortly and spend a few days with you Well how do you go on How do you pass your old age How do you live Where is my sister that I have not seen  she was in her cradle Let me see her  Jer  She is a good girl and gives us vash satisfaction We are going to marry her

been trapanned by a serjeant that luckily is still here Before he releases him he expects two guineas and they have been promised to him to keep him on the spot as we were in hopes that you would come in the mean time How happy it is that you arrived here today  Lieut Goodacre  Well go father and try to bring him hither without telling him that I am here nor my sister neither  Jer  Nay how shall I refrain I would much rather cry out to every body that I meet He is here he is here  goes out  SCENE V  Nanny Lieutenant Goodacre  Lieut Goodacre  looking round him  How charming is this retreat Now indeed I know the place of my birth Yonder is the cottage that I have so often sighed after There the great tree under the shade of which we used to sit with our neighbours on fine summer evenings and here the hill that I chose for the scene of my sports O happy years of my childhood Of every spot that I see round me there is none my dear mother that does not remind  me mark or other of your affection But you  though    Nanny  My joy is so great I can hardly give it vent If I  ere alone I could cry for an hour Besides too I think  Lieut Goodacre  What my dear mother  Nanny  That you are not our equal now You are too much above us  Lieut Goodacre  I too much above you Oh banish that though Are not the  of nature the most sacred Am not I convinced that I cannot be dearer to any persons upon earth th  n to you and my father And should not I in return fell a more sincere affection to my parents than to any other person in the universe Ah believe me I shall continue to love and respect you the same as ever  SCENE VI  Nanny Lieutenant Goodacre Cicely  Cic  enters hastily to her mother without observing Lieutenant Goodacre  What is the matter mother Why did my father send me here in such a hurry  perceiving Lieutenant Goodacre she draws back  Oh goodness an officer  Lieut Goodacre  aside to Nanny  Mother is that my sister  Nanny makes signs to him in the affirmative He goes to kiss her  What a charming countenance  Cic  struggling  Oh fye sir be quiet  Nanny  What Cicely to your brother  Lieut Goodacre  How surprized she seems Yes Cicely your brother and I hope a brother that you love  Cic  Dear mother what this fine officer Is he my brother Charley  Lieut Goodacre  kissing her  What amiable innocence  Cic  running to her mother quite overjoyed  Oh mother we have nothing to fear now Isaac will soon be released  SCENE VII  Jeremy Nanny Lieutenant Goodacre Boniface Cicely Isaac the Serjeant Country People  Jer  pointing to his son  There serjeant there is the gentleman that will pay you the two guineas  The Serj  surprized  How is this an officer  takes off his hat  Lieut Goodacre  You say sir that you have enlisted this man where is your beating order  The Serj  presenting it to him with some confusion  Here sir  Lieut Goodacre  I see the number of your corps What officer commands your party  The Serj  Captain Marshall sir  Lieut Goodacre having looked over the paper  Why this is but a copy Well I know your captain and think I should know you too Your dealing with this man does not seem to have been fair I am afraid that you have  abused the honourable profession of a soldier and looked upon it as allowing you a privilege to extort poor people's money I shall write to your captain and meantime shall be answerable for this man's appearance  Serjeant goes off  SCENE VIII  Jeremy Nanny Lieutenant Goodacre Boniface Cicely Isaac Country People  Lieut Goodacre  Come hither sister Is this your intended spouse He is a clever young fellow I like Cicel's  very much  Isaac  You are very good captain to approve it as I am no more than  bandman  Lieut Goodacre  And what was my father Are not you born of honest parents  Nanny  Yes indeed my dear son as honest as any in the purish  Lieut Goodacre  Well I shall not be happy unless I am at your wedding I shall take all the expence of it upon myself  Country People  with a  of approbation  That is very generous indeed  Lieut Goodacre  But do not I see Mr Boniface  Bon  Yes captain much at your service  Lieut Goodacre  Ah one of my cl  est acquaintances  shaking hands with him  I am sorry to have made him angry  often so m  rly  Bon  That  The present does me much honour Do  it was I who read all your letters  good  I have spread your reputation  country Indeed I came in  me  of

am heartily obliged to you my good friends  Country People  approaching familiarly  How plain he is and how affable He does not think himself above us Kindly welcome home captain We have always been glad to hear news from you when you were abroad  Lieutenant Goodacre takes each of them by the hand  Jer  Every thing that I see of you my dear son pleases me highly and convinces me that whatever I heard to your advantage was true You certainly have behaved yourself as a worthy soldier  Lieut Goodacre  I hope so father and I am indebted for it to your good advice and that of my mother There is no part of the world I thank heaven where my memory is hateful I flatter myself that in many parts it is respected  looking at his watch  But my time is almost expired I must leave you my dear parents  Nanny  What already so soon  Jer  Stop a little longer We have scarcely had time to look at you  Lieut Goodacre  I must absolutely join our division again Be assured that my heart alone would be sufficient to keep me here if my duty did not call me away But shall I ask you one thing before I leave you  Jer and Nanny  Any thing child any thing  Lieut Goodacre  Well then my dear parents come and live with me You shall command my pay such as it is in the same manner as you ever command my duty and affection  Jer and Nanny  My dear son  Lieut Goodacre  You hesitate Ah your consent must be quite voluntary It would be no happiness to me if it ceased to be one to you  Jer  Hear me my dear child We are old and cannot live long Let us die here where we have spent all our days Let us die in our cottage that spot is dear to us since in it you was born Only come and make us happy with the sight of you now and then it is all that we desire  Lieut Goodacre  Oh certainly certainly father  Nanny  And we my dear son will go to see you in return They will be days of happiness to us when we see you and we shall never cease to bless heaven for having given us such a son  PHYSIOGNOMY  MR Oakley having one day surprized his daughter Arabella very busy before her glass they had the following conversation on the subject  Mr Oakley  Why Arabella you are drest very fine I suppose it is to receive or to pay visits  Arabella  Yes papa I am to spend the evening with the Miss Monktons  Mr Oakley  I thought you were going to figure in a circle of duchesses What needs all this dressing for friends that you see every day  Arabella  Why papa you knowwhen one goes out one should not be in a dishabille as at home  Mr Oakley  Then you are generally in dishabille at home  Arabella  No papabut you know there ought to be a difference  Mr Oakley  I understand You mean that you should be a little more attentive to your dress But I thought as I came in that you seemed busy in examining your looks and your figure Does your glass tell you that your studies have succeeded  Arabella tooks down and blushes  What is your intention  Arabella  Papa one always likes to please andwe would not appear so as to frighten people  Mr Oakley  Ha ha then it depends on our choice to please people or to frighten them  Arobella  Not entirely But I meantas others do when they say one looks like a fright  Mr Oakley  I should like to know what that means It may be of use to myself  Arabella  Why for instance when one is pitted deeply with the smallpox or has a great long nose and chin or a wide mouth  Mr Oakley  Thank heaven you have none of these but rather indeed a sensible little countenance What more do you want in order to please universally and not to be a fright  Arabella  Ah I can't tell how it is but I know some little misses that have very handsome faces and yet they do not please me and I know other that are not counted handsome and yet I like their faces very much  Mr Oakley  Can you trust me with your thoughts Tell me those first that are handsome and yet have not the good luck to please your taste  Arabella  That is easily done In the first place there is Miss Bloomer She has a clear smooth skin as white as a lily with fine blue eyes and rosy lips But she has an affected loll which makes her seem lower than she is and she hangs her head on one shoulder so that her face looks quite another thing Then she draws out her words slowly as if she weighed each syllable and in speaking she looks at you expecting you to admire every sentence In the next place there is the eldest Miss Archly she passes for a beauty but her looks are so proud and sneering that when we are a number of us together we cannot help thinking she despises or ridicules us As for Miss Drake she carries herself with so much confidence and speaks with such an air of command that a boy would blush  Mr Oakley  Softly At this rate we shall fall into scandal I would rather hear you mention those who without being handsome have found means to please you  Arabella  You know Miss Emily Johnson She is much marked with the smallpox and even has a pearl on her left eye from it but yet her countenance is so pleasing that one may read in it goodnature mildness and complaisance The youngest Miss Archly has the smallest cast in the world with her eyes from having had something hung before one eye that was sore for almost a twelvemonth when she was young She looks to the right to see what is on her left hand Well it is nothing when one becomes used to it and we all love her dearly she is so lively and so gay  Mr Oakley  You seen then outward advantages such as a fair soft skin white teeth a handsome nose rosy lips a fine easy shape in short all the beauties of face or  person are not sufficient by themselves to make one please one must have besides a happy countenance and engaging manners  Arabella  Certainly papa for otherwise I cannot tell how some please me who are neither handsome nor well shaped and how others are disagreeable with all these advantages  Mr Oakley  But can you tell why the first have something in their countenances more agreeable to us than the regular features of the second  Arabella  Because I should think one sees there some figns of their disposition and we are apt to think that those who have an appearance of goodnature in the features of the face must have a good heart  Mr Oakley  When you were before your glass you strove no doubt to throw a little goodnature into your countenance that people might imagine you to possess it in your disposition too  Arabella  Oh pray papa do not make game of me  Mr Oakley  I do not mean it But you told me just now that you wished to please and you owned this to be the surest method of doing so  Arabella  Yes certainly  Mr Oakley  But do you think that such a countenance may not be deceitful or that one can assume the power of pleasing and lay it down at pleasure  Arabella  Yes papa I think so for I have heard you and others say a hundred times "I would never have thought that little girl to have such a deceitful countenanceThat man looked like honesty itself and yet he has deceived usSuch a person knows how to compose his face so that one would swear him to be possest of every virtue"  Mr Oakley  But did we speak then of those that we had seen often or for a long time or pretty near us  Arabella  Ah I do not know that papa  Mr Oakley  Or might not this wrong judgment proceed from a want of sagacity or from not sufficiently remarking whether such persons have always the same countenance or only take it up upon occasion or in short whether they speak and act consistently and uniformly  Arabella  What is the meaning of that papa  Mr Oakley  Whether every thing agrees their countenance their eyes the sound of their voice all the features of their face whether any part contradicts or gives the lie to the other  Arabella  Oh there are a good many things to mind in that And yet I should imagine if I saw any one a long time and pretty often and took particular notice of what you have mentioned I could not be mistaken  Mr Oakley  Ah child do not be too sure  Arabella  However I think I can see in my little friends what is affected and what is natural  Mr Oakley  So then you suppose that you are knowing enough in the art of disguising the thoughts and that you have judgment and penetration enough to distinguish truth from hypocrisy upon a countenance Really I should never have expected so much from so light a little head as yours  Arabella  Oh I have taken notice in Miss Bloomer that her prim mouth her stare her motions with her head and that drawling tone of hers are not natural and that the elder Miss Archly's proud flouting look and Miss Drake's free undaunted manner is not at all affected because the one is really vain and selfconceited and the other impudent  Mr Oakley  Perhaps they are not far enough advanced in the art of putting on counterfeit looks However your opinion is that our aversions and our likings our faults and our virtues are painted on our faces and that one can read in a person's features as in a book what he is in the bottom of his heart  Arabella  Why not I never saw a passionate person with a mild aspect nor an envious person with a smiling countenance nor one who was cruel and unfeeling with looks of tenderness Only see our neighbour Mrs Grimston how she eyes people as if she would eat them up and with what a grumbling voice she speaks Every time that Miss Artichoke the old maid comes here when mama has company only observe how her eyes go round to see if any lady present has any thing new or elegant about her dress and with what looks of jealousy she measures her from head to foot as if she was hurt at another's happiness  Mr Oakley  Why indeed we may pretty safely pronounce that the one is envious and the other passionate But may it not sometimes happen that nature should give the same person a happy countenance and a perverse disposition or on the other hand indifferent features along with a noble heart  Arabella  I do not know but I can hardly believe it  Mr Oakley  Why so  Arabella  Because we may see by a person's figure whether he is weak or strong sickly or in health and it must be the same with the disposition  Mr Oakley  Well now I shall give you two passages from history that seem to contradict your notion A certain able physiognomist called Zopyrus boasted that from a view of a person's shape and countenance he could distinguish his manners and ruling passions After one day looking at Socrates he judged him to be a man of a bad mind and vicious inclinations some of which he mentioned Alcibiades the friend and scholar of Socrates who was well acquainted with his master's merit could not help laughing at the judgment of the physiognomist and taxing him with gross ignorance But Socrates confessed that he was really by nature inclined to those vices of which he was accused and that he preserved himself free from them by the constant exertions of philosophy Aesop that slave who was endowed with so much wit had a person so disagreeable and deformed that when he stood to be sold he could prevail on nobody to purchase him until his witty answers shewed them convincingly what he wasHere are two examples that seem to prove the contrary of what you maintained  Arabella  Well now that surprizes me as to Socrates I have often heard you talk of him with admiration And as to Aesop too I have read his fables with so much pleasure I should have thought them both the finest looking persons in the world But however it agrees again with what I said that one may be ordinary and yet have I don't know what of wit sensibility or goodnature in the countenance  Mr Oakley  You are right sickness or grief may alter the features But that was not the case with Socrates He owned himself that he was at first viciously inclined and the features of his face strongly confirmed it  Arabella  I think his answer explains the difficulty He was born with a bad disposition but as he had much good sense at the same time and saw that passion pride and envy were terrible vices he struggled with them and came at length to get the better of them His heart was purged of his faults but his countenance kept the marks of them still  Mr Oakley  You seem to be pretty ready at a reply Nay there is some truth too in your reasoning However I have a small question to propose to youIf Miss Archly that proud little miss who has a face you say expressing disdain and selfconceit should from the sensible instructions of her parents be convinced of her own folly or if distresses and sickness obliged her to endeavour to render herself agreeable to others by being mild affable and mannerly so that she should become quite the contrary to what she is at present and suppose it were the same with your other little friends as to the faults that you find in them also would those marks of pride affectation or impudence remain still upon their faces Or when by continual and redoubled efforts they should have changed their vices into the opposite virtues would the same alteration take place in their countenances  Arabella  Yes certainly papa  Mr Oakley  Well the truth may lie between our different ways of arguing Socrates when young yielded to the folly of his passions and even retained for a long time his choleric temper since he entreated his friends to admonish him whenever they saw him ready to give way to it But in a more advanced age when he had been instructed in the school of wisdom he began undoubtedly to combat his vices to reform himself daily and to rise by degrees to the highest pitch of perfect on in every moral virtue But then it was too late to newmodel his features The muscles and fibres of his face becoming stiff the beauty of his mind could make no impression through his countenance It was like the sun in a cloudy sky Now in childhood when the features are more tender and flexible the different movements of the soul are in their turns forcibly impressed on them So that if by a reform during that period the virtues take place of the vices in the mind the outward expression of these virtues on the countenance will also efface that of the vices For  the countenance may be compared to a thin veil If you throw it over the head of a fair Circassian and afterwards over that of a Negro wench you will easily see through it the florid bloom of the one and the sooty blackness of the other I do not know whether you understand what I mean  Arabelia  Oh yes perfectly from that comparison and to shew you that I do I will give you one of my own I have often with the greatest ease cut the letters of my name or the date of the year upon a young tree but I could not do so upon an old one the bark would have been too hard and too rugged  Mr Oakley  Why you surprize me But even though your comparison should not be quite exact it is certainly true that if we do not take up a habit of virtue until an advanced age we shall appear the less amiable in the eyes of others because our features long accustomed to express our former vicious inclinations can with difficulty be modelled to represent our present virtuous sentiments and what are we to conclude from this  Arabella  That we shouldthat we should  Mr Oakley  Consider well before you express yourself  Arabella  That we should endeavour while young to have an amiable countenance  Mr Oakley  But if we are not in our heart what our countenance denotes would not the contrast be remarked You said just now of Miss Bloomer that she was not what she wished to be thought So you see  Arabella  Yes I see that we should strive to be really what we wish to appear So for instance if we would appear mild modest reserved or goodnatured we should struggle against all those inclinations that would hinder us to be so in effect otherwise our counterfeit looks will soon be discovered For if one is really mild modest reserved or goodnatured the features of his face will shew it  Mr Oakley  Very well my dear Arabella And is not that an excellent receipt for obtaining true beauty and the genuine art of pleasing How unhappy would those be to whom nature has refused her charms if they were debarred the hopes of acquiring an amiable and engaging countenance by goodness of heart and other qualities most pleasing in the sight of God and man Therefore  my dear take my advice do not go to seek in your glass for the art of appearing better than you really are But whenever you find yourself ruffled by any passion run immediately and consult it You will see the ugliness of envy anger or vanity Then ask yourself if such a portrait can be agreeable in the eyes of either God or man  Arabella  Yes papa your advice is very good and I will follow it But I shall reap another advantage from your instructions  Mr Oakley  What is that  Arabella  I will look very attentively at every body that I see in company and strive to discover by their faces what opinion I should have of them  Mr Oakley  No child take care how you do so The first would be contrary to good manners and unsuitable to the modesty of your sex and the second would be very dangerous considering your candour and inexperience To discover in the features of any person his disposition or way of thinking requires long study repeated observations and a very penetrating judgment You would find yourself continually deceived in your likings or dislikes The knowledge of the world will instruct you by degrees At present study only yourself and use all the strength of your mind to acquire every virtue in order to become more amiable and more beautiful  NARCISSUS AND HIPPOLYTUS  NARCISSUS and Hippolytus were nearly of the same age and loved each other from their earliest infancy As their parents were close neighbours they had opportunities of being together every day Mr Chambers the father of Narcissus had a place under government the profits of which were immense but the father of Hippolytus Mr Marvel possessed a moderate fortune on which however he lived content and all his views aimed at making his son happy by the advantages of a well directed education since he had it not in  his power to leave him great riches To obtain this end he made choice of means the most worthy of his prudence Hippolytus at nine years of age was formed to all the exercises of the body and his understanding enriched with many useful acquirements Being constantly in exercise and motion he was healthy and robust Always contented and happy in the affection of his parents he enjoyed a mild chearfulness which communicated its influence to these who had the happiness of being in his company His little neighbour Narcissus was one who felt this happiness for the moment that Hippolytus left him he would be quite at a loss for amusement That his time might not hang wearisome he was continually eating without being hungry drinking without being dry and dozing without being sleepy So that scarce a day passed but he was troubled with qualms of the stomach or violent headachs Mr Chambers as well as Mr Marvel tenderly wished his son's happiness but to procure it he had unfortunately taken the means which were quite opposite to his end Narcissus from the cradle had been bred up with the utmost delicacy He had always a servant behind him to hand him a chair whenever he had a mind to change his seat He was drest and undrest as if he had not the use of his hands It seemed as if all those who were about him only breathed for him and that he could not help himself even to live While Hippolytus in a thin linen jacket helped his father to cultivate a little garden for his amusement Narcissus in a fine scarlet coat was lolling in a chariot paying morning visits with his mama If ever he went to take the country air and alighted out of the carriage but for a moment they took particular care to put his great coat on and a handkerchief round his head for fear he should catch cold Accustomed as he was to be humoured in his slightest fancies he wished for every thing that he saw but this wish lasted only for a moment and the more troublesome it was to procure him what he wished the sooner he was tired of it To spare him the smallest subject of ill humour his mother had ordered all the servants to respect even his follies This illjudged indulgence made him so whimsical and imperious that every body in the house hated and despised him Besides his parents Hippolytus was the only person that loved him  and could patiently put up with his humours He knew how to manage his temper and could make him even good humoured like himself  How do you contrive to be always so merry said Mr Chambers to him one day I do not well know sir answered he It comes of itself But my papa tells me that one is never perfectly happy without mixing a little work with one's play And I have observed it too whenever any strangers come to our house and we quit our work to entertain them I never find my time hang heavy but on such days It is this mixture of exercise and amusement that makes me always be in good health I fear neither the winds nor the rain neither the heat of the day nor the cold of the evening and I have almost dug up a whole plat in my garden before poor Narcissus quits his bed of a morning Mr Chambers heaved a sigh and that very day he went to consult Mr Marvel how he should act in order to make his son as healthy and as chearful as Hippolytus Mr Marvel took pleasure in answering his questions and laid before him the plan that he had followed The powers of the body and of the mind said he should be equally kept in exercise unless they are meant to be unserviceable as money buried in the ground would be even to its owner Nothing can be imagined more prejudicial to the health and happiness of children than to give them a pusillanimous turn by using them to excessive delicacy and from a pernicious complaisance to give way to their whimsical and obstinate humours To what vexatious disappointments will not a man be exposed who has been accustomed from his childhood to see even his follies flattered since of all the warmest wishes of his heart he may happen to see scarcely one accomplished and thus be led basely to murmur against his destiny when he should for the most part thank heaven for rejecting his infatuated vows He added with tokens of heartfelt satisfaction that Hippolytus would certainly never be that unhappy person Mr Chambers was struck with this discourse and resolved to conduct his son to happiness by the same way Alas it was too late Narcissus now was fourteen years old and his mind so long enervated could not bear any exertion though ever so little fatiguing His mother as weak as himself entreated her husband not to teaze their darling  Her husband wearied out with these entreaties dropped the sensible design that he had formed and the darling sunk more and more into habits of pernicious effeminacy Thus the strength of his body declined in proportion as his mind was degraded by ignorance At sea  th when he had gained the age of seventeen his parents sent him to the university intending him afterwards for the study of the law Hippolytus being destined for the same profession accompanied his young friend I had forgot to mention that Hippolytus in his different studies and acquirements had never had any other instructor than his father Narcissus had as many masters as there are different accomplishments to acquire and he remembered a few of the terms used by each of them tolerably well This was all the fruit of his studies The understanding of Hippolytus on the contrary was like a garden whose airy situation every where admits the kindly rays of the sun and in which every seed by a judicious cultivation comes rapidly to the growth Already well instructed he earnestly desired fresh knowledge His diligence and good behaviour afforded a pattern for imitation to his companions His mild temper his lively apprehension and joyous humour made his company strongly attracting Every body loved him and every body wished to be his friend Narcissus at first was happy to be in the same lodging with him But very soon his pride mortified by the esteem that Hippolytus had acquired would not suffer him to be longer a witness to it He therefore separated from him upon a frivoious pretence Being now left to himself and his own vitiated taste he sighed for pleasure and thoughtlessly snatched at whatever seemed to offer her deceitful image to his view I shall not attempt to describe to you how often he blushed for himself and how from one imprudence to another he fell at last into the grossest irregularities It will suffice to inform you that he returned to his father's house with the seeds of a mortal distemper in his bosom that he languished six months on a bed of pain and expired in the severest agonies Hippolytus came home to his parents regretted both by his teachers and his companions and enriched with a treasure of learning and prudence With what transports of joy was he received by his family O children  how sweet a thing it is to make ourselves beloved by all who know us and at the same time to feel ourselves worthy of this universal affection His mother thought herself the happiest of women and tears of joy filled his father's eyes whenever he beheld him A considerable employment in his profession was conferred on him with the unanimous approbation of all who knew his character and enabled him to gratify his ardent desire of promoting the happiness of his friends And he enjoyed their happiness as much as they did themselves His parents too shared the same generous sentiments and lived in affluence to a good old age He took pleasure in repaying them with interest the attentions which they had shewed for him A wife endowed with beauty and virtue and children resembling himself made his happiness complete Whenever therefore any man was mentioned as being both happy and worthy to be so the name of Hippolytus always occurred first to the thoughts of those who knew him  THE MAN WHO ROSE TO SUDDEN FORTUNE  ONE fine evening in the month of June Mr Russel went out with his son Eugene to take a walk in some of the most agreeable environs of the city The weather was mild the sky clear the purling streams and waving trees lulled them to an agreeable thoughtfulness What a lovely evening said Eugene enchanted with the beauties of nature that surrounded him He pressed his father's hand and said to him If you knew papa what thoughts rise in my heart He was silent for a moment then lifting up towards heaven his eyes which were moistened with tears I thank my God said he for the happy moments that he gives me to enjoy Oh that every body could taste the beauties of the evening as I do That all mankind overflowed with joy as I do at this moment I could wish to be king over a large country that I might make all my subjects happy Mr Russel embraced his son My dear Eugene said he the  benevolent wish that you have just expressed comes from a heart as generous as humane But would not your thoughts change with your fortune Would you preserve in an exalted station these sentiments that animate you now in the middling condition to which heaven has appointed you  Eugene  Why do you ask that question papa cannot one become rich without becoming cruel or wicked  Mr Russel  It does not always happen so my dear There are some fortunate persons who remember their past distresses and in whom this reflection produces sentiments of charity towards the unfortunate But to the disgrace of the human heart a change of fortune frequently alters affections the most tender and sympathetic While we are unfortunate ourselves we think that heaven requires it of all men as a duty to relieve our sufferings If the hand of God remove misfortune from us we conclude all his intents in the preservation of the universe to be fulfilled and we no longer think of those wretches that remain in the gulf from which we have been rescued We have an instance of this in the man who comes sometimes to ask relief of me I give it to him with a reluctance that I cannot conquer though I reproach myself for it  Eugene  Why true papa I observed that you put your alms coldly into his hand without ever giving him those words of comfort that you do to other poor people  Mr Russel  I will shew you my dear whether he deserves them Mr Lowe was a linendraper in the Minories Though the profits of his business were but moderate a poor person never appeared at his door in vain This was all the pleasure that he indulged himself in purchasing and he thought himself happy to enjoy it though he could not command even this to the full extent of his wishes Business called him one day upon Change He saw in one part of it a number of principal merchants together who were talking of vast cargoes and immense profits to be expected from them Ah said he to himself sighing how happy these people are If I were as rich heaven knows I should not be so for myself alone and that the poor should partake of my abundance He goes home full of ambitious thoughts but how can his narrow business enable him to fulfil his  vast projects With tolerable oeconomy it was no more than sufficient to afford him a decent subsistence the year  ound "I shall always be at a stand here" cried he "and never rise above this middling condition in which I linger at present" A handbill inviting adventurers to purchase in the lottery was at this moment put into his hand He seized the idea with eagerness as if inspired by fortune and without minding the inconvenience to which his covetousness might reduce him he went to the lotteryoffice and laid out four guineas the only money that he could spare in the world With what impatience he waited for the drawing He one time repented having so foolishly hazarded a stake the loss of which would disturb him At another time he fancied that he saw riches falling down upon him in showers At last the drawing began  Eugene  Well papa did he get a prize  Mr Russel  Five thousand pounds  Eugene  Aha he would jump for joy  Mr Russel  He went immediately and received his money and spent some days in thinking of nothing else When he had had enough of that I can put this sum to a better use said he than barely poring over it He therefore enlarged his stock extended his dealings and by his activity and knowledge of trade he soon doubled his capital In less than ten years he became one of the richest men in the city It must be said in his praise that he had till then been faithful to his vow in making the poor partake of his abundance At the fight of an unfortunate person he remembered his own former condition without being ashamed of it And this recollection never failed of profiting the person who occasioned it Led by degrees to frequent fine company he contracted a taste for luxury and dissipation He purchased a magnificent countryhouse and fine gardens and his life became a round of pleasures and amusement The most extravagant whims he gratified without scruple but soon perceived that they had made a considerable breach in his fortune Trade which he had given up in order to be quite at leisure to enjoy himself no longer enabled him to repair it Besides a habit of indulgence and a mean vanity would not suffer him to lessen his expences I shall always have enough for one thought he let others provide for themselves  His heart hardened in this resolution was thenceforth shut to the unfortunate He heard the cries of misery around him as one hears the tempest grumble when sheltered from its fury Friends whom he had till then supported came to solicit him for fresh relief But he refused them harshly Have I made a fortune said he only to squander it upon you Do as I do said he depend upon yourselves His mother whom he had cut short of half the pension that he allowed her came to beg for a retired shelter in a corner of his house there to spend her few remaining days but he had the barbarity to refuse her and with dry eyes beheld her die in misery This crime however did not long remain unpunished His debaucheries very soon exhausted all his wealth and deprived him of the strength necessary to support himself by work In short he was reduced to the state of misery in which you see him and now begs his bread from door to door an object of contempt and indignation to all honest people  Eugene  Ah papa since fortune can make men so wicked I wish to remain as I am  Mr Russel  My dear Eugene I wish the same for the sake of your happiness but if heaven destines you to a more exalted station may you never forseit the nobleness and generosity of your soul Think often of the story that I have just now told you Learn from this example that we can never taste true happiness without feeling for the misfortunes of others that it is the powerful man's duty to comfort the sorrows of the weak and that he reaps more true happiness from the performance of this duty than from all his pomp and luxury  The sun was now going to set and his parting beams threw a lively glow upon the clouds which seemed to form a purple curtain round his bed The air freshened at the approach of evening breathed an agreeable calm The birds in repeating their farewel songs rallied all their powers of melody The leaves of the grove mingled a gentle murmur with their concert and every thing seemed to inspire sentiments of joy and happiness but Eugene and his father instead of the transports which they had felt at first returned home lost in melancholy reflexions  THE GREYHOUND AND THE RING  A DRAMA in TWO ACTS  CHARACTERS  Mr CALVERT  SERINA  his Daughter  EUSTACE  his Son  LIONEL  Friends to Eustace  RUFUS  Friends to Eustace  SCENE  An apartment in Mr Calvert's house  ACT I  SCENE I  Serina alone  AH my poor little Diana I shall never be able to sit at work without you It was here on this little cushion that you lay down beside me while I was at my needle How joyful and pleased were we both when you awoke You would run shaking your tail under the sopha and under the chairs and tables and then jump from one to the other How happy did you appear when I took you in my lap How you would li  k my hands and face and play with me Oh how sorry shall I be if I never see you again Ah I should never have lost you myself but that careless  SCENE II  Serina Eustace  Eustace  overhearing these last words  I see my name is called in question  Serina  Ay whose else should it be If you had not been so positive in taking her out with you yesterday she would not have been lost  Eustace  That is true and I am as sorry for it as you are but what can I do now  Serina  Did I not beg of you to leave her at home but you could not go a step without having her at your heels  Eustace  I own it I was so pleased when she was along with me to see her walk sometimes before me and sometimes behind me Then she would run from me as if I was pursuing her and come back again at full speed and jump up about me so playful  Serina  Then you should have taken better care of her  Eustace  Yes I should so But as she used to go away from me and come back of herself without any occasion for my calling her I thought  Serina  You thoughtyou have never the least mistrust of any thing and by that poor Diana was lost  Eustace  I promise you sister the next time  Serina  Yes another time when we have nothing to lose I could not sleep a quarter of an hour together all last night I thought I heard her whining to me at a distance and that I ran to the side from which her cries seemed to come Then I awoke and found myself alone Ah I dare say she is as dull too for her part  Eustace  Dear sister it makes me doubly unhappy to see you grieve so I would give all that I am worth in the world to have her again  Serina  Now you make me grieve still more Why don't you know at least where you missed her One might enquire amongst all the neighbours thereabouts  Eustace  I'd lay a wager she followed me into this street and almost as far as our own house too But as she runs up into every court smelling about somebody must have shut their door upon her and kept her in  Serina  Yes I dare say it was so otherwise she would have come back to her lodging She knows the way to it well enough  Eustace  Lionel was along with me and declared to me that he saw her but the moment before we missed her And it was his fault for he was playing such comical tricks as we walked along that I forgot Diana just then  Serina  Well he should have helped you at least to look for her  Eustace  So he did all yesterday evening and today again very early We went into all the streets and lanes round about and searched every court and market near us We enquired in short among all our acquaintances but could hear nothing of her Indeed sister I am ashamed to look you in the face I know you must be angry with me  Serina  taking him by the hand  No I am not angry now You did not mean to disoblige me and besides you are so sorry yourself But who is this coming up stairs Go and see  SCENE III  Serina Eustace Lionel  Lionel  opening the door  It is I it is I Eustace Good morning to you Miss Serina  Serina  Good morning Master Lionel  Lionel  I have got a scent of Diana and I hope pretty soon  Serina  What to find her again  Lionel  I'll tell you You know that old woman that lives at the corner of the street and sells cakes and garden stuff  Serina  What has she my little dog  Lionel  No no she is a very honest woman and a good friend of mine You know Eustace that Diana too wanted t'other day to scrape acquaintance with her standing up with her paws upon the counter and smelling at the biscuits  Eustace  Ah yes but her little fond tricks would not do there for the old woman gave her a great stroke on the nose with her glove  Serina  Oh that is nothing Well Master Lionel  Lionel  Well just now I went to her shop to buy some cakes and was telling her of our loss What says she that little cur dog  Serina  Cur dog Master Lionel Don't call my pretty Diana so I would rather not hear you talk of her at all  Lionel  Nay I only tell you her own words That little cur dog says she that belongs to that pretty young gentleman your acquaintance Yes said I the same Well you know another little master that lives here below  at the large house with the balcony It was he that coaxed her away  Eustace  How could she mean Rufus  Lionel  Don't you remember that he was at the old woman's shop yesterday as we passed and pretended not to see us for fear of being obliged to offer us some of his walnuts  Eustace  That is very true I recollect it now  Lionel  Well when we had past her house a little way he called Diana as she was following us and offered her a bit of cake and while the poor thing was busy feasting herself he snatched her up in his arms and carried her home The good woman told me the whole trick  Serina  An illnatured creature well however we know where she is Brother you had better go to him without any more ado  Lionel  I am greatly afraid that he would not find her there Rufus has taken her only to sell her as he does his books and whatever else he can purloin at his father's He is capable of any thing Why we were playing at marbles t'other day and he cheated  Eustace  Ay  is that his way I'll run to him this moment  Lionel  You will not find him at home I have just been there and he was out  Serina  Perhaps he bid them say that he was not at home  Lionel  No I went up to his room and I told the maid that I wanted him to come and play at marbles and that I would wait for him at your house  Serina  He will never have the face to shew himself here if he has really taken Diana  Lionel  Ah you do not know his assurance He would come here on purpose that you might not suspect him but I'll convict him before you  Serina  We must go cunningly to work and question him slily to make him discover the secret  Lionel  I'll tell you All the cunning required is to shew him at the first word that he is a rogue and a thief  Eustace  No no my dear Lionel that would only b  ing on a quarrel and my papa would not have any here Mild words perhaps will touch him better than reproaches or violence  Serina  Perhaps too he does not know that the little greyhound is ours  Lionel  Not know does not he see her along with your brother every day he has played with her a hundred times and stole her yesterday to sell her That is just his character  Eustace  Hist here he comes  SCENE IV  Serina Eustace Lionel Rufus  Rufus  They told me at home Lionel that you wanted me to play at marbles Come I am ready Ah Eustace how do you do Your humble servant miss  Serina  You are going to your diversion Master Rufus Nothing gives you uneasiness but we are all in trouble here  Rufus  What is the matter then  Serina  We have lost our pretty little greyhound  Rufus  Dear that is a pity she  was  a pretty little creature indeed Her body so handsome a gre  with black spots here and there and her breast and forefeet and tail all white She is worth two guineas if she is worth a farthing  Serina  You know her so well could not you help us to f  d her again  Rufus  Do you take me for a dogkeeper or am I obliged to look after yours  Eustace  My sister did not mean to affront you Rufus  Serina  Oh dear no It was only a civil question As you live in our neighbourhood and she was lost not far off I thought that you might have been able to give us some account of her  Lionel  Certainly you could not apply to a better person  Rufus  What do you mean by that Master Lionel  Lionel  What is best known to yourself though I am perfectly acquainted too with the whole affair  Rufus  If it were not out of respect to miss  Lionel  You should thank her yourself that I do not chastise you for your impudence  Eustace  taking Lionel aside  Softly my dear Lionel or we shall lose the greyhound  Serina  If as you say you have some regard for me Master Rufus be so good as to hear me attentively and answer me yes or no  Lionel  And without shuffling  Serina  Have not you our greyhound or don't you know where she is  Rufus  confused  I I your greyhound  Lionel  Do you stammer at the question you have her And I know the whole story too You took her treacherously coaxing her with a bit of cake  Rufus  Who told you so  Lionel  One that saw you do it  Serina  I ask it as a favour of you Master Rufus to tell me is that true or false  Rufus  And suppose I did give your dog a bit of cake or that I took her up a moment to play with her is that a reason that I should have her or know what is become of her  Serina  Nor do we say so We only ask you if you know where she is just now  Eustace  Or if you did not keep her at your house last night out of a frolick to frighten us a little and afterwards to give us the pleasure of a surprize  Rufus  What do you take our house for a dogkennel  Lionel  He must have a vast deal of assurance  Rufus  I have nothing to say to  you  You may be counsellor f  r greyhounds as long as you will I won't be examined by you  Lionel  Because I have confounded you  Serina  Softly Master Lionel you must be mistaken I cannot suspect Master Rufus of so much meanness as to keep our dog if he had found it  Eustace  If he had lost any thing and I could give him an account of it I would do it with pleasure So he need not be angry at our questions  Rufus  I am very angry at them and I will make a complaint of it to your father  Lionel  You had better come to the cakewoman's house I will go along with you  Rufus  It is very pretty of you to believe such a prating gossip before me  Lionel  Such gossips however have eyes and ears and as far as honesty is concerned I should trust them sooner than you  Rufus  I won't put up with this affront and you shall pay for it  He goes out  SCENE V  Serina Eustace Lionel  Lionel  What an impudent liar I would lay my life that he has the dog Did not you see how he was confounded when I told him flatly that he had her  Serina  I cannot believe it yet and indeed it would be quite too scandalous  Lionel  You cannot believe it miss because your own heart is so good for my part I can believe any thing of him  Serina  I must own however that it was very rude not to answer our questions civilly  Lionel  If you had not been here miss I would have tweaked him by the ears a little  Eustace  Tut man he is taller than you by the head  Lionel  If he was twice as tall I'll wager he is a coward Did not you observe that he grew more impudent as we were more civil and the harder I pushed him the quieter he became But I'll go and follow him and take Diana from him wherever he has put her  Serina  Your pains would be to no purpose master Lionel Once more I cannot believe it He lives too near us to expect to hide such a theft from us  Eustace  I hope he may not go and kill her for fear of being found out in a lie  Lionel  No my friend he won't kill her He keeps her for sale  Serina  O heavens what an opinion you have of him  Lionel  It is such as he deserves and I'll go and convince you of it  SCENE VI  Serina Eustace  Eustace  Lionel is too hot He makes a terrible quarrel of the smallest difference If they must wrangle I am glad at least that it is not here  Serina  For then papa would give us a fine lesson Lionel I believe is willing to serve us but I am sorry that he seems to seek his own revenge more than our advantage  Eustace  He desires no better than to be in every quarrel and he has done us more harm than good If Rufus really stole Diana he would return her to me sooner for good words than for threats But here comes papa  SCENE VII  Mr Calvert Serina Eustace  Mr Calv  What have you done to Rufus He came to me as I was in my room and seemed quite ruffled He complains of you very much but particularly of Lionel and says that you accuse him of stealing Diana Is she lost  Eustace  Ah yes papa I did not like to tell you because I hoped every moment to find her again She went astray from me yesterday evening  Serina  Ah you cannot imagine how sorry I am for her I cried the best part of last night when I awoke and missed her from my side  Mr Calv  Luckily it is but a dog Losses of much more consequence happen every day in the world and we should early accustom ourselves to bear with them But you  to Eustace  why did not you take care of her  Eustace  You are very right papa It was my fault I should have left her at home or else not have lost sight of her since I took her in my charge And I am sorry for it especially on account of my sister because Diana was hers more than mine  Serina  I cannot be angry with my brother for it I have sometimes vexed him without intention and he has excused me  Mr Calv  Kiss me my dear child I love to see you bear a misfortune with courage but I am still better pleased to see you in the midst of your grief not the least provoked against him that occasioned it  Serina  My poor brother is sufficiently punished for his negligence for he was as fond of Diana as I She was all his amusement and he grieves besides that he was the occasion of my uneasiness  Mr Calv  Always preserve these sentiments my dear children one towards the other and indeed towards all your fellowcreatures for they are of the same family I know many persons who for such a trifle would have turned away an honest servant  Serina  Oh heaven forbid Prefer a dog to a servant A creature without reason to a person of our own kind  Mr Calv  Why do not all men make that difference as well as you my dear child We should not then know those who would rather see a poor child suffer hunger or thirst than a favourite dog who shed tears at the indisposition of a spaniel and look without pity on the lot of an unhappy orphan abandoned by all the world  Serina  papa is it possible  Mr Calv  In return for the sentiment which draws that generous sigh from your breast I promise you my dear a greyhound as handsome as the one that you have lost if you are not lucky enough to find her again  Serina  No papa I thank you I have suffered too much from the loss of Diana If she does not come back I will never have another I will not run the risque of grieving so again  Mr Calv  You carry things too far my dear Serina In that case we must resign all the most agreeable pleasures of life We should be afraid to love a friend because death or absence might one day separate us from him If you compare the pleasure which Diana's playful fondness has afforded you ever since she was born to the short uneasiness that her loss occasions to you now the first you will find exceeds the second by a great deal Nothing is more natural than to be fond of a pretty little creature like Diana and indeed it would be a mark of ingratitude in you  Serina  Yes if I did not think of her now because she is not here to play about me  Mr Calv  What comforts me a little in this misfortune is that from this you will be better enabled to bear perhaps a greater Every thing that we possess upon earth may slip from our hands with the same readiness and it is wise to accustom ourselves early to the most severe losses But with regard to our first subject of conversation you have treated Rufus ill it seems  Serina  Not we papa we spoke to him very mildly It was Lionel that touched him close a little  Mr Calv  And what did he say in answer  Eustace  He defended himself but lamely Indeed he was quite out of countenance at the first question  Serina  But now I will ask you papa do you think that he could have the assurance to deny it if he had really taken my greyhound  Mr Calv  I can say nothing as to that but I should think his confusion could not come from a very clear conscience However that we may have no reproach to make to ourselves concerning Diana we must advertise her tomorrow in the public papers  Eustace  But papa if she is really in his power that trouble will be useless  Mr Calv  No it cannot be useless A dog requires to be fed and is not so small or so quiet that one can hide it from every body's eyes There may happen to be some person in his house honest enough to give us information of it I will not apply to his father I know his rude manners too well Besides he is offended with me for forbidding you a too close intimacy with his son We must wait to see what our advertisement will produce  Serina  I should have some hopes from it if I were able to promise a large reward to whoever would bring me back the dog  Mr Calv  I shall take care of that Come Eustace into my closet we will put down her description and you shall take it to the printingoffice  Serina  Oh what joy it would be for the poor little creature and for me too to see each other once more  ACT II  SCENE I  Eustace Serina  Eustace  running into the room overjoyed  Sister Sister  Serina  What is the matter You seem to be in high spirits Is Diana found  Eustace  Diana Oh something much better See  shewing a ring in a small case  look at what I have found not a yard from our door  Serina  Oh the charming ring But the stone that should be in the middle where is that  Eustace  I suppose it had fallen out See here it is in a paper Look at this diamond in the light See how it sparkles My papa's brilliant is not so large  Serina  I pity him very much that has lost it  Eustace  It is worse than to lose a greyhound  Serina  Oh I don't know that My little Diana was so pretty and so fond of us And then we had her a whelp Oh when I think how happy we were to see her learn new tricks as she grew bigger and to amuse ourselves with her play the finest ring that ever I could put on my finger would not make me half so happy  Eustace  But with this ring you might buy a hundred grey hounds like her  Serina  It should not buy mine for all that He that lost the ring has others perhaps and I had only my poor Diana I am worse off than he is  Eustace  It must belong to a rich man Poor people have not such toys as this  Serina  Yet if it was some unfortunate servant that lost it in taking it to the jewelleror if it was the jeweller himself the diamond being loose would make one suspect so what a misfortune it would be for the poor people  Eustace  You are right Well now I am quite out of humour with my prize We must ask papa's advice about it Oh this is lucky here he comes  SCENE II  Mr Calvert Eustace Serina  Mr Calv  Well will the advertisement for your greybound be in tomorrow's paper  Eustace  Papa I have not been at the office yet Here is what kept me A ring that I have found  Gives him the case  Mr Calv  A very fine diamond indeed  Eustace  An't it This is enough to put a little dog out of one's head for a moment or two  Mr Calv  Yes if it were your own Do you intend to keep it  Eustace  Why if nobody makes inquiry about it  Mr Calv  Did any body see you take it up  Eustace  No papa  Serina  For my part I should never rest until I knew who owned it  Eustace  Let the owner shew himself and certainly the ring shall not stay long in my hands No that would be as bad as if I had stolen it We must give every one his own  Mr Calv  You will not be perhaps so well pleased then  Eustace  Why not papa I own I did not think of any thing at first but my good luck in finding such a jewel I looked upon it as already my property but my sister has given me an idea of the trouble that he must feel who lost it I should be much happier in putting an end to his uneasiness than in keeping this ring which would make me blush every time that I looked at it  Serina  There is so much pleasure in comforting those who are troubled For that reason I cannot imagine that Rufus or any other could be so illnatured as to keep my Diana if he knew how sorry I am for her  Mr Calv  kissing them  Amiable little innocents My dear children how I rejoice in being your father Let such generous sentiments continue to spring up and gain strength in your hearts They will be the foundation of your own happiness and that of your fellowcreatures  Serina  You give us the example papa How should we have other sentiments  Eustace  Oh I'll go and shew my prize to every body and we should advertise both together in the papers that we have lost a greyhound and found a ring  Mr Calv  Not so fast my dear there are precautions to be taken There might be some people who would claim the ring without being the owners  Serina  Oh I should be as cunning as they I would ask them first how it was made and I would not give it to any but him that told me very particularly  Mr Calv  That way is not the surest neither A person may have seen it upon the owner's finger and come here before him to demand it  Serina  Ah papa I see you know better how to manage than we do  Mr Calv  The loser will think it worth while to make every enquiry after so valuable an article So we must wait  Eustace  But if they should not think of doing so  Serina  We thought of doing so for Diana certainly others will for a diamond  Mr Calv  Meanwhile I shall take care of it and do you be cautious not to speak of it to any body  SCENE III  Eustace Serina  Eustace  It is very stupid for all that not to be able to talk when one has any thing so agreeable to tell I should have been so happy to shew every body my ring  Serina  And why since you neither can nor would keep it There is no great merit in finding any thing valuable in the street  Eustace  That is true but what I tell you is very true too  Serina  People say of the ladies that they cannot keep a secret Let us see which of us two will be most discreet  Eustace  For fear my secret should want to escape I will think of nothing but Diana and now I'll go to the printingoffice with the advertisement  Serina  Go brother do not lose a moment But what does Lionel want with us  SCENE IV  Serina Eustace Lionel  Lionel  to Eustace who is going out  Where are you going Eustace  Eustace  I have something particular to do  Lionel  Oh before you go you must liften to a story that I have to tell you It will make you die with laughing Ha ha ha ha  Eustace  I have not time for laughing now  Lionel  You will laugh in spite of yourself Only listen We have got full satisfaction  Eustace  Full satisfaction Of whom  Lionel  Of Rufus He has lost his father's ring Ha ha ha ha  Eustace and Serina look at each other with an air of surprize  Serina  His father's ring  Lionel  It is fact He had it given to him this morning to take to the jeweller's to have the middle diamond set in again that had fallen out  Eustace jogs Serina she makes a sign to him to be silent  He had it when he came here but as he went away quite flustered with anger the case of the ring must have dropt out of his pocket as he whisked along  Serina  And have you seen him since he lost it How does he look  Lionel  Frightened out of his wits  Serina  Does his father know it  Lionel  There he has drawn himself into a fresh scrape by telling a great fib When his father asked him if he had given the ring to the jeweller he answered with the greatest assurance that he had  Scrina  Unhappy creature  Lionel  Why you pity him do you  Eustace  Indeed he is to be pitied  Lionel  He I wish you had seen what game I made of him  Serina  What did you find so comical in all that  Lionel  How don't you take the jest To see him running from shop to shop inquiring about his ring and plucking every one by the skirt that passed I stuck close to him to enjoy his distress and at last he came up to  me "Have not you found it Have you heard nothing of it" What is it to me said I to him Am I your ringkeeper"If you knew what it was worth" So much the better for him that has found it "And then my father what will he say" Why he'll talk to you with a good stick  Serina  Fie master Lionel that was very cruel of you  Lionel  He had not more feeling for you  Eustace  Should we be illnatured then even towards those that are so themselves  Lionel  Oh revenge is sweet and I never have any compassion for them that offend me If I had the good luck to find his ring he should not have it so soon  Serina  Would you keep it then  Lionel  Oh no I would give it to him after his father had threshed him well  Eustace  I should never have thought you so illnatured Lionel  Serina  And I cannot believe it though I hear it from his own mouth You were so much concerned about my poor greyhound It seems it was not in earnest  Lionel  It was from the bottom of my heart I love those dearly that I do love but when I hate any one I hate him heartily  SCENE V  Serina Eustace Lionel Rufus  Lionel  Heh there he comes  Points at him with his finger  Ha ha ha ha  Rufus  Oh pray now forgive me I have been very bad to be sure but I have been full as unfortunate I am punished now and well punished too for  Lionel  Have you stuck up handbills concerning your ring  Rufus  I dare not appear before my father and I don't know where to hide myself  Lionel  I would lay a wager that the ring is hanging at Diana's tail We shall find them both together  Rufus  I have deserved your jeers but for pity's sake  Eustace  Make yourself easy master Rufus your ring is here  Rufus  astonished  What have you it You my ring  Lionel  aside to Serina  He is making game of him that is right  Rufus  But is it really so Oh on my knees I'll But noyou shall first hear how wicked I have been  SCENE VI  Serina Eustace Lionel  Serina  What is the meaning of that He is gone off  Eustace  I am afraid the poor boy has lost his wits  Lionel  Your joke for all that may cost you dear If he goes and fetches his father to demand the ring  Eustace  Do you think then that I will keep it  Lionel  Why have you actually the ring  Eustace  Certainly I have it otherwise I should not have said so I picked it up close by our door  Lionel  Indeed you are too good He does not deserve to be so happy You should have left him a little longer in pain at least  Serina  How master Lionel Does not my brother's example move you Do you know that you lose ground now very much in his friendship and mine  SCENE VII  Mr Calvert Serina Eustace Liovel  Mr Calv  What is the matter with Rufus I saw him from my window come in here all in tears  Serina  The poor boy was half dead  Eustace  It was he who lost the ring that I found It belongs to his father  Mr Calv  Have you convinced him of the meanness of his behaviour towards us  Lionel  Dear sir no Diana has not been so much as mentioned  Mr Calv  At least I would have insisted upon his returning her He should not hear of his ring without that  Eustace  Ah papa my heart would not let me be so harsh I saw Rufus so afflicted  Serina  Though I love Diana very well I could not possibly think of her just then nor of any thing but the grief of that unfortunate boy  Mr Calv  You have both acted generously and you are my dear children my best friends all my joy and all my pride None but base souls would insult the distress of an enemy that is fallen But where is Rufus Why did not he ask for the ring as he went away  Eustace  He was so transported with joy that he did not know what he was doing  Serina  He ran towards the door and went out as if he were mad  Eustace  O papa did you but know how overjoyed I am to see you approve my behaviour and my sister's  Mr Calv  Could you believe me insensible to a generous action  Eustace  Because you had forbidden me  Mr Calv  I forbad you to speak unguardedly about the ring but I did not tell you to keep it when the owner should appear  SCENE VIII  Mr Calvert Serina Eustace Lionel Rufus having the greyhound under his arm  Serina  with an exclamation of joy  Ah Diana my dear Diana  She runs to her takes her up in her arms and caresses her  Rufus  You see how much I was to blame and how little I deserved your generosity Can you pardon me this fraud and my unworthy behaviour  Perceiving Mr Calvert  Ah sir how bad I must appear in your eyes  Mr Calv  A person is no longer so when he acknowledges his fault and endeavours as you do to repair it Here is your father's ring  Rufus  I am ashamed and sorry to have offended so excellent children What difference between them and me How wicked I am and how generous are they  Serina  It is only a little prank of yours Master Rufus and you would not have let the day pass without returning Diana to me  Rufus  You think too well of me I had hid her up in the garret and  Mr Calv  We don't wish to know any more It is sufficient that you are sorry for what you have done You  now see yourself that bad actions make God and man our enemies and are always discovered sooner or later I should take the liberty too of proposing to you as a model the behaviour of my children generous little creatures How should I thank Heaven for sending me such a gif  You see the most noble and certain revenge is that of doing kindnesses and that nothing is more worthy a great spirit than to repay illnature with good offices  Rufus  Ah I feel that now myself with the most lively sorrow  To Eustace and Serina  Will you ever forgive me  Eustace  taking his hand  Yes from this moment and sincerely  Serina  I have my Diana once more and all is forgot  Rufus  to Lionel  We should be unworthy of this pattern if we did not follow it  Lionel  I am as much ashamed as you and this lesson shall not be lost on me  Rufus  I have just confessed all to my father In proportion as he was angry with me he was touched with your generosity He requests permission to come in about an hour hence to thank you and to beg your acceptance of a small token of his gratitude  Mr Calv  No there is no occasion for any presents To do well my children desire no reward but from themselves Besides restoring a person his property is no more than a strict duty  Eustace  How pleasing to perform that duty I have gained a friend for my whole life have not I Rufus  Rufus  If I could be worthy of that honour I shall do every thing in my power to be so  Lionel  Do not exclude me from your friendship I was no better than Rufus but I have just now felt how noble a passion revenge may be made  Serina  caressing the greyhound  Ah little runaway this will teach you another time to stray from your masters you have passed a night in prison for it Offer to do so again and you'll seeWell what would be the consequence Ah no whatever you do I find I shall always be fond of you  THE HEN  HOW happy was Cyprian in so worthy and affectionate a father as Mr Tisdall Whenever he had shown himself for any length of time discreet and diligent he was assured that his father would not fail to testify his satisfaction with some recompence or other Cyprian had a taste for gardening and began about the age of twelve to cultivate choice flowers His father saw it and immediately began to study how he might afford his son more pleasure  They were both at dinner Cyprian said his father your preceptor has informed me that you have begun this very day to read the Roman History and the Geography of Italy If in a week you can but give me an exact account of every thing you may have learned on these two subjects you cannot think what I intend shall recompence your application  Cyprian one may easily suppose did not forget such a promise He employed himself in studying all the week to get this recompence or rather he received such pleasure from his study that indeed it was he who should have bestowed a recompence on his Papa if he had been able  He saw the day of trial come without anxiety and underwent the examination like an hero He had learned the history of all the kings of Rome and marked out in his map the gradual progress of that growing empire  In a transport of delight his father took him by the hand embraced and kissed him Come says he since you have sought to give me so much pleasure it is but just that I should contribute in my turn to yours Saying this he led him into an adjoining garden pointed out a vacant spot to him and told him that it was to be his You may part it in two continued he and plant what flowers you like in one and any vegetables that you think proper in the other After this they went into an outhouse close behind the gardener's hut where Cyprian found a spade a wateringpot a rake and other implements of gardening all perfectly adapted to his size and strength On the walls were baskets hung up of every size great and small  and on shelves about them sundry boxes full of roots and bags of seeds the whole together duly ticketed with cards on every box and bag marking the proper time for sowing each article  One should be of Cyprian's age to know the excess of his joy upon this occasion In his mind the little spot of earth which his father had assigned him was as great as monarchs think their kingdoms and whatever hours of relaxation his preceptor let him take and which he spent before in folly were now taken up in cultivating his domain  One day when he came in from doing something about his garden he forgot to shut the gate A hen was pecking near the spot and took it in her head to go a hunting on his grounds The flowerbed had been strewed but lately with a layer of the richest mould and was consequently quite full of worms  The hen charmed with such delicious fare began to scratch the mould up and employ her beak as well as talons to unearth the worms and in particular she took a mighty inclination to a part where Cyprian had the day before been planting some fine pinks  How great therefore was the excess of his rage when coming back to his plantation he beheld the door a jar and this newfashioned gardener digging up his beds Ah ah you impudent slut said he your bones shall pay for this And immediately he shut the door for fear his victim should escape and picking up flint stones sand clods of earth and whatever he could lay hold of he threw them at the bird pursuing her all the while as close as he could  The frightened hen at one time ran with all her speed and at another time strove to fly upon the wall but found that her wings would not befriend her in reaching such a height Unhappily she fell back more than once on Cyprian's flowers and got her wings and feet entangled with the finest hyacinths  Young Cyprian beholding her thus embroiled supposed that he had her fast Two rows of tulips separated them His anger was so vehement that stepping over as he meant to do this interval of separation between the hen and him he trod them down himself The hen however at her enemy's approach redoubled her former  efforts and attempted now a second time to gain the wall She rose a great deal higher than before yet still came short but what was matter of regret for Cyprian bore away with her from underneath as she rose a beautiful rosebudcoloured tenbelled hyacinth On this he seized his rake and flung it at the bird with all his strength The rake turned round and while he fancied it upon the point of hitting the fugitive mark it came down and dashed two panes of glass to pieces in a melon frame as well as broke out two of its own teeth upon the ground  The little Fury made much more furious by these damages had run for his spade and now the combat would perhaps have had fatal consequences for his feathered adversary who fatigued and giddy had crept in between a rosebush and the wall if Mr Tisdall at first attracted to his window by the noise had not made haste to her assistance  The moment Cyprian saw his father he stood stock still in evident confusion however he made shift to find his tongue at last and cried out See papa what ravage this vile creature has committed in my garden  Had you shut the door replied his father with an affected indifference this ravage would not have been made I saw your whole behaviour Are you not ashamed of having put forth all your strength against a harmless hen She has no  reason  to conduct herself and though she has rooted up your pinks it was not with a wish to do you any damage but to get her ordinary food Now Cyprian should you have put yourself thus into a passion if she had scratched up nothing but as many nettle roots And how can she distinguish between pinks and nettles It is yourself alone that are to blame for all this havock With precaution you would certainly have driven her out so that she might do no further mischief and in that case neither your rake nor my melon frame would have gone to ruin or your loss have exceeded that of a few flowers Therefore you alone are punishable so that were I to cut a branch off from this hazletree and with it make you suffer just what you designed the hen should sufferwhich of us would act with the greatest justice I shall not however go to this extremity purposely to shew you that we may all suppress our resentment if we think proper Notwithstanding for the damage done to my melon frame  I shall deduct as much as will repair it from the arrears of your allowance in my hands for I am not to suffer through your rashness  Cyprian upon this withdrew much abashed and all day durst scarcely lift his eyes up while before his father  On the morrow Mr Tisdall proposed a walk and asked if he desired to join him Cyprian followed but oppressed with sadness which he sought in vain to hide His father saw it and affecting a degree of wonder wished to know why he appeared so grievously dejected  Cyprian  Have I not the greatest cause to be dejected For this whole month past I have denied myself so many pleasures merely to buy something for my sister I had saved ten shillings with which I thought to purchase her a pretty hat but must give the half of it perhaps to have your melon frame repaired  Mr Tisdall  I dare say you would have been delighted to oblige your sister but my melon frame however must be paid for first This lesson will teach you in future not to yield yourself up to the mischiefs of resentment which in general aggravates the first misfortune happening to us  Cyprian  Ah you may depend upon it sir I will never leave the gardendoor open again or take revenge upon a hen for what would be my own omission  Mr Tisdall  But pray tell me do you fancy that in this vast universe hens only have it in their power to do you damage  Cyprian  O no no for look ye not above a week ago I left my map upon the table while I went a walking and my little sister coming into the room with a pen and ink so blotted it all over that no one could distinguish Europe from America  Mr Tisdall  Then it is prudent to secure yourself against the mischiefs that you may suffer from your fellowcreatures  Cyprian  It is so papa  Mr Tisdall  Without desiring in the least to give you a distaste of life I can assure you that you will have to suffer many disagreeable affairs and those a deal more prejudicial to you than the mischiefs caused by the hen Mankind always seek their interest and their pleasures  just as hens seek worms and they will do so at the hazard of your interests as hens will at the hazard of your flowers  Cyprian  I see it plainly sir by Bella's behaviour since the little pleasure that she received from scribbling on a bit of paper has occasioned me the loss of an extremely useful map  Mr Tisdall  But could you not have avoided this loss by putting up your map before you left the apartment  Cyprian  Certainly  Mr Tisdall  Then think for the future to conduct yourself so that no body may have power to do you any real mischief but if after all in spite of your precaution you should be so unlucky as to receive an injury consider how you may endure it so as not to render the first wrong still more prejudicial  Cyprian  Ay papa but how must I endure it  Mr Tisdall  With indifference if it be a slight injury but on the other hand if a great one with courage Now that we are by ourselves I dare propose you as an example the conduct that I pursue towards Mr Hotham  Cyprian  Pray don't speak of him papa These two years past he takes no notice of you whenever you meet each other and there cannot be a falsity that he will not say to prejudice you in the opinion of the world  Mr Tisdall  And do you know what urges him to such behaviour  Cyprian  That I never yet durst ask you  Mr Tisdall  Nothing but for the preference which I obtained respecting an employ that my father had so worthily filled up for five and thirty years and to which he had affectionately formed me by the most diligent instruction Mr Hotham had no title to the post except his ignorance and selfsufficiency My right succeeded notwithstanding all his interest and therefore am I honoured with his calumny and hatred  Cyprian  Ah papa were I as big as you I'd teach him better manners  Mr Tisdall  Quite the contrary I let him go on railing at me just as he thinks fit The conduct which you should have pursued when you were injured by the hen I faithfully pursue towards him The pinks that she scratched up by the roots in seeking for worms may  represent the reputable character that I bear and which in order to gratify the worm of Envy that gnaws him he labours to undo Were I to seek the means of punishing him I should trample under foot that deference and respect which I owe to myself as you trod under foot your tulips The me  on frame and rake which you damaged are that wealth and peace of mind that I should destroy by hurrying on to vengeance Taught in future by the losses that you have suffered you will shut the garden door in order to keep the hen out Taught too by the wicked disposition of my enemy I lay by means of proper conduct on my part an insuperable barrier between us Thus inaccessible to his vindictive attempts I enjoy the comforts of my moderation while he spends himself in those attempts and will in time experience the compunction of his evil conscience Could his insults vex me I should make myself the victim that he would sacrifice and be reproached for imbecility by every worthy character of my acquaintance while on the other hand the insensibility that I manifest for his injurious treatment yields him to his own contempt and in the bosom of good men keeps up the reputation that I have gained among them  Cyprian  Ah papa what trouble may I not shun hereafter by remembering every thing that you have taught me  These last words were hardly uttered when they found themselves at home without imagining that they had been so near it Their discourse for the remainder of the day was a continuation of the past and bedtime being come they separated quite content with one another Cyprian sunk to slumber with a bosom full of gratitude for the instruct on which he had just received and Mr Tisdall with one possessing all the satisfaction that a good father cannot but experience who is sensible that he has done something to promote his offspring's happiness  THE LITTLE NEEDLEWOMEN  CHARACTERS  Mrs VINCENT  her Daughters

so hard at work  Clara  But you know your mama and mine both sent her money  Louisa  So they did but there were debts to pay and bread to buy As for clothes  Leoncra  We have taken that upon us  Clara  But my dear why not much rather send them some of your own old clothes You would in that case spare yourselves a deal of trouble  Louisa  How you talk As if our clothes were fit for such small children  Clara  That I know they would have been too big and dragged upon the ground at least a quarter of a yard but then their mother might have made them less herself  Louisa  She cannot  Clara  And why not  Leonora  looking stedfastly upon Clara  Because her parents never taught her how to use her needle  Louisa  Now as we are rather ready at it we desired mama to let us have some dimity and other stuff and to out us out the necessary patterns promising to do the rest ourselves  Leonora  And when the whole is finished we shall visit the poor woman with it that her children may be dressed

good deal  Leonora  with a sneer  She tried but  Louisa  Indeed we had almost finished when she came  Sophy  She made a stitch or two but she hardly knows more than I if you had but seen mama how

Sophy  Shall I go and fetch them up  Mrs Vincent  Yes follow me and you shall come back with them In the interim I will have a little conversation with the mother and contrive how she may find out some employment for the time to come and earn a little money  She goes out with Sophy  L  e  Stay you here with us Clara we shall want your help and you must have some business at our toilet  Clara  embracing Louisa  Ah my friend you have a good heart I see that plainly  Lionora  I have had a fling or two at you Clara Lo  a makes me blush and therefore I entreat your pardon  Clara  embracing

indeed for my part I was puzzled likewise Madge's feet were covered and I could not see her head We need but change There is Joan's  Louisa  Let us be as quick as possible and in the mean time Sophy do you run and bid mama come up  Sophy  I am gone  She goes out  Louisa  Ah now all is right Turn roundOnce more Very well and now take one another by the hand and walk across the room before us  The children do so and survey themselves with pleasure  Clara  How extremely well they fit they are quite pretty and there is only one thing wanted  To Madge  Here is my handkerchiefBlow hard  To Joan  Now youWhat elseIf you had time to dress their hair  Louisa  No no my dear Clara it is much better hanging loosely Leonora what say you  Leonora  A comb however to untangle it would not be much amiss I will do that Louisa  Sophy  runs in jumping  Here is mama  Mrs Vinrent enters with the mother of the children  The Mother  Oh heavens what do I see Are these my children O my generous lady  falling down at Mrs Vincent's feet  Mrs Vincent  lifting her up  My good friend it is not to me that you are indebted for this happiness My children wished to make a trial of their skill in needlework and I permitted them to do so  Examining the children's jackets  Not so bad considering a first essay you might almost set up for yourselves  The Mother  to Louisa and her sister  My charming ladies let me thank you God will recompense your kindness for I cannot  Perceiving Clara at a distance  Pardon me my little lady I did not see you otherwise I should have paid you also my acknowledgments  Clara  sighing  No no I had no hand in this day's business  Mrs Vincent  Do not afflict yourself upon that account my dear By sighing you will get nothing but by stedfastly resolving every thing However tell me do not you think it useful and delightful for a young lady like you to accustom herself betimes to work of some sort or other  Clara  Think so Certainly  Mrs Vincent  Of what real pleasure even at present are you not deprived by having hitherto neglected an employment so adapted to your sex and age  The Mother  Dear little lady learn betimes if you would be considered provident or prudent to love work or it will soon be too late I should be very happy now had any one but given me such a lesson in my childhood I could now have got my br  ad and been of use to those dependant on me for support instead of being burthensome to worthy people  Mrs Vincent  Truly my good friend it would have been much happier for you I must own although I should have lost the pleasure of assisting you But you are yet full young enough to make up for lost time by application to some honest labour Children you must know I have procured her some employment at a weaver's in the neighbourhood and when she happens to have  nothing to do there she is to come and work here in the garden  Sophy  I am very glad of that for I will go too and help her if I am able  Mrs Vincent  With respect to Madge and Joan I mean that my house shall be their school and you have both  to Louisa and Leonora  deserved to be their mistresses in work and reading  Clara  And may I be their assistant madam  Mrs Vincent  With all my heart if your mama consents in which case you and Sophy shall endeavour to outdo each other  To the poor woman  My good friend are you contented that matters should be as I have settled  The Mother  Contented My benevolent and generous lady I shall owe you all my happiness and that too of my destitute and friendless children Dear good angels give God thanks for having blessed you with so careful a mamma who trains you up thus betimes to diligence You see it is the source of comfort to yourselves and to us too  âˆµ  Omitted here  "THE LOVE OF GOD AND OF OUR PARENTS"  a Piece that

DOUG  AS  their Children  UOENIA  their Children  MARY ANNE  their Children  The  SCENE  is at the entrance of a grove before the house of Captain Greville somewhat distant from the road  SCENE I  D  uglas and Eugenia  Eugenia is discovered sitting on a trunk and picking strawberries Beside her lies her straw bat to hold the strawberries when picked Douglas brings her more in his Both bats are neatly lined with leaves  Douglas  LOOK ye sister we shall quickly have enough  Eugenia  I do not know Douglas how I shall dispose of mine my hat is too full already  Douglas  Mary Anne cannot be long before she brings the bushel and indeed she might have gone into the house found one and returned in much less time than this However in the interval Eugenia put them in your apron  Eugenia  Yes yes that would make fine work indeed To spot it all from top to bottom What do you suppose mama would say and therefore I have thought of something else Your hat is biggest so I will add my strawberries to yours and you shall go and gather more while I am picking these  Douglas  Well said indeed and in the interim Mary Anne cannot fail to come and then we shall have got enough  Eugenia  When they are all together we shall see  Douglas  What is over when the baskets are filled we will take ourselves  Eugenia  I think we shall not have much appetite to taste them afterwards Ah brother it is the last time that we shall eat with our papa this year and who can tell whether we shall ever see him more  Douglas  Oh do not be dejected sister Every one is not killed in a battle  Eugenia  Oh frightful war if men were not so wicked but would love each other just as we do  Douglas  Mighty fine indeed And do not we quarrel every day for trifles We each think ourselves in the right and frequently it would puzzle any one to find which is It is just the same among grown men  Eugenia  They ought at least then to be friends again as soon as we are Our worst quarrels never come to bloodshed  Douglas  No because our parents settle them but men Eugenia are not children and won't let themselves be governed if they have but arms And in fact is it right that we should suffer any one to injure us without resisting  Eugenia  You are always talking like a soldier  Douglas  A good reason why because I am to be one Look ye sister notwithstanding any thing that you say against it war is a very charming thing Without it how do you imagine that we should live would our papa's little fortune be sufficient to support us But do not weep You grieve me  Eugenia  Let me weep dear brother while we are alone I had much rather do so here than in the presence of papa for I know it would afflict him  Douglas  Come come dry your eyes and set to work for some amusement I will go and fill your hat  Eugenia  Go that way we have left none hereabouts  Douglas goes out and after a moment's silence she goes on  I would I were but learned enough that I might pray to God for he would hear me Or at least if I were big enough I would go to court and fall before the king and he I am sure would grant me my papa's dismission when I begged and prayed him to oblige me He has served his country long enough I think  She sets about picking her strawberries again  SCENE II  Eugenia Lord Cornwallis the Officer  Lord C  whispering the officer  Yonder is the house where we were told Captain Greville lives he will be very much surprized and pleased with what I bring him a dismission from the service with such honour But what charming little girl is this I will stop and have a little conversation with her so do not you address me by my name  To Eugenia tapping her upon the shoulder  Why you are very hard at work I see my pretty child  Eugenia  Oh sir you frightened me  Lord C  I ask your pardon then my dear I did not mean to do so And for whom are you preparing all these strawberries They cannot but be very fine I think as they are picked by such a plump and snowy hand  Eugenia  holding out the hat  I beg then you will take some sir Do not be afraid for they are very clean I only wish I had a better plate to put them into  Lord C takes two or three as does the officer  Lord C  I never tasted any better do you sell them little dear  Eugenia  No sir though you were to give meI cannot tell how much  Lord C  You are in the right they are above all value being gathered by so sweet a little hand  Eugenia  Fie sir how you talk no it is not for that they should be at your service were they not intended for  wiping her eyes  my dear papa We have not gathered any for  m yet this season and perhaps these are to be the last that he will taste  Lord C  What my dear he is ill then and you think that he will die  The Officer  His illness however it is to be hoped is not yet quite desperate since he thinks of eating strawberries  Eugenia  No not that It is true indeed he has been troubled with the rheumatism all last winter to a very great degree and is not yet quite cured But cured or not he must set out tomorrow  Lord C  And pray why is his departure then so needful  Eugenia  Oh because his regiment then goes through the village and he must join it on the march  Lord C  His regiment  Eugenia  Yes my Lord Cornwallis's that is going to America  Lord C  aside to the officer  I would lay you any wager this is one of Captain Greville's children  Eugenia  overhearing him  Yes that is my papa's nameDo you know him  Lord C  Know him Why the gentleman and I are both his comrades  Eugenia  What and is the regiment so near then Will it go through the town today  Lord C  No not till tomorrow We are come my dear before it andand  aside to the officer  What excuse can I invent to serve my purposeAnd a wheel belonging to our carriage being broke hard by we thought to get a little shade here while it was mending And now every thing I fancy must be set to rights This path I take it leads directly to the road again  Eugenia  No sir it takes you to the village  Lord C  And the village I suppose belongs to your papa  Eugenia  Belongs to him I wish indeed he were so rich he has nothing but a little cottage with a garden this small grove and yonder meadow When he is not at the regiment he passes all his time here with us  Lord C  He was ill then in the winter  Eugenia  Yes indeed sir to our sorrow and he could not move a limb Besides a wound which he received many years ago below the temple has broke out afresh And now that he is almost well he must be forced to go again to meet with new misfortunes  Lord C  In such a situation why does not he sell out He might procure sufficient attestations from the surgeon  Eugenia  Oh mama did that in private for him but her letters never yet were answered Certainly the king refuses to believe her or perhaps  that  Lord Cornwallis who commands the regiment is so cruel  Lord C  Truly I believe my Lord Cornwallis would not like to lose so good an officer as your papa by whose  instructions I myself and all the younger officers may learn so much  Eugenia  And yet you do not appear so very young but are your papa and mama still living  Lord C  a little disconcerted  Do you doubt it  Eugenia  Oh I warrant you they cried at parting with you How could they consent to lose you I remember how much grief it caused mama and us when first my eldest brother went abroad to study and that is nothing in comparison of war  Lord C  I cannot tell that for I have left them after many separations in which case it is nothing to leave one another And besides when first I went to camp my father went with me  Eugenia  Did he Oh those fathers that are soldiers themselves are a little hard I can tell you but yet that is not the case with my papa He is so indulgent Why a child is scarce so gentle It is upon the point of honour alone that he can never be persuaded so that after all I fancy he himself is to blame and nobody else for his remaining still in the service  Lord C  Ay indeed How is that  Eugenia  Because he never asked for his dismission He is ever saying people would imagine him a coward should he quit the service during war He only wishes that he may always have but strength enough to sit on horseback and then he says he will part with every drop of blood he has to serve his country Well he will have his wish one time or other but we poor children then shall be without a father  Lord C  Recollect your father has been hitherto preserved from danger and why should he not continue still as safe It is not every musquet that hits  Eugenia  But those that do commonly kill their man and in the number may there not be one that will reach papa  Lord C  That is true indeed but what sweet little lady is this  Eugenia  My sister Mary Anne  SCENE III  Eugenia Lord Cornwallis the Officer Mary Anne  Eugenia  So Mary Anne you are come at last I see and where have you been staying  Mary Anne  Why mama would make me help her to do up papa's portmanteau  Eugenia  Where is the basket let me have it sister  Mary Anne  Have you gathered strawberries enough to fill it  Eugenia  You shall see  emptying the hat  Your pardon gentlemen  Lord C  Oh do not mind us  Whispering the Officer  What lovely children  Mary Anne  whispering Eugenia  Who may these be  Eugenia  whispering Mary Anne  Officers in Lord Cornwallis's regiment  Mary Anne  Do they come to fetch papa  Eugenia  No no they are before the regiment which will not go through the village till tomorrow as papa expected  Mary Anne  Ah would all the officers together with the regiment were at Jericho  Eugenia  Speak lower Mary Anne If the gentlemen should hear you  Mary Anne  Let them hear me if they like it What they come to take away papa and shall not we have leave to make complaint  Lord C  whispering the Officer  Methinks we are not looked upon very favourably here  The Officer  Then my lord why do not you discover yourself and mention the good news that you bring their father  Lord C  No Their openness delights me and the affection that they evince in favour of their parents ravishes my heart  Eugenia  to Mary Anne  Poor Douglas is hard at work while we are chattering here without once thinking of him I will go and help him Mary Anne stay you here and take care how you speak before these gentlemen  Mary Anne  Go go I know what is proper  Eugenia  This is my sister Mary Anne I present her to you gentlemen  Mary Anne  with a little frowardness  Your servant gentlemen  Lord C  She has a countenance as resolute as yours is timid  Eugenia  She will stay here to entertain you gentlemen for I must run and help my brother to gather strawberries so that all of us may go back the sooner to papa Will you permit me to inform him of your visitHe will be very happy to receive you  Mary Anne  No he will not be very happy to receive you nor we neither we should rather be pleased were we left alone at present  Eugenia  I hope your kindness will excuse this little madcap  Mary Anne  Oh yes to be sure Excuse me Why these gentlemen are sensible that little girls when strangers are at table must not speak a word and I have twenty thousand things to tell papa at parting which will otherwise go near to break my heart  Lord C  Dear children do not fear any thing you shall not be disturbed by us in your delightful conversation  Eugenia makes a grateful curtsy and withdraws  Mary Anne  But pray tell me gentlemen what reason has the king for thus taking away a good papa from us poor children Does he think that we do not want one to bring us up  Lord C  No no but then do you think that he does not want good soldiers to go abroad and fight  Mary Anne  And what necessity for fighting Or suppose that there should be any surely our papa in staying at home to give his children a good education would not be useless to his country  Lord C  No indeed especially my pretty Mary Anne if his other little ones improve as much as you do  Mary Anne  I believe you jest I know that I am thought a little forward in the family and I have heard it said that if I had but a cockade I could not fail to make a tolerable soldier  Lord C  Ha ha ha A little Amazon You would become a perfect hero  Mary Anne  I can tell you if I had only a sword I would not be laughed at  Lord C  Nay if that be all here is mine I will arm you with it  Mary Anne  Do I should be very glad  Lord C  presenting the sword and stooping to salute her  This is the first ceremony  Mary Anne  keeping him off  Softly softly I beseech you sir  Lord C  attempting it again  Oh you are a charming child  Mary Anne  running from him  Brother sister  Lord C  Mighty well Miss Soldier you are afraid of me then I see  Mary Anne  I afraid of you Oh no But do not however come too near or I shall run and fetch papa Papa is an officer as well as you are and will not suffer any one to hurt his little Mary Anne  Lord C  Heaven forbid that I should design to hurt you It was only done in joke  SCENE IV  Lord Cornwallis the Officer Mary Anne Eugenia Douglas  Douglas  coming boldly forward  You cried out just now Mary Anne I am come to your assistance  Lord C  Against us my little friend  Douglas  Against any one that hurts my sister  Mary Anne  Thank you brother but I did not mean to cry out quite so loud and have no need of your assistance for you see I have disarmed one However sir  returning Lord C his sword  for this once I grant you quarter But do not come too near in future I believe you understand me  Lord C  Why I vow you are an extraordinary little creature  Eugenia  I am charmed to hear you talk so but gentlemen at last we have gathered strawberries enough to share some with you  Presenting them the bushel  Take a sew let me request you  Lord C  No indeed we do not intend to touch them they have a destination more respectable than that we should think of making free with any  Eugenia  Those that you take will all be from our share and there will be no harm done should we go without You are in papa's own regiment and it is sitting that we shou'd treat you with as much respect as we are able  Mary Anne  taking a nosegay from her bosom and presenting it to Lord C  Ah on that account I will beg you to accept this nosegay I had gathered it for myself Papa and mama already have had one apiece or I could not have given you this but it belongs to me sir and I give it you  Lord C  And I my little dear accept it with the greatest pleasure  Mary Anne  It is somewhat faded by the sun but if you will stay a little I will go gather you some jasmin violets and jonquils in my garden  Eugenia  Mary Anne you remember I suppose the rosebush just before my window You may gather all the roses that are blown upon it  Mary Anne  Well sir shall I  Lord C  Would you have that kindness my dear child But no I thank you for the pleasure of conversing with you entertains me more than all the roses in the universe  Mary Anne  A thought strikes me Possibly you know what way an officer should take to quit the service honourably Could you not afford us some good counsel to procure papa's dismission  Eugenia  If you could we should be very glad to give you every thing in our power  Douglas  who has hitherto amused himself by playing with the hilt of Lord C  's sword and looking at his uniform  O yes if you could only tell us how to keep papa at home my drum spontoon cartouch box and accoutrements should all be yours  Mary Anne  with a smile  And I will give you free'y what you sought just now to take by force  Lord C  So many charming things at once Believe me if I did but know  Eugenia  sorrowful  You did but know So then we only make things worse and grieve you that you cannot be of service to us  Mary Anne  Oh I do not give up so soon My Lord Cornwallis colonel of the regiment will very soon pass this way Well then we three will go and throw ourselves before him hang upon his clothes and not let him go until he has granted our desire  Eugenia  Yes sister he shall see our tears and we will tell him how extremely ill papa was all the winter how indifferent he is at present and how much we should lament his going from us Do you think sir he would be so cruel as to send us from him and not grant us our request  Lord C  I cannot think that of him my good friends but if he be not come already on his way thus far there is room to fear that he will delay his setting out from London longer and you know in that case you would lose your pains as your papa must march tomorrow Happily however there is a gentleman his friend who can do every thing as if he were my lord himself and he is at present with the regiment serving as a volunteer  Douglas  A volunteer  Lord C  Yes so they call it one whose wish is to acquire a knowledge of the art of war assisted by my lord's instruction I can answer for it he will grant whatever your papa may wish for  Eugenia  And is he your friend  Lord C  Yes truly  Eugenia  Then for heaven's sake sir speak to him in papa's behalf that he may not be parted from his family who live but by his means and if he must leave England do you soften if you can his service and at any time should he be sick or wounded  Mary Anne  Wounded Do not wait sir till he is wounded but if a sabre should be raised against him run you in and save him from the blow  Lord C  aside  How difficult I find it to keep still concealedNo generous little souls fear nothing I will be answerable for his safety with my life  Eugenia  We may rely upon you then How much you charm us sir Yet do not upon that account forget to speak about him to the volunteer that you just now mentionedI could talk still to you on this subject but your heart will tell you every thing that I have left unsaid and  our papa whom we shall lose tomorrow must be waiting for us  Lord C  Go dear children but first take some trifle from me as a recompence for the agreeable halfhour that I have spent in conversation with you Here my sweet Eugenia take this ring it is a little too big but may soon be fitted to your finger  Eugenia  refusing the ring  No no sir mama perhaps would be displeased and so too would papa whose least reproach I would not deserve for the world particularly as he must leave us tomorrow  Lord C  You must absolutely take it Should he be displeased I will undertake to reconcile you with him when he joins the regiment if I cannot by my speaking to the volunteer prevent his leaving England  Eugenia  taking it  Well then he shall bring it you in that case and if otherwise I shall be very happy to remember you as often as I look upon it  Mary Anne  Come come sister it is high time that we should be gone  Lord C  And you my lovely Mary Anne I suppose would not be sorry to remember me See here is a copper etric gilt and at the top a composition stone they call it a false diamond  Mary Anne  looking at it  Yes I understand you but there is nothing false about it except your words It is gold I am certain and a real diamond I will not have it You have been a plundering for it My papa is a captain sir as well as you but cannot make such presents for he never went a plundering in his life  Lord C  Take take it there is no plundering in the case It would be useless to me in the field and therefore if you will not have it as a present keep it for me till such time as I return  Mary Anne  O that I will with all my heart  Lord C  And now perhaps you have a kiss to give me for security  Mary Anne  No no I have told you the conditions  Lord C  Well then I will do what I can to obtain them  Mary Anne  And I will keep the  you know what  sir till that timeCome brother  Douglas  Go you first I shall follow you immediately I have something to say in private to the gentleman  Lord C  I will speak with you this moment  The Officer who some little time before had withdrawn returns and gives my Lord a pocketbook they whisper one another  Mary Anne  whispering Douglas  What and should  you  like a present too  Eugenia  in a whisper likewise  Fie fie brother I should never have suspected you of so much meanness  Douglas  And fie  you  too sisters that can entertain so mean a notion of your brother I have something very different and much more important also that I should like to ask  Mary Anne  Well now if I were in a merry mood I could not but burst out a laughing at the gravity with which you speak of your important something  Douglas  Ay and were you not my sister I would make you squeak Miss Saucebox for suspecting me  Mary Anne  going out with Eugenia  Well manage your important something properly  SCENE V  Lord Cornwallis the Officer Douglas  Lord C  I am glad dear Douglas that you desire to stay We were not quite acquainted but at present and particularly as my friend here tells me that my chaise is not set to rights yet we shall have some more minutes to stand talking with each other  Douglas  So we shall but do not imagine that I remain here to get something from you  Lord C  How  Douglas  Because you gave my sisters each a present you might fancy that I want one but I protest sir I shall not take any thing  Lord C  Unluckily for me too I have nothing I can offer you  Douglas  Unluckily I am glad that you have not for now neither can be tempted  Lord C  aside to the Officer  I am charmed with his disinterestedness and never saw a lovelier figure  Douglas  I have but one question sir to ask you  Lord C  And what is that my friend  Douglas  You told my sister such a gentleman was with the army as a volunteer Pray what is a volunteer  Lord C  A volunteer is a soldier who may fight or not fight as he chuses  Douglas  Oh if I were to turn soldier it should be to fight and I would gladly be a volunteer on that condition  Lord C  But a volunteer must have a deal of money have you  Douglas  No but then the king has and pray is not he obliged to keep his soldiers  Lord C  No for as a volunteer is not obliged to fight it is but just that he should subsist himself  Douglas  I am sorry to hear this but if I wanted only bread and water or should beg the regiment to receive me sir instead of my papawhat then  Lord C  Poor child and what sort of a figure would you cut before a companyYou ought to have experience and authority  Douglas  If I have not enough of either to command I must have surely to obey Let me be any thing provided I may serve  Lord C  Would you be barely capable of following in the march  Douglas  I will go as far as I am able and when tired let me be lifted up among the baggage or I will ride upon the cannon Are you fearful that I should lag behind  Lord C  But if you were to serve instead of your para you do not remember that you must part with him as much as if he went himself  Douglas  And do not you think that I should rejoice to be the means of keeping him at home here with mama and sisters You would hardly lose by such a change Unhappily my dear papa will not be able to serve long and I shall very soon be what he was I love a soldier's business at my heart I know a number of marches and can play them on my fife Look here is a book of songs it is called the  Grenadier's Delight  I will give it you I know the whole by heart  Lord C  aside to the Officer  I have a thought  To Douglas  I would not wish better present and in turn I will give you not indeed a book of songs my little Douglas but a single son    Douglas  A song indeed I may accept  Lord C  feeling in his pocket  Hold here is in the first place one that you will give your father  Douglas  Oh he never sings sir now and likes no music but the cannon's  Lord C  That does not signify I am sure you will both be pleased with thisif you do but read it And here  taking a paper out of his pocketbook  is one for you  Douglas  jumping for joy  Oh thank you Let me see now if I know it  Lord C  No no Douglas you shall read them after we have left you  He puts the two papers together and thrusts them into Douglas's pocket  Let me put them in your pocket and do you take care not to lose eitherNow farewel my little friend and since you love a soldier's life I will have you for my comrade  Douglas  jumping up into his arms  Yes I will be so I will always love you and the first engagement that I enter I will be all the while at your side  The Officer  We will go and let the regiment know that you are coming  Douglas  Do and pray sir give me a good word  Lord C  retiring with the Officer  I feel how much the father's heart must bleed to quit such lovely children and rejoice on that account to be the bearer of such welcome tidings as the paper now in Douglas's pocket will inform him of Let us withdraw a little to some corner where we may unseen remark him  They get among the trees and Douglas has his eye upon them till they are out of sight  Douglas  alone and sitting for a little while profoundly thoughtful on the trunk then getting up and walking to and fro  Why should they desire to set papa a singing  Taking out the papers  Ha this paper is sealedthere is something fur  in it I suppose So let me see my own  Opening it  Is this a song It does not look like one The words go after one another all along the line  Reading  "I promise to pay to Mr Abraham Newland or bearer on demand the sum of fifty pounds" I do not know any tune that will suit these words  Reading again  "London December For the Governor and Company of the Bank of England John Larkin"He meant to make a fool of me I fancy when he called this a song It is all concerning moneyHo Captain Captain  going out after them  SCENE VI  Douglas Capt Greville pale and feeble Mrs Greville Mary Anne Eugenia  Capt Greville  Where where is he  Perceiving Douglas  Douglas where is my Lord  Douglas  looking about him  My Lord I have not seen the least bit of a Lord not I  Mary Anne  That handsome gentleman that talked with us  Eugenia  He that gave me this fine ring Papa says no one but a Lord could make so rich a present  Douglas  vexed  Blockhead that I was not to discover him  Eugenia  Oh what a fine fine gentleman  Mary Anne  So good and so familiar Oh my sweet etui I will keep you all my lifetime now  Capt Greville  How long has he been gone  Douglas  This moment I was running after him  Capt Greville  Tomorrow fortunately I shall join his lordship for it must be Lord Cornwallis it is his cypher that is engraved on the etui and I can tell him then how much my children are obliged to his benevolence I am sorry however that I had not an opportunity of asking him to lodge for one night with us Should you not have been rejoiced to entertain him children  Douglas  Oh yes yes papa He called me comrade when he took his leave  Mary Anne  For my part though I like him yet I am glad that he is gone for had he staid we should not have been able then to talk as if we loved you  Capt Greville  Mary Anne is in the right I should not have been free to mix my tears with yours dear children in his presence  Mrs Greville  And on that account I could wish to have had his company The violence that you must have done your sorrows would in that case have enabled me to keep down mine and since tomorrow we must lose you  Eugenia  Oh do not speak of that mama  Capt Greville  Dear children possibly I shall not leave you long Peace cannot be far off it is the wish of every one in England and no sooner shall that wish be gratified but I will instantly come back and never part with you again  Mrs Greville  But yet till things are settled you must unavoidably be from us and what comfort shall we have as long as you are absent  Eugenia  With what pleasure would I give him back his ring if he would leave you with us  Mary Anne  And I likewise his etui  Douglas  And I too his newfashioned song See see papa what he has put into my hand here Was there ever such a song before  Capt Greville  Let us see  Having read a little  What bounty is in this nobleman and what a charming way he has of obliging He has given you here an order for receiving a whole pocketfull of gold  Douglas  What has he tricked me When you see him give him back his money I will not have it But there is something else and he has given me likewise here a song for you  Capt Greville  A song for me my little fellow You are dreaming  Douglas  drawing the sealed paper out of his pocket  No no here it is  The children  smiling at each other and approaching their father with looks of curiosity  A song a song  Capt Greville  Good heavens what is thisThe king's coat of arms  He opens the packet with a trembling hand and looking at the signature cries out  and signet  Then casting his eyes over the three or four first lines breaks forth again  Is it possibleDear wife and little ones rejoice rejoice  Mrs Greville  If you stay with us  Capt Greville  Let me read the letter out  They all come round him and stand silent while he reads  Oh unexpected joy  Continues reading  No no it must be all a dream in which my pleased imagination forms the most brilliant chimerasAnd yet stay for I am awake and every thing is real though I never could have hoped for so much happiness  All speaking at once  Mrs Greville  I am dying with impatience to know every thing  Eugenia  Well well what is it dear papa  Mary Anne  You keep us all in pain  Douglas  Let me see your song  Capt Greville  embracing his wife and children  I am to stay with you my lifeWe are not to be separated my  children  Giving Mrs Greville the letter  Yes yes read yourself  Mrs Greville  I tremble every limb and cannot    unable to contain themselves for joy  Our papa stays with us Our papa stays with us  Capt Greville  Yes yes children I shall not go to America or leave you and yet still continue in the service in a way so honourable  Mrs Greville  coming to herself  And how how my life  Capt Greville  The king informed but by what means I know not of my illness and touched with my situation permits my staying here in England but to recompense my services these are h  s own words he confers upon me the command of Upnor Castle with the rank of colonel  Mrs Greville  What my dear  Eugenia  Joy joy  Mary Anne  So then papa there is not a greater man in all the army  Douglas  And you are colonel are you  Capt Greville  Yes and for the first time in my life entirely happy But my dearest life  to Mrs Greville  shall I be pardoned when I tell you such an honour is not on account of any step that I took to get itIt has come I cannot tell how  Mrs Greville  Yes yes I know that very well I did every thing in my power though what I did was never meant for such an honour joined to so much happiness They must be both however placed to the account of my solicitation  Mary Anne  Ah the naughty man say I but that mama took greater care of us than he did  Eugenia  So papa then you deceived us  Capt Greville  Yes my little deary but still what could I have done I have only this excuse to offer that  false modesty restrained me from requesting my dismission even though I should have thought myself unable to be of any real service to my country I was not however then quite sensible of my condition but now I feel it yes I feel within me that my constitution is no longer fit for the fatigue of arms  Mrs Greville  And this false modesty would have been death to me and have left these innocents without a father but that Providence has ordered your affairs much better Every thing however now is to be pardoned All my wish is that we had here the generous nobleman who brought us this glad news that we might thank him for his kindness to our little ones and also for his message which if the truth were known I dare engage he has in some degree been instrumental in procuring for what likelihood is there that I an unknown woman should by myself have so far succeeded beyond every thing that I could ever have wished  Capt Greville  At least if we had but been able to afford him the hospitality of one night's lodging with us  Douglas  Let us run different ways and overtake him if we can  Capt Greville  Go go It grieves me that I cannot follow you  Mary Anne  If we can meet with him and he will but accompany us back he shall have then instead of  one  three kisses  SCENE VII  Douglas Capt Greville Mrs Greville Eugenia Mary Anne Lord Cornwallis the Officer  Lord C  running from his hidingplace and laying hold of Mary Anne  Shall IA match my little maid  He kisses her three times  Eugenia and Douglas  My lord my lord  Mary Anne  a little out of countenance  You have almost frightened me with your kisses  Capt Greville  O my worthy general what words will shew you half my gratitude  Mrs Greville  How can my children and myself express our obligations To whom we are indebted for such a blessing we at present know not but your lordship is the  bearer of a paper which to me restores a husband and a father to my children  Lord C  For this blessing you and they are debtors to the king I have done nothing but solicited his bounty wishing that I might prove the channel through which it should flow Hearing accidentally dear madam of your application I determined to support it with my little interest and if possible to get more than was solicited You owe this interference to my knowledge of the captain's merit being as I was convinced how much he had instructed his inferior officers and been of benefit to those above him Upon this account I did not think it reasonable that he should still be forced to serve among us when his infirmity made service painful to him And still more to shew how heartily I prosecuted this affair with pleasure I took advantage of our march so near his habitation to bring down myself the news of my success and glad the bosom of his spouse and children with it This believe me is a joy that I shall never forget  He holds out his hand to Capt Greville who clasps it with transport  Capt Greville  And is it possible that I should have met with such a generous friend who of his own accord has seconded an application which the affection of a valuable wife was making for me but without my knowledge No one who had less than your benevolence my lord could have so heartily endeavoured to promote the happiness of an afflicted family  Mrs Greville  Then likewise you have made such princely presents to my children  Eugenia  I am now ashamed that I took this ring I did not think it to be of so much value  Lord C  I must own it is pretty but much more so on your charming hand It is indeed so altered I no longer know it  Mary Anne  Neither would you I suppose sir your etui and therefore I will not speak a word about it  Douglas  As for me I give you back your song It is not what you meant to let me have  Lord C  Then be it a mistake and since I have already made it pardon me to which I hope your good papa will add another favour that his Douglas may be made an ensign I will give order for it if he chuses  Capt Greville  If I chuse my lord You are the guardian angel sent to succour us  Douglas  But is it in your regiment  Lord C  Yes my little friend  Douglas  Ah how rejoiced I am I will go this moment with you and the name of my papa shall not so quickly be forgotten in the army  Capt Greville  You have conferred so many favours on mewould you vouchsafe me now one more that I am about to ask  Lord C  I apprehend your meaning and so far from not vouchsafing beg you to bestow it namely an asylum in your house for one night for my companion and myself  Capt and Mrs Greville how respectfully  Provided however that Miss Mary Anne consents  Mary Anne  Oh since my papa is to remain among us stay as long as you think proper  Eugenia  I may hope now my lord that you will consent to eat a few more strawberries  Mary Anne  You will make them no less sweet to us than I imagined your arrival would have made them bitter  Douglas  Yes my lord come in and honour my papa by eating with us and hereafter I will do every thing in my power to deserve a second honour like itin your lordship's tent  GEORGE AND CECILIA  LITTLE George an orphan had been brought up from his infancy by L  dy Eustace who together with Lord Eustace were retired from London and resided in a small country town From the tenderness with which they treated him a stranger in the family would have imagined him to be really their son This worthy couple had but one child left them and that a girl named Cecilia who was nearly of an age with George and Lady Eustace had the satisfaction to behold a more than common mutual sondness subsist between the children  One delightful morning towards the end of August George and Cecilia with their little friend Lucinda whose parents lived that summer in the neighbourhood were out a sauntering in the orchard The two little girls of which the youngest namely Cecilia was not yet quite eight years old were arm in arm and walking with that lovely negligence and those unstudied graces so peculiar to a state of childhood they hummed over a delightful roundelay then fashionable in the mouth of every songster in the village while little George preceded them at leisure piping on an English flute to harmonize their discords  What a series of delightful gambols entertained them in the or  hard But at last our Cecilia and Lucinda both cast a longing look upon the fruittrees round about them In particular an appletree attracted their attention All the apples had been gathered several days before but still a few that had been overlooked were here and there discovered hanging and the deep vermillion that tinged them and which the leaves could not entirely hide invited as it were the hand to come and take them George sprung forward climbed the tree which they were admiring and threw down as many apples as his hand c  ld reach while the children held their aprons open to receive them  Chance so ordered it that two or three of what were thought the finest fell into Lacinda's who piqued herself upon this accidental distribution as she might have done with reason had it been a predetermined preference since George was in reality the prettiest and politest little fellow in the place  Lucinda with a joy and triumph in her eyes that looked like insult thus addressed herself to Cecilia "Do but see how fine and large my apples are while yours are hardly  lf so h  some" Cecilia at these words hung down her head and putting on a serious countenance kept silence during the remainder of their wa  k It was in vain that George studied by a hundred assiduties to bring the little maiden back to reason to spread a smile again upon her cloaded countenance and to make those lips pronounce a syilable whose prattle ha  till then been so agreeable  Not long after this Lucinda took leave when they had got upon the terrace and were near home Before they entered George addressed his sister as he always called her asking why she seemed so angry with him Certainly you cannot be offended said he that Lucinda had her share of the apples You know very well I have always loved you most and would have shewn it in the tree by throwing you the finest apples but I know not how it chanced my dear they fell into Miss Lucinda's apron Could I take them from her Ask yourself that question And besides I thought you far more generous than to take offence at such a trifle You shall see the very first occasion that presents itself of showing you my real sentiments it was not my design to vex you  Heydey Mr George said Cecilia and who told you that I was vexed Suppose Miss Lucinda's apples had been even ten times finer than what I had is that any thing to me I am no glutton and you know that very well sir neither should I in the least have minded it but for the saucy little creature's looks I'll not endure them that I won't and as for you fall down upon your knees this instant or I will never while I live forgive you  O I cannot do that by any means said George bending half his body backwards as he spoke for by doing so I should confess a fault with which you have no right to charge me I am no storyteller and must say it is very wrong in you Miss Cecilia if you will not believe that I did not mean to vex you  Very wrong in me replied the other Very wrong in me What do you mean sir But I see why you affront me thus it is because Miss Lucinda is your favourite And so saying and bestowing a contemptuous curtsy on him while she looked another way she went into the house in a pet  As dinner was now ready they sat down but pouted at each other all the time it lasted Cecilia did not drink even once because she must have said  Your good health George  And George on his part was so piqued at her injustice that he also thought proper to preserve his dignity And yet the little lady would steal a glance still every now and then at George and from a corner of her eye consider all his motions As it happened one of  these sly glances met with one of George's who was no less slily studying Cecilia's motions Being thus surprised she turned immediately towards another object and as George took this to proceed from disdain though in reality it did not he affected great indifference and went on eating just as if he did not care a farthing for her  When the cloth was removed and the wine and sruit brought in unluckily poor Cecilia mortified as she was at George's whole behaviour replied a little disrespectfully to her mama who had besides been obliged to ask her the question twice over and she was therefore ordered instantly from table She obeyed and bursting out into a flood of tears withdrew as if she knew not whither she was going As the door was open that conducted to the garden she passed out that way and as it were by instinct went to hide her sorrow in an arbour at the bottom of it There while she burst out again into a flood of tears and sighed most lamentably she repented of the quarrel that she had picked with George who always used upon such sad occasions to alleviate her distress by weeping with her  George remaining at the table could not think of Cecilia in c  sgra  e and not feel greatly for her situation They had har  ly let him take two peaches before he set about contriving means to convey them into his pocket for po  r Cecilia whom he designed afterwards to visit in the garden upon some pretence or other which he did not doubt but he should be able to invent and yet he greatly appre  ended that his intention would be discovered He pushed back his chair and asterwards brought it forward more than menty times and was continually looking down for something on the carpet Then all of a sudden Look at pretty Laura look at Rover cried he seeming to take notice of two dogs in the apartment and at the same time he had got a peach ready to slip into his pocket if he could but fix my lord's and lady's observation upon something at a distance from him  See papa mama how prettily they are playing Do but turn about they will make you die with laughing  Oh re  d my lord they will not eat one another that I will answer for and having just glanced at them put himself so soon into his first position that poor George  who thought himself that moment sure of pocketing the peach was disconcerted and obliged to put it down again upon the table  Lady Eustace had observed him and conjectured his intention therefore having for a while enjoyed the little boy's embarrassment she made his lordship privy to the affair as well as she was able and in dumb show bade him turn his head on one side which he did accordingly but could not hide a smile that notwithstanding all his gravity escaped him  However George who thought himself as yet quite undiscovered but was fearful lest this device again repeated might betray him instantly resorted to another stratagem He took one peach and placed it in the hollow of his hands put both together after which he lifted it to his mouth and made as if he had really been eating by an imitation of the noise and motion which people make when they are chewing Then while with his lefthand he luckily found means to clap his peach into a cavity that he had hollowed beforehand in the napkin on his knees he put his righthand out to take the other which he served exactly in the same manner  Some few minutes had now passed and as it happened my lord and lady had quite forgot little George and were conversing with each other in their usual manner so that George supposing this a proper opportunity to get away rose up from table with both peaches in the napkin and began to imi  te the mewing of a cat which a young shepherd boy had lately taught him and his view in this was to engage the attention both of Pompey and Rover which he did and put them into motion Lady Eustace somewhat angry at these mewings interrupted him "What now" said she and added "Well but George if our discourse displeases you I fancy you may go and mew a little in the garden" George put on a feigned embarrassment at this reproof which was another thing that he wanted He runs up therefore to Laura saying "See mama she wants to bite poor Rover" and in turning he dexteroussy whipped the napkin all at once into his pocket and pretended to run after Laura with an intent to punish her Laura scampered towards the door which Cecilia had left  open when she went into the garden and away went Master George pursuing him  "George George said Lady Eustace pray where are you going" George stopped short "My dear mama said he I will take a turn if you please in the garden Won't you let me I am sure you will give me leave" But afterwards as her ladyship returned no answer he lowered his voice and in a suppliant manner added "Pray my dear mama do let me You shall see how well I will behave myself" "In that case answered she I will give you leave Go"  What words can express the greatness of his joy He was so joyful that not minding how he ran his foot slipped and he fell down By great good luck the peaches were not damaged in the fall He got up again instantly and ran to seek his sister in every nook and corner of the garden  George was got by this time to the arbour where he saw poor Cecilia wonderfully changed and in an attitude of sorrow and repentance She was now exceedingly unhappy She had grieved the three best friends that she had her worthy parents and her own dear George  "My sweetest Cecilia" said George and fell down on his knees before her "Let us be friends I would freely ask forgiveness for my fault if I had really intended to displease you Yet if you will ask my pardon I will ask yours also Will you Come forgive Cecilia let us be friends again Here here are two nice peaches I could not think of tasting them as you were not to have your share"  "Ah my dearest George said Cecilia squeezing his hand wh  she spoke and weeping on his shoulder what a good sweettempered little fellow I have always found you C  inly continued she and sobbed while she spoke certainly a friend in one's misfortunes is a real friend indeed But I will not take your peaches It would have been pitiful behaviour in me had I been vexed this morning for the loss of half a dozen apples You do not think that I was George do you No it wa  the insulting look with which that pert Miss Lucinda viewed me but I will not think about her now Will you forgive me added she and with her handkerchief wiped off the tears that she had let fall on George's hand I  know I sometimes love to plague you but keep your peaches now I will not eat them"  "Well then sister answered George whenever the fancy comes into your head e'en plague me just as long as you think proper Yet I will never let another do so You understand me But as to these two peaches I cannot eat them I have told you so already and was never guilty of a story"  "No nor I said Cecilia and that moment flung them both away into the public road I cannot endure the thoughts of having made a quarrel up for interested reasonsBut as we are now close friends again how happy would it make me if I could but get mama's permission to appear and ask her pardon"  "Oh I will fly and get it for you answered George and hardly had pronounced the words when he was got a good way from the arbour I will inform mama continued he that it was I who made you anger her by having vexed you in the morning"  In effect he succeeded sooner than he expectedIndeed what errors would not any reasonable woman overlook in favour of a friendship so affectionate and generous  THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION  Mrs Cranfield Helen her daughter  Helen  NO mama I had much rather finish this purse  Mrs Cranfield  But then Helen Caroline would certainly be a great deal better pleased with the workbag Do not you recollect she seemed delighted when you showed her yours and the bag that you have above stairs is made exactly like it  Helen  Notwithstanding that mama I know she would like the purse a great deal better  Mrs Cranfield  Be it so but will the purse be finished There are still at least a dozen rows to do whereas the workbag only wants a ribband to compleat it Sure you  would not pay a visit to your cousin on her birthday and go there without some present for her  Helen  O mama you know I should not like to do so but believe me you shall see the purse very soon finished  Mrs Cranfield  Think before you come to any resolution in the affair Your father I suppose you know sets out at four o'clock exactly and if any one among you has not finished what she had to do that one will not go with him  Helen  He sets out at five o'clock mama not four  Mrs Cranfield  Helen will you never be rid of this shocking trick Will you always be determined to assert the absolute reverse of every thing that your hear  Helen  But if I am sure that papa sets out at five and not before  Mrs Cranfield  Well well Helen it will very soon be seen which is in the right But I advise you as a friend to be prepared against the hour that  I  mention  Helen  O if that be al  mama you may be sure to find me ready even at four for look ye it is as one may say quite finished I should gain a quarter of a hour beside were I to run and work below there in the garden  Mrs Cranfield  Why so pray  Helen  Because it is so much lighter there  Mrs Cranfield  But sure you will lose a deal of time in going thither and returning  Helen  O do not fear but I shall recover it again My work  ll go on ten times the better for it  Mrs Cranfield  As you please Helen but remember I have forewarned you what may be the case  Helen  I will take the consequence upon myself and run as fast as possible  In fact she did run thither very fast so fast that she arrived quite out of breath She wanted more than half a dozen minutes to recover and at last when she was set at work her hands were in a tremble owing to her flurry so that she frequently took up one stitch for another In the end when she was quite recovered one must own she pushed her work on very fast And yet in spite of all her diligence it seemed to grow beneath her fingers Mrs Cranfield who was really uneasy came to find her  Mrs Cranfield  Well Helen how goes business forward Have you finished  Helen  No not yet mama nor is it five o'clock yet  Mrs Cranfield  Right Helen but it is four the clock has just struck  Helen  Not struck mama I have been listening so I am sure of that  Mrs Cranfield  I do not know how it came about then that I heard it and your father must have heard it likewise for you will find that he is setting out  Helen  O now I am sure you are joking that can never be  Mrs Cranfield  However Dick has put the horses to and here are your brother and your sisters coming They are ready  Helen  O dear me You do not say so mama  The Brother  coming forward  Where are you Helen We are waiting now for none but you  Helen  One moment brother  The Brother  Four o'clock has struck and you remember papa at dinner told us that he should go precisely to a minute having an appointment here at half past five  Mrs Cranfield  Well now Helen you remember what I told you  Helen  But mama  Helen's three sisters enter crying out  Helen come come come  Helen  vexed  Do not be in a hurry children  The Brother  How Helen have you not done your purse yet See here the little landscape that I shall give my cousin  First Sister  And this bowpot which will be my present  Second Sister  And this housewise of my making for her  Third Sister  And these garters that I have knit her But here comes papa  Mr Cranfield  coming in  Well we are setting out You know Helen I never make any one wait for me therefore never do I stay for others If you are ready come along but if not remain behind  Helen  My purse is not done yet I have but two short rows to finish  Mr Cranfield  beckoning the other children to follow  Well good bye Helen I will give your love to Caroline and say that you wish her well and happy on her birthday  They go out  Helen  crying  They are setting out and I must stay at home quite melancholy I that waited with so much impatience for this day Caroline will have a present from every one of them and I the eldest am not of the party What will she think of me  Mrs Cranfield  In reality the case is pitiable I must own and more particularly so as it depended on yourself alone to shun this mortifying situation I forewarned you what would be the case in proper time and if instead of being obstin  ely bent to go on with your purse you had but put a ribband to your workbag if you had not lost so many minutes as you did in running hither if you had not taken it into your head from the first that your father was not to set out till five you would have faved yourself all this vexation The misfortune is now come and you have only to support it as you ought with patience  Helen  But my aunt and uncle what will they think of me They will imagine that I am in disgrace or else that I do not love my cousin  Mrs Cranfield  You must own Helen they will have some reason to suspect as much  Helen  Ah dear mama instead of lessening you increase my sorrow  Mrs Cranfield  No Helen I am no less sorrowful than you but then if you think proper I can end your sorrow  Helen  Ah now you are quite good Yes yes I will make an end as soon as possible and then we two will take the purse My uncle aunt and cousin too will be agreeably surprized and see that my coming so late was not my fault I suppose then you will send out to fetch a cousin and in the mean time I shall finish  Mrs Cranfield  No Helen that would be to disobey your father and deprive you of the benefit accruing from a useful lesson You shall not at least today go see your cousin but may have it in your power to be as happy  as you would have been by going I have a certain method to propose to you for that purpose  Helen  And what is it pray mama  Mrs Cranfield  To form from this time forward a determined resolution not to settle matters just as you yourself think proper to renounce particularly that intolerable trick that you have of contradicting everlastingly whatever you hear said and to rid yourself of the vile habit of opposing your own ridiculous ideas to the counsels of such people as you know to be wiser than yourself I am persuaded you have sufficient courage to take up any resolution and to support it  Helen  Yes indeed mama I will I will so  Mrs Cranfield  I expected nothing less from you Helen and if during the remainder of the week I see you persevere in your laudable resolution we will go next Saturday and see your cousin We shall then carry her the purse and the workbag also which will make her think that you have delayed your present with a view of complimenting her with something worthier of herself and more expressive of your generosity  Helen  embracing her mama  Oh dear mama once more you make me happy  Mrs Cranfield  You Helen make me no less happy Possibly this very moment you are laying the foundation of your whole future happiness  CAESAR AND POMPEY  MR Saunders had brought up two handsome dogs one Caesar and the other Pompey He had named them so not with the wish or expectation that they should one day become rivals like the two illustrious commanders whose names they bore but though both were littered at a birth had always fed together and been treated with an absolute equality yet it was not long before they manifested very different tempers  Caesar was extremely meek and docile Pompey rough and quarrelsome  The generous Caesar jumped for joy when any one caressed him and never took it ill that his brother should  be fondled in the same manner but the surly Pompey on the other hand whenever Mr Saunders had him in his lap would growl if Caesar met with the least notice the least smile or token of affection  When the friends of Mr Saunders coming on a visit brought their dogs our Caesar would immediately get in among them and endeavour to amuse his company and as his nature was extremely pliant and insinuating and his manners very winning they were always at their ease whenever it was his part to entertain them They would play and frisk about the apartments just as if they had been all at school with one another The good Caesar did his utmost to set off their beauty and activity that Mr Saunders might be pleased with their appearance and induced to do them some good turn or other  What did Pompey do in the mean time He would get into a corner and be all day barking at the strangers If unhappily they drew too near him he would then be sure to grin and snarl and often bite their tails or ears And if his master noticed any one among them for his breeding and good parts he would howl with all his might as if the house was robbing  Mr Saunders had remarked this odious temper some time past in Pompey and begun already to neglect him Caesar on the other hand gained something every day on his affection  On a certain day as he was set at table he resolved to try their dispositions more than he ever yet had done They were both attending at the table Pompey being nearest for the honest Caesar to avoid dissension always gave him up with pleasure the foremost place and Mr Saunders held out Pompey a nice piece of juicy meat which he immediately fell a chewing Caesar was not discontented in the least at this but waited with the greatest good humour till his turn should come His turn soon came but Mr Saunders threw him nothing but a hard dry bone He took it without any sign of discontent but hardly had the churlish Pompey observed Caesar busy with his share though much inferior to his own than he rejected with disdain the bit between his teeth and fell on Caesar to obtain his bone The gentle Caesar made no manner of resistance but imagining that it might please the fickle taste of Pompey yielded it at once  Do not think my friends that this condescension on the part of Caesar was the effect of cowardice or even weakness in him He had given ample testimony of his strength and resolution very lately in a contest where he had been engaged on account of Pompey whose intolerable surliness had drawn down upon him the resentment of a dog that lived in the neighbourhood He had not fought above five minutes though it was he himself who had previously provoked the fight before he ran away while Caesar though without a friend to take his part continued the engagement like a hero and acquired at last such glory as to make his adversary bite the dust  This anecdote his master knew and as his character for courage was so thoroughly confirmed he made him take the bit of juicy meat that he had before thrown to Pompey but which Pompey had rejected "Caesar my good fellow said his master it is but just that you should enjoy your brother's portion since he first took yours and therefore eat it"  Pompey scowled at Caesar seeing the affection that accompanied these words in Mr Saunders's countenance and Mr Saunders added "Since you have shewn yourself thus complaisant and generous towards him who treats you with such j  alousy and envy you shall be in future my own dog and range about the house as you think proper but your brother shall be tied up in the yard so quick a chain for Pompey and let some one bid the carpenter this moment knock up a kennel for him" Accordingly this last was instantly conducted to his station while the other had his liberty to walk about the apartments  Pompey would very probably have enjoyed with insoleace so great a mark of favour had  he  gained the advantage in his master's judgment but the heart of Caesar bled at the idea of his brother's sentence and he essayed all means to soften his condition When the servants gave him any thing he would be sure to carry it to Pompey wag his tail with pleasure and invite him to regale upon it and at night he would not fail to visit Pompey in his house amusing him in the midst of his sufferings by all possible means and for hours together warming his benumbed limbs  But Pompey far from being softened by such kind actions never welcomed Caesar to his kennel nor received him otherwise than with continual howlings so that very quickly after rage inflamed his blood his heart was ulcerated and his entrails perfectly dried up  You children who read this if there be any one among you of a disposition such as Pompey had consider what a miserable lot awaits you and reflect upon his punishment You will otherwise lead a life of sorrow and humiliation and expire in horror  THE LITTLE GIRL WITH WHISKERS  "WON'T you do what I bid you then Mr Obstanacy Come sir obey or else you will be the worse off for it I can tell you" Thus Camilla a pert little vixen of whom we are now going to give an account was perpetually rating and commanding her poor brother  Might her word be taken for it he did every thing amiss on the contrary whatever she thought of doing was a master piece of reason and reflexion The diversions that he proposed were always dull and heavy in her judgment but forgetting this decision when the next day came she would most probably chuse them herself as the liveliest and most entertaining Her unhappy brother was obliged on pain of being soundly lectured to obey her whims and fancies If he durst attempt to shew her the unreasonableness of her procedure she would be that moment in her airs his play things then were sure to go to ruin and himself was forced to mope without amusement in a corner of the room  Camilla's parents had a hundred times endeavoared to break her of this fault Her mother in particular was always telling her that people never gained the love of others if they were not complaisant and gentle that a little girl who would on all occasions set up her own will by way of law for others would be found the most intolerable creature in the universe These prudent lessons or instructions made no manner of impression on her heart Her brother sick of so much tyranny began already to  lose something of his love and kindness for her and Camilla was so far from shaking off her domineering disposition on that account that she became a hundred times more arbitrary and insulting  As it chanced a gentleman of understanding and who was always remarkably sincere and open in his speech and conduct dined one day upon an invitation with Camilla's parents He observed with what a haughty air she treated her poor little brother nay and every body in the room At first through mere politeness he kept silence but tired out ere long with her impertinence he began addressing his discourse to Mrs Fleming her mama as follows "Had I such a little girl as yours I know what I would do"  What sir said Mrs Fleming  You shall hear replied the gentleman I am lately come from France and as I liked to see the soldiers exercise I amused myself by visiting the grand parade where the soldiers are drawn up as frequently as I had leisure Among the soldiers there were many that I observed with whiskers and one cannot but acknowledge they looked very fierce as soldiers should Now had I a child like your Camilla I would give her instantly a soldier's uniform and I would clap a pair of whiskers on her and make her a Swiss Corporal so that she might completely satisfy her passion for commanding  Hearing this Camilla stood confounded She could not refrain from blushing and even wept  From that time forward she was sensible how much a tyranizing disposition misbecame her and resolved to shun the mortifying consequences which it would soon or late bring down upon her This resolution assisted by the prudent counsels of her mother quickly proved successful  Such a change was doubtless very prudent on her part It were however to be wished for all young ladies labouring under such a fault that they would yield obedience to the kind instruction of their parents on this subject and not wait till such time as a man of understanding tells them to their face that they would look better in a surly soldier's uniform with whiskers than set off with nice white cambrick frocks like all goodnatured little ladies  THE SCAR  FERDINAND from nature had received a soul endued with elevated thoughts and generous notions He possessed a lively turn of mind a strong and quick imagination with a chearful temper His whole person in a word and his polite behaviour won him every heart  However with so many amiable qualities he had a certain great defect extremely inconvenient to his friends of giving way to every slight impression and yielding up his soul to the emotions which any accidental circumstance might raise within him  When he sought amusement in the circle of his playmates trifling contradictions ruffled his impatient disposition and they saw the fire of rage in a moment inflame his whole countenance he stamped upon the ground cried out and was beside himself with passion  Once upon a time as he was walking in his chamber to and fro and meditating on the necessary preparations for a treat which his father had permitted him to give his sister Marcian his dear friend and favourite intended to communicate his notions on the subject Buried as he was in thought he saw not Marcian Marcian therefore having called out to him but in vain drew nearer and began to pull him by the sleeve but Ferdinand disturbed and out of patience with these interruptions unexpectedly turned round with so much rudeness that he sent poor Marcian quite across the apartment to fall down beside the wainscot  Marcian after he dropped lay still without the least appearance of life To which I am to add that in falling he had siruck his head against the moulding of a bookcase and received a wound as Ferdinand then fancied in the temple whence there came a deal of blood  Heavens reader what a shocking prospect was this for Ferdinand who never had intended any harm to Marcian and for whom he would have even lost his life if there had been occasion  Ferdinand fell down beside him lamentably crying out He is dead he is dead I have killed my friend Instead  of trying any means for his recovery he remained stretched all along uttering dismal groans Happily his father heard him he came running up took Marcian in his arms and having laid him on a bed called out for salts and threw cold water in his face which recovered him a little  The return of Marcian to new life transported Ferdinand with joy but as he might relapse it was not great enough to take away entirely his anxiety  A surgeon being sent for probed the wound He found it to be not in the temple but so very near it that the difference of a hair's breadth in its position would have made it dangerous indeed if not quite mortal Being carried home he soon became delirious  Ferdinand could by no means be persuaded to leave Marcian He took up his station by his dear friend's pillow and maintained the profoundest silence Marcian frequently pronounced the name of Ferdinand while his delirium lasted My dear Ferdinand he would say in what had I offended you that I should be treated thus Yet it is quite impossible that you should be less afflicted than myself for having wounded me without the least degree of provocation Let it not however grieve your generous nature I forgive you and do you forgive me likewise Ferdinand for having put you as I must have done into a passion It was not my wish to vex you  This discourse which Marcian thus addressed to Ferdinand without observing him though present and even holding him continually by the hand redoubled his affliction Every word proceeding from the lips of Marcian as it served but to proclaim the greatness of his friendship was a poignard to the heart of Ferdinand  At last however it pleased God for Ferdinand's great consolation to assuage the violence of the fever In ten days time the patient was enabled to get up  What tongue can represent the joy of Ferdinand It is not to be comprehended certainly by any one unless he himself has felt beforehand the sorrow which Ferdinand experienced all the while that he was a witness of his friend's distressful situation  Marcian being at last thoroughly recovered Ferdinand resumed his former chearful humour and not needing any other lesson than the sorrowful event that had so late y  happened he laboured hard to overcome the vehemence of temper to which he had been a slave  Marcian in a very little time had no mark of the accident remaining but a trifling scar as just now mentioned near the temple Ferdinand could never see this scar without emotion even when they were both come to years of manhood It became in short the seal of that much closer friendship in which they were ever afterwards mutually united  THE SILK SLIP  LITTLE Matilda had worn nothing but a plain white frock till she was eight years old Neat red Morocco shoes with silver buckles set off her small feet her ebon hair which had never yet felt the torturing iron floated in large curls upon her shoulders  She had been one day in the company of certain little girls who though not older than herself were dressed already like great ladies and the richness of their cloaths awakened in her heart the first vain notions that she had ever had within it  Dear mama said she returning from the house where she had met with these fine ladies I have seen this afternoon the three Miss Flowerdales I suppose you know them The eldest of them must be younger than myself O dear mama how sweetly they were dressed Their parents sure must have a deal of pleasure seeing them so fine I dare say they are not so rich as you so give me if you please a fine silk slip with such embroidered shoes as they had on and let my hair be dressed by Mr Frizzle who they tell me is extremely clever  The Mother  I desire no better if to do so will contribute to your satisfaction but I fear with all this elegance you will find yourself not quite so happy as you have been hitherto in the simplicity of such plain things as you generally wore  Matilda  And why so mama  The Mother  Because you will be eternally afraid of spotting and even of rumpling what you wear A dress so  elegant as that of the Miss Flowerdale's will require the greatest care and attention in the wear that it may do you honour If it gets one spot the beauty will be lost for ever as one cannot put it in the washtub to recover its first lustre and however rich you may suppose me I shall not be rich enough to let you have a new silk slip whenever you may want one  Matilda  Oh if that be all mama do not make yourself uneasy I will be very careful of it  The Mother  Will you Well then I must give you such a dress but still remember that I have hinted what uneasiness your vanity may cause you  Unpersuaded by the wisdom of this counsel Matilda did not lose a moment in destroying all the pleasure and enjoyment of her infancy Her hair which had till then hung down at liberty was now to be confined in paper and squeezed close between a burning hot pair of tongs and that fine jet which had till now so happily set off the whiteness of her forehead was to disappear beneath a clot of powder and pomatum  Two days after Matilda had a handsome slip brought home of peagreen taffety with fine pink trimmings and a pair of strawworked shoes to match them The taste that appeared in her cloaths their vivid colour and elegance of makecharmed the eye but when she had them on it was evident that her limbs were under great constraint her motions had no longer their accustomed ease and freedom and her infant countenance amidst so vast a quantity of flowers silk gauze and ribbands lost entirely every trace of ingenuous simplicity  She was notwithstanding quite enchanted at her metamorphosis Her eyes with mighty satisfaction wandered over her whole little person and were never taken off except when she looked round about her to find out some glass in the apartment that might represent before her at full length the idol which she then worshipped  She had wrought on her mama to send out cards of invitation to her little friends that when they came to visit her she might enjoy a feast in viewing their surprise and admiration When they had all met together she walked to and fro before them like a peacock and from her behaviour any one would have imagined that she  supposed herself an empress and considered those about her as subjected to her empire But alas this triumph was but of a very short duration and a multitude of mortifying circumstances followed it  The children were permitted to go out a walking in the fields near that part of the town where she lived Matilda therefore led the way and they reached in ten or fifteen minutes a delightful country  A luxuriant meadow first of all attracted their attention It was every where enamelled with a vast variety of charming flowers and butterflies whose wings were of a thousand mingled colours hovered in each quarter of it The gay little ladies hunted these fine butterflies they dextrously caught but did not hurt them and when once they had examined all their beauty let them go and with their eyes pursued the little creatures as they fluttered to and fro They employed themselves in making nosegays likewise of the flowers that sprung up in the meadow which they gathered for that purpose  Matilda who from pride had first of all disdained these mean amusements wanted very soon to share the entertainment that they afforded but the ground they told her might be damp in which case she would stain her shoes and damage her fine slip for they had now discovered that her intention in thus bringing them together was to vex them only with a sight of her fine clothes and they resolved to mortify her in their turn  She was of course obliged to be solitary and sit still while she observed the sprightly chearfulness of her companions who sported round about her The delight of contemplating on her peagreen slip was compared thereto a very sorry kind of entertainment  At the corner of the meadow there was a sort of little grove in which was to be heard the music of a thousand birds that seemed as if inviting every person who went through the meadow to go thither and enjoy the coolness of the shade This grove our children entered jumping as they went along with joy Poor Matilda would have followed them but she was told that the bushes would tear all her finery to pieces She observed her friends to divert themselves at  pussey in the corner  and pursue each other through the trees The more she heard  them shout with joy the more as any one might have expected she was peevish and illhumoured  But the youngest of her visitors had some sort of compassion on her She had just found out a corner where there grew a quantity of fine wild strawberries and therefore beckoned to her to come and eat part of them She would willingly have done so but had scarcely got into the grove when unexpectedly a loud cry was heard The children gathered to the spot and found poor Matilda fastened by the gauze upon her hat and ribbands to a branch of white thorn from which she could not by any means disengage herself They made haste to loose the pins that held her hat on but to add to her affliction as her hair which had been frizzed with so much labour was likewise entangled with the branch of white thorn it cost her almost a whole lock before she could be set at liberty and thus all at once the charming superstructure of her headdress was absolutely pulled to pieces  'Tis not difficult to guess how little this misfortune thus befalling Matilda touched her playmates when they found as we have said already why she had invited them Instead of consolation which she needed and perhaps expected they could hardly keep from laughing at her comical appearance and did actually jeer her with a hundred wicked witticisms After having smoothed her down a little they ran off in search of fresh amusement towards a hill that they saw at some small distance from them  Matilda however could not without very great difficulty reach this hill Her strait shoes which had been made so to set off her little feet the better were a great obstruction to her speed nor was this all the mischief for her stays were drawn so close that she could not easily fetch breath She would have now been happy to go home and change her dress in order to be at ease but then she knew that her little friends would never have consented upon her account to be deprived of their amusement  They had got by this time to the summit of the hill and were enjoying the fine view which a spacious horizon presented them on every side They saw on one hand verdant meadows on the other yellow harvests before  them rivulets meandering through the country and by way of termination to the landscape a large river on whose banks were many pleasant country houses So magnificent a prospect charmed them They even danced about with joy while Matilda at the bottom of the hill for she was absolutely out of breath and could not possibly get further was devoured with sorrow  She had time and opportunity enough in such a situation to make many sad reflexions To what purpose said she to herself are these fine clothes how much pleasure do they not prevent me from enjoying and what pain do I not suffer merely from having put them on  She was giving up her mind to these afflicting thoughts when suddenly she heard her friends come running down the hill and all cry out together as they passed her Run run Matilda there is a dreadful storm behind the hill it is coming towards us if you do not make haste your slip will soon be wet quite through  Matilda felt her strength returning at the fear of such a great misfortune as her playmates threatened She forgot her weariness her pinched feet and her tight lacing and made tolerable haste to reach some place of shelter But in spite of all her efforts to shun so grievous a misfortune as the spoiling of her clothes she could not run so fast as her companions who were lightly dressed Then too every moment she was stopped at one time by her hoop and flounces in the narrow paths by which she was obliged to go at another by her train which was frequently caught fast by the furze and at others by the fine seaffold work about her head on which the wind bent down the branches of those trees under which she was forced to pass in her way homeward  At that moment too the storm burst forth in all its fury and there fell a shower of hail and rain mixed together after all but Matilda had regained their several habitations  In the end however Matilda got home likewise but wet through and through She had besides left one of her fine shoes behind her in a heap of dung which as she hurried homeward she had scrambled over without seeing it and to increase the list of her disasters she had not  quite cleared the meadow when a gust of wind blew off her hat into the middle of a dirty pool of water  They had all the trouble that one can possibly imagine to undress her so much had the sweat and rain even glued her shift and other garments to her body so that her whole dress was spoiled and absolutely good for nothing  Shall I have another slip my dear made up for you against tomorrow said her mother drily seeing her in tears  O no mama said Matilda kissng her I am convinced fine clothes can never make the wearer of them happy Let me take up with my nice white frock again and have no more pomatum in my hair till I am eight or ten years older than at present and forgive my folly  Matilda with the dress of childhood came again into the full possession of her liberty and seemed as modest and as charming as she had ever been Neither did her dear mama regret the loss that she had experienced in the purchase of this fine silk slip c since it proved the means of reinstating her beloved daughter in the happiness which her vanity and folly would have taken from her had it not been for this useful lesson  THE FIRE A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  MR and MRS CRESWELL  ADRIAN  their Children  JULIA  their Children  TRUEMAN  a Farmer  JANE  his Wife  LUBBIN  their Children  SUKEY  their Children  GILBERT  Mr Creswell's Groom  SCENE  The entrance of a village in the environs of London in a part of which contiguous to the fields appears a fire On one side is a farmhouse with a pump and on the other side a hill  SCENE I  Adrian running by a path that conducts round the hill His clothes and hair out of order He looks back and sees the fire burst forth with double fury  O Heaven O

the holidays Had I remained at school I should at least at present have known nothing of this day's misfortune O papa mama O sister  Jane  Poor dear child there is no cause to make yourself uneasy On the first alarm of fire so near your quarter of the town my husband instantly set out to see if he could be of any use I know him Your papa mama and sister will be safe if mortal man can save them But my lovely Adrian you have been up and running these two hours at least and must be hungry Will you eat a little  Lubbin  Look ye master here is a Yorkshire cake and butter Take it  Adrian  Master You were used to call me Adrian and not master  Lubbin  embracing him  Well then Adrian take my breakfast  Sukey  Or stay Adrian you must certainly be dry as well as hungry I will go fetch my milk pottage I was putting in the bread  Adrian  No no my good friends I cannot have any appetite till I see my dear papa mama and sister I will return and seek them  Jane  Do you think of what you are saying Run into the flames  Adrian  I left them in the flames but it was against my will I did not like to part with them but my papa would have it so he threatened me and in an angry tone bid Gilbert pay no heed to my resistance I was forced at last to yield for fear of putting him into a greater passion I cannot hold out any longer but whatever be the danger I must go back to find if they are in safety  Jane  I cannot let you go that is certain Come into the house with us  Adrian  You have a house then Alas I have none  Jane  And is not our house your's I fed you with my milk and surely then I cannot deny you bread  She forces him in and says to Lubbin  Take care and stay you here that you may see your father the sooner and let us know of his comingBut do not run to see the fire Remember I forbid you that  Lubbin  alone  And yet I have half a mind to do so What a charming bonfire it must make I do not see clearly but I think that steeple is down that had the golden dragon on the top There is many a poor soul by this burnt out of house and home I pity them and yet they must not hinder me from finishing my breakfast  To Sukey who reenters with a tumbler  Well now sister you are a dear good girl indeed to bring me drink so kindly  Sukey  Oh it is not for you I am come to get a glass of water for poor Adrian He will have neither milk nor ale nor wine "My dear papa says he mama and sister very likely are at present dry and hangry and shall I have such nice things No no indeed let me have therefore nothing but a little water that will serve me well enough especially as I am so thirsty"  Lubbin  One must own however it is something comical that Adrian should refuse a drop of any thing that is good because he cannot get tidings of his parents  Sukey  Oh I know you well enough Your sister might be burnt alive and you not eat a mouthful less on that  account For my part I should be like Adrian I should hardly think of eating if our house were set on fire and no one could inform me what had happened to my father mother or even brother  Lubbin  No nor Iprovided I were not hungry  Sukey  Can one then be hungry in such a case Look ye Lubbin I have not the least degree of appetite To see poor Adrian weep and take on so has made me quite forget my hunger  Lubbin  So you won't eat your milkpottage this morning  Sukey  What you want it after having swallowed your own breakfast with Yorkshire cake into the bargain  Lubbin  No I would only take your breakfast that if neither you nor Adrian wished to have it nothing might be loft that is all But let me have the tumbler I have not drunk any thing yet  Sukey  giving him the tumbler  Make haste then Adrian is very dry  Lubbin  after drinking  Stay stay I will fill it for him  Sukey  Without rincing it  Lubbin  Do you suppose then that I have poison in my mouth  Sukey  Very proper truly with the crumbs about the rim I will rince it out myself Young gentlemen are used to cleanliness and I should wish to let him see as much propriety and neatness in our cottage as at home  She rinces the tumbler fills it up and then goes out  Lubbin  alone  So there is my breakfast done Suppose now that I should run to town and see the fire I shall not be missed if I set out stay there but half an hour or so and then come back it is nothing but a good sound scolding from my mother However I will go a little way and then determine It is not more than twelve or thirteen minutes' walk before I am there Come come faint heart the proverb tells us never won fair lady  He sets off but meets his father  SCENE III  Lubbin Trueman with a chest upon his shoulders tired and out of breath  Lubbin  What you are come back father I was going on a little way to meet you  Trueman  with anxiety  Were you And is Adrian here  Lubbin  Yes yes not long ago arrived  Trueman  putting down the chest  Thank God then the whole family are safe  He sits down upon the chest  Let me take breath a little  Lubbin  Won't you come in father  Trueman  No no I will remain here in the open air till I am recovered from my hurry Go and tell your mother that I am returned  Trueman  alone wiping his face  I shall not die then without having in my turn obliged my benefactor  SCENE IV  Trueman Jane Adrian Lubbin Sukey  Jane  running from the farmhouse and embracing Trueman  Ah my dear what joy to see you come back safe  Trueman  embracing Jane in return  My life But Adrian where is he pray Let me see him  Adrian  running up  Here I am Here here father  Looking round about him  But what are you alone Where is my papa mama and little sister  Trueman  Safe my child quite safeEmbrace me  Adrian  jumping up into his arms  O what joy  Jane  We have been all in very great perplexity Our neighbours are come back already  Trueman  They had not their benefactor to preserve as I had  Jane  But the fire dear Thomas is it out and all the mischief over  Trueman  Over Jane the whole street is in flames If you could only see the ruins and the multitude of people Women with their hair about their ears all running  to and fro and calling out to find their husbands and poor children to which add the found of bells the noise of carts and engines with the crush of houses when the timbers are burnt through the frightened horses and the throng of people driving full against you I cannot tell you how I made my way amidst the flames that crossed before me and the burning beams that seemed ready every moment to fall down and crush me  Jane  Bless us you make my blood run cold  Sukey  See see mother how his hair and eyebrows are all singed  Trueman  And see my arm too But why should I complain Could I have only got away with life I should not have mattered losing a limb for Mr Creswell  Jane  How my dear a limb  Trueman  What wife to save our benefactor Was it not through his means that we both came together Are we not indebted to his generosity not only for this farm but for every thing And what is still more my jewel was it not your milk that reared his weakly child now so strong and hearty  Adrian clings to Jane  Did I say that I should not have mattered losing a limb for Mr Creswell I say more I would have given my life to save him  Jane  Then you have been able to assist him  Trueman  Yes I have that happiness to boast He himself his lady and his daughter had scarce got out of their house as they supposed in safety when a halfburnt beam fell down into the street before them Happily I was not ten yards off the people fancied that they were crushed beneath its weight and ran away I heard their cries came back and rushing through the burning ruins brought them off I had already saved this chest that you see here and my cart besides is loaded with the greatest part of their most valuable furniture  Adrian  Be sure my father will most richly recompense you  Trueman  I am recompensed already my dear little friend Your father did not perhaps expect such a service at my hands and I have saved him In that thought I am much better paid than in receiving any recompense But this is not the whole I dare say he will be here presently and all his family and people  Adrian  What then shall I see them soon  Trueman  Yes my Adrian But run wife and make a little preparation to receive them let some ale be drawn and have the cows milked instantly Air sheets to put on all our beds and as for us we will take up our lodging in the stable  Jane  Be it so I will play my part I warrant you  SCENE V  Trueman Adrian Lubbin Sukey  Trueman  And I will go put the hay up in some kind of order in the barn and make a little room for those who may come hither requiring some shelter All the fields alas are covered with them I imagine I still see them some struck speechless gaze with absolute insensibility while they behold their houses burning or else fall down on the ground fatigued and frightened others run along like madmen wring their hands or pull their hair up by the roots and uttering fearful cries attempt to force their passage through a line of soldiers who with bayonets keep them off that they may save the property of the sufferers from being plundered  Sukey  O my poor dear Adrian had you been there they would have trod you under foot  Trueman  As soon as they bring back my horses I will go out again and take up all the children women and old men that I meet Had I been the poorest person in the village this misfortune would have rendered me the richest since the unhappy whom I shall succour will belong to me  He stoops to take the chest up  Lubbin  Dear father let me help you  Trueman  No no have a care it is far too heavy for your strength Go rather and bid Humphry heat the oven and put all our kitchen things in order and let Carter know that I want some flour sent in these miserable people who are burnt out of their habitations shall at least find wherewithal to satisfy their wants Thank God I am not so poor that any one applying to my charity should die for want of food If I had nothing else I would give them my last bit of bread  He and Lubbin go out  SCENE VI  Adrian Sukey  Sukey  Oh  that  I would share with you too Adrian Who alas would have supposed that I should have ever seen you in your present situation  Adrian  Who indeed my dearest Sukey for it is very hard in one night to lose every thing  Sukey  Be comforted however my dear friend for do not you recollect how happy we were once together here when we were less a great deal than at present Well we will be as happy with each other again Do you fear that you can want any thing as long as I have any thing to give you  Adrian  taking Sukey by the hand  No I do not indeed but then I thought it would have been my part to make you happy to get you a good husband as papa has often said in joke and to take care of your children like my own  Sukey  Well now I must contrive to do all this myself and when we love each other it is exactly the same thing I will get you all the finest flowers that I can make free to pull in our garden and whatever fruit they will let me gather You shall also have my bed and I will sleep all night long upon the ground beside you  Adrian  embracing her  O my dear dear Sukey how I ought to love you  Sukey  You shall see likewise what care I will take of Julia I will be always with you both We drank you know the same milk and is not that all the same as if you were my brother pray and I your sister  Adrian  Yes and you shall always be my sister and I do not know which of the two I shall love best for the future you or Julia I will present you also to papa that you may be his daughter but when think you will he come  Sukey  Why make yourself uneasy You have been told that he is safe  Adrian  But my father is just like yours and who can tell but he will go back again into the flames to save some  friend or other I must therefore be uneasy till I see him once again But hark ye do not I hear a tread on the other side of the hill Oh if it were he  SCENE VII  Adrian Sukey Gilbert  Adrian  Ah Gilbert  Gilbert  Ah my little master you are safe then  Adrian  Truly there is great need to talk about my safety Where is papa mama and Julia are they with you  Gilbert  not knowing what to say  With me  Adrian  Yes you have not left them behind sure  Gilbert  Behind  Turning about  They are not behind me  Adrian  They are not come with you then  Gilbert  Unless they be here I do not know where they are  Adrian  impatintly  You do not come here to seek them do you  Gilbert  in confusion  Do not be frightened my dear little masterAre they not come hither  Sukey  None but Adrian  Adrian  He is confounded and has some bad news to tell meThey are lost even after all the pains that honest Trueman took to save them  Gilbert  Hear meThere is no cause at least I hope not to alarm yourself About an hour or forty minutes after they had forced me from you to assist the sufferers I found means to get into the crowdDear Master Adrian do not be frightened but so it is indeedI ran about the ruins to discover where my master was but could not come at any tidings of him no nor of my mistress nor Miss Julia I enquired of every one that I met if they had heard of such a family but constantly was answered No  Adrian  O Heaven take pity on me Dear papa mama and Julia where where are you Perished doubtless  Gilbert  I have not told you all yet but pray do not be frightenedThe worst part of the affair comes now  Adrian  What is it then Why do not you tell me Gilbert  Gilbert  How in Heaven's name would you have me tell you if you let yourself be frightened in this manner  Adrian  Speak pray Gilbert speak  Gilbert  Well then the rumour was as follows that a gentleman a lady and a little girl were crushed to death when they were just got out of doors and thought themselves in safety  Adrian swoons away  Sukey  Help help help Come here to our assistance some one Adrian is dying  She falls down by him  Gilbert  Why what ails him I mentioned this but as a report and besides they could not tell me who it was It may be nothing after all  Sukey  Why how you talk His fright at what you mentioned overcame him and he quite forgot that my father had preserved them  Gilbert  feeling Adrian's cheek  O my poor dear little Adrian he is as cold as any ice  Sukey  half getting up  And what could bring you here It is you that have killed him  Gilbert  IAnd yet I am sure you heard me bid him not be frightened  He raises him a little  Master Adrian  He lets him fall again  Sukey  How you go to workDo not touch him any moreHe will die if he is not dead already with such treatment O my dear dear brother AdrianFather mother LubbinWhy where can they all be  She runs in for help  Gilbert  leaning over Adrian  No no he is not dead he breathes a little Were he dead I would go and fling myself this moment into some pond  He calls out  Adrian Master AdrianIf I knew but how to bring him to himself  He blows on Adrian's face  This blowing tries my lungsIt was very foolish I must own in me to tell him what I did but much more so in him to pay attention to it and particularly when I bid him not be frightenedCould I possibly speak plainerAdrian AdrianHe does not hear meWhen my dear wife died I took on very sadly for her but to die on that account would have been very sillyAdrian Adrian  What had I best do He does not seem as if he would recover Ah I see a pumpI will go and fill my hat with waterHalf a dozen sprinklings very possibly may have a good effect upon him  As he is coming back to Adrian Mr Creswell enters leading in Mrs Creswell and Julia Gilbert drops his hat and runs away  Gilbert  Heaven forgive me Should he find him dead I do not know what he will do For my part I am dead with fear already  Mr Creswell  Was not that our GilbertGilbert what is the matter Where is Adrian  Mrs Creswell  Sure he ran away as if afraid of meeting with us Where can he have left him  Julia  seeing Adrian on the ground  What is this here A child  Stooping down  O Heaven my brother and he is dead  Mrs Creswell  falling down by Adrian  How Julia AdrianYes indeed help help  Mr Creswell  Was this misfortune wanting after all  Examining the body  But he is not deadThank Heaven we are better off than that He breathes a little My dear life  to Mrs Creswell  as Adrian needs assistance keep your strength that he may have it  Mrs Creswell  nearly swooning  Adrian Adrian  Julia  Ah my poor dear brother Would to Heaven the flames had rather taken all from us  Mr Creswell raises Mrs Creswell and brings Adrian to her  Mr Creswell  There is no time to loseHave you your salts about you  Mrs Creswell  I cannot tell I am in so great an agitation After so much fear and fright here is one still greater I would part with all that is left us for a draught of water  Mr Creswell sees the pump and hastens to it  Julia  feeling in her mother's pocket  Here is your sal volatile mama  While the salts are using  Hear hear hear me Adrian and look up or I shall die with grief  He comes a little to himself  O heavens he breathes  She runs to her papa  Come come papa come quickly come and see him  Mr Creswell brings a little water in the hollow of his hand and throws it on his face  Adrian  sighing bitterly  Oh oh Papa papa  Mr Creswell  He supposes I am dead That blockhead Gilbert must have frightened him  Julia  in transport  See fee his eyes begin to open  Mr Creswell  My dear child do not you know us  Mrs Creswell  Adrian Adrian  Julia  Brother  Adrian  looking round him  Am I dead or living or where am I  He sits up in Mrs Creswell's lap  Ah my dear mama  Mrs Creswell  My child and have we brought you back to life  Adrian  turning to his father  Papa too  Julia  embracing him  My dear Adrian my sweet brother I am alive again now you are  Adrian  Oh what joy to see you thus again dear sister  He turns to his mother  It was your sweet voice mama that brought me back to life  Mr Creswell  to Mrs Creswell  My dear I was lamenting our misfortune just before but now I find that there was a great deal more to be lost than goods and such things  Mrs Creswell  Let us not think a moment more about them  Mr Creswell  Nay rather we should rejoice that they are in reality so trifling I behold you all three safe and can have nothing to disturb me  Julia  But brother what brought you into such a situation  Adrian  Would you think itGilbert  Mr Creswell  There I said so  Adrian  Why he told me that you had all three perished in the flames  Julia  looking towards the hill  Ah there he is papa above there  They all look up and Gilbert draws his head in  Mr Creswell  Gilbert GilbertHe's afraid to answer  me  so do you call him Adrian  Adrian  GilbertDo not be fearful but come down and show yourselfI am alive  Gilbert  on the hill  Are you sure of that  Adrian  I think so Did you ever hear a dead man speak  Gilbert  coming down but stopping on a sudden  You do not intend I hope sir to discharge me If you do I need not be at so much trouble to come on  Mr Creswell  See simpleton the consequence of speaking without thought  Mrs Creswell  A little more and you had been the death of Adrian  Adrian  Pray mama forgive him It was not his fault  Gilbert  No certainly I bid him not be frightened  Adrian holds out his hand  However I am glad that you do not intend me any harm and for the future I will think no one dead till such time as I see him ten feet under ground and fairly buried  SCENE VIII  Adrian Mr and Mrs Creswell Julia Trueman Jane Lubbin Sukey  Trueman  running in  O the wretch where is he  Sukey  shewing Gilbert  Look ye father here  Gilbert slinks behind his master  Trueman  Who is this  Sukey and Lubbin run towards Adrian who presents them both to Julia the farmer bows to Mr Creswell  Mr Creswell  taking him by the hand  My friend what means this humble distance With such respect to bow before me my preserver and not only mine but all my family's  Trueman  Yes sir it is another obligation that you have laid upon me I have had the opportunity of showing you my gratitude for all your favours  Mr Creswell  You have done much more for me than ever I did yet for you and more than I shall ever have it in my power to do  Trueman  What say you sir The service of a moment only I on the other hand have lived these eight years past by means of your bounty You observe these fields this farm from you I had them You have lost your all permit me therefore to return them It will be happiness enough for me that I shall always have it in my power to say I have not been ungrateful to my benefactor  Mr Creswell  Well then my good friend I  do  permit you to return them but on this proviso to enrich you with much better You have luckily for me preserved my strong box that had all my writings in it and those writings are the best part of my fortune so that to you I owe the preservation of my whole property Having now no house in London I will go down into the country whither you shall follow me and we will fix our habitation at a seat that I have in Norfolk All your children shall be mine  Adrian  Ah dear papa I meant to beg as much See here is my sister Sukey and here is Lubbin my brother If you knew the love and friendship that they have shewn to me Possibly I might have now been dead but for their kindness  Mrs Creswell  grasping Jane's hand  Henceforth we will be but one family and all our happiness shall be in loving one another like relations  Jane  In the mean time enter and repose yourselves Excuse us if our cottage cannot afford you the accommodations that we certainly could have wished to do  Trueman  looking towards the hill  I see my cart sir and a number of poor people following Will you give me leave to go and offer them the service of which they are so much in need  Mr Creswell  I will go with you and console them likewise I am too much interested in the melancholy accident that has distressed them though far less a sufferer by itLess I should have said no sufferer but a gainer for the day which I supposed at first to be so unfortunate gives me back much more than I have lost It gives me in return for such things as with money I can purchase what is far beyond the value of all moneya new family and friends who shall therefore be henceforth precious to my heart  THE GREAT GARDEN  MR Sage had received no very great inheritance from fortune and his parents but was not without the happy secret of limiting his desires to what he possessed and notwithstanding he was frequently obliged to go without a number of conveniencies and comforts which others could command by means of their abundance never did one envious thought disturb his equability of temper He had never suffered more than one affliction of considerable magnitude arising from his want of this life's comforts and that was the loss of an affectionate and virtuous woman torn from his embraces by the hand of death A charming little fellow Polydore Sage was the only child remaining to console him and the education of this charming little fellow was the single object of his study and attention  Polydore was endued by nature with very strong imagination and by this his father had found out the happy secret of improving his reason at a very early time of life namely by exhibiting before him every object in its real point of view of which he had beforehand only given him an idea By a series of strong images arranged in order and selected in a proper moment to produce their full effect he had enabled him already to make many accurate and deep reflexions  Satisfied with his condition this good father wished particularly to inculcate in his son those principles to which he owed himself the calm of his condition and the peace within his mind Yes often would he whisper to himself if I can but accustom him to live contented with his humble fortune and point out to him the folly of putting any value upon what he must not hope to obtain I shall contribute more to make his manhood happy than by leaving him a heap of gold and silver  Occupied incessantly on this important lesson he thought fit one evening to accompany his son to Vauxhall Gardens for the first time in his life Immediately on entering Polydore was struck with admiration and delight The perfume of the flowers the beauty of the paintings the wellordered disposition of the walks the  crowd of men and women who were in them elegantly dressed the incessant motion of the multitude the hum of their discourse the noise of the cascade all joined to attract his contemplation and his eye considered at one view ten thousand objects His good father seeing him if we may say so swallowed up in thought conducted him to that part of the gardens which was more retired from public observation that his senses which were too much occupied by such a crowd of images might be in some degree at rest Soon after he proposed indulging him with some refreshment if he liked itPolydore gladly took his father's offer and soon after having satisfied his appetite and palate spoke as follows  How extremely happy every one here present seems to be I should like papa if we had such a charming garden Did you notice what a number of fine carriages were at the door And all those gentlefolks that pass us how well dressed they are I should be glad to know why we must live so savingly when others in the world indulge themselves with every thing that they fancy I begin papa believe me now to see how poor you are But why then are so many around us rich They are not better people sure than you papa  You speak exactly like a child replied the father  You begin to see how poor I am  Now I can tell you I am quite rich  Polydore  And where then are your riches  Mr Sage  I have a garden bigger by far than this  Polydore  A garden You papa I should be glad to see it  Mr Sage  When we go into the country you shall see it  They went very soon it being now the season for taking the pleasures of the country and on the very day of their arrival at the countryhouse not far from London Mr Sage took his son and led him up a hill from whence the eye commanded an extensive prospect On the right was seen a spacious forest whose extremities seemed lost at the horizon On the left appeared a beauteous mixture of fine gardens verdant meadows and vast fields quite covered with the promise of a plenteous harvest Close below the hill was stretched a valley watered in its whole extent with a thousand little rills  and all this landscape was in motion There were fishermen in one part busy with their nets and husbandmen who in another were employed in gathering fruits and herbs and sportsmen with their greyhounds urging the swift stag and shepherds watching by their flocks or playing near them in the shade and reapers carting their last sheaves and dancing all the way before them as they proceeded homeward This delightful picture captivated Mr Sage and his son who for a time kept silence till the child began the following conversation  Papa when shall we reach your garden  Mr Sage  We are at it now my child  Polydore  But this is not a garden it is a hill  Mr Sage  Look round as far as you can see for this I tell you is my garden Yonder forest and these fields are all my property  Polydore  Your property papa You are joking  Mr Sage  No indeed I am not I will convince you in an instant that I dispose of every thing all around us as the owner of it only can do  Polydore  It will delight me to be sure of that  Mr Sage  If you had all this country what would you do with it  Polydore  What the owners of estates generally do  Mr Sage  What may that be  Polydore  In the first place then I would cut down a deal of timber and make firewood of it to be used this winter In the next place I would go a hunting to catch venison and sometimes I would fish I would breed sheep and oxen and in harvest gather in the corn that covers this fine country  Mr Sage  Why you comprehend the matter admirably Polydore and I am glad to find our notions are so like each other's Well whatever you would do then I already do and I will convince you of it  Polydore  How papa  Mr Sage  I say then in the first place I have men who cut down for me in this forest all the wood that I want  Polydore  And yet I never heard you order them to cut down any for you  Mr Sage  And why not because they have the forethought to prevent me We have always a good fire  below and sometimes too up stairs Well then I have the wood brought to me from the forest to keep up those fires for here you know we cannot get coals to burn as if we were in London  Polydore  You have indeed the wood brought to you from this forest but must pay for what you have  Mr Sage  If I were what you call the real owner of this forest should I not be forced as I am at present to pay for what I might have brought me from it  Polydore  No indeed papa It would be cut down for you and sent in without a penny cost on your part  Mr Sage  You believe so do you On the contrary I think the cost might be a great deal more in that case than at present for you will grant if I possessed the forest I must keep at least a woodman to cut down the trees for firewood  Polydore  Well pass over this but can you go a hunting  Mr Sage  And why should I hunt Polydore  Polydore  For instance to have venison  Mr Sage  Could we two then eat a buck or doe ourselves entirely  Polydore  We should have a charming appetite to do so  Mr Sage  Well then as I cannot go a hunting I send huntsmen in my place and very probably the venison that you have seen hang up at Charingcross where as you remember you went with me lately to buy some was hunted in this forest I can therefore without hunting venison have as much as I think proper  Polydore  For your money  Mr Sage  Well and is it not a charming thing for me that I can come at venison on these terms for I have no wages to pay to those who hunt it for me or provided they should shoot it I have neither to supply them with gun nor ball nor powder Those various kinds of dogs that our squire maintains thank Heaven they eat up nothing that belongs to me  Polydore  Are those cows too and sheep that graze in yonder meadow yours  Mr Sage  Yes truly Have not you fresh butter every day I get it from those cows  Polydore  But papa if all these flocks and all those little rivers too are yours why have not we at dinner  every day all sorts of meat and fish as other rich folks I am told have  Mr Sage  Do they eat up every thing that their servants set before them  Polydore  No but they may chuse at table whatever they like  Mr Sage  And as for me I make my choice before my victuals come to table Every thing that I want I have Superfluous things it is true I do not possess but what benefit would they procure me if I had them I should want in that case a superfluous stomach also  Polydore  Wealthy people make good cheer but you papa I fancy do not  Mr Sage  Indeed I do and better than the wealthy Polydore I have a sauce that almost always fails them namely a good appetite  Polydore  And have you then a deal of money as they have to satisfy a thousand wishes  Mr Sage  Much more money or at least what is better I have no wishes  Polydore  I believe however there is a deal of pleasure in contenting them  Mr Sage  A hundred times more pleasure child in being content of one's self as I am  Polydore  But does not God pray love the rich a great deal more than you since he bestows upon them so much gold and silver  Mr Sage  Polydore do not you recollect the wine that we had last Wednesday on the table when your uncle came to dine and sup with us and which you said was so delicious  Polydore  Yes papa I remember you were so good as to give me half a glass full of it  Mr Sage  But you wanted more I might have let you have it since you know the bottle had a deal left in it even after supper why then did I not oblige you pray  Polydore  Because you were afraid that it would make me ill  Mr Sage  I recollect I told you so and do not you think that I did right  Polydore  Oh as for that you did indeed I know you love me and are always studying how to make me happy  So you would not have refused me such a trifle as a glass of wine if you had thought that it would have pleased me and not hurt my health  Mr Sage  And can you think that God loves you less than I do  Polydore  No papa I cannot after what I have heard you say so often of his goodness  Mr Sage  On the other hand do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and silver in abundance  Polydore  No more difficult than I should find it to give any one a handful of the dust that we tread  Mr Sage  On the other hand do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and silver in abundance  Polydore  No more difficult than I should find it to give any one a handful of the dust that we tread  Mr Sage  Well then if as you acknowledge he is able to bestow these on you and does not bestow them even though he loves you what are you to think of his refusal  Polydore  That the riches which I desire from him would be hurtful  Mr Sage  Are you perfectly convinced of this  Polydore  Yes perfectly and have not a word to say against Yet papa  Mr Sage  Well why thus shake your head You have still some burthen on your heart what is it  Polydore  Notwitstanding all your reasonings I can never bring myself to fancy all this country yours  Mr Sage  And why  Polydore  Because you cannot enjoy it as you please  Mr Sage  You know the famous Mr Norton  Polydore  Do I know him Why that is he who has such charming gardens  Mr Sage  And can he enjoy those gardens as he pleases  Polydore  No indeed poor man he dares not even eat a bunch of grapes  Mr Sage  And yet you have seen some very fine ones in his garden  Polydore  I have but they would do him harm  Mr Sage  You see then one may easily possess a number of good things and yet not dare to use them as one likes I dare not use my gardens as I certainly should like because my fortune will not let me and this Mr Norton dares not use his garden as he likes because his  health will not allow him So that I am much the happiest  Polydore  But papa you love to ride a horseback do not you  Mr Sage  Yes for it is an exercise that does me good when I have time to take it  Polydore  Well then if these meadows are all yours why do not you take the hay that grows upon them and in future keep a horse  Mr Sage  Why that is the very thing which I do And those same haycocks that you see there are po  bly intended for the horse that I ride  Polydore  And yet I never saw one in your stable  Mr Sage  Heaven be praised I am not at such a great expence  Polydore  Nor do you ride as frequently as you would like  Mr Sage  You are wrong for I am so prudent that I never wish to ride but when a ride would do me good and then I get it for about three shillings God be praised I am rich enough to pay that sum  Polydore  Do not you imagine that to have two fine piebald horses and to be drawn about the country in a fashionable coach would be very pleasant  Mr Sage  Agreeable enough but when I think of all the inconvenience that attends a coach how often one would want the harnessmaker smith and wheelwright how much one depends upon the health of horses and the conduct of a coachman and what risque one runs of being overset together with the fatal consequences which luxury too frequently occasionstruly Polydore I do not grieve that I am obliged to used my legs which certainly will last me long enough But see the sun is now set and we must think of getting home before the evening closes on us Let me have your hand Now are you not quite pleased in having seen my great estate  Polydore  Ah dear papa I should be much more so could I but be persuaded that it were yours  The father smiled at this reply and down the hill they walked together As it happened they went by a meadow which at first they thought had been a pond because it was quite covered with water Bless me cried out Mr Sage do you see this meadow how it is overflowed  The neighbouring river must have burst its bounds and all the hay this year is spoiled  Polydore  I fancy he to whom the hay belonged will not be very happy when they tell him of his loss  Mr Sage  No no nor yet is this the worst he will be forced to mend the banks and very likely make another dam Why he will be very happy if he does not spend in these repairs the produce of ten harvests that he could make in such a meadow  Polydore  Oh What a misfortune  Mr Sage  But I thought there had been a windmill hereabouts  Polydore  And there is papa Look there before you  Mr Sage  Right I see it now the reason is I did not hear it going I would lay any wager that the torrent coming down has forced away the wheelwork Let us go seeJust soIt is broke to piecesWhat will the poor owner do He must be very rich indeed to stand against so many l  sses  Polydore  On I pity him with all my heart But since the c  y is over pray why are the bricklayers still at work  Mr Sage  I cannot tell why We need but ask the reason Pray friend be so kind as to inform us why you work so late  A Bricklayer  We shall be here all night for yesterday when it was dark a gang of thieves pulled down the wall that they might get into the park and steal away the furniture that had been put into a new built summerhouse The theft was not discovered till this morning and indeed it is very lucky that no one caught them in the fact  Mr Sage  How so  The Bricklayer  Because the thieves had previously disposed combustibles to set the summerhouse on fire if they had been disturbed in plundering so that they might get away assisted by the bustle and confusion which such destruction would have caused The owner of this ground as you may judge is therefore very happy in his loss he might have seen his summerhouse burnt down whereas the affair will cost him now no more than some slight repairs to his wall the expence of keeping up a watch all night and buying other furniture instead of the former which indeed had cost him a good deal  Well Polydore now said Mr Sage to his son when they had walked a little way in silence what do you observe on these misfortunes Do not they grieve you  Polydore  Why should I be sorry I have suffered nothing by them  Mr Sage  But if this estate had been your property as Mr Norton's grounds are his and if when going out this morning you had seen your meadow overflowed your windmill broken to pieces your park wall demolished and your summerhouse robbed would you have gone home as satisfied as you appear to be at present  Polydore  Oh by no means I should on the contrary be miserable had I undergone so many heavy losses in a day  Mr Sage  But what if you had every day such losses to endure or to dread would you be as happy as at present  Polydore  I should be a thousand times more miserable  Mr Sage  Well then Polydore such is in reality the state of all who possess great abundance Without reckoning up the cares that agitate them and the innumerable wants which they fancyin the elevation of their fortune lies too frequently the cause of its decay A barren season or a false step in the pursuit of their rapacious projects frequently suffices to produce their ruin As they fear the loss of their imaginary consequence should they resolve upon some sacrifices to their luxury and pride the more they undergo distressing losses the more they suppose that they ought to make a sumptuous show to keep up the appearance of their riches and support a credit which already totters to its fall What then is the effect of such a wretched sort of vanity Their servants perhaps kept out of their wages an unseasonable time proceed to introduce a sort of robbery through all the house The improvement of their fortune and the education of their children being overlooked their lands in some sort as it were lie fallow or produce a blighted harvest only and their children left to riot in the ways of wickedness commit disgraceful actions which are stified by the necessary aid of money All their property when seized by inexorable creditors is in the end completely dissipated or else the law lays hold of what would otherwise be left them And these favourites of fortune once  so proud of their abundance elevated station and enjoyments fall at once to the lowest pitch of indigence shame an  pair  Polydore  Oh what a frightful picture is this papa  Mr Sage  It is one however daily to be seen in society and be  ssured there is not one exaggerated feature in the wh  le portrait I can at all times shew you in the public papers the dec  y of some great family or other and these striking instances God's providence exposes to the observation of the rich that they may see what fortune is most likely to await their pride and folly In the morning we will go and gaze on those fine buildings which excite your envy now where you may read the ruin of too many families inscribed on every pillar round about till they are swallowed up themselves in their own ruin Why alas can I not spare your sensibility the cries of many desolated families which are but too evincing tokens of such miserable revolutions  Polydore  What then should I look upon the mediocrity of our condition as a blessing meant us from above  Mr Sage  Yes yes if you are only frugal and industrious and possess sufficient resolution to renounce ambition and the immoderate wish of getting money of confining your desires and keeping them within the limits of that state you fill Do I want any thing to make me happy and in reason would you wish hereafter to be happier than your father is Consider the whole universe as your estate since if you are but properly industrious it will furnish you a comfortable maintenance God's providence has placed your earthly habitation half way up a hill whose summit is extremely craggy and its base choaked up with swamps Lift up your eye at intervals upon the rich and great not with a view to envy them their situations but to think upon the storms that bellow round them Sometimes too look down upon the poor beneath you not by way of insult on their friendless situation but to hold them out your hand If God should bless you with a family of children let them often hear the lesson which I have just now taught you but particularly give them in your life and manners that example which God's blessing has enabled me to afford you  By this time they were both at home The virtuous Mr Sage went up stairs into his chamber and there falling on his knees gave thanks to God for all the blessings which he had constantly received and offered him the sacrifice of his existence as the best return that he could make What need had he of being any longer upon earth His days had been replete with probity and honour and by giving such a lesson on contentment to his son he endeavoured as far as in him lay to endow him with a valuable patrimony such as no one could take from him  BLINDMAN's BUFF

 Friends to Frank  YOUNGER DANBY  who stutters Friends to Frank  ROBERTS  their acquaintance  Mr Jephson's groom  SCENE  an apartment in the house of Mr Jephson with a table and upon it books and other papers and a speaking trumpet in the corner  ACT I  SCENE I  Frank speaking to his father as he goes down stairs  NO no papa do not be afraid I will tal  the greatest care that no accident shall happen to your papers I will put up your books too in the closet  he comes for  ward jumping for joy  We shall have some fine diversion When the out is away the mice it is said will play  To Lucy who now comes in  Well now Lucy is mama gone out and all our little friends arrived  Lucy  My friends are all three come but none of your companions yet  Frank  O I can easily believe you sister We do not want to run a gadding like you girls and so we are not the first to keep appointments of this nature You must force us from our study if you would have us Look you I would lay any wager that the Danby's at least are hard at work while we are speaking  Lucy  Yes to settle what fine tricks they can contrive to put upon usBut pray Frank is it true that papa will let us pass the evening here our room above is so very small we could not have found room to turn ourselves well round  Frank  Could my papa refuse you any thing when I concerned myself to ask it Softly little girl do not discompose the papersLet them he  Lucy  Keep that advice sir to yourself I meant to lay them smooth  Frank  with an air of importance  No no you cannot miss I am charged with that commission  Lucy  Truly my papa could not have given it to so orderly a gentleman let me at least assist you then and afterwards I will put the chairs in order These great books I shall remove first  Frank  Do not think of touching them At most I can permit you only to take one by one and pile them up upon my hands  She does so till they reach his chin  Lucy  There is enough  Frank    aning backwards  One more onlySoI have no sufficient for one turn  He takes a step or two when all the books fall down  Lucy  B  ing out a laughing  Ha ha ha ha there there they g Those handsome books that papa would never let us to  h I fancy he will be greatly pleased to see them all t  bled together thus  Frank  I  lost the other of Gravity as my tutor says and you know he is Gravity itself  He picks the  books up but they tumble down as fast as he gathers them  Deuce take it They have been at Sadler's Wells I think and learned to tumble sure  Lucy  You will never finish if I do not assist you So d'ye see I will spread my apron and do you stoop down and pile them in it  Frank  That is well thought indeed  Frank goes upon his knees takes up the books and places them in order in his sister's apron  Lucy  Softly brother they will rub one against another So I have got them all and now I will carry them into the closet  She goes out  Frank  rising out of breath  Bless me I should never do to live a long time in the country where men go upon allfours like monkies  He fans himself with his hat  Lucy  reentering  Could you see how neatly I have ranged them on the chimney you would be charmed So let me have the rest  Frank puts the other books and all the paper's in his sisters lap who says when she receives them  Well every body must acknowledge that girls are cleverer than boys  Frank  O yes and you particularly Isabella is constantly employed in putting by your shreds and rags  Lucy  And if your tutor had not constantly his eye upon you you would never know where you should find your exercises and translations  She looks about her  But I fancy I have now got them all  Frank  Yes yes there is nothing left so get you gone  Lucy goes out  Frank  putting back the chairs and table in their places  There so that is done and we shall now have elbowroom enough I cannot help thinking what fine work we shall be sure to make However I am surprised that they are not come yet For my part I can say I hardly ever make any one wait for me when a visit is in the case  Lucy  entering once again and looking round about  Ay very well but brother you must hide this speaking trumpet If your friends should happen to perceive it they will be sure to stun us with their noise  Frank  Stay stay I will put it up behind the door as perhaps I shall want it Let your little friends come now and din me with their chattering as they used to do and we shall see who will cry out loudest  Lucy  Pshaw we need but join together we should very shortly get the upper hand of such a little thing as you  Frank  O no for if you ladies have your clappers so well hung we gentlemen possess a fine clear manly voice which every one respects as thusYou hear me  Lucy  shrugging up her shoulders  Yes and have so much respect as you say for you that I will take myself away Farewel I will run and join my friends  Frank  And bid the servant send me up my visitors when they arrive  Lucy  Yes yes  She withdraws  Frank  taking up the speaking trumpet  Here is what has often brought me from the furthest corner of the garden much against my inclination and I think I hear it stillSo ho there Frank FrankMy young friends live only at the corner of the street Let me see if I can hurry them  He puts the trumpet to his mouth throws up the window and cries out  Girls and boys come out to play  The moon doth shine as bright as day  Come with a whoop and come with a call  Come with goodwill or not at all  He leaves the window and draws near the door  Well is not this surprising It is like Harlequin's enchanted here I think I hear them talking to each other on the stairs  He listens  Yes yes I protest the two Danby's  He puts the trumpet by  Suppose I were to jump now on the table and receive them sitting on my throne  He runs to fetch a stool that he may put it on the table and prepares to take a spring but the arrival of the two Danby's prevents him  SCENE II  Frank Elder Danby Younger Danby  Frank  Could not you have staid a little at the door till I was mounted on my throne that I might give you audience as they say in all my glory  Elder Danby  Good indeed you have no occasion for a throne to look exactly like a king And active as you are the throne might possibly cause your majesty a tumble  Frank  Why to say the truth I have read of many tumbles of that nature in my ancient history  Elder Danby  And in some sort such an accident has happened to my brother though he is no great prince He fell down stairs last week and hurt his nose considerably  Younger Danby  stuttering  Yes indeedeed It pains me stistill a little and that maaaster Roberts is a very nauauaughty boy  Frank  Does he design to come tonight  Elder Danby  I hope not if we had expected him here we should not have stirred out  Younger Danby  He ooonly thinks of mismischief  Frank  What has he done then  Elder Danby  We were both going out last Saturday I stopped to get a handkerchief my brother went down stairs alone and as it happened Roberts hearing some one came out slily jumped at once upon my brother who was frighted lost his footing and rolled down the stairs from top to bottom  Frank  Poor Danby I am sorry for you Roberts looks for all the world as if he loved such mischief We shall have his company this evening for the first time in our lives his father begged papa to let him come and see us  Elder Danby  I am sorry for it For we do not speak to one another  Frank  My papa supposed you all good friends because you lodge together and considered that you would have the greater pleasure if he came  Elder Danby  The greater pleasure We should like to have him ten miles off Since he has been our neighbour we are continually uneasy He has frequently amused himself with breaking windows and then tried to lay the blame on us  Frank  Does no one make complaint about him to his father  Elder Danby  Oh I do not know what to make of him he is such an odd sort of a man He scolds a little pays the damage and that is all  Frank  If I were your papa I would quit my lodgings and live somewhere else  Elder Danby  Yes so he means to do and therefore yesterday gave warning and now we are forbidden all manner of connexion with this Roberts he is so wicked Would you think it very few go by the house without being apprehensive that he will put some trick upon them Sometimes he diverts himself by squirting puddle water at them or else pelting them with rotten apples Nay he will sometimes fasten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs at which the people when they see it all burst out a laughing Then too he has what he calls his  caxen fishery  Frank  Caxen fishery  Elder Danby  Yes he will take the people's wigs off as they pass him with a hook as you would carp When any poor man stops before his window to converse with an acquaintance Roberts immediately goes up to the balcony with a string suspended from a fishingrod and at the end of it a hook with which he jerks the poor man's wig off Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpose after which he drives the creature out into the street and off he sets that instant so that the poor perriwig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud before its owner can lay hold of it again  Frank  But this is more than mere amusement  Elder Danby  And yet this is nothing to the stories that I could tell you Why he lames or bruises all the dogs and cats that come within his reach Nor is it long ago when one of his relations broke a leg by slipping down upon the stairs where Roberts had been scattering peas on purpose Ay it is so or else our name is not Danby And for the servants I am sure his father would not get one to attend him if he did not pay extraordinary wages  Frank  Shall I tell you now I long to see him I like boys a little merry  Elder Danby  Nothing is more natural but Roberts's mirth is not like other children's You I know love laughing in your heart but would not for the world hurt any one whereas this wicked fellow laughs at bumps and bruises  Frank  Oh that does not fright me in the least I shall be much more pleased in paying him as he deserves  Elder Danby  If he should come my brother will not offend you by withdrawing He would do him some fresh mischief  Younger Danby  Yeyeyes I will go  Frank  No no we are old friends and positively no new comer shall divide us I will take care and manage him I warrant youBut do not I hear a noise upon the stairsIt is RobertsNo I see my sister and her company  SCENE III  Frank Elder Danby Younger Danby Lucy Isabella Dorinda Alice Laura  Lucy  Your humble servant my good friends but why not seated brother You might easily have got the gentlemen a chair apiece since they have been with you Sure there has been time enough  Frank  As if we did not know that it is usual to stand up when we receive ladies  Lucy  I am charmed to find you know your duty but where is master Roberts  to the Danbys  I did suppose that you would have brought him with you  Elder Danby  It is a long time now thank Heaven since we have been separated from him  Dorinda  Is he then unlu  kier than Lucy's brother  Laura  archly  Certainly he would be unlucky then indeed  Alice  Lucy's brother He is a very lamb to Roberts We have known him for a long time Have we not dear sister  Laura  We have and he has played me many a trick  Alice  He was very intimate with Anthony my brother but he is rid of him entirely now why he is the saddest fellow in the world  Lucy  Oh as for that my brother is even with him there  Dorinda  But to do mischief merely for the pleasure of itthere is the villainy  Lucy  No no my brother is better than that comes to  Frank  with an air of irony  Do you really think so I am obliged to you  Dorinda  Well well my dear Lucy we will be under your protection you are the biggest of us and besides at present you are mistress of the house and may command him  Lucy  Do not you be afraid I will keep him perfectly in bounds  Frank  Yes yes Lucy you shall take care of the ladies and for you  to the Danby's  I will take you under my protection  Elder Danby  Oh he will hardly think of playing tricks with me He knows me I assure you I only fear for my brother  Younger Danby  He makes gagagame of me yes alalalways  Laura  That is his way he always attacks the least He would never vex my sisternone but me  Lucy  I can believe you such as he are always cowards I compare him to a puppy following close upon a cat as long as she keeps running but if once the cat turns round and shews her whiskers then the puppy scampers for it  Frank  Well then sister you shall be the cat  Laura  And let him see your whiskers  Lucy  But methinks it would not be amiss if we sat down Though we expect this Mr Mischiefmaker we have no need I fancy to remain standing up till he chuses to appear  Frank  Hush here he is  SCENE IV  Frank Elder Danby Younger Danby Lucy Isabella Dorinda Alice Laura Roberts  Roberts  to Frank and his sister making them a bow  Your servant Your papa was pleased to let me wait upon you so I am come to spend the evening with you  Lucy  We are glad to see you and shall have a deal of pleasure in your company at least my brother  Isabelia  Yes indeed he wants for good example  Frank  Do I So your good example you would have the gentleman suppose is not sufficient  Lucy  Well a truce to compliments As mistress of the house it is necessary that I should let you know who is who This tall young lady in the first place is Miss Dorinda Lambton  Roberts  with a banter  I am charmed to hear it  Lucy  And these are the Miss  Roberts  O I know them very well This here is  pointing to Alice  my ladywhat is her name Pentweazle that will take you off the company as simple as she seems And there is  pointing to Laura and limping round the room  Miss Upanddown who broke her leg by running from the rod This gentleman  Elder Danby  observe him he is a grave wise Grecian who looks strait before him when he walks as if he pitied us poor silly children And this other good little friend of mine  pointing to younger Danby and letting fall his hat  is Pepepeter Grievous whose dear mama forgot poor creature to untie his tongue when he was born  The children seem surprized and stare at one another  Frank  And who am I sir for methinks you seem quite clever at this sort of portrait painting  Roberts  Oh I am not sufficiently acquainted with you yet to take your likeness but I shall let you have it soon  Lucy  For you sir I could draw you at a glance and I must tell you the similitude would not be very pleasing I could never have supposed it possible that any well bred little gentleman as I imagine you affect to be should think of turning natural defects into a theme for banter If my little friends were not sincerely such they would have reason to reproach me for exposing them to your indecency But they can see that I could not have expected half so much myself  Roberts  Why Frank I protest your sister is mighty eloquent You need not go to church on Sundays having such a charming preacher in the house  Frank  She has tolerable skill when any one is to be told the truth and therefore both my sister Isabella and I love her sincerely  Roberts  Well well you see I have tolerable skill likewise in telling truth and therefore no doubt you will love me too sincerely  He bows to Lucy  I ask your pardon miss for having taken your employment out of your hands as you are yourself so clever at it  Lucy  Your excuses and your bow are both an insult but an insult such as I despise Though were they on the other hand sincere they would hardly make atonement for so coarse an incivility If I had not considered every word that you said as meant in joke however gross I cannot but suppose it I should know what suited me to do and should have done it likewise Let me therefore beg sir that you will indulge in no more freedoms of this nature if you mean that we should remain together  Roberts  somewhat embarrassed  Well but I see you do not understand a little harmless piece of banter Let us be friends  He  out his hand  Lucy  giving hers  With all my heart sir but provided  Roberts  turning his back suddenly upon Lucy and addressing young Danby  You are an honest little fellow too and I will shake hands with you  He hesitates to give his hand and therefore Roberts seizing on it shakes his arm so roughly that he falls a crying  Elder Danby  Master Roberts  Frank  laying hold of Roberts's arm  Pray sir let this child alone or  Roberts  Wellor whatmy little Jackadandy  Frank    laly  I am little I acknowledge but yet strong enough and so you will find me when my friends require to be defended  Roberts  Say you so in that case I should like to be one of them But beforehand if you please we will have a brush just to see how you will be able to defend them  Roberts on a  tries to fling him down but Frank stands his g  nd and Roberts falls The company rush in to part them  Frank  But one moment if you please young ladies I will not do him any harm Well Mr Roberts pray how do you find yourself I fancy I am your master  Roberts  struggling  Take your knee offor you will stifle me  Frank  No no you must not think of getting up unless you first ask pardon  Roberts  furiously  Pardon  Frank  Yes sir and of all the company as you have certainly offended all the company  Roberts  Well well I do ask pardon  Frank  If you should insult us again be assured we will send you down into the cellar till tomorrow morning which will surely cool your courage That is much better than to hurt you We do not think you worth the troubleRise  He gets from off him and when both are up continues  You have no right to be offended for remember it was yourself began the contest  Roberts seems ashamed  Dorinda  aside to Isabella  I could never have supposed your brother half so valiant  Isabella  Oh a lion is hardly bolder and yet Dorinda he never quarrels He is in short although I say it the best tempered little fellow in the world  To the company  But what are we doing We ought to think of some amusement for the evening  Frank  Certainly we ought or why are we all come together Well what play shall we chuse Something funny what say you Danby  Elder Danby  We will let the ladies chuse  Roberts makes mouths at Frank and Danby the rest pretend as if they did not see him  Lucy  There Frank there is a lesson for you we may chuse Well then suppose we play at questions and commands or possibly you would like a game at cards much better  Laura  I should rather play at something with the least Danby If you have a picturebook we will turn it over shall we  Younger Danby  O oooh yes yes  Lucy  With all my heart sweet dears I will carry you up stairs You will neither want for pictures nor playthings there  Laura and the younger Danby take hold of one another by the hand and jump for joy  Lucy  to the ladies  My friends will you go with me for amusement into my apartment I have a charming bonnet that you will like to see  All  together  Yes yes yes let us go  Elder Danby  Will you accept my hand as far as your apartment Miss Lucy  Lucy  Rather let Miss Dorinda or Alice have it if they please  The elder Danby presents his hand to Alice who happens to stand next him  Roberts  What then do you mean to leave me by myself here  Frank  No sir these young ladies will excuse me so I shall stay but I am obliged to leave you for a moment  Roberts  Are you but I will follow you I do not like to be left alone by night and in a house where I am a stranger  ACT II  SCENE I  Frank Roberts  Roberts  The truth is I was apprehensive lest you might think of playing me some trick so I accompanied you But now that we are returned and all alone we may devise some mirth between us  Frank  Very willingly I ask no better so let us think a little  Roberts  We must have some fun I fancy with the younger Danby  Frank  If by fun you mean some trick to hurt him I say no I will not be in a joking humour so pray leave him out if you are bent on mischief  Roberts  They told me that you were always merry and fond of something funny  Frank  And so I am but notwithstanding without hurt to any one However let me know what sort of fun you meant  Roberts  Look you here are two large needles I will stick them both with the points upward in the bottom of two chairs that common eyes shall not discern them In the next place you shall offer two of these young ladies the two chairs for very likely they would suspect that I meant them mischief of some sort or other and they will naturally both sit down but figure to yourself what strange grimaces they will both make Ha ha ha ha It makes me die a laughing when I barely think what faces we shall see them put on Ay ay and your prudish sister too will find the matter quite diverting  Frank  But suppose I were to treat you just in the same manner would you like it  Roberts  Oh treat me that is different but those little idiots  Frank  So you call them idiots do you since they are not mischievous  Roberts  Well you are mighty formal and precise Then shall I mention something else  Frank  Yes do  Roberts  Then I have some thread as strong as whipcord in my pocket I will thread one of these great needles with a little of it and as soon as they are all come down one of us shall go up politely towards them make a deal of scraping and wry faces while the other keeping still behind shall sew their gowns together They will all want to dance as you may guess so up we will come and take them outHa ha you know the rest ha ha ha ha ha  Frank  Yes to tear their gowns and get them anger when their parents find it out  Roberts  Why there is the fun  Frank  What have you no pleasure then in any thing but doing mischief  Roberts  But it does not hurt me  Frank  O ho I understand you think of no one but yourself and all the world is nothing to you  Roberts  Well but we are come together to divert ourselves and we must positively have some laughing So suppose we frighten Laura and the least Danby  Frank  But that is quite wrong Supposing any one should frighten you  Roberts  With all my heart if any one is but able I am afraid of nothing  Frank  aside  Say you soThat we shall see perhaps  Aloud to Roberts  Well about this frightening  Roberts  I have an ugly mask at home I will run and fetch it And do you when I am gone contrive to bring the little children down and you shall seeI will not be absent half a minute  Frank  aside  GoodThere shall be a better mask ready for you though  To Roberts calling him back  But Roberts Roberts  Roberts  What is the matter  Frank  It will be better that we should come upon them where we are if I can bring the others down for when there are but two or three in this part of the house there sometimes comes a spirit and in that case we ourselves should be but badly off  Roberts  What is all this story of a spirit  Frank  Nay it is true At first one hears a noise and then a phantom with a lighted torch glides by and then the room seems all on fire  He draws back as if afraid  Oh methinks I see it now  Roberts  a little frightened  See whatO dear And what can bring the phantom here  Frank  drawing Roberts towards a corner and then whispering to him  The reason as we are told is this There was a miser who lived here formerly and he was robbed one night of all his money In despair he cut his throat and now from time to time his ghost goes up and down  Roberts  in a tremble  O ho I will stay no longer here unless you get more company  Frank  But recollect how brave you were just now  Roberts  You must not fancy I am afraidbutbut butbutbut I will go and fetch my mask  Frank  Do do and I will prepare things hereWhat pleasure we shall have  Roberts  with a grin  Oh enough to make one die with laughing  Frank  They will be finely frightened  Roberts  That they will and therefore I will make haste I am at home and back againyou shall see how soon  He goes out  Frank  alone  Ah ah you want to frighten others and are not afraid yourself Well well I have thought of something that will frighten you or I am very much mistaken  SCENE II  Frank Lucy Isabella Dorinda Alice elder Danby  Lucy  We saw Master Roberts run across the street this moment What is the matter Have you had a quarrel  Frank  On the contrary he thinks me his best friend I have seemed willing to go shares with him in a trick that he means to put upon the little ones above but it is himself that he will trick and never wish to come here a third time  Lucy  Well what is your project  Frank  You shall know very soon At present I have no time to lose for every thing must be in readiness against his coming back so ladies I request permission to be absent for about five minutes  Dorinda  Yes go go but do not stay longer We are all impatient to be told what you design  Frank  I shall consider it my duty to inform you when I have finished my preparations So once more with your leave I will come again in less perhaps than five minutes  He goes out  Lucy  Ah ah ahTwo pretty fellows together We shall see what good comes out between them They are well matched  Elder Danby  Oh for Heaven's sake Miss Lucy do not do such dishonour to my friend your brother as to name him and that wicked Roberts together  Alice  You are in the right Dauby One is nothing but politeness and the other quite a savage  Isabella  Savage as he is however I would lay a wager that Frank will be found his master  Dorinda  What a piece of service Frank would do us could he clear the house of such a fellow We shall have no pleasure all the evening if he stays among us  Lucy  I am afraid however Frank will proceed too far and think himself permitted to do any thing against this Roberts  Elder Danby  He can never do enough and though his scheme should be a little hard on Roberts there will be instruction in it it is the greatest service that one can do him and his father I am persuaded will be pleased with Frank when he hears what pains he has taken to instruct his son Alas he would part with half his fortune to have Roberts like him  Alice  So Lucy do not you go about to thwart your brother's good intentions  Lucy  But my dear Miss Alice I am in a ticklish situation I am now instead of my mama and cannot possibly  let any thing go forward that she would not approve  Alice  Let him have his way We will take the blame of what he does upon ourselves  Isabella  Yes let him sister War I say war war for ever with the wicked  Frank  returning joyfully  I have settled every thing and Roberts may appear whenever he thinks proper We will receive him  Lucy  But I hope you will tell me  Dorinda  Yes we will be in the plot too and more than that assist you if we can  Frank  No ladies that is not necessary There is a little violence I must acknowledge in my plot and therefore I will not make you parties I have been settling every thing with Ralph in the stable He conceives my meaning clearly and will second it with great dexterity  Lucy  But still you do not acquaint me  Frank  This is all of the contrivance that you need know We will go to Blindman's Buff that Roberts may suspect no harm on his return I will let myself be caught and he or she that blinds me must take care that I may have an opportunity of seeing through the handkerchief and fixing upon Roberts After he is blinded you shall steal into the closet take away the lights and leave us both together When I want your aid I will call you  Elder Danby  But if Roberts should proceed to thrash you in your tÃªte Ã  tÃªte  Frank  Proceed to thrash me You observed how easily I flung him down I am not afraid of such a one as he for I have found him to be nothing but a coward so that is fixed But first we must have both the little ones down stairs or Roberts might go up and frighten them while we are talking here together So pray sister  to Isabella  go and bring them down  Isabella  Yes yes  She goes out  Lucy  But brother I am not clear that I should permit you  Alice  What is the matter Let him do I tell you as he pleases  Frank  Yes yes sister and rely on my discretion You are sensible I do not like mischief for the sake of mischief therefore he shall not have half the punishment that he merits but come off when I have frightened him a little and that is all the harm that I mean to do him  Lucy  Well then Frank on your promise of discretion  Frank  Yes I promise you no less So let us make haste and put the things to rights that all may be in order here too when he comes  They put away the chairs and table Isabella in the mean time comes down with Laura and younger Danby  Frank  going up to Laura and younger Danby  Come come my little friends into this closet but take care and do not make any noise or Roberts very possibly will hear you  Isabella  I will conduct them There is a book of pictures in it and I will stay to shew them whatever they like  Laura  I thought the tea was ready May we not stay here with you till it comes in  Frank  I shall fetch you when the servant brings it but at present you must go into the closet Roberts wants to frighten you and I will not let him  Younger Danby  Yeyeyes let us go my dededear  Isabella takes up a candle and goes in with Laura and younger Danby  Frank  We comprehend I suppose what we are to do My eyes not wholly covered and whenever I may give the signal you must take away the light and get into the closet but particularly a perfect silence  Dorinda  Yes we understand you  Frank  I believe I hear a noise hush hush hush  he listens at the door  Yes yes it is he it is he be quick let one of you be blinded  Dorinda  I will begin Who takes my handkerchief  Alice blinds Dorinda and they begin to run about  SCENE III  Frank Lucy Dorinda Alice Roberts  Roberts as he enters pinches Dorinda on which she throws her hands out and lays hold of him  Dorinda  It is master Roberts I well know him by his pinching me  Frank  It is master Roberts but he was not in the play You must begin again  Roberts  Undoubtedly Frank is right  Dorinda  Well be it so but if I catch you again it shall be all fair Remember I have warned you  Roberts  O yes yes  He takes Frank aside and lets him see a little of the mask  What think you of it  Frank  feigning to be frightened  O how frightful I should certainly be terrified at seeing it myself Well hide it carefully we will play a little and then slip away  Roberts  whispering Frank  Yes yes we will but I must first of all do something to teize the ladies  Frank  whispering Roberts  I will go up to Dorinda and turn her round if she should catch me she will suppose it to be you and must set out again  Roberts  whispering Frank  Good good I will have a little sun with her too  Alice  Well when will you have told each other all your secrets Two fine gentlemen why do not you see the game stands still  Roberts  You need not stay for us we are ready  Frank  keeping near Miss Dorinda as if be wished to pull her by the gown and seeing Roberts go to fetch a chair  Aside  Now Miss Dorinda I will put myself into your way  Roberts brings a chair and puts it so that Dorinda may tumble over it but Frank takes the chair away and puts himself instead upon his hands and feet with so much noise that Dorinda may hear him As she slides along her feet as if at bazard she encounters Frank stoops and seizes him  Dorinda  after having felt about his cape and wrists and seeming doubtful  It is Master Frank  Frank  in appearance disconcerted  Yes indeed I am taken What ill luck so soon  Dorinda  pulling off the bandage  O ho you wanted to throw me down I thought nobody but master Roberts played such tricks but it shall not be long before I take revenge She covers Frank's eyes but so that he can see a little leads him towards the middle of the room and then as is the custom of the game asks him  How many horses in your father's stable  Frank  Three black white and grey  Dorinda  Turn about three times and catch whom you may  Frank gropes his way from place to place and lets himself be jostled as they please Miss Dorinda particularly plagues him he pretends to follow her but all at once turns round and falls on Roberts  Frank  Ah ha I have caught you have I It is a boy It is Roberts  pulling off the handkerchief  Yes yes I am not mistaken  Roberts  whispering Frank  Why lay hold on  me  Frank  whispering Roberts  Do not mind it You shall catch Danby I will push him towards you  Roberts  whispering Frank  Do and you shall see how I will make him squeak I will pinch him till the very blood comes  Frank begins to cover Roberts's eyes and gives his company a nod as he had settled it Elder Danby assisted by the little ladies takes away the lights and all together run into an adjoining closet without making any noise  Elder Danby  just before he steps into the closet  Well have you finished Oh make haste You take a deal of time What mischief are you whispering to each other  At this instant the groom presents himself at the door he has a lighted torch in one hand and a stick beneath it in the other with a large fullbottomed wig upon it He is covered head and all with Mr Jephson's gown which trails along upon the ground behind him Frank beckons him to stay a little at the entrance while he is b  ding Roberts  Frank  putting Roberts in the middle of the room  How many horses in your father's stable  Roberts  Three black white and grey  Frank  Turn about  pretending to be angry with the others  Be quiet pray young ladies and not quit your places till the game is begunTurn about three times and catch whom you may  The ghost the ghost Run Roberts for your life  He claps the door to violently hides himself behind the Grown and speaking through the trumpet says  It is you then that come to steal my treasure  Roberts  trembling with fear and not daring to pull off the bandage  Fie fire Danby where are you Frank murder murder Dorinda  Frank  speaking through the trumpet  I have scared them all awayPull off your bandage and look at me  Roberts without pulling off the bandage puts both hands before his face retiring as the ghost advances on him  Frank  Pull it off I say  Roberts makes shift to pull the bandage down which falis about his neck He dares not lift his eyes up but at last when he chserves the ghost be screams out and has not power to move  Frank  I know you well your name is Roberts  Roberts hearing this runs up and down to get away he finds the door shut fast falls down upon his knees holds out his hands and turns away his head  Frank  What you think to escape me do you  Roberts  after several efforts  I have done nothing to you You were never robbed by me  Frank  Never robbed by you You are capable of any villainy Who squirts at people in the street Who fastens rabbits' tails behind their backs Who fishes for their wigs Who lames poor dogs and cats Who sticks up pins in chairs to prick his friends when they sit down And who has in his pocket even now a mask to frighten two poor little children  Roberts  I have done all this indeed I own it but for heaven's sake pardon me and I will not do so any more  Frank  Who will answer for you  Roberts  Those that you have frightened away if you will but call them  Frank  Do you promise me yourself  Roberts  Yes yes upon my honour  Frank  Well then I take pity on you but remember had it been my pleasure I might easily fly away with you through the window  Here the phantom shakes his torch which gives a glare like lightning and then goes out Roberts almost swooning with terror falls down on his face  SCENE the last  Roberts Frank the Groom Mr Jephson  Mr Jephson  entering with a candle in his hand  What is all this disturbance  Roberts  without looking up  It is not I that make it Pray pray do not come near me  Mr Jephson  perceiving Roberts on the ground  Who can this be on the ground  Roberts  You know me well enough and have already taken pity on me  Mr Jephson  I already taken pity on you  Roberts  It was not I that robbed you  Mr Jephson  Robbed me what does all this mean do not I know you master Roberts  Roberts  Yes yes that is my name good ghost so pray do not hurt me  Mr Jephson  I am astonished why in such a posture  He puts down the light holds out his hand and lifts him up  Roberts  struggling first of all but knowing Mr Jephson afterwards  Mr Jephson is it you  his features brighten  He is gone then is he  he looks round about him sees the ghost and turns away again  There there he stands the phantomdon't you see him  Frank brings the children from the closet Laura and younger Danby are frightened at the groom's appearance but the rest burst out a laughing  Mr Jephson  Well what signifies all this  Frank  coming forward  Let me explain the whole papa This phantom is your groom and we have put on him your wig and gown  The Groom  letting fall his disguise  Yes sir it is I  Mr Jephson  An odd sort of sport this Frank  Frank  True but ask the company if master Roberts has not well deserved to be thus frightened He designed to frighten Laura and Danby I only wished to hinder him Let him but shew the frightful mask that he has about him  Mr Jephson  to Roberts  Is this true  Roberts  giving him the mask  I cannot deny it here it is sir  Mr Jephson  You have met with nothing then but what you deserve  Dorinda  We persuaded Miss Lucy to permit her brother to make use of this device in order to punish Roberts  Alice  If you knew besides sir all the other tricks that he meant to play us  Mr Jephson  What sir is this the sample that you give us of your behaviour the first time you set foot withinmy doors You have been disrespectful to me in the person of my children who were pleased with the expectation of having you as their guest You have been disrespectful to these ladies whom I need not say you should have honoured and regarded So be gone Your father when he comes to know that you have been thus turned out of doors will see how necessary it is to correct the vices of your heart I will not permit your detestable example to corrupt my children Go and never let me see you here again  Roberts is confounded and withdraws  And you my friends although the circumstances of the case may very possibly excuse what you have done yet never for the time to come indulge yourselves in such a sport The fears which have power to affect children at a tender age may possibly be followed by the worst consequences during their whole life Avenge yourselves upon the wicked only by behaving better and remember after the example which master Roberts has afforded you that by intending harm to others you will oftenest bring it down upon yourselves  THE END OF VOL II  The following BOOKS for the Instruction and Entertainment of Youth
