 AN ODE TO THE GENIUS OF SCANDAL  PRICE ONE SHILLING  AN ODE TO THE GENIUS OF SCANDAL  QUI CAPIT FACIT  I SAY NOTHING  LONDON PRINTED FOR G KEARSLY AT NO IN FLEETSTREET MDCCLXXXI  THE Author of the following ODE intending it solely for the amusement of his intimate acquaintance printed only the requisite number of copies One who has long been happy in his friendship and who was favoured with the poem thought a more enlarged publication might prove beneficial to mankind in correcting an evil of which every one complains With this view he offers it to the world and he hopes the intention will justify the act  If those who with a taste for satire possess the powers of ridicule are by the perusal awakened to a sense of the unhappiness the indiscriminate exercise of that dangerous talent may possibly occasion to innocence and worth and if the tranquility of an individual is preserved the writer's wishes will be gratified  To the Author no suitable excuse can be offeredbut the motive This if his delicacy rejects his heart must approve To the Public no apology will be thought necessary the spirit and elegance of the composition the philanthropy it breathes must recommend it to encomium and secure to it the applause it so justly merits  Cambridge  Oct    AN  ODE  OH thou whose allconsoling pow'r  Can soothe our cares to rest  Whose touch in Spleen's most vap'rish hour  Can calm each female breast  Thee I invoke Great Genius hear  Pity a lady's sighs  Without thy kind relief be near  Poor COQUETINA dies  Haste thee then and with thee bring  Many a little venom'd sting  Many a tale that no one knows  Of shallbenameless belles and beaux  Justimported curtain lectures  Winks and nods and shrewd conjectures  Half a dozen strange suspicions  Built on stranger suppositions  Unknown marriages some twenty  Private childbed linen plenty  And horns just fitted to some people's heads  And certain powder'd coats and certain tumbled beds  Teach me powerful Genius teach  Thine own mysterious art  Safe from Retaliation's reach  How I may throw detraction's dart  So shall my hand an altar raise  Sacred to thy transcendent praise  And daily with assiduous care  Some grateful sacrifice prepare  The first informations  Of lost reputations  As offerings to thee I'll consign  And the earliest news  Of surpriz'd billetdoux  Shall constant be serv'd at thy shrine  Intrigues by the score  Never heard of before  Shall the sacrifice daily augment  And by each Morning Post  Some favourite Toast  A victim to thee shall be sent  Heav'ns methinks I see thy train  Softly tripping o'er the plain  All the alphabet I view  Stepping forward two and two  Hush for as they coupled walk  Sure I hear the letters talk  Though lowlyfearful whisperings half smother  The well concerted tales they blab of one another  "Lord who'd have thought our cousin  D  "Could think of marrying Mrs  E  "True I don't like these things to tell  "But faith I pity Mr  L  "And was I he the bride to vex  "I'd go and court my Lady  X  "Indeed they say that Charlotte  U  "With Fanny  M  and we guess who  "Occasion'd allfor you must know  "They set their caps at Mr  O  "And as he courted Mrs  E  "They thought if she'd have cousin  D  "That things might be through Captain  A  "Just brought about in their own way"  Oh how the pleasing style regales my ear  Heav'ns what new forms are these which now appear  See yonder in the thickest throng  Designing Envy sculks along  Big with malicious Laughter  Fiction and Cunning swell her train  While stretching far behind in vain  Poor Truth comes panting after  Now now indeed I burn with sacred fires  'Tis SCANDAL's self that ev'ry thought inspires  I feel allpotent Genius now I feel  Thy working magic through each art'ry steal  At thy command my fancy warms  And sweetly paints the alter'd scene  Her touch now ev'ry grace deforms  And blackens ev'ry mien  Each moment to my prying eyes  Some fresh disfigur'd beauties rise  Each minute I perceive some flaw  That e'en Illnature's self ne'er saw  Hark some airy whisp'rer hints  In accents wisely faint  That bright Cleora rather squints  Rosetta uses paint  That though some fops of Celia prate  Yet be not her's the praise  For if she should be passing straight  Hemshe may thank her stays  Each fool of Delia's figure talks  And celebrates her fame  But for my part whene'er she walks  I think she's rather lame  And mind Ma'am Chloe toss her head  Lord how the creature stares  WellI thank God it can't be said  I  give myself those airs  But soft what figure's this I now see come  His awful frown strikes even SCANDAL dumb  Ah me the blood forsakes my trembling cheek  While sternly thus methinks I hear him speak  Peace snarling woman peace  'Tis CANDOUR bids thee cease  CANDOURat whose insulted name  Even  thy  face should burn with shame  Too long I've silent seen  The venom of thy spleen  Too long with secret pain  Observ'd black SCANDAL's reign  But now with indignation stung  Justice demands my tongue  And bids me drag the lurking fiend to light  And hold her deeds of darkness up to sight  Look on this prospect and if e'er thy brow  Can feel Compunction's sick'ning blush 'tis now  Mark yonder weeping maid  Sadly deserted laid  Beside that mournful willow  There ev'ry day in silent woe  She bids her tears incessant flow  And ev'ry night forlornly pining  Mute on her lilly hand reclining  Bedews her waking pillow  Sweet girl she was once most enchantingly gay  Each youth felt her charms and acknowledg'd their sway  No arts did she use to acquire a grace  'Twas good humour alone that enliven'd her face  Pure nature had leave in her actions to speak  The wildness of youth gave the blush to her cheek  And her looks uninstructed her thoughts would impart  Since her eyes only flash'd from the warmth of her heart  Herself undesigning no schemes she suspected  Ne'er dreaming of ambush defence she neglected  With the youth that she lov'd at the moon's silver hour  In confidence tender she stole to the bow'r  There he hop'd to have all his desires obtain'd  But she spurn'd at the insult her virtue sustain'd  And he in revenge for his baffled endeavour  Gave a hint'twas enoughshe was ruin'd for ever  A thousand kind females the story augmented  Each day grinning Envy additions invented  Till satiated Malice had gain'd all her ends  Had robb'd her of characterhappinessfriends  And now sad innocentalone  Shunn'd as a pest she makes her moan  And in unheard despair  Yields all resign'd to soulconsuming care  Yet many a time her wand'ring brain  Turns with its fev'rish weight of pain  And then a thousand childish things  The pretty mad one rudely sings  Or mute on the ground she gazes  And weeps as she scatters her daisies  And then in a strain more distractedly loud  She chants the sad thoughts of her fancy  And shivers and sings of her cold shrowd  Ah poor Nancy  Nay weep not now'tis now too late  Thy friendship might have stopt her fate  Rather now hide thy head in conscious shame  Thy mouth too buzz'd the tale that stain'd her fame  But comeagainturn here thine eyes  And view another victim rise  Observe that crested warriorhis name  Could make whole hostile ranks disordered fly  Victory follow'd where the hero came  And conquest darted from his vengeful eye  His was true courage on good prudence built  An arm prepar'd to extirpate or save  'Twas only rais'd to crush presuming guilt  Or lend its vigour to the honest brave  Yet e'en a man thus form'd  With ev'ery nobler passion warm'd  At Envy's infamous command  Fell by dark SCANDAL's secret hand  Lothario dearest of his friends  Wrong'd himhe scorn'd to ask amends  In real valour calmness we admire  'Tis your mock honour that's so soon on fire  Souls truly great no rash resentments seek  His friendship pardon'd e'er his rage could speak  Yet for a deed that challeng'd brightest fame  SCANDAL bedamn'd him with a coward's name  Nay more secure her vengeance to pursue  Proclaim'd the man that own'd him coward too  And see with proudly sullen air  The injur'd hero stalks alone  And though his looks betray his care  Disdains to vent a single groan  Save when by some distracting thought  To wild impatience madly wrought  With sudden stamp the ground he beats  As Mem'ry paints his former feats  How once kneedeep in blood  Immoveably he stood  And in the howling battle's roar  With gaping wounds all cover'd o'er  His single arm durst firm oppose  A phalanx of assailing foes  And mark with starting rage possess'd  Wildly he bares his furrow'd breast  And as his scars he views with aching eyes  "Oh 'tis too much" the fault'ring vet'ran cries  Yet scorning still to let his pangs appear  Bites hard his quiv'ring lip and gulps the starting tear  These are the triumphs SCANDAL claims  Triumphs deriv'd from ruin'd names  Such as to generous minds unknown  An honest soul would scorn to own  Nor think vain woman while you sneer  At others faults that you are clear  Noturn your backyou undergo  The selfsame malice you to others show  And soon by some malicious tale o'erthrown  Like these shall fall unpitied and unknown  Oh then ye blooming fair attend  Oh take kind CANDOUR for your friend  Nor forfeit for a mean delight  That pow'r o'er man that's yours by right  To woman ev'ry charm was giv'n  Design'd by all indulgent Heav'n  To soften every care  Yes ye were form'd to bless mankind  To harmonize and soothe the mind  And guard us from despair  But when from those sweet lips we hear  Illnature's whisper Envy's sneer  Your pow'r that moment dies  Each coxcomb makes your name his sport  And fools when angry will retort  What men of sense despise  Leave then such low pursuits as these  And take a nobler road to please  Let CANDOUR guide your way  So shall you daily conquests gain  And captives glorying in your chain  Be proud to own your sway  THE END
