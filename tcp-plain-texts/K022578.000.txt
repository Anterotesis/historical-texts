 A COLLECTION OF POEMS and TRANSLATIONS In ENGLISH and LATIN  By  THOMAS HULL  Agedum pauca accipe  Primùm ego me illorum dederim quibus esse Poëtis  Excerpam numero neque enim concludere versum  Dixeris esse satis neque si quis seribat uti nos  Sermoni propiora putes hunc esse Poëtam  HOR Sat iv Lib L  For my own Part  I claim no Portion of the Poet's Art  'Tis not enough to close the flowing Line  And in ten Syllables your Sense confine  Or write in meer prosaic Rhimes like me  That can deserve the Name of Poetry  FRANCIS's Transl  BATH  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY HIM AT TUCKER'S CHINA SHOP IN THE CHURCHYARD AND MR LEAKE AND MR FREDERICK BOOKSELLERS STEPHEN MARTIN PRINTER AND MR PALMER AND MR WARD BOOKSELLERS IN BRISTOL  To the RIGHT HONORABLE LORD  BOYD  MY LORD  IT has been ever advanced by all who have understood the World that a great Man never distinguishes himself so much as in his Behavior and Countenance shewn to Inferiors if so Your LORDSHIP is certainly the most conspicuous Instance of the Truth of this Maxim in thinking  me  worthy YOUR least Notice  THE very grateful Sense I have of the Honor done me herein I can never be able to express Yet my utmost Pride shall not influence me to run into the general Stile of Dedicators in attemping an Encomium on YOUR LORDSHIP's Virtues YOUR public  Goodness cannot but be  injured  by such a Pen as mine and YOUR  private  is surely sufficiently manifested in condescending to smile on a young Writer unknown to Merit as to Fame  THE Publication of my Productions can I am very certain boast no Value but what arises from YOUR LORDSHIP's having set YOUR Stamp on them Yet whatever Reception they meet from the Public the utmost Poignancy of Censure I should always think amply overballanced by the Pride and Pleasure of YOUR Permission to subscribe myself with the utmost Respect  MY LORD  Your  LORDSHIP's  Most obliged and obedient Servant  Thomas Hull  THERE are two Kinds of Poetry to which no  PREFACE  is necessary viz  extreme good  and  extreme bad  The first requires none and the last deserves none For the latter Reason I must entreat my very patient Readers to take Notice that this is an  APOLOGY  which I think indispensibly necessary to obviate two Objections  IN the first Place to those who may ask  why I wrote  and to be sure the Question is highly rational and palpable I answer to employ my leisure Hours in an Exercise which gives me Pleasure and does no one else any InjuryAnd I might no doubt have found many Methods of Pastime that would not have amounted to so good a Purpose as that of  doing no Harm  IN the second Place to those who may ask  why I published  and by the Bye this is a Question more rational and palpable than the former I answer that I had no other Means of convincing the World I ever employed my Time to any Purpose at all  I am very sensible there may and certainly will be several Witticisms smart Strokes of Raillery and Satirical Similies  on a raw unfledg'd Poet which indeed I could here insert but that I would by no Means be so illmanner'd to my Readers as to take the Words out of their Mouths or prevent their having their Laugh out  HOWEVER to be serious I cannot in Gratitude conclude this Address to the Public without returning my best Thanks to my several Friends who have so kindly contributed to the Publication of the ensuing trifling Performance I have only to desire they will take Notice that the  Paraphrase on the Tenth Ode of Horace the Card to Venus and Ode to Cupid  are the Product of much better Pens than mine My Reason for mentioning this is only to return their Authors Thanks for the Honor they have done me and not to point out a Distinction which must be so very obvious to every Capacity  LIST OF THE SUBSCRIBERS  A

Grief could feel while she were nigh  And Laughter wanton'd in her Eye  Nor Pleasure know estrang'd to Joys  Whene'er I hear  Amasia  's Sighs  Nor any any Danger fear  So greatas that of losing her  YET it must beI'm doom'd to part  To tear her from my Eyes my Heart  My ev'ry Hope each Wish resign  And never never call her mine  But is there none no secret Way  My Vows to waft my Duty pay  Friendship Esteem Can none of these  Instruct an artless Swain to please  Yet robb'd of the sole Pow'r t'impart  The honest Meaning of my Heart  How can I half its Feelings prove  How When I dare not

the Pride of Love  To view to hear to clasp her once again  Were cheaply purchas'd with an Age of Pain  SONG  LONG at thy Altar God of Love  I paid a double Duty  A Slave to  Celia  's Voice and Wit  To  Chloe  's Taste and Beauty  Fain would I fix my restless Heart  While they with awkward Feature  Disguise in Affectation's Masque  The bounteous Gifts of Nature  Celia  affecting Beauty's Grace  Destroys her Sense and Spirit  And  Chloe  's Charms thro' fancy'd Wit  Lose all their wonted Merit  While in their native Beauties deckt  I can love bothor either  But thus in borrow'd Airs disguis'd  I can be fond of neither  Imitation of Part of the d Epode of  Horace  Horrida Tempestas Coelum contraxit  c  NOW wintry Blasts deform the Yearthe Rain  Descendsfast falls the fleeting Snow  Bleak thro' the Woods the NorthWinds blow  And Storms and Tempests vex the angry Main  From these let us a Warning take  And learn of Life the most to make  While  Youth Health Strength  and  Jollity

confin'd  Still some Emotions flutter'd in her Mind  The wily Youth had touch'd her tender Breast  When smiling soft the Swain she thus addrest  Cease fond Youth no Pray'r shall move  My soften'd Soul to guilty Love  Those passionate Complaints give o'er  Complyor ne'er behold me more  My Rage yet Pity disapproves  Some Pow'r o'ersways but 'tis not Love's  Be Passion lost in Friendship's Flame  Approach me with that sacred Name  And ev'ry virtuous Blessing claim  Such kind Expressions such endearing Terms  Who dares misconstrue what dire Lust alarms  The am'rous Youth her Fondness misapply'd  Inflam'd with fierce Desire And warmly sigh'd  Friendship  alas in Breasts like mine  Dominion ne'er can own  Where  rebel Love  holds uncontroul'd  A firm unshaken Throne  Come let me fold thee in my Arms  Secure from ev'ry Eye  Pour forth my Soul in Rapture's Heat  And on thy Bosom die  THE virtuous Nymph in conscious Grief and Fear  Mourn'd silently yet dropt a speaking Tear  Struck with Remorse he saw the piercing Sign  Of Heav'nborn Innocence and Truth divine  Sorrow and Shame his erring Bosom stung  And halfbroke Accents faulter'd on his Tongue  She saw with Pleasure his repentant Grief  And thus bespoke to give his Soul Relief  How blest I am no Tongue can prove  In such superior Force to move  And heal thy frantic Breast  Such Virtue Tenderness and Truth  What Pow'r could harm return'd the Youth  He look'd and sigh'd the rest  Remorse and Wonder held them silent long  Then Joy burst forth spontaneous in their Song  Matchless the Youth who timely wise  Can Passion's Faults retrieve  Matchless the Fair who kindly tries  Those Errors to forgive  Hence shall each meaner Bosom learn  How  Virtue  's Pow'r can move  How infelt  Goodness  awes the Soul  And  Friendship  conquers Love  SONG of VERTUMNUS imitated  What beauteous Scenes inchant my Sight  c  PULCHRA quae coram video venusta  Brachia expandens generosa vitis  Ecce quam forti placidoque nexu  Jungitur

PARAPHRASE on PSALM  I  BE Thou O LORD my Refuge in Distress  My Stay in Trouble and Support in Pain  So shall Adversity's Assaults be less  And hostile Arrows spend their Force in vain  II  What tho' the Earth from her Foundations rise  The Hills upturn'd be cast into the Sea  And Mountains shake to hear the Tempest's Voice  Unmov'd I standmy Trust I place in Thee  III  Tho' Ocean rage and foaming Billows roar  Secure O Lord thy great Tribunal's plac'd  For at thy Nod the Billows swell no more  The Earth is firm the Mountains are at rest  IV  Terror avauntDanger is far from hence  A guiltless Conscience forms it's own Reward  The mighty Lord of Hosts is my Defence  The God of  Jacob  my Retreat and Guard  V  Come and behold the Wonders of his Hand  Lo now Destruction reigns and Battle's Ire  Now the War's hushtSpears break at his Command  And Chariots crackle in consuming Fire  VI  Then free my Soul from Terror and Suspence  Await with Patience the divine Award  The mighty Lord of Hosts is thy Defence  The God of  Jacob  thy Retreat and Guard  PASTORAL  I  WHILE the clear Brook in prattling Murmurs play'd  And Solitude adorn'd the pleasing Shade  Blythe  Corydon  breath'd forth his glowing Joy  Ye Swains attendthus sung the am'rous Boy  II  No more to  Fancy  's Dreams the Notes belong  Nor weak Ideas feebly tune my Tongue  No more Invention's Aid the Muse requires  Or faint Conception's momentary Fires  III  'Tis Gratitude inspires my ravish'd Heart  And Virtue's Charms true Sentiments impart  To my  Amasia  's Ear the Notes belong  Sweet are the Strains if she approve my Song  IV  How blest am I to see the Nymph I love  List to my Converse and my Flame approve  Who scorns the Trifler's Praise the Flatt'rer's Art  Humbly content to take an honest Heart  V  The painted Rose that blooms on Beauty's Face  The damask Lip and every specious Grace  What solid Joys alas can these impart  If unattended with a spotless Heart  VI  Wherefore did Heav'n the female Race supply  With each gay Lustre that attracts the Eye  Unless the fair Appearance was design'd  The Habitation of a fairer Mind  VII  Is there who doubts the Truth of what I say  Who thinks all female Charms will soon decay  In sweet  Amasia  's Aspect let him see  What Beauty is and Virtue ought to be  VIII  Behold the blooming Cheek O Joy to look  Has not the Rose her native Bed forsook  Then read her Mindexamine it with Care  Say is not ev'ry shining Virtue there  IX  Such are the Charms that in her Bosom shine  Where Chastity and Truth and Candour join  Charms that ne'er fadebut hourly

rashly tempt the angry Main  Nor when embark'd each rising Gale can move  Thy purpos'd Soul to make the Port again  II  Whoe'er the golden Medium wisely keeps  And timely flies Ambition's giddy State  Exempt from sordid Want securely sleeps  Exempt from envy'd Trappings of the Great  III  The Cloudcapt Tow'rs a wider Ruin spread  The Pine full oft the Tempest's Rage endures  And dreadful Lightnings blast the Hill's high Head  From which Humility the Vale secures  IV  When fickle Fortune smiles the steady Mind  Still fears each Hour an adverse Stroke may bring  Hopes when she frowns some happier Lot behind  The Pow'r who sends the Winter sends the Spring  V  Tho' ruthless Fate reject our present Pray'rs  It's stern Decrees in Time may milder grow  Phoebus  oft joins the Muses' sprightly Airs  Nor always bends his pestilential Bow  VI  Boldly do thou my Friend with Heart prepar'd  Stem the strong Current of Adversity  But when Prosperity's full Gales blow hard  Reef Reef betimesnor trust the Fallacy  A CARD to VENUS  In imitation of the Thirtieth ODE of the first Book of HORACE  O Venus Regina Cnidi  c  COME Venus come and make us blest  Mine and my  Chloe  's welcome Guest  What tho'

II  Bright Pow'r from thee and only thee  I'll deign to take my Doom  Thy Wisdom must with Beauty join  Ere I can be o'ercome  III  Beauty alone is but a Glass  Wherein an Image shines  Which pleases only when we're near  But when we're gone declines  IV  Give me the Nymph whose Mind is bright  And perfect as her Face  Where Sense improves what Beauty gave  And heightens ev'ry Grace  V  Such only

O could my Pray'rs inspire her Heart  To feel the Rapture she bestows  Yet how can I my Pains impart  When Honor Virtue are my Foes  Yesso extravagant my Flame  All Obstacles it can remove  Honor and Virtue cease your Claim  What what are ye alas to Love  In vain do  Sophists  preach that Heav'n  Has Charms conceal'd from mortal View  They know not what a Pledge was giv'n  They ne'er  Amasia

Agonies I feel  In vain I try their Force t'impart  They're more than Language can reveal  O then behold my dying Eyes  This trickling Tear my Pains may prove  Or read in these Heartrending Sighs  Silence is eloquent in Love  Since tho' your Cruelty can kill  Your Tenderness can bid me live  Then Mercy's soft Commands fulfil  And if you cannot blessforgive  By Nature to the  Indian  's shewn

Emblem of her Thought  The lovely Image to obtain  Tell her how long I sought in Vain  'Till  Waller  shew'd his heav'nly Strain  IV  Waller  who tunes his matchless Song  Soft as her Heart and as her Reason strong  Where'er she turns each Gazer views  Her Motion graceful as his Muse  Were'er she looks what Heart denies  His Fancy sparkles in her Eyes  O then convey with choicest Care  This faithful Mirror of my Fair  And softly whisper in her Ear  I seal'd it with a Kiss sincere  This Day that  leads  the circling Year  V  Tell her that  Time  is jealous grown  I count my Life by her

to renew  The pleasing Hours which once alas I knew  Hours no more pleasingthe dear Youth is gone  And with him ev'ry Happiness is flown  For ever must these Agonies remain  Still must I wish for Ease

 AMELIA to EUCRATES While on her DeathBed  ERE these sad Lines arrive which now I send  The fondest Husband and the truest Friend  Those tender  Titles  will no longer prove  The  living Tokens  of our  mutual Love  The Hint of this Piece is taken from a Letter in the SPECTATOR To Colonel R S in SPAINWhich the Reader may find in VOL No  No more furviveFor since that fatal Day  When from my Bosom thou wert torn away  The  rigid Call  of Honor to obey  My Malady's increas'd my End I see  And Health and Joy and Life all fled with thee  THAT fond Regard I owe the best of Men  Alone enables me to use my Pen  The Pain to write I scarce can undergo  And my Tears trickle where the Ink shou'd flow  Yet the sole Terror Death presents to View  Oh muchlov'd Consort is to part from you  Else wherefore should I fear his sure Behest  No unrepenting Folly loads my Breast  No Guilt inexpiate I leave behind  No vicious Love that dares  pollute  my Mind  But in reflecting on those tender Hours  When Love and Peace and Happiness were ours  I reenjoy our ev'ry  Pleasure  past  And sigh to think they can no longer last  Is this a Crime to wish their lasting Stay  And strive to put the Stroke of Death away  Nosure 'tis Piety's and Virtue's Task  For such Enjoyments Length of Days to ask  Those rapt'rous Moments once more to redeem  When Love and Love alone was  all  our Theme  When social Tenderness approv'd the Flame  And Friendship sanctify'd a Husbands Name  SINCE 'tis not ours t'explore the Work of Fate  But descant darkly on that future State  Where Vice shall meet it's due proportion'd Pain  And Virtue lasting Happiness attain  Why may we not  t'alleviate the Strife  'Twixt Hope and Fear when we resign this Life  At least indulge a Wish that we may know  Each Stroke that's aim'd at Mortals here below  And be employ'd perhaps to guide their Ways  With whom in Life we pass'd our guiltless Days  May I o'er thee a Guardian  Angel  plac'd  Unseen allay the Conflicts in thy Breast  No more as now a  weak  and  fearful  Mate  To  sigh  and  wish  away the Stroke of Fate  But meet Misfortune with undaunted Eye  Rush  boldly  on and Death's worst Pow'r defy  Incapable of Wound thy Steps attend  Thy lovely Face in  Battle  to defend  To view each threat'ning Danger from afar  And shield thee in the dreadful Hour of War  OR when a Fever rages thro' the Veins  Torn and inflam'd with agonizing Pains  Obsequious to tend the gloomy Bed  And in the drooping Moment raise thy Head  Infuse the  Balm  of  Patience  in thy Breast  In  Slumber  close thine Eyes and watch thy Rest  No greater Happiness can I implore  Be this my future LotI ask no more  BY these Ideas to my Fate resign'd  I  smile  at Death and cheer my languid Mind  But Oh  your  Torture when you must deplore  Your lost  Amelia  your's alas no more  Revives my Torment tears my lab'ring Heart  Now now I feel what Anguish 'tis to part  Your  Woes alone  too fatally  declare  That Death has Terrors and that I can fear  BUT holdmy Tenderness has rais'd a Pain  Which in oblivion ever should remain  Be dumb my Loveyet can I give relief  Or waft one Comfort to assuage thy Grief  NoConsolation will in Vain be sent  By her whose Loss your gen'rous Tears lament  Cease thenin  Silence  be my Pains exprest  My Moments now are shortOh guess the rest  If I'm myself my latest Breath shall flow  In Pray'rs for theethe least of what I owe  No more thy  muchlov'd  Image shall I view  No longer sigh my  Life  my  Soul  Adieu  The Name of a Gentleman's Seat in the County of KILKENNY

Guardian Guide Philosopher  and  Friend  IV  Not his the Pride of shining Spires  Uneasy Seat of high Desires  Nor glitt'ring Pomp of Equipage and Shew  But his to feel the Stranger's Sigh  To wipe

length'ning Shades of Night  The Landscape glimm'ring on the Sight  Her  palid Queen  with Rev'rence let me greet  While from above you  azure Hills  With solemn Joy my  Soul  she fills  And the dank  The Name of a River that runs through the County  Nore  slow murmurs at my Feet  IX  While yet the Infant Structure smil'd  Thus  Henry  ev'ry Care beguil'd  Thro' Acts long past Poetic thought can rove  'Child of my Hopes auspicious rise  'Omen of many future Joys  'And sacred Rest to  Ethelinda  's Love'  X  The  Walls  which Virtue thus did raise  Now vocal with their Maker  's  Praise  Full

Or dire Misfortune's worst Assail  Could  Henry Ethelinda  's Grief remove  On her is fix'd the  languid Eye  For her uprises ev'ry Sigh  As  all  his Joys are center'd in her Love  XII  While thus enwrapt in Thought I stray  Methinks I hear a Spirit say  'Here Virtue dwells and will forever rest  'But varies her unsettled Feet  'Nor yet can fix her lasting Seat  "Till with her  Ethelinda  's Presence blest  XIII  'She  Henry  's Heart with Love can warm  'With native Elegance can charm  'And add to Beauty Graces more refin'd  'With Converse sensible and gay  'Can smile domestic Hours away
