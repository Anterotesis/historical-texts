 MR SHERIDAN's ARGUMENT IN THE CASE OF DALY AGAINST MAGEE  MR SHERIDAN's ARGUMENT IN THE CASE OF  DALY AGAINST MAGEE  ON A MOTION TO DISCHARGE THE DEFENDANT ON COMMON BAIL  LONDON PRINTED AND DUBLIN REPRINTED FOR J MOORE No COLLEGEGREEN  â˜ž  It may be necessary just to mention for the Information of those not of the Profession of the Law That  A JUDGE's FIAT is a Warrant or Authority to the Officer of the Court to issue a Writ marked in such Sum as the Fiat directs on which Writ the Defendant is arrested and must either find Bail to the Amount of such Sum or remain in Prison  SPECIAL BAIL is Bail by Sureties to the amount of a certain Sum  COMMON BAIL is only an Appearance to the Action by Attorney without any Security  IN THE KING's BENCH  Michaelmas Term th Geo    DALY against MAGEE  MR JOHN MAGEE being in confinement under a Writ marked for the sum of  l  at the suit of the Plaintiff  for defamation  by Authority of A FIAT for that purpose granted by the Lord Chief Justice caused a notice of the following purport to be served on the Plaintiff's Attorney  SIR  COUNSEL on behalf of the Defendant will move the Court the first opportunity to set aside the  order made in this cause on the th day of June last whereby it was ordered that the Defendant should give SPECIAL BAIL in this cause to the amount of the sum marked at the foot of the Writ of  Capias ad respondendum  which issued in this cause and that the Defendant's COMMON APPEARANCE may be taken and stand without holding him to SPECIAL BAIL But if the Court should not be pleased to grant such motion Counsel will then move the Court to vary the said order and that the sum for which the said writ was marked and the Defendant thereby required to find Bail to such amount may be REDUCED from  l  to  l  and the notice concludes in such case with a tender of Bail to the amount of  the last mentioned sum  NB Similar Notices were served in the case of Brennan against Magee Tracy against Magee and Higgins against Magee who had severally obtained Fiats on the ground of DEFAMATION  MR SHERIDAN  MY LORDS  I am in this case Counsel for Mr  John Magee  the alledged Proprietor of a News Paper called The  Dublin Evening Post  and I could wish that the notice on his behalf and on which I move had not a double aspect I could wish that it had been confined to his claim of  right  and not extended to an application for  favor  When we move that a  common appearance  may be taken without holding him to  Special Bail  a great question of constitutional and public importance is involved in the subject but when we apply to  reduce  the sum the application appears like an appeal to the  discretion  of the Court My duty to my client obliges me to submit my observations in each point of view though I should rather argue it in the abstract for another reason I might thereby avoid the strange stuff and material which the Plaintiff has introduced as  merits  into his affidavit and I might thereby avoid to use a dramatic quotation in a case partly theatrical  that stile of speech  "which though it may make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of one of whom outweighs in my mind a whole theatre of others"  My Lords I am in this case with due deference to contend that the learned Judge was not warranted by  law  in issuing his Fiat for  any sum  for that in this case  common bail  which is no more than  an appearance  for the party and properly speaking no bail at all is all that the  law  requires but if your Lordships shall be of opinion that the learned Judge was authorised by law in issuing such Fiat holding the Defendant to  l  bail then I am to submit to your Lordships that you are bound in conscience to reduce the sum because you are bound and it is the true spirit of the law to hold him to no greater bail than in your conscience you shall think the  Plaintiff can recover  and here my Lords it is necessary to call your attention to the affidavit of the Plaintiff it is  his case  and therefore I presume put in the strongest and best manner that the nature of that case would allow it is the ground upon which a Judge's Fiat for  l  issued and there never was an affidavit containing the grievance of the party complaining more  weak  and more  defective  THERE IS NOT THROUGHOUT  THIS AFFIDAVIT A SINGLE PER QUOD The allegded Libel is libellous only by  forced  construction by  violent  interpretation of an apparently  unmeaning  poem the damages in amount are so far from approaching to  any  degree of certainty that it is rather obvious that  none  were  actually  sustained it  hints  at damages which  may be  not which  are  suffered and such damages are  imaginary  they are  poetic  they are in the  fancy  the  conception  of the party  interested  of him who seeks redress in  damages  Mr  Richard Daly  stiles himself in this his affidavit Manager of the Theatre Royal in the City of Dublin He states that the Defendant Mr  John Magee  is as he believes Printer and Publisher of a certain News Paper called The  Dublin Evening Post  in which Paper he  John Magee  caused to be published a defamatory Poem of the  tenor  in the Affidavit  I should be sorry to feel myself under any necessity to recite this Poem to the Court it is in truth a very strange composition but may have its merit with those who understand it but as it is the cause of a Fiat for  l  and as it contains or rather is itself the offence for which my client is in duress until he shall procure bail to that amount I have selected and shall faithfully  state such passages or parts of this poem as by  possibility  may be deemed libellous  "  The Gamblers retired and Roscius alone  "  I am free to admit that Mr  Daly  being Manager of the Theatre  may be  the Roscius intended by the Poet but this concession is somewhat unnecessary as Mr  Daly  in his Affidavit swears that  he  is the person so described or in other words  that he is  ROSCIUSHow far this may be a Libel on Roscius deceased on Roscius the companion of Cicero the name at least will scarcely be deemed a Libel on Roscius the companion of Higgins  Roscius laments  "  That humble Actresses will no longer obedient bend  "  That  "  Francisco now delights the admiring throng  "  He then proceeds to kill himself  "  The tragic tin bent harmless on his breast  "  Then Cupid arrives to whom Roscius says  "  Does some lady court me to her arms  "  And buy with brilliant gold my manly charms  "  Cupid replies  "  There live he said some men of fame well known  "  For punctual dealing and to candour prone  "  the Wights have money  "  Honesty against cunning has no force  "  we'll fleece the villains  Here a Judge is to conceive and a jury hereafter are to conceive that the LotteryOffice Keepers are understood who sometime ago were so successfully and so  surprisingly  hit I am endeavouring to give to this silly poem all the wicked effect that conjecture can admit  "  I know the wily plot  RICARDO  cry'd  "  The  DOCTOR  in those schemes is fully try'd  "  The  DOCTOR  sails to the Cambrian shore  "  Then straight to the enchanted fane  "  the priests the cabalistic numbers cry  "  The Doctor ties them round a pigeon's neck  "  who flies  "  And on Francisco's portal plumes his wings  "  These are the  criminal  extracts from the alledged Libel a poem full of nonsense ribaldry and bombast not to be matched in a Mock Tragedy truly farcical were it not that the sum of  l  has changed the performance to a TragiComedy  For the publication of this poem the defendant has been arrested under a writ issued by authority of a Fiat and marked for  l  My Lords there have been of late and I lament it many bold impudent plain and indefensible Libels why are the weakest selected to disgrace the records of the Court and to bring contempt upon the Justice of the countryAnd now my Lords let me call your attention to what ought to be the  material  part of an affidavit to warrant a Fiat in any case to that part which relates to  the damage sustained  In this case the  single instance  in which the Plaintiff  endeavours  to shew any special damage HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT and the fair inference from his own words is that he has suffered  little if any  After swearing that he had expended considerable sums in the embellishment of the Theatre Royal and that he has hitherto supported a good repute and credit he proceeds and states in his affidavit  "that by the false and scandalous publications concerning him he has already experienced their injurious tendency  as  a very eminent performer whom he had retained in Great Britain to act at his Theatre in this City did from the false and scandalous publications against him express  a doubt  of  his credit and punctuality and that therefore  a large  and  considerable  sum must be paid in advance and  if it had not been  for the interference of some friends  he would have been deprived  of the advantage of such performer"  Now what is the inference herehe advanced nothing and the actress came and fulfilled her engagementtake it that he did advance  how much  and where is the magnitude of the injury in advancing to a performer a sum  on account  if the manager ever intended to pay and this is the  only  statement of an injury  actually  sustained  The use of indefinite words in an affidavit may be sometimes very convenient but when injury is to be redressed in damages and the party held to bail the security should be proportioned to the probable redress and the law requires some measure whereby such security may be  limited  and not  extended  The Plaintiff in this case feeling perhaps that a Fiat for  l  on the ground he has stated and which I have followed would be as ridiculous as it is outrageous adds that he has children among whom are sour growingup daughters  who in their  future  prospects in life  may  receive considerable injury and he then swears that he has  good reason  to be  convinced  he  has  suffered damages to the amount of FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS and upwardshowby an  advance  to a performer and the injuries his family or himself  may hereafter  suffer See my Lords the danger that might arise from any man carving the measure of his own redress in estimating the value of the injury he has sustained that which is but  ideal  will become  real  and he will tell you he has  good reason  to be  convinced  and I beseech your Lordships attention to this because it illustrates the doctrine of the law which I shall submit to you with respect to  bail  in actions of  defamation  The Plaintiff concludes his affidavit in stating that John Magee the Defendant gives out that he is a man of  very considerable property  as well in money as in several News Papers Why this is introduced I cannot discover it is introduced  as true  and if true it is a reason for a common appearance because the Plaintiff himself alledges a sufficient responsibility in the Defendant whom he sues  The Defendant John Magee has made an affidavit in aid of the present application in which  he swears that a writ issued in or as of last Trinity Term to the Sheriffs of the City of  Dublin  marked for the sum of  l  under authority of a Fiat granted by the Lord Chief Justice and founded on an affidavit of Richard Daly the Plaintiff that upon such writ he was arrested in  June  last that in consequence of a number of vexatious suits and prosecutions against him and in consequence of the proceedings in this cause and from the reiterated abuse he has received in the Freeman's Journal he is extremely injured in his credit insomuch that though he has used every effort in his power  he cannot now procure bail in this cause for the amount of the sum marked at the foot of said writ  or to any larger amount than  l  and saith he verily believes that the Plaintiff hath not suffered damage in this cause to any amount whatsoever  Your Lordships have now before you the facts or merits of the case but I trust your Lordships will decide on a great question of public and of constitutional importance without any reference to the particular circumstances of the present case I reject them as unnecessary save only to the second part of the application the  reducement  of the bail which will also become unnecessary if your Lordships shall be of opinion that the Defendant  is not bound by law to give  any security whatever  Then my Lords I with confidence assert that  a common appearance  is all the law requires in actions of  defamation  and to compel  any security  to  any amount  is an  extortion  on the subject and  illegal  It is pleasing to observe in what great esteem the law holds  personal freedom  justly considering the general liberty of the subject as dependant on that of the individual and so tender has the law been of this liberty that no man could be deprived of his personal freedom unless for some  criminal flagrant  offence injurious to the government under which he lived or for some  tortius  act committed with  force  and consequently  in breach of the peace  which his allegiance and duty required him to keep and preserve It is thus well expressed in  Crompton  's admirable introduction to a late very excellent compilation  I grant that the legal requisition of bail properly called Special Bail is and has been for many years less confined but then it has been extended from  necessity  and upon  principle  as in DEBTwhat is the rule of lawif the debt  absolutely  amounts to a sum  certain  then the debtor may be held to  special bail  but where the demand is not  absolute  but  uncertain  and sounds in damagesNOT SOAnd the principle isthe Plaintiff shall not be the  judge  of the injury he cannot  ascertain  because it would make the Defendant the victim of the Plaintiff's  conception  A Judge indeed may in several cases grant a Fiat to hold a party to special bail but in every case it can only be where the demand is  certain  as IN DEBT or where the injury is  so outrageous  that damages must  necessarily  have been suffered there the Judge has some  measure  some  guide  but even there he is bound to be  moderate  for in the language of the Bill of Rights  "excessive bail ought not to be required"  And here my Lords I think I take the doctrine in its utmost latitude In cases of DEFAMATION or SLANDER save only  two  exceptions which I shall mention a Judge is not warranted to grant a Fiat for the Defendant shall be held only to  common bail  As to SPECIAL BAIL cases of defamation are excepted in every authority from the oldest down to  Crompton's  late Digest on the subject  The first mention of Special Bail in slander was in the reign of  Charles  II and that only in the case of  slandering the title of lands  previous to that time special bail was required in no case of  personal  slander Afterwards special bail was extended to  Scandalum Magnatum  and no further so that the two exceptions evidently support the doctrine  In  Crompton  title BAIL "in trespass assault battery conspiracy false imprisonment there shall be  common bail  only  unless on a motion or order made by the Court or a Judge  your Lordships will observe that this saving of motion or order applies only to  such  actions in which in the first instance common bail is all the law requires and you will observe what follows  "IN SLANDER common bail  only  unless in slander of  title  and  then  common or special in the discretion of the Court"  This is laid down as the law in  Michaelmas  and the authority adds as the practice  after  that period  "  or unless spoken of a person of quality  "  This complimentary concession was introduced perhaps considering peers as the hereditary legislators of the realm the king's hereditary counsellors and forming the Court of ultimate appeal and final jurisdiction the welfare of the empire depending  in a degree on  their  good name and reputation So in  Ray  Earl of  Stampford  against  Goodall  "in  scandalum magnatum  the Plaintiff may have special bail on motion and order"  Lord Chief Baron  Comyn  in his Digest Vol I Fol enumerates the cases where special bail may be required where the debt or damage in an action of debt detinue trespass action upon the case  except in slander  amounts to  l  SPECIAL BAIL so where the damages are  uncertain  the Judges in their discretion may grant special bail as in battery  if it appears to be outrageous  in conspiracy false imprisonment  in slander of title  or  scandalum magnatum  There in  slander  special bail is  confined  to the two instances in the cases where special bail is allowed of  right  it is founded on the  certainty  of the injury where it arises from  discretion  it is measured by the  enormity  of the offence  In  Blackstone    Smith  against  Frazer  In trespass and assault the Plaintiff made affidavit before  Forster  Justice to hold the Defendant to bail  on the flagrant circumstances of which  he directed  l  bail to be given  My Lords there is not any distinction taken with respect to  bail  between slander written and  uttered between defamation by  libel  or  parole  there is no variance as to the doctrine to be found in the books and the  principle  cannot be affected by the  nature  or  class  of the DEFAMATION    Siderfin    Chetwin  against  Skinner  it is there laid down  "in action sur le case pur parole  ou outrement  NUL SPE BAIL"  I call upon gentlemen to shew any distinction taken in any authority between slander  written  and SLANDER  spoken with respect to the doctrine of bail  I know there are distinctions between  libel  and slander  spoken  I know one has justly a greater degree of criminality annexed to it than the other but with regard to  bail  I say DEFAMATION is the general head including every species of slander written painted engraved spoken  ou outrement  or otherwise  My Lords so tenacious is the law of personal liberty and so tender have Judges been with regard to it that even in cases where the law recognised and allowed special bail where even the ground of the application seemed fair and reasonable Courts have refused to hold the subject to special bail because the case  might not  ultimately warrant it  In  Strange    Heathcot  against  Goslin  The affidavit to hold to bail was that the Defendant borrowed  l  of the Plaintiff on bottomree  which money is now due and owing  to this Deponent by virtue of the said bond  as thereby may appear  Objected that this was no oath of the debt for suppose every penny is paid and a separate receipt taken yet upon the face of the bond the whole will appear due  et per curiam  it is not sufficient the Plaintiff would have made a  supplemental  affidavit but the court refused to receive it for the act of parliament requires a full oath previous to the issuing the process that Defendants may not be  harased  and therefore in this case the Defendant was discharged upon  common  bail  In the present case Mr  Daly  has made a  subsequent  affidavit but such affidavit could be no ground for the arrest for it was not  in esse  when the Fiat was granted    Strange    Gammage  against  Watkin  The original debt was  under  the sum entitled to special bail but the costs swelled it  over  and the Plaintiff had judgment on which he brought debt and held the Defendant to bail and now upon motion the court ordered  common bail  to be accepted for as the original demand did not require  bail the addition of costs will not alter the case  And yet my Lords here the costs and the original demand were liquidated and in law became  one debt  but the Court in its decision guided by attention and attachment to personal liberty made the distinction in its favour and the like attention and attachment appear to govern in every case    Burrow    Pomp  vers  Ludrigson  A rule for discharging the Defendant upon  common  bail was made absolute the affidavit to hold him to  special  bail  not  being  possitive  which it is the established rule of the court  "that it  must  be"  This was the case of a merchant in  London  whose correspondent in  Sweden  had sent him over the accounts from  Sweden where the debt arose  and consequently the Plaintiff the merchant in  London  could only swear to his  belief  with a  reference  to the accounts sent to him from  Sweden  the fact itself not being within his own personal knowledge so that the affidavit could not have been more positive than it was unless the correspondent in  Sweden  could have come over to  London  to swear it    Strange    Rios  vers  Relifante  The affidavit to hold to  special  bail was made by a merchant in  London  swearing that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff  l  as appears by an affidavit made by the Plaintiff in  Amsterdam  which he the Deponent  believes  to be true  et per curiam  there can only be  common  bail the oath abroad is no ground and there is nothing but  belief  which is not sufficient  Your Lordships will observe that these are  commercial  cases and from the nature of commerce and the situation of parties connected with it similar cases may every day occur yet we find no attempt at an argument founded on  necessity  or  public benefit  to extend the power of the Court    Strange    Claphamson  vers  Bowman  The Plaintiff's BOOKKEEPER swore that the Defendant was indebted to the Plaintiff in  l  for money had and received by the Defendant to the use of the Plaintiff  as this Deponent verily believes  and the Court held it not sufficient to hold the Defendant to  special  bail  This was the case of a  bookkeeper  swearing as fully as he conscientiously could no merchant keeps his own books because he cannot be a witness  to prove any debt due to himself his clerk who must be his witness who should be privy to the dealing and who keeps the account can scarcely extend his oath were he ever so correct beyond the best of his belief yet in such case if the charge be not POSITIVE  common  bail only is allowed    Strange    Walrond  vers  Fransham  an executrix in order to hold the Defendant to bail made an affidavit that he was indebted to her testator so much  as appears by the books of the testator  and it was held insufficient and  common  bail ordered  Here could have been no  positive  affidavit the creditor was dead the Plaintiff was an executrix and sued in such right the office is highly favoured in law the assets of which credits may make a principal part are committed for the best purposes and among the first the payment of the testator's debts yet in this case the case I say of an  executrix  suing in the right of another in whom no private or personal interest could be presumed and laying before the Court the best foundation in her power  common  bail only  Compare my Lords such cases with the present and can you doubt compare such affidavits with that of Mr Daly whose  present  losses are the conjecture surmise apprehension and belief of  future  injuries  The cases I have quoted are cases within the description and reach of  special  bail the case of Daly is that of  defamation  entitled only as I apprehend to  common  bail certainly to no more where no  actual  damage is sworn to have been suffered certainly not to the extent which confines him  before  trial to an amount which might be considered as excessive in damages  after  verdict  But my Lords laying aside the parties and the particular circumstances of the case what is the great and important questionif the extensive and extending conscience of a suitor partial to himself in fancied injuries and imaginary ills can impose on the credulity of a Judge if the Judge may at his  discretion  hold a subject in prison  previous to trial  on terms with which he cannot comply the  discretion  of the Judge may become the  pleasure  of the Man where then will be the difference between FIAT and LETTER DE CACHET if such be the practice  we are not safe  we have obtained  nothing by the glorious Revolution we have no security in the great Charter in the Bill of Rights in the Habeas Corpus the atchievements of liberty may decorate the monument of a former constitution or be like standards taken from an enemy hung up old torn and useless save only to shew a degraded posterity the virtue and valour of their ancestorsNo my Lords I trust that a great and able Judge will this day add a brighter glory to his name his rank and office than any in the power of Majesty to confer by nobly saying what the best have said and what none but the best will say  I have been wrong  a generous and a grateful people will applaud bless record the expression and honour even the error that caused it  FINIS
