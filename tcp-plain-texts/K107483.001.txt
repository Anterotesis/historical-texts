 THE PLAIN DEALER BEING SELECT ESSAYS ON SEVERAL CURIOUS SUBJECTS RELATING TO  FRIENDSHIP  LOVE and  GALLANTRY  MARRIAGE  MORALITY  MERCANTILE  AFFAIRS  PAINTING  HISTORY  POETRY  AND Other  Branches  of POLITE LITERATURE  Publish'd Originally in the YEAR And now first Collected into TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON Printed for  S Richardson  and  A Wilde  And sold by A BETTESWORTH J OSBORN and T LONGMAN and J BATLEY in  PaterNoster  Row W INNYS J KNAPTON and C RIVINGTON in St  Paul  's ChurchYard J CLARKE in  DuckLane  and J LEAKE at  Bath  MDCCXXX  THE PREFACE  T  HO' such  ESSAYS  as com∣pose the following  Volumes  are in  Universal Esteem  and liable to every One's  Observations  yet it has not been my Fortune to meet with any  Discourse  written purposely upon the  Nature  of them The  ESSAYISTS  are apt to beat the  Imagi∣nation  in Search of  strange  and  exotick Sub∣jects  to write upon while a  Disquisition  into their own  Works  which are capable of afford∣ing  Matter  so ample seems to be intirely over∣looked by  Them  In this resembling the human  Mind  which while it enters into and examines the  Depth  of all other  Sciences  seems to consider nothing less than its own  Motions  MOST other Kinds of  Writing  have I think been the  Objects  of  Criticism  and  Rules  and  Orders  have been laid down for the  Writers  of them to  Observe  but in this  Spe∣cies  nobody is confin'd The only  Rule  that I know and it is generally well observed is not only to go without but to go against all  Order  and  Method  whatsoever  Montaigne  if I mistake not was the  Inventor  of it and  He  is in all its  Beauties  and  Faults  the best  Pat∣tern  to examine it by  He  has a great deal of  Wit  much good  Observation  and some  Learn∣ing  but his  ESSAYS  are wild rambling and incoherent some of them don't treat at all of the  Subjects  propos'd and others might as well have any other Title as those they wear They are in effect like Mr  Bays  's  Prologue  that would do either as  Prologue  or  Epilogue  or serve indifferently for any other  Play  as well as that which it was written for  THO' there are to be found among the  An∣tients  some little  Tracts  upon particular  Subjects  which if they were written at this  Time  would be called  ESSAYS  yet as they were generally if we except the  Symposiacks  of  Plutarch  made by  Receipts  and done with a View to the  Rules  which  Orators  and  Declai∣mers  laid down for such  Compositions  the Honour of this  Invention  must still be ascribed to  Montaigne  who first introduced that useful  Practice  of  Digression  into  Treatises  upon select  Subjects  and by giving us every whimsical  Con∣ceit  that came into his Head has led us as it were dancing after his  Morality  much more pleasantly  than if we walked in the Stilts or were di∣rected by the LeadingStrings which  Seneca  had accustomed us to  Montaigne  had a great many Followers in  France  and some in this Country But the best and he that excelled his  Original  was  La Bruyere  the finest and most delicate  Remarks  the strongest  Sense  and the justest  Reasoning  all embellished by an Elegance of  Style  and a Felicity of  Expression  are to be found in his  Works  to which we must add that the frequent  Egotisms  the needless  Quo∣tations  the whimsical  Display  of the Author's  Character  and  Manners  at every Period and other Impertinences which pass upon some for  Humour  are not to be met with in him He has all the  Variety  and an Appearance of the  Irregularity  which pleases but intirely divested of the  Digression  and  Distraction  which consound and disgust the  READER  in these Performan∣ces In short reading  Montaigne  is Hunt∣ing in a Country where you start so much  Game  as to spoil your  Sport  while  La Bruyere  gives you all the  Pleasure  and  Variety  of the  Chace  without the Fatigue of following the  Prey  too far  WITHOUT arraigning the  Taste  of others I will venture to say That very little in this Way worth  Observation  has appeared at Home till the  TATLER  began to retail his Pennyworths of  WIT  Several  Political Tracts  it is true have come forth and some  Argumentative Discourses  which had their  Shares of  Merit  but did not come properly within this Species of  Writing  The Character of  BICKERSTAFFE  had it been real was more upon the  Humourist  and  Whimsical  than that of  Montaigne  and I believe the Fiction which was seen in it by being natural heighten'd the Pleasure which it gave us besides the Limits of his Paper prevented his being so diffuse and prolix as we often find the  Frenchman  who for want of such a Confinement sometimes dis∣gusts us The  SPECTATOR  and  NESTOR IRONSIDE  are  Characters  also excellently well adapted to the Creation of our  Pleasures  by our  Knowledge  of their being Fictitious For such is our Malignity of  Temper  that we can't forgive a real  Author  acting or thinking oddly or idly though our  Entertainment  arises from thence because we consider him as a rea∣sonable Man and obliged by a superior  Duty  to another kind of  Behaviour  but we can in∣dulge an imaginary or assumed Personage in any ludicrous frolicksome or whimsical  Words  or  Opinions  because we know that he only plays the  Fool  for our  Delight  and  Amusement  which we grudge him to do for his own Thus  Montaigne  's Faults are the Beauties of  BICKERSTAFFE  and  IRONSIDE  and thus  Cibber  and  Hippesly  are applauded on the  Stage  for what they would in private  Life  run the Ha∣zard of  Correction  CERTAINLY writing under an assump∣tive  Character  is a fine Improvement in this  Way  and I believe the  Novelty  of it without derogating from the  Wit Humour  good  Sense  or excellent  Style  of those mentioned  Papers  made up the greatest Part of their  Merit  The little Incidents of human  Life  Pieces of  Conversation  and familiar  Arguments  which may be thrown into  Writing  under such a  Cha∣racter  give it the  Advantage  of all other  Me∣thods  And I am of  Opinion  it must eternally  Please  and the Success of the following  Papers  when first publish'd corroborates the Opinion if as new  Matter  is continually rising some  Geni∣us's  could be found able to treat it in a Manner equal to their  Predecessors  Tho' perhaps  The Stamp Act  first and then the Rise and Multi∣plication of  Weekly Journals  are now such Im∣pediments to a fair Hearing in this  Method  as almost amount to a  Prohibition  of such  ESSAYS  for the future  THE Invention of  Weekly Journals  was I believe owing to the  Taste  which the Town be∣gan to entertain from the Writings of the  TATLER SPECTATOR  and others Small  ESSAYS  were so much liked that it was imagined worth while to put a little  Wit  and a great deal of  History  in a large Quantity of Pa∣per and sell it for the same or a less Price than  The Stamp Duty  had rais'd the half Sheet  Treatise  to The  Project  succeeded and we have had several excellent  Things  publish'd in that  Way  some that in their  Fame  almost rivall'd any  Thing  that went before them but  by the Nature of their  Subjects  ought to be excluded from this  Class  of  Writing  which whatever Liberties Men take ought never to be drawn into Controversies about  Religion  or  Government  Things that to be sure require a more orderly and regular manner of Treating than is consistent with the Freedom and Latitude of an  ESSAY  BUT as I hinted before we have almost lost the Advantage of  Entertaining  in any other  Manner  the  Journals  come abroad so seldom that if a  Humour  was begun Men would for∣get it before it could be prosecuted and the  Jest  would be lost before it was found The general Way now of communicating our  Thoughts  to the Publick is by distinct and unconnected  Letters  to the  Author  of this or that  Journal  and the common assumed  Characters  are a  Phi∣losopher  a  Critick  or a  Divine  in these some important  Point  is constantly laid down and as gravely and solemnly discussed Thus we intrude upon the  Pulpit  and seem not to think that to mend the  Heart  it is necessary to please the  Imagination  THIS certainly is missing the  Mark  and these little  ESSAYS  are written in the truest  Taste  when they cloath good  Sense  with  Humour  and embellish good  Morals  with  Wit  when they instruct  Familiarly  and reprove  Pleasantly  when they don't swell above  Com∣prehension  nor sink below  Delicacy  In short  when they adapt the  Wisdom  of the  Antients  to the  Gust  of the  Moderns  and constrain  Montaigne  's Pleasantry within  BICKERSTAFFE  's Compass  I CAN'T conclude without mentioning two Objections which amongst others these Sort of  Writings  and their  Authors  are liable to the first is That as from the  Nature  of their Subjects it is often necessary they should be  Occasional  which requires  Dispatch  and pre∣vents that  Accuracy  which much  Leisure  and frequent  Reviews  generally produce in other  Works  that in such Cases to sketch out or design well is as much as can be performed which certainly can give the  Mind  but a half  Pleasure  and so far the  Work  must necessarily be  Imperfect  THE Second is to be found in  Ben Johnson  's Discoveries which therefore take in his own Words  SOME that turn over all Books and are equally searching in all Papers that write out of what they presently find or meet without Choice by which means it happens that what they have discredited and impug∣ned in one Work they have before or after extolled the same in another Such are all the  Essayists  even their Master  Montaigne  These in all they write confess still what Books they have read last and therein their  own Folly so much that they bring it to the Stake  raw  and  undigested  Not that the Place did need it neither but that they thought themselves furnished and would vent it  THESE  Objections  had not been mention∣ed but that we believe the following  Pieces  stand clear of them the Reception which was at first given them encourages us in that  Thought  and it is hoped That from a Peru∣sal of them the candid  READER  will enter∣tain the same  Opinion  THE PLAIN DEALER N  o  I  VOL I  Hoc est  Vivere bis Vita posse priore frui  MART  MONDAY  March    W  HEN a  Stranger  comes into Com∣pany the Whisper goes round  Who is He  and the Face each Man wears is the Effect of his In∣formation You ought therefore to know who I  am  that you may regard what I  say  and then it is to be hop'd we shall converse without Jealousy  I AM a talkative  Old Batchelor  in my grand Climacterick of a sanguine Complexion welllimb'd strong and hearty in Stature more than middling my Face is round and smooth  my Forehead high and open my Eyebrows are widely arch'd my Teeth sound and white I have a Nose a little  Aquiline  Eyes black and spritely my Hair is brown and short but somewhat of the thinnest with a Silver∣ing of Grey among it I wear my Cloaths plain am a great Lover of Walking and go commonly alone I carry a pair of Mousecolour'd Gloves in one Hand and my Oaken Stick in the other instead of a Cane for I am naturally partial to the Manufactures of my Country and an irreconcileable Enemy to the  EastIndia Company  MY Father who was one of the  Cavaliers  of the last Century had a  Dash  in his  Temper  of what his Mistresses called  Surly  but he was of frank Heart and simple Manners There was an unlucky kind of Contrast in his Dis∣position for he was Amorous but Unpolish'd He seems to have been rather Serious than Witty yet he lov'd Wit in others and was particularly charm'd with the Wantonness of Mrs  Behn  That arch Baggage has made bold in her Comedy called the  Rover  both with his Name and his CharacterWho∣ever has seen  Ned Blunt  has seen not the  Copy  but the very  Life  of my Father  HE left me an Estate rather moderate than plentiful which I have neither improv'd nor diminish'd I was naturally dispos'd to Quiet and affected to think calmly For this  Reason  I have obstinately resisted MARRIAGE I pass my Summers at  BluntHall  the ancient  Seat of our Family in the dirtiest Part of  Sussex  My Winters I enjoy in Town where I am the oldest Member now alive of an Assem∣bly of both Sexes very numerous and diver∣sified We meet twice a Week at the House of a sober Widow whom we placed there on Purpose But because I delight in Study and am an Enemy to the Faction and Flutter of the Polite End of the Town I have my Lodgings in a lowbuilt silent House in the City which has a large shady Garden and covers the very  Spot  where of old as  Stow  tells me stood the WatchTower of  Barbican  IT has always been my Custom To keep a daily Account in Writing of my Actions and Observations even to Particulars of no seem∣ing Importance By Help of these Notes I live over again my past Time and learn Wis∣dom from my FolliesI have lately been reflecting and taken it stongly into my Fancy That wanting Children of my own I should be Every Body's Father I have so many Things to say and am so naturally fond of  Teaching  that I promise my self no small  Fame  from the Success of my Weekly Coun∣sel The SUBJECT of my PAPER gave me little or no Pain My Propensity to Talking required That it should be  General  and  Un∣boundedly Copious  But the NAME was a  Dif∣ficulty  that I could not easily get over That  Large  Part of Mankind which consists of SUPERFICIALISTS judging every Thing by Ap∣pearance  taste  but coldly of a Meaning which  is not  dress'd  to their  Relish  and the  Will  that is too stubborn to bend to the  Fancy  shall hard∣ly be able to work upon the  Understanding  THIS Doubt was so knotty that I sub∣mitted it to the  Assembly  where a learned  Clergyman  spoke first and was for calling it the INQUISITOR He was honestly proceed∣ing to give his  Reasons  for that Name but was smartly interrupted by an  Alderman  's Wife who with Eyes full of Fire and Face as red as her Ribbands told him  That however the  Inquisition  might agree with  His  Principles it would never go down with  honest  People and  Protestants  If you desire  said she to me  That your  PAPER  should be read by the  Friends  of the  Government  you should give it a  sober  Name and call it the  TRUTHTELLER  A pert  Coquet  who sate next her a Toast and a great Fortune burst into a loud Laugh  Oh Heavens  cry'd the Gipsey  I shall faint at the odious Formality of that  Title  Ah Ma∣dam How could you be so unreasonably mistaken The  TRUTHTELLER  Lord deliver us why the  COURT  can never bear it and all the  gay World  will despise and abhor itNo no if you wish your  PAPER  to  Spread  and grow  Publick  you have nothing to resolve but to call it the  SECRET  FOR my Part  answered a grave Virgin about Fifty  I think they would do well to entitle it the  COQUET  There's scarce a Fop in Town but would be fond of that Name for he would consider the  PAPER  as his  Property  A FAMOUS  Critick  interposing remark'd  That the  Taste  of the Age was so vitiated that no Name could be acceptable unless it were  Mu∣sical  and the  Wind says he  of Modern Ar∣guments being an Overmatch for their  Weight  I am for calling it the  BAGPIPE  Oh much rather the  FLUTE  reply'd the  Coquet  The  BAGPIPE  is so filthy so horrible an Instru∣ment that 'twould be impossible to bear the Sound of it unless 'twere introduc'd in an  Opera  A  Justice  of the  Quorum  my next Neigh∣bour in the Country and an eminent  Foxhunter  maintain'd with invincible Strength both of  Voice  and  Authority That it ought by all Means since it was intended for  Society  to be called the  GOOD FELLOW But he bow'd and chang'd his Mind when our  Alderman's Young Daughter  who sate at her Mother's Elbow blush'd and whisper'd in his Ear  That for her Part she could think of no Name that would be so pretty as the  SWEET∣HEART  AN  Old Maid  of the Widow's to whom for Pleasantrysake we indulge the Familiari∣ty and Privilege of Impertinence had been standing all this while behind her Mistress's Chair and broke out on a sudden with an Air of Amazement  Hey Day if you must  whip  it about thus and keep it constantly spin∣ning the best Thing you can do is To call it the  WHIRLIGIG All the Company laugh'd at the Wench's Conceit 'till the  Critick  assume∣ing a surpriz'd and decisive Air assur'd us  positively  It  must  take for that No Body could fail to expect as much Wit at least in the  WHIRLIGIG  as in the  Whatd'yecall it  I was unsatisfied with All This and having a natural Partiality to my own Character I bethought myself of the PLAIN DEALER The whole Assembly agreed in Approbation of That Name and gave it as their JointOpinion  That Whether it would be generally  liked  or no it was never more generally  wanted  THE  LADIES  when they hear That my Design is PLAIN DEALING will consider me perhaps as an Oldfashion'd Fellow who can have nothing to do with Them yet I know they will be frequently kind enough to furnish me with Business and I shall handle them as often as they allow me OpportunityThe CHURCH and the STATE I have no great Genius for meddling with They are either  well  as they  are  or will never be the  better  for any Thing I can  say  to them But the  Passions  the  Humours  the  Follies  the  Disquiets  the  Plea∣sures  and the  Graces  of  Human Life  All these I claim a Right to consider as my Subjects and shall treat them without Prejudice in the most frank and open Manner so that the  WatchTower  of  Barbican  shall again resume its Use and  overlook  this Antient CITY for Her  Ser∣vice  and Her  Safety  THE PLAIN DEALER N  o  II  Ridentem dicere verum  Quis Vetat  HOR  FRIDAY  March    THREE Enormous Abuses have grown of late Years to a scandalous Heighth among us  Masquerading Gaming  and  StockJobbing  They are Enemies to the Civil So∣ciety of Mankind and Destroyers of that va∣luable Doctrine of PLAIN DEALING which I would so earnestly recommend  MASQUERADES  are the Undoers of Beau∣ty Honour and Innocence and methinks it should be enough to deter any young  Lady  if she did but reflect upon this Great Truth That her Masque has at best thrown a Cloud upon her Reputation that will hang heavy for a long Time after and sink her in the Esteem of her former Admirers  AS to  Gaming  the Sons of our Nobility and the Heirs to plentiful Estates especial∣ly those who become too early their own Masters are the Victims of Sharpers the Prey of those Manhunters who form Asso∣ciations  to overturn as many Honest So∣cieties as they can and only live in Peace to∣gether by being united in a Confederacy to spread Desolation among others The Heads of our best Families may not improperly be called the GAME of this widewasting Fra∣ternity  STOCKJOBBING  is the Overthrow of all regular Commerce and involves many a rich Trader in the utmost Distress  THESE Three Grand Enormities stand in direct Opposition to PLAIN DEALING and the Province which I have undertaken demands of me to declare War against them and exert my best Endeavours to remove them out of the Way as fast as I am able They grow out of the Obliquity of a Mind that meditates an unnatural Increase of its own Ease by di∣minishing the Satisfaction of other People and filling them with Uneasiness and Disquiet These Subjects are so fruitful that I shall im∣ploy this whole Paper upon the  Masquerades  alone and defer the Correction of the other to a second Opportunity  THE  Count  of the  illfavour'd Visage  may may be considered as the Leader and CaptainGeneral of these Forces and therefore if in entring into a single Combat with him I am valiant enough to get the better I doubt not but the Army under his Command will pull off their Masques in Respect to my Victory and not be ashamed to shew their Faces when they appear on the side that is uppermost  THEY who lay  Masques  to the  Count  's Charge have accounted for it very pleasantly and will have it to be a politick Undertaking He ought say they by the Laws of Sympathy to have Regard to a Vizor since his  natural  Countenance bears such Resemblance to those  artificial  ones that the only means in his Power to look like a  Man  was to teach every Man to look like a  Monster  BUT I am not in a Humour to content my self with such abstracted Speculations which appear to me to be artfully framed on purpose to  excuse  a Man they pretend to find fault with It is true they make a Jest of the Person but they throw a  Masque  over the Mind which ought certainly to be most cha∣stised I dare swear for the  Count  it is not his nature to be angry with any Body that by handling his  Face  a little  freely  gives him a  handsome  Opportunity for handling the  Pockets  of other People  Greater  Statesmen than  He  have been contented to look  silly  for a  wise  End and to become the Jests of the People when they have been sure of an  Equi∣valent  This makes me afraid that these Waggs who speak of him with so much seeming Smartness are his Friends at the bot∣tom and I doubt if the Truth were known he has bribed them to be of his Party by let∣ting them now and then into the  Secrets  of  Masquerading  I MUST therefore take leave to look a little seriously into this Matter and I am afraid we  shall find That the  Count  has not so much a Design to make Persons of Quality with their Masques on look like the  Count  as to make the  Count  look like Persons of Quality with their Masques off  SEVERAL Clergymen some Bishops and other grave Personages have thought this a Matter of  Importance  enough to take Notice of as well as I but still it seems the  Count  is secretly resolved to have Wit enough to take no notice of any of us It must be allowed indeed That he is a Person of uncommon Parts to stand Proof against the Reasoning of so many Learned and Great Men without be∣ing in the least convinced or perswaded  BUT tho' this Power of resisting the Force of so many Eloquent Reasoners proves him a Prodigy in  Genius  and demonstrates him to have a world of Wit yet I would not have him forget that there is  some  Merit also in  Mo∣desty  If a Clergyman or a Bishop give their Opinions against him he thinks it sufficient to shrug his Shoulders and say grinning in his own Defence That he wonders they should make such a Bustle  for that a Domine a Cassock and a Mitre are the most common Masques in Fashion  This raises a loud Laugh and he comes off cleverly among the  young Fel∣lows  but he must not imagine to escape so with Persons of  my  Gravity  SEVERAL old Counsellors of State and at Law grave Physicians ancient Citizens and worthy Country Gentlemen just come up with  their Wives and Daughters to pay a Visit to the Town have all complained of him in their Turns and met with no better Quarter and notwithstanding all they can say to the contrary he has continued to carry on his Shew with very successful Raillery I expect that he will give  me  my Share of his Taunts among the rest but I have as little Taste for his  Wit  as I have for his  Sweetmeats  and to deal plainly with him I am in no such merry Vein as he may think when I tell him this unwelcome Truth That the Effects of  Mas∣querades  are very serious Things to Husbands and Fathers tho' they are Jokes to him and to  some  who are pleas'd to support him I must therefore desire him to lay aside his  Wit  and consider with a little  Wisdom  whether He may not be in Danger of falling hereafter in∣to the Clutches of a certain dark Enemy who is now his Friend in  Masquerade  and who will not be so easily eluded  HE may recollect if he pleases in one of the  Masquerades  a strange Spectacle like a Man whom he took at first to have a Vizard on but found upon a more narrow Exami∣nation to have exactly the Lineaments of his own Face the same Shape the same Air the same Gait the same Cloaths as himself and his very Wig of the same Colour and hang∣ing with the Foretop on one Tip of the Ear just like his own He may remember that this ghastly Mimick constantly attended him that whole Night did every thing that he did  said every thing he said and went to every Place where he went He may remember that he was struck with a terrible Panick and did not know what to think of this uninvited Companion of his but took him sometimes for a meer Mimick sometimes for a Spectre but at last he was convinced that it cou'd be no other than the  Devil  which a great many  wellmeaning  People believ'd was certainly the Truth and he very well knows that he and his Companion were easily mistaken for one another and that no body at last could well tell which was the  Count  and which was the  Devil  THO' the  Count  as the Phrase goes of him looks  bad  enough at the  best  he was remark'd to look much worse after this Vision than at any time before He was for many Days much dejected and profoundly pensive and melan∣choly and the terrible Apprehensions he was under caused a visible Increase of Wrinkles and furrow'd him into such Frightfulness that if ever he went to  take Coach  the  Horses  wou'd start and run away from himBut one Day above the rest when he was deep in the doleful Mood an airy young Fellow hear∣ing him say He intended to have no more  Masquerades  got out of him the  Secret  of his  Disorder  This Youth who was afraid that if that Diversion discontinued he should not suc∣ceed with a Lady for whose sake He was us'd to  hide  his  Face  that he might charm her with less Difficulty found an Expedient  to free the  Count  from his Fears and made him believe that it was a  Trick  of the  Prince de Monte Aspero  But the poor  Count  is im∣posed on if he gives Credit to that fictitious Story and might have been better advertis'd of the Truth if he had only had an Eye to the  ClubFoot  which stood out and  plainly shewed  his Companion as several innocent Spectators then present could testify Besides as a  Poet  who would preserve  Probability  could produce no Body proper to personate  Amphitryon  but  Jupiter  nor to mimick  Sofia  to the Life but  Mercury  so the  Count  if he reflects sufficiently upon his Person Parts and Qualities must of necessity be convinc'd in his Mind that since nothing  Human  could so exactly resemble him It  must  be at least a  Cacodaemon  UPON the whole if he lay this seriously to heart as I hope he will he will lay aside jesting become a true Penitent and take the good Time of  Lent  to consider Whether it will not be proper to quit all Thoughts of  Masquerading  for fear that Ghastly Figure that once took his Person  upon  him shou'd the next Time  take off  his Person  THE PLAIN DEALER N  o  III  Non est mortale quod optas  OVID  dicique beatus  Ante Obitum Nemo suprema{que} funera possit  MONDAY  March    SO weak is the  Frailty  of Human Nature that we can never be too  secure  tho'  arm'd  with the sublimest  Vertue  against the repeated  Attacks  of so many  Passions  as constantly be∣siege us and tho' the Garrison of the Mind may be never so well provided with all Means of Resistance the greatest of  Qualities Ver∣tues  and  Perfections  that our Nature is capa∣ble of attaining nevertheless  Treachery  with∣in  Force  or  Stratagem  from without may sur∣prize and defeat us An Example of which Infirmity the following  Story  will furnish the Reader and teach him of all Things to avoid what is call'd  Spiritual Pride  That Con∣tempt of another for not being so good as himself when he sees how in an Instant the greatest Piety and Religion may be chang'd by indulging only one dangerous  Passion  into the other Extream of  Wickedness  so that  we may apply to the Lubricity of Human Vertue what a wise Man of  Greece  said of  Happiness  That it can never be determin'd 'till Death  IN the following  Story  which is true as to Fact I shall be obliged to  disguise  some  Cir∣cumstances  of Time and Place to prevent the unfortunate Subject of this  Paper  or his  Fa∣mily  from being known so that it will be enough to inform the  Reader  That less than half an  Age  ago there liv'd a certain Gentle∣man of good  Birth  and  Fortune  who had polish'd and finish'd a Learned Education by the Improvement of a  Camp  and a  Court  in Both which He spent some Time when about the Thirtieth Year of his Age he thought fit to settle himself in the World and change his  Condition  by chusing a Partner of  Life  whose  Mind  was as well Adorn'd as her  Per∣son  was Engaging This happy  Couple  spent Five Years together in perfect Felicity the  Husband  with Reputation as well as Fortune and the  Wife  with Vertue not inferior to her Beauty  BUT what crown'd all their  Bliss  was That mutual  Esteem  they had contracted for one another in this time they had two or three  Children  who all dy'd in their Infancy And now it pleas'd Heaven to snatch from this  happy  Man the only Joy and Comfort of his  Life  his Charming Spouse died and left him not only an inconsolable but almost distracted  Widower  When the first Emotions  of  Grief  were over he retir'd from his own House to a little Farm in another  Country  where no  Object  should come in his  way  to revive in his Memory the  Loss  of his lament∣ed  Wife  Here he spent two Years which led him into the Thirty Eighth of his  Life  this Time he divided between his Studies and Devotion being  Religious  from his very In∣fancy Which natural  Piety  was now so much increas'd by his late Loss that at last he resolv∣ed to quit his Native Country and to retire into a  Convent  being born and bred in the Roman Catholick Communion  THIS Resolution was no sooner known to his Friends but they endeavour'd to  divert  it by all manner of  Persuasions  and  Arguments  by remonstrating to him That he was now in the Flower of his Age and blest with a plentiful  Fortune  to give him all the Comforts and Pleasures of  Life  that it would be un∣just thus to fling himself away not only to himself but his Friends and Family to whom he ow'd the Debt which he had contracted for Posterity to continue his Name They told him That he had paid all the Tribute to the Memory of his deceas'd Wife that the Laws of Honour Decency and the Obligations of a good Husband required that he was now at Liberty to make another Choice that one good Woman was not a Phoenix but that others of the same Species might be found to make him as happy as before  THESE Arguments tho' back'd with Rea∣son were all ineffectual he was deaf to every Remonstrance and pass'd over into  Flanders  where he plac'd himself at first as Pensioner in a Religious House and liv'd with the same Strictness that even the Rules of that Order requir'd from those who were under Vows of such Austerities nor did he receive more Edi∣fication from the Example of others than he gave by his own  AFTER a Life led for some time with the greatest Esteem and Reputation he com∣municated to the Superiors of the House his ardent Desire of being receiv'd into their Society The good Fathers tho' inwardly pleas'd with the Honour of having so excellent a Person in their Order did not receive his Proposal with that Chearfulness which he ex∣pected Their Prudence suggested to them that he was yet too young a Man to be real∣ly upon good Grounds disgusted with the World into the Love of which he lay under great Temptations of relapsing by reason of that large Fortune which could furnish Means of enjoying those Pleasures which he must now for ever abandon and the Loss of which if he should repent his Vows would make him as miserable as he propos'd to himself to to be happy They conjur'd him at the same time strictly to search his own Heart so as to be convinced that this Desire was an Im∣pulse and Call from God and not any Tem∣porary Disgust of the World which might  blow over and vanish in time He submit∣ted to this Proposal and in a little time assur'd them That it proceeded from the Di∣rections of that Providence to whose Service he had so strong and glorious a Passion to de∣dicate the rest of his Life Upon this the Society consented on Condition That he would undergo a double Noviciate that by the length of the Time they might be assur'd of his be∣ing confirm'd in those pious Resolutions  THIS he accepted and immediately sent over Powers into his own Country to convey and settle his Estate upon his Heir which was accordingly done and the Time of his Novice∣ship being expir'd he took his Vows and em∣braced that Life in which he propos'd to him∣self so much Heavenly Satisfaction  HE had not thus lived long in the Convent but his great Capacity and Learning render'd him too necessary to the Service of his Order to be kept at home by Command of his Su∣periors he went on several Commissions into other Countries where he executed the Orders which he had receiv'd with wonderful Ad∣dress and Fidelity at the same time acquiring an universal Reputation for his extraordinary Sanctity of Life  HIS Fortune settled him at last in  France  where he met with the same Esteem and Veneration as in other Countries being uni∣versally caress'd and admir'd At last his ardent Zeal for the Service of God inflam'd him with a passionate Desire of laying  down his Life in asserting the Cross of Christ nothing wou'd now satisfy his grow∣ing Fervour but to be sent on a Mission to convert Infidels to the Christian Faith in which Employ he had the holy Ambition to meet with a Crown of Martyrdom This pious In∣clination he communicated to the Superiors of his Order but was repulsed in his Request being told That Men of less Weight than he might be as serviceable in the Conversion of Savages that less Abilities than his were sufficient to instruct Nations so stupidly igno∣rant that his Presence was more necessary in  Europe  where they had so many Learned Ad∣versaries to combat  THIS Repulse not a little mortify'd the Zeal of the good Father whose Passion for Martyrdom was now more inflam'd by hearing That there was a new Mission of  French Jesuits  going over to  America  He apply'd himself to the  Bishop  of  Quebec  who was just upon his Departure for  Canada  this Prelate was so charm'd with the Zeal and Piety of the Man whose Character he had heard before that he enter'd into his Sentiments and made use of the Interest he had in the Court of  France  to get the Request of this New Apostle granted by Authority Thus Master of his Wishes he went over with the Bishop to  Canada  where he met with as much Veneration of his Piety Humility and all other Christian Vertues in  America  as he left behind him in  Europe  After some time of Refreshment he prepar'd  for his Apostolical Function and went with his Collegues among the most savage and cruel Nations of the  Indians  Some of his Com∣rades were murther'd by these People others died of the Hardships and Fatigues which they endured while our Missionary escap'd thro' the Goodness of his Constitution  IN this first Expedition he was several times in imminent Danger of Life having once the Knife over his Head to scalp him but Providence whose Secrets are unsearchable preserv'd him and would not vouchsafe that Honour which he so passionately desir'd of dying a Martyr In this first Attempt he suc∣ceeded so far as to vanquish the Obstinacy and Ignorance of Twentytwo  Indian  Men and Women whom he baptiz'd and brought with him to  Quebec  which Town he enter'd tri∣umphantly with his Converts The Reader may guess at the Veneration paid him by the People who look'd on him as a Saint and Apo∣stle and prest near to touch and kiss his very Garments The Winter Months he was oblig'd to spend his Time at  Quebec  it being impos∣sible to preserve Life in so cold a Country without the Cover of Houses against the Incle∣mency of the Air The SummerSeasons were taken up entirely by the Labours of his Mis∣sion in which he had wonderful Success the third Winter at which time he approach'd the th Year of his Age The Governour who had a profound Respect for him invited the good Missioner to come and reside at his House  with a Request to instruct his Daughter who desired to learn Languages and Mathematicks The good Father chearfully undertook his New Province and very assiduously attended his young Pupil the Pregnancy of whose Parts made his Pains the more agreeable This Lady was about Eighteen Years old with a Person equal to the Beauties of her Mind and all the Vivacity so natural to her Country The Preceptor had not often attended his fair Scho∣lar but he found those Emotions in his Heart which in a little time shipwreck'd his Ver∣tue he fell desperately in Love and thro' the Eyes suck'd in that Poyson which now taint∣ed a Soul that so much Vertue had long and constantly defended before LOVE that in∣vincible Tyrant entirely subdued and added the Heart of this once Holy Man to his other Triumphs In order to make himself the more agreeable he cut off his Beard and now put on Linnen next his Skin which he had not worn for some Years the more to in∣dulge his Mortification tho' he was not oblig'd to that Austerity by the Rules of his Order That Devotion which had flam'd so long in his Heart towards God Almighty was now turn'd into Adoration of one of his Creatures LOVE converting all others Passions into itself as the Plague does all other Distempers  IN short he managed his Amours with that Address That at last he triumph'd and gra∣tify'd his Criminal Desires the Fruits of which soon appear'd the young Damsel was with  Child which flung the Lovers into the last Confusion and Distress There was no Re∣medy but one which was To fly accord∣ingly one Night the Summer now advancing so as to permit them to lie in the Woods they got over the Ramparts and fled to the  Indians  among whom he had a great Interest and who now receiv'd them with open Arms As he had seen some Campaigns in his Youth and understood Fortification and the Mathe∣matical Part of War he began to Train and Discipline the Savages whom he persuaded to revolt against the  French  In the mean while the Governour overwhelm'd with Grief for this terrible Misfortune in his Family sent out several small Parties to bring them back but these were defeated by the Superiority of Num∣bers upon which the Governour march'd with the whole Garrison and all the Fighting Men he could muster the Lovers animated and en∣courag'd the Savages whom they brought in great Numbers to oppose the Enemy the little Armies came in sight and while the Two Unfortunate Lovers stood close to one another she with an  Indian  Quiver at her Back and Bow in her Hand the first Fire from the  French  laid them both on the Ground Such was the sad Catastrophe of this unhappy Man whose Piety and good Life for so many Years could not prevent his Falling at last so Memorable an Example of  The Imbecility of all Human Ac∣complishments  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Tigris agit rabidâ cum tigride pacem  Perpetuam saevis inter se convenit Ursis  JUV  FRIDAY  April    GAMING  and  Stockjobbing  come to Day under my Observation The first methinks needs no Aggravation of its Guilt in order to extinguish it since it may so tru∣ly be said That there is nothing  Honourable  that it does not aim to make  Vile  nothing  Great  and  Magnificent  that it does not reduce to look  Little  and  Despicable  HOW would the deceased  Bucharis  have been able to leap down from behind the Chariot of a departed Lord and step into a finer of his own if he had wanted the  happy  Turn of obliging  unlucky  Gentlemen to live in a more uncomfortable State than even his Compani∣ons before himself became a Gentleman What must the great  Cartaerarius  think when he prances along the Pavements upon a Par with the Prime Nobility and sees a Wretch walk the Streets halfstarv'd with Cold and Hunger dress'd in  Sagathie  in the Depth of  Winter whom he knew to have been his Su∣perior in Wealth and Magnificence till  he  reduc'd him to this  Disparity  Can my Rea∣ders imagine That  Cartaerarius  must not lose the Jollity of his Heart for a Moment at so mortifying a Prospect or Do they think he can be Brute enough to enjoy himself upon the Reflection of his different Fortune and of the Tricks he had play'd in his Life and the  Num∣bers  he had made as wretched as the  Object  I have mentioned  THIS is a strange and melancholy  Fate  a Box and Dice heartily stamp'd upon a Table here in  London  shall have a more powerful Effect on the Walls of a strongbuilt Castle in the  Country  than the firing of Twenty  Mor∣ta  s  against it could have had on the Spot and shall force the Possessor to surrender it  at Dis∣cretion  with all the Territories round about it to one who is  innocently  called a  fair Enemy  and who attacks it in  Play  only  IT is still more strange That a Custom which has been known to have brought such uncom∣mon Calamities upon the greatest and richest Men should at last become common among the common People themselves And yet this was lately the Case Tradesmen and Sharpers of a Lower Rank committed the like Hosti∣lities and Shops were shut up  by way of Gaming  I know one  Wise Man  an  Apothecary  who ne∣glected his  Business  to become  Rich  and has been seen to lose more Money by shaking his Elbow over a  GamingTable  in three Hours than he  could recover by brandishing his Arm over a  Mortar  in three times as many Months  I AM the more slack in my Remarks and throw together only a few loose Hints against this vicious Habit because a more effectual Way has been lately taken to check its Progress And if People of Fashion did not think them∣selves above the Benefit of those Laws which vulgar Persons are cautious of transgressing for fear of being treated as Cheats and Im∣postors this Discourse would be render'd use∣less The Nature of Imposture is no other∣wise alter'd by being the Fact of a Person of Distinction but by its becoming more highly Criminal Out of Persons of Fashion and Estate are generally chosen those who are obliged to watch over the publick Welfare And can they guard Property in publick Life who lay Snares to entrap it in a private Capacity No Man should be allow'd to appear in an Assem∣bly of  Business  who has made himself a  Member  among the Surrounders of a  Hazard Table  There have been of late but  Two  Gamesters that stepp'd high enough to have any Rule in publick Affairs entrusted to their Management  Exlex  and the young  Montanus  these tho' otherwise Men of signal Capacities and many worthy Qualifications could not resist their Natural Propensity and thereby infus'd into two Kingdoms such an universal Spirit of  Avarice  and  Gaming  by strange Schemes 'till then unheardof as must if continued have  soon accomplish'd the Ruin which they threaten'd at their first Appearance  AS to  Gaming  in lower Life the Justices of the Peace have acted with such commendable Vigilance That they have scarce left me a known Sharper in the Town to exercise the Edge of my Satire upon Most of them have I believe by this time taken to the more  ho∣nourable  way of Robbing with a  Pistol  and  Brace of Balls  in it which is much less  dangerous  to the  Offended  and less  safe  to the  Offender  than a  Box  with a  Pair of Dice  in it Others have gone in Gangs like Footpads and while one knock'd down the Passenger the other rifled him which is only a kind of  Emblem  of their Play called  Two poll One  Thus I believe that if a strict Scrutiny were made into the Num∣bers that are left of the  Fraternity  we should find that since the happy Dissolution of that Knot most of the loose ones have been swept away by his Majesty's industrious Subject Mr  Jonathan Forward  RearAdmiral of the  City Transports  BUT there is a Species of more mischie∣vous  Gamesters  remaining still among us who ought methinks to have had free Passage in some of that Great  Pilot  's VesselsI mean the present  Fraternity  of  Stockjobbers  THIS  Brotherhood  who play their Game upon the Hopes and Fears of other People make use of  cant  Names as the  Gamesters  did and with just the same Propriety The  Game∣sters  called their Instruments of Mischief by the  Denomination of  Squibs  and  Puffs  and the  Stockjobbers  have their  Bulls  and  Bears  nor were  those  half so formidable in  CoventGarden  as  these  are about the  RoyalExchange  in  Corn∣hill  A  Bear  is a Beast of Prey who not having perhaps a Morsel in the World appears with the Pretence of a whole  Paw full  of  Stock  which he agrees to deliver on a Day But if  Stock  rises he must as the Phrase is  Shew his Tail  that is he must  Run away  A  Bull  is just the Reverse of this He is as Pennyless as his Brother Beast but roars and bellows for  Stock  and  Devours  all that is offer'd him and if at the Time when it is to be paid for it happens to fall then he too must  Run off  as the  Bear  did  NUMBERS of honest Tradesmen are delu∣ded by these  odd Beasts  and kept warm with imaginary  Hopes  of turning their Money better and faster upon  Stocks  than in Business And where the Unskilful are drawn in to try their Fortunes this way their Money becomes a  Sa∣crifice  to the  Jobbers  and themselves  Bankrupts  to the  Publick Bulls  and  Bears  as opposite as they are in their Natures agree very well together and sometimes personate one another to draw in an honest Citizen and if he once gets between  both  by that Time the  Stocks  have had a few Variations to and fro he is sure by their  tossing  him from one to t'other to be  worried  out of his Senses  MY Friend the  Alderman  who has some∣times a way of Jesting peculiar to himself says That when he has been running over the  Ad∣vertisements  relating to Bankrupts in our  Ga∣zettes  he would frequently make Marks on the Margin denoting Where such a  brokenhearted  Butcher has been forced to shut up his Stall upon being Gored by the  Horn  of a  Bull  and where the  Paw  of a  Bear  has pulled a rich LinnenDraper by the Head and Ears over his Counter I warrant you my old Friend will he often say for he is apt to dwell upon old  Jokes  when the WatchTower of  Barbi∣can  was standing the sharpest Eye of any Man that stood in it could never perceive round this whole City one such voracious Ani∣mal threatning Ruin to the Inhabitants as the Modern  Bulls  and  Bears  are  IT is certain That the  Alderman  's  Jest  was true in  Earnest  For our wise Ancestors made wholsome Laws for extirpating all wild and mischievous Beasts out of the Land and set a Price upon their Heads It must be therefore very wrong in such a Populous Town as this to permit  Bulls  and unmuzzled  Bears  to have their Stalls and Dens about  ExchangeAlley  where they have Opportunity to run out and destroy unwary Citizens Besides the  Alder∣man  told me as a Remark of his Wife That under Boast of the vast  Stocks  they deal for they tempt the yielding Hearts of many a rich Citizen's Daughter and pin themselves on Fa∣milies to be kept without a Groat and some∣times  take a  Bite  of the young Lady in that Part they like best and then run away with∣out  coming  to  account  for it She says That Mr  Honeyman  a Sugar Baker has Two Cubs upon his Daughter's hands by a  Bear  that has left the  Alley  and that Mr  Simple  's Favourite Child is upon the Point of being delivered of a Calf begot by a silly awkward  Bull  that  Burst  himself by  swallowing Stock  beyond the Power of his natural  Digestion  THESE are Things not to be tolerated in any Civil Government whatsoever for they manifestly tend to the Ruin of Commerce and at this rate it will come to pass in the course of a few Years That while  Russia  is polishing its rough Inhabitants into the finer Resemblance of  Englishmen  the Politeness of  Britain  will be transformed into the Barbarity of  Russia  and the greatest Part of this Metropolis will be over∣run with an unheardof Generation of  Savages  and  Monsters  It is therefore my serious Opi∣nion That the Practice shou'd be put down and that for the Quiet and Safety of  sober Citizens  every  Bull  and  Bear  of them all should be first driven out of the City by the way of  Newgate  and then transported out of the Kingdom  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Militat omnis amans habet sua Castra  Cupido  OVID  MONDAY  April    THE LOVE of our  Country  when it is understood as Great Spirits consider  it  is the most  Noble  among those  Vertues  which grace and elevate Human Nature But in the  General Idea  which Men form when they speak of this publick  Duty  it is a mean and selfish  Frailty  A poor Contraction of Soul which would call in our Beneficence from Mankind our common Brotherhood and con∣fine it with a scandalous Frugality of Affecti∣on to the  Land  which we were  born  in for the same ridiculous Reason which made the  Ape  in the  Fable  the  First  that produced her young Ones when a Decree had been publish∣ed That the most  Beautiful  among the  Beasts  should succeed to the  Government  FEW Men I am afraid have  any  Nobler Motive than this  Love  of themselves for the  Love  they bear their  Country  But the Partia∣lity of a true Patriot must be justify'd by his  Care of the Publick Honour He must contri∣bute to the General Interest with the Loss of his particular  Ease  and to the Hazard of his private  Safety  The same impatient  Beat  with which the Soul conscious of Immortality presses forward to Futurity and inspires a Se∣cret Pleasure in our Hope of Fame  Hereafter  tho' we are sure we shall be  Dust  and have no Ear for those Praises which we charm our our selves in  Death  with but the Prospect and faint Image ofThe same Noble Source has the Spirit of true  Patriotism  It teaches a wise Man to  Love  his  Country Like  his Offspring not meerly as they are  His  but for the Natural Vertues which he observes in them and which he has taken Delight to to cherish and urge forward for the Orna∣ment of Posterity  THE  Prejudices  of our  Minds  and the dif∣ferent  Interests  we are led by make us very unqualified Judges of the State of this Vertue with Regard to the Times we live in And the same Passions have always produc'd the same Effects in the  Historians  of former Ages But there are some Instances so strongly De∣monstrative in their Nature That  Partiality  can add no  Beauty  by the Arts of Describing nor can  Envy  discolour them by false Lights or misplacing  DEEP Enquirers into Nature have recom∣mended it as a way to judge soundly of Mens good or evil Tendency by observing what Effect is produc'd in their Passions upon Re∣lation  of some Amiable Example of Human Excellence if such a Trial is just I should wish to avoid the Society of that Man who could reflect on the following Story without unusual Emotions in Honour of the  Noble Roman  to whose  true  Sense of Publick Spirit we owe it  IN that part of the  Punick  War when  Fa∣bius Maximus  commanded the Forces of  Italy  against  Hannibal  certain Officers of the  Roman  Army were taken Prisoners by the Enemy  Fabius  was well acquainted with the Skill and Courage of these Men and resolv'd not to lose them He therefore treated with the  Car∣thaginians  and agreed upon their Ransom at a very high Sum for Payment of which by a Day appointed he engag'd the Honour of the  Roman Senate  But the  Senate  instead of sending him the Money refused to ratify the Agreement  Fabius  receiv'd the News with more  Grief  than  Indignation  and giving strict Orders for concealing it from his Army dispatch'd his Son to  Rome  with all Secrecy and Expedition to make Sale of his  Own Paternal Estate  and to return to him with the  Money  which as soon he receiv'd he sent it to  Hannibal  as from the  Senate    For I had rather  said he  It should be reported of the  Ro∣mans  That they have a  General  without  Land  than a  Senate  without  Humanity  OUR  Clergyman  whom we delight to con∣sider as a  Blessing  to the  Assembly  because his  Life  is a silent Enforcer of his  Doctrine  was  expatiating the other Day on the  Grace  and  Grandeur  of this  Action  and had fix'd us in the most satisfied and respectful Attention when he was broke in upon by the  Coquet  with the following Relation which she assur'd us was Matter of Fact and happen'd very lately  And it contains  added she  so ex∣alted an Instance of refin'd and generous  Love  That if ever I find a Man who would be  Mine  upon such Terms I shall  Marry  and bid Defiance to the Sound of the Word  Matron  COURTHOPE  was the Son of an  English  Merchant who had liv'd long in the  Canary Islands  he had been sent young to  London  for the Advantage of his Education and while there fell in  Love  with  Bellaria  the only Daughter of a Gentleman of a good Family and Estate who had promis'd this Lady to a distant Relation of his Name But she had an Aversion for his Person and made open Profession of a Passion for young  Courthope  which the Father was so far from approving that being provok'd by her Firmness he command∣ed her under Penalty of his Hatred and his Curse never more to converse with him and confin'd her from that time forward to pre∣vent even the Possibility of it  Bellaria  not∣withstanding this Restraint found means to escape and dressing her self in Boy's Cloaths imbark'd with  Courthope  on a  Spanish  Ship that was bound for the  Canaries  where he assur'd her they would be welcome to a  Fa∣ther  whose gentle Nature knew nothing of  that  Rigour  which from her Infancy she had been oppress'd by They were taken in this Voyage by a  Moorish  Vessel belonging to the Rovers of  Sallee  And 'tis easier to conceive than express the Affliction the Despair the Astonishment of  Courthope  fallen at once from a Prospect of the sweetest and most live∣ly Joy to the Depth of consummate Misery He saw  Her  now the Companion of his  Sla∣very  who had wish'd and ventur'd so much to make  Him  Partner of her  Affluence  and he suffer'd more than Death every time that his Eyes all swimming in Tears stole a Glance at his  Bellaria  whom he durst not distinguish by any Marks of Respect or Service for fear of pointing out her  Sex  to the Brutes who were their Masters  BUT what aggravated his Sorrow to the most piercing Extremity was an Information he receiv'd from a Native of the  Canaries  whom he found a Slave at  Sallee  That his Fa∣ther was newly dead and that all his Effects had been seiz'd by the  Spaniards  on Occasion of some Criminal Correspondencies which he had unwarily been drawn into  THEY pass'd about a Week with the rest of their Ship's Company in a publick Dun∣geon of the City where they were to expect the killing Summons which must expose them in a  Market  to be sold and torn for ever from the Enjoyment of that mutual Comfort which was now the only Thought that could sup∣port 'em in their Wretchedness The Moon  one Night shone clearly thro' the Grates of the Prison Windows and  Courthope  while the rest were asleep hung in melancholy Trans∣port over the Bosom of  Bellaria  who started in broken Slumbers and fill'd his Soul with sad Reflections He took Notice of a rugged Stone which rose pointed thro' the Earth and imagining it might hurt her remov'd it with much Difficulty and had no sooner drawn it out but he discover'd an old Piece of Wool∣len Cloth which had formerly been hidden under it in which were Sixty  Moidores  Two  Gold Rings  and a  Writing  which he perceiv'd to have been  French  but now defac'd and not legible  HE approach'd  Bellaria  's Ear and awak'd her in all the Ecstacy of a Man who consider'd himself as distinguished by  Providence  He whisper'd his new Hopes of an immediate Redemption and found Means soon after by Aid of an honest  Jew  a Man of much Charity who visited the Slaves every Morning to be carried to the  Alcaid  and trusting his Gold with the  Jew  propos'd to ransom  Himself  and  Bellaria  whom he called his Brother But the Conflict of his Passions had so visible an Effect in his Looks and his Earnestness that the  Alcaid  took Advantage from what he observed and insisted on the whole Sum for the Liberty of  One  only which was offered him for  Both  He bid him name at his Choice either his Brother or himself but advised him to lose no Time for an  English  Sloop was ready  to sail out of the Harbour with ransom'd Captives on Board and would carry him to  Gibraltar  where his Countrymen were in Gar∣risonHe added too That all the  Chri∣stian Slaves  in  Sallee  were to set out the next Morning for  Mequinez  to work on some New Buildings of the Emperor of  Morocco  Courthope  trembled with Jealousy and a Thousand different Fears at the distracting Imagination of  Bellaria  in the Eye and Power of such a TyrantHe went out with the  Jew  and took a sudden Resolution  ABOUT Noon the same Day the  Jew  re∣turned to the Prison and carried with him an Order for the Dismission of  Bellaria  who en∣quiring after  Courthope  was told He went be∣fore to prepare Things for her Reception on Board the Vessel they were to embark in and had given him Orders to conduct her thither immediately Never was any Order obey'd with so much Transport the  Jew  hir'd a Boat and attending her to the Ship return'd abrupt∣ly to the Town without taking Leave of herShe was led into the Cabbin where ex∣pecting to find her Lover she was receiv'd by the Master of the Vessel with whom the  Jew  had been before and who deliver'd her a Let∣ter which she open'd with trembling Hands and read in it what follows  HOW miserable should I have been my  dear  my  lost Bellaria  if Heaven had not enabled me to redeem  you  from Mi∣sery  The Money which I found in the Dungeon was too little to save us  both  al∣low  me  therefore the Honour to have re∣stor'd  you  to that Liberty which you lost for having  pitied  me I am a Wretch whose IllFortune neither your  Sex  nor your  Limbs  were fram'd to be Partakers ofIf I am worthy of  Bellaria  I shall  see  her  again  If she blesses me with her  Prayers  I cannot  fail  to be  Fortunate  And if she  wishes  to live without me I shall die  happiest  in  Ab∣sence  Angels Guide  you  to your Father If he has  lov'd  he will forgive me and per∣mit a Sigh now and then to the Memory of poor  COURTHOPE  SHE flew skrieking upon the Deck as soon as she had read this dreadful this insup∣portable Letter but saw with as much Di∣stinction as her Tears would permit her that the Ship was under Sail and all she wish'd to live for left in Slavery behind Her  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Quae te  Ter purelecto poterunt recreare Libello  HOR  FRIDAY  April    THOUGH  GoodBreeding  and  Politeness  are generally thought the  same  they are  Qualities  very  different Politeness  is the  In∣fluence  of a  Natural Refinement GoodBreeding  the  Form  of an  Artificial Civility  The  Last  but  Restrains  us from  giving Offence  the  First Impowers  us to  give Pleasure Politeness  is the happy Mixture of  Greatness  with  Benignity  'Tis a  Sunshine  from the  Soul  on the  Looks Words  and  Actions GoodBreeding  is often a  Surface  without  Depth  and like the Painter's gay Colours on dark Primings spreads a  Gloss  over the  Outside  even of  Vices  and  Mean∣spiritedness  Whereas  Politeness  like the  Cry∣stal  is  transparent  as well as  shiny  and always appears lovelier the fuller  Light  it is plac'd in  I INTENDED to have adapted to this  seri∣ous Introduction  a very  sober Dissertation  which many of my Gentle  Readers  might no  doubt have mistaken for a  Dull  One But I shall substitute in its Place a most  extraordinary Essay  of the  Epistolary  Kind which will serve for the  same  Purpose It brings me the  uncom∣mon  Case of a faithful though unfavour'd  Lover  whose  GoodBreeding  without  Politeness  has  lost  him a Mistress by an odd Kind of  Civility  which he made use of for  engaging  her  I NEED not inform my  Readers  That this Letter is an  Original  They will discover  na∣tural Graces  in it which are  inimitably Genuine  These for the  PlainDealer  at Mr  Roberts  's in  WarwickLane  With Care and Speed Deliver  Mr  PlainDealer  SIR  ALL Yours yet publish'd have regular∣ly receiv'd and note their Contents I thought it proper to let you know That al∣though I am a  Cooper  I lov'd her as well as her  finical TurkeyMerchant  But I forgot to let you know first That the needful of this Letter is That she that I mean is a pretty young Woman worth a Brace and a half of  Thousands  But that makes nothing to the Story I had  Money enough  for that Matter and tho' I was no powder'd  fine Fellow  with a finical white Wig yet I valued and esteemed her as if I had been the Mother that bore her And I should have been glad when Heaven saw fit to have had her in  her  Smock  And so  mayhap  now I think on't wou'd her Beau too but I mean in an  honest way  only But what matters that  Fair and False  was an old Saying in its Time And if I had stuck close to my Calling and valued her no more than the Paring of my Nails I had been a better Man for it by some  Hundreds  But there is no setting  Old Heads  upon  Young Shoulders  Every Body knows I am no  Bragster  and tho' I say it that should not I could have lov'd the very Ground that she  went  upon And very un∣happy she has made me that's certain where∣by I hope somebody that is higher than she will remember her for it in the  Last Day  for then all  Secrets  will be  laid open  I can't for my Life imagine what possesses me but I shall begin to hate  my ownself  shortly if it was in Nature to be possible because when∣ever she comes into my Head I am ready to  cry  at the Thoughts of her  NOW you must know she had told a Friend of mine that  wish'd  me to her not once nor twice but that very Day that he was leading her Home from  Draper  's  Gardens  That she thought as how no Man could fall in Love with a  RedHair'd Woman  But to see how strangely Mistakes will come about this was all but her own Fancy for I never once thought of it nor was never the Man that had ever concern'd my self with any Thing she had about her So because I woud'n't be  uncivil  I made a great Supper  and invited an old Aunt of mine that she  know'd  and half a score young Women be∣sides herself to take Part of it for it  burnt  in my Mind strangely In the middle of the Supper I watch'd my Time to drink to her and told her before 'em all That she might be sure by my having no Body to Supper but  Folks with Red Hair  as how I shou'dn't like her a  Crum  the worse for  That  For I didn't care a Pin for that mat∣ter if she was as  red  as a  Fox  all over To be sure she look'd all Night after it as the  Devil lookt over Lincoln  And when I went the Afternoon after to  make Love  to her as I us'd to do nothing vex'd me but her sending me down word by that pert Gossip Mrs  Briget  that I am sure has had of me at Times in Presents besides Good Words to the Value of  Five Pieces  and yet she bid  Her forsooth  to go and tell me That I had no need for giving my self any more Trouble to come there for her Mistress would have nothing to say to a  Hoopdriver  NOW I knowing as how we are com∣manded to  forgive  all our  Enemies  wou'dn't do her  no Harm  for the World And so hoping you will print this  only  to  expose  her concludes the needful at present from  Your Real Friend G B  PS  Her Hair was not  Golden  Locks but that  hot  Sort of  Red  which most Folks call  Carrots  As I shall borrow from my  Correspondents  the Entire Entertainment of this Day here follows an

you are in the Right too in  one  Thing that relates to your  Paper  which is your Publishing it on  Fridays  For  FishDays  and  Fasts  prepare People for Mortification  IF you needs must be

BEING the other Day in a large Com∣pany at a Gentleman's House in  CoventGarden  I was highly delighted to hear a young beautiful  Lady  acknowledge that Tears flow'd from her Eyes upon reading of the Story of  Courthope  She who had the  Virtue  to be so  Elegantly moved  by his  Distress  will relish an Account of his better Fortune which she may hereafter expect to be  Entertained  with But when she added  That she had been a  Coquette  too long and if ever it should be her Fate to meet with a Suitor of  Courthope  's  Desert  she would let him  lose  no Time for Fear of Accidents  when I perceived she made this  frank  Confession not only with her  Lips  but from her  Heart  I confess I began to conceive Hopes of knowing very speedily  That some  visible Fruits  would arise from these my  Labours  I WAS therefore a little concern'd when I found my self interrupted by a young  Wag  who was pleased to pass Pertness upon the Company for  Jesting  'That PLAIN DEALER  said he  is  a wellmeaning Writer  but he does not strike out a Meaning  cleverly  This is one of the best Stories I have read upon the Subject of  Love  only there is not one  DoubleMeaning  through the Whole and that makes it  Insipid  He has been  generally  hitherto a perfect Inhabitant of his  BluntHall  which seems to be rather the  Seat  of his  Understanding  than of his  Person  But since the  Ladies like  him I will endeavour to be of  Their  Mind and especially be∣cause he tells us he is an  Old Batchelor  as well as a PLAIN DEALER and we must have some  Humour  struck  out of  him when he comes to  act  that Character  I GUESS'D what the young  Malapert  would be at by the Word  Humour  and I found I was not deceiv'd when he pulled out of his Pocket a little Scrap of Poetry intitled  An Epistle from Mrs  Robinson  to  Senesinoin which he peremptorily swore  There was a great deal of  Turn Life  and  Spirit  IT is certain He shewed some  Spirit  in reading it and proved himself a  Master  of  Hu∣mour  for he went  boldly  and  undauntedly  thro' it and would never observe that every  fresh Line  excited  fresh Blushes  in the  Faces  of all the  Fair  and  Modest  Part of the Assembly  I TAKE this  Opportunity  of Informing that young Spark and all others of the same  Class  are desired to take  Notice  of it That he is greatly mistaken if he expects any such Hu∣mour from me notwithstanding his  irreverent  way of talking of his  Elders  and throwing over  my  Shoulder a General Sneer upon all the  Old Batchelors  in  GreatBritain  MY  Province  must be  Tedious  before it can grow  Pleasant  I must first remove  Folly  before I can make Room for  Wit  for it is by  clear∣ing  their way through the Rubbish of  Ab∣surdity  that Men take the  first Steps  to  Wis∣dom  IF according to the  Maxim  in the Forehead of my  Paper  it was my immediate Office to  Teach  that young Spark  better  Things which I had then a great Inclination to  Do  only for Fear of  discovering  my self I would begin by  Weeding  out of his Mind that  rank  Conceit which he entertains of his Parts and shewing him that there is no  true Humour  in  Lewdness  nor  true Wit  in a  Double Entendre  HOW  different  was the  Principle  of  Waller  That Excellent Writer as I have heard my old Friend Mr  Dryden  relate publickly at  Will  's in his Commendation used to say  That he would  raze  any  Line  out of his  Poems  which did not  imply  some  Motive  to  Virtue This is a Saying that ought to be  Memorable  among our  Poets  it carries with it the  Energy  of  Good Sense  as well as  Virtue  FOR my own Share I declare I would rather  Propagate  one such  Maxim  with good Effect amongst the Writers of the present Age than be the  Head  of those  Writers  my∣self and the Author of  better  Verses than  Waller  's  THEY who believe this to be my real Sen∣timent may guess how extreamly delighted I must have been with the following  Answer  which a young Lady has given to the  Affront  and  Outrage  offered to the whole  Sex  by one who personates  Senesino  in that  scandalous  Epistle  An  ANSWER  from Mrs  ROBINSON  to  SENESINO  FROM thy  Loose  Lines I turn my Eyes away  Nor know o'erspread with  Blushes  what to say  The Modest  MUSES  wounded by thy Strain  For  Me  and for  Themselves  do thus complain  O  Thou  our Country's  Folly  and  Expence  Dull Foe to  Tragedy  and  GODlike Sense  Too long  mean mercenary  Shade too long  Hast thou these ISLES  Inchanted  with thy  Song  Musick  's soft  GOD Unbinds  the Charm he  rais'd  He  blest

Grace  will seek a  Chaster  Tongue  No more the  Lover  shall thy Song  Repeat  No more the  FAIR ONE  sigh  'Tis wondrous sweet  Oh Guilty  Senesino  Thou  no  more  Shalt  bravo bravo  hearor  loud Encore  The  Loose  and  Dull  shall  All  thy Audience be  The  Chaste  and  Witty  shall  Resent  for Me  All  unattended  shall thy  awkward  Form  To sad  uncrowded  Scenes or  whine  or  storm  Thy wretched  Ha  shall  unapplauded  grow  And  illplac'd  Bays fall  with'ring  from thy Brow  Know Songster  Julius GODlike  Chief disdains  Thy  shrill unnatural ungraceful  Strains  With Rage

of  mean delusive  Sound  When I shall see thy Temples all unbound  And  Those  that Heroes  Act  like Heroes  Crown'd  Thou to thy famish'd  Italy  shalt go  And Rival  Faustus  to the  Shades  Below  THE  Business  of the  following  is of a  Nature  very  surprizing  To say  Truth  I was startled at it It does not  directly  indeed come to me from the  Devil  But it was sent me from a  Deputy  of  his  who Professes the  Black Art  and stiles himself  Doctor Faustus  He dates his Letter  From the  Theatre  in  LincolnsInnFieldsand would  pass  upon me for a  Player  or a  Tumbler  or  Zany  under the  Disguise  of a Magician But I beg his Pardon for  That  I am seldom  deceiv'd  so easily I am almost persuaded It is an  Agile  Evil Spirit  that walks and does Mischief by CandleLight and assumes  enticing Shapes  to draw in the  Unwary  and deprive People of their  Wits  But if he be  really  Flesh and Blood I am at a Loss what to think of him only his  Assurance  seems considerable since he appears by his Letter to belong to One of our  Theatres  that he should imagine me to be Novice enough to believe he could be a  Conjurer  FAUSTUS  the  MAGICIAN  To the  PLAIN DEALER  Greeting  FORASMUCH as I Reverence your Name and your Purpose I decline the Revenge which by Aid of my  Art  I might return for my Injuries and content my self by your Means to expose an  Impostor  HAVING fixed my Place of Residence on my Arrival in this famous City at the  Theatre  by  Lincoln  's  Inn  for the  Publick Dis∣play  of  Qualities  which  Distinguish  the Sons of  Magick  I heard with a Due Mixture of  Contempt  and  Displeasure  that the Rumour of my Purpose had encourag'd  another Theatre  to  disguise  under the  Venerable  Character of  Faustus  a profess'd Lover of  Levity  and  endeavour  in Spite of Nature to give him the  Weight  of a  Wizard  BUT being satisfied in the  Consciousness  of my  own  Superiority I have  overlook'd  and  neglected  him 'till embolden'd by  Success  he has  dar'd  now at last to  publish  his  List  of  Fooleries  with a pertinacious  Pretence  to something not unlike  Comparison  I am therefore determin'd immediately to make him  leap  out of my Gown and confess him∣self  No Doctor  IN that Catalogue of  Tricks  most illiberal Appellation he makes use of these  strange  Words  A  Usurer  comes in and brings a MoneyBag to the  Doctor  for which he offers his Note but the  Usurer  entirely con∣temns the Proposal and will have the  Doctor'  s  Leg  instead of Security for the Money The  Doctor  endeavours to dissuade him from this Demand and offers him his Head in Exchange of the  Leg  he wanted  I PASS over the  unmagical Absurdity  of a  Necromancer  's wanting Money or That a  Usurer  who would rather have parted with his  own  Leg to save a Bag of Money should be so whimsical to surrender  it  in Exchange for  Another  's I leave such  Remarks  to the  Trite  Essays of  Criticks  not descending my self to the  Insignificance  of being  Witty  But what I would convey to the Knowledge of your  Readers  is The  Necessity  which my  Charms  have laid this  Boaster  under to  Ex∣pose  and  Discover  himself in the very  Act  of his  Imposture  FOR who does not know That had he been the  true Faustus  his  Brains  must have had their Situation in his  Head  His  Head  therefore he would have preferr'd to all his  inferior  Members But the  Seat  of his Un∣derstanding  having been  plac'd  by his  Pro∣fession  at the  Bottom  of his Body I com∣mission'd a  Familiar  to perplex his Appre∣hension who by convincing him of how little Worth his  Head  was in comparison with his  Heels  drew him under such a Terror that he continually cries out to those who come for his Catalogue  The  Devil  is in good Earnest in the  Conjurer  of  Lincoln'sInn  but I am only a  DancingMaster  YOU shall prosper in PLAINDEALING if you Publish this  Letter  and have Faith in  FAUSTUS  the  ENCHANTER  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Nos duo turba sumus  OVID  FRIDAY  April    THERE is a  Liveliness  and Race of  Spirit  which we commonly call  Wit  but it is the  Effect  of  Natural Accident  and depends like a  Machine  upon  Order  and  Parts  It is only the  Result  of a  Mixture  of  different Humours  and of Animal Spirits  finer  and more  delicately  agitated than ordi∣nary which  imprint  in their Passage a  quick  and  lively  Sense of Images and animate by that Impression the  Visage Voice  and  Deport∣ment  IT is merely by this Quickness and Heat of their  Imagination  that witty Men surprize us A smart and sprightly  Rhetorick  A hu∣morous Turn of  Phrase  A frank Vivacity of  Mien  with a  modish Affectation  of peculiar  Looks  and  Gesture  make the  Merit  of their  Character  But these Men want for the most Part both  Strength  of  Mind  and  Penetration  Their  Imaginations  are  thin  and  delicate  and play  lightly  on the  Skirts  of  Objects  But they are too  weak  for solid  Reasoning  and in any Thing  abstracted  and  above  the  Pitch  of the  Senses  they are miserably  Impotent  and grow presently  weary  THEY are the  Ladies Favourites  however by a Kind of  Sympathy  or  Resemblance  For  Women  being naturally of feeble  Constitutions  have their Brains of soft Consistence with  Fibres fine  and  slender apt  and  easy  to be mov'd by the  weakest  Agitations They are  subject  therefore to their  Senses  and wanting  Force  to strike  deeper  set up for Judges of  Modes  and  Fashions  and relish nothing but what contributes to their  Pleasure  or their  Ornament  They have fix'd the Standard of  Wit  by certain  Rules  of this  Tendency  and  find nothing so  difficult  as to believe a Man can  want  it who has such  Charms  for  their  Entertainment  NED VOLATILE a Member of our  Assem∣bly  at the  Widow  's is a  Foreman  of this  Species  With a great Extent of  Good Nature  he ap∣pears  Void  of  any  his Facility to  jest  and  rally  transports him beyond  Decency  to  illustrate  Objects or  debase  'em and without regard to  Ceremony Merit  or  Condition  he  contracts  Things or  magnifies  them when they fall in his Way 'till he has  adapted  them to his  Talent  of presenting every Thing  ridiculously  WE have the very  Reverse  of this  Character  in the  frankhearted Major Stedfast  a Brave and Able Officer the  Reward  of whose  Merit  has been  Oppression  and  Injustice  yet so  firm  is the manly  Generosity  of his Temper that at one and the same Time he  vindicates  his Character with the Boldness of an  injur'd  Sol∣dier and offers Arguments in Excuse for the  Rashness  of his Ruiner Imputing to  Credulity  and the  Malice  of Misrepresenters what his Friends All consider as an Act of  Violence  and  Barbarity  There is no  Subject  which he oftner or with more  Pleasure  enlarges on than the  great  and  noble Qualities  of the Man who has  undone  him Nay he talks even of his  Justice  with as much  Warmth  and  Seriousness  as if he had himself been oblig'd by it  THE  Major  and  Ned Volatile  are the  North  and  South Poles  of our  Assembly Ned speaks  and the  Major thinks  The first is always  pleas'd  but the other always  pleases  There is a  Humanity  in the  Major  's  Air  that never fails to mark him out as the common Friend of the Company and a kind of  Majestick Tenderness  in his Behaviour gives him the  Authority  of their  Father  He corrects and approves with Openness and is at once  severe  and  amiable  There is a solemn  Force  and  Weight  in the Manner of his  speaking  which seems to borrow its  Equality  from the  Steddiness  of his  Principles  He esteems without  Transport  and condemns without  Anger  What is  Fancy  in  Ned Volatile  is  Reason  in the  Major  The One has a  Judg∣ment  that is  Solid  and  Plain  The Other an  Imagination  that is Sparkling and Wanton  IT is a very frequent and agreeable Enter∣tainment which arises to the  Assembly  out of the natural  Opposition  of these two  Characters  who yet preserve a  Decorum  by Effect of the Regard each has for the other The  Major  loves  Ned  's Chearfulness But thinks him  trifling  and  impertinent  And  Ned Volatile  hears with Reverence the Wisdom of the  Major  but would  like  him a great deal better if he would be  merrier  and more  noisy  WE had lately the Pleasure of hearing in a full Meeting some of the newest  Opera Songs  by a skilful  Italian Lady  who  has been  famous on our  Theatres  and is equally remarkable for the  Sweetness  of her  Voice  and the  Strength  of her  Features  she is an Acquaintance of the  Widow  who asked us assoon as she was gone  our Opinion of this Person to whom we all knew her  Partial Ned Volatile  prevented  any  Answer but his  own  and desir'd He might have Liberty to give it  under his Hand  He had Pen and Ink brought him and every Bo∣dy was grown  Impatient  for the Product of his  Muse  when he presented it in the following VERSES from  Randolph  NOW Shame pursue my  medling Sight  Wou'd  I had been  All Ear  to Night  Sweet is her  Voice  as Flow'rs in  June  But ne'er was  Face  so out of  Tune  Lower  than  Gammut  are her  Eyes  Her  Nose  does above  Ela  rise  Were I to chuse my self a  Dear  Not by my  Eye  but by my  Ear  Here  wou'd I fixcou'd I but  woo  The  Sound  without the  Substance  too  Some Women are  All  Tongueand oh  What Joy 'twou'd be were  This  but so  Harmonious  Gods  to ease my Mind  Or strike her  Dumb  or make me  Blind  NO sooner had  Ned Volatile  repeated his  Verses  but a General Applause of  Laughter  was return'd him by the Company All but the  Widow  the  Major  and  Myself  were ex∣travagantly transported with the  Humour  and the  Satire  And  Ned  was triumphantly  expand∣ing  his  Poetry  with an Air of  Levity  and  Satisfaction  when the  Major  to prevent  a second Reading of what he saw was  distasteful  to some Part of the  Assembly  began to speak in this Manner  THE Company must acknowledge they are oblig'd to Mr  Volatile  for the Pains he is at to  please  them But if he were as  inclinable  to  reason  as he is to  entertain  no Body could convince us sooner that the  finest Ri∣dicule  is to be considered but as  Cruelty  where it borrows its Subject from Mens  Natural Defects  or their  Miseries  I know very well that whatever savours of  Instruction  is of∣fensive in  Conversation  and that nothing is more  insupportable  than a  Liberty  People take of prescribing  Rules  to all the World We presently wish to fly the Society of those who  dogmatize  For the Mind of Man is Generous and  resists  Truth or  receives  it as its Approaches are  Rude  or  Gentle  But then there is an equal Inconvenience in the  contrary Extream  And if we wou'd enjoy Conversation with a Delicacy of  Wit  we should have Liberty to  bound  it by the In∣terposition of our  Judgment  THE  Harmony  of this Lady who has so agreeably entertain'd us is a  Beauty  that might weigh against the Absence of other Charms more frequent and perhaps less valuable 'Tis the Motherly Indulgence of  Nature  to rob us of  no  Benefit without bestowing on us some other in a double Proportion How seldom do we find  all  Accomplishments united in the  same  Person  Some  are  happy  in their Humour and have their Spirits full of  Fire  and  swift  and  subtil  in their  Motion Others  not so  sprightly  have a Blood more  cold  and  phlegmatic  but the Course of their Animal Spirits being  tempe∣rately  regulated they are  cautious  in  Deli∣beration strong  and  constant  in  Resolution  and  unshaken  in their  Enterprizes  How  visi∣ble  is this  Difference One  is  airy  and  faceti∣ous  the  Other thoughtful  and  judicious  The  Wit  of  One  is  sharp  the  Sense  of the  Other solid  I REMEMBER to have seen during the last War in  Flanders  in a Town where I had my WinterQuarters a wonderful Example of this  Recompence  observ'd by Nature An old Man who had been born blind and had always continued so had a natural  Sagacity  that was  prodigious  and scarce  credible  A Legacy being left him to the Value of  Fifty Pistoles  the poor Man who had never ex∣pected to be Master of such a Sum was un∣der no small  Solicitude  how to secure his Possession of it He determin'd at last to dig a Hole in the Cellar and hide it But it happen'd that a  Dutch  Soldier who was quartered in the House saw him bury the Purse and went afterwards and stole it The Blind Man bethinking himself of a Place  more  convenient return'd in an Hour or two and discover'd his Misfortune for which he con∣triv'd an ingenious Remedy by  detecting  the  Author  of it which he judg'd to have been  the  Dutch  Soldier but the Difficulty was  how  to  prove  it  THEY lay in the same Room and at Night when they were in Bed the Blind Man began under Pretence of Friendship and Confidence to consult with the Soldier concerning a Necessity which he said he was under to  hide  a  hundred Pistoles  To say Truth added he I have  hid fifty  of them  to Day  and would dispose of the  other fifty  in the same Place to Morrow only I am desirous to be satisfy'd Whether in Point of  Conscience  such a Practice is  unlawful  My Relations being so extravagant that they would  waste  it all if they could come at it  THE  Soldier  swallowed the  Bait  and  ar∣gued  like a  Casuist  to confirm the Intenti∣on expecting now to get it  all  He rose therefore betimes and going into the Cellar restor'd the fifty Pieces to the Hole he had taken them from The Blind Man went af∣terwards and recover'd his Money as he expected by the Success of his Stratagem  HERE the  Major  clos'd his  Speech  and it was difficult to say which had most pleas'd the Hearers His  Story  or his  GoodNature Ned Volatile  himself tho' his  Vanity  was a  little  shock'd felt an Awe from the  Vertue  and  PlainDealing  of his Friend and looking  generously out of Countenance  told the  Major  with a serious Smile  'That in Company of 'the  Wise  none are  Foolish  but the  Witty  YET to shew you said he by this Time beginning to recover himself That I have  edified  by your  Sermon  I will make an  ho∣nourable Amends  to the  Ladies  by producing the Example of a  Living Glory  to their  Sex  who has also been pleasant on a  natural De∣fect  but in a manner much more  Generous  She made them on a  Boy  that was  Dumb  but of excellent  Quickness  of  Parts  And I speak with the more  Pleasure  in  Praise  of this  Lady  because I know I can do no∣thing more  acceptable  to the  Major  whom I have often heard declaring himself One of Her  devoted Admirers  I Sing the Boy who  gagg'd  and  bound  Has been by  Nature robb'd  of  Sound  Yet has she found a gen'rous Way  One Loss  by  many Gifts  to pay  His  Voice  indeed she close  confin'd  But bless'd him with a  speaking Mind  And ev'ry  Muscle  of his Face  Discourses  with peculiar Grace  The  LADIES  tatling o'er their  Tea  Might learn to  charm  by copying  Thee  If  Silence  thus can  Man  become  All  Women Beauties  shou'd be  dumb  Then  happy Boy  no more complain  Nor think thy Loss of  Speech  a Pain  Nature  has us'd thee like  good Liquor  And  cork'd  thee but to make thee  quicker  THE  Major  embrac'd  Ned Volatile  with a fatherly Pride and Tenderness And there was not One in Company who did not think it a  Happiness  to be guilty of a  Fault  which had furnish'd an Opportunity of  repenting  so  gracefully  THE PLAIN DEALER No  fratremque ruentem  Sustentat dextra  VIR  MONDAY  April    THERE is Nothing more  talk'd  of and less easily  found  than  Friendship  Every One  Pretends  to  It  and not  One  in a  Million  really  Possesses  this  Noble Passion  which is the most Generous that can  Actuate  and  Adorn  the  Soul  of Man being as Necessary a  Cement  in Private and Domestick Life as  Publick Faith  to  Publick Society  and the greater Commerce of the World  FOR Want of Authentick and Real Ex∣amples of this  Noble Quality  so conducive to Pleasure as well as Profit the Antient Poets have had Recourse to Fiction and told us Stories of their  Pylades  and  Orestes  but we  will entertain the Reader with the greatest Action of  Generous Friendship  that Human Na∣ture is capable of  Performing  and this from an Author of  unexceptionable  Credit who was both an Eye and Ear Witness to Part of the Story which is more remarkable by happening between  Two Brothers  whom the constant Ob∣servation of all Ages has  remark'd  to be  less  often Friends notwithstanding the Ties of Blood than other Persons insomuch that  Vir∣gil  who had a Perfect Knowledge of  Human Nature  has thought fit as it were Proverbially to express himself on this Occasion  Et infidos agitans Discordia Fratres  IN the Beginning of the XVIth Century the  Portugueze  Carracks sailed from  Lisbon  to  Goa  a very great Colony of  Portugueze  in the  EastIndies  These Carracks are the largest Vessels that press the Ocean On Board of one of them were Twelve Hundred Souls Mariners Merchants Passengers Priests and Fryars who were going on their several Missions esta∣blished in  China  and the  Indies  The Begin∣ning of their Voyage was Prosperous they had doubled the  Cape of Good Hope  and were steer∣ing  NorthEast  to the Continent of  India  when some Gentlemen on Board having studied  Geo∣graphy  and  Navigation  found in the Latitude in which they then were a very great Ridge of Rocks laid down in their Sea Charts upon this they apply'd themselves to the  Captain  of the Ship and acquainted him with the Danger which they apprehended desiring him at the same Time to communicate what they had discovered to the  Pilot  which Request he immediately gratify'd recommending to the  Pilot  to lie by in the  Night  and slacken Sail by  Day  'till they should be past the Danger By the Discipline of the  Portugueze  Navy the Sailing Part is absolutely committed to the Care of the  Pilot  who is answerable with his Head for the safe Carriage of the King's Ship and under no manner of Direction from the  Captain  who commands in all other Respects  INSTEAD of complying with so reasonable a Request on which the Safety of so many Lives depended the insolent  Pilot  thinking it an Affront to be taught in his own Art crowded more Sail than he carried before  THE Observations of these Gentlemen were too true not to have a fatal Issue They had not sailed many Hours but just upon Break of Day which would have been prevented if they had lain by the Ship struck upon a Rock and broke her Back  I LEAVE to the Reader's Imagination what a Scene of Horror this must be the Fright of Twelve hundred Persons in the same inevita∣ble Danger at the Sight of that instantaneous Death which star'd them in the Face  THE  Captain  in this Distress order'd the Pinnace to be launch'd into which after hav∣ing toss'd in a small Quantity of Biscuit and some few Boxes of Marmelade he got himself  with nineteen others who seeing the Danger of a Crowd in the common Horror rushing in∣to the Boat drew their Swords and prevented the coming in of any more The same Neces∣sity oblig'd them immediately to put off lest their Pinnace should be drawn in by the Suction of the sinking Carrack  HERE their Eyes were entertain'd with the most dismal of Spectacles the Sight of their sinking Friends and their Ears with the Cries of so many in the same Misery whom they could not help without their own Destruction a Scene of Woe which nothing could alleviate but the Reflection that they themselves were not in the same Extremity though humanly speaking they were not in a much better Con∣dition being destitute on the vast  Indian  Ocean in an open Boat without any Compass to direct them without any fresh Water but what must fall from those Heavens whose Mercy alone could deliver them To which must be added the inevitable Danger of being overset by the first Wind that should raise the Waves besides the Certainty of perishing assoon as their small Stock of Provisions should be spent which only serv'd to prolong their Miseries by reserving them for a more lingring and cruel Death In this Distress after they had for four Days row∣ed to and fro without Guide or Direction the Captain who had been sick and very weak for some Time overcome with Grief and Fa∣tigue died This added if possible to their Misery for now they fell into the last Con∣fusion  Every one would Govern and none would Obey This oblig'd them to chuse one of their own Company to command them whose Orders they agreed implicitly without any Reserve to follow  THE Choice fell upon a Gentleman who was what the  Portugueze  call a  Mestizzo  that is one begotten between an  European  and an  Indian  This Person vested with his new Authority proposed to the Company to draw Lots and throw every fourth Man overboard by Reason their Provision was spent so far as not to last above three Days longer They were now Nineteen Persons in all in this Number were a Fryar and the Carpenter both whom they would exempt by Reason of their being so necessary the One to Ab∣solve and Comfort them in their last Extremi∣ty and the other to take Care of the Boat in Case of a Leak or other Accident the same Compliment they paid to their new Captain he being the odd Man and his Life of more Consequence than any of the rest He refu∣sed a great while but at last acquiesced so that there were four to dye out of the sixteen remaining  THE Three first on whom the Lot fell after having confess'd and receiv'd Absoluti∣on submitted to their Fate  THE Fourth whom Fortune condemn'd was a  Portugueze  Gentleman who had a younger Brother in the Boat who seeing him about to be flung overboard most tenderly embraced  him and with Tears in his Eyes besought him to let him dye for him enforcing his Ar∣guments by telling him That  He was a Mar∣ried Man and had a Wife and Children at  Goa  besides the Care of three Sisters who absolutely de∣pended upon him That as for himself he was single and his Life of no great Importance he therefore conjur'd him to let him supply his Place  THE Elder Brother astonish'd and melted with this Generosity replied That  since the Providence of  GOD  had appointed him it would be wicked and unjust to suffer any other to dye for him especially a Brother to whom he was so infinitely oblig'd  THE Younger would take no Denial but flinging himself on his Knees held his Brother so fast that they could not disengage them Thus they disputed for a while the Elder Bro∣ther bidding him  be a Father to his Wife and Children and as he would inherit his Estate take Care of their common Sisters  but all he could say made him not desist This was a Scene of Tenderness which must fill with Pity any Breast susceptible of generous Impressions  AT last as it is no difficult Thing to per∣suade a Man to live the  Constancy  of the Elder Brother yielded to the  Piety  of the Younger he acquiesced and suffered the Gallant Young Man to supply his Place who being flung in∣to the Water when he came to it could not be content to dye but being a very good Swimmer got to the Stern of the Pinnace and  laid hold with his right Hand which being perceiv'd by one of the Sailors he cut off the Hand with a Cutlass upon which dropping into the Sea he caught hold again with his Left which received the same Fate by a second Blow thus dismembered in his two Hands he made a shift notwithstanding to keep him∣self above Water with his Feet and two Stumps  THIS moving Spectacle so raised the Pity of the whole Crew that they cry'd out  He is but one Man let us save him  which was ac∣cordingly done and he taken into the Boat had his Hands bound up as well as the Place and Circumstances would permit They row'd all that Night and next Morning when the Sun arose as if Heaven would reward the Gal∣lantry and Piety of this Young Man and for his Sake save all the rest they descry'd Land which prov'd to be the Mountains of  Mozam∣bique  in  Africk  where the  Portugueze  have a Colony hither they all safely got where they staid 'till the next Ships from  Lisbon  pass'd by and carried this Company to  Goa  where  Linschotten  a  Dutch  Author of good Credit assures us That he himself saw them land supp'd with the two Brothers that very Night saw the Younger with his Stumps and had the Story from both their Mouths as well as from the rest of the Company  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Dulcis Odor Lucri  didicisse fideliter Artes  Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros  HOR  FRIDAY  April    AMONG the  Benefits  we owe to  Trade  there is One  Disadvantage  unavoidably annexed to  It  It  weakens  our  Humanity  and  eradicates  an  open Confidence  which most Men are  born  with but  lose  as it were  insensibly  by the Influence of  low Maxims  such as are early imprinted on the Minds of  all  who are  educated  to the Arts of  Bargaining  THE  Notions  of such Men unless in some  extraordinary  Cases are strangely  narrow  and  confin'd  They are seldom  capable  of  relishing  or even of  comprehending  the Extent of a  dis∣interested Beneficence  Their  Wisdom  is but  Cunning  and their  Learning  is a  Craft  When they hear the Fame of some  vast Bounty  some  Expansion  of the  Soul  that is  unusual  and  astonishing  instead of that  Emotion  and  warm Transport  of Heart which it  excites  in the  Generous  all  their  Wonder is the  Effect  of their  Incapacity  to  conceive  it for measuring  it by a Supposition That there  must  be some  latent Design  they are at a  Loss  to account  for  the  Gain  or the  Drift  of it  CIVILITY in these Men is not  Manners  but  Mystery  Their  Friendships  are a Kind of  Barterings  for  Exchange  of  Good Offices  and the  weakest  of their  Passions  are their  Love  and their  Pity  NO  Condition  of Life can be more  afflicted  and  mortifying  than the  Misery  of  Owing Mo∣ney  to these  Scantlings  of  Humanity  They consider you  then  no longer on the Foot of Merit or Quality but as if Good Manners and Decency were their  Ready Money Commo∣dities  they throw off all  Respect  and grow  brutal  and  unsociable  Mr  Hawthorn  my Neighbour the  Sussex  Justice of the  Quorum  came lately into the  Assembly  with a  Mien  disturb'd and  Martial  He swung his Arms like a  Pendulum  His Face was flush'd and flaming and his whole Gesture  menacing  He puff'd and breath'd short sat him down in one of the Windows threw his Hat upon the Floor and as soon as he cou'd speak intelligibly gave us loudly to understand That he had been waiting six Hours in a Tavern without eating or drink∣ing with a furious Determination to  break  the  Head  of the  Vintner  Is this said he the GoodBreeding of your  Welcomemongers  that keep  Taverns  Is  this  the little flattering scraping sneering wagtail  Fellow  that us'd to be so  ready  and so  nimble  To rub his  Hands and wriggle forward like a Spaniel to the StreetEnd of his Entry  Odsbobs  it was a lucky  Reprieve  for his  Bones  that he was gone down to the  CustomHouse  for I am verily convinc'd that in the  Fury  of my  Heart  I shou'd have  broke  the  King's Peace  tho' I had  lost  my  Commission  for't  THE  Assembly  was by this Time in a  Mid∣way  Disposition betwixt  Mirth  and  Astonish∣ment  when he threw me a rumpled Paper and  nodded  at me to open it I did so in some Confusion and perceiv'd it was a  Letter  which upon a second  permissive Nod  I read aloud to the Company  For 'Squire  Robert Hawthorn  These  SIR  I SHUD a'thought how such as you shud a been a Man of  Honour  Your Friend as gave you a Character promis'd That you was  Ready Money  for that Pipe of  Neat Port  as I sent away by your Order to the Car∣rier's in the  Borough  But I find no such Matter I ha' writ one Letter

little at a Loss how to act in this Business for it happen'd unfortunately that I had recommended Mr  Winpenny  to my worthy Neighbour Mr  Hawthorn  so that I was un∣der some Surprize and in Perplexity what to say When  Ned Volatile  whose  Levity  is some∣times of  much Weight  interpos'd very sea∣sonably and with his usual  Vein  of  Humour  LEND your Cudgel to  Me  Mr  Justice  o'the  Quorum  for if you shou'd  pay  him your self you will pay him with  Interest  Besides it is an Honour that every Body does not  merit  to be  beat  by a  Magistrate  The Matter is not so  great  neitherIf you will do me but the Favour to sup to Night at my Lodg∣ings there's  my Man  now I'll warrant you can produce half a Score such  tender Billets  as thisI give 'em him once a Week to cut out into  Fringes  for my  Candlesticks  But as to poor  Winpenny  he's an honest Fellow at Bottom and no worse than a  Miser  But so  pleasantly  covetous that if you were as  learn'd  in him as I am you wou'd forgive him out of  Gratitude  for the  Laughter  he wou'd afford youShall I tell you a merry  Story  of himPoor  Winpenny  you must know lost a Cargo of Wine that was coming to him from  Lis∣bon  and in the Anguish of his Heart he re∣solv'd to  live no longer  He ty'd a Rope about his Neck and fast'ning it to a Beam in his Cellar jump'd  heroically  off from an  unlucky  empty Hogshead that tumbled down from its Stand and alarm'd one of his Drawers who  was unseasonably Vigilant The silly Rogue  cry'd out  and I happening at that Time to be Drinking behind the  Bar  run immediate∣ly down and as IllLuck wou'd have it came Time enough to cut the RopeGreat Endeavours were us'd to compose his ruffled MindBut when he was told the next Morning in what Manner he was preserv'd he grew desperate and uncomfortable And nothing wou'd serve his Turn but his Rope must be  paid for  I have the Bill at Home uncancell'd where he charges me by Way of Postscript with this remarkable Arti∣cle  For Cutting a New Rope what you please or think reasonable  MR  Hawthorn  lost his Anger in  Ned Vo∣latile  's Start of Pleasantry and the  Assembly  grew compos'd and took Occasion from this Incident to enter upon a serious and instru∣ctive  Chain  of  Reasoning  on the  Loveliness  of that  Quality  which is call'd  Generosity  At the Close of which the  Major  who had listen'd from the Beginning with a silent Approbati∣on and a Face augustly sweeten'd with an  Amiable Reverence  took his Turn in the Con∣versation And as soon as he offer'd to speak a chearful Expectation appear'd in the  Eyes  of the whole Company and every Body paid him the Homage of a voluntary Attention  I have been greatly delighted said this  Friend  of  Mankind  with the  Discourse  which I have heard of an  Excellence  I  love  And which I remember a fine  Experience  of by  a Companion of mine an  agreeable  young Fellow who in an  Exigency  that befel him try'd the  Difference  of Mens NaturesHe applyed himself to Two Persons of whom One was his near  Relation  and the Other had been his  Schoolfellow  He sent each of them a Letter which had the same Contents  Ver∣batim  From the first he had this  Answer  I keep  both  Copies in my  PocketBook  for I should be sorry to lose Either  Dear Tom  YOU could never have applyed your self to me at so unlucky a  Time  as  Now  For I have not a  loose Corn  by me The  Funds  are to me instead of a  strong Box  And you know when they are in such a fair Way of  Rising  one would not willing∣ly  sell out  unless for some  extraordinary  Oc∣casion I send you the  Note  again because it don't fall in my  Way  to make the proposed  Use  of it But I am  heartily  and  sincerely  sorry that it should happen to be thus out of my  Power  For no Body in the  World  can be more willing and ready at all  Times  to serve  You  than  Dear TOMSY  Your loving  Uncle  and real Friend  D W  The  ANSWER  to his other  LETTER  was very different and runs thus  SIR  NO good  News  can be more welcome than a Proof That I am honour'd with the  Friendship  of the  Deserving  I must consider in  this Light  the  Obligation  you have laid me under by that  Confidence  you allowed to my  Professions  of  Sincerity  This  Bill  should have come alone but that I find my self under a Necessity to  rectify  a  Mistake  you have made in the  Note  you sent meForgive me therefore that I return it you I am with the greatest Respect  SIR  Your most Obliged and most Obedient Servant  M Z  THE  Note  which he sent back was that by which my  Friend  had acknowledged his Receipt of the  Money  he desired to borrow and which he promised to repay on  Demand  to the  Lender  or his  Order  All this the re∣fined Obliger had  eraz'd  with his  Pen  and instead of it wrote what follows on the blank Side of the Paper  I do hereby declare That I owe five Hundred  Guineas  to my good Friend Mr S and will always reserve them in a Readiness for his  Call  in Return for the  Pleasure  he has given me by borrowing of me  One Hundred  WHILE we were expressing our  Satisfaction  in this finespirited Instance of the  Art  of  en∣larging  Favours by the  Manner  of conferring them the  Alderman  was observed to have  fix'd  his Eyes on the Floor in a Posture of Thought and Sadness that was very  unusual  in him  Ned Volatile  who had just made a  Tour  round the Table to beg a Pinch of  Spanish  from the  Coquett  's  Venetian SnuffBox  passing close behind the  Alderman  and supposing him fast asleep guided Part of it to his  Nose  and rows'd him into a Fit of  Sneezing  which as soon as he was freed from he looked round for  Ned Volatile  and after a  Half Smile  and a  Sober Wag  of his  Head  thus addressed him∣self to the  Company  I KNEW I owed this  Favour  to the Wan∣tonness of that young  Madcap  who is as full of  Mischief  as a  Monkey  He fancy'd I was  nodding  and truly I am sorry that he hap∣pened to be mistaken for I was  musing  and very  melancholy  This Story of the  Major  's brought afresh into my Mind an extraordinary Accident that I met with my self in the Year of the  Great Frost  that was before the  Revo∣lution  MANY  Losses  that Year had disabled me to make good my Credit so that I was  run upon  by my Enemies and gave myself up for no Better than a  Gone Man  But one Morning earlyI shall never forget itI was just  come down into my  Counting House  in my NightGown and Slipperswhen in comes a Porter and delivers me a Letter and away he goes immediately without asking for an AnswerThe Letter was from a Merchant that had formerly been my Best Friend but we had  broke off  for some Years upon my re∣fusing to lend him a  Thousand Pounds  upon his  Bond  and we had never convers'd since that Time till now that he sent this Letter the Contents of which were to tell me That he was sorry to hear what was reported abroad to the  Discredit  of my  Circumstances  for he knew it must be owing to some  unfortunate  Accident since whatever  Defects  I had I could never  want Frugality  But however says he If  Five Thousand Pounds  can save you call for it when you please and I will lend it you by Way of  Punishment  for an  Unkindness  of Yours formerly And since the Mortification This must give you merits Pardon for your Fault I will  forget it  from this Time forward that we may be Friends again as usual  THE  Alderman  interrupted himself in this Part of his  Story  by a sudden Burst of  Tears  which he strove in vain to suppress and which affected the whole  Assembly  with a  Sympathy  more  touching  than could have been excited by the most pathetick Force of  Elo∣quence  He recover'd himself after a short Pause and went on to inform us That with∣in less than a Week after he had sav'd him∣self from  Ruin  by Receipt of this Money his  generous Friend the  Merchant  fell out of a  Boat  below Bridge and was unfortunately drown'dIt is true continu'd the good  Alderman  I repaid it very punctually and have made all Acknowledgments and done all Services in my Power to his sorrowful  Widow  and his  Children  But  alas  What did all  That  signify  He  was dead that had  Oblig'd  meAnd  gone  beyond all Possibi∣lity of ever knowing how I  repented  my unkind Usage of him and what a  Shame  and a  Change  his  Generosity  had produced in me  He would willingly have spoke more but could not support his  Anguish  and wept again very passionately so that rising ab∣ruptly he hastened out of the Room and left  Us all  in great  Disorder  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Nugis addere Pondus  HOR  MONDAY  April    I YESTERDAY went to see a very agree∣able Friend at whose House I found a handsome Appearance of Young People of both SEXES Upon my Entrance every one  rose and very obligingly proffered me a Seat each insisting on the Preference I should give in Acceptance of the Honour design'd me  AS I was unwilling to disoblige any One where All had treated me with so much Civili∣ty I wink'd at my Friend who with great Formality conducted me to a large ElbowChair and put an End to the Dispute  WHILE I was wondring with a secret Pleasure at such an  unaccustom'd  Piece of  Goodbreeding  and examining the Countenances of the Com∣pany my Friend who till then had discours'd of indifferent Matters told me with a Smile  He had assembled this Sett of Young People with a Promise of shewing them the  PLAIN DEALER  and therefore desir'd I would throw  aside  all  Re∣servedness  and look upon  every one  as my  pro∣fess'd Admirer  and  Friend which was imme∣diately confirm'd by a  General Reverence  I THANK'D him for the  Favour  he had done me in introducing me to such Agreeable Society and could not help discovering by my Looks the inward Satisfaction I felt at the Sight of so much  Youth  and  Beauty  which ended in that melancholy Reflection  How many  Dangers  it was  expos'd  to and how easily it might be  vitiated  WHEN the TeaEquipage was remov'd and every One remained silent in Expectation of what I should say the Charming  Leonilla  my Friend's Eldest Daughter after having first fix'd her Eyes on a Young Lady that sat op∣posite to her and then on me desir'd in Be∣half  of Part of the Company I would give my Opinion in the Case of  That  Restriction  Young Women lie under who from a  Custom  which in her Opinion had no  just Grounds  for its Support are  forbid  by  Decency  let their  Passion  be the most  vertuous  and  tender  that was ever felt to make the least  Advance  by which the Party belov'd may  discover  the  Sen∣timents  they have in his Favour  To which I answer'd  A Woman of Sense can never  feel  that  Tenderness  for a  Fool  and a Man of  Sense  would always reckon such a  Declaration  a  Desire  of  enjoying  that  Happiness  whose  Basis  is  Love  and whose  Support  is  Virtue  AFTER I had delivered my Opinion in Fa∣vour of  Leonilla  I turn'd to the Lady with whom I could perceive by the Blush in her Cheeks she had been disputing and told her  There was a  false  as well as a  true  Decency and that  One  consisted in  Grimace  and  Shew  the  Other  in an  open Deportment  the  Result  of an unaffected disinterested  Love  of  Virtue  And that it would always be found a Man has no more Reason to  conceive Hopes  from the  free Con∣verse  of the  Latter  than to  fear Success  from the  distant Carriage  of the  Former True Vir∣tue  wants no Foil and is never talking of itself  False Virtue  sensible of its  Weakness  is forc'd to have Recourse to  Hypocrisy  and is ever boasting a  Strength  it is a  Stranger  to  AS I was running on in this grave Dis∣course I was interrupted by a young Gentle∣man who told us he had just met with a Copy  of VERSES said to be written by Lady  Wy Me  wherein he thought there was the most Delicate Sense of  Virtue  mixed with the most agreeable  Turn  of  Wit  Upon the whole Company's desiring to see it he pulled a Paper out of his Pocket and read as follows  The RESOLVE  WHilst  Thirst  of  Praise  and vain  Desire  of  Fame  In  ev'ry  Age is  ev'ry  Woman's  Aim  With  Courtship  pleas'd of  silly Toasters  proud  Fond of a  Train  and happy in a  Crowd  On each poor Fool bestowing some  kind Glance  Each Conquest owing to some  loose Advance  Whilst vain  Coquets  affect to be  pursu'd  And think they're  virtuous  if not  grossly lewd  Let this Great  MAXIM  be my  Virtue  's Guide  In  Part  she is to blame who has been try'd  He comes  too near  that comes to be  Deny'd  WE all agreed in the  Character  he had given of this little  Piece  particularly a Gentleman who has a Smattering in  Poetry  who  not to be behindhand with the  Sex  in Modesty  pro∣duc'd the subsequent Lines which he desir'd I would read to the Company  ANSWER  to the  RESOLVE  WHilst empty  Coxcombs  blast a Woman's  Fame  In  ev'ry  State and  ev'ry  Age the  same  With their own  Folly  pleas'd each  FAIR  they  toast  And where they  least  are happy swear they're  most  No  Diff'rence  marking 'twixt the Gay and Lewd  But dreaming All who fly wou'd be pursu'd  Whilst thus they vainly  think  and vainly  live  Lost to that Reverence Love's soft Lessons give  Let this Great  MAXIM  be my  Passions  Guide  May I ne'er  hope where  I am ne'er  deny'd  Nor gain a Woman willing to be  try'd  IF before we were  loud  in  Commendation  of the First here we were  extravagant  the LADIES opprest him with Thanks and told him  He should lose Nothing by the  Generous Opinion  he had entertain'd of the  SEX To which a  Wag  in Company with an  envious Smile  reply'd  'If he should  lose  Nothing by it he was sure he would  get  Nothing but what wou'd be merited by his Mortifi∣cations  MY Friend perceiving both Parties grew warm desir'd them before they went on to consider what they were saying since he was persuaded the PLAIN DEALER would print the  Occurrences  of that Day Upon which they all  compos'd  their Looks and a  general Silence  ensued When my  Friend  turning to me  'You see says he the Ne∣cessity of a Man of your Character Ev'ry  way you're Serviceable the  Publick  feels

me I should hardly have been prevail'd upon to make publick  To the  PLAIN DEALER  April  th  SIR  THE best  Construction  I can put upon your Attempt is  Vanity  or  Folly  for unless you look upon yourself as  superior  to the Authors of the  Tatlers Spectators Guardians FreeThinkers  c You are very  weak  to think any Thing  inferior  can be  relish'd  by  those  who are Admirers of  Them

DEALER No  Pasces in Cruce Corvos  HOR  FRIDAY  May    I HAVE as just a Veneration as any Man living for the  Laws  of my Native Coun∣try They are generous mild and gentle built on equal  Foundations  of  Justice  and  Mer∣cy  And to say all in a Word they are such as every  Freeman  wou'd  wish  to be govern'd by I am so far from denying them the  Re∣verence  they deserve that I have always read with Pleasure the most elaborate and strain'd  En∣comiums  with which the  Gentlemen  of the  Robe  fill their  Writings  on this  Subject  BUT since it is the most  desireable  among all the Advantages of  Liberty  to think and speak freely it cannot I hope be offensive if I declare myself not well satisfy'd with any Arguments I have yet heard in Defence of  Capital Punishment  for certain  Crimes  which are low and frequent And which carry me∣thinks no Proportion in Comparison with others of a much blacker Complexion to which notwithstanding they seem  parallell'd  by the Equality of their  Sentence  THE  Life  of a Man is so infinitely of more Value than his  Beast  or his  Moveable  that whenever I see the Sufferings of pinch'd and hungerstarv'd  Wretches  under the Agonies of an  Execution  for having  robb'd  perhaps to avoid  famishing  I find myself oppress'd by a  Grief  which nothing mitigates but this  Reflection  That their  Lives  were expos'd to such Extremities of Want and Misery that their  Death  should be a ComfortAnd yet the long protracted Gazings the Paleness the Tremblings and the ghastly distorted Faces of the poor departing Strugglers who die with strong Reluctance and linger and lengthen out their last painful Moment make it evi∣dent to the  Beholders  That Unfriendly as the World was to them they are not willing to forsake it  I AM convinc'd that if it were possible to see on some such  Plain  as that of  Salisbury  under one assembled Prospect the whole Num∣ber of Men and Women who have been exe∣cuted  for Theft only  in all the Counties of this Kingdom within the Memory of any Per∣son of but a moderate Advance in Years such a dreadful Demonstration of the  Waste  which is made by this  Sweep  of the  Sword  of  Justice  would be a startling Inducement to those whose Province it is known to be to weigh with Pity and Deliberation whether Punish∣ments more  adequate  and more  politick  too than  Death  might not easily be appropriated to a Number of  Petty Crimes  which ever were and ever must be unavoidably frequent in all peopled Places being the necessary Con∣sequences either of the  Wants  or the  Depra∣vity  of the lowest Part of the  Human Species  ONE Evening very lately All my Neigh∣bourhood in  Barbican  were in an Uproar on a sudden and I was disturb'd in my Medi∣tations by the shrieking of Women the mix'd Cries of Children and a growing  Hum  of Con∣course that seem'd close under my WindowI threw aside my Pipe and hastening to look out saw the Street entirely fill'd by a  Groupe  of dismal Faces that had gather'd themselves into a Tumult about a House directly opposite and appear'd to be touch'd as strongly as Common Natures are capable with a Mixture of  Surprize  and  Sorrow  It seems the Husband of a laborious poor Crea∣ture  who was Mistress of this House had been condemn'd at the County Assizes in one of the late Circuits for stealing a Horse And a Letter had just now been deliver'd to his Wife which the Criminal himself had writ∣ten the very Morning he was executed  HIS Relations and Acquaintance had de∣pended on a  Reprieve  for the Man was uni∣versally belov'd among his Neighbours And tho' always very poor and unfortunate in his Dealings had been remarkable for his Industry of a sober Disposition and never known be∣fore to have been guilty of the least Disho∣nesty He had Six Children alive and the Eldest but Eight Years old His Mother who liv'd in the same little House had been disabled by Sickness for several Months past So that perceiving it beyond his Power to subsist his Family any longer and not daring to stay in Town by Reason of some Debts he had contracted he went down to  try his Friends  who liv'd in good Circumstances in the Country But instead of meeting with  Assistance  he only spent in this Journey all the little he had carried with him And not being able to support the Thoughts of return∣ing  without Bread  to a Family in such want of it he rode away with a Horse which he found ty'd to a Gate and being pursu'd and overtaken was try'd condemn'd and hang'd for it  THIS History was loudly given me by the good Women in the Street after which  I had the Curiosity to press in among the Crowd and was struck at my first Entrance by the most  moving  Scene of  Sorrow  that I ever remember to have met with The Wi∣dow had broke open her Husband's Letter in Transport concluding That it brought her the Confirmation of a  Reprieve  which a former had given her Hopes of But she was so shock'd and overwhelm'd by the sudden Reverse of Pas∣sion that her Grief was a kind of  Madness  She sat on the Floor without Headcloaths and had an Infant cross her Knees that was crying with great Impatience for the  Breast  it had been thrown from Another  slept  in a  Cradle  close by a little  Bed  in which the  Grandmother  sat weeping bending forward in strong Agony and wringing her Hands in silence The Four Eldest Children were gather'd into a Knot and clung about the Neck of their miserable Mother  stamping screaming  and  kissing her  in a Storm of distracted  Tenderness  The poor Woman  herself  was in a Condition  past describing  She press'd the Letter of her  dead Husband  to her  Eyes  her  Lips  her  Bosom  She rav'd and talk'd and question'd him as if he had been presentAnd at every little Interval dry'd her  Tears  with his  Letter  And cast a Look upon the Com∣pany so  wild  and so full of  Horror  that it cannot be conceiv'd but by those who were Witnesses of it  AS soon as she saw  me  there she stretched out her Hand and made Signs that I should read  the Letter which I received from her accord∣ingly And going back to my Lodging with a Resolution to send over some fitter Person than myself to assist in the Distresses of so dis∣consolate a Family I sat down and took a Copy of it because it  moved  me exceedingly  Dear Loving  Betty  IT is now nine a Clock and I must be fetch'd out by and by and go to die before Eleven I shall see my poor  Bess  no more in this World but if we meet one another again in the next as I hope in God we shall we may never part after∣wards Methinks if I cou'd but only once more look upon my good  Betty  before I die tho' it shou'd be but for a Minute and say a kind Word to my Fatherless Children that must  Starve now  if God don't take Care for them I should go away with a good Heart And yet sometimes I fancy it is better  as it is  for it wou'd be  sad  to die afterwards and I fear it wou'd make me faint∣hearted and I should be wishing that I might live to get you  Bread  and Cloaths for your poor precious Bodies  Sarah Taylor  made my Heart ake when she told me that you had pawn'd away every thing to make up that  last fifty Shillings  that you sent me by  Will Sanderson  who is now in the Room with me and sits down upon the  Straw  that I laid on last Night and is weeping for me like a Child But God will make up all the Money to you again that you have let me have to no purpose And I should be sorry that any unkind Body should hit  it in your Teeth that I come to such an untime∣ly bad End For I thought as little of it as they do But all the Way as I walked up to  London  afoot I could not help having a Fan∣cy in my Head at every Turn That I saw my poor dear  Betty  and my six helpless little  Ones  hanging upon me and crying out bitterly That they had no Bread to keep Life in 'em and begging me to buy them some And so I thought that I would sell that  Horse  and make you be∣lieve that I got Money of your  Sister Parker  But she was too  Sparing  for  that  and wou'd never once look upon meI pray to God to forgive her and if she wou'd but be Good to  you  when I am gone God bless her  Loving Betty  remember me to my sorrowful Mother and tell her not to  take on  too much And bid  Richard  and  Harry  take Warning by  my Fall  if ever they come to be  Men  And for the poor Girls they are too young as yet to understand any thing you can say to them God's Goodness be your Comfort and if you can don't  think  about  me  for it will make you only melanchollyI hope the Old  Deputy  will be kind to you and help you to do somewhat I am sorry I can't write no more because my Tears are come into my EyesLittle did I think of this  dismal Parting  Oh 'tis very sadGod bless you in this un∣happy World Dear Dear  Betty  From your unfortunate dying Husband R S  PS  Nothing vexes me but when I think that it is a very hard Case for a Man to be made to die for a  Horse  They say the King is to have him he is not worth much but if my poor  Betty  had the Mo∣ney he cou'd be Sold for it wou'd be some Comfort however for then I shou'd not have left you all so  Bare  as you be now  I carry'd this Letter with me to the  Assem∣bly  where it was universally Agreed That there is a plainhearted Honesty very mani∣fest in all Parts of it and a generous and manly Sorrow not arising so much from his own Desire to  Live  as from a Prospect of  their Wants  whom his Death was to leave  Destitute  Our Clergyman in particular was greatly mov'd to Compassion and propos'd a Chari∣table Collection to be sent to the poor  Widow  to which himself contributed  first  in a very liberal Proportion  He related to us afterwards an extraordinary  Dying Speech  of a very different Turn which he heard made when a  Student  by a House∣breaker who was hang'd for  Murder  and a  Robbery  GOOD People said the Criminal  since I am to serve you for a  Sight  the least you can do is to be  Civil  to the Man that  entertains  you I ask nothing of you but the Justice that is due to me There are some medling Tongues  which I can hear among the Crowd very busy to incense you Tho' it is true I have  committed Murder  yet I hope I am  no Murderer  The  Felony  I really purpos'd but my  Intention  had no part in the  Death  that I was Guilty of The Deceas'd cry'd for Help and was so Obstinate and Clamorous that I was under a Necessity to  kill  him or submit my self to be taken And thus I argued in my Mind If I  Murder  him I shall  get off  or at worst if I am taken my Punishment will be  no greater  than if I spare him and  Surrender  I can be  BUT HANG'D  for  Murder  and I must be  HANG'D TOO  for the  Housebreaking  This Thought Good People prevail'd with me to  Shoot  him so that what  you  call  Murder  was but  SelfPreservation  Now that I shou'd have dy'd in this  same Manner  whether I had Shot him or no Witness these two  Weak Brothers  here who look as if they were already at the other End of their  Voyage  tho' they have not  hoisted Sail  yet one of these  Stole some Bacon  and the other a  wet Smock or two  The  LAW  must be certainly  Wiser  than  you are  and since  that  has been pleas'd to set our Crimes on a  Level  be so civil or compas∣sionate as to hold your silly Tongues and let me  die  without  Slander  We had several other Stories on this Sub∣ject of the  Publick Executions  but none pleas'd me better than one which I shall close my Paper with and which we were also oblig'd to the  Vicar  for  THE late King of  Sweden  had con∣demn'd a Soldier to  die  and stood at a little Distance from the Place of Execu∣tion The Fellow when he heard this was in hopes of a  Pardon  but being assur'd he was mistaken cry'd his  Tongue  was yet  free  he wou'd use it at his Pleasure which he did with great License accusing the King most insolently and as loud as he cou'd speak of  Barbarity  and  Injustice  and ap∣pealing to God for  Revenge  of his  wrong'd Innocence  The King not hearing him dis∣tinctly enquir'd of those about him  What the Soldier had been saying  and was told by a General Officer who was unwilling to heigh∣ten his Resentment against the  Miserable  That he had only repeated very often and loud  That God loves the Merciful and teaches the Mighty to moderate their Anger  The King was touch'd by the  Lesson  and sent his Pardon to the Criminal But a Courtier of an opposite Interest took Advantage of this Occasion and repeated to the King ex∣actly the Licentiousness of the Fellow's  Railing  adding gravely when he had done That Men of Quality and Trust ought never in his Opinion to  misrepresent Facts to their Sovereign  The King for some Time stood suspended in his Thoughts but turn∣ing at length toward the Courtier with a Face of Reproof  It is the first Time  says he  that ever I have been betrayed for my Ad∣vantage  But the LYE of your Enemy pleas'd me better than your TRUTH does  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Trahit sua quemque Voluptas  Dic mihi si fueras tu Leo qualis eris  MART  MONDAY  May    THERE are in every Man's Life even the wisest and most fortified certain  Periods  of  Weakness  which demonstrate our common Frailty and seem thrown into our Nature as Preservatives against  Pride  and for the Mortification of Human Vanity  THAT Venerable  Sage  of old who has left us this  Aphorism That no Man should be esteem'd happy 'till after his Death  might have extend∣ed his Observation as well to our  Conduct  as our  Fortune Let no Man during Life be call'd Resolute or Prudent  COULD I ever have thought That after passing my giddy  Youth  in a steddy Contempt of Beauty I should be enslav'd to it  against Judgment  in my Grand  Climacterick  If the Duty of a PLAIN DEALER did not indispen∣sibly oblige me to the most rigid Impartiality  even to the giving Sentence against  myself  with what Face cou'd I confess what I am asham'd when I but think of That I who am a  staid Old Batchelor  am afraid I am fall∣ing in  Love  with  Patty Amble  the  Coquet  who always seem'd to me to have been  born  in a Fit of  Laughter  and never had a  Thought  of  Gravity  but when it furnish'd her with an Oc∣casion to divert herself at the Expence of it  WELL If this should in good Earnest come to pass I shall have a most uncomforta∣ble Time of it What Reason I have had and from what Time to suspect it I shall without Reserve communicate in the Progress of my PAPERS But let it prove what it will the Occasion of this Preamble is from an un∣usual Disorder in which I am come Home this Evening after a kind of frolicksome Ad∣venture with that young  Romp  which has left me under an Impression little better than  Witchcraft  tho' at any Time before  last Easter  I should have thought it  not worth telling  TO Day when she  hoyden'd  into the As∣sembly the whole Company rose together and received her with that Pleasure which her  Gayety  diffuses every where She sailed through us all with a  swimming smiling Port  that was visibly  affected  but irresistably enga∣gingWhen she had flutter'd and fidget∣ed and sloped her self forward and wheel'd down her Hoop to the widest Swell of its  Convex  in a Circular Course of  Curtesies  she tript sideways to her Seat and I was just be∣ginning  to hope  Calm Weather  after such a  Whirlwind  of  Ceremony  when she rose as it were in a  Start  with a Look most  whimsical∣ly Serious  and drawing a Paper from her Bo∣som pac'd demurely to  my Chair  She carry'd her Head to the left side softly sweep∣ing her right EyeBrow with the  Knob  of her  Fan  and sinking forward when she came near me with a Fantastical Air of Languishment brush'd my Mouth with her Paper and be∣gan to play over her Tricks in a long and mystical  Jargon  of  most Womanish Impertinence  AND were they  said she  so naughty to leave it by it's nown self And did no body help it to write it's  PLAINDEALERS  and was it abus'd and overwork'd and neglected Well then let it be Good and mind it's Book and wash it's Face and forget to be cross and comb it's Head and throw away it's dirty Stick and see what I intend to do for it There take it and Print it And don't care a Pin for the Work they have put upon it For I love it and will think for it and bring it good Things And if it wou'dn't look Grim I should buss it and stroak it and chuck it under the Chin and make much of it and play with it and  ccc  AFTER this silly Rate she ran on with a ridiculous but lively and neverending Volu∣bility and perceiving that the Company laugh'd out and were diverted at the grotesque Figure I was making under her Hand's at length she kiss'd me outright and set 'em all  in an  Uproar  I wou'd fain have look'd peevish I turn'd my Face from her and cry'd  Pish  and  Pshaw  and  Fiddle  and shook my Head in a great Heat and winch'd in both Shoulders and much Pains I took to seem nettled and uneasy But to confess a foolish Truth it was all but  mere Show  for I was never so agreeably made an Ass of in my Life and while I felt the busy Wanderings of her Fingers about my Face I was stung I can't tell how with a Kind of tingling Delight all over me which being desirous to prolong I pretended to make Efforts for pushing her away and under that Pretence gave my Hands the Opportunity of  touching  her here and thereAnd I must own I was sorry when she put an End to her  Gambols  BUT as soon as I came home and look'd into her Paper I was not so much an  Ass  far gone as I found Myself but that I pre∣sently discern'd her  Drift  And I wish with all my Heart that I had Courage enough to return it her and tell her in downright Terms  I don't think it worth Printing  But whatever the Cause of this strange Alteration may be there is nothing so dreadful to me as the Dan∣ger of disobliging this  SheCockatrice  Since therefore I am in this odd Manner  bewitch'd  e'en take it in the  arch Flirt's  own Words For it is no Work of mine and I will have nothing to do with it  The  LADIES  Equivalent  A TALE  with a  MORAL  to It  IN the Reign of the Emperor  Justinian  the City of  Constantinople  was much throng'd with  Foreigners  for whose Entertainment  unusual Pastimes  were invented The Publick Theatres were embellish'd interlarded and embroider'd with  Musick Magick  and  Tumbling  and such  unspeakable  Additions as were fittest to give Pleasure to the  Eyes  of  Goths Vandals  and  Saracens  to whom  Plays alone  were insipid because acted in a Language which they were in a Manner wholly Strangers to  THEODORA  the Empress had been formerly a  Comedian  and was a liberal Pro∣moter of whatever cou'd contribute to make Pleasure pompous Among the Numbers who found their Interest in this  Byas  of the  Court  there was a wily and egregious  African  whom for the Flatness of his Nose the Tawniness of his Complexion and a certain  Majestical Bru∣tality  in the Composition of his Features the merry  Greeks  had nicknamed the  LYON  This Man became rich by the universal Encouragement that was given to an odd Project of his startingIt was a Kind of  BlindBuzzard  or  MidnightMummery  of which it is difficult at this great Distance of Time to conceive a clear Notion But Per∣sons of the highest Rank of both Sexes met there disguis'd and under borrow'd Resem∣blances  danc'd regal'd and discours'd with each other at large and disengag'd from all  Ceremony Distinction  or  Punctilio  IT was generally allow'd however by all but the  LYON  's Enemies that nothing pass'd in these Meetings either Scandalous or Misbe∣coming Every thing was Magnificent Orna∣mental and Enlivening But no  Privacies  were permitted nor  Indecencies  connived at  IT fell out notwithstanding most unfor∣tunately for the  LYON  That  Religion  was at this Time very flaming and watchful The  Good Fathers  of the Church became scandalized and alarm'd at the Probability of  Impurities  in this newinvented  Nightwork  For it was dangerous they knew to allow such Latitude to their  Female Flock  while their Shepherds were at Rest who kept the  Wolf  from  biting  them They determine therefore vigorously to  remonstrate  against it But there was One considerable  Rub  that lay full in their Way The  Emperor himself  was often present at these Meetings and indulg'd them as an innocent and agreeable Recreation  TO Remove this heavy  Difficulty  the  Good Fathers  with great  Dexterity  charg'd the Mo∣tive of their  Fears  upon the  Weakness  of the  Women  whose Natures they said were liable to very dangerous  Impressions  from those Whisper∣ings and Squeezings and Inflammations of their  Vanity  They went on to assert That a  Woman  's Defence against  Man  lying rather in her Dread of  Shame  than her Abhorrence of  Iniquity  she shou'd never be thought  Safe  while under the Hazard of  Temptations  The  Men  indeed  they believ'd  might be  strong  enough to  resist  but not their  Wives  and their  Daughters  Weak Vessels and brittle and which wou'd  break  with a  Fall  It were Prudence therefore to place them out of the  publick Reach  and  cupboard  them up for the Houshold Use of their  Owners  So they humbly represented That it wou'd be an Act of great  Piety  and  E∣dification  if his Imperial Majesty gave Com∣mand for the Total  Suppression  of these New  Nurseries  of  Debauchery  IT is one Thing to be  Pious  and another to be  Wise  The Warmth of their  Zeal  had not suffer'd them to consider That there were  Women  of  Wit  and  Spirit  who would vindi∣cate their  Sex's Honour  and make use of their powerful  Influence  to oppose the good  End  of these Reverend Memorialists were it for no other Reason but because the Means were un∣mannerly  THEODORA  the Empress was provok'd to the last Degree and after reproach∣ing their  Partiality  and the mean and false  Idea's  which they had conceiv'd of  Womens Virtue  fell to reason with them in this Manner  HOW Contemptibly wou'd your  Sex  com∣pel us to consider them if all  Men  were to treat us with so ungenerous a  Diffidence  Is it possible think ye That our  Persons  can be won before our  Hearts  have dispos'd of 'em And whenever we  Love passionately  we have Courage to  Act resolutely  and  make  Opportunities if we were not allow'd to  find  'em If you once confine our  Bodies  you set our  Minds  at full Liberty Our  Natures  are too generous to  deceive  those who  trust  us But we think it a  Merit  to make  Fools  of the  Faithless  THE  LYON  grinning horribly behind the Empress's Chair was ready to  roar  with De∣light at this Rebuke to the Fathers But stedfast and immoveable in the  Piety  of their  Purpose  they were about to Reply at Large When the Emperor who had  Meanings  not to be trac'd on his  Countenance  concealing his Resentment return'd this  Answer  to their  Re∣monstrance  I Thank you for this  Religious Simplicity  of your Proceeding You are the  Eyes  of our  Conscience  and  see farther  than we can But I am not more pleas'd with your apply∣ing for  Redress  of this  formidable Grievance  than surpriz'd at your  overlooking  another of like Tendency and which your  laudable Zeal  for  Removing Temptations  must excite you to thank me for resolving to see re∣medy'd  THE  Women  have a  Custom  when they stand in need of  Absolution  to  send for  their Confessor and open their Hearts to him in their  Closets  Were all your Reverend  Or∣der  of equal  Sanctity  with  you  this cou'd possibly administer no just Cause of  Scandal  But since  Nature  is  deprav'd  and there have been  Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing  I conceive  it a Design of  much Edification  to abolish for the future this  Indulgence  of the  Women  and withhold their  Absolution  'till they come for it to the  Churches  Intending therefore to join these  good Purposes  in  One  I commit it to your Care to prepare an  Edict  for  Both  that I may decree it into  Law  with as much speed as possible  THE  Good Fathers  were so unexpectedly and beyond measure  confounded  at this overliberal  Extent  of the Emperor's  pious Purpose  that they stood long at a Loss to find fit Words to thank him But they did it at last with this  Hope  in the  Rear  of  all  That his High and Imperial Majesty  wou'd not hasten them too much in Two Decrees of such Impor∣tance since the Empress had urg'd some Argu∣ments to prove One of them needless and who cou'd tell when they came to examine Things more closely but they might be mistaken in Both of 'em  THUS I have given you the  Coquet's Story  and am well enough aware what the  Gypsy  's Head was running on But if any Body shou'd desire to be made as wise as I am I shall tell 'em an  old Story  and let 'em take it in Satisfaction  'A Philosopher bought some Meat and returning from the Market hid it under his Cloak An Impertinent Fellow met him and wou'd needs know  What it was  It is  there  said the Philosopher on purpose That you  shou'd not know it  THE PLAIN DEALER No  P  r pari referemus  CICERO  FRIDAY  May    LITTLE Follies which we but Smile at in Persons who are Indifferent to us gives us Sorrow and Pain when observ'd in those we Love  Patty Amble  is of late become of such Importance that I watch her with a Tenderness that interests me in all her Acti∣ons For this Reason I am frequently con∣triving to interrupt Her when she lets her Tongue run Races that outgallop her Rea∣son But I always lose my Labour My Operations upon this  Gossip  are like the  Wind's  upon  Fire  I may blow till my Breath failsinstead of  putting her out  I make her  burn  but the  faster  I HAVE succeeded however in what I fail'd to do  Myself  by the Assistance of  Ned Volatile  But not to assume more Triumph than is due to me the Stratagem I made use of was found out by  Shakespear  before me That Poetical Politican taught his  Richard  the Third among the rest of his surprizing Victories to conquer  a  Woman  's  Tongue  but it was by Aid of one of his  Drums  which no sooner Beat up but the Enemy was put to Silence  WE shall now enjoy some Freedom and may all Talk in our Turns for  Ned  and the  Coquet  will be play'd off at Pleasure When either of 'em grows Troublesome we shall let loose the  Rival  and like  Sulphur  and  SaltPetre  one shall blow up the other  PATTY AMBLE  came Yesterday fine∣ly dress'd to the  Assembly  ready to burst with Impatience for our Admiration of her Fancy She kept us Silent above an Hour while she was so kind as to open to us the Labours and Difficulties she had for fourteen Days been  fatigu'd  by before she cou'd unite so elegant∣ly all her trifling Varieties From her Head to her Foot she oblig'd us with the Minutes of her whole Fortnight's History It was not to be expected that in the midst of so much Business she cou'd be at Leisure to consider That after we had approv'd both the Price and Colour of her  Damask  it was of no great Edification at least to the  Male  Part of the Company to know what  Shop  she bought it at But happy had it been cou'd she have found  Rest  so speedily Nothing like it I assure you we were also to learn in what Places she  miss'd  it Yet for my own Part I  must say  I was particularly  edify'd  by her cri∣tical Remarks on certain Differences to be found betwixt buying on  LudgateHill  or of the Mercers about  CoventGarden  BUT ill fare say I that unlucky Word  Garden  It put her fatally in Mind of a Fat freshcolour'd  Country Lady  who cou'd never be persuaded to make Visits in any thing but  Garden Silks  tho' her Arms were as big as a  RollingStone  Then the unfortunate Word  Fat  brought as aptly to her Remembrance poor old  Dimpley  the laughing Staymaker that us'd to Work for her  Grandmother  when first she was Married and never  lac'd  our  Patty  when she was a Girl but she made her  very Neck ake  with twisting it to look back at him At length after infinite Disappointments and Dangers she arriv'd safe at her  HoopPetticoat  where being seiz'd with a  Fit  of Gratitude for the Parliament's  strange good Nature  and ex∣traordinary Care of  Trade  she was  thinking to turn WHIG  because they had taken off the  Duty  that lay so heavy upon  Whalebone  WELL as to that however she was not al∣together so positive But there was one Thing of more Consequence that she was absolutely  convinc'd of  she wou'd venture any  Wager  that not one Person in the Company cou'd be able to  guess  what her  Ground Brussels Head  had cost her a Yard nor where nor by what particular  odd  Accident she had been so hap∣py as to  light of it  The Dutchess of  Mr  took Coach in a Fright the very Moment she saw it to buy up the  Remnant  But since she was sure we  cou'd not guess  she wou'd tell us the Price  her self  and not name one Farthing more or less than it really cost her she wonder'd  for her Part how Women cou'd be  so silly  For what signify'd after all the little  Vanity  of being  thought skill'd in good Pennyworths  If she had a mind to be  Vain  she need only believe what was said to her at the  Opera  by a  cer∣tain Duke  who must be nameless But one Thing his Grace was pleas'd with that she  might  venture to speak of and it was  that Fancy of her own upon her Fan  Lord she remem∣ber'd too he observ'd That there was some∣thing in a Lady's  Fan  much  genteeler in its Use  than any part of the  Mens Equipage  IT was just in this Place that I took Pity of the Company for I thought I  felt their Heads ake  So tipping the Wink on  Ned Vo∣latile  he started up from his Chair with such a  Stare  of Amazement that one wou'd have thought he was apprehensive the House had been falling The  Coquet  started too and hold∣ing her Tongue till she cou'd look round her  Ned  with wonderful Agility snatch'd the  Nick  of that Interval and resolving at once to bear down all Opposition broke in upon her like a Torrent with this sudden Exclamation  '  Ah Madam Madam  What a  Trifle  is a  Fan  in Comparison with a  Feather  I shou'd be sorry to dissent from any Opinion  you  are fond of but pray let your Reason be Judge of this Difference I have  one  in my Hat here that all the  African Ostriches  clubbing Tails to produce the Fellow of it might be  moulting  these thousand Years and all to no Purpose Dear Madam do but look on it  The nearer you examine it the more it will charm you With all your  Wit  now and your  Industry  my Life to one of your  Lappits  it puzzles you these three Hours to  guess where I bought it  I can't be altogether so positive that you won't hit the  Price  of it but upon my Honour if you  shou'd  I'll acknowledge it to a Farthing There's  some Pleasure  in con∣versing on these  critical Affairs  with so nice a Judge as  you Madam  Why here's a  Coat  I have worn this five Weeks and not one in fifty has had the  Taste  to take Notice that all the Wool it was made of is  true unmix'd Spanish  You were saying something about  Whalebone  'Tis a useful Commodity indeed as you  Ladies  have manag'd it but what are  Hoop Petticoats  to the  Woollen Manufacture  'FOR Heaven's sake take Breath cry'd the  Coquet  swiftly Fanning herself and half bursting with a  Windyness  from Suppression of Meanings do but  hear  what I was going to say to you  Never never  reply'd  Ned  he can never be a good Subject who sub∣mits to hear any thing to the Prejudice of the  Woollen Manufacture  Mark the wonderful Pro∣gress of this silly thing call'd  Wool  but from the  Sheep's  Back to  Mine  Take Notice in the first Place of these few of the  many My∣steries  which depend on this humble Material There's the  Grazier  for Example and the  Shepherd  and the  Shearer  and the  Sorter  and the  Comber  and the  Carder  and the  Spinner  and the  Dyer  and the  Scowrer  and the  Fuller  and the  Weaver  and the  Napper  and the  Pres∣ser  and the  Stretcher  and the  Carrier  and the  Factor  and the  Draper  and the  Taylor  and the  Packer  and the  Merchant  But mention∣ing the Word  Merchant  I must stop a little in my Way and lay open to you the Won∣ders and Advantages of  Navigation  I shall inform you clearly and distinctly under their proper Heads and Divisions to what different Corners of the Universe  you  Madam are oblig'd for all those Ornaments which are adorn'd by you I will begin like a good Builder and examine first your  Foundation  That glittering Pair of  Shoes  which we can but see the pointed  Tips  of had a long and tiresome Journey to the prettiest Foot in the  World  from three most distant Parts of it The Silver in their Lacing you are indebted for to  America  Now you wou'd ask me as I go along whence that new Quarter of the Globe took this Name of  America  I shall come to it in its Turn but first you must be acquainted with the Fortunes of its chief Discoverers  Spanish English French Por∣tuguese  and  Hollanders  And for clearing Things more effectually to your Apprehen∣sion I shall with as much Brevity as possible trace the Originals and Histories of these Nations But speaking just now of  Silver  I am presented by that Means with a fortunate Opportunity to Sail away with you for  Peru  and when once I have got you there we shall never want Amusements suited to the  Mercury  of your Spirit For in the first Place Madam I will carry you to the Bot∣tom of those  Mines  which have enrich'd and embroil'd all  Europe  And because I know you are a Lady of most  unsatisfy'd Curiosity  I will now anticipate in some measure this Improvement I design for you for I will enumerate in their pro∣per Order the Subterraneous Inhabitants of the whole  mineral Kingdom  There is  Gold  Madam and  Silver  and  Copper  and  Tin  and  Quicksilver  your Favourite Madam and  Iron  and  Lead  and  Antimony  and  Marchasi∣tes  and  Lapis Calaminaris  and  Pyrites  and  Vitriol  and  Allom  and  Brimstone  and  Sal Gem  and  Crystal  and  Marble  and  Millstone  and  Alabaster  and  Bolus  and  Ochre  and  Talc  Madam And of all these I will immediate∣ly explain to you the Growth and the Ope∣rations and their strange and distinct Uses whether in  Science  or in  Trade  And after∣wards I will take Occasion from this wonder∣ful Provision of Materials for our Industry to demonstrate beyond Denial how needless it is for  Man Woman  or  Beast  to live idle and unuseful But  First  for I wou'd be Regular I must return to your  Shoes  What I was in their second Division to particula∣rize was the  Silk  which they are cover'd with

levell'd his Eye at her Foot when she made her Advantage of the lucky Opportunity which this  Pause  of his afforded her and recovering her lost Ground renew'd her Charge with a Vigour that was fatal to her Opponent  '  BRAVELY Shot  cry'd she laughing but I am not so easily to be  scar'd  I assure you 'Twill be time enough to listen to such wise Harangues as yours after I have talk'd myself weary A most  polite  Entertainment indeed you are designing us With your greasy Generation of  Scowerers  and  WoolCombers  The Assembly will be better pleas'd with the  intricate Prettinesses  which are to be learnt in the Art of  Lacemaking  Oh the dexterous Disposition of the  Cushion  and the  Pattern  and the  Pins  and the  Bobbins    SHE set us all to work but had no sooner entangled us among her  Threads  and her  Bobbins  when she flew on a sudden out of that Subject to another and from that to a third She led us up so far back that we were present at her Mother's  Labour  and af∣ter having been merry at her  Christening  she took us along with her to her Nurse's on  Ban∣sted Downs  From thence to her Father's Coun∣tryHouse beyond  Canterbury  After this we liv'd with her four Years at a  Boarding School  in  Hackney  and returning thence with Plea∣sure had the Honour of her Company to the  very first Play that ever she saw in her Life  nay she permitted us to take Part with her  even in the  Masquerade  and at the  Opera  But the worst of it was that before we were well seated we were drawn away in her  Aunt  's  old Coach  and carry'd down the Lord knows whi∣ther to make Butter and Cheese in  Warwick∣shire  Yet in this Place to do her Justice she kept us to our no small  Emolument  for we grew as  good Housewives  as her  Aunt  was We all learnt to  Brew  and  fatten Hogs  and  feed Poultry  But what I found most Relishable were certain  savoury  Instructions she was so good as to communicate insomuch that I who but yesterday Morning cou'd almost as easily have made a  Horse  as a  Pudding  am to Day a Man of Learning as well in  Dishes  as their  Garnitures  I can read if I please when I meet with a Person of  good Taste  a long luxurious Lecture on

Pomatums Cold Creams  and  Cordial Waters  BUT what was still more obliging not con∣tent to have enrich'd us with this profound Knowledge she was  liberal  enough to talk on with such unceasing Rapidity that we had no Time to  thank  her till at length she saw  Ned Volatile  was preparing to take his Turn and rose and flutter'd her Fan and scudded out of the  Assembly  but we heard her Tongue running all the way down Stairs ask∣ing Questions of the Servants and answering  them herself and for any think that I know she may be  Talking to this Time  while I am penning the Narration  I AM myself too a great  Talker  only I some∣times love to  listen  and nothing is so strange to me as that since these  Pratlers  are thus trans∣ported but by too much Vivacity that very Vivacity

Aver∣sion  upon the Child of her Body  I was resolv∣ing  the other Day to form a PLAIN DEALER out of these two different Characters  METHINKS I would not miss ranging the  Deformities  of one Parent near the  Beauties  of the other because this Manner of Illustra∣tion by Opposites in Writing like  Shade  and  Light  in Painting will make the  Moral  ap∣pear with  Vigour  and strike upon the  Eye  of the  Understanding  a more forcible  Effect  COULD I execute this  Design  according to my  Wish  could I make the  Draught  just and give it the  Lively Touches  and  warm Colours  it deserves it

secret  Springs  of a Thousand little Beautiful  Actions  which would pass unnoticed by common Eyes that are too Incurious and Indelicate on such Nice and Elegant Occasions  HERE I paused a while with

the Expression which hit my Taste the best of any in your  First  PAPER was  That you would look upon yourself as every Body's Father  and I would rather see you acting like a Father than describing one which said he giving into my Hand a Paper you may do by publishing those  Verses  which according to my Opinion want nothing more than their being  Known  in order to their be∣ing  Applauded  THE Author is a Young Gentleman who tho' severe Accidents and the Rigour of For∣tune have thrown him into the Condition of an  Orphan  is still likely to prove a  Fav'rite Son  of the  Muses  But a Genius tho' never so pro∣mising will not readily make its Way into  Esteem without the Aid of a Recommender or the Encouragement of a Patron  HERE I read over the  Verses  and signified my Approbation in very few Words because I perceived the generous  Temper  of the  Ma∣jor  inclin'd him to speak further in behalf of  Unfortunate Desert  when resuming the Dis∣course he proceeded in this Manner  YOU may guess by this little Performance That those Talents which were not happy enough to procure their Possessor a Compe∣tency from  Parents  who liv'd in Affluence may if Cultivated and Improved intitle him to the  Adoption  of some great  Personage  who observing a  Noble Impartiality  with Regard to  Strangers  and  Acquaintance  may assist  Me∣rit  wheresoever he finds it It would really be pity that a Person who has demonstrated that he has a  Capacity  to entertain the  World  should not meet with a  Patron  in it to give him a  Taste  of its  Enjoyments  Whoever may be meant by  HORATIUS  if he makes as Handsome a  Figure  in his Reception of the  Poet  as he does in the  Poet  's  Description  he will be to him instead of a  Mecoenas  and you will have the Satisfaction of knowing That you put the  Meritorious  in a Way to meet  Reward  and administer an  Opportunity  the most Grateful that can be to a Person truly  Great  an  Op∣portunity  of doing a Graceful  Action  HERE a Gentleman interrupted us and left me no  Room  to make  Reply  by Word of Mouth But the best  Answer  I could since make him  was to repeat in this manner what he said and to publish the following  Lines  instead of the  Essay  I intended  To a Young Gentleman a  Painter  Occasioned by seeing his  Picture  of the  Cele∣brated CLIO  By Mr SAVAGE  FORGIVE an Artless an Officious Friend

Such living Tinctures through yon Aether glow  Stain Summer Clouds or gild the Watery Bow  She smiles she speaksshe blushes while we gaze  I hear your Colours and I feel their Blaze  More at each

Source of Likeness find  And thro' the meaning Muscles strike the Mind  Nor can one View such boundless Pow'r confine  All Nature opens to an  Art  like thine  Now Rural Scenes in simple Grandeur rise

dissimulandum quod obscurari non potest sed prae nobis ferendum trahimur omnes laudis studio optimus quisque maximè gloriâ ducitur  CICER Pro Archia Poeta  Quam multos scriptores rerum suarum magnus ille  Alexander  secum habuisse dicitur Atque is tamen cum in  Sigoeo  ad  Achil∣lis  tumulum astitisset O fortunate inquit adolescens qui tue virtutis  Homerum  praeconem inveneris verè Nam nisi  Ilias  illa extitisset idem tumulus qui corpus ejus contexerat nomen etiam obruisset  Ibidem  FRIDAY  May    THERE is a  Scantiness  in some Mens Souls that gives a distasteful Air to their very Favours and their Praises what the  Mien  is to the Body the  Temper  is to the Mind And for Want of this Observation on Occasi∣ons where it had been most useful some have lost their Friends Goodwill by an arrogant Manner of  obliging  them and others  prais'd  Men into a  Contempt  both for their Persons and their Civilities  THERE must be visible in those who wou'd say or do Things engagingly a certain Sweet∣ness in the Eye and a Sense of Pleasure in the Deportment A Compliment is an  Affront  when accompany'd with a sullen Brow or a negligent an absent or supercilious Behaviour I appeal to my Readers Whether they do not  always find themselves uneasy in the Company of a Person who seems more pleas'd with  Him∣self  than with those he is conversing with  I WAS drawn into this Reflection by read∣ing the other Day a little Copy of VERSES which is printed with some Poetical Pieces of Mr  Pope  's and was written by a Person of very great Quality and whose  Wit too  was of the first Mangnitude  On Mr POPE and his POEMS  WITH Age decay'd with Courts and Business tir'd  Caring for nothing but what Ease requir'd  Too dully Serious for the  Muses  Sport  And from the Critics safe arriv'd in Port  I little thought of launching forth agen  Amidst advent'rous Rovers of the Pen  And after so much undeserv'd Success  Thus hazarding at last to make it less  Encomiums  suit not this censorious Time  It self a Subject for Satiric Rhyme  Ignorance  honour'd  Wit  and  Worth  defam'd  Folly  triumphant and ev'n  HOMER  blam'd  But to this Genius join'd with so much Art  Such various Learning mix'd in every Part  Poets are bound a loud Applause to pay  APOLLO  bids it and they must obey  And yet so wonderful sublime a Thing  As the great  Iliad  scarce shou'd make  Me  sing  Except I justly cou'd at once commend  A good Companion and as firm a Friend  One moral or a mere wellnatur'd Deed  Does all Desert in Sciences exceed  'Tis great Delight to laugh at some Mens Ways  But a much greater to give Merit  Praise  THE good Nature of Mr  Pope  must be as Extensive as his Wit if his Esteem for this  Noble  Author was not lessen'd by so  Ignoble  a Start of his Poetry It is a grudging haugh∣ty conscious reluctant and penurious En∣comium Under Pretence of Praise to a Friend it indulges Spleen to his Enemies It carries throughout a closer Eye upon  his own  Merit than upon  His  to whom he addresses it In four and twenty Verses the four odd ones I  think  have some faint Inclination to shew Re∣spect to  another  but the twenty  I am sure  with a much stronger Bent point directly up∣on  Himself  WOULD this great Man have applauded such a POET as he ought he shou'd have forgotten or seem'd to forget both  Himself  and his  Rank  in that Reverence so justly due to an Excellence which will do Honour to our Nation He shou'd not have imagin'd himself over Bountiful in his Condescention The Praise of Mr  Pope  will be a Theme for Wit and Learning when all the  Dukes  his  Patrons  shall be  lost  in the Dust that covers them The accidental Advantages of Birth Wealth and Title are so far from bestowing Worth where they find it not originally that they serve but to make the Want of it more  obvious and contemptible whereas a  Genius  like this Gentleman's surmounts all the sha∣dowy Superiorities of Fortune adorns Dignity itself and makes Obscurity illustrious  THE great  Cardinal Richelieu  in a Circum∣stance of like Nature acted in so different a Manner that I am always charm'd afresh when I read over a Letter which he sent to  Balzac  a  French  Writer whose Merit was as inferior to Mr  Pope  's as the Grandeur of the  Prime Minister  was superior to the  Nobleman  's Let a Judgment be drawn from an impartial Comparison  A LETTER from  Cardinal Richelieu  to  Monsieur de Balzac  Paris  February  the th  SIR  THO' I have often and openly declar'd what I think of your Writings yet can∣not I satisfy my self without sending you by this Letter a more  Authentic  Approba∣tion I never had any particular Affection for your Person and since therefore it is the Prerogative of  Truth  that compels me to my Opinion I will take care That the Esteem I profess for your Works shall be no  barren Compliment  for my Praise shall be seconded by the  Applause  of a whole  People  Or if notwithstanding my Endeavours some low Spirits shall be found who may affect to think otherwise Time will make them but too sensible that the Faults they  impute to  You  are Defects in their own Judgment They are like People in the  Jaundice  who see every Thing of that dis∣temper'd Colour which themselves are af∣flicted by  IN the Days of our Ancestors Persons of narrow Understanding were implicite Ad∣mirers of what was above their Comprehen∣sion but now by a kind of  Elasticity  in modern Reason Judgment  extends  or  contracts  itself to sit close upon our  Capacity  and we approve but just as far as we are able to understand blasting every Thing by our Censure that we cannot reach by our Practice Yet I hope I do not presume too much when I say concerning your Works That  I see Things as they are  and  declare 'em  what I  see  them Your Conceptions are strong and the Flight of your Imagination outsoars every Thing but your Reason Your Language is pure and your Expression strongly Elegant  I WILL conclude with this Caution That you will be guilty in the Eye of God if you suffer such a Pen to  rest  or if you  em∣ploy  it too  idly  You ought to apply your∣self henceforward to grave and important Subjects and I am content that you shall impute to  Me  all the  Blame  if when you do so you receive not the Returns which will be due to you Already I am medita∣ting an Opportunity to be known for  Your Affectionate Humble Servant The Cardinal of  Richelieu  I AM transported while I read this Letter at the flaming Intermixture of this Statesman's lovely Qualities What a Glow of Humanity What a Consciousness of that Care which is the Duty of the  Great  to draw up Merit out of Obscurity What a Knowledge of a State's true Interest from the Force of such Examples What a genteel  Magnanimity  What a spirited Race of Sweetness does there shine in this short Letter  IT is pleasant enough to remark That both the  French  Encomium and the  English  had Effects the very Reverse of what was intend∣ed by their Authors yet at the same Time strictly consonant with  Justice  and their diffe∣rent Merits while the  English  Applauder ad∣dresses to Mr  Pope  the Praise he  means  to  Him∣self  his Verses are never read without lessen∣ing his own Character whereas the generous  French Cardinal  meaning nothing in his Let∣ter but the Encouragement of  Monsieur Bal∣zac  draws that Honour on his own Name which he wou'd bestow upon another's and becomes  Himself  the  Reader's Idol  while he is pointing him where to worship  IT was impossible for  Monsieur Balzac  after being thus nobly distinguish'd not to strain his Genius to the utmost to keep Possession of a Glory he must so justly have been Proud of whereas  Neglect  on the other Hand has dis∣courag'd a thousand Spirits which might have been capable had they been  Fortunate  or sup∣ported by those who were so to shine out  as  living Lights  and illustrate the Age they were born in thro' a long Course of Futuri∣ty  Camoens  whom the  Portuguese  call the  Virgil  of  their  Country has touch'd this Sub∣ject very happily in the th Book of his  Lusiad  HOW sweet is Praise and justly purchas'd Glory  By our own Actions when to Heaven they soar  Each noble Soul will  Strain  to leave his Story  An Overmatch for all who climb'd before  Those wond'rous Heights  Achilles  reach'd in Arms  Had ne'er so strongly mov'd the World's great Lord  Had not the Muse of  Homer  giv'n 'em Charms  And rows'd him from a  Rest  he thence abhorr'd  Scipio  's and  Caesars PORTUGAL  can boast  But has not bless'd them with exalted Hearts  Once Dead they  Die for ever  and are  lost  Because unfriended by the  deathless Arts  All those immortal Names that tread on Time  Were  learn'd themselves  or  lov'd  the learned  All  In  Greece  in  Rome  in the most  barb'rous  Clime  In every Land but tasteless  PORTUGAL  Mournful I speak it to my Country's Shame  Want of  Excitement  keeps its Genius  Low  Our rude a  boist'rous  Lords  are deaf to Fame  And seem as careless to be  known  as  know  Dull and of gross Desires their empty Pride  Dark and contracted  tastes  not what is writ  For how alas shou'd  Lameness  learn to  stride    Or he who  understands not  cherish  Wit  Blest let the Muses be by those I sing  That I for no Reward but  Honour  born  Have for my Country's Glory touch'd the String  And laugh her  titled Arrogance  to scorn  While on the Fame of  Lusitania  bent  Your Charms ye Nymphs of  Tagus  I reveal  Fortune  the Frame of my proud Hope has rent  And drags me friendless at her Chariot Wheel  Degraded at another's Board to eat  A  Rock  of  Want  surrounded by my  Woes  Ingratitude  it self unmov'd I meet  And rise the stronger against  Envy  's Blows  See Nymphs what  learned Lords  your  Tagus  boasts  What

vivere amem  IBID  MONDAY  May    MY Old Maid who has liv'd with me these thirty Years and claims the  tuck∣ing me up  as a Privilege annex'd to her  Office  left open my Windowcurtains last Night  which so early let in the Beams of the Sun upon me that I was wak'd from a Dream which I cou'd have wish'd to enjoy much longer  FANCY had remov'd all my Distance from Youth and given me back those gentle Flames which warm and brighten Life in its  Morning  I saw an adorable Object which my Soul me∣thought had once been passionately fond of And of whose Perfections I imagin'd myself to have been vertuously enamour'd But I had lost her as I fancy'd in  Death  Oh the Pain of that Imagination was terrible even in Sleep I saw this lovely Person adorn'd with all her Sweetness I heard the Musick of her Accents informing me she was  my PATTY  Now grown kinder and more sensible I even  felt  her leaning over me and found the animat∣ing Influence of her Soulenchanting Pressures With what Ecstasy of Fondness did I survey her lovely Languor Her Eyes were melting∣ly relax'd and their Beams serenely temper'd with angelick Softness and Compassion Her very  Soul  seem'd to shine upon me through the Smile of every Feature Oh how beau∣tiful is a chast Passion How sweetly does it remain upon the Mind and appeal from  Death  to the  Memory  I never knew till this dear Dream convinc'd me what I lost by not lov∣ing while my  Body  as well as my  Soul  cou'd have done Justice to the Passion  WHILE I was thus tenderly employ'd I wish some Artist cou'd have snatch'd my Pic∣ture Old as I am I flatter myself That Love  wou'd have lent it Lustre I wou'd have all my Friends who  are not  resolve immediate∣ly to commence  Lovers  The Insipids who have never  lov'd  may be said to live as the Greedy  drink  they  swallow  Life without  tast∣ing  it  BUT all transported as I was with this charming Dream it was ravish'd from me by the Sun Yet did I not  complain  It had tun'd my Soul to Harmony and transform'd me from an Old  Philosopher  into a young and hap∣py  Wanton  I started from my Bed and flew with Vigour to the Glass to which I have long accustom'd myself to creep without Transport Old and Wormeaten as it is in every Part of its broad Frame yet did it not alarm me I even saw my own Face in it without the least Mortification Nay I took Notice That my Nightcap was not so White as it ought to have been which in more unpolite Hours I shou'd have thought not worth remarking But  Love  adorns and improves us My Bo∣som swell'd with Sighs and my Eyes shone with Pleasure I brush'd up my  Mousecolour  Gloves and was wishing they had been  Yellow ones  I powder'd my short Hair and comb'd it down to look longer Nay I almost arriv'd at the Foppery of spoiling my new  Beaver  by inflicting the modern  Pinch  on it At length I remember'd That my Youth was but a  Dream  And my  PATTY  a  COQUET  My Arms at this Thought folded sadly upon my Breast I sunk into my easy Chair and was some  Minutes quite  lost  there before I cou'd recover myself How dreadful is the Descent from airy Pleasure to substantial Misery It is not to be describ'd in Prose and since  LOVE  both deserves good Poetry and can inspire it let me see what my  Muse  will say to it  Oh Lovely Object Whose dear Form I keep  In busy Daylight and in silent Sleep  Revisit Fancyto my Sighs attend  Thou  imag'd Shadow  of my Soul's soft Friend  When I recall thy Beauties to my Mind  How  dead  are all Things thou hast left behind  Study Pride Friendship languish for thy Sake  Oh Why did  Love  from thy sweet Tomb awake  Why  move  his pointed Arrows in my Breast  In Life's Descent and the cool  Vale  of  Rest  Oh charm not thus my  Soul  which is design'd  To  flow  down  Time  and strengthen Humankind  WELL My Readers shou'd think as I do that all Things are for the  Best  I lost my Dream and they find a Poet The Witlings will say a  dreaming  one But Melancholy has its Charms and I am  sweetly Sad  in the Re∣membrance of it  WHILE I was indulging this mournful Tenderness I heard a gentle Rap at my Door as if it fear'd to alarm me and the Outside of it seem'd to be swept by the rustling of Silk a Musick I am not us'd to I open'd it slow∣ly for I was still lost to myself and was ad∣dress'd by a  Lady  in a modest but most en∣chanting  Manner She appear'd to be near thirty and was dress'd very gravely a little remov'd from the present  Mode  But my Heart sprung within me For all the Beauties of my Vision were more than verify'd in this  Reality  The Soul of a  God  seem'd to stream through her Eyes And the Ideas of her Wit and Majestick Understanding  flam'd  and  sparkled  in her  meaning Softness  There was something in her Air that made the Room seem to  blaze  round her I led her to my great Chair but she gracefully declin'd it and seated herself at some Distance not to shew the Re∣spect she had to my  Age  I hope but my  Writings  After a Preface of the sweetest Praise that Vanity cou'd wish to hear she took a Paper from her Bosom and seem'd to tremble while she gave it me as if it enclo∣se'd some Declaration that her  Heart  was con∣cern'd in How becoming is  Humility  when such Excellence condescends to wear itShe withdrew and from her  Manner  I open∣ed her Paper with Impatience and found in it what follows  Good SIR  I WAIT on you with my own Letter from the Respectful Desire I have to see the Person of him whose Soul I so much admire in the PLAIN DEALER I knew very well That the Reverence you must in∣spire wou'd prevent my speaking freely and  I chose therefore to  write  what I wished to inform you of  I WAS the other Day in an Assembly of what the World calls  fine Ladies  to which gay Part of our Species I have lately been a Stranger so that I found their Dress and their Conversation entirely Foreign to me though through all Disguises I could dis∣cover the  British Beauty  The Con∣fusion of their Fans and the Loudness of their Laughter alarm'd and oppress'd my Ear as the new Situation of their Elbows drew my Eye under Astonishment One of the Ladies who I fear for her own sake is what they call a  Toast  was most lamenta∣bly delighted with a young Gentleman who sat next her and who by the Oddness of his Dress surpriz'd me more than the Ladies didHis Wig instead of gracefully adorning his Shoulders was tuck'd up into a Bag of the same  Content  with his Head and had two Wings shooting from it so that he look'd like a  Mercury revers'd  The lit∣tle Hair that escap'd this Bag because no Hat was allowed to shield it was cemented by Oil and Powder to secure it against Tempest The Sleeve of his Coat had re∣mov'd the Middle of his Arm from the Place I should have look'd for it in and  preferr'd  the Bend of his Elbow to within three Inches of his Shoulder His Stockings were so high embroider'd that they left no Shape to his  Leg And his Hands to his Fingers Ends were  entomb'd  in a Pair of Ruffles He was button'd up to the Chin in a white Dimmity Waistcoat and wore a Frock which I sup∣pose he borrow'd from one of his Grooms to emulate the  Jockey Air  with the more Ele∣gance and Propriety  AS odd a Creature as this was he seem'd to consider  Me  as an  Odder  for I overheard him whisper his fair Neighbour That by my Ill Dress and my Neglect of the Company I must be either a  Wit  or a  Tory  It was plain he said from my Behaviour that I was unlearned in the new World and he fancied for his Part that I dropt out of the  Eclipse  last  Monday  The Favourite Lady oblig'd him with a tender Look and burst into a loud Laughter I found that all his Discourse was fill'd with Arrogance and Folly and a Monster bred of both which they call  Double Entendres  At last he hum'd half a Tune danc'd a Step or two to his own Musick took  Snuff  and  Leave  to∣gether and  hopt  out of the Company  The Ladies were now at Leisure to look a little at me But their Hearts seem'd strangely full of this ridiculous Object whom they immediately fell a praising with a kind of miserable Emulation Mr  Flushcheek  said the  Toast  is sure the most delightful Crea∣ture the finest and bestbred Gentleman how witty how tender how polite and  how  severe  he is He is the Soul of Sense and Gallantry and the very Life of the  Masquerade  I started at their Admiration and felt my Heart sink into Pity for 'em while I contemplated in Silence the Perfecti∣on of my adorable  Bellario  OH Mr PLAIN DEALER that I had pro∣per Language to convey him to your Ima∣gination You wou'd then approve my Pas∣sion And I shou'd be justify'd even to your  Reason  His Person is divinely form'd Tall and Graceful His Eyes which are full of Wisdom wear a  Gentleness  as if they griev'd their own Lustre and were willing to  decline  themselves in Pity to the Beholders His Lips are rarely open'd but to  praise  or to  improve  though he has Teeth which he might be proud of shewing There is in the Turn of his Arms an inexpressible Air of Majesty I never look on him without  seeing  all the great Men I have read of I trem∣ble before him with a kind of  religious Pas∣sion  For Religion and Virtue are adorn'd by his Conversation So that I may say without Falshood that it is  Heaven  to  hear  him His Dress is disengag'd and he  knows  all Things but that he is charming Oh that you were acquainted with his Mind which is shining with every Virtue Amidst the Throng of his Beauties I forgot to tell you That he is a  Poet  a most  Divine  one Believe me it is no  Fiction  Place him there∣fore  before Mr  Flushcheek  's Eyes and con∣vert his fair Admirers for they take in the PLAIN DEALER  I am with great Respect Sir your most humble Servant  CLEORA  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Qui fit Moecenas ut nemo quam

Night after medi∣tating in my Bed on our general Dissa∣tisfaction at the Fortune that is alloted us and had again an extraordinary Dream but  very different from my last and so strongly distinct and entertaining that I flatter myself my  Readers  will be glad to share its Impression while it is new upon my Memory  I WAS plac'd I knew not how on the Top of a green Hill which was very flow'ry and fragrant The World methought lay under it in a vast Descent of Cloudiness A thousand Roads led up to it but with such intricate and mazy Windings that my Eye was unable to trace any of them distinctly Yet they all open'd at last upon the Summit of the Hill and pour'd out a mix'd Multitude of both Sexes and of all Ages and Conditions who as soon as they had reach'd the Flat hasten∣ed forward towards its Center  I WAS wonderfully pleas'd to discover  Patty Amble  in the Crowd and giving her my Hand led her on with great Composure She inform'd me That the Place we were up∣on was the  Mount of Fortune  and That she was going to a  Fair  which is held on it and call'd  Mendall Market  Her Business she said was to change her Condition for a Bet∣ter and she doubted not but I might do the same if I pleas'd since I had found my Way up the Hill For all People who came thither were allow'd the happy Privilege to lay down their own Burdens and take up lighter in the Room of them  IN the very middle of the Plain we came at length to a kind of  MayPole  which was bigger than the  Monument  and as high as the  Pike  of  Teneriff  It was of a bright  Yellow  or  Goldcolour  but twinkled strangely at a Distance and looked dazling and transparent There hung off from it all about lovely Garlands of precious Stones with a Mixture of the sweetest Flowers the  Hues  of which were  changeable  and varied every Moment with a most bewitching Delightfulness Upon the Pinacle of this Pyramid sat the Goddess of the Place very busily spinning But the Thread she twisted off was too  fine  to be seen distinct∣ly by Us who stood so far below it The Wheel in its Motion made a musical Sound but so rough and so loud that it shook the Hill all round it It scatter'd while she turn'd it a sparkling Shower of  Globules  that were manycolour'd but hollow and broke like empty Bubbles in their descending over the Multitude  WHAT I observ'd with most Concern was that the nearer we came the Prospect grew less charming for the Dust was so thick that our Eyes and Mouths were filled with it and our Heads ak'd with the Bustle and the Noise of the Tumult The Commodities which were to be barter'd for lay spread every where in Heaps and All who pass'd between were invited to come and cheapen them  Sweet∣meats Limonades  and Variety of the finest  Fruits  were offer'd diligently up and down by little  Cupids  with painted Baskets And Trumpeters Jugglers Ropedancers  MerryAndrews  and  OperaMongers  were exerting  themselves on all Sides to compleat the Up∣roar of the Market But tho' I pass'd by all their  Stages  I saw no more than  Two  whose Faces were well known to me and Those were  Heidegger  and  Doctor Faustus  IN the Front of every Pile rose an  Alabaster Pillar  whereon hung a Picture fill'd with Figures all in  Motion  representing whatever was most tempting and desirable in the Mer∣chandize it recommended And at the Foot of each Pillar was placed an  Ebony Chair  on both Sides of which stood young and beau∣tiful Women dress'd like  Muses  and  Graces  Some inviting Passengers to take Possession of the Empty Seat and others pointing up to a Compartment on the Top of it where was to be read in golden Letters the Name and Quality of the Merchandize  WE made up to a Heap that was remark∣ably higher than the Rest and read there the Word  ROYALTY  We were agreeably surpriz'd to see moving in the Picture that hung upon this Pillar  Armies Palaces  and  Navies  Crowds of Men upon their Knees and Women still more prostrateBanquets Treasures Sports and Triumphs all succeed∣ing in their Turns drew a mighty Crowd of Gazers who were struggling for the Chair and push'd each other from it  Patty Amble  was very earnest to have had  me  put in for it But I wink'd upon her to be quiet and pre∣sently we saw a Person breaking strong∣ly through the Crowd who with loud  Huzza  's and Concurrence plac'd him there and bow'd round himBut no sooner was he seated when the tempting Figures in the Picture chang'd immediately into  horrible  OnesCares Dangers Hatred Restless∣ness and a thousand  sooty Furies  roll'd un∣quietly about him The  Muses  and  Graces  were transform'd into  Serpents  and  Satyrs  that hiss'd grinn'd and pointed at him And when he wou'd have gladly escap'd and sprung out of the Chair he found himself held down in it by a Troop of  meagre Phan∣toms  that frighted us away from any further Observation of him  THE next Place that we stopp'd at was the Column of BEAUTY We look'd up to the Picture and saw moving in it a mix'd and confus'd Bustle of Coaches Footmen and Coronets Men with their Hearts in their Hands and an indistinct Cavalcade of shape∣less Things without Heads call'd Smiles Sighs Vows Desires Faintings Languishments and Adorations There came up to this Place in great Hurry a fat but sprightly Young Woman with a Bundle under her Arm which she laid down by Way of Bar∣ter and which we observ'd as she sorted the Goods to be fill'd with large Legs red Hair brown Skin big Breasts and SmallPoxMarks in abundance The Attendants at the Pillar having agreed to the Exchange were inviting her into the  Ebony  Chair when I who by this Time began to suspect their fair Appear∣ance  turn'd  the Picture with my  Stick  and expos'd its other Side to the  SheMerchant  which was to be Part of her Bargain and con∣sisted of Scandal Spleen Jealousy Anguish Perjury and Ruin She no sooner saw the Faces of this ugly Nest of Monsters but snatching up her own Bundle she ran as fast as her thick Legs cou'd carry her tumbling Head over Heels at every Heap in her Way and getting up as she best cou'd without staying to look behind her  WHILE we were diverting ourselves at this pleasant Flight a Person whom Nature had design'd and limb'd for a  PLOWMAN  had been seiz'd with an Ambition to be made a  Minister of State  and having thrown down his Burden of Toil Penury and Dirtiness be∣fore the Pillar of POWER had seated himself triumphantly in the Chair at the Foot of it but was frighted out of his Wits by that time we came up to him for we found him al∣most smother'd under an unmerciful Load of Slanders Terrors Axes and Halters which he had much ado to crawl out from and was bawling with great Earnestness and Distortion of Muscles to have his  Own Goods  restor'd him  IN the next Compartment we examin'd we found written the Word TITLES We saw there a Beau with six Footmen behind him very earnestly perusing the moving Trophies in the Picture My  Coquet  felt her Heart beat at the Sight of so fine a Gentleman and whis∣per'd  her Opinion That I need not turn  that  Picture for sure there was no  Ill  to be ap∣prehended  there  I did it however and the Beau fell into Fits at the sudden rushing out of a Whirlwind of Ignorance Conceited∣ness Scorn Luxury and Diseases  I frighted an honest Citizen in much the same Manner from the Standard of WEALTH He had taken a Fancy for Preferment and was wishing extremely to be erected into an  Alderman  He had counted out for the Pur∣chase a Lifefull of Ease a small Parcel of Understanding and  Ditto  of Conscience But the very Minute I turn'd the Picture there flew into his Face Dullness Cuckoldom and Clumsiness upon which he took to his Heels and left his  own Bag  behind him  AT the Column of WIT I was agreeably entertain'd among a large Circle of  Gapers  who were admiring the wonderful  Mechanism  of the Picture that was hung upon that PillarCities Mountains Oceans Woods Skies Meadows Gardens Gods and Goddesses Gi∣ants Mermaids Cupids Dragons Mistresses Witches Enchanted Castles Fields of Air and Seas of Fire all delightfully intermix'd and confounded rose and charm'd the Obser∣vationBut the Crowd dispers'd immedi∣ately on my discovering to their great Ter∣ror and Amazement that there lurk'd behind all this Gaiety a  lean  Society call'd Envy Malice Poverty Dependence and Calamity  I WALK'D quite through the  Fair  and whereever I wander'd perceived it was in all Parts alike They who brought  Complaints  to exchange against  GoodFortune  chose to carry their  own  back again rather than con∣clude a  New  Bargain There was something in every Heap that they were inclinable enough to purchaseBut there was some∣thing too that must go with it which they could not bear to be troubled with so they went murmuring away and bestow'd their Curses in great Plenty on the Goddess who kept the Market which was never the thinner notwithstanding for still new Crowds sup∣ply'd the Places of those who return'd dis∣satisfy'd Nor cou'd the Warnings they met with from such Numbers who had been dis∣appointed prevail with these new Comers to believe they shou'd go back again without being the Richer from a  Mart  that was stor'd so plentifully with all that the World calls Valuable  AMONG the infinite Variety of Temptati∣ons which glitter'd every where about me I was in Danger but once and That was at the Pillar of FAME I saw when I turn'd that Picture that the Weight of the Counterbalance lay chiefly in these four Evils  Death Time Detraction  and  Uncertainty  Yet so strong was my Desire to float my Name through Futurity that I was resolutely deter∣min'd to take Possession of the ChairBut having Nothing of Value about me but my  Oaken Stick  and  Mousecolour'd Gloves  the first of which they refus'd because of the Mischief it had done 'em in turning up the wrong Sides of their Pictures and the Second be∣cause not  fine  enough to be fashionable in that Region I was forc'd upon an Expedient which I am almost afraid to confess for fear of losing for ever the Good Opinion of my Female Readers  TO say all in a Word I was heroically resolv'd to give up my  Love  for my  Glory  so taking  Patty Amble  by the Hand I prof∣fer'd  Her  in Barter having no  Other Com∣modity  The Attendants who watch'd the Pillar were just ready to take hold of her when she threw her Arms about my Neck and  conjur'd  me by all the Tyes of Honour and of Gallantry that I wou'd not leave her a Sa∣crifice to so empty a Divinity as the Regent of that Mountain She begg'd that I wou'd return with her to the Lower but happier World and whatever I should ask of her she wou'd grant me by Way of Recompence I took her suddenly at her Word and ask'd her  Heart  for a  Fairing  Nay spare me but that One Thing said she with a languishing Re∣proachfulness and take  any thing else about me  Unfortunately overjoy'd at this Bliss which methought befel me the sudden Flow of my Spirits under a Sense of the promis'd Transport caus'd so violent an Agitation that waking on a sudden I dropt out of her Arms and per∣ceiv'd myself in my Bed in  Barbican  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites  Et vitulâ tu dignus hic  VIR  MONDAY  May    I PASS some agreeable Hours now and then at the House of  Sir Portly Rufus  an old and wealthy Acquaintance who lives a few Miles out of Town and having got his Estate by a long and busy Life spent in Trading adventurously to most Parts of the World is now retir'd from its Hurry and enjoys it with a graceful Ease and unde∣signing Hospitality The only Inconvenience I have to complain of when I am with him is that the Company I meet there is not so Delicate as I cou'd wish it but mix'd with that Ineligance which must be expected and submitted to among Men of Business whose Friendships are form'd for the most Part not on Sympathy of Minds but mutual Commerce of Interests  YET as there is always something to be  learnt  from the most inconsiderable Accidents we can meet with I never return'd from Dine∣ing or Supping with my good Friend  Sir  Portly  but I brought away with me as strong a Proof as I cou'd any where have met with That the Reason why in mix'd Com∣panies we seldom find much Pleasure is be∣cause every Person not under some immediate Guard of  Hope Fear  or  Reverence  keeps only  Himself  in View And directs his Dis∣course and Behaviour  not  to the Taste of those he shou'd Entertain but to the parti∣cular Bent of his own Humour or Capacity  ONE of the most constant Guests at  Sir Portly  's is  Tony Gingle  his Sister's Son who has a great Genius for Poetry He makes very good Verses and pronounces gracefully enough those he repeats from other Writersso far all is well But the worst of it is that  Tony  has studied nothing  but  Poetry He is quite dark in the useful Doctrine of Times Seasons and Places It is the same Thing to  him  when the Muse  bites  whether he quotes Tragedy to a Man of Letters his Taylor's Wife or a Stockjobber The Chimes of his Numbers are for ever ringing in his Fancy And all who chance to sit near him must have their Share of the Melody He has taken it into his Head that because  he  can make a considerable Figure  as a Poet  there is nothing considerable  but Poetry  And it is a very pleasant Scene to observe  Tony  studying at one of the Tables of a full CoffeeHouse in the midst of the City scanning Verses on his Fingers Conceiving writing and blotting out And humming them over to himself  with all the Rapture and Gesticulation of  Tone Action  and  Passion  Regardless that he is star'd at and remark'd all the while by a dozen or two of thriving Citizens who shake their Heads and  pity  him as a Man that has  lost  his  Wits  even while he is under the  Ope∣ration  of being  Witty  He has never per∣mitted his Brain to grow cool enough to re∣flect That  Wit  in dull Company is the dullest Subject in the World and that it is a Folly to talk of  Homer Horace  or  Pope  among Grave Fellows within  Ludgate  who when they hear of a Great Poet will tell you a Story of  Tom Brown  and feel no Difference in the Power of  Tony Gingle  's own Works and the humble La∣bours of their  Bellman  Jack Juniper  the Apothecary and  Tom Tiresome  the Haberdasher living both in the same Street ride down together twice a Week to take a Bottle with my Friend  Sir Portly    Jack Juniper  reads us Lectures on the new Improvements in  Botany  and the Rise and Progress of  Inoculation  which are accurately answer'd by Mr  Thomas Tiresome  with the Price of the  Stocks  and the Mournful Decay of the  Spittlefields Weaving  As soon as this very able Apothecary has open'd and ex∣plain'd to us the  Circulation of the Blood  the punctual Haberdasher repays his Kindness with the  Course of Exchange  If some  Patient  of the One has taken  Physick  for her  Complexion  some Lady who is the Other's Customer has with equal Advantage to her Skin fallen into  the Wear of his new  BlushColour  But in the very Heighth of their  Elucidations Tony Gingle  never fails to  wedge in  between 'em both some six Dozen of Quotations from a Poem call'd the  Dispensary  though the intel∣ligent Mr  Juniper  is continually interrupting him with the  true History  of every weighty Occurrence in  ApothecariesHall  which pro∣vok'd the Muse of the merry  Doctor  While poor  Tom Tiresome  when he has yawn'd and listen'd in vain to the full Extent of his Pa∣tience for an Opportunity to grow Eloquent on the Use of  ColchesterBays  falls asleep in his Chair and  snores  at us in Revenge to maintain his Part in the Conversation  HONEST  Sir Portly  wou'd be often at a Loss to shape such stubborn  Obliquities  into any  direct Line  of Society if he had not al∣ways at his Elbow the goodnatur'd Mr  William Weathercock  a Gentleman Farmer in his Neighbourhood who has a large but empty UnderstandingThe Mind of  Will Weathercock  is like the Sail of a great Ship that has  Room  to contain much Wind but hav∣ing none of its own producing is swell'd out by Turns from all the Quarters of the Com∣pass  Will  hits every Man's Taste and is of all People's Opinion He is so desirous to  Oblige  that there is not a Point in the  Circum∣ference  but wou'd serve him for a  Center  He is this Moment in  your  Sentiment and the  next  will before your Face be of his Opinion who contradicts you But if a Third  affirms you  Both  to have been in the Wrong and appeals to  Will Weathercock    Will  with the bestbred Agility in the World shifts immediately to  his  Side too and thinks it as clear as the Sun that You were  All Three  in the Right of it  THIS pliable Ductility in the Reason of  Will Weathercock  hitches in and chains toge∣ther the most repugnant Idea's and uniting them into an active Body like the  hook'd Atoms  of  Des Cartes  gives 'em Strength Fluidity and Consequence Such a lively Effect have the very  Weaknesses  of Humanity beyond the Force and Subtlety of IllNature and SelfInterest  Tony Gingle  the last Time that I saw this Company together was so put to it for an Opportunity to repeat some Verses he was  big with  that in order to  bring 'em in  with a tolerable Appearance of Propriety he began to compliment  Sir Portly  's Lady on the Fine∣ness of her Shape and Skin and inferring from their being Praiseworthy that they should lie open to Observation took Occasion by these Lines to enforce his kind Opinion that it was necessary for her to  go naked  Can Forms like yours want Ornament of Dress  Beauty like  Truth  shines most in  Nakedness  Dressing may skreen Deformities from View  But even Adornment does but  shadow you  Most but by what they wear are lovely made  You Madam  lose  whene'er you seek such Aid  While others dress their Lovers Hearts to warm  You  put off  nothing but what  veil'd  a Charm  THE Lady blush'd and smil'd  Sir Portly  laugh'd aloud and begg'd to hear 'em over again For my Part I was doubly pleas'd with the Turn of the Verse and Particularity of the Fancy  Tony Gingle  himself was in Raptures which he cou'd not hide at the Applause his Muse had met withBut  Tom Tiresome  had been weighing with the Foresight of a prudent Citizen the Ill Consequence of  going naked  to his good Friends the  Weavers  and felt a commendable Indignation against the tuneful Mr  Gingle  insomuch that in the Heat of his Resentment he call'd him  Madman  and  BalladSinger  Pray what do you sup∣pose said he wou'd become of many thou∣sand honest People who live by making  Pet∣ticoats  and what  belongs  to Petticoats if all handsome Women were to go  impudently Na∣ked  Out upon it Methinks I  see  'em and am asham'd of you It is scandalous and in∣decent and to say nothing of the  Plot  which may lie conceal'd in it against  Trade  it is the Whim of a  Heathen Turk  and not fit to be thought of in a  ChristianCountry  TONY  by this Time had fathom'd the  Depth  of his Antagonist and began to play upon him from his Batteries of poetical Ar∣tillery the War was growing hot and threa∣tened dangerous Consequences when  Will Weathercock  put in between 'em and taking  Part with the  Wit  because he observ'd him to be a Favourite made this Charge upon his Opposite like a brave and faithful Auxiliary  YOU are certainly in the right most divert∣ing Mr  Gingle  Nature never wou'd have cover'd Women with such white and tempt∣ing Skins if she had not meant 'em for a pub∣lick Ornament The Ladies are Nature's Fa∣vourites and can we suppose her to have been less liberal to those  Favourites  than to the  Beasts  which she plac'd below 'emShe never sent us a  Calf  but he came into the World with his  Coat  on An  Ox  has no  Breeches  to pull off when he goes to Bed weary The  Lamb  is born ready dress'd with her Freeze Coat about her And who ever saw a  Sow  drawing off her Shoes and StockingsNone sleep softer than the  Birds  do Yet they rise in the Morning with their Feather∣beds upon their BacksThe most Excel∣lent of the  Virtues  are always painted like  Women  but it is like  Women without Cloaths on  And what does this mean but to insinu∣ate to the Sex that all who love Virtue shou'd despise HoopPetticoats and  go naked  There is this manifest Absurdity in Wo∣mens Dressing that it involves them in Per∣plexities which make the chief End they dress for much more difficult than it need be For as they order the Matter they are to be taken to Pieces like  Watches  before a Man can come  near  enough to examine the  Wonders  of  their  Workmanship    Fashions  differ in all Nations and what is a fine Dress in one Place is a frightful one in another But were Women once uncover'd all Mens Judg∣ments wou'd agree about 'emIn a Word since the  Sun Moon  and  Stars  appear as Na∣ture has made 'em since all  Animals  are satis∣fy'd with their own natural Figures and since the  Roses  are not asham'd to shew their  Thorns  with their  Beauties  why shou'd  Woman  Na∣ture's Masterpiece seek to hide or disguise her Loveliness  WILL  went eloquently on after this ex∣traordinary Manner till he had fully con∣vinc'd and satisfy'd all that Part of his Au∣dience who were on this first Side the Question But casting his Eye on poor  Tom Tiresome  and pitying the melancholy Air with which he listen'd to an Opinion he had not Wit enough to argue against though he thought it little Better than Fornication and Adultery  Will  in simple Honesty of Heart and out of a mere Motive of Compassion slipt by a very sudden Transition into a sure Method of comforting him and chang'd his  Level  as follows  YET I must do Justice to both Arguments and it seems plain beyond Contradiction that Beauty was  made  to be  ornamented  The Pea∣cock's  starry Tail  shews that Nature loves gay Fancies  Nature  dress'd the Hills and the Meadows in their fine embroider'd Man∣tles  It was  she  that spangled over all that glorious  Veil  of HeavenWho but  Na∣ture  spotted the  Ermin  And  gilt  the scaly Skins of Fishes and of Serpents  Man  indeed she sent into the World plain and nakedNot that she meant he shou'd  remain  sobut because she  adorn'd  all Things else for his  Reason  to chuse a Dress from What is the Silkworm but Nature's little  Spinster  set to Work for our common Benefit The very  Spider  keeps a  Loom  and weaves a finer Manufacture than the Artists of  SpittleFields  canWhy smell these love∣ly Flowers round the SummerHouse we are sitting in so delightfully sweet and fragrant but to teach us That we shou'd  perfume  our selves And to what End can we suppose they were made so various in their Colours but to give Ladies the happy Hint of employ∣ing  Dyers  and  Silkweavers  TOM TIRESOME  broke in upon him at those two inspiring Words with a loud and triumphant  Hollow  and filling instantly  two Bumpers  drank Prosperity to  Trade  and Health and Happiness to Mr  Weathercock  His Toasts went round the Company and both Parties were so well satisfied with the Share each had in his Decision that Neither of them appear'd shock'd at the manifest Contradicti∣on of his Reasoning But  Tony Gingle  went away the most pleas'd of the Two because  Sir Portly  desir'd him at parting to repeat his Verses the third Time and to make an∣other  Copy against next Meeting on the com∣fortable use of  Swanskin Breeches  to Ladies who wear Wide Hoops in a sharp and frosty Winter  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Tum pater Anchises lachrymis ingressus obortis  O nate ingentem luctum ne quaere tuorum  Ostendent terris hunc tantum fata ne{que} ultrâ  Esse sinent  VIR  Heu miserande puer Si qua fata aspera rumpas  Tu Marcellus eris  Ibid  Discite justitiam moniti non temnere divos  Ibid  FRIDAY  May    SIR  YOU observed very justly in one of your late Papers that no Figure in Life can be more graceful and amiable than that of a wise and good Father with Respect to an only Son who possesses and deserves his Indulgence  THAT Lover of Mankind  Hortensius  gave us lately a fine Example of the Force of this Truth But I look back upon it with Anguish because I judge of his present  Pain  by the Excess of his past  Pleasure  THO'  Hortensius  had properly but one Son he was in some Sense the  Common Fa∣ther  Nothing ever was carried higher than the  Manliness  of his Heart except its  Sweetness  and  Humanity  For he was soften'd by the benevolent Overflowings of a Pity that touch'd him at once in the two  Extremes  of Sensibi∣lity His own  Joys  were damp'd by other Peoples  Afflictions  and his private  Sorrows  chear'd by the  Prosperity  of those who hated himHe not only  forgave  readily the most malicious of his Enemies but that he might be sure to do it generously he  forgot  the very  Injuries  Even his  Faults  were no other than the unsuccessful Result of his  Virtues  for act∣ing rather by the measure of his  Mind  than of his  Power  he provok'd the Disappointed to whom the  Will  is no  Obliger  His  Wit  could fear no Rivals but his  Courage  and his  Honesty  And every Person who shall read this  faint  Character of his Excellence has been oblig'd by the  Effects  of it with regard to the Pub∣lick Interest and the Ornaments of Society  SUCH  was Hortensius  and such  Horten∣sius is  if yet he may be said to  be  after the Death of that dear  Son  he  liv'd in  and into whose fine Mind he had pour'd out and trans∣fus'd all the Fullness of his Virtues with a kind of Hope in  him  and  his  to have im∣mortaliz'd his very  Body  and to receive from future Ages in the Honours paid to his De∣scendants the Tribute of that  Praise  which his own declining Life is now too scanty to make Room for  HE who knows the Father's Prospect and how suddenly  Death  has blasted it having snatch'd away the Son when just blooming into Manhood and already the  Companion  and the  Friend  of his Father never look'd on without Joynever oblig'd without Gratitudenever thought on without Ten∣dernessnever hearken'd to without Won∣der must be touch'd with a lively Sense of what that Fate brought with it which  tore  from such a Parent who before had lost the Mother such a Son to leave him  joy∣less  with the  future  World before him like a bleak and barren  Desart  And the  past  more dreadful still by a thousand goading Tendernesses which cling for ever to the Me∣mory and torment and sting Reflection  WHAT is Life when we consider it under the Accidents it is liable to but an unresting Conflict in the Dark with Labours Doubts and DisappointmentsOne such Loss as  Hortensius  has sustain'd in this lov'd Son and so felt too as  Hortensius  feels it serves for ever to imbitter  Hope  and draws Gloom enough over the Mind to put a Stop to our wild Pursuits of Riches Power and Reputa∣tion  WHEN I compare the present Calamity of this Gentleman with the Satisfaction he is fallen fromwith that ripening Expectati∣onthat observing Vigilance that unspeak∣able Succession of little Transports and tender Triumphsand all that Train of  Noble  Weaknesses  which warm and open the human Heart upon these dear and soft Occasions I confess to you that I am  lost  in too quick a Sense of his MiseryAnd I tremble while I learn from it that we are expos'd to it most danger∣ously on that strongest and unguarded Quarter whence we look for our  sincerest Happiness  I MET  Hortensius  some time since and letting down my Glass by Accident just as his Chair was passing me my Soul was wound∣ed through my Eyes at the moving Majesty of his SorrowHe endeavour'd to have skreen'd it behind the Greatness of his Spirit and put me in Mind when I was gone by him of this fine and natural Stroke in  Shake∣speare  She never  told  her Pain  But let  Concealment  like a  Worm  i'the  Bud  Prey on her Damask Cheek  seem'd  all unmov'd  And satlike  Patience  on a  Monument  Smiling  at Grief  IF a Man who had embark'd himself for some long Voyage with his Friends and his whole Family shou'd have the  miserable  De∣liverance to escape alone from a Shipwreck and be thrown ashore upon some barren Island whence he cou'd discern no Object round him but the Swelling of the Sea while it was cover∣ing the sinking Heads of all who were  near  or  dear  to him and to preserve whose che∣rish'd Lives he wou'd himself have dy'd with  PleasureCould such a  dreadful Distinction  be consider'd as a Blessing to himOr shou'd we not rather pity him as the Person of the whole Number whose Lot was least supportable And to which a thousand  Deaths  were preferable  YET methinks Mr  PlainDealer  tho' to lose a Worthy Son must be acknowledg'd a  trying Misery  It is a Fate severer still to be the Father of an  Unworthy  one  And live to  feel  How sharper than a  Serpent  's  Tooth  it is  To  have a thankless Child  Shakespeare  in  King Lear  SHEW me a Good Man whose paternal Care has been rewarded with Contempt from the ungrateful Object of his TendernessWho sees his Name disgrac'd by the sordid Quali∣ties of an  Heir  from whose expected Excel∣lence he had promis'd himself an Encrease to its ReputationWho lives convinced that he is hated avoided and wish'd  dead  by a Wretch whom he has given  Life  to and from whose Virtues he had flatter'd himself that his Old Age wou'd find a Comfort and his Memory retain a Glory  Such a Father  shall look with a kind of Envy on  Horten∣sius  and be the only Person capable of weigh∣ing his Distress without Agony  THE Impartiality of Time and Reason placing in the same Degree of  Fame  those  who polish'd and instructed Nations with those who govern'd or conquer'd them  Hortensius  need not blush to see his Name rank'd with  Princes  I will therefore instance an Example of a vaster Misery than his own in the  greatest Monarch  of our Age why did I not say  of any Age  I mean the  Czar  of  Russia  A Prince whose Actions will draw after him a Blaze of Glory and Astonish∣ment through the latest  Depth  of  Time  and warm the Hearts of Posterity with the same generous Reverence for the Name of this im∣mortal Emperor which we now feel at men∣tion of  Alexander the Great  or the first and noblest of the  Caesars  THERE can be very few of your Readers who have not heard the  Czar  accus'd of one of the most shocking Kinds of  Cruelty  with regard to the Death of his Son the late  Prince Royal  But most of 'em I believe are igno∣rant that this great and generous Sovereign was so free from the Guilt of that illground∣ed Imputation that he pardon'd his Condemn'd Son in Person in the most tender and move∣ing Manner after he had been  sentenc'd to Death  not by the  Czar himself  but by a Con∣vention of the  Senate  and  States  of  Russia  EcclesiasticalCiviland Militaryfor having to use the very Words of the Sentence  Form'd a Design to get the Crown even in the Lifetime of his Father opposing and under∣mining all his glorious Improvements and soli∣citing Insurrections of Rebels at Home and  the Assistance of a Foreign Army to accomplish the Destruction of them  I COU'D produce the most authentic and undeniable  Evidences  that throughout the whole Course of this great and private Affli∣ction the  Czar  discover'd more of the  Vast∣ness  the  Humanity  and the  Firmness  of his  Soul  than in all the Publick  Torrent  of his Dangers and his VictoriesAnd I think I may challenge the most partial Admirers of  Antiquity  to produce any Thing so humane so heroic so  Godlike  as this  Letter  even from their greatest and most honour'd Cha∣ractersIt was writ and deliver'd by the  Czar  's own Hand to the Prince Royal his Son on the th Day of  October  in the Year  Extract of a  LETTER  from the  Czar  of  Russia  to his Son the Prince  Alexei  My SON  YOU cannot be ignorant since it is known to all the World to what Degree our People groan'd under the  Swedish  Oppres∣sion We saw by the Loss of our  Maritime Provinces  that we were cut off from all Com∣merce with the rest of the World You know too what it cost us in the Begin∣ning of this War to qualify ourselves to give a Check to so implacable a Violence But God led us by the Hand till we were wor∣thy in our Turn to make that Enemy trem∣ble  before whom others had long trem∣bledWe owe this next to God to our own unwearied Toil and the Affection of our  Best Children  our faithful  Russian Sub∣jects  BUT if while I am viewing this Prospe∣rity of my Native Country I turn an Eye to  my own Posterity  my Heart is oppress'd with  Grief  that is too heavy for my  Glory  I see  You  my Son rejecting all the Means of becoming able to protect or govern what I  leave  youYou will not so much as hear of  Warlike Study  tho' by  that only  we broke out of the Obscurity we were in∣volv'd in and made ourselves  notic'd  among Nations  I DO not exhort You to  make War  with∣out  Reason  I but press you to learn the  Art  of it I cou'd place before your Eyes many  Proofs  that this is necessary But I will name the  Greeks  only for they are united in the same  Faith  with usWhat but Neglect of  Arms  was the Occasion of their Ruin Rest and Idleness had weaken'd them till they cou'd  submit  even to  Slavery  You mistake if you think it enough for a Prince to have  Good Generals  Men look up to the  Head  They examine  his  Inclinations that they may conform themselves to his  Genius  My Brother in his

which must be held out to the Eyes of the  Unworthy  You will see and hear for ever with the Eyes and Ears of  others  and resem∣ble a young  Bird  that holds out its  Bill  to its  Feeder  I AM a

often have I reproach'd You Nay sometimes you have compell'd my Affection even to  punish  youFor some Years past I have scarce spoke to youYet all this avail'd nothingIt was  losing  my  Time  It was  striking  the  Air  All your Pleasure consists in Indo∣lence Things of which you ought to be asham'd because they make you contempti∣ble compose your  dearest Delight  Nor  do you concern yourself for the Consequen∣ces it may produce to your Country  AFTER having weigh'd in my secret Breast the fatal Tendency of your Proceed∣ingsAfter having reflected how long  in vain  I have endeavour'd to

have been Indulged in their Propensities to talk and enjoyed their Humour and Pleasan∣try nay they have been permitted to break in upon one another sometimes with unex∣pected Vollies of Raillery which might per∣haps have been carried to unwarrantable Lengths and attended with ill Consequences if they had not been overawed by the Presence of us of a more sedate Turn and sometimes seasonably parted by the Interposition of the  Major  and timely relieved from one another in those brisk Onsets  IF an Account of the little Infirmities of this pair of Scufflers has had its proper Tendency towards the Cure of any  noted Impertinents  of either Sex who have a Flux in their Tongues I shall not think that I have as yet offended the Gravity of my Character or lost any Time in penning down such Levities the Know∣ledge of which rightly convey'd produces Consequences of so much Importance to the Quiet and Repose of the more serious part of the Human Species Thus far I can say from what has fallen within my own Observation That several gay Parts which I have dis∣cover'd of the Conversation between  Ned  and the  Coquette  have excited an unusual Vein of Merriment among many of my young Readers but tho' I must confess I had a secret  Plea∣sure  in finding them  pleased  I should have been delighted in a more exquisite Degree if my Writings taking a better Effect had stir'd up in some of them whom it wou'd have become a little more  SelfReflection  and  less Laughter  They who only laugh at the Follies of others give me the worst half of their Ap∣plause I shall never be compleatly pleas'd till I can teach them to laugh at themselves they think me a pleasant and facetious old Fellow but I wou'd be at the same Time a useful and a profitable Companion  I LATELY saw the most penetrating pair of Eyes that ever shone upon Paper very busily employed upon that  PlainDealer  wherein I described the last TongueSkirmish between  the  Two Talkatives  of our  Assembly  She read it to herself and ever now and then laugh'd out heartily I could guess by observing her Eye what Passages tickled her the most and found 'em to be those which threw the for∣ward Humour of the two Combatants into the strongest Pitch of Ridicule I was in hopes That if any of that Female Infirmity which she so heartily laugh'd at in others fell to her Share she would ever after carefully avoid appearing in the same Light in which she had seen her Neighbour make so ungraceful a Figure and whom she confess'd by such  sen∣sible Signs  to be a proper Object of Ridicule But to my very great Wonder she no sooner laid the Paper out of her Hands but she in∣continently exercised those Lips with ten times more Velocity in  Talking  than they seem'd to have in the  Course  of their  Reading  Her Tongue outgallop'd the  Coquette  's and I am persuaded if  Ned Volatile  had been to start with her upon equal Terms she would fairly have distanced  him  he would have lost Sight of her in the first Flight Up got I no Room being given to take Leave and march∣ed off as fast as my Oakenstick would help me and have been mightily discouraged to see the little Effects of my PerformancesI warrant this Gossip told the next Company she fell into That she read my  Paper  and the Moment after in utter Contempt of the Moral palpably contained in it bolted away into numberless Fooleries and as many Imperti∣nences  as before But can this pert FairOne be properly said to have  read  the PLAINDEALER No she  saw  it but did not  read  it At this Rate I must be obliged to turn  Lecturer  upon my own Works and where there are any genteel Hints substitute rougher and coarser in their Room that they may not be too deli∣cate and escape Observation It is the Sign of a wellmanner'd Writer just to touch upon the Verge of a severe Truth and leave the rest to a Reader's private Meditation But if this Method proves ineffectual it is next to impos∣sible to preserve the Character of a PLAINDEALER without saying something that may penetrate more violently I shall therefore for the Future without Scruple declare that any Eyes let them appear never so beautiful which at once look over and overlook these Papers are in a Manner as bad as blind and that the only Grace in beautiful Lips which are almost always in Motion and scarce ever to the Purpose consists in the Propriety of their Colour which shews as if they blush'd with a Sense of their own Impertinence  THE Gentlemen run over my Papers as well as the Ladies without reading them They conceive a Jest on some particular Per∣son then laugh and become more a Jest themselves yet will not consider till they are told in plain Terms that each of them is that  particular Person  THE odd Spark whom my Correspondent fair  Cleora  very properly liken'd to a  Mercury  Reversed  is the same odd Spark he was and what is worse has since that Time brought over Hundreds of Proselytes to the same silly Fashion so that one would be apt to imagine there is nothing more wanting to make a Dress very popular but shewing it first to be very ridiculous There seems to be a general Emulation among the FashionMongers which of them can be the most Whimsical as the on∣ly sure Way to be the most Taking and Suc∣cessful  THESE  Mercuries  consist mostly of your Sma  t Dapper Blades tho' some very tall Men have condescended to come into the Fa∣shion which makes them appear to have no Heads at all or as if half the Head lay hid in the Bag behind it  IT is an extraordinary Entertainment to see the whole  Mall  crowded with this kind of Pup∣pets and yet more so when examining these Childish Figures you read in their Faces that they generally consist of Persons from Five and Twenty to upwards of Forty Years of Age Some Fops of Fiftyodd make the first Decays of Age remarkable in them by this Dress which would be otherwise unnoticed A jolly old Friend of mine was taking an Airing with me in the Park the other Day  'What must be in these Peoples Minds  said he  that in order to look Gay appear Hoary like the Pictures of  Old Winter  when every Thing looks flourishing about them The very Breezes blow to refresh them and sweep  away the Load of Dust which wou'd swel∣ter them if they had not ingeniously prevent∣ed it by a Cement of OrangeButter  CAN any of these Sparks  pretend  to read my Papers who without looking into their Minds continue to cultivate the Outside of their Heads after such a prodigious and pre∣posterous Rate As to the Powderers of Fifty I must tell them that even I who am in my grand Climacterick and have gone thro' the Snow of so many Winters am not half so much powder'd as they and that therefore it cannot look decent in them  IF we survey from the Head downwards every Part of their Dress there is not one but what is preposterous  IF a Man for Example was to take a Re∣view of the Officers and Soldiers provided they had Sleeves of the Modern Cut he would take them for an Army of Invalids The Company of  Taylors  seem to have forgot them∣selves and want the Assistance of the  BarberSurgeons  to instruct them in the Rules of Ana∣tomy without which the Elbows of Men are visibly out of Joint and can never be set cle∣verly  THE young Fellows have drop'd down the Flaps of their Coats very near as Low as the Clocks of their Stockings so that scarce any thing of the Leg is to be seen but Ancle and they seem to be pulling them still lower and lower that they may be more and more like Petticoats which the Women are grate∣fully  tucking up shorter and shorter that there will be a decent Necessity for converting them into  Breeches  BUT I observe that the Ladies go openbreasted in  Winter  tho' the Dappers button up to the Chin in  Summer  and have garnished the Folds of their Coats with Supernumerary Buttons the Use of which I cannot possibly learn tho' I have applied to those who are very deeply read I would propose Buttons and Buttonholes down the Seam of the Back that they may be button'd up to the Poll as they are to the Chin which will be of great Use when they are lazy for they may be unbutton∣ed as Ladies are unlac'd  behind  by a Servant  IF these Alterations should be carried on a little further my Friend  Gunter  's Predictions concerning the Mutation of Sexes must be al∣lowed to be punctually verified  WHAT I most fear is lest our Merchants and others whose Affairs have kept them ma∣ny Years beyond Sea shou'd be surprized at their Return to find us dress'd after the pre∣sent Mode hear our Officers sing  Italian  our Beaus compliment one another in  High Dutch  our old Women talk Politicks in  French  and not believe us to be the same Generation of Peo∣ple they left behind them in this Island  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Sed tamen amoto quaeramus seria ludo  HOR  In facinus jurasse putes  OVID  O pulchra ista pars quae actiones vitam{que} bene format ac diriget  TACIT  FRIDAY  June    IT has been remark'd in the  Course  of these PAPERS that among the  Wise  there are none more  Foolish  than the  Witty  May it not with great Truth be said That among the merely  Witty  none are more  ridiculed  than the  Wise  If a  Clergyman  offers to speak the  Witlings  foretel  Dullness  BUT the Case is quite otherwise with Per∣sons of a serious Cast of Thought who know that as  Truth  is the only Mean by which  Divines  can surely instruct so their  Stile  must be peculiarly clear which without stopping at  Brightness  pursues  Solidity  I am therefore fully satisfy'd that that Grave Class of my  Readers  whom I count doing me an Honour when I see them clap on their Spectacles to read my  Works  as if they thought they could meet with Improvement from them after their  own long Experience of the  World  will be pleased with the following  Discourse  which the  Clergyman  made the other Day upon that  Virtue  call'd  PlainDealing  WHEN we consider that every Body said he is continually recommending the  Subject  of your  Papers  in common Conversation one would think there was little need for a Writer to employ his Time upon it But when we reflect how few practise it  no Subject  requires more  Pains  to inforce it People praise it every  Day  and violate it every  Hour  and  common Honesty  like  common Sense  is boldly pretended to by  every Body  but really pos∣sessed by  few  IT must be worth a little of our  Meditation  to inform ourselves how this  Quality  comes to be so Valuable among us and yet we so frequently and so easily part with it in short by what  Mystery  in our  Conduct  such Numbers of Men would appear to be what they are not  WE see upon the first Moment's Reflection that PLAINDEALING is the  Soul  of  Friendship  it is the necessary  Essence  of it and when that is once gone the most warm and lively  In∣timacies  can no longer subsist They grow cold and dye at once Now  Friendships  we all know are the very Bonds of  Society  again we as clearly comprehend that what we call a  Good Understanding  among publick Bodies of Men which cannot be maintained but by  FairDealings  is the Prop and Support of every Civilized  Government  Since we are so  soon and so perfectly convinced that  PlainDealing  carries along with it such Advantages it is no wonder that we should desire to be reckoned the Possessors of so valuable a  Good  It is Natural for us to desire it it is in this Sense scarce a Vertue for morally speaking it is what we cannot help desiring Every Mortal breathing has felt the first Principles of  Honesty  very strong in his Heart and even he that departed from it knows his Struggle was very great It is the Quality he covets to find in every one with whom he converses and he secretly adores the Man in whom he hap∣pens to meet it  ON the other hand if  PlainDealing  had not all these attractive  Charms  yet there is something so ridiculous and unpopular in play∣ing the Double upon Mankind there is such a Baseness in the doing of it such an Impossi∣bility of doing it often without being discover∣ed such an irretrievable Ignominy such a quick and painful Remorse that a  Life  of Dis∣simulation is full enough of Horror to fright Men from it if a  Life  of Honesty had not Charms to tempt and invite us  SURE then it is a Riddle that we are not like the People we  Love  but the People we  Hate  The meanest Slave cannot bear to be called a Dissembler and yet the great∣est Princes do not blush to dissemble  Qui nescit Dissimulare nescit Regnare  is grown their Political Motto Statesmen originally meant the same as  Faithful  Servants of a  State    they are now adays called  Politicians  and Politican is little more than a new Name for  Deceiver  Even Religious Persons have enter'd into a Conspiracy against  PlainDealing  Dis∣semblers in Holy Orders have caused  In ver∣bo Sacerdoti  to signify a  Falshood  and  Nolo Epis∣copare  to stand for desiring earnestly what a Man pretends to  decline  UPON the whole it is nothing but Folly and Cowardice that seduces Men first out of the plain Road of  Honour  and  Vertue  into the Byways of  DoubleDealing  and when once  Cunning  took the Place of  Wisdom  in Mens Minds and  Fear  instead of Resolution govern'd their Hearts they at length brought  DoubleDealing  which was at first a  Crime  by  Ac∣cident  thro' a long and constant Habit to be no less than an  Art  and  Profession  SUCH a Duty as  PlainDealing  cannot be too much known and nothing is learnt more easily but then in a Corrupt Age nothing is so easily lost in a depraved and impious Com∣pany nothing is so readily parted from  THE Clergy have a Right to diffuse among the People this Spirit of Honesty by Precept and a more particular Duty incumbent upon them to enforce it by Example But too many among them have such a Taste for world∣ly Interest as to have lost the Relish of Primi∣tive Religion and while they profess them∣selves  Priests  appear ashamed to be thought Christians  AS there is nothing nobler than a good Priest so there is nothing so shocking and ri∣diculous as to see a base Man of that Profes∣sion which annexes Reverend to his Name A Layman that does not reverence a good Pastor is a Profligate But a wicked Man in holy Orders is a Monster The Ancients when they drew the Pictures of Beauty and Ugliness took Pieces from several Objects the better to compleat their Design In order to excite true Horror against wicked Prelates I shall use the same Liberty and draw from the wickedest I have heard of a kind of Eccle∣siastical  Caligula  and suppose him to be a Bishop to give him the Fulness of his Deformity I shall then give the Sketch of a virtuous Eccle∣siastick but must remark for the Honour of Priesthood that the ill Character is compound∣ed of a great many  DoubleDealers  and that the good one did really belong to one good Man  UMBRA  was always a great Pretender to Virtue and Piety but never Possessor of Com∣mon Honesty He made Godliness his Gain and never espoused the Interests of Virtue but with the View of pushing his own  Umbra  cant∣ed inordinately but never once pray'd hearti∣ly In order to ingratiate himself with great Families he applied himself to learn a false kind of Oratory and grew a famed Panegy∣rist and Composer of Funeral Sermons in which he would salve up the Vices of great Men in favour of Deathbed Repentance  and demonstrate very elaborately how the Virtue of a Moment could atone the Impiety of an Age If he dined at a Nobleman's Table he said a scanty Grace to a full Meal and would just dip down his Head to the great Author who multiplies Food for the Use and Benefit of his Creatures but before he seated himself would make a profound Reverence to the Debauchee that entertain'd him When he grew by these Means acquainted with great Men he turn'd Politician and raised himself up on the blind Side of one by setting him at Variance with another He next became a State Preacher and changed his Note as the Times changed so that there were many Ser∣mons of his direct Contradictions to each other He sold the Gospel by Retale and lived long in Grandeur by debasing Christianity he has sometimes taken Delight in abusing the very Priesthood and triumph'd in a Bishoprick when he deserv'd to be excommunicated Thus vested unhappily with Prelatical Autho∣rity he would ruin his honest Inferiors and if they sought Justice terrify them by his Pri∣vilege This  DoubleDealer  with a Mitre on his Head lived prevaricating for many Years and then died as he lived leaving such Fals∣hoods under his Hand on his Deathbed as if the Measure of his Days had been too short for his Prevarication  THERE was such a Person lately living as  Cordatus  who had an honourable Post in the Church He belong'd to a great Cathedral  and was really a Person of Quality joining the Gentleman with the Christian he was both Religious and Polite He had this peculiar Felicity in his Temper that though he lived in an Age of Faction he judged many of a different Opinion from himself to be honest and wellmeaning Men and by treating them as such won them over to his Opinion He never used his Authority but to quiet Animosi∣ties to make or renew Friendships and to establish Peace good Will and Union He was learned and wise and tho' he had an Im∣pediment in his Speech he preached clearly to the Understanding He never chose that Oratory which tends more to nourish Pride in the Speaker than to instil Virtue into the Hearer He knew it his Duty to instruct the Ignorant and therefore studied Perspicuity in all that he deliver'd from the Pulpit He made Virtue the Study of one part of his Life and the other was taken up with the Labour of communicating what he had learnt for the Use and Instruction of others He never con∣cealed any thing that might make other Men better save one and that was his Charity All knew he recommended what he acted and finding the Preacher in earnest the Hearers were so too Nothing among  his  Parishioners was deliver'd over to Shame but Impiety He lived thus for many Years a general Blessing and his Death was a Common Calamity The Poor lost a Benefactor the Rich a valuable  Friend and every individual Man of his Ac∣quaintance an exemplary Companion  I MUST before I conclude advise all Cler∣gymen not to fix any Parts in the Description of  Umbra  upon any particular Persons they may not think well of because that will be shewing they have some of his Spirit Let them rather study to live like  Cordatus  that they may die with his Character What signi∣fies finding out who is meant by  Umbra  or who is  Cordatus  The profitable Search will be to examine what Parts they have acted like  Umbra  and amend them and in what they have personated  Cordatus  and improve them If they do otherwise they will imitate the Dog in the Fable and by catching at the Shadow lose the Substance of my Dissertation  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Helleborum frustra cum jam cutis Aegra Tumebit  Poscentes videas Venienti

sani esse hominis non sanus juret Orestes  Ibid  MONDAY  June    I PUBLISH the following LETTER in Justice to some great Qualities which were  latent  till now in my good Friend Mr  Jyngle  And which he held it seems like the  Flint  that never  sparkles  till it is  struck  upon  Old Favourite  HOW little did I think when you pro∣fess'd yourself a PLAIN DEALER that you wou'd so soon become a  Tatler  Pray don't mistake this for a  Compliment  I am not in so obliging a Humour I assure you I find Men must be  cautious  when they keep communicative Company For there are a kind of Talkative old Gentlemen who never know when to have done with their Acquaintance but will carry a Man about  with 'em for half an Age after his Funeral However to go at once into my Matter  I HAVE a very particular Regard for  Sir Portly Rufus  Nor do his Commands want their due Weight with me But as a cer∣tain Poet somewhere expresses himself  All Duties must to SelfDefence give Way  For injur'd Honour cannot brook Delay  LET the Ladies therefore  wait  for their Swanskin Breeches My Muse may per∣haps be at Leisure against Winter And none but a hasty  Prude  or two can want 'em this warm Weather So I shall have Time to stand justify'd against your false Accusation  That I study nothing but Poetry Tom Tiresome  a heavy Blockhead can talk of nothing but the Stocks But Mr  Juniper  is a Man of Learning let  him  speak of me from his own Knowledge Or I might ap∣peal to  Will Weathercock  against whom I often maintain Arguments whether there is any Truth in your Accusation But as an∣other Poet says upon some Occasion or other in some Place that I have forgot  In vain are Toothless Satires writ  'Gainst him who  feels  himself a Wit  I shall scorn to owe my Vindication to any Hand but my own And hope to convince  you before I end this Letter  That I have more in me than Poetry  PRAY who taught you in the first Place to be  Witty  upon your Friends before you cou'd Spell their  Names  right All the Men of Erudition who have been numerous among the  Jyngles  wrote themselves with an j  Consonant  A soft and shapely Letter Which you have barbarously demolish'd and built up in the Place of it a broad∣back'd  Gothick  G A rough and choaking  Guttural  that is scarce fit for any Thing but to gargle a  German  's Throat with Every  Graduate  duce take this G Every  Stu∣dent  in  Orthography  knows the manifest Difference between  Jyngle  and  Gingle  what tho'  Jilt  sounds like  Gentlewoman  and  Jackanapes  like  Gingerbread  If our Lan∣guage is a DoubleDealer and for want of settled Usage and a limited Acceptation gives Encouragement to idle People to run Divisions on the  Alphabet  that is nothing to  me  All I mean by it is to convince you that I understand  something  besides Poetry  THIS however  en passant  only for I am Master of  better  Sciences such as are new even in  Theory  But not to triumph too much over the Mistake of a Friend since it is a very common Error to think too meanly of the Merit we are familiar with I will open upon this Occasion but  one Vein  of my Skill and let it flow to your Shame till it shall be stopt by your Conviction  I AM you must know then a kind of  im∣material Anatomist  I can dissect an  Imagina∣tion  or disembowel a  Quality  I am about to make publick Profession of my Art And having my  Chariot  as good as ready the rest of my  Apparatus  will be comparatively of no Consequence I shall  drive  fast into  Practice  But the chief Scruple I labour under is by what Title to distinguish my∣self I wou'd make use of the Word  Doctor  but that the College of Physicians who place much Learning in  Privilege  wou'd have me ascend by  Degrees  to that Dignity Which is too phlegmatic a Prescription to agree with my Temper I am therefore inclina∣ble since very much of my Practice will lie among the Ladies to call myself a  MindMidwife  Insinuating by that Hint That I can see 'em as safely brought to Bed of their  Affectation  and other  spiritual Conceptions  as they can be assisted in their  Matrimonal Preg∣nancies  by the bodily Brothers of my Pro∣fession  THE first Patient I propose to  lay  is a pregnant  Male  Member of that learned  College  I was mentioning To be a  Doctor  's  Doctor  is to cure in the best Light possible And I wou'd emulate the Example of that me∣morable Magician  Zyto  who was sent for says a  grave  Historian by the Emperor  Charles the  IVth to try his Skill against a  High German Conjurer Zyto  who was a  White  Wizard and worth a Hundred of your  Faustus  's stood in Presence of the Emperor and with inflexible Composure observ'd the Instances of his Rival's Art who swallow'd at last a burning Horseshoe And defy'd our  Zyto  to do it after him But  Zyto  chose rather that he might end the Dispute at a  Morsel  to swallow the  Conjurer himself  And expanding his Mouth into horrible and inhuman Wideness snapt him up like a Radish But when he came to his dirty Shoes and disdain'd to swallow farther he ran with him to a Horsepond hard by and launch'd him out into the middle of it to the no small Entertainment and Satis∣faction of the Company  THE Name of my future Patient is  Sir Clouterly Rumble  a Professor of the  Eque∣strian  as well as the  Medicinal  Order He car∣ries on his Countenance the clearest Symp∣toms of his Grievance Which is a Distem∣per that some moral Doctors have distin∣guish'd by the Name of  Vanity  It operates with most Violence on the Head and the Heart tho' it affects the Limbs also And sometimes swells the whole Frame into the most enormous  Turgidity  It shakes the  Fin∣gers  of this afflicted Gentleman with a year∣ly Convulsion of the Nerves during which Fits it is dangerous to let  Paper  lie in his way For he applies himself with the wildest Ecstasy to strike it over at Random with odd Lines crooked Cyphers and Characters wholly unintelligible to the pitiful Dis∣quieting  and Perplexity of his Brain Which becoming heated  praeternaturally  by such extravagant Agitation inflames and nourishes his Malady  IT was a laudable Accomplishment that of calculating Distempers by examining the Patient's  Water  In Imitation of this good Custom I poured out before me a large Quantity of the sick Man's  Prosaic  and  Poe∣tic Emissions  and upon inspecting the  La∣bel  annex'd to one of 'em which he ad∣dresses poor Gentleman to an Illustrious young Prince in  Germany  with as grave and serious an Air as if it was really some∣thing fit to be look'd upon I presently discovered both the Distemper and his pro∣per Cure for it The  Tokens  as far as I can remember were Strongest and most Evi∣dent upon the following Eruption of puru∣lent Matter from a Complication of  Scrophulous  Humours which the  Greeks  call  But the Name the Patient himself wou'd have it go by is ALFRED It is in short a most malignant and virulent  Species  of the  Epic  or  Narrative Cacoethes  See a Part of it  THE Glory of a People depending on the Ex∣cellence of their King he who loves his Country cannot better promote its Happiness than by  teaching  this King to  Govern  it I know that your Highness is well enough  Taught  already But Examples being better than Precepts espe∣cially when presented in the  Works  of  Cele∣brated Authors  Men of  copious Invention  and a  fruitful Imagination  It was  for that Rea∣son Sir  That I wrote the following Poem having had the Honour to contribute more to the  Succession of your Illustrious House  than ever I boasted of because I did it for the  Service of Religion  and the  Glory  of my  Country  NO Spots in a  Purple Fever  were ever thus  Morbidly  Significant If there were not in the Nature of the Symptoms something  opposite to Contagion  I should have judged Sir  Clouterly  's Distemper to be most  Putridly Pestilential  The poor Man in fine is extreamly far gone and would certainly have been irrecoverable under any Hand but mineThere is but  One  Cure for so exceeding foul a Stomach and that must be to ply him with  Emetics  till to speak in a Physical Phrase I have made him  Vo∣mit his Heart up  I have a Pill to Purge Vanity a  Specific  and a  Nostrum  which will do his Business effectually and it shall be the first of my Operations as soon as my Horses are harnessedfor a Man wou'd not become noted you know till he's in a Readiness to be sent for I am in  Prose  you see as well as in  Poetry  Your humble Servant however  Tony Jyngle  BY a very unlucky Accident this Letter before I receiv'd it fell into the Hands of  Tom Tiresome  who has writ to me about it in very high Terms And what the Consequence of it may be I know not  Mr  Edward PlainDealer  Sir  TAKING it for granted that  you  know and  every body  knows as bad as the World is there is some Difference still it is to be hop'd between a  Poet  and a  Haber∣dasher  I wou'd have the conceited Mr  An∣tony Jyngle junior  to know that as witty as he thinks himself I am wittier than he by every  Penny  I am  worth  for  Sir Portly said  'twas Pity that  all his Money lay in his Brains  And I  say  that his  Brains are ad∣dled  to go in that manner and write  Block∣head  about One that he has nothing to do withNonor  shall  have nothing to do with for if ever he  talks Tragedy  in my House again I'll be bound to say as one of my foolish Daughters does that Mr  Jyngle is a pretty Gentleman  Which if I think or ever will think in the Humour I am in never more give  Credit to  Your Friend to serve you Thomas Tiresome  WHILE I was at a Loss how to account for the Cause of this great Misfortune the following from  Will Weathercock  unriddled the whole Mystery  Dearest Sir  HONEST Mr  Jyngle  our good and agreeable Friend put into my Hands Yesterday a Copy of that comical Letter which he sent you about  Sir Clouterly Rum∣ble  and I being wonderfully pleased with the Fancy must needs be shewing it to Al∣derman  Blunder  who dined with us at  Sir Portly  's The Alderman laugh'd immode∣rately and was so taken with it that all Din∣ner Time he could talk of nothing but  Tony  's  Pills to Purge Vanity  But  Tom Tire∣some  unluckily came down in the After∣noon and the first Thing the Alderman said was  Oh Mr Tiresome Here's the Pleasantest LetterNay you must see it for 'twill make you laugh till you cackle again  It was in vain to endeavour at diverting him by other Subjects  The Letter  was all his Cry  Mr Tiresome must see the Letter  In short he did so and the only Remark he made was that he found himself called  Blockhead  in it Well you can't imagine how angry he is about it Pray do your best to recon∣cile 'em or we shall have sad Work at  Sir Portly  's Shall I give you my Opinion which is most in the wrong  Certainly Mr Jyngle  for why should one Man call another  Names  Yet  Mr Tiresome  was most to Blame because  these Things  are  Common among Friends  But be it as it will I thought it absolutely necessary to write you Word of it and my own Opinion of the Difference Who am  Your most Faithful and Sincere Servant  William Weathercock  I AM afraid I must close in with my Friend  Will  's Opinion  That they are both in the Wrong  But what shall I do with this unlucky Alder∣man  Blunder  The odd Creature has no harm  in  him but he  does  more harm than a  Stockjob∣ber  He has a plain and open Heart but wants both  Foresight  and  Reflection  He is Mis∣chievous not Malicious and errs on with∣out Ill Purpose from a Natural  Clumsiness  of Mind and  Healthy Coarseness  in his Understand∣ing He overturns Things without feeling 'em like the  Elephant  of  Africa  that walk∣ing gravely in the Night among the Villages of the  Negroes  does not disturb himself in the least about the Houses that stand in his Way but keeping streight forwards oversets 'em says a  Dutch  Author without intending it as if they were so many  Nutshells  WHEN I took him with me the first time to drink Tea at  Patty Amble  's after she had prattled and trifled him into an Ecstasy at her Wit and Beauty he turn'd from her in a Start of Rapture and said to me aloud  How  cou'd you be so Mistaken as to tell me she was not Handsome  I shall never forget the extra∣ordinary Look she obliged me with upon this fine Question I gloss'd it over as well as I could by telling  Blunder  That he misrepre∣sented my Words which were not  That she was not Handsome  But  That she was more  Witty  than  Handsome He had found out by this Time that he had done a ridiculous Action and look'd as  like an Ass  as any reasonable Man could have desir'd him but he repented as most Men do when it was too late and to no Purpose And I verily believe I am doom'd to  great Afflictions  if my Passion shou'd conti∣nue for that  dull Start of Mr Alderman Blun∣der  's  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Micat inter omnes  Julium sidus velut inter ignes  Luna Minores  Gentis humanae pater atque custos  Orte Saturno tibi cura Magni  Caesaris fatis data tu secundo Caesare Regnes  FRIDAY  June    SIR  HAVING observ'd That my  Extract  of the CZAR of  RUSSIA  's  Letter to his SON  which you publish'd in your  th Paper gave a very great Surprize to the Generality of your Readers who had form'd upon common Rumour an Opinion of that Prince's Death extremely different from the Truth I now send you as brief an Abstract as possible from a Relation which was pub∣lish'd in  High Dutch  by the Minister of a  German Court  not likely to be partial in Favour of the  Czar  and who was present and an EyeWitness of the Facts which he publishes  THE  Czar  had long inclin'd to ally him∣self with some powerful Family of  Germany  by the Marriage of his Son whom he hop'd to reclaim from his Indolence by the Conver∣sation of a Princess of high Extraction and a noble Education For this Prince had by a continual associating himself with the vilest Company contracted such corrupt Habits as could not fail of producing an Aversion to him in all honest Minds He was so far sunk in Sensuality that no Representations no Pains could recover him So that the  Czar  being at length by his Son's perverse Con∣duct almost brought to an Abhorrence of his Person began to drop Intimations That he wou'd cause him to be shav'd for a Monk and shut him up in a ConventThe Prince's own Favourites were alarm'd at the Danger and earnestly entreated him to have his Wel∣fare at Heart and to conceal if he cou'd not suppress his rigorous Hatred against Foreigners This dispos'd him to fall in with  the  Czar  's Proposition and he was married as is well known to a Princess of the Family of  Brunswick Wolfenbuttel  and Sister to the present Empress  BUT after he had brought her to  Russia  he shew'd not the least Complaisance nor endeavour'd at all to divert herOn the contrary I observ'd That on all Publick Occasions he never exchang'd a Word with her but industriously shun'd her Company The Prince had the Apartments of the right Wing and the Princess those of the Left But they saw each other scarce once a Week and had not the Prince consider'd the beget∣ting an Heir as the Support of his own Safety he would have made himself intirely invisible to her He even neglected the Repair of the House to that Degree that the Princess lay expos'd to the Injuries of the Air and Wea∣ther in her own Bedchamber  WHEN the  Czar  expostulated with him concerning these Proceedings he loaded  her  with Reproaches as if it was she who had accus'd him whereas that wise Princess sub∣mitted to her hard Fate with the firmest Con∣stancy and Resignation nor had any other Witnesses of her Tears but the Princess of  EastFreisland  her Companion and the Walls of her own Apartment She liv'd four Years in this Manner and was then seiz'd with an Indisposition so dangerous that her Recovery was immediately despair'd of  WHEN she perceiv'd her End approaching she desir'd to see the  Czar  who was at the same Time indispos'd But he caus'd himself to be carry'd to her in a Machine mov'd on WheelsThe Princess took her Leave of him in the most moving Expressions and recommended her two Children to his Care and Protection embracing them in the most ten∣der manner possible and almost melting away in Tears Then she sent for her Servants who to the Number of two hundred Persons and upwards lay prostrate in the Anticham∣ber imploring Heaven to assist their dying Mistress in her last AgoniesShe comforted admonished and gave them her BlessingThe Physicians would still be pressing her to take some Medicines but she threw the Glasses from her crying out with great Emotion  Do not torture me any morePermit me to die in quietFor I am resolved to live no longer  She expir'd in fervent Prayer and depart∣ed an unfortunate Life before she was quite one and twenty Years old  IT was soon after the Funeral of this Prin∣cess that the  Czar  gave that admirable Letter which you publish'd in a late PAPER into the Hands of his Son And what follows is the  unequal  Answer which he had the Mortifica∣tion to receive from him  The Answer of Prince  ALEXEI  of  RUSSIA  to the Letter of the  CZAR  his  Father  Most Clement Lord and Father  I HAVE read your Majesty's PAPER and have nothing to reply to it but that if your Majesty will deprive me of the Succes∣sion to the Crown of  Russia  by Reason of my Incapacity Your  Will be done  I do not think myself fit for the Government The Rule of so many Nations requires a more vigorous Man than I amI will not pre∣tend to the Succession for the future of which I take God to Witness and swear it upon my Soul desiring nothing more than bare Maintenance during Life  Your most humble Servant And Son  ALEXEI  MANY further Attempts the  Czar  made on his Son's Obstinacy But the Consequence of them all and of his pretended Resignation was his Flight to a Foreign Protection and a plunging himself into those High Crimes which are particulariz'd in his Sentence  THE  Czar  upon this extraordinary and me∣lancholy Occasion convok'd a High Court of Justice consisting of all the  Chief  of the  States  He lay for eight Days successively many Hours on his Knees imploring God with Tears to inspire him with Sentiments becom∣ing his double Dutyas a  Monarch  and as a  Father  The Prince was brought into Court under Guard of four Officers and pro∣ceeded against in a Manner too tedious and circumstantial to be particulariz'd in so short a Compass  THE Court upon the whole having pro∣nounc'd a formal Sentence and condemn'd the Prince to Death the violent Surprize and Ter∣ror of his Mind and the disorderly Conflict and Fluctuation of his Passions threw him into an Apoplectick Fit The  Czar  no sooner heard that he was in this Danger and that he was desirous to see him but he visited his dy∣ing Son with the most visible Marks of Pity and a Proof of Paternal Tenderness  THE Prince at Sight of his Father burst out into Tears and with Hands rais'd and folded said  'He had grievously offended the Majesty of Almighty God and the Good∣ness of the  Czar  that he had not even a Wish to recover from his Indisposition be∣ing unworthy to live longer He begg'd his Majesty for God's sake only to take from him the Curse he had laid on him at  Moskow  to forgive him all his heavy Crimes to impart him his Blessing and to cause Prayers to be put up for his Soul  DURING these moving Words the  Czar  and the whole Court almost melted away in  TearsHis Majesty return'd him a most no∣ble and pathetic Answer He represented in a few of the mildest Words he cou'd select all his  Length  of Offences and then gave him in the most touching Manner possible his For∣giveness and his Blessing After which they parted with abundance of Tears and La∣mentations on both Sides  VERY late in the Night came a Messen∣ger to acquaint the  Czar  that the Prince was extremely desirous once more to see his Fa∣ther And his Majesty had just stept into his Sloop to go over to the Fortress when ano∣ther Messenger brought News that the Prince was already expir'dHe was deposited in the new BuryingVault of the  Czarish  Family and plac'd next the Coffin of his late ConsortThe  Czar  among the Mourners carried a lighted WaxTaper in his Hand and was observ'd to be bath'd in Tears during the Pro∣cession and in particular at the Church Ser∣vice where the Priest had chose for the Text of his Funeral Sermon these Words of the mournful  DavidO my Son Absalommy Sonmy Son Absalom  YOU see Sir how different this Great Monarch's Conduct in so nice and trying a Circumstance really was from the Clouds which  Rumour  blew upon it to shade and blacken an  unequal'd Character  The  Roman Fierceness  has been  celebrated  in Men who not only  condemn'd  their Sons but stood by and  saw  'em executed in the most severe  and shameful Manner for the Love and Safe∣ty of their Country Yet there was a  Brutal Inflexibility  and a kind of  Politic Necessity  in the Actions of those  Roman Fathers  But this prodigious  modern  Prince under no In∣fluence of Fear Dependence or Obligation  chose  to set aside his  own Blood  for the future Glory of his  People  Only with this fine Dif∣ference from the  Roman  that what was  there  done with a  Stoicism  that gave Suspicion of Insensibility was  here  adorn'd with  Pity  and the most manifest Strugglings of an amia∣ble  Weakness  that convinc'd his Subjects how  Dear  their Prosperity must be to a Sovereign who cou'd thus provide for it by a Sacrifice against his Nature even of his private and domestick Comfort  HAVING shewn in the foregoing Instances the  afflicted  Side of the  Czar  's Behaviour It is but just that I shou'd change the Light and surprize you by a View of that unshaken  Firmness  with which he regarded the  Danger  of the Conspiracy while the Reflection  Who was the Author of it  gave him so moving a  Misery  UPON the Examination and Confessions of that infinite Number of Confederates who were engag'd in the Prince's Projects it ap∣pear'd that the Defection was so wide and so general that many of his nearest and most trusted Servants were embark'd in it and such also in whose Hands lay great Part of his Wealth and Power so that he was congra∣tulated  in Form by the Ambassadors of Fo∣reign Princes upon his Discovery and Pre∣vention of so endangering a Combination To which he gave this noble Answer  Dan∣gers always are strong if they are weakly resist∣edWhere a Fire meets with Straw it soon spreads and burns through itBut if Iron lies in its Way it falls back and is extinguish'd  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Uterne  Ad Casus dubios fidet sibi certius hic qui  Pluribus assuerit mentem corpusque superbum  An

Rack while I affirm in a kind of Riddle for the Use and Pleasure of my ReaderThat tho' every Body  may  be Happy yet scarce any Body  can  be so  THERE is no Definite Point that we can fix at when we wou'd describe  what Happi∣ness is  yet the Road to this great Journey's End is very Short and Obvious One wou'd wonder therefore how it comes to be so uni∣versally  mistaken if it were not easily observ'd that most Men are under an Error even as to the very Placing it  Happiness  is seated not in  Power  but in  Will  Though very few can be  Fortunate  yet all Men may be  Sa∣tisfy'd  And they who lessen their Desires have in one great Point the Advantage over those who enlarge their Prosperity for allow∣ing both to be equally Happy yet the First at least are Happy with less Danger and In∣cumbrance  WHOEVER can be so wise as to content himself with his present Lot while he patient∣ly hopes a better will escape the common Fate of tasting with Disrelish what he finds within his Reach from a restless and devour∣ing Thirst after what is Future and Uncer∣tainLife slides from the Impatient like the Motion of a murmuring Brook where the Cur∣rent wastes much faster than if the Surface had been smooth and silentWhen we are upon the Brink of the Grave we startand wonder at our Situation And then first be∣gin to look back with Shame and Sorrow at the too Little we have  Done  in Life and the too Much we have  wish'd  in it  Oh greatly bless'd who can as Fate requires  By ductile Wisdom temper your Desires  Balanc'd  within  you look abroad serene  And marking both Extreams pass clear between  Oh cou'd your lov'd Example teach your Skill  And as it moves my Wonder mend my Will  Calm wou'd my Passions grow my Lot might please  And my sick Soul shou'd  think  itself to Ease  But to the Future while I strain my Eye  Each present Good slips undistinguish'd by  Still what I  wou'd  contends with what I  can  And my wild Wishes leap the Bounds of Man  SO complain'd a Friend of mine to a Gen∣tleman wiser than himself by as much as his Desires were more moderateIt was in a Poem which he call'd his  Choice  But his Mind was so discompos'd by a Tempest of ungovern'd Wishes that he scarce knew what to chuse even when his  Choice  was the Sub∣ject  chosen  If in my Power it lies to limit Hope  And my unchain'd Desires can fix a Scope  This were my ChoiceOh Friend

were ask∣ing him one Day  'Whether ever he had seen or heard of any Man who had so noble a Soul as  Hatemtai  He smil'd and return'd this AnswerI walk'd out into the Fields on a certain Time when at a Sacrifice of a Hundred Camels my House was fill'd by my Order with all the Poor and the Miserable who cou'd be found in the Space of many Miles round my DwellingSome of the Lords in my Company dis∣cern'd at a little Distance a Man who was very busy in gathering up a Bundle of dry Thorns to sell at the next Village We went to him and ask'd why he was not among the Number of his Fellows who were  feasting at the House of  HatemtaiBe∣cause  answer'd he  a Man who can provide himself with Bread by his own Labour needs not be oblig'd to  HatemtaiThis Man  said he  had a Nobler Soul than  Hatemtai  I WALK'D lately into the City toward the Close of the Day and observing a Church open went in to Evening Prayers I sat near a Lady whose fine Face methought appear'd like the Seat of a long War between  Beauty  and  Affliction  She saw that I had no PrayerBook and modestly offer'd me her own I kept it during the Service and took Plea∣sure to charge my Memory with the Eight following

many of their Letters therefore as  I can make room for to Day shall compose my  Reader  's Entertainment  Oh SIR  WOU'D to Heaven when you were so severe upon  Masquerades  you had warn'd us against  Opera  you had sav'd an undone Woman and one who for ought I see is still likely to be undone for think∣ing no Harm where I had heard there was no Danger I am fallen desperately in Love with  Signior  the  Italian What d'ye call it  One of those People with an illfavour'd Name like the ugly Folks in the  Bible  that waited on King  Ahasuerus  I thought I cou'd have sworn I had been Proof against  Man  But alasHe is not ManHe is a Being more refin'd and I am wretched without RemedyI have heard some Peo∣ple report Things to his Prejudice but I dare swear it was all EnvyThe Men to be sure cou'd never endure him because the Women were so pleas'd with him and be∣sides he  sings  so much finerthan they canBut do you think Mr  PlainDealer  that a Man that sings finely may'nt be a good Man for all his SingingI wou'd fain know what they mean by laughing when I mention the Value I have for him and saying with a waggish Look that  no Lion will eat a Lion  However heartily I love him I did not tell 'em I wou'd  eat  himBut I suppose they mean something that I  fancy is not true No Body I am sure wou'd  think  it who has seen how he makes Love in the  Opera  'sI know where I can sit by him

following VersesThey were writ∣ten in  Italian  by  Milton  when he was at  Florence  in his Youth and fell in Love as  Fidelia  has done with a Person whose Lan∣guage he understood but little ofThey were address'd to his  Italian  Mistress  I  When in your Language I unskill'd address  The shortpac'd Efforts of a trammell'd Muse  Soft  Italy  's fair Criticks round me press  And my mistaking

Do  thou  my Soul's soft  Hope  these Triflers awe  Tell 'em 'tis nothing how or what I  writ  Since Love from silent  Looks  can Language draw  And scorns the lame Impertinence of  Wit  Dear SIR  I AM an honest Man and keep a  CoffeeHouse  and pay TwoPence apiece for your  PlainDealers  My Customers are so pleas'd with them that I take it for granted they are worth the Money But what I think I have just Cause to complain of is that when a Gentleman calls for a Dish of  Coffee  and the  Plain Dealer  if he finds any thing in the Paper that he is mightily taken with he makes no Scruple of convincing me that  he  is as  taking  as the Paperthat is to say he puts it up and carries it away with him to divert his Club or his MistressSo he has Twopence in Wit and Twopence in Liquor Yet pays me only for the Li∣quoras if Wit were worth NothingI am serv'd thus so often that though your Papers come out but twice a Week I take 'em in twice a Day as my  AccountBook  can make appear by very woeful Ex∣perienceNow what I want you to say  to these lightfinger'd Purchasers is that a Man who has no Hair may as well lay Claim to my Periwig as a Man who has no Wit pocket up that which I have

Shot among the WildFowl at our last HorseRaces but the only two I wounded were a  Buz∣zard  of the Foot Guards and a  CanaryBird  called a TemplerThe Templer was a Wit and I speak it with a Sigha charming oneHe was vain conscious chearful and as false as my own Smiles wereMy Foot Officer was serious honest friendly but I thought he was too DullI receiv'd both their Addresses but not with equal Sensibility The  Soldier  I slight∣ed  but the  Wit  became TriumphantNow first my Heart felt Warmth enough to beat with real Passion and had just impress'd the Image of this gay this lov'd Deceiver when News was brought one Morning that he had bid farewel to  Epsom  without taking Leave of me to follow a Flirt of a Fortune that was hoyden'd away to  London  But what gave me a double Sense as well of my Error as my Shame was that the Evening before this happen'd my honest Lover the  Soldier  had slid into my Hand the following Prophetick SONG which I bosom'd up for a  Billet  I  Be wary my

silly enough to think Dull was the great∣est  Wit  of the twoI wou'd tell him so now I have lost the other but that I am afraid he will laugh at me  BUT I hope you'll contrive it so that he may read it in the  PlainDealer  Pray put it in for you can't guess the Disorder of  Your nettled humble Servant  COQUETILLA  SIR  I AM a most  Catonick  Adherer to the Old  English  Simplicity the Vertue the Blunt∣ness and the Liberty which were the Or∣naments of our AncestorsI have taken some Pains to prove that  we Britons  shou'd not only be  left Free  but that we  ought  to be left  Rough  tooI am not able there∣fore to resist the Indignation that rises in me at the too visible Encrease in the Num∣ber of our  Courtiers  It is natural for our Gentry to love to shine in that gay Light But why should  Tradesmen  be corrupted by the Taste of undue DignityI cannot walk the Streets but I see fresh Instances in every Corner of the spreading Power of Preferment The Court Verge of old  reach'd I think but to  CharingCross  Of late it is  ek'd  out to  WhiteChapel  and  NortonFolgate  Nay I have been credi∣bly inform'd that there are Courtiers of great Eminence in and about  Hockley in the

have his  CowHouse  But there is another Court Establish∣ment which little can be said in support of and that is the  King's AssHouse  His Honour of this Office holds his Re∣sidence in the Road to  HideParkCorner  It being Decent he says that his Dwelling shou'd be near his Duty and where he may be under the Eye of his Fellow StatesmenI was the other Day at an odd Christ'ning in one of the Horns of this huge City where a newly preferr'd Court Lady was complain∣ing to her Sister Gossips How unavoid∣able it is in Divided Times for those who are distinguish'd by Court Favours to have the  Disaffected  for their EnemiesI whi∣sper'd a grave Gentlewoman to know what  Post  that great Lady held And was an∣swer'd with becoming Seriousness that she was marry'd to the  King  's  Mustardmaker  HIS Majesty's  Oculist in Extraordinary  lately departing this Life I am glad it has  been resolv'd to abolish that High Station Nothing being more dangerous to the Peace of a Body Politic than to multiply Officers without OfficeYet there are not wanting imprudent People who have Hopes of in∣stituting a  Royal Mantuamaker  in Place of the defunct  Oculist  Now it is quite a dif∣ferent Case where Commissions are really useful No good Subject for Example can think much of the  King  's  Puddingmaker  and a great deal might be said in Honour of the  King  's  Punchhouse  The  Royal Chimneysweeper  is a Minister not of Rank only but Necessity and something like it may be offer'd in Behalf of  His Majesty  's  ButterWoman  But I wou'd be glad to be inform'd what serious Pretence can be urg'd by any Man who makes a Conscience of his Arguments in Defence of the  Royal Gin∣shop  Or who can assert the Benefit or indeed the Propriety of the  King  's  Royal Ridinghood Woman  Or  His Majesty  's  sworn Staymaker  TO speak with the good old Bluntness of a  Briton  these are some of the luxuriant  Ex∣crescences  of Monarchy and wou'd in the watchful Times of our Forefathers have been par'd away for the Publick Benefit And I will take it upon me to averr that unless some seasonable Restraint be soon put upon this growing Evil the Courtiers will set up Shops in the very Heart

useful Mass of Learning as distinguishes  Doctor Fossile  render him capable of discerning and correcting this odd WeaknessIt exposes him to the Ridicule of malicious Persons who hating a Merit they despair of ever equalling are glad to depreciate his Character by make∣ing the Worst of his ParticularitySince  Ars est celare Artem  the Doctor wou'd be thought more learn'd if he less endeavour'd to

Jyngle  as a mere Repeater of his own Rhimes there is now ample Room for forming great Idea's of his Abilities and of the Preferment he may come to since he is the Inventor and will in all Probability be the Perfecter of this  more noble Art of Healing  And if in the very Infancy of his Science he makes a thorough Cure of his desperate Patient Sir  Clouterly  I do verily think after that there will not be the least Room for any  sick minded  Person what∣soever to despair of Success under his  Regimen  HOWEVER since a Person must be in a  painful  way indeed before he  cries out  for the Physician I would propound a kind of  Diet  to those who discover Symptoms of any ap∣proaching Spiritual Malady which will serve them by way of Prevention This Method is certainly preferable to the common way of Delaying till the Disease is actually upon them which is then in Danger of not being removed without Recourse to violent Reme∣dies In Sir  Clouterly  's Case the Prescription of Mr  Jyngle  is so very ungentle that Fair Ladies who find themselves a going into any  Immoral Habit  should one would think take early Care to stop the Progress of it for fear of lying under the Necessity of such dreadful Emeticks That it seems which the  Titled  Patient must be forced to undergo for the Cure of  Vanity  only and what Person with a  Title  thinks  Vanity  so  great  an  Ill  will he confesses be attended with such violent Workings that it will make him  vomit his Heart up  Now who would not avoid this rough Handling by taking Things in Time when they apprehend a Disorder to be rising and observing a regular  MindDiet  I SHALL proceed to lay down some ge∣neral Rules and short Recipes by way of Spe∣cimen that the Ladies especially may encou∣rage a Pocket Volume which I intend short∣ly to publish on the Subject of  MindLabours  and  Deliveries  and which I only wish may be dispersed into as many Hands as  Culpeper  's Mid∣wifery  for I am sure I may say without Boasting it will be a more useful and valua∣ble Treatise  PERSONS who have any Consideration for the Health of their Minds are desired to re∣flect  Seriously  that all  Excessive Passions  are  Distempers  of the  Mind  and but  Forerunners  of  Diseases  in the  Body  Let them know that nothing conduces more to the Restraint of these  Humours  which grow peccant and per¦nicious the very Moment they become Inor∣dinate than Exercise in the Thinking Fa∣culty  READING the Salutary Maxims of Wise Men with Attention digesting them by Me∣ditation and imprinting them on the Memory by frequent Recollection is a  MindDiet  or  Regimen  which will in a short Time restore Health to a decayed Constitution and add incredible Vigour to a Weak and Languishing Understanding Minds the best arm'd are not always Invulnerable There are constantly some peevish Accidents some cross and fret∣ful Disappointments in the rugged Road of Life to throw a Cloud over the serenest and discompose the most equal Tempers But there is not methinks a quicker or sweeter Re∣medy than to step to the Closet and take down a  moral Draught  which will smooth us into the most perfect Calm  Gallus Tibullus Ovid Catullus  will afford us  Lenitives  and  Horace Juvenal  and  Persius  will furnish us with  Cor∣rosives  so that we may find a Cure for every  Distemper There are not any Infirmities Pains or Sufferings of the Mind but what the Writings of some of these Doctors contain proper  Specificks  for The best of this Method of prescribing is that the Physick is easy and delightful For what does it consist in but Exercising one's Wits with some of the best Company in the World whom even Ladies cannot go to for Diversion without finding them at the same Time useful or visit for Instruc∣tion without finding them agreeable  Dry∣den Congreve  c Have made them refined  Englishmen  and our  Modern  Beauties have the same Advantages in their  Translations  the  Ro∣man  Ladies had in the  Originals  WHY should it not be the Care of profess'd  Visiters  not to contract ill Habits which are always very catching and fill the Mind with Spots and Blemishes a Toast that never had the SmallPox would be in a Pannick at the Appearance of a Face newly mark'd and Per∣sons who break out with Detraction have the SmallPox of the Mind and are frightful when the Marks are upon them  YOU shall see a Young Creature torture her∣self into Beauty punish herself to please her Lover and skin her Face for a Complexion And yet tho' she knows she is a little Vixen in her Nature she shall not so much as once after she is married to him endeavour to learn how she may avoid the praeternatural  Palenesses  and  Flushings  which Anger excites in a Beautiful Countenance giving the whole Form of it such  a contrary Cast that it is enough to terrify all Beholders Whenever any of these blooming Bustlers begin to bluster the Husband may be the Physician for when the fiery Par∣ticles within them betray any of the  Soft  Things to an unbecoming Fit of  Rage  the Sight of a LookingGlass at that Critical Minute of De∣formity has been prescribed by our Fore∣fathers with admirable and neverfailing Effect But this is only a transitory Cure and does not go to the Root of the Disease There are Pas∣sages relating to the Effects of  Anger  in a mar∣ried State that would place their  Inside  as clear∣ly before them A Lady whom this Practice would not work into Gentleness of Temper could never be cured of so violent an Inflam∣mation but by one of Mr  Jyngle  's severest Operations  IS a Lady jealous And will she not have Sense enough to blush at the Follies of Jealousy when she is reading them in private and save herself from the Inconveniency of looking frightful in publick Company She stands highly in need of Mr  Jyngle  Who that could not  read  away a  Fit  of the  Spleen  in that Excellent  Modern  Poem the  Rape of the Lock  could be otherwise than given over as quite lost Unless Mr  Jyngle  appear'd to carry it off by his new Invention Those Ladies who have  Wit  enough to plead their being of the  Unfortify'd  Sex in so  artful  a Manner  That if weak Women go astray  Their Stars are more in Fault than they  have likewise  Wit  enough to  Fortify  them∣selves by proper Lectures against the Attacks of Passion and Folly Therefore after this seasonable Warning Mr  Jyngle is the Word  and if any wild disorderly pretty Creatures will  Steal  away from these  Precepts  and run  Gadding  after their  own  Inventions till they  hurt  their  Health  and  Quiet  Care shall be taken to send Mr  Jyngle  with all conve∣nient Speed after them and  he may drive as fast as he pleases into Practice  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Tendentem{que} manus jam sua fata videntem  Et

upon Human Na∣ture with a Violence not to be resisted All the Looks Words and Actions of those who were dear to us in their Lifetimes rise like Ghosts to haunt the Memory But with this Difference from their Effects before Death had interpos'd that we now remember with a kind of Pleasure the  Wrongs  and  Slights  we may have suffer'd from them as the only Remedy we can have Recourse to for some Mitigation of our Sorrow Whereas their  Vertues  their  Endearments  and the  Good Offices  they have done us are like  Tortures  to the  Imagination  and the most painful  Enflamers  of our  Misery  BUT the Tenderness of the  Lovelier Sex  maintains a generous Superiority over ours in the Warmth and Softness of their Sorrow There is a Sweetness in a Mother's Grief when she drowns her  Charms  in  Tears  that raises  Beauty  into  Majesty  and mixes Reve∣rence with our Fondness for her It is her  Soul  we are then enamour'd of And the  Husband Son  or  Father  of such a Mourner considers with an inward Triumph the In∣terest he is proud to hold in a Heart so grac'd by Pity and so sincerely Sweet and Sensi∣ble  THE Force of Natural Affection has its strongest Effect in  Mothers  from the great Ne∣cessity there is for that long Care and Pati∣ence which are the Supports of the Human Species during the Wants and Helplessness of Infancy And the most unreasonable Par∣tialities of fond  Mothers  to their Children are not only Pardonable but Beautiful when we consider what good Effects are owing to the Influence of this charming Weakness  SHAKESPEARE  's Tragedy of  King John  has I hear been lately alter'd with Design to bring it on the Stage next Winter I doubt not but the Alterer has been careful not to rob us of the Grief of  Constance  for the Loss of her Son  Arthur  when in the Hands of the King who designs to murder himBeing told that she is  Mad  not  Sorrowful  she replies  I am not mad Oh wou'd to Heaven I were  If I were mad I shou'd  forget  my  Son  I have heard 'em say  That we shall meet and know our Friends in Hea∣ven  If so I yet may see my Boy again  But Sorrow's  Canker  will have  eat  his Bloom  'Till he looks Pale and Meagre as a Ghost  And dies so chang'd that when in Heaven we meet  I fear I shall not know him  THIS Thought of her Son's Sorrow and his becoming so alter'd by it as not to be known if she shou'd meet him in Heaven has so natural a Mixture in it of the  Tender  and the  Wild  Something so exquisitely adapt∣ed both to her Character and her Condition that I have always consider'd it as one of the liveliest Strokes in the Tragedy Tho' it is finely supported by what follows  Grief  fills the Place up of my absent Son  Lies in his Bed walks with me up and down  Puts on his pretty Looks repeats his Words  Swells out his vacant Garments with his Form  But  Memory  smarts to miss him  HOW much easier and less lovely wou'd this  Constance  have appear'd under the Afflicti∣on of her Son's Loss had she regarded him with the cold Indifference of a Modern  Mo∣ther  whom I am glad for her own Sake not to find nam'd in the following Letter  SIR  I HAVE the Pleasure of a very intimate Acquaintance with that unhappy young Gentleman whose Verses to a Painter you printed in one of your PLAIN DEALERS with a generous Remark or two on the Merit of the poor Gentleman himself and the uncommon Cruelty of his  Mother  PERHAPS few Things cou'd be more sur∣prizing than a History of his Birth and UsageOf two Fathers whom he might have claim'd and  both  of them  Noble  he lost the  Title  of the one and a  Provision  from the other's Pity by the Means alone of this  Mother  who as if she had resolv'd not to leave him a single Comfort afterwards robb'd him of  herself  too and in direct Op∣position to the Impulse of her Natural Com∣passion upon mistaken Motives of a false Delicacy shut her Memory against his Wants and cast him out to the severest Mi∣series without allowing herself to contri∣bute even such small Aid as might at least have preserv'd him from Anguish and pointed out some Path to his future In∣dustry  BUT I forbear to be too particular on any of these Heads because I know it wou'd give him Pain for whose sake only I remember them For while Nature acts so weakly on the Humanity of the Parent she seems on the Son's side to have doubled her  usual Influence Even the most shocking Personal Repulses and a Series of Contempt and Injuries received at her Hands through the whole Course of his Life have not been able to eraze from his Heart the Impres∣sions of his filial Duty Nor which is much more strange of his Affection I have known him walk three or four times in a dark Evening through the Street this  Mo∣ther  lives in only for the Melancholy Plea∣sure of looking up at her Windows in Hopes to catch a Moment's Sight of her as she might cross the Room by Candle Light  HIS good Qualities which are very nu∣merous ought the more to be esteem'd and cherish'd because he owes them to himself only And without the Advantage of Friends Fortune or Education wants nei∣ther Knowledge nor Politeness to deserve a  Mother  's Blessing and adorn rather than disgrace herI am strongly persuaded from the Character which upon all Occa∣sions he has taken Pleasure to give me of the Lady's Humanity with regard to the rest of the World that nothing but her hav∣ing much too long already been a Stranger to such a Son cou'd make her satisfy'd to continue soIt is impossible at least that she shou'd not distinguish him by some kind Notice some little Mark of her returning Tenderness if without Regard to his Me∣rit she knew but his Manner of thinking of her Which is itself a shining Merit and  a surprizing Instance of Generosity if con∣sider'd against those Reasons which might excuse a different Treatment of her  He writ the following Copy of Verses and several other on the same Subject at a Time when I know not which was most to be wonder'd atThat he shou'd be serene enough for  Poetry  under the Extremity of IllFortuneOr that his  Subject  shou'd be the Praise of her to whom he ow'd a Life of Misery  Hopeless abandon'd aimless and oppress'd  Lost to Delight and every Way distress'd  Cross his cold Bed in wild Disorder thrown  Thus sigh'd  Alexis  friendless and alone  Why do I breathe  What Joy  can  Being  give  When she who gave me Life forgets I Live  Feels not these Wintry Blastsnor heeds my Smart  But shuts me from the Shelter of her Heart  Saw me expos'd to Want to Shame to Scorn  To Illswhich make it  Mis'ry  to be  born  Cast me regardless on the World's bleak Wild  And bad me be a  Wretch  while yet a  Child  Where can he hope for Pity Peace or Rest  Who moves no Softness in a  Mother  's Breast  Custom Law Reason  All  my Cause forsake  And  Nature sleeps  to keep my Woes  awake  Crimes which the  Cruel  scarce believe can  be  The  Kind  are guilty of to ruin  Me  Even she who bore me blasts me with her Hate  And  meant  my  Fortune makes  Herself my  Fate  Yet has this sweet Neglecter of my Woes  The softest tend'rest Breast that  Pity  knows  Her Eyes shed Mercy wheresoe'er they shine  And her Soul  melts  at every Woe  but Mine  Sure then some secret Fate for Guilt unwill'd  Some Sentence praeordain'd to be fulfill'd  Plung'd me thus deep in Sorrow's searching Flood  And wash'd me from the Mem'ry of her Blood  But oh whatever Cause has mov'd her Hate  Let me but sigh in Silence at my Fate  The  God within  perhaps may  touch  her Breast  And when  she pities  who can be distress'd  THEY who are depriv'd by Death of their dearest Friends and Relations are left wretched in the Want of them But they have this Comfort howeverthat before those Deaths they were happierWhereas this Gentleman on the contrary is unhappy by his Mother's Loss while she is  living  gay and fortunate and only  dead  to that Affecti∣on which other Mothers chiefly  live for  IF you Mr  PlainDealer  wou'd give us a Paper on these Heads it might I believe have some Effect for the Service of a too early Sufferer whose Merit and the Wrongs he has sustain'd from his Parent's Cruelty entitle him to the Hope of finding better Parents among Strangers to the open Re∣proach and Dishonour of a  Mother  who since she has so many fine Qualites wants perhaps but to be touch'd into a Sense of  her Mistake to atone for it by a generous Change in her Regard for him for the fu∣ture I am  Sir  Your most Humble Servant  AMINTAS  I AM sorry that in a Nation justly famous for GoodNature we have so strong an  Ex∣ception  as may be taken from this Letter But I will forbear with my Correspondent's Leave to address any Arguments to the  Lady  Since if she is not harden'd beyond Nature the ge∣nerous Sorrow and the Sufferings express'd in her Son's Sentiments will melt her Heart into Pity for him and move her more effec∣tually than any Thing that can be morally offer'd to her  I WILL turn my Advice therefore to the Service of those Sons and Daughters who are neglected and made unhappy by the Aver∣sion or Partiality of the Parent they depend on A Case too common in most Families and which stands in need of all the Comfort that can be pour'd upon their Affliction  IT is a very melancholy Circumstance when this happens as it often does to the finest spirited Child of the whole Number But it shou'd be Ground enough for Consolation that such Sufferers owe the wrong Position they appear in to a Weakness in the Parents Reason A kind of Deception in their Judg∣ment's  Sight  As when we see our Shadows  in the Water our Heads seem to hang down∣wards and our lowest Parts are preferr'd to look unnaturally uppermost  TIME will certainly bring a Remedy to those who bear this Trial with Temperance For Submission disarms the Rancour that wou'd gather Strength from Exercise by an imprudent Opposition None whose Injuries are receiv'd with Mildness and return'd by Acts of Affection can be long without dis∣covering and repenting their Ingratitude Whereas by permitting ourselves to  revenge  the Wrongs we suffer we furnish our Oppres∣sors with an Appearance of Justice and only make them more blind when 'tis our Interest that they shou'd see clearly  IMPATIENCE under this or any other Affliction does but double our Mortification How languid wou'd Life be to the largest Part of the World if Expectation did not quicken it  Hope  is the sweetest of all CompanionsIf it leads us not to the Road which we are most inclin'd to travel in its Conversation however is so entertaining and agreeable that we can never tire in the Journey  WHEN a wicked Man is happy he seems unworthy of his Happiness But where Ver∣tue is unfortunate it looks the larger for the Clouds we see it throughThere is a Courage in Adversity that can put Fortune out of CountenanceMen are not despicable by their Fate but by their Manner of support∣ing it The Lyon has more Majesty in his  Chains than when in the Forest His Fierce∣ness is reduc'd and soften'd by the Restraint of his Condition and what was  terrible  in him before becomes  venerable  by his Calamity  BUT we shou'd not only bear our Misfor∣tunes with  Patience  we shou'd sustain 'em too with  Silence  Complaints are  weak  Mens Weapons And there was something delicate and finely judg'd in the Conduct of a  Persian  Merchant I have read of who finding him∣self on the Brink of Ruin by a Race of Losses that befel him gave strict Orders to his Son that he shou'd speak of it to Nobody For otherwise said he of  One  Misfortune we shall make  TwoThe Loss itself which we com∣plain ofand our Enemy's rejoicing at it  BUT as the most perfect Pleasures in the World are always mix'd with Afflictions so the sharpest Afflictions have their Uses and their PleasuresA Man's best Friend is his  Enemy  Since by mortifying his Vanity he adorns his Nature with Humility and teaches him to shun the Practice of those Ill Qualities toward Others which he finds so unjust and hateful while he himself is oppress'd by them  BUT while I talk of Humility I blush at my own Pride who wou'd teach others a Sci∣ence which I am myself but a Learner inMy Reader in this Case must be so good as to compare me to a Blind Man with a Torch in his HandThough I see not my own Way I carry Light enough along with me to guide the Steps of those who follow me  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Pudet haec opprobria

not allow me to take the Air in the open Fields I measure my Landlady's Hall Floor so many Times for a Breathing that I can walk Twenty Miles without stirring out of my LodgingsI was meditating Yester∣day Morning in one of these reverted Peram∣bulations when I heard the Sound of a Horse's Feet on the Pavement before my Door which was follow'd by a loud rustick Whistle and a thumping against the Porch with the Handle∣end of a WhipI look'd out and was sa∣luted by a Country Servant of  Will Weather∣cock  's with this simple and hearty AddressThat  Master remember'd his Love to me and had sent him up with a Letter  I dispatch'd my Friend's  Courier  and shall lay before my Reader the Contents of this Intelligence  Dearest SIR  THE good Company at Sir  Portly  's are at a sad Loss in your Absence Mr  Tiresome  and our Friend  Tony  won't drink one another's Healths yet But Mr  Juniper  has done as strange a Cure upon Mr  Jyngle  as Mr  Jyngle  himself intends to do upon Sir  Clouterly Rumble    Tony  has never been right as he shou'd be since you made him so asham'd of shooting his Poetry at Ran∣dom He look'd very pale Yesterday and complain'd of a Pain in his Stomach There was something he said lay like a Load at his Heart and he had much ado to draw his Breath for itMr  Juniper  felt his Pulse and said he hop'd there was no Dan∣ger Asking him at the same Time If he had made no  Verses  for this Week past Mr  Jyngle  told him  Yes  and repeated six hun∣dred Lines of a Poem he has made a Begin∣ning in The Verses I must needs say sound∣ed as fine as ever I heard any But what I thought strange was that as soon as he had done Repeating Mr  Juniper  bid him  hem  and go chearfully about his Busi∣ness for his Oppression he said was re∣mov'dAnd it really prov'd as he saidMr  Jyngle  's Colour return'd immediately and he breathes as freely as ever he did  BUT I fancy for all this he is not quite cur'd yet His Distemper I doubt works inward and unless it has constant  Vent  may blow up into his Brain and do more Mischief than we are aware of For I ob∣serve though he  says  nothing the suppress'd Spring of his Fancy twitches his Eyebrows up and down and moves his Lips like a Rabbit'sHe has got an odd Whim toothe Effect to be sure of his Melancholy Of untying the Knots of People's Periwigs who happen to sit within Reach of him He will do the same by

of your Advice to Dearest Sir  Your most Faithful Servant  William Weathercock  THE Answer I return'd to this apprehensive Humanity of  Will Weathercock  was  That I cou'd determine nothing suddenly in so doubt∣ful a Case But I desir'd him to tell  Tony  the following Story the first Time he shou'd catch him at a WigKnot or an ApronString and from the Effects of it I might judge better  AN  Arabian  Physician of great Learning went to visit the  Caliph  who took Plea∣sure in discoursing with him concerning Dis∣eases and their Remedies The Physician was demonstrating the Necessity of Binding Madmen to prevent Danger from their Ex∣travagance and the  Caliph  who sat involv'd in the profoundest Attention had insensibly apply'd his Fingers to the Bottom of the Doctor's Gown which finding a little un∣stitch'd he had ript it to the very Girdle The Doctor observing it made a Pause in his NarrationThe  Caliph  then ask'd him By what Tokens they knew when it was Time to Bind a Madman  We bind him  answer'd the Physician  when he pulls People's Cloaths to Pieces without the smallest Pro∣vocation  June  the th  SIR  GOING last  Sunday  in the Afternoon to a Church not far

and useful OfficeThe  Psalms  which were sung plainly in the simple Worship of our Forefathers are now most musically  warbled  by gay powder'd Choristers who have their Ears refin'd by  Opera  with

House with no other In∣tention than to read over the PLAINDEALER But the Answer I always had was  They did not take in the Paper  At last his Custo∣mers so often ask'd for it that he was asham'd to be

dis∣appointed by his Avarice And just so ma∣ny PLAIN DEALERS I am determin'd to pocket up that I may bring Things to Balance Af∣ter that I will content myself to carry off in my  Memory  what I now bring away in my  Pocket  And this is the true State of Mr  D B  's Complaint to you  But since  CoffeeMen  must be murmuring I will put you in a Way to mortifie some of the  Backward Ones  of that

strange Thing to consider how little Encouragement  Honest Industry  meets with  ONE Evening last Week a Beau with a great BlackBag at his Back was set down out of a StageCoach and fixing his Eye upon my Pole put his Hand to his Beard and came directly to my Door as if he meant I shou'd Shave him But as soon as he read my  Rate  that was written on my  Show Board  he turn'd short upon his Heel and cry'd out with a silly Oath  "That  Six Pence  he thought was too little for a clean Shav∣ing But if a Man must pay for being  flea'd  a  Penny  was too much in Conscience  I WAS quite out of Heart at this unex∣pected Return for falling the Price of my Practice And my poor Wife who over∣heard it as she sat at work fell a crying at the IllNature of it But presently we heard a jolly Voice in the Street  Come let us go inI will encourage this Honest Fellow though I have been shav'd once to Day already  So there came into my Shop a grave welldress'd Gentleman and a pretty Youth with him He was kind and talk'd very familiar to me and had so goodhumour'd a Face that I lov'd dearly to look upon him When I had done with him he said that I had the soft Sweep of your  Turkish Barbers  and as he was going out of my Shop he gave me a Crown Piece and told me  "That such Industri∣ous Men as I ought to be paid as we  de∣serv'd  and not as we  expected  And that no body else shou'd  Shave  him as long as his Beard grew in  London  AS soon as he was gone my Wife fell a crying againBut this Time it was for  Joy  That in spite of  Beaux  and  BlackBags  there is some good  Nature  left in the

National Fisheries  Are all convincing Instances that no Nation under Heaven have so fix'd an Aversion to  Novelty  which yet every Body is imputing to us as the Reigning Humour of our Coun∣try  BUT we have a Present Example that will confirm my Remark and for ever put to Si∣lence those who accuse us of the Love of Novelty I mean the new Practice of  Ino∣culating the SmallPox  on Bodies purposely prepar'd to receive it So to prevent the usual Danger and Malignancy of that Distemper and sustain it without the Terror the Fatali∣ty and the Sorrow which have heretofore gone along with it  IT was a generous Undertaking in that Pub∣lickspirited Member of the  Royal Society  who resolving by  clear Matter of Fact  to establish or explode this Practice has with an unwea∣ried Application and the most stedfast Impar∣tiality inform'd himself of its Success through∣out all Parts of the Kingdom and given the World an Account of it in his Pamphlet late∣ly publish'd A Treatise which deserves the Eye and most careful Consideration of every Parent who has  Reason  or who wou'd save a Favourite Child the promis'd Comfort of  his Life from being snatch'd away perhaps in its Bloom by the Sweep of this Distemper  IT is demonstrated in the mention'd Trea∣tise from a Forty Year's Examination of the Bills of Mortality  'That the SmallPox car∣ries off at least  one  in every  six  of all whom it seizes in the  natural  Way whereas not one in  fifty  scarce one in many  hundreds  of those who receive it by  Inoculation  have been found to die under it  THE whole Number of Persons who have been so much as suspected to owe their Deaths to it ever since its first Introduction in  Eng∣land  amounts to  Nine  onlyThey are all nam'd in the Printed Account and there is scarce one among them for whose Death a Clearer Cause than the Inoculation is not assign'd and attested by the very Physicians and Surgeons who directed the OperationSo that Providence seems to have guided and enlighten'd  Art  in this Practice to assist and relieve  Nature  for the Preservation of the Human Species  YET with what Violence and Malice has it not been rail'd at and oppos'dHow many False Affirmations have we seen with unblushing Boldness insulting Truth in our Publick NewsPapersNay the Pulpits too have trembled under the Zeal of  Reverend Railers  who in the holy Blindness of their Passion have shewn us  Job  upon his Dung∣hill  inoculated  for the  SmallPox  by the  De∣vil  of a Surgeon  IT has been represented as a  Wilful Mur∣der  A new and wicked Presumption An Assault on the Prerogative of Heaven And a taking  God's own  Work out of his Hands to be mended by  Man's  Arrogance  BUT the Common Arguments however des∣picable give me Diversion and EntertainmentWhen I hear a pious Old Woman wisely wondering  What this World would come to  and concluding her Remarks with this great Maxim of Resignation that  God's own Time is best  I compare this Force of Female Rea∣soning to the Representation which a late Writer tells us The old  Boyars  or Grandees of  Russia  gravely made to the Present  Czar  when he attempted a Communication by Dig∣ing a Canal between the  Volga  and the  Tanais    "  The Design  they said  was Great  But they humbly conceiv'd it  Impious  For  since God had made the Rivers to run one Way Man ought not to turn them Another  IT is an establish'd Rule amongst Game∣sters That  Losers shou'd have leave to speak  And for this Reason I rather pity than grow angry with an unmarried Prude or Coquet when I catch 'em Railing at Inoculation with a Thousand  Excuses  for it in their  Faces  As it is a Comfort to the Miserable to have Companions in their Misery so it must be a Provocation to these Fair  Invalids  to hear of a Preservative for other's Beauty when it is too late to save their own by it  YET these good Ladies unmindful that they carry about with them the Cause of their own Peevishness treat an innocent Practice when they join the  Chorus  of  Railers  as the  Indian  did the LookingGlass which he found on the SeaSideHe was frightfully Ugly and starting back from his own Image threw away the Glass in great Rage with this com∣fortable Observation  I might have guess'd thou wert good for nothing Thou would'st not have been left here else  IT is the Observation of some Historian but I forgot where I met with it That  Eng∣land has ow'd to Women the greatest Blessings she has been distinguish'd by  In the Case we are now upon this Reflection will stand justifiedWe are indebted to the Reason and the Courage of a  Lady  for the Introduction of this Art which gains such Strength in its Progress that the Memory of its Illustrious Foundress will be render'd Sacred by it to future Ages  THIS Ornament of her Sex and Country who ennobles her own  Nobility  by her Learn∣ing Wit and Vertues accompanying her Con∣sort into  Turkey  observ'd the Benefit of this Practice with its Frequency even among those obstinate  Praedestinarians  and brought it over for the Service and the Safety of her Native  England  where she consecrated its first Effects on the Persons of her own fine Children And has already receiv'd this Glory from it  "That the Influence of her Example has reach'd as high as the Blood Royal"  And  our noblest and most antient Families in Confirmation of her happy Judgment add the daily Experience of those who are most Dear to them  I HAVE seen a short Poetical Essay on the Occasion we are now treating of I wou'd say if I meant the Verses an  Encomium  they shou'd be envied for

Force of the Author's Fancy took its  Turn  from the  Pagan System  and does  Apollo  as much Honour as the  Lady  who is worth a Thousand of him But it is an uncommon Misfortune to her Genius  "That the only Thing in the World worth knowing and not known to  her  is  her own prodigious Excellence  So she is nei∣ther able nor willing to describe it herself and no Verse but her own can soar high

where the  Subject  is of Weight and Dig∣nity  THERE is I know a  pert  Species of  Pane∣gyrick  which has been admir'd in the Exam∣ples of  Balzac Voiture  and other  French  Writers who when they wou'd praise  Kings  and  Heroes  took 'em ironically to  Task  and  chid  'em by way of  Commendation  But to speak like a PLAIN DEALER such familiar and smart  Encomiums  imply something like a Sense of superior Qualities in the overconscious Bestowers of 'emSome of the Verses just now hinted at have a little too much of the  Sportive  but nothing of the  French Arro∣gance  Then bravely fair

surpriz'd like a Flash of Lightning where instead of being the  profess'd Subject  it had been struck out  unexpectedly  As it is it looks like Trifling and misrepresents the Author as not charm'd into  Reverence  of the Worth he celebrates It speaks him Regard∣less and but half  Intent  and is like trip∣ping antickly over a DrawingRoom when it is prepar'd for the Steps of  Majesty  IF ever this Remark shou'd fall in the way of that Excellent Writer and he shou'd not himself think as I do I shall fear I have been mistaken But It is the Duty of every Man when he assumes the  Critick  to speak frankly his Opinion what is an  Error  and what an  Excellence  that his Reasons being weigh'd by the Reader's Impartiality may con∣tribute to produce that  Judgment  which is the sole good End of Criticism  BUT to return to the Lady from whose extensive Benevolence we receiv'd the Art we have been speaking ofIt is a Godlight De∣light that her Reflection must be conscious of when she considers to whom we owe  "That many Thousand  British Lives  will be sav'd every Year to the Use and Comfort of their Country after a General Establish∣ment of this Practice"  A  Good  so last∣ing

a young WidowWoman that was bred and born in  Wapping  and had one of the Best of Husbands that was Master of as good a Ship as ever us'd the  GuineyTrade  But he dy'd in his last Voyage as he was bringing Home a great  Elephant  for a  Token  And I have taken a strange Fancy to the Beast because he puts me in Mind of my poor HusbandMost of our  AfricanCompany  have been to see him and they all agree there is  more in him  than in a whole Court of  Assistants  BUT for all he looks so big there is no Manner of Harm in him He is as Tame as one of us Women and plays twenty clever Tricks to make People merry that make much of himOne cou'dn't forbear laughing tho' one lay a dying to see how the goodnatur'd clumsy Beast will dance  Moll Peatly  He will so catch up his Feet  and frisk round in a small Compass and thump the Floor to keep Time and move his Backside to the Musick and in short your other End o' the Town DancingMasters are  no Body at all  to him  HE plays at  TrapBall  in a RopeWalk by our House and strikes out the Ball with his Snout and is the comicalest poor Crea∣ture alive to be sureA Gunner and a Man of War's Chaplain of my Acquaintance are now very busy in teaching him to  dance upon the Ropes  and I must needs say he comes on very towardly only he look'd a little silly at first and tumbled off when they cry'd  Jump for the King  and cou'dn't keep steady for the Life of himHe cracks Nuts with his Nose and makes a woeful Splutter when he gets Loose among the HerbWomens AppleBasketsAll my Neighbours love him and tell me that he will bring in a world of Money if I would but  make a Show of him  Pray what is your Opinion And whereabouts do you think it will be best for me to  set up  with him In answering this you will do an Act of great Kindness to  Your afflicted humble Servant  SUSAN SOFTLY  Honourable SIR  OBSERVING by some of your  PlainDealers  that you are a great Admirer of the  Czar  of  Muscovy  I humbly presume to acquaint you that I am lately come out of his Country and have brought with me a Commodity call'd a  Russian Bear  He has shar'd very largely in the Improvements of his Fellow Subjects for he can fiddle as well as any Body he sits bolt up on End and holds his  Kit  in one Paw with the Butt End against his Belly and with his Fiddle∣stick in the other Paw  tunes it away  after the  Italian  Manner with his Head o' one side all in Raptures at his own HarmonyIt wou'd do your Heart good to look at him when he is splitting a Note into  Graces  For he shakes his Nose and his Paw together with such a Variety of melodious  Quavering  that his  Ear  must be confess'd as  delicate  as if he had been a  Subscriber  to the  Opera  BUT there is one Thing that I take to be a very particular Happiness to him He looks when he is Grave for all the World like that Ingenious  Swiss  Gentleman that has so many diverting Fancies to get Money by making Ladies and Gentlemen merry together If they were to be dress'd both alike I am confident there wou'd be no knowing 'em asunder May be that may go a great Way toward making the poor Thing's FortuneI have him here in  Town but he is out of Business at pre∣sent so if you cou'd but be so kind as to put him in some Way of Preferment he shall wait on you where you please and enter∣tain you with a  Sample Lesson  Which is all that offers at this Time from Honourable SIR  Yours to Command  JONAS QUEER  I TACK this extraordinary Pair of  Epistles  together because of a manifest Resemblance in their Contents and for that I am desirous to promote a  Union  between Mrs  Softly  and Mr  Queer  Their  Beasts  at least if not themselves must be subscribed into a  JointStock  for the better carrying on of their TradeThey may afterwards debate at Leisure concerning the  Incorporation  of their  Persons  But certain it is that two Animal Artists of such Sagacity as both the  African  and the  Russian  Stranger cou'd never have honour'd  London  with their Residence at a properer Time than this Or with a fairer Promise for their own Benefit  SOME  Statesmen  who look  deep  into Nati∣onal Consequences and discern at a Distance the Fate of  Mightiness  and  Ministry  have pre∣tended to foresee the sudden Downfall of  Opera  Who knows if such a melancholy Revolu∣tion shou'd befall the Polite World but these two qualify'd Performers may take Possession  of that deserted Theatre and under the Au∣spices of so noble and so unanimous a Board of Directors outdo even the surprizing Things which have already been heard and seen there  OR suppose it were  yet a Winter  before the  Haymarket  will be in a Condition to receive them They cannot fail in the mean Time to meet with more than reasonable Encourage∣ment if they but apply themselves to the Ma∣nagers of either of our Theatres In one of which they labour under such a want of good Actors that two such accomplish'd Comedians having the Advantage too of being  foreign  Ones may certainly make their own Terms if they are inclinable to  strengthen the Youngest Company  Or if Fortune against her usual Custom most propitious to her old Favourites shou'd dispose their Choice another Way they may be entertain'd as  Friends  and  Allies  up∣on the Foot of wellpaid Subsidies the Com∣manding Officers of those  Veterans  entering lately with much Vivacity upon New Plans of Action which fall immediately within the Genius of our fourfooted  Virtuoso  's  HAVING barely touch'd this Hint for the Service of my Correspondents who are Per∣sons of great Parts and Industry I come now to say a Word or two in my own Person to the Stages  MUCH of the Summer is yet before us and  Winter  being the Season of our Theatri∣cal Campaigning I shall prepare myself against  that Time to take the Field at their first Marching and move with one or other of the Bodies during the whole Course of their Operations My Readers may then expect to be entertain'd from my private Journal with the Good or Bad Discipline of both Armies and the Personal Conduct of their Generals in the Exercises Evolutions Sallies Stratagems or Engagements they shall at any Time be concern'd inLet 'em therefore stand  warn'd  and assure themselves that I shall animadvert on their Behaviour with a Frankness they have been little us'd to and lay 'em Open like a PLAIN DEALER  BUT to enter on another Subject I have receiv'd several Letters from the Female Part of my Care to complain of my  Odious Title  so they call it of PLAIN DEALERThey had  heard of me it seems but did not dream I had any Thing in meThey took my Business to have been PoliticksThey little thought me the Man they find meInstead of Humour and Wit they look'd for Bluntness and Malice from a surly old Fellow that was setting him∣self up for a Cynick  with a great deal more to the same Purpose But one arch Flirt among the Rest is for  forcing  me to  declare  myself that People may  know what to make of me  She is at a Loss how to think or what to say of my Papers and can neither  like  nor  dislike  with any Manner of  Certainty  till she hears whether I am a  Whig  or a  Tory  She adds in a Postscript  "That perhaps I may think  indifferently of  both  and pretend to an Im∣pudent  Neutrality  like the Old Grasier in our Civil Wars who when he was met on the Road by Either of the opposite Parties and ask'd  For King Or for Parliament  told 'em  For Neither 'till both were wiser  THE  Hotheads  and  Testimonies  of this pre∣sent Generation think it a Disgrace to their Vivacity not to be as briskly in the Wrong as their Ancestors And I pity very heartily the Condition of the King's poor Subject who has sent me the following Letter  Master  PLAIN DEALER  I WISH you wou'd lend me but one Lash or two of your PLAIN DEALING for some Folks in RedCoats and Others in no Coats at all For if Things go on as they stand now an honest Man won't be able to travel the Road  pro  and  con  for a Set of silly BusyBodies that must be medling with us about Things that we have other Matters to do than to think of For you must know Master  PlainDealer  if you please That I drive a peaceable Waggon of my own and have done so these Thirty Years without being molested in my Calling till now lately that a Pack of strange People have got a Whim into their Heads  to make us Englishmen all of one Mind  But if ever they bring it about I will be hang'd for 'em  ABOUT Six a Clock in the Morning on the  Nine and Twentieth Day of  May  last  I and my Waggon were met near a WoodSide by a Knot of fifty or sixty roaring Fellows stuck all over with  Oaken Boughs  and loaded with Branches of the sameThey stopt me in the Road to know  Whe∣ther I lov'd the Memory of King  Charles  the Second  I said  Yes with all my Soul  At that Word they fell a dancing and set up a loud  Huzzaing  waving their Hats and their Boughs till my Team became frighted and took 'em all to be bewitch'd and was within a Hair's Breadth of running away with my Waggon Then they hand∣ed me a two Quart BrandyBottle and bid me drink a Dram  To the Glorious Memory of the Restoration  And as soon as I had got it down they gave a great Shout again stuck my Horses and my Waggon all over with Green Boughs said I was a  very honest Fellow  and had a  Heart of English Oak  And so we parted with much Ceremony and Satisfaction on both Sides  BUT before Eleven the same Day as I was driving into a Town where my Waggon was to  Dine  there came up in a great Rage seven or eight of the Troopers that were quarter'd there and ask'd me  What I bush'd out my Horses for  I told 'em  To drive Flies away  But they said I was a  Jacobite Rascal  that my  Horses  were guilty of  HighTreason  and my Waggon ought to be  hang'd  I answer'd That it was already  drawn  and within a Yard or two of be∣ing  Quarter'd  but as to being hang'd It was a Compliment we had no Occasion for and therefore desir'd them to take it back again and keep it in their own Hands 'till they had an Opportunity to make Use of itI had no sooner spoke these Words but they fell upon me like Thun∣der stript my Cattle in a Twinkling and beat me black and blue with my own Oaken Branches  THIS went off and I thought no more of it 'till the  Tenth Day of  June  came  I was then Inn'd in  London  and from where my Waggon lay in  Holborn  I went to  Soho Square  to deliver a little Parcel that I had brought up for my Landlord's LadyShe order'd That I should have as much Strong Beer as I cou'd drink and that I should drink a Health to  her Inclinations  She smil'd at me and was so kind as to give me out of her own Hand a fine  Nosegay of White Roses  I was very proud of my Nosegay for my Lady's Sake that had given it me And went along the Street smelling to it thinking all the Way as I walk'd How pretty it looks in your  Gentry  to be so free and goodnatur'd with a poor Man as I am When all of a sudden a Scarecrow lean Man in a fine lac'd Coat snatch'd it out of my Hand and another Gentleman in red who was along with Him  lent me a Cut cross the Shoulders with a cursed smarting Cane and told meThat he would teach such a dirty Dog as I was to be smelling to  Tory Roses  IF I could have got one of these fine Fel∣lows all alone with me in my Waggon I shou'd have made him  know his Driver  But as it was I thought it best to shew him a good Pair of Heels for itWhich of us might have  run  fastest in a fair Field of Battle I can but give a guess atUp∣on this Occasion it was  my  Luck to be nimblest and outstrip Both of 'emI don't know for my Part what to make of all these Doings They are strange Times we live in and as I love to be musing when I have nothing else to do methinks very often as I travel along the Road from one End of the Kingdom to another and find the People of such different Notions I fancy my Waggon and I are moving upon a Draft Board  Old England  is turn'd  Chec∣quer Work  and mix'd Black and White all over So wishing Things wou'd mend I rest  Master  PLAIN DEALER  Your humble Servant to Command  RALPH DOBBYN  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Verane te facies Verus mihi nuncius affers  Vivo equidem vitamque extrema per omnia duco  Ne dubita nam vera vides  VIR  Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse Supremum  Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora  FRIDAY  July    I MADE a Visit the other Day to a Gen∣tleman who has a CountryHouse near  London  and while we refresh'd ourselves with a Social Glass in a Summer Bower which he has rais'd above the Corner of his GardenWall I observ'd him to fix his Eyes with much Attention on the Gate of a stately Building that stood on the opposite Side of the RoadThe Mistress said he of that fine House has been charming me all this Morning in a Poem which was written in Praise of her Extraordinary Beauty by a very celebrated  English  GeniusThe warm and lively Imagination of the Poet has plac'd her exactly before me I feel methinks the Influence of her Eyes I am inchanted by her Air and MovementBut I lose my self in Rapture while I seem to gaze upon  that Spring of Youth which he describes with so much Wantonness That  living thinking  Bloom that quickens her soft Languor and adds Health and Joy to LovelinessBut seeLook yonder The very Charmer comes This this is she This gay young wish'd ador'd dear Masterpiece of Nature whom I have been reading of with so much Transport  I STARTED up in great Amazement and inflam'd by eager Curiosity look'd out to see this ProdigyBut I beheld no other than a thin wither'd stooping old Lady whom Two Servants with much seeming Difficulty supported and were leading along between them toward a Coach that waited for her at the Gate Her Head and both her Hands shook strongly with the Palsey but every other Part seem'd motionless and quite insen∣sibleI sigh'd at the Appearance of so mortifying an Object And recall'd my Eyes from aking at it to fix 'em reproachfully upon my Friend for his illpointed Levity in sporting with the Weakness and Misery of Human NatureYet  This  said he  was once  so chang'd as we now see her that Di∣vine that Godlike that resistless Miracle whom to contemplate in  Dryden  's warm De∣scription of her Influence when the Hearts of a gay Monarch and a Court of Rival Lovers were the Trophies of her Beauty  Who  cou'd think that Time wou'd thus re∣duce her to a  Contradiction  of all those flou∣rishing  Attractions which though perish'd in the chang'd Original will bloom for ever in the Poet's Picture  I PROTEST the sudden Shock which this malicious Artfulness of my good Friend's Mo∣rality surpriz'd and struck me with quite damp'd and overwhelm'd my ChearfulnessI sicken'd at this  too near  and  naked  View of Life without its  Palliatives  I resolv'd to drink no moreYour Wine said I has lost its Relish and your Society is grown in∣sipid from the tingling Thoughts which you have fill'd me withSo rising for my Hat and Gloves I took my Leave abruptly and walk'd homeward cross the Fields oppress'd with musing Melancholy  I have not to this Moment lost the Weight of its Oppression and shall never cease to wonder That the  Young  reflect so seldom on the Shortness of their Spring when yet the  Old  are always near us and the  Younger  coming up behind to push us forward into WinterIt was a sharp and startling An∣swer  That  of the  Armenian  Beggar who leaning double on his Staff was ask'd by a young jesting Coxcomb How much that  Bow  had cost him For I wou'd be glad said he to buy one  Have Patience  answer'd the old Man  and if God prolongs your Life you will have as good a one for nothing  THERE is but one Thing Here that can deserve our constant Thoughts and that is the very Thing which we most hate to think of  What ought so frequently to busy our Remembrance as the only sure and unavoid∣able common Lot of ALL who ever liv'd who now do live or who shall live here∣afterWhere are now  Times past  We toil and strive and labour on through Life as if  to live  were our chief Business Unmindful all the while what empty Sha∣dows we are grasping at and for how short a Time and how uncertainly they can be Ours when we have gain'd them What is become of all those busy Bustlers who have liv'd and died before us Are they not vanished and forgotten They have made their Way thro' Life as an Eagle does through Air and their Path is clos'd up after them nor have they left a Track to follow by  TIME is the greatest of all  Deceivers  but deceives us without  flattering  usIt has a Tongue in every Steeple and points its Finger to the Dial's Shadow to alarm and give us Notice But we neglect its hourly Summons we trust its gentle Pace against the Harshness of its Warning Yet were we wise we should think Time a smooth but precipitate Current that carries us down to Death whether we are bound thither or no And  He  will always have the roughest Pas∣sage who instead of gliding quietly will be struggling to swim against it  LIFE has nothing that is truly desirable but the Presence of those we love yet this of all its Pleasures is most precarious and  unstableAre we charm'd by the Power of  Beauty  Let us learn from such an Object as the once blooming Lady whom I have been speaking of that it is a false and fluid ProspectIt is chang'd since Yesterday and will be further chang'd Tomorrow  All  that is  Ours  is mutable We still in∣deed  live on  but we are no longer what we have been nor can we continue what we are Though the River is still known by its old Name its Waters Today are not the same Waters that were Yesterday Not our Blood alone is flowing and in constant Motion our Faces Strength Health Comforts Fears Joys Miseries and Dangers all move and mix us in one Gulph  Eternity  I KNOW nothing so  ridiculous  as what is call'd being  serious  nor is any thing more  idle  than what we usually term  Business  We wou'd be  fortunate lov'd fear'd great  every thing but what we  shou'd be  For whoever in this Life proposes to be com∣pleatly happy hopes to build like the Men of  Babel  and wou'd raise a Pile  as high as Heaven  without Foundation to erect it on The World is too narrow to allow Dimensions for a  Basis  where the wildintended Height is so unproportionably extravagant  The  Mahometans  who affect after the an∣cient Manner of the  Eastern  Writers to ex∣press their Moral Doctrine in a kind of pro∣verbial Chain of Parallels say there are  six  Things which a wise Man will ground no  Hopes onThe Colour of a Cloud be∣cause imaginary The Friendship of the Co∣vetous because mercenary The Love of Women because inconstant Beauty be∣cause frail Praise because airy And the Pleasures of this World because deceitful  IT is equally to be wonder'd at since Life is so little valuable and Death so certain and unavoidable  "That we should be so unrea∣sonably fond of the One and so fruitlessly afraid of the Other"  There is no Harbour on this Side  Death  And the nearer we ap∣proach to those shining Follies which we pur∣sue with such dangerous Eagerness the more we multiply our Cares and distract and weary our own Purposes The whole Earth is not broad enough for two proud Fools to quarrel in whereas  Death  is the End of Contest the weary Man's Repose the great Man's Glory the sick Man's Health the poor Man's Com∣fort and a Shelter against Wrongs and Mi∣sery  SINCE a Traveller can enjoy Pleasure by often thinking on his Journey's End while he is yet but upon the Road toward it why might not Death be made familiar to us and disrob'd of its false Terrors by accustoming ourselves to look out for it To acquaint our selves with it at a Distance during our Jour∣ney through Life to it Life is properly a Journey but differs from our other Journeys of less Consequence in this surprizing Parti∣cular  "That we are travelling as fast while  we are sleeping and intend no Progress as when we are awake and know we are moving  LIFE then being a Journey Death I think may be consider'd as an  Inn  at the  Land's End  And since the Traveller when he comes thither is still oblig'd to go farther and must set out for Discoveries upon a deep and unknown Ocean if he takes not along with him fit Provisions for his Voyage he must be either a Fool or a Madman  THE Difference between the  Great  Man and the  Good  Man is never so plainly seen as when they both come to  die  Then the one shuts his Eyes and steps trembling and in the Dark into the Dreadfulness of Uncer∣tainty While the other smiles with Joy up∣on the Enlargement of his opening Prospect and comes out of a miry Labyrinth into Daylight and a boundless  Champian  I sometimes take Pleasure to consider the Birth of Man as a Commitment of his Soul to Pri∣son where during the Life of the Body it is chain'd short and can move but a creeping Pace and in limited and dusky Stages But it is set free and unfetter'd by Death and at one Spring reaches HeavenSuch Dis∣charge is to the Soul what Light is to the Eye when it opens Colours and Objects which before were conceal'd in Darkness  Thus then when it is said we  die  we are rather  born  into real Being we are infran∣chis'd by the Grant of Death and incorpo∣rated  among the Millions upon Millions who have died before us Those we leave are a Number very small and inconsiderable in Comparison with those we go to The Patri∣archs the Prophets the Apostles the heroick Conquerors the shining Poets of Antiqui∣ty and the whole assembled Congress of longknown and glorious Characters who have flourish'd from the World's Creati∣on are to be the Company to whose fami∣liar Converse  Death  will introduce usAnd that we may add one charming Hope to warm and sweeten all the rest  There  too we shall perhaps embrace and be restor'd to those lost Friends we lov'd most dearly and whom we never more expected to have met with  BUT I will now relieve my Readers from the Severity of these Reflections by entertaining them with a Copy of Verses which I am assur'd were really written to a Lady eminent for her Wit and Beauty by a Gentleman who thought it no Disgrace to her Loveliness to mix his Admiration of it with the Memory that she was mortal  To  CLELIA  in the  COUNTRY  On the pulling down St  Martin  's Church  WHILE from the noisy Crowd you lean retir'd  In silent Shades by Love of Thought inspir'd  I vex'd by varied Cares to Business chain'd  Mourn'd your lost Converse and in Town remain'd  Dark as the Midnight World your Sunshine gone  Guideless in sullen Gloom I wander'd on  Passion's wild Influence ebb'd and flow'd my Mind  As Seas drive diff'rent with the changing Wind  But to what Point soe'er my Will was bound  In vain I turn'd th'unresting Compass round  Doubtful a while the wav'ring Needle hung  Then trembling backward to your Image sprung  Pensive I view'd a Sacred Pile of late  Which falls like Man to rise in nobler State  The Doors thrown wide it seem'd  unveil'd  to lie  And rev'rend Ruin struck my startled Eye  Ent'ring amidst the busy Hammers Sound  I saw Time's dusty Trophies scatter'd round  Each violated Pillar stood bedew'd  And wept in solemn Grief a Fate so rude  From Tombs by Force disjoin'd reluctant Stones  Roll'd mix'd with Clouds of Dust and human Bones  From faithless Walls defac'd Inscriptions fled  And to long Night consign'd the nameless Dead  The Pews pale Squares in their whole lengthen'd Row  Gave Way and open'd a sad Scene below  Beauty Youth Wealth and Pow'r reduc'd to Clay  Larded with Bones yet moist unshelter'd lay  Remnants of Eyeless Skulls with concave Stare  Mock'd the proud Looks which living Charmers wear  Coffins rose broke unfaithful to their Trust  And Flesh flew round me in unjointed Dust  Scarce a short Span beneath that op'ning Floor  Where kneeling Charmers  pray'd  the Week before  Where Forms like Yours rejoic'd th' admiring Eye  Forms once like Yours in naked Atoms lie  O Fate of failing Life O flatt'ring Dream  What wintry Sunshine is Thy shadowy Gleam  Thus while I mus'd Thy Soul approach'd my Ear  Thy softwing'd Soul that always hovers near  See'st Thou it sigh'd How these sad Relicks lie  And do'st Thou fear that  CLELIA  thus can die  No she's  All Mind  and Her immortal Name  Eluding Death's short Reach shall tread on Fame  Tongues yet unthoughtof  CLELIA  shall adorn  And charm adoring Nations yet unborn  Heroes at whose Resolves the World will shake  Shall treat thy Sex with Rev'rence for thy Sake  And each fair Tyrant who wou'd  Empress  be  Form but  One  Wish  "  To Think and Look like Thee  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Ostendit Tibi Te  HOR  MONDAY  July    AMONG some extraordinary Epistles which have been lately sent me I had the Honour to receive the following from the Right Worshipful Mr Alderman  Blunder  But not thinking fit to reply to it explicite∣ly I have only taken it  Ad Referendum  as  our good Neighbours the  Dutch States  re∣ceive Petitions which they find themselves inclinable to answer with the political Elo∣quence of  saying nothing  SIR  I And Mr  Weathercock  were at a Tavern with  Ned Volatile  who may have  Wit  for any thing I know to the contrary But as for  Money  I dare be positive that the first Time he saves  Sixpence  will be when he has but a  Groat  in his Pocket And yet this extravagant young Fellow as I have lately been well inform'd has the under∣hand Impudence to  make Love to my Daugh∣ter  A Whim took him while we were merry together that he must set himself forsooth to  Scribbling  Presently it comes into my Head that he was writing a LoveLetter to my Daughter And so pretending to mind nothing but Talking I lean'd back in my Chair and overlook'd what he was doingBut as if the young Rogue had had Eyes in his Elbows he broke off what he had begun and writ thus in a new Place  If an impertinent Old Fellow that sits by me did not overlook what I am writing I should have told you a plea∣sant Secret  I let him alone as far as this but then being thoroughly provok'd at his calling me Names I told him round∣ly  That he was a Lyar and an unmannerly young Coxcomb to pretend to write Folks  Word that I overlook'd his Letter when I had not so much as seen a single Word he had been writing  The only Answer he gave me was to laugh till he tumbled out of his Chair But I wou'd have him to know that this is no laughing Matter Mr  Wea∣thercock  says he is in the  Wrong  But that he was in the  Right  of it too I don't much like this Decision because I can't tell what to make of it so I resolv'd to refer it to you and pray tell the pert young Jack∣anapes  his own  which is the Needful  I rest Yours to serve you  HABAKKUK BLUNDER  PS  Mr  Thomas Tiresome  has something to say which he will write by the same Hand  Worthy SIR  MY good Friend the Alderman saying he was to write to you upon extraor∣dinary Business makes me lay hold on this Opportunity to ask a little of your wise Advice what I shall do with the Sum of Twelve Hundred and Ninety Three Pounds Sterling which are come back upon my Hands by selling out my  India Stock  very seasonably upon this melancholy Story that is whisper'd about so cautiously concern∣ing the  Great Mogul  's entering into an Alli∣ance against Prince  Tockmas  and the  Czar  of Muscovy  My Broker is for  SouthSea Dipping  Because now says he it is LowWater in those Parts and the Danger of Drowning not half so great as it was for∣merly But I believe I shall stay till their New House is quite finish'd and then perhaps I may for any thing I see to the contrary stay still a little longer For the young King of  Spain  seems to have more in his Head than ordinary They say he is  angry with the Irish  already because of the Bustle they made at  Cadiz  lately and if the  next he falls out with  shou'd be the  English SouthSea  will go near to pinch for itBesides who can tell you know what may happen upon the Choice of this  New Pope  He won't let People wear good Cloaths And some of our publick Prints say that he is so horribly covetous that he makes the Cardinals go baldheaded to save the Charge of buying Perriwigs Pray what can be his Meaning in all this but only to ruin the  Protestant InInterest  and make  Stocks fall  to destroy  Trade  in downright Spite to  Old England  The poor BaysMakers at  Colchester  seem to suffer for it already And the Weavers that are  Up  about  Columpton  have much ado to be kept  Quiet  at itThen again What could the  French King  mean by calling home the  Marshal de Villeroy  I make no Doubt but there is some Mischief in  that  tooIn short while Things stand in this  ticklish Posture a wary Man will think twice before he runs into the  Stocks  Indeed if the King of  Prussia  should come over there might be some Reason for ven∣turing But as it is I am afraid I must lay out my Money in  Lottery Tickets  For when all comes to all  that  is the only  abso∣lute Certainty  Knowing you to be a longheaded Man would be glad to have your Opinion in a Matter of such extraordinary Difficulty  Your Friend  THOMAS TIRESOME  Mr  PLAIN DEALER  I AM a good agreeable young Woman of a very  Loyal  Family and have a most mortal Aversion for a  Roundhead  It gives me no small Pain to observe how fast they increase in this present Generation Pray make publick Proclamation in the Name of  Us our ownself  and many Hundred unsub∣scribing  Spinsters who adhere to our Opinion  "That a Fat Chubby Face with a Short Thick Neck and Broad Big Shoulders were never made for  Nightcap Perriwigs  of the New Scarecrow Model that shew the  Ears  a little of the  Longest  but all the rest of the Head as  Round  and as  Empty  as a Cypher"  Give the  Great  O's this Hint from  Your humble Servant  ARAMINTA SQUEAMISH  Old  PLEASANT ONES  THIS comes to acquaint you That my dear Spouse is taken sick of a sudden and stands in need to the utmost Degree of that Experience in  MindMidwifery  which you gave out Bills about in your XXVIIth PaperPray let Doctor  Jyngle  be sent for immediately And beg him to come away whether his Chariot is brought home or noWe must have him though he comes in a WheelbarrowThe Bearer knows how to bring him And pray let his  Emetics  be such as will work deep and fetch up  Choler  as well as  Flegm  Rage∣ing  Jealousy  is the Distemper And if the  Bitter  and  Green  and  Yellow  that lie as low as my poor  Fubsy  's Heart is not all brought away by it he had e'en as good  give her a Caudle  BUT unless Doctor  Jyngle  has better Phy∣sick for sick Minds than those  Poetical Pills  which you prescribe out of the  Classi∣cal Dispensatory  I shall have little Faith in his  Modus  of  Practising  I have try'd to no Purpose an admirable  Modern Doctor  who has given us finer  Recipe's  of that Kind for Cure of either the Hot or Cold  Fits of  Jealousy  than the whole College of your  Ancients Greeks  and  Romans  put to∣getherI love him at my Heart and have most of his Lectures  without Book  And I am sure he is profoundly skill'd in my dear Love's Distemper by this feeling Force with which he speaks of it  Oh JealousyAll other Storms are  Calms  To  Thee  Thou  Conflagration  of the Soul  THAT Word  Conflagration  is the very Picture of my  Fubsy  's SymptomsI had prepared from the Salutary Works of this learned Gentleman a healing  Linctus  that I thought infallible if my afflicted Deary cou'd be persuaded but to apply her Tongue to it now and then in order to dulcify her picquant Palate when the acid Particles should rise too vehemently I had got it ready written upon a Sheet of her own gilt Paper and the last Time she was taken I gave it kindly into her Hands and desired her to apply it moderately She look'd it over with great Composure and I began to conceive such Hope that I took up an untasted  Sillabub  that had just been set be∣fore us and intreated her if the Physick was too bitter that she would wash down the Taste of it with a Sip or two of that emollient Sweetner But the Spout was no sooner within a Foot of her pretty Lips when the  Conflagration  abovemention'd  blaz'd out at both her Eyes and with a frightful flaming Face she tore the  Recipe  in a thousand Pieces and burnt so strong and so outragiously that fearing I should be scorch'd as she flew toward me and not be∣ing just then provided with one of Mr  God∣frey  's  Chymical Extinguishers  I had no Way left to quench the Fire but by Affusion of my  Sillabub  which very fortunately  put her out  by the Copiousness of its Adhesion But I was so frighted at the Ebullition that ensued immediately upon it that I ran away as fast as I was able having left her a good deal cool'd and in a fair Way to be extin∣guish'd  I THOUGHT it proper to give you this Intelligence how far I have fail'd that Doctor  Jyngle  may come prepar'd with more powerful and searching RemediesLet him make but a thorough Cure and I'll warrant him we do his Business There are NineandThirty Ladies of Quality of my  Fubsy  's particular Acquaintance who are All down at this very Time of the selfsame Distemper and All taken too with the  Conflagration  exactly as she her∣self is He shall never want good Patients if his  Emeticks  but go to the BottomI am in no small Impatience  Dear  PLEASANT ONES  Thine most Expectantly  GREGORY DINGLE  Knight  Oxford  July    Mr  PlainDealer  I HAVE a wonderful Piece of News for you and desire that you will apprize the World That  Wit  may be  worth some∣thing  when a little  Good Fortune  goes along with itMy  Muse  was so long my  Mistress  that I began to grow weary of her and she has been so kind in the very Nick as to help me to a  Wise  I had been in Love above three Years and never got three good Words from the dear Ty∣rant 'till I went a Fishing with her one hot Evening in the Middle of last MonthShe delighted much in Angling out of an old SummerHouse over a River that makes part of her own RoyaltyUpon these Occasions you must know I was always her  Humble Trout  and it was my Business to bait her Hooks and sit and read to her while she watch'd her Fishing Rods But that happy Evening abovemention'd I had upon a Hint out of Doctor  Donne  compos'd three little  Stanza's  and hiding the Paper they were waitten in betwixt the Leaves of one of the Volumes of  Dry∣den  's  Miscellanies  I read her the Title and Verses as if they had been part of the Print∣ed Collection  To a  LADY  who lov'd  ANGLING  SOme by the bending Reed's slow Aid  May boast th' unwary Fish betray'd  Others may finny Shoals beset  And sweep 'em with the treach'rous Net  But why shou'd  SYLVIA  use Deceit  Who is herself her own best Bait  Step but undress'd within the Brook  And smile at every needless Hook  Each willing Fish will round thee swim  Gladder to catch thee than thou him  Or if one Fish uncaught goes by  That Fish is Wiser far than I  She was taken with 'em as I cou'd wish and without dreaming that they were mine cry'd out to hear 'em again for nothing sure was ever so pretty But observing me very careful to conceal the Inside of the Book she snatch'd it out of my Hand and discovering her Mistake blush'd and cry'd  Pish  and look'd most charmingly sillyBut in short my Bait took so well that I have now got her on a Hook that she is never like to slip off from 'till one of us has done with Fishing in  this  World which has at present no happier Creature in it than  Your most fortunate Humble Servant  PETER TROUT  SIR  IT is said that  England  within this last Century is grown Richer and more Po∣tent beyond Comparison than in the Days of our Forefathers I verily believe it is so Because the Increase of Rank Weeds is a natural Indication of Strength in the Soil that breeds them I was reading the other Day That in the Reign of King  Edward  the Second the Number of  Attorneys  was limitted  and one hundred and forty declar'd sufficient to serve the whole Kingdom  WHAT a Surplusage of rapacious Claws has this Nation then to spare if we were dis∣pos'd to cut our Nails and send the Parings to our NeighboursPut the Case Mr  PlainDealer  That yout Friend the  Czar of Russia  were to borrow thirty or forty thousand of our  Inns o'Court Labourers  to help his own clumsy Subjects in Digging that Canal for joining the two great Rivers you were mentioning I can but smile to think how happy they wou'd make himLet his Rivers be never so distant they will bring 'em together by the Ears and work away every Inch of the firm Ground between themYou can't think what an admirable Talent they have at your  Dirty Work  for whereever they find a Hole they never leave it 'till it is past stoppingSo pray use your Interest to procure a Transportation in that Monarch's Favour  of these  RootandBranch Pioneers  for 'tis Pity so great a Prince shou'd want an As∣sistance that we cou'd lend him without do∣ing ourselves the least Hurt by it I am  Yours as far as is left of me  GOOSE FEATHERLESS  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Notus in fratres animi paterni  HOR  FRIDAY  July    I NEVER wak'd in more Harmony and Composure of Mind than I did Yesterday Morning when rising chearfully with my Spirits more diffused than ordinary I visited my Friend the  Major  whose Face as often as I see it makes me happier than I was be∣fore From his firm and steady Temper I learn to break the Force of my Disappoint∣ments by the Patience with which I receive them And I am taught by his Generosity to feel the Weight of no Misfortunes but those which oppress my Friends whom I love without being able to comfortWhen I see this Gentleman despising and even adorning  himself by his Afflictions I am ashamed to have ever murmured or considered my own as burthensome  I FOUND this faithful Friend reading one of my printed Papers and entertaining his lit∣tle Family with all the Chearfulness of the FortunateHe rose and received me smiling I have been Reasoning away some Pain said he by the Influence of your PLAIN DEALER How powerful are your Thoughts And how happy am I in your Friendship What a Force of Delight comes with the Praise of those we love It is Musick to the Mind and our Cares dissolve before it  THE generous Fulness of his Heart was prepared to say much more if I had not in∣terrupted him by proposing a Walk into the FieldsIt was one of those sweet sunless Days when though no Place was shelter'd yet every Place would be shady We had wander'd without designing it 'till we found ourselves by  ChelseaCollege  The Grandeur Use and Beauty of that Building charm'd us into a short Silence which the  Major  broke agreeably by these apt and just Reflections  THOUGH  Charity  is last in Rank when we name the three great Virtues it stands first methinks in Dignity for it seems to include the others There may be  Faith  and  Hope  where there is no  Charity  but there can be no  Charity  without  both  It imploys  Faith  in the easy Credit which it allows to affirm'd and rational Appearances And it applies  Hope  to its own and others Benefit by in∣dulging an Expectation that all that is amiss will mend and Ills produce good Consequen∣ces The common Notion of this Virtue centers in a contracted Beneficence toward the Support of the Poor and Needy And that too for the most Part when the Bestower has no longer the Power of enjoying what he parts with Whereas  Charity  in its noblest Sense requires a Return of  good Offices  to the very Malice that oppresses us For it teaches us not only to  act well  but also to  think generous∣ly  It banishes from the human Soul all its sordid Affections All Partiality to our own Interests All Attachment to our own Opinions All Jealousies and low Suspicions concerning the Designs Words and Actions of those we hear of or converse with It is in short the great Refiner and Ennobler of the Mind It swells the Heart with Pity Friendship Justice Pardon Openness and Magnanimity And stifles the inward Strug∣lings of Selfpreference Revenge Distrust Pride Avarice and Ignorance  THOUGH it is certain answered I That  Charity  at full Extent is no less than you describe her yet even in the Sense most li∣mitted her Influence is sweet and amiable How wretched would many Thousands be through want of the most common Comforts if Ostentation did not borrow the white Robe of Charity to disguise her Pride of Heart in the Appearance of Humility And if the  Miser on the Brink of Life did not fill his trembling Hands with Benefits that bless the Destitute as effectually as if his Will and not his Penitence had urged him to bestow them  HOW many want the Pity which even an Hospital can give them How many return hungry cold weary disappointed and de∣spairing to their famish'd and unfriended Children What double Death would it be to an unhoping wanting Husband to see the Breast of a lov'd Wife dry'd up with killing Want and a dying Infant held in vain to her insensible exhausted BosomI know you feel not that you can be miserable 'till you think of the  more miserable  And I should not therefore haunt so apprehensive a Re∣flection with Apparitions of imagined Sorrow But how frequent would such Lots become if not prevented by the  late  indeed yet al∣ways  welcome  Bounty of those Founders even of our common Houses of Compassion Our Monuments of DeathBed Bribery to which for the Example's sake  This  World allows the Name of Charity  IT has been remarked but I hope it was unjustly That the Charity of Women is much narrower than that of MenIf this is true it is an Accident which must be owing to some Error in their Education for Nature meant it otherwise and soften'd their tender Minds to fit them for Impressions of a mild and pity∣ing QualityIn all the Sculptures and fine Paintings of Antiquity we see Charity repre∣sented  as a smiling  Woman  to shew it is the  Sex's Virtue  and that Sweetness Grace and Bounty should adorn a Lady's LovelinessWhen I see a Woman fortunate yet narrowminded and unmerciful I look with Scorn upon her Beauty and think most upon the Dross it covers I grow angry at beholding such a gay and gilded Sepulchre and turn my Eyes from her shining Dust to the more grate∣ful Earth which it was taken from  HOW different replied the  Major  from such a Woman as you are describing is the charming  Belvidera  I have seen her lovely Features which give new Joy to the  Trium∣phant  languish and look comfortless when she has heard of the  Unhappy  Her Voice which wakes the Soul and calls it up into the Ear with all the Musick of a Trumpet falls and trembles when she talks of Wretchedness which she is sensible she cannot remedy The Numbers whom she obliges have two Rival Benefactors which divide and perplex their Gratitude for they know not which most merits it her  Manner  or her  Bounty  To such a sweet Excess of Tenderness does  Belvi∣dera  raise her Charity that she would be old unseen unlovely rather than adorable as she now is because she  pains  where she must  on∣ly pity  She is at once the most charming and least conscious of all Women  WHILE we were speaking of her we were surprized in the most agreeable Manner pos∣sible by the Sight of her Chariot passing us  She bowed very humbly and order'd it to stop and while her Servants retir'd with a Politeness and Sensibility which I have very seldom remark'd in Persons of their low Con∣dition she receiv'd us with an Air of Sweetness that resembled the Idea which we have of a descending AngelShe lamented that she was in her Chariot because her Coach she said might have held us all she wou'd there∣fore  leave  it to bless our Walk The Major offer'd her his Arm at which I felt a kind of foolish Envy which I knew not how to re∣concile with my growing Passion for  Patty Amble  HOW attractive is Beauty when it is sof∣ten'd by the humblest Modesty and yet dig∣nify'd by Wit and MajestyShe busied and delighted my Soul and I was so trans∣ported by her Voice and Sentiments that I fell in Love with my own Silence because it pro∣long'd the Pleasure of her Speaking  WE were join'd in this Place very unex∣pectedly by  Ned Volatile  who had enquir'd for us at the  Major  's and rambled hither in pursuit of us He had never seen  Belvidera  nor so much as knew who she was yet came up with his usual Air of brisk Assurance and Sufficiency  What  cry'd he  my Old Friends engag'd in a Confederacy against my Li∣berty  Then he retreated with a kind of counterfeit Astonishment and lowering his Voice went on thus looking with a genteel Levity upon the Lady  I don't know Ma∣dam  what undeserv'd good Opinion you may have of these grave Gentlemen but I shall never be brought to think patiently of 'em again'Twas ungenerous and unpardonable to give a poor Wretch no Warning but draw him in with an unguarded Breast to stand the Mark of all these Charms where it is impossible but I must fall by some of 'em  Believe me Sir  reply'd  Belvidera  with a Mixture of Disdain and Compassion  The Danger you complain of is too small to excuse your TerrorHowever open your Heart may lie few first Blows reach thitherIf you are wounded at Sight the Hurt was only in your Eyes and the Armour you should have been defended by was not a BreastPlate but a HeadPiece  I SHALL never forget with what an Air of Surprize and Awe poor  Ned Volatile  start∣ed back at the piercing Voice of  Belvidera  and from the smiling Sharpness of her Satire But I love the young Rogue's Virtue and I own my Heart triumph'd for him under the Mortification of this Retreat for it sate on him methought more gracefully than all his natural Gayety  HE kept behind us all the Way in a sin∣cere and becoming Confusion listning atten∣tively to  Belvidera  without one Attempt to Rally But I observ'd him at length draw out his PocketBook with a Sigh in which he writ for Three or Four Minutes and then giving it into my Hands I found he had been  penning down his  Dying Speech  with a woful Warning to all Christian People to take Ex∣ample by his Suffering  Let rash young Fools for what I now endure  Learn never to believe their Hearts secure  Once O ye Gay a striking Hour may come  When Mirth shall cease to smile and Wit grow dumb  The light low Jest the giddy Repartee  The chearful Triflings of the Vain and Free  When  Love's  warm Hand shall wake the wond'ring Heart  Will shame the Mem'ry and increase the Smart  Oh  Love  from Midnight Mirth Wit Friends and Wine  Take my snatch'd Soul from this soft Moment Thine  I COU'D not resist the Temptation I was under to make Atonement for  Ned  's Imper∣tinence by presenting his Poetick Penitence to the Divine  Belvidera  She perus'd it with a conscious Blush and an Air of eloquent Dis∣order which has given a reviving Hope to the Distress of her new Lover But it robb'd us too soon of her Company for she took Leave presently after and permitting her Hand to  Ned Volatile  stept again into her Chariot and left us melancholy and dissa∣tisfy'd  THE Major and I were for returning to our first Subject and had resum'd the Dis∣course of Charity but  Ned  would have no∣thing but Love His whole Soul was fill'd  with the Image of  Belvidera  And a Passion which 'till now he cou'd never mention se∣riously was become on a sudden the darling Theme of his ConversationGroves Brooks and  Belvidera  were the Objects of his ena∣mour'd FancySilence Thought Shade Solitude Things which he had never before a Notion of presented themselves to his Ima∣gination as the most desirable Delights of Na∣tureThe Major oblig'd him beyond Ac∣knowledgment and won all that remain'd of his Heart by talking to him of a Poem which he cou'd shew him when he came Home call'd  The Picture of Love  and repeating out of it some Lines the most adapted to  Ned  's new Circumstances  Cautious ye Fated who frequent the Fair  Your Breasts examine nor too rashly  dare  Curb your untrusted Hearts while yet they're free  Love is resistless when you  feel  'tis  He  Small is the Soul's first Wound from Beauty's Dart  And scarce th' unheeded Fever warms the Heart  Long we mistake it under  Liking  's Name  A  soft Indulgence  that deserves no Blame  A Pleasure we but take to do her Right  Whose Presence charms us and whose Words delight  Whose sweet Remembrance broods upon the Breast  And whose dear Friendship is with Pride possess'd  Excited thus the smother'd Fire at length  Bursts into Blaze and burns with open Strength  This Image which before but sooth'd the Mind  Now  lords  it there and rages unconfin'd  Mixing with all our Thoughts it wastes the Day  And when Night comes it dreams the Soul away  Pungent Impatience tingles in each Vein  And the Sick Bosom throbs with aking Pain  Ned  was impatient to learn more of a Lesson which he found so fit for him But the  Major  with much Difficulty came off by assuring him that though he could remem∣ber no more at present yet he had it at Home in Manuscript and would shew it him all an∣other TimeHe then grew quiet and walk'd on contentedly 'till the full Advance of the Day put us in mind that if we return'd we might perhaps find Dinner waiting for us  THE PLAIN DEALER

Officers and universally be∣loved by his Soldiers In those Sunshine Days of his Prosperity  Belmont  held dear as his BosomIntimate a Gentleman by Name  Cel∣sus  and had one particular Servant whom  on account of many rare Qualities he loved above the rest and treated as Monsieur  Bruyere  advises and whom for the Sake of his Fide∣lity to his Master we will call  Fido  BELMONT  and  Celsus  lived indeed like true Friends And as if each thought the other's Interest his own they commutually as Exigences on either Side required furnished one another with Money and desired no In∣terest or Security At length when they had long loved and lived together  Celsus  was called to another Quarter Never did Soul and Body part with more Reluctancy than these Friends being  less  certain when and where and how they should meet again Much about the same Time  Fido  having been bred to a Trade and got a little Stock by his Master had Thoughts of setting up in the World His Master when he discharged him added to the Salary he paid him a handsome Present and wished him good Fortune with such Familiarity and Condescension as made the  Wish  more endearing than the  Present  AFTER this if we behold  Belmont  it must be under a Cloud of Evils He met with cross and severe Accidents which reduced him to narrower Circumstances than suited so liberal a Soul He who delighted in extricating others out of Troubles and Perplexities was at length involv'd in Difficulties himself In a word his Affairs were brought to that Ex∣tremity that a certain Sum must be punctually paid on such a Day or  Belmont  be exposed to  such an indecent Distress as it is painful but to think of  MANY Measures he had try'd in vain to make Provision against it He was acquaint∣ed with many Persons of Fashion who had been lavish of their Vows of Friendship and profuse even to Prodigality in offering him their Services at Times when they well knew there was no Danger in the Offer He tried them all in their Turns And found them all false alike  HOW will it go with poor  Belmont  who has the Illluck of such Acquaintance why the Reader will be pleased to hear That  Cel∣sus  is return'd to  England  as much in the Abundance as  Belmont  in the Want of all Things and settled within a Mile or two of  London  On him were  Belmont  's Eyes turn'd from the sad Scene that threaten'd him Here he is sure to be right Here his Address must prevail I fancy myself walking over the Fields with  Belmont  I hear him say he is no longer to groan under his Misfortunes than till they can reach the Ear of  Celsus  They want no∣thing towards being reliev'd but being bare∣ly laid before him Then  Belmont  is to asto∣nish him with the Falshood and Meanness of his other Acquaintance Thus soothing his Imagination he arrives at the House of  Celsus  is receiv'd with the Warmth of Friendship he opens his Complaint and tells the Story of the Usage he had met with Here the Reader will be stunn'dthe Story was as unprofita∣ble  in the Ear of  Celsus  as if their Friendship had been a Fable  AS  Belmont  was returning home cross the Fields loaded with heavy Reflections with whom should he meet but his old Man  Fido  walking out with an Intention to lie that Night at his CountryLodgings for the Benefit of the Air  Fido  would walk back part of the Way with his Master And finding him very melancholy implored him to tell the Cause of itAt length  Belmont  half smiling said Thou can'st not help me in it honest  Fido  and yet with a Sigh said he now I think on't I will tell thee for thou knowest  Celsus  Thou must remember himSir reply'd  Fido  and ever shallI can't forget your best Friend I hope he is not dead  Belmont  told him the whole Story Just as he had finish'd it they reach a little publick House on the Road  Fido  without answering begg'd him to walk in called for Pen Ink and Paper and wrote a Note for the Money and giving it his Ma∣ster said thus  I am glad at my Heart it was a Sum within my Power without breaking in upon my Stock because I should have parted with it All for Sir I owe it All to you  LET us consider  Celsus  and  Fido Celsus  a Friend and a Companion  Fido  a Menial Ser∣vant  Fido  a Weaver of fine Silks  Celsus  a Wearer of finer how then shall we reconcile this Matter That  Celsus  after all this Diffe∣rence in Substance and Figure should be on∣ly Gentleman in  Appearance Fido  in  Reality  It is easy to answer that the Stage of Life is like the Theatre where the principal Parts acted are not always the best It is not  what  Part we act but  how  we act it that gives us Applause I have frequently known a Ser∣vant the chief Ornament of a Play It is the same in the World where they often make considerable Figures  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum  VIRG  FRIDAY  July    I AM never more delighted than when I meet with an Opportunity to unveil ob∣scure Merit and produce it into Notice There being nothing that more easily deceives us than our Judgment on the Wit and Learn∣ing of a Cotemporary Writer when we take not our Measure from our own Examination but rely on the Authority of Publick Rumour  A PLEASANT Vein a busy medling Ta∣lent Acquaintance Importunity Preferment or any outward and accidental Advantage shall throw forward an assuming Trifler into Distinction and Popularity While a great  and modest Genius is neglected and unfam'd because not One in Fifty of our Men of Fa∣shion or of Quality as they call themselves has an Understanding that is able to  go alone  They are forc'd therefore to wait 'till they have their Sustainer's Opinion to lean against before they dare venture upon the Praise even of what they are inclinable to think favoura∣bly of as far as poor weak  Wards  can pre∣sume  to think at all  whose Wits are out in Guardianship and under other Mens Disposal  IT is owing to the Multiplicity of these overgrown  Infants  that our Eyes and Ears are fatigu'd by such Impertinence of mistaken  Encomium  Insomuch that to those who in∣spect the Things and Persons which are most praised among us we appear a Nation of  Grotesque Thinkers  whose Idea of our Writers Excellence like the  Dutchmens  Taste of  Paint∣ing  seems to be Nature in a Fit of Distor∣tion where  Grimace  is placed for  Dignity  BY a Custom that has prevailed too much since the chearful Times of King  Charles  the Second when they ran into the contrary  Ex∣treme  to that which they had  suffer'd by  and confounded the  Serious  with the  Humorous  treating the most solemn Subjects after a light and wanton Manner we have established a false Taste of Wit which has insensibly like an unnoted Current declin'd us from our right Course and brought us so far out of our Way that it will be some Time before we find our∣selves restored to our old RelishThe slen∣der  Shape of the Modern Muse is made for becoming the  HoopPetticoat  but there was a charming majestick  Nakedness  in that ner∣vous Simplicity and plain Soundness of  pa∣thetick Nature  which went to the  Hearts  of our Forefathers without stopping at their  Fan∣cy  or winding itself into their Understanding through a Maze of mystical Prettinesses  BUT though this venerable  undress'd Na∣ture  is seldom to be met with now and has indeed been lost among us for above a  Cen∣tury  it was so frequent Two or Three hun∣dred Years ago that their lowest Class of Poets the Composers of our good Old Ballads have left us some of the noblest Examples of the  Sub∣lime  in its most striking Energy But in the present Practice it is stifled as the  Roman  Maid was under the Oppression of Golden Ear∣rings Bracelets Jewels and heap'd Heavi∣nesses of the  Gothick Armory  Yet now and then we start upon it in the Writings of our Modern Poets as I did the other Day in an  Ode on the Power of Musick  which was writ∣ten by a young  Scots  Gentleman who has conveyed in a naked Grandeur and in the ut∣most Degree of Plainness the following awe∣ful Thought which carries a Terror that will shake the Soul of every attentive Reader  When Living Men shall die and Dead Men live  And  Order  is again to  Chaos  hurl'd  Thou  Melody  shalt still survive  And triumph o'er the  Ruins  of the  World  A dreadful Trumpet never heard before  By  Angels  never blown 'till then  Through all the  Regions  of the  Air  shall roar  That  Time  is now no more  BUT the Accident which has drawn me in∣to this Lamentation for the Loss of  Nature  in our Works of Wit and Poetry where she ought most to shew herself is my having taken up in a late Perambulation as I stood upon the Top of  PrimroseHill  a torn Leaf of one of those Halfpenny Miscellanies which are published for the Use and Pleasure of our  Nymphs of low Degree  and known by the Name of  Garlands  That Part of it which first caught my Eye had its Turn a little too  Modern  as well in the Matter as the Poetry and celebrated the Midnight Triumphs of some  straggling Female  of whom I had no Knowledge but one it should seem of more Beauty than Delicacy  Who took the Place of Ladies bright  And with their Lords lay all the Night  Who pleas'd them with her Humour free  Oh the charming  Sally Sal'sburee  BUT I pass'd lightly over this Lyrick Frag∣ment as too ludicrous for a Person of my Gra∣vity and fell unexpectedly upon a  Work  for so I make no Scruple to call it that deserves to live for Ever And which notwithstanding its Disguise of coarse brown Paper almost  unintelligible Corruptions of  Sense  from the Blunders of the Press with here and there an obsolete low Phrase which I have alter'd for the clearer Explanation of the Author's Mean∣ing is so powerfully filled throughout with that Bloodcurdling chilling Influence of Na∣ture working on our Passions which Criticks call the  Sublime  that I never met it stronger in  Homer  himself nor even in that prodigious  English  Genius who has made the  Greek  our CountrymanThe simple Title of this Piece was  WILLIAM  and  MARGARET  A BALLAD  I  WHEN Hope lay hush'd in silent Night  And Woe was wrapp'd in Sleep  In glided  Marg'ret  's paleey'd Ghost  And stood at  William  's Feet  II  Her Face was like an  April  Sky  Dimm'd by a scatt'ring Cloud  Her claycold lilly Hand Kneehigh  Held up her sable Shroud  III  So shall the fairest Face appear  When Youthful Years are flown  Such the last Robe that Kings must wear  When Death has reft their Crown  IV  Her  Bloom  was like the Morning Flow'r  That sips the Silver Dew  The Rose had budded in her Cheek  Just op'ning to the View  V  But  Love  had like the Cankerworm  Consum'd her tender Prime  The Rose of Beauty pal'd and pin'd  And dy'd before its Time  VI  Awake she cry'd Thy true Love calls  Come from her Midnight Grave  Late let thy  Pity  mourn a Wretch  Thy  Love  refus'd to save  VII  This is the dark and fearful Hour  When injur'd Ghosts complain  And Lovers Tombs give up their Dead  To haunt the faithless Swain  VIII  Bethink thee  William  af thy Fault  Thy Pledge of broken Truth  See the sad Lesson thou hast taught  My unsuspecting Youth  IX  Why did you first give Sense of Charms  Then all those Charms forsake  Why sigh'd you for my Virgin Heart  Then left it thus to break  X  Why did you  present  pledge such Vows  Yet none in  Absence  keep  Why said you that my Eyes were bright  Yet taught 'em first to weep  XI  Why did you praise my blushing Lips  Yet make their Scarlet pale  And why alas did I fond Maid  Believe  the flatt'ring Tale  XII  But now my Face no more is Fair  My Lips retain no Red  Fix'd are my Eyes in Death's still  Glare  And Love's vain Hope is fled  XIII  The hungry Worm my Partner is  This WindingSheet my Dress  A long and weary Night must pass  Ere Heaven allows Redress  XIV  But hark'tis Daythe Darkness flies  Take one long last Adieu  Come see false Man how low she lies  Who dy'd for pitying You  XV  The Birds sung out the Morning smil'd  And streak'd the Sky with Red  Pale  William  shook in ev'ry Limb  And started from his Bed  XVI  Weeping he sought the fatal Place  Where  Marg'ret  's Body lay  And stretch'd him o'er the Greengrass Turf  That veil'd her Breathless Clay  XVII  Thrice call'd unheard on  Marg'ret  's Name  And thrice he wept her Fate  Then laid his Cheek on her cold Grave  And dy'dand  lov'd too late  I AM sorry I am not able to acquaint my Reader with  his  Name to whom we owe this melancholy Piece of  finish'd Poetry  under the humble Title of a  Ballad    Such Ballads  were the reverend Fragments of disjointed  Homer  when they were sung about the Streets of the  Grecian  Cities before  Lycurgus  caused the Limbs to be assembled into Union and so piec'd redeem'd and consecrated them to the End of Time as we now see 'em in his  Iliad  Yet the Common Fate of Merit is so unequal to its Claim that one might almost venture to conclude That this  great Genius  whoever he was lived poor and died unknown in Want perhaps of Ease and Comfort while he had Excellence that merited a Nation's Gratitude for the Honour he might have lived to do it  FROM an Air of impressive Earnestness that is distinguishable through this Piece I am of Opinion that it was founded on the real  History of some unhappy Woman of the Age the Author liv'd in who had the Misfortune to die untimely by her Lover's Insensibility or rather by his IngratitudeI please my∣self with an Imagination that this  Sonnet  might be one of  Shakespear  's A hundred worse are imputed to him And there is his peculiar solemn Power to touch this  ChurchYard Ter∣ror  very visible in the  Ghost  of this Ballad  BUT whoever the Author was his Judg∣ment appears to have been as extraordinary as his Genius as is finely visible in his Conduct of this little PoemWhen the Ghost has gli∣ded in and stands at the Bed's Foot of the sleep∣ing Lover had the Speech begun immediate∣ly the Reader must have been hurried too fast away from the Impression which the Ap∣parition was design'd to make on him He is therefore judiciously detained in this Place by a Description of her Face and Posture so strongly painted that we really seem to  see  her And after a short Moral Reflection which follows aptly in the Third Stanza we are acquainted during this artful Interval with her Character her Youth her Beauty and the Cause of her unhappy Death And by that Time we are prepared to know her and to pity her the Speech is open'd with this sharp and startling Summons  Awake she cry'dThy true Love calls  Come from her Midnight Grave  BUT nothing was ever juster or more strikingly imagin'd than his Comparison of the Ghost's Face to an  April  Sky which is at best but faintly shining and is here made fainter still by a scattering Cloud that dims it to the Shadow as it were or thin Resemblance of a Light not visible This is an Image so true to the Meaning so Poetical and welladapted that it greatly deserves Notice As does also That Claycold LillyHand that holds up a  sable Shroud  The Opposition of the Shroud's Blackness to the Lilly White∣ness of the Hand is a delicate and graceful Stroke and very judiciously heighten'd by that Epithet of  Claycold  which makes us shrink as if we  felt  what we  see  so very  strongly  TO wake us from this Horror in order to make way for that  Pity  which he is prepar∣ing to move in us we are by a sudden yet almost imperceptible Transition carried away from what she  is  to what she  was  before Love chang'd her  Her  Bloom  was like the  Morning Flow'r  That  sips  the  SilverDew  I AM charm'd by a Stroke in this sweet  Simile  which is touch'd with so much Delica∣cy that it would go near to escape the Obser∣vation of any Reader not skill'd in Poetry I will therefore take Notice That her exact Time of Life being directly pointed out by  The Morning Rose just opening to the View  that Expression of  Sipping the SilverDew  is peculiarly just and elegant For where a Flower is full blown the Dewdrops have free Admission and are taken in as it were by large Draughts but a budding Flower receiving no Moisture but on its Edges is with the finest Propriety said to  sip  it  A SECOND excellent  Simile  is That where he compares a secret Love in a Woman's Heart to the Cankerworm in a Bud that fades and destroys it And this again has the Air of  Shakespear  who has the same Al∣lusion for  Grief  in one of his TragediesThere is something exquisitely  touching  in that noble Tenderness of her Reproach in the  Eighth Stanza  That  Erotema  or Figure of  Questioning  which takes up the  Ninth Tenth  and  Eleventh  is pursued with the most pathetick Emphasis and at last broken off with an  Aposiopesis  so natural and so mov∣ing that I have seldom seen a Beauty more distinguishable It is where after all those passionate  Why's  with which she has been up∣braiding her Lover's Falshood she interrupts them on a sudden with this Selfaccusing Question which strikes out the  Moral  too in a surprizing Flash of Warning where it was least to be expected  And  why alas  did I fond Maid  Believe  the flatt'ring Tale  BUT it were endless to particularize the Beauties of this charming Ballad The whole may be said to be one continued Beauty And I believe it will not be possible for any serious Reader to peruse or hear it without Emotions in his Blood that will speak more in its due Praise than the most regular  Cri∣tique  on it  IT is a plain and noble Masterpiece of the  natural  Way of Writing without Turns Points Conceits Flights Raptures or Af∣fectation of what Kind soever It shakes the Heart by the mere Effect of its own Strength and Passionateness unassisted by those flam∣ing Ornaments which as often  dazle  as  dis∣play  in Poetry This was owing to the Author's Native Force of Genius For they who conceive a Thought distinctly will of Necessity express it plainly because out of the Words which arise and offer themselves to embody a Meaning they find no Use for the Superfluous but to darken and confound their Purpose  THE PLAIN DEALER No  PROPRIA QUAEMARIBUS  LILLY's Grammar  Interea volucres Pyrois Eois Aethon  Solis Equi quartusque Phlegon hinnitibus auras

And we meet every  Monday  Night to discourse of such Things as may entertain and improve us in a way most suitable to that industrious and unambiti∣ous Honesty which Men of Trade pro∣pose to thrive by But our Diversion has been often spoil'd by a great Scholar who is got among us that makes no more of  Greek  and  Latin  than if it were only plain  English  Ever since he was introduc'd he has had all the Talk to himself but  was never understood above Three times from the first Night he came into our Com∣pany He is  Great Mogul  of our Club and reigns Absolute and without a Mini∣stry Publishing his  Edicts  in a Language peculiar to the Throne and which being unintelligible by any of his  Vassals  can neither be contradicted nor disputed against  HE expatiated last Night with a Stile unusually  florid  on the  Verbosity Loquaciousness  and  Propension to Garrulity  of a worthy CommonCouncilMan whom we were commending for a ready Speaker And when one of us by way of

dehominated  those Persons who were  obnubilated  by its  Umbrageousness  and  involv'd  their  Comprehension  in a  La∣byrinth  of  Internality  IT happen'd fortunately for the CLUB that an honest Drunken Officer belonging to the  EastIndia  Company was among us upon this OccasionHe was now what we call  Half Seas over  and star'd at our Man of Oratory for a Minute with∣out Motion At last he began to tell him with the most compos'd Face in the World That he was charm'd with this Opportu∣nity of discoursing with a Gentleman of  so much  Wit  and  Learning  and hop'd he shou'd have his Decision in a Point that was pretty nice and concern'd some  Eastern  Manufactures of  Antient  and  reverend Ety∣mology  Modern Criticks he said were undetermin'd about them but for  His  Part he had always maintain'd That  Chintz Bullbull Morees  and  Ponabaguzzys  were of nobler and more generous Use than  Doorguzees  or  Nourfurmannys  not but he held against  Byrampauts  in Favour of  Ni

than the finer Fabrick of  Blue Chelloes  THERE was not One of all the Com∣pany except the grave Banterer himself but laugh'd out aloud at this humorous Retribution of the Scholar's affected Lan∣guage He look'd a little out of Counte∣nance and sate silent for some Time But he started up at last with a smiling Air of good Humour And filling out a Brim∣mer drank the Health of the  EastIndia  Officer and then spoke to him as fol∣lows  Sir I find myself much obliged and return you my Publick Thanks You have held to me so true a Glass that I see and am ashamed of the Image of my Vanity I was weak

to these Two Letters Two uncommon Pieces of Poetry The First was written by  Karasin  the Favourite Mistress of  Tamerlane the Great  by way of Congratulation after his Success against  Bajazet  It was compos'd in Form of a  Lozange  the Letters of which were Brilliant Diamonds upon a Ground of Crimson Velvet The Words the Order and the Figure are exactly as in the Origi∣nal Note The  Wit  of

by Queen  Elizabeth  on Oc∣casion of her first Uneasiness concerning  Mary  Queen of  Scots  I met with this little Piece in an Old  Art of English Poesy  which was  Imprinted  at  London in the Year  and Dedicated to the Lord Treasurer  Burleigh  The Author speaking of these Verses says  '  And this was the Occasion of them Our Sovereign Lady perceiving how by the Queen of  Scot  's Residence within this Realm were bred secret Factions among her People some of them desirous of Innovation and aspiring to greater Fortunes by her Liberty and Life The Queen our Sovereign Lady to declare that she was nothing Ignorant of these Secret Practices albeit she had long with great Wisdom and Patience dissembled it writeth this Ditty most sweet and sententious  Watchful to shun those Snares which

enim ferme sensus communis in illa  Fortuna  Ibid  Nobilitas sola est atque unica Virtus  Ibid  FRIDAY  July    THERE is a HobbyHorse in the World call'd Nobility by Right of  Birth  which was the Invention of industri∣ous Policy to entail and perpetuate Vir∣tue But like Vinegar from the finest Wines it is so changed by its Putrefaction That there is not a sharper Curse among the Scourges of God's Vengeance than is inflicted on Mankind by that silly Thing called  Pride of Descent  It was first indulged as a Mark of Merit But it clings inseparably to the  Line  after the most manifest Extincti∣on of all the  Worth  which it was given for  YET there was both the  Rational  and the  Generous  in that Hope which seems to have been conceiv'd by the first Inventors of  Nobility  from its Original InstitutionSome Great and Powerful Prince when he had experienc'd a Servant's Courage his Con∣duct or Integrity and was willing to tran∣smit those Virtues after they had been so useful to Himself to the future Benefit of His Heirs and Successors made it his first Care to bestow on this able Favourite such Lands and Extent of Revenue as might place him above the Necessity of concerning himself for his Childrens Support in Life And this left him at perfect Leisure to en∣large and inspire their Minds till He made them capable of succeeding as well to his Toils and Dangers as to his Honours and Possessions  TO strengthen yet more their Expecta∣tion of so good an End They contriv'd this further Means of adding visible and out∣ward Marks betokening Honour Power and Wisdom Such as  Titles Robes Rank Privileges  and a Train of Pomps and Cere∣monies All These they made  Hereditary  for this weighty and sufficient ReasonBecause It was a natural Hope that Persons who were exempt from private Wants should  also be unsubject to private  Baseness  They would then be at Liberty to enlarge and exalt their Thoughts in Proportion to that High Condition which they grew up in the Expectation and Foreknowledge of 'Till they came to disdain narrow Principles and renounce selfish Purposes such as  Poverty  might have seemed to justify but which could never correspond with that Magnificence and disinterested Scope of Mind which was propos'd to be the Consequence of so distin∣guish'd an Education in a Life so happily provided for  A NOBLEMAN the Descendant of No∣ble Ancestors when we consider him in this Light seems to be One of the Pillars of Hu∣man Virtue and the honour'd Ornament of a Body Politick And the only Reason why we talk with Respect or even with Gravity of the  Antiquity  of a Man's Family is Be∣cause by how many more Successions the Line has continu'd  Noble  by so many more Examples their Virtues are suppos'd to have been fortified 'till the Practice and Love of  Glory Justice Knowledge  and  Compassion  are esteem'd inherent in their very Nature and their Blood flows down distinguish'd by a kind of  Inspiration  which it carries with it  BUT exclusive of this single Consideration what a ridiculous Pretence to  Reverence  is the Accident of having been  born to live lazily  It is Insolence in the highest Degree for  a  Cypher  of Rank and Title to expect Sub∣mission from a Person who is venerable for his good Qualities upon no better a Foun∣dation than because the  accomplish'd Commo∣ner  is perhaps the Son of an honest Man who had nothing to depend on but his In∣dustry And the  foolish Lord  had a Father who left him an Estate and a Title which somebody  a long Time ago  gave a sturdy valiant  Soldier  to maintain his Posterity till they shou'd grow  good for nothing  and look with Scorn at their first Founder Draw∣ing all their empty Glory from the number'd Ages which have passed since  Merit  and  Humility  could claim a Place in their  Great Family  IF in the World there is a pleasanter Piece of stupid Impertinence than ordinary It is that conceited and satisfied  SelfPreference  with which one of these  Happy  Creatures looks down from his own Sublimity upon the  Merit  that lies below himBut I wonder what he would Answer if in the Heighth of his Exultation  Fortune  shou'd take a Freak to whisper this Question in his Ear  "  Pray my Lord have you consider'd how to  Deserve  this fine Distinction which you in∣herit without knowing whyAre you Honester than your own Steward  Pretty much upon a  ParAre you Braver than your ragged Cousin  Oh noNot at all  Are you more Pious than your Chaplain  Far from it I assure you  Are you Wiser or more Learned than my Lady your Lordship's Wife  But a little if any thing  Are you Richer than your Banker  Not so Rich by half a Plumb  Pray what then may your Lordship's Pretensions be to that Respect which you claim from others  Whyyou know  says he  that I was  born to it  "  IT is a pleasant Pretension let us trace it a little higherWhy is  This Lord  's Family of more Dignity than  That Lord  's since their Estates and Rank are Equal  Oh there is a very good Reason for That It is because His Race is most Ancient  Pray what do you mean by  Ancient  Was not  Adam  their common Father  Yes But This MyLord has been longer in Possession of Lands than That MyLord has  So then the Case it seems stands thus  Other Mens Acquirements must give Him  DIGNITY  to whom Other Mens Merit has given  DISTINCTION  ANTIQUITY of Name and Family is one of the most riduculous Things in Nature when it is made use of as the  Ground of Ho∣nours  There being nothing more certain than that the Revolutions of Time and For∣tune have us'd all Families alike And were it possible to see backward into the Obscurity of past Ages we might pick out  Beggars  from our proudest Lines and point at  Princes  in our humblest This Nobility that consists in  Sound  is an empty and chi∣merical  Grandeur It is a mere  King of Clubs  who as the Game happens to be may run away from the  Knave  and see the single  Ace  a nobler  Card  than  His Majesty  I FANCY that if I were a  Lord  the  Tur∣key  Cock with his sweeping Wing erected Neck and Peerlike Strut within the Sphere of his  Barndoor Royalty  wou'd make me sick of my boasted  Quality  unless I had better Claim than my  Pride  to the Stateliness I was distinguish'd by  THE true Use of  Titles  is That they may serve as shining Lights to lay open and il∣lustrate the spacious Chambers of a  Mind wellfurnished  But to a close and sordid Soul they are like Torches which we carry down to illuminate a sickly Dungeon Where they expose but the more disgrace∣fully the narrow Cells bare Walls and Dirtiness  THE basest Thing in Nature is To have  Power  to do  much  Good without  Will  to do  any  How contemptible then are they who becoming insolent by Prosperity think on nothing so seldom as the Distresses of the Miserable And while they were made No∣ble for this End only to be active in good Offices live for  Pleasure  and to no better Purpose than one of their  Hounds  or their  setting Dogs  If a Nobleman who is thus declin'd from the only End of his Institution can be Author of any Good by Effect of his  Example  it must be such an  accidental and involuntary Service as was done of old to the  Philosopher  He was ask'd From whom he learnt to be so steady in Pursuits of Virtue  'I learn it  said he  from the Persons who live  most vici∣ously  For observing what makes them de∣spicable I see plainly what to  shun  And I guess by the  Reverse  what it is that I ought to  practise  The Eastern People ascribe to  Plato  several excellent Sayings which we do not find in his Works And among others they cite this following  '  Plenty  and  Want  are Two  Clouds  the fullest stor'd of any the First rains  Dul∣ness  and  Arrogance  the Second  Learning  and  Humility  For while the  Body  of the Poor is improving into  Spirit  the  Spirit  of the Rich is degenerating into  Body  '  It is a pretty Remark And every Man's Experi∣ence will enable him to justify it For how few Publick or Private Improvements have been owing to our Men of Rank And how many to the unsatisfied Application of the Unhappy who finding themselves press'd by uneasy Circumstances  whet  and  urge  their active Talents 'till Prosperity can afford them  Leisure  to be as useless as if they were  born to it  IT is plain then That a  Nobleman  who has no other Merit than his Rank gives him has no Merit at all And is just so much more despicable than a  Commoner  who is equally worthless as the Duties of his Condition are  more elevated and important And that  Respect  which is look'd for by a Lord  merely as a Lord  deserves to be number'd among those Sacrifices which we make to Custom at the Expence of our common Sense and to the Dishonour of our natural Liberty  AN Essay Writer of the last Age who had learnt from tiresome Experience That he had irrecoverably  lost  those Years which he had spent in attending the  Great  as they love to hear themselves call'd quitted the Pursuit with a manly Scorn And having ob∣serv'd for his Reader's Use That these Men make no Friendships but such as are subser∣vient either to their  Interests  or their  Plea∣sures  he closes all with this Remark  'I have so hearty a Contempt for what is commonly called  Greatness  that if I did not meet with the Word  Lord  in a Prayer I repeat daily I should never name it but with  Detestation  '  And to allow this Au∣thor but common Justice no Man is so fool∣ishly a Tyrant over his own Heart as he that humbles himself to a  Will  that is too proud to take Notice of it And waits on those from whom he can expect nothing but what he must dearly pay for in Guilt Dishonour or Mortification  I am pleas'd with a frank Correction of that peevish and humoursome Arrogance so inseparable from these proud Mens Beha∣viour as it was given by a  Syrian  Doctor  to one of the  Caliphs  of  Babylon  They were Angling upon the River  Tygris  and the  Caliph  growing impatient because he had catched nothing ordered the Physician out of his Sight for he was sure he should have no Sport in Company with one who was so  unlucky    'Nay but methinks reply'd the Doctor you accuse me a little rashly My Father was a Drawer of Water and my Mother but a Slave yet I have been Chief Favourite of many successive  Caliphs  and am Rich and Fortunate beyond my Wishes How then can such a Man as I deserve to be call'd  unlucky  But if you would be inform'd I can name a Person who may  truly  be stil'd unhappy'  The  Caliph  told him he might explain himself  'It is Sir pursued the Physician a Lord who descending lineally from Four illustrious  Caliphs  and being himself too a  Caliph  sits unmindful of his Dignity  catching Fish  like an idle Saunterer while  Ignorance  and  Rest  are spreading Nets to catch  his People  '  SINCE Honours were first bestow'd as a Reward of Mens past Virtues and for Ex∣citement of their Future it seems the justest Thing imaginable That all  Lords  who pos∣sess them fruitlesly should  forfeit  them And step down among the Herd to hide the Shame of those Defects which by Reason of their too high Situation blaze out like a Beacon to the Disturbance of a whole Coun∣try  As for the same Reason where a Nobleman is truly such his Wisdom his Courage and his Loyalty strike out their Influence in larger Circles than the Virtues of inferior Ranks can possibly be extended to  FOR my Part as it is my Purpose to speak of every Thing like a  Plain Dealer  I declare with the utmost Indifference That though no Man more sincerely reverences what a Nobleman was meant to be yet I can have no Respect at all for the  Name  where the  Thing  is wanting On the contrary it is my Opinion That every Gentleman of Spi∣rit should despise and mortify the Vanity of such a chimerical Superiority as would ad∣vance itself above  substantial Honour  by the empty Memory and  Sound  of it  THE Breath of a Sovereign may have Power to  create Titles  But it can have none to  invert Qualities  Though the Vessel is in the Potter's Hands and the Man  must  be cal∣led Noble  whom the King delighteth to Ho∣nour  yet he will never  be so  by his Patent if he was not before so in his NatureBut there is a Kind of Man who will al∣ways be found Noble without Aid of Pomp or Titles And in what Place soever you chance to meet him you may know him by the following Marks He will be Humble in Greatness and Immoveable in Adversi∣ty He will be compassionate without Weakness Brave without Arrogance Con∣scious without Pride and Sincere without  Indecency He will be Wary but not Sus∣picious And his Anger will have no Malice He will Love without Folly and Disap∣prove without Hatred His Hope will be Strong but Patient his Fear Awake but Easy He will be Active without Hurry and at Leisure without Idleness And at least if he be not Learned he will be a Lo∣ver of Learning  THE PLAIN DEALER N  Turpi Secernis Honestum  HOR  Nec duo sunt sed forma duplex nec foemina dici  Nec

which are grown to an enor∣mous Height in too many of both Sexes they shall furnish the Entertainment of the Day  These Female Correspondents who are such powerful and ingenious Advocates in the Be∣half of Beauty Innocence and Modesty will probably observe with Pleasure that their Letters in a short Time will have had a good Effect upon those who are not lost to all Sense of Shame they will then enjoy the Satisfaction of having efficaciously corrected with their own pretty Hands the Rude∣nesses and Abuses which they so justly com∣plain of  Epsom  July    Mr  PLAINDEALER  I HAVE had the Misfortune to be Edu∣cated after the oldfashion'd Method of our Ancestors who were so ignorant to in∣stil  Modesty  as a Virtue into their Female Pupils Now you must know Sir this Place is filled at present with a polite Set of Ladies Members of a Society with so hard a Name that I am afraid I shou'd spell it wrong so will omit it that have Heroically resolv'd to put all Modest Virgins out of Countenance by staring unmerci∣fully in their Faces This Behaviour adds so many new Charms and renders them so agreeable to all they converse with that I would gladly assume a little of this  Modern  Accomplishment But the Prejudice of early imbib'd Principles is so strong that instead of answering a SMART in his own Way I cannot forbear Blushing both for  Him and the Ladies that are diverted with his  prodigious Wit  So beg you will either assist me to conquer these  illbred Flushes  or prevail with the Ladies to  confess  their  Sex  by a Grain or two of Modesty out of Compassion to several

the  Bolds  and  Bashfuls  SIR  MOST of our Neighbours know∣ing that I have the Honour to be related to you have put me upon writing this Letter to acquaint you That Yester∣day a strange and surprizing Creature was seen to pass through our Town on Horse∣back It had the Face of a young Woman stuck full of Patches a Perriwig which hung down to Its Waist a Hat cock'd with the Smartness of a young Officer a huge Bunch of Ribbons fastened behind Its LeftShoulder a Shirt laid in large  Pleights on the Breast and tied close at the Neck and Wrists which with a Vest of White Satten trimm'd with Black had much the Resemblance of a Shroud Our whole Town was soon alarmed with this strange Appearance and various are still the Opinions what It really was The Old Peo∣ple who were the most couragious generally went pretty near to It with their Specta∣cles on to view It more distinctly the younger Sort kept It at an awful Distance Some were of Opinion that It was a High∣wayman in Disguise and accordingly were for seizing It others took It for a Nun but by a certain arch Lear It had with Its Eyes I dare engage It had not a Bit of Nun's Flesh about It However by its pale Complexion and Shroudlike Dress most of my Neighbours at last concluded It to be a Ghost and so took to their Heels and left me who am no great Believer in these Things almost alone with It in the Road I had now an Opportunity during the Time It was drinking a Glass of  Rhe∣nish Wine  and  Sugar  at the  Saracen'sheadInn  to survey It well and thereupon con∣cluding It to be an  Hermaphrodite  I enqui∣red of the Man who seemed to have the keeping of It If he intended to shew It in our Town and at what Inn for you must know Sir that I have a mighty Cu∣riosity to see one of those Creatures all over But the Man with an angry Coun∣tenance  told me That what I took for an  Hermaphrodite  was only a young Lady and that the Sort of Dress she was in was commonly worn for a  RidingHabit  by the Ladies of Fashion at  London  But as nei∣ther I nor my Neighbours can believe it possible for Folks upon no ill Design to disguise themselves in such a Manner I desire you will in one of your PLAINDEALERS for we have it constantly brought to us by our Coach inform us of the Truth which will tend very much to the Satisfaction of the best Part of our Town who are your Readers and parti∣cularly  Honoured SIR  Your Kinswoman And most Humble Servant  DOROTHY PLAIN  Kettering  in  Northampton∣shire  July    PS SIR  Since I writ my Letter some of my Neighbours tell me they believe the Creature I have writ to you about is one of the  Masqueraders  we have heard of that are common with you at  London  but for my Part I can't think it ugly enough for one of them neither  THE subsequent Epistle is very curious and gives an Account of a new Method of Scandal which my Correspondent assures me takes very much with the Satyrical Part of her Sex whom I am sorry to see so uncha∣ritable to each other and indiscreet enough to trust their Reputation to the Tongue of so loquacious an Animal  SIR  I WAS prevailed upon one Day last Week to visit my Lady  Tattle  where I was no sooner seated but I heard a Voice which I thought too hoarse to come from our Sex cry '  'Tis true she is very pretty but she has Mrs  Frail  's Fault that loves Fellows Company  And then a little after∣wards  Good Lord What's become of Miss  Patty  will she never leave the Country People say before she went she was fat about the Waist  Hearing my best Friends scan∣dalized after this rude Manner I could contain no longer but turning about to see the Author of such injurious Expressi∣ons I was surprized to hear the same Voice in the most humble Tone imaginable cry  Poor  Poll  scratch Pole pretty  Parrot It is impossible to describe the Pleasure that appear'd in Lady  Tattle  's Eyes upon hear∣ing her Bird's Discourse She told me She had bespoke Three more and that she de∣signed one for  Party  another for  Scandal  and the Third which she would instruct  herself should speak  Poetry  I beg Sir you would either in your Writings put a Stop to this growing Folly or desire some Member of Parliament to propose an Act to prohibit the Importation of  Parrots  I am  SIR  Your most Humble Servant  VINDEMIA  Kensington  July    THE PLAIN DEALER No  Omnia vincit amor noscedamus amori  VIRG  FRIDAY  August    To the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  THE few Lines I sent to you on the th of the last Month were in∣tended for the Diversion of your Readers and were the Dictates of a Mind at Ease I write to you now with a quite different'  Spirit and on a more substantial and solid Motive My Heart was then so light that I little thought it would in so short a Time grow so heavy as I now find it I am in Pain about a very worthy Relation of ours young Mr  Truelove  who being just return'd from his Travels is married to a young Lady upon whom he had secretly set his Heart for some Years before he went Abroad The Perplexity of the Case is That he has married her without the Knowledge of his Father and that the good old Gentleman without the Know∣ledge of his Son had provided for him a Lady Beautiful like her himself has cho∣sen and young like her Equal in Fa∣mily but vastly Superior in Point of For∣tune Never was there a more Paternal Affection than my Uncle  Truelove  has shewn innumerable Marks of to his Son nor were there ever more Tokens of Filial Piety than my Cousin has taken all Oc∣casions to demonstrate towards his Father It would be a wonderous Pity that any Misunderstanding should happen between so loving and beloved a Father and so lov∣ing and beloved a Son And yet we are all in mighty Apprehensions that this Marri∣age may occasion a fatal Breach between them The Father placed the Prospect of the Son's Happiness in his having a Wife with a plentiful Fortune The Son thought that with Regard to his own Happiness  no Fortune could be put in Competition with the Value of the Woman whose Virtue Beauty and Innocence had en∣dear'd her to his Heart The Father if all our Family guesses right and much I fear we do will be inraged at the Loss of an Estate in which he had imaginarily pla∣ced the whole Sum of his Son's Felicity in this World he will tax him of Impru∣dence tell him he has thrown himself away and call this Marriage so enter'd upon with∣out his Knowledge or Consent an Act of Disobedience My Cousin who bears a tender and an affectionate Heart will ill brook these Rebukes that make his Fa∣ther seem to undervalue the precious Crea∣ture whom he above all the World holds dear he will not he cannot suffer them He will justify his Choice He will be warm in the Defence of the Fair One his Father has despised He will speak with Indifference of the Fortune his Father had with Pains been seeking in Compari∣son of her and maintain the Privilege of his being of Age and free to chuse for himself Thus their very Affections by this different Notion they have of Hap∣piness may be the Causes of their Diffe∣rence and since those who have a Vio∣lence in the Passion of Love carry with them that Violence into other Passions we are apt to fear that unless some Precauti∣ons be taken the Rupture may be dange∣rous  and we rather think by gentle Me∣thods to break the Force of the Disap∣pointment in the Manner of discovering the Marriage to the Old Gentleman than leave him to the Chance of a hasty Fury upon his suddenly discovering it himself We are all on the Son's Side before the Matter breaks out and we have a Mind to make it up with the Old Gentleman as it were without his own Knowledge Our Contrivance is what I am sure your Hu∣manity will prompt you to help forward that you should pen a Paper in Defence of the Right which young Men have of chusing for themselves and against the Hardship there would be in a Father's interposing his Au∣thority against the Inclinations of his Son in the Case of Marriage and after we have read that to him we will open it by De∣grees Though it is more particularly ours at present yet it is the World's Concern The Young of both Sexes will be pleased with the Speculation and it may be very extensively beneficial If that Fatherly Gentleman that wise Companion of yours the Major joins with you in supporting the Cause of the young People two such Au∣thorities will be of great Weight with the old Ones and at least reconcile them so far to this general Opinion of all Children that when such Accidents happen they will not stand in need of so many Argu∣ments to reconcile them to their Persons  In complying with this you will give great Ease and Satisfaction to our whole Family and particularly to  Honoured SIR  Your Affectionate Kinswoman and Humble Servant  DOROTHY PLAIN  Kettering  in  Nor∣thamptonshire  Aug    WHEN this Letter came to my Hands the Major happened to be present and as soon as I had look'd it over I told him He had a Right to read it he did so and returning it with a Smile  Your Kinswoman  said he  makes a very reasonable Request  The Old People who are generally in the Right when they differ from the Young will not be angry with us their Coaevals and Wellwishers if we should endeavour to shew that the young People are not al∣together in the Wrong in this Point  For my share I must frankly declare That when young People are at Years of Discretion before they marry the Law of Nature and Reason seems to speak them Free to chuse for themselves since they and not their Parents for no less a Term than Life are to enjoy the  Happiness  of a  Right  Choice or feel the  Smart  of a  Wrong  one  The Major and I agreed in this Sentiment and had a long Discourse upon  the Subject which when I got Home threw me into the following Reflections  OF all the Affections which move and act pleasurably upon the Frame of Human Na∣ture  Plato  reckons Love the most desirable  For He  saith this curious Philosopher  who is thoroughly affected with this Passion removes his Soul to the Place where he has settled his Affections and loses Himself to find the Object he doats upon  This pleasant Straying this delightful Wandering of the Soul from its own Mansion is a beautiful Description of the Force of Love and the Power which those who were created to charm have to transport us as it were from the Government of Ourselves into their own absolute Dominion A Passion which is of its own Nature so violent ren∣ders Men excusable in a great measure when they seem to misplace it They cannot be said to be guilty of a Fault in disobeying their Relations when they are transported beyond the Power of giving Law to themselves They are  sunk in the soft Captivity  and Cap∣tives are not free Agents Neither is it hard it should be so in Nature on the contrary as good and virtuous Women alone have the  full  Power of moving and captivating the Soul in the manner I mention it is so far from being an Evil that it is a Blessing to be highly coveted The Man who is born of a good Mother says little enough when transported by her Desert he calls Women the Ornaments of Mankind in their  Prosperity and their Supports in Adversity There is no being happy in Life without them  PLATO  in another Place has carried the Sentiment to a more agreeable Height he says  The Soul of a Man in Love dieth in his own Body and liveth in anothers  This is Energy of Expression and yet there is not more of Strength and Delicacy than of Pro∣priety and Justness For the Soul of a Man in Love is dead to all other Appetites The Man who was in Love with Riches and ea∣ger in the Pursuit of Honour before he be∣held the Fair One who captivated his Soul the Moment his Heart confesses itself a Victim to the Enchantment of Beauty looks no longer upon Honour and Riches as the Two principal Movements they grow only secondary Bless∣ings and are no farther valued than as they may help him to comfort and adorn the adored Companion of his Life Love is really witn regard to other Affections what the Philoso∣pher's Stone is pretended to be with regard to Metals It inriches and ennobles every Thing it touches It is the genuine Elixir that gives a golden Tincture to every Dispo∣sition of the Mind it heightens Ambition it inlarges Generosity it quickens Joy it banishes Envy it extinguishes Lust it en∣livens the Virtues and extirpates the Vices of Men in all Ranks and Conditions of Life Is there a King who is a Lover of Money The Beauty whom he languishes to make a  Queen is valued beyond all his Treasure Is there a Courtier that is warm in the Pursuit of a Coronet Let him be in Love and his Mistress is his  Pride  Without her the Co∣ronet will not hinder his Head from aching A  Garter  will less assuage the Swellings of his proud Heart than a  Favour  of her be∣stowing A Man that has a Fulness of Joy in his Composition will grow melancholy if he loses the fair Object of his Desires Musick cannot please where her Voice is not heard Equipage Embroideries and Brocades are false Colours upon the Heart that is inwardly in Mourning The Envious Man envies no Body but his Rival while he continues a Lover The Lustful forgets his Appetites after Va∣riety of Women What Parent can ratio∣nally expect to be heard when he undertakes to plead against such powerful Impressions All the Urgings of Duty will be of no Effect all the Arguments that can be used will be no Arguments to these all the World beside his Mistress is nothing to the Man that is in Love and She is all the World to him  WHAT can they hope to propose to a Son in this Condition thar will deter him from his Purposes Will they propose to him a Women whom they think more beautiful and agreeable and that as an infinite Superiority of Fortune above the Fair One that is his own Choice Let her be as great a Fortune as she pleases she is no Fortune at all to him She would be with all her Wealth the Load  and Calamity of his Life  Love  he would say  is built upon the Union of Minds Hearts are not to be bribed by Gold and true Passion is not to be bought off by the Treasure of both  Indies He can have no Relish in Possessions that his desired Partner shares not Will they add That besides Fortune the Mistress they recommend has infinitely more of Beauty in the World's Eyes He will answer The World's Eye is none of his he will grant even that she may have Defects and will not stop to say  That he is even in Love with those Defects  In fine All they can propose will never avail nor is it indeed reasonable that it should If they threaten him with their Displeasure and tax him with want of Duty he will tell them That he is dutiful in all other Points he will be sor∣ry for their Displeasure but cannot obey in this One Case he will make this undeniable Quotation in his Defence That  he is to leave his Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife  And truly if his Parents think that he sins against Prudence in chusing a slender Fortune all the World will judge that they would sin against Justice if forcing his In∣clinations they make him Wretched under Pretence of making him Rich and render him Miserable under the Colour of making him Fortunate  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Principiis Obsta  OVID  Vellent tibi barbam  Lascivi pueri  HOR  MONDAY  August    THE Complaint of  CHLOE  in the ensuing Letter seems to be formed up∣on so laudable a Desire of making her Hus∣band more agreeable to her that without being entirely uncomplaisant and void of all Gallantry whatsoever there is no such Thing as refusing to insert it or denying her all the Assistance that such a Plain Old Man as I am shall be able to give her to∣wards procuring her a proper Redress from her HusbandIt is indeed a nice and ticklish Matter to have any Thing to do be∣tween married Folks and unless I had great Hopes of doing good I should have little Inclination to meddle in it  BUT I remember to have heard a particu∣lar Case once when a very Reverend Divine was applied to by both Parties to accom∣modate a Difference between them the holy Man excused himself with a venerable Shrug saying  That he had laid it down as a Maxim Never to go between a Man and his Wife on any Consideration whatever  A Friend of mine who knew both the Man and the Wife assured me That the first Grounds of their Difference were too ridicu∣lous to bear being told but that both being very stiff and obstinate not to yield an Inch on either Side were however inwardly ashamed and wanted nothing more earnestly than a Pretence to come together by the In∣terposition of the Divine If the  Doctor  had only used  Will Weathercock's  healing Method and said no more but that  Tho' both of them had been in the Wrong yet both of them were in the Right too  all would certainly have come right and they have been as good Friends as ever  FOR this Reason therefore I shall never think it a Matter of Scruple to thrust in be∣tween a discontented Couple My Corre∣spondent  CHLOE  complains of a very ob∣vious and visible Obstruction that is easy and will be even  refreshing  to her Husband to  take off  and I comply with her Desire of inserting the Complaint because I confide that her Husband's Compliance with the Prayer of her Petition will be the Conse∣quence of mine  Mr PLAIN DEALER  THIS very Day makes it exactly Half a Year since I became a Wife My Husband when he made his Applications to me always appeared Gay Genteel and Debonnair But about Two Months af∣ter we had tyed the  Gordian  Knot He be∣gan to dress in a more negligent Manner He now appears so much the Reverse of what he did formerly in Point of Dress that the Neighbours look upon it as a bad Compliment to his YokeMate Before Matrimony his Chin was scarce shaded But now the  Barber  is never sent for but on a  Saturday  Night This strange  Meta∣morphosis  you may naturally suppose is no ways agreeable to me I assure you Sir I have spared no Pains to prevail with my Deary to make his Appearance in a Man∣ner suitable to his Station However my repeated Petitions have all of them prov∣ed ineffectual I therefore beg of you Mr PLAIN DEALER to give me your Assistance in this Affair and you will high∣ly oblige  Your very Humble Servant  CHLOE  IF the Maxim of the abovementioned Divine was to be followed in our present Case  I do not know where this Complaint might end and whether it would not come to an open Rupture It is certain the most remarkable Divorces have arisen from as small Beginnings The very Letter of this young Lady shews her to be a neat and cleanly Person and therefore her Complaint of this I cannot help terming it  dirty  Usage carries the greater Weight with it I can methinks behold this young Sloven approaching the tender Thing and embracing her in a man∣ner that turns Pleasure into a Torment I see him hold her struggling against a Kiss his Arms round her unwilling Neck force her Face to his dreaded Lip he is put to the Necessity of  ravishing  a Kiss from his own Wife and yet is ignorant of the MeaningHe takes it however by ViolenceShe looks half pleased half angry hangs down her Head hides the Water in her Eyes pushes him between Jest and Earnest from her Bosom rubs her glowing and smarting Mouth calls him  Rough Thing  with half a tenderlaughing and a halfwhining VoiceThe unpolish'd Creature casts a Booby Stare at her and is stupidly at a Loss to know why she struggles so hard against what she likes Unless he is told pointblank That his Beard is the Cause of all the Disor∣der he cannot perceive that her Cheeks look red and angry with his Kisses and wear ra∣ther the Print of Fury than Love He must be told That a delicate Skin was never  form'd to be brush'd over by a bristly Beard that is rough and stubborn like the Hu∣mour that lets it grow I call it more parti∣cularly  stubborn  in this unaccountable young Fellow for she has told and told him of it again and again in plain Terms and he notwithstanding all this pertinaciously conti∣nues to go  rough  Now is it not a preposte∣rous way of acting after all that when a  Lover  he should shave close for fear of of∣fending the Eye of a Mistress whom he was uncertain of obtaining and yet let it grow when a  Husband  without having the Fear of wounded Beauty before his Eyes and without any Apprehensions of hurting that Face by his Roughness that charm'd him by its Softness  I DWELL the more upon this Subject as in∣considerable as it may seem to some because it is a Male Vice that I have frequently ta∣ken Notice of and as often wish'd to see re∣medied for the sake of the fair Sufferers who are wedded to such unpolish'd Barbarians A Marriage Conversation ought to humanize and temper Men on the contrary these in∣stead of growing tamer are made more sa∣vage by Matrimony  YOU shall see a Lover in a fine Campaign Peruque and an embroider'd Suit of Cloaths alter'd into a Husband with an aukward Country Bob and a Surtout made out of a Rug You shall find his Manners following his Dress and his Complaisance degenerating  into Bluntness It is in all Degrees alike You shall see one whom before Marriage you would take for a Lord alter'd after it into a Coachman many that seemed Senators transmuted into Jockies a hundred ceremo∣nious Beaus turn'd Clowns and numberless Sir  Clements  transformed into Country  Lob∣bins  SURE as old as I am I have a more amorous Nature in me still than these my∣sterious young Fellows whose Affections and Actions are so different I cannot tell what to make of them I can easily guess it would tickle my Ear strangely to hear a young beautiful Creature telling me how I should become more agreeable to her by adorning myself and intreating me to do it For Ex∣ample if  Patty Amble  and I were upon ab∣solute Terms of Agreement There are not any little Customs that I would not depart from for her Ease As fix'd an Aversion as I have profess'd against clouded Canes I should however be easily perswaded to carry a painted Stick instead of an Oaken if by  walking  with it I was sure to make  Progres∣sion  in my Wife's Affection nay I would admit a  Knot of Ribbons  to it into the Bar∣gain provided it would render our  MarriageKnot  the easier Again I have known Wo∣men who have a prodigious Aversion to a  Mouse  and are not only very wary at guard∣ing their Petticoats upon the Approach of that little noxious and nimble Animal but  do not even care that any Thing which looks the least like it should come near them Now if my  Patty  was of that Temper I who know how far Women are apt to stretch some Antipathies would alter the very Colour of my Gloves for fear of Offence and though I have affected  Mousecolour  for so many Years I would fit myself with a Pair of White or at least of a less frightful Complexion before I would come within Arm's Length of her Hoop In fine tho' I wear a little  Mustache  the Fashion when I was young and a Peculiarity I have not mentioned of myself 'till this Day that would rather tickle than offend yet sooner than that should interpose it should be de∣voted to the Edge of the Razor For I am absolutely for rescinding the least Obstacles between a Man and his Wife before Mat∣ters are carried too far  A GREAT many People will object that these are Trifles but I say They are Mat∣ters that have more Consequences than they dream of However granting the Objection true if conforming one'sself in little Mat∣ters is sufficient to please it is the least a Man can do to indulge so amiable a Crea∣ture  COMPLIANCE in Dress is a Piece of Matrimonial Wisdom  Fine Feathers making fine Birds  Women often chuse more judici∣ously than the Men and have Regard to  Sense Temper and Behaviour but they will have a Mixture of Appearance too in the Composition of their Man if possible and Dress passes with some of them even beyond Looks insomuch that though Fi∣nery in the general Rule be the Glory and darling Passion of a Woman yet there are Exceptions of many who would rather see their Husbands fine than themselves No∣thing is more common than to hear  ordinary  Women especially who after they are mar∣ried are very free in declaring the Source of their Affections say That the Neatness of her Husband the Smugness of his Look and the Cleverness of his Shape  c  first made her in Love with him If this be the Case when the Cause ceases the Effect will cease too The Moment he grows dirty wears a long Beard or drowns himself in a large  Josephus  the pleasant Picture that his Wife had painted of him in her Fancy va∣nishes and if not reimprinted sometimes her Liking insensibly wears away In fine as much Trifles as these are a Wife's Heart if  that  be a Trifle is lost by the Disuse of them and perhaps made a  trifling  Present of to a Stranger that minds Dressing  I HAVE been credibly informed That it is a political Piece of Cunning among those unlucky Sparks who affect to shine by the Means of modish Wickedness to observe how the Husband who grows careless after Marriage appeared in the Times of his  Courtship and to equip themselves accord∣ingly They Play the Part of the  Suiter  so well upon the  Husband  as to estrange from him the Affections of his Spouse and transfer them to their proper Purpose They dress in the same Manner wear Cloaths of the same Colour are punctual in his very Pinch and Cock of the Hat mimick his Air Gait Mien and by this Policy in Love make the Husband his own Rival But as the Face is the Mart of Love so these Inconveniencies happen mostly from an Overneglect of that Part the being not shaved ruffles a Wo∣man's Temper against her Husband while the Gallant by being trimm'd smooths a Passage to her Inclination  I AM sure if the Case stands thus a Bar∣ber is an Artisan of Importance since be∣sides taking off the  Beard  he lops away such growing Evils  LET Him therefore that values his Head look to his Beard and be mindful  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Cinis Manes Fabula fies  PERS  FRIDAY  August    EVER since I was a SchoolBoy I have been fond of walking in  WestminsterAbbey  where when my Heart is heated by the Violence of some unruly Passion I enjoy a cool Composure and a kind of Venerable RefreshmentIts dusky Cloisters majest∣ick Isles Quire Organs Royal Tombs and reverend Variety of strong impressive Images have a neverfailing Power to  reduce  my Mind from Transport when Hope Prosperity or Pleasure have betray'd it into Vanity or to  relieve  it when disorder'd by a Weight of Anguish or Oppression  DEATH and the Sun  says a  French  Writer  are Two Things not to be look'd upon with a steady Eye  Though there is something in his Observation rather pretty than just yet so far is certainly true That we are un∣qualify'd  to think serenely on our  Dissolu∣tion  while we are surrounded by the Noise and Hurry of the World in its ambitious Scenes or soften'd into sensual Wishes by the Languor of an idle SolitudeWhile  we  are Part of our own Prospect we can never view it justly But in such a Situation as the  Abbey  we are plac'd as it were out of our∣selves and from this ancient  Stand  of Death look back upon a Country which we seem no longer to have any Concern in and which therefore we can judge of with the necessary Clearness and Impartiality  THE Mind that is stedfast enough to medi∣tate calmly on Death will be arm'd to re∣sist the Strength and the Flattery of human PassionsSuch Thoughts if they make us not  better  will at least make us  wiser  since that must moderate our Wishes which puts us out of Countenance at their Levity And who can reflect without being asham'd that while every Thing in  Life  is accidental and  Death  the only Certainty we go on to act notwithstanding as if all Things else were  in∣fallible  and Death but  accidental  I sometimes suffer myself to be shut up for Five or Six Hours among the  Tombs  where I sit down without Ceremony or Reprehen∣sion among the proudest of those Princes who were once too stately to be convers'd with but at Distance and with Fear and Re∣verenceI possess in common with the Spiders their Companions and most con∣stant  Servants who spread Network over their Trophies the unenvied Privilege of sur∣rounding those last Beds of forgotten Ma∣jestyHere I bury myself in solemn Si∣lence and imprint my Imagination with Images which awaken Thought and prepare me for HumilityThe stain'd and melancholy Light that enters faintly through the painted Windows as if it wore a decent  Mourning  to become the Scene it opens to me guides me slowly by the cloister'd Allies dusty Tombs and weeping Statues till I am lost in that still Pomp of figur'd Sorrow which on every Side incloses me  From finish'd Pray'r the Flock disperse apace  And each glad Foot forsakes the dreary Place  The hooded  Prebend  plods along before  And the last  Virger  claps the ringing Door  Then thoughtful ling'ring curious and alone  In the dark Temple when the rest are gone  No Noise invades my Ear No murm'ring Breath  Not one low  Whisper  in the  Hall  of  Death  No trampling Sound swims o'er the silent Floor  But the slow  Clock  that counts the sliding Hour  HERE indulging Contemplation I forget my Cares and Misfortunes and disencumber myself from the Forms and Embarrassments of Converse I become the Inhabitant of a quiet and unbusy World where all is serene and peaceful I am disturb'd by no Fears inflam'd by no Anger inspir'd by no Hope tormented by no Jealousy I can expect  whitout Impatience and be disappointed without Affliction The Dust which is scat∣ter'd round me and which once was Living Flesh as I am choaks the Fountains of my Pride and produces in me a Mortification that is too strong for all my Passions  I WAS present very lately when of those Monumental Historians whose Imployment it is to draw a Profit from reading Lectures on these Resting Places of our antient Princes was shewing the Tomb of  Henry the Fifth  to a Circle of Holiday StrollersAfter having inform'd the tasteless Wonderers That this was  He  who  conquer'd  France That His  Son  was  crown'd  in  Paris  That he married  the French King's Daughter  And what else he had been Able to collect from the Records of this great Prince's Reign he pointed to a Plain Wooden Wormeaten Coffin that was plac'd upon the Ground by this Tomb's Side and told them That it contain'd the Body of Queen  Catherine  the beautiful Wife of this Triumphant  Henry  Adding That for a small additional Contribution he would unlock the Coffin and let them look in upon her Corpse which lay there perfect and undecay'd though she had been dead al∣most Three hundred Years They had Curi∣osity enough to pay the Price demanded and the Proposer made good his Promise unveiling to their Sight and Touch the Reliques of that Royal Charmer  I CANNOT express the Indignation and Con∣cern which this Scene gave meHer lovely Limbs which once were thought too ten∣der for the Wind to blow upon and which were never seen without Joy Reverence and Wonder by the Conqueror of Her Father's Kingdom and the Sovereign of This in which she died  Now  lay neglected and expos'd denied even Earth to cover her and made a Spectacle for Entertainment of a Croud of common Wanderers  SUPERIOR as this Lady was in her Beauty Birth and Fortune what Praeeminence in Death have all these given her above the  Meanest  and most  Unlovely  After hav∣ing made her  Life  a changeful Course of Sor∣row and Calamity they left her destitute in  Death  without the Decency of a  Grave  to  shelter  herThere now she lies a Proof of transitory Greatness To comfort the  Wretched  with this Reflection when they look in upon her expos'd Remains that  Nature  has made no Difference between a  Royal  and a  Vulgar  Body But that taking away what was added by  Fortune  each from the Moment of Death is the other's Equal to Eternity  WHAT Rank or Condition is there among us which may not draw from this great School of Moral Reasoning some Observa∣tion for their BenefitEven the  Unwary  and  Extravagant  whose Lives are a con∣tinued Luxury and to whom the Miseries  of  Debt  appear remote and without Terror Even  They  may find a Lesson among these  Tombs  for there they may be shewn the Bodies of great Men doing Penance in their Velvet Coffins and  imprison'd after Death  to satisfy the Malice of their stubborn Creditors as if the Influence of sordid Money could extend its Cruelties beyond Life and had a Privilege to disturb by Avarice the sleeping Ashes of de∣parted Sovereigns  IS a Man insulted wrong'd betray'd Does he hate his distrusted Enemy Are his Thoughts imploy'd on Revenge And does he break his Sleep with Stratagems to avoid or retaliate the Injustice that may be done him Let him walk with me in this instruct∣ive Circle and I will shew him the Dust of a murder'd Monarch mixing quietly with  his  who murder'd himI will tread with him over Earth that is passive and ferments not though compos'd of united Atoms from the mingl'd Bodies of those Men whose bat∣tling Interests and Affections while they  liv'd  shook the Kingdom like an EarthquakeWhen the  Quarrelsome  consider  This  they ought to blush at their little Hatreds and grow asham'd to let their Souls be divided by Animosity when Death may crumple their Bodies together and incorporate them with their most malicious Enemy  THERE is no Fortune so  exalted  but it may find a  Check  in this dark Mansion Nor any Condition so  dejected  but that it may  be sure of a  Comfort  Every Stone that we look upon in this Repository of past Ages is an  Entertainment  and a  Monitor  I never leave its venerable Gloom without finding my Mind cooler and more compos'd than when I enter'dI sink deep into myself and see my Heart without Disguise in its good or evil Propensities And I ga∣ther Power from these strong Impressions to re∣sist Pleasure Pride Ambition or low Avarice And to fortify the Impulses of Humility For∣giveness Charity and the Virtues of Con∣tent and Quietude  THERE was publish'd a few Years since a Poem call'd WESTMINSTERABBEY I am sorry the Author's Name was not printed with it There is somthing highly elevated in his Genius that is sweetly serious and sublimely melancholyThe Verses insert∣ed above I am indebted for to that Poem And I shall borrow from the same Piece these following which I will take the Liberty to affirm are as fine ones as were ever writtenI ask Pardon for a Transposition and Alteration or Two which I have only made that I might have the Pleasure of collecting into one view as many of the Beauties as could possibly be drawn together in the narrow Compass of my Paper  Lead on my Muse while trembling I essay  To trace thy Footsteps through the Cloister'd Way  Throw a thick Veil around thy radiant Head  And lead me through the  Dwellings  of the  Dead  Where the still Banner faded and decay'd  Nods pendant o'er its mould'ring Master's Head  Where  Loves  transform'd to Marble Angels moan  And weeping  Cherubs  seem to sob in Stone  Seize  Time  and by the Pinions urge his Stay  Stop him a while in his  Eternal Way  Bid him recline his Scythe on each pale Tomb  And name the Tenant of the darksome Room  O Muse with Care the blended Dust explore  And reinspire and  wake  the sleeping Floor  To mount their Throne here Monarchs bend their Way  O'er Pavements where their Predecessors lay  Ye  Sons  of  Empire  who in pompous Hour  Attend to wear the cumbrous Robe of Pow'r  When ye proceed along the shouting Way  Think there's a Second Visit still to pay  And when in State on buried Kings you tread  And swelling Robes sweep o'er th' imperial Dead  While like a God your worshipp'd Eyes move round  Think then O think you walk on treach'rous Ground  Though  firm  the chequer'd Pavement seems to be  'Twill surely  open  and give Way for  Thee  While crouding Lords address their Duties near  Th' anointing  Prelate  and the kneeling  Peer  While with obsequious Diligence they bow  And spread the  careful Honours  o'er thy Brow  While the highrais'd Spectators shout around  And the long Isles and vaulted Roofs resound  Then snatch  a sudden Thought and turn thy Head  From the loud  Living  to the silent  Dead  With conscious Eye the neighb'ring Tombs survey  These will instruct thee better far then  They  What  now thou art  in yon gay Homage see  But  These  best shew  what thou art sure to be  I AM ignorant what Reception this excel∣lent Performance met with in the World but I hope for the Honour of my Country that it was not a bad oneThe whole Poem is full of Beauties but if it had no other Merit than appears in what I have here copied from it every candid Judge of Poetry must allow it to have deserved the highest Applause and Admiration  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Hic murus aheneus esto  Nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa  HOR  MONDAY  August    But thou shalt flourish in immortal Youth  Unhurt amidst the War of Elements  The Wreck of Matter and the Crush of Worlds  Add Cato  Mr PLAIN DEALER  I Am an old Man as you are and when I reflect on the fantastick Vicissitude of human Affairs when I consider the Short∣ness of Life and the small Pretensions I have to any longer Share in it it fills my Mind with something grave solemn and I must own melancholy but when I give my Thoughts a more unbounded Scope and pass over that short Intermission of Life into the Contemplation of an Eternal  Being my Mind recovers from that Gloom which the first Reflection fill'd me with and grows gay in Proportion to the Influ∣ence which this latter has upon it  I WAS last Night reading that celebrated Speech of  Cato  whence I have taken the Motto with which I head this Letter and whether it was from the serious Thoughts which that Soliloquy inspired or the last strong Glimpses of a Mind almost expiring and habituated to such Speculations I am not able to determine but I was no sooner fallen asleep than the following Dream or rather  Vision  grew into Form and fill'd my Fancy  METHOUGHT the dreadful Hour was come in which I was to resign this Life my Bed was surrounded by a silent Company of weeping Friends whose Sorrows touch'd me more than my own approaching Dissolution which happen'd in less Time than human Nature can con∣ceive and therefore though at that Period I felt it sensibly it is impossible I should now describe it I was no sooner freed from the Incumbrance and Obscurity of  Mat∣ter  but my Soul became refined to such an infinite Degree of Conception that my Eyes having nothing to interrupt or con∣fine their View were strengthen'd with such piercing Beams that they darted every Glance through an innumerable Pro∣gression  of Worlds and illuminated me with a particular and perfect Knowledge of the Harmony and Fabrick of each ex∣tended System  WHILST I was thus lost in Contem∣plation for infinite Spare like an endless Source still afforded me new Objects to nourish that inextinguishable Thirst of Knowledge which is the Employment of Eternal Life I felt a Heavenly Transport which diffus'd itself swifter than Thought through the Frame of my new Being and which at the same Time it made my Soul tremble with its Influence invigora∣ted and enabled it to support the Energy  I NOW enjoy'd perfect Felicity and whilst my Soul whose Desire of Know∣ledge increased in proportion with its Power to gratify it imploy'd each different Sen∣sation in pursuit of that Branch which which was peculiar to its Nature on a sud∣den I heard an universal Crack which seem'd to arise from the whole Number of created Worlds and resounded from Globe to Globe with a long Continuance of rever∣berated Uproars  AT last the Chain that link'd them in that dependant Order in which from the first Moment of their Creation they have perpetually been moving shiver'd of it∣self The loosen'd Orbs thus disunited began to roll with an unconceivable Swift∣ness through the vast Expanse of Space  and met and shock'd each other in the dark Vacuity The  Sun  now robb'd of Light whirl'd rapid and irregular The  Moon  let loose her Seas and rain'd a De∣luge in her falling The  fixed Stars  that from the Birth of Time had kept their appointed Stations no longer aw'd by the allpowerful  Word  broke loose and rush'd together Prodigious was the Sound and horrible the Conflict The Elements for∣getting their respective Qualities and urg'd by the immutable Decree met all and  mix'd  and lost themselves in ruinous Confusion  WHEN all seem'd bury'd in profoundest Darkness the wild Uproar ceas'd at once and as I wonder'd at this sudden Silence a Pyramid of Fire broke thro' that in a Moment enwrapp'd the Whole and having nothing left to prey upon at length devour'd it self  THUS was the  End  of  All  When from that inaccessible Brightness where the Di∣vine Presence conceals yet makes it self known a Beam of Day shot out which lighting up the infinite Extent of Heaven and rendering it transparent discover'd all its Glories I there perceiv'd the Stream of Life which running through the midst of Heaven  quicken'd  whereever it roll'd and watering the Tree of Knowledge nou∣rish'd it eternally Next I saw numberless Swarms of Beings like myself that fill'd  the Vastness of Infinitude and seem'd lost like me in Wonder Praise and Adora∣tion I heard a Voice which had more Influence than the most perfect Harmony of human Art and communicated itself to all alike cry  Come Eat of the Tree of Knowledge and Drink of the Water of Life  IMMEDIATELY the Angelick Host and all the Children of Earth who by Obedience to this Command were become one and the same eat and drank as they were commanded The first Effect of this that I found on myself and per∣ceived in all the rest was a perfect Recol∣lection of whatever I had done since my first entering into Life Various were the Consequences The  Ungrateful  the  Mur∣therer  the  Miser  the  False Friend  and the  Rebel  remember'd with Horror their past Crimes and grew frantick at every Thought with the Consciousness of what they had merited They felt the se∣verest Pangs of that most lively of all Torments  Despair  but the  Just  and those who had the least to reproach them∣selves with found yet they had too much to answer for when in the Book of Record which was thrown open to the View of all they perceived that the mi∣nutest of their Thoughts were registered  NOW we all became sensible how easy the Rule was by which we were to have  liv'd and how adapted to the required Obedience of human Nature Whilst we were thus lamenting our unhappy States and aggravating our Misery by SelfCon∣viction in an Instant we discover'd a fiercer Blaze of Light and beheld the my∣stick Veil drawn off that shrouded the Almighty's Presence Raised on a Throne to which the Brightness of the Sun would have been dim the Divine Father of all Things disclos'd Himself His Countenance was mildly aweful Paternal Tenderness shone out in every Feature of His Face and dis∣covered a Concern for us which we knew proceeded from a Divine Idea  That if He should be Merciful He must be more than Just  ON His Right Hand sat the  Second Person  our known  Redeemer  In Him the Beauty of the Father was divinely manifested In Him the Glory of His Power at once was soften'd and exerted Behind Him the fatal Figure of that Cross on which He suffer'd hung like a dread∣ful Comet prognosticating the Hour of Judgment On the Left was placed the  Third  Adorable Person in the now no longer  Mystick Union  In Him an equal Mixture of the Father and the Son re∣veal'd itself uniting in his Countenance the severest Glory of the One with the most ineffable Sweetness of the Other  BENEATH and on the Right of the World's triumphant Saviour sat his Twelve Disciples Their Eyes were fix'd on their great Master's Looks and seem'd to borrow thence by Reflection all their Softness and their Lustre In equal Sta∣tions on the Left of the  Holy Spirit  ap∣pear'd those Antient  Philosophers  who through the Dusk of Superstition and Ido∣latry by the Light of Reason and mere Nature saw and taught One True Eternal God and in Defence of that Be∣lief had Courage even to suffer Martyr∣dom  WHILST I contemplated this Divine Appearance I heard a Voice which pro∣ceeding thence pierc'd the profoundest Space of Heaven proclaming  That each should be his own Judge and from the Testi∣mony of his own Conscience acquit or con∣demn himself  IMMEDIATELY all the  Just  and those whose Consciences by due Allowances for the Frailties of human Nature could ac∣quit and encourage them advanced and with a Modesty at once more humble and assured than any thing on Earth as∣serted and made known their Virtues and Obedience to the Divine Commands concluding that though they had ac∣quitted themselves and were intitled by the  unalterable Word  to Everlasting Feli∣city yet could they not pretend to claim  it 'till they had received the Almighty Sanction which they hop'd for through the Mediation the Merits and the Blood of his beloved Son who died for Man's Redemption Pardon and Salvation Af∣ter which they prostrated themselves be∣fore the Throne and receiving Diadems of Glory  were admitted as Partakers of Beatitude without End  I THEN heard the same Voice repeat  Let each be his own Judge and from the Testimony of his own Conseience acquit or condemn himself  But far from seeing any more advance though still there were infi∣nite Numbers remaining I observ'd that they drew back reproaching each other beating their Breasts and making such Variety of Lamentations that the violent Noise awaken'd me in such a Mixture of Joy and Horror that it will be long be∣fore my Memory wears out the Impression of so strong a Vision which if it affects you enough to make you judge it worth publishing I shall have  slept  as I love to  wake  for the Service or Warning of others  I am SIR Your constant Reader  C D  THE PLAIN DEALER N  o    Obsequium amicos veritus odium parit  TEREN  Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit  Moenia  VIRG  Nil agit exemplum litem quod lite resolvit  HOR  FRIDAY  August    I was visited some Days ago by several of my distinguish'd Friends and on this Occasion must particularly name the  Major  and  Ned Volatile  in regard they were the principal Persons concerned in that After∣noon's Conversation which gave Birth to this Day's Paper  THE Discourse turn'd upon a Subject to which a late unhappy Rencounter furnish'd too many Materials 'Twas the Dispute be∣tween Two dear and inseparable Friends which ended not but with the Life of one of  them The Personal Acquaintance that some of us had with one or both of the Gen∣tlemen continued our Conversation longer and carried our Reflections farther than we should else have allow'd of at a Time when we met to give and receive a mutual Plea∣sure  THE  Point of Honour  which is usually the Foundation upon which these unhappy Dis∣putes are grounded was by the  Major  beau∣tifully explain'd and set in a just Light opposite to the too generally mistaken Notions of that noble Qualification and which  Ned  had too warmly debated 'till  Will Weather∣cock  diverted his pushing it to Extremity by the seasonable Interposition of his peculiar Judgment  Will's  Decisions as the  Pagans  painted their  Janus  always appear with  Two Faces  which favour both Parties and recon∣cile them in good Humour Nevertheless we could not leave the Subject intirely with∣out a Progress of Reflection upon the Fa∣tality of sudden Startings and ungovernable Passions which are too much indulg'd and but too little provided against by the Gene∣rality of Mankind  I REMEMBER 'twas agreed to that most of the ill Blood Debates and Quarrels that happen owe their Original to Unconcern and Carelesness about our Humour in Conver∣sation A Man must be Master of himself and preserve a watchful Guard over his Be∣haviour in Company if he would either  please  or be  pleased  There is a natural Liberty which all Mankind claims by Right but the mistaken Use of it leads to Mischief A li∣centious or rambling Tongue proves as in∣jurious to Society as Treason to a State and Traitors smart no more frequently for  This Guilt  than Prattlers for  That Folly  NED VOLATILE  not yet quite cool broke in upon our Chain of Reasoning by as∣serting  'That a strict Watch over one's Words Actions and Humour in all Companies is a Restraint which in his Opinion dif∣fer'd nothing from Torture What said he must I be always under the Slavery of  thinking  before I speak Shall I never have the Pleasure of expressing my own Senti∣ments Who would sacrifice his natural Rights to please another Man Would any but a  Fool  or  Flatterer  praise what he  hates  or declare himself an Enemy to what he  loves  merely to shew his  good Humour  or  Complaisance  No Gentlemen I maintain That  Grandeur itself  would be too dear bought at this Priee and whoever affirms the contrary is no Friend to  PlainDealing  HE paus'd here and look'd at me for Ap∣probation I was going to distinguish and remark the Circumstances that should be punctually regarded when the  Major  begg'd to be heard  'The Restraint said he that you represent so dreadful gives more Satis∣faction than Pain Your Complaisance  and good Humour is more your own In∣terest than your Companion's Is it not for your own Sake that you accommodate yourself to his Humour from whom you hope good Offices or expect agreeable En∣terainment Do you take for Dissimulation a Guard of Prudence which induces you to seem in the Sentiments of a Man whom you would willingly draw into yours when either your Interest or Inclination requires it For my Part I think you have a Right to applaud yourself when you can enter agreeably into opposite Humours What induc'd all the Anticents to admire the pliant Conduct of  Alcibiades  And why do we  still wonder  that a Man could so aptly accommodate himself to the dif∣ferent Manners of the several Countries where he liv'd Nothing was so much talk'd of at  Athens  as his  Eloquence  and  Gallantry  Among the  Persians  he was always  feasting  and nothing was seen more splendid than his  Dress  and  Equipage  but he pass'd over to opposite Manners when he was obliged to go to  Sparta  for  there  the most rigid  Lacedemonian  led a Life less  austere  than  Alcibiades  '  ALCIBIADES  cry'd  Ned Volatile  was an Affector of  Popularity  His Maxim was like that of a Friend of mine  Cum fueris Romae Romano vivito More  But hang itI hate that Suppleness of Humour It may be necessary for Embassadors and  Travellers but  Ned Volatile  has nothing to do with it  HE was proceeding in his usual Volubility of Speech when I interrupted him in the following Manner  'I AM sorry my Friend  Volatile  would de∣cry one of the Blessings upon which the Happiness of  Society  is in a great Measure founded The Commerce of Life requires our Regard to Variety of Humours every Day and when  Nature  denies the Mastery of them Men should endeavour to  acquire  it Who would not  rejoice with  a Friend new∣ly and happily married  Congratulate one  just arrived from his Travels Or  Condole  with  another  on the Loss of an only and valuable Son This is no Suppleness no Inequality of Humour 'Tis a Sweetness 'tis a Virtue Tell me Would not your∣self in the Presence of a Gay Prince de∣voted to his Pleasures appear with a chearful Countenance Or Would you accost with a smiling Air a cloudy and suspicious one No more is it fitting to carry a Passi∣on into Company disagreeable to that which reigns in it or to discover a  Mien  which condemns the Sentiments wherewith the Company is prepossessed In short no∣thing is more opposite to the Maxims of Civil Society than an Opinionative and Dog∣matical Conduct and he who will obstinate∣ly follow it is in Danger of never getting new Friends and even of losing his old  ones I wish I could say That these Duels and Deaths we have been speaking of are not its common Consequences  'I HAVE heard and enter into your Senti∣ments with Pleasure said  Ned Volatile  but allow me at least to affirm That one who is thus Master of his Temper must never abuse this Power never betray his Senti∣ments in maintaining an Error or in giv∣ing Praises to Words or Actions that he is sensible do not deserve it  'RIGHT answered I  How  then said he or  wherein  do you appear Master of your HumourWhen I submit it replied I to that of others or decline my own Will to theirs to whom I would shew a Deference my  Words  at least my  Silence  should carry Tokens of my Complaisance As for Example Did one whom I would not displease commend an ill Man not well known to him or who had wrong'd or disoblig'd me In such Case I would stifle and conceal my Resentment and be silent since I could not be of the same Opinion with a Person whom I was unwilling to offend  'NO no cry'd  Ned Volatile  if ever I sub∣ject my Humour it shall be to the  Ladies  There are many  Capricio's  that must be borne with from them but in all other Cases  my Mind is my Kingdom I am absolute and will be so  '  HE ran on to this Purpose near a Quar∣ter of an Hour and at last happening to touch again on the Article of Honour and Friendship which had introduc'd the Subject of our Discourse the  Major  requested him to hear a Story in which an  Example  of both these valuable Distinctions would better plead for their right Use than any Account he could give of  his own particular Sense  of them The Story said the  Major  is Modern but not well known and amongst all the Instances of Bravery is a fine and uncommon Display of it 'Tis what most  Fighters  would think below them yet what none but a Con∣queror could come up to  ALTAMONT  and  Honorius  were both Men of Quality and of Eminence in the Army wherein they had served long in Friendship together  Altamont  was deservedly placed in the full Height of Power and Preferment  Honorius  inferior but a small Degree in Post was greatly so in Fortune but he was fill'd with Princely Virtues and his Soul had a distinguish'd Greatness He had been a Sharer in the whole Course of  Altamont  's innumerable Glories  Honorius  on some afterOccasion whether as suppos'd by  Altamont  's Breach of Promise or what other Ground for Resent∣ment happened is neither known nor mate∣rial to be debated 'tis sufficient to tell you That  Honorius  was so disoblig'd that he sent  Altamont  a Challenge to determine their Difference in a Duel at a Time appointed in  HydePark  AT the Time in which  Altamont  received this Challenge he was soo deeply ingaged in a Trust whereon depended the Preservation of the King's Person and Government that he could not sacrifice or neglect them by risquing his important Life in a Personal Quarrel at that Juncture but knowing well the Honour and Bravery of  Honorius  and jealous too of his own he sent for  Carolinus  early that Morning in which he was to fight  '  Brother  said he You know how much of the Weight of Government lies at this Time upon my Shoulders and there are some secret Concerns of State to which you are yet a Stranger I am called upon to a  Duel  It concerns a Case of  Honour  and my Adversary is a Man of Bravery  You  must meet him in my Stead and give him the Satisfaction he requires'  CAROLINUS  resolved to act in his Brother's Cause as in his own without Delay went to meet his unknown Opponent but when he arrived at the destin'd Spot he was con∣founded to see him the  dearest Friend he had upon Earth  'Good God said  Honorius  to what am I fated I expected your  Brother  and is it  You  my  Carolinus  '  It is  replied  Carolinus  with a Sigh They gaz'd on each other their Breasts were agitated by a Tem∣pest of warring PassionsAfter a Length of silent Confusion  Honorius  thus addressed himself to  Carolinus    'You are that very Friend I ever called and thought  you You are the Man who have so often vow'd the most sincere and exalted Friend∣ship for me'  'I am replied  Carolinus  and I bring with me the same devoted Heart a Sacrifice to your Disposal If you survive you will know my Innocence and the Cause why I am here which weighty Reasons forbid the Discovery of at present But come  Since it must be thus  '  They both advanc'd and in that Instant  Honorius  cry'd  Hold my  Carolinus  'Tis done The Struggle of my Soul is over and our Dis∣pute at an End I am determin'd I will not I cannot break the Chain that has bound our Souls so long together no not for your Bro∣ther's Power or my Prince's Crown  They continued some Time in Disorder and Expo∣stulation Both of them were brave sove∣reignly brave and none ever lived who better knew what Honour was or could de∣fend it more nobly  HONORIUS  went on  'Well my Friend 'till now I never felt Extre∣mity Your Brother who has done me Wrong ought to give me Satisfaction and were he here I could not sheath my Sword unsatisfied but you are my  Friend  with whom  I can have no Difference  I would die a Thousand Deaths to  save  or to  serve  you and I will put the greatest Force up∣on my Nature and even  ask Pardon  of the Man who has  injur'd  me rather than ha∣zard a Life so much more precious than  my own But let us leave this Place with Speed I'll give up my Resentment Let your Brother let the World treat my Conduct at their Pleasure There is no∣thing but my Hopes of Heaven that I would not hazard for my  Carolinus  He went and did as he said and whatever Constructions the World might put upon  Altamont  's Behaviour and  Honorius  's Con∣deseension a noble Example was here gi∣ven of the most generous and exalted Friendship and of that absolute  SelfConquest  which  Solomon  the wisest of all Men prefers to the  Conquering of a City  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Scribere jussit Amor  OVID  MONDAY  August    I DEDICATE this Paper to the Ladies for I design it as a Lesson of  Love  which a certain perverse Foreigner will have to be no more than a Phantom  Because  says he  Like an Apparition Every Body has heard of but Nobody has seen it  IT is much easier indeed  to love  than to explain  what Love is  For it is one among the  Paradoxes  of that ungovernable Passion that it strikes the Tongue  dumb  but makes every other Part of the Body  eloquent  THE  Major  to please  Ned Volatile  has indulg'd him the Perusal of that PICTURE OF LOVE from which he recited the Verses in my XXXIVth PaperI had the Mis∣fortune to be present and to hear him read it over I call it a  Misfortune  because my Passion for that wild  Insensible  my Coquet who is rambled away to  Tunbridge  was half suppress'd before for want of Occasion to in∣flame it but has rekindled itself at the Fire which it catch'd from this unlucky Picture and I now bleed afresh like a dead Body at the Touch of its Murderer  YET why do I complain that I am sen∣sible of a generous Passion which to lay aside the Pride of Wisdom and the Forma∣lity of Age and Gravity he who is insensi∣ble of is  stupid  The Philosopher de∣fin'd Love prettily when he said It was a  Circle  returning  through  Happiness  to  Happiness  from  Happiness The Emblem was ingenious and the Lover's  Ring  is a pro∣per and significant Allusion to it  I AM so far when I think  seriously  from being asham'd to be call'd a  Lover  that I am sincerely of Opinion that whoever has not lov'd has put his Virtues to no TryalLove is the Breeze of Life A healthful  and refreshing  Gale  which by its Agitation of the Spirits keeps our Faculties in lively Motion so as neither to stagnate in un∣fruitful Rest nor drive tempestuously with the most stormy PassionsThe Heart of a Lover is impress'd with Sweetness and Humanity His Soul receives Extension beyond its natural Power and is as much more refin'd than a  selfish  common Soul as that Soul which it so excels is above the Body it belongs to  THERE is something in Love that is stronger than  Calamity  and more gentle than  Pity  serener than  Silence  more splendid than  Riches  and statelier than  Honour  More trembling than  Fear  and more charming than  Pleasure  It is even more powerful than  Conscience  For whom we love we imagine always  present  and passing Judg∣ment on our most secret Purposes We re∣gulate them therefore according to our Apprehension of what She would  approve  or  condemn  and so supply ourselves with a constant Vigilance and Propensity to noble Actions  IN some Sense he who  loves  may be said to be  like a God  for he has but one Care and  That  a Great and a Heavenly One He is wholly intent upon  Beneficence  He has the Prophet's sacred Privilege to be rapp'd out of himself To enjoy per∣petual Ecstacy To be emptied of his own Soul that he may be animated by one  more dear to himOur Ideas of the Joys of  Heaven  can represent them no other than that we are there to  love  and to  be beloved  And they who love here on Earth are  above  the World while they are  in it  Nor can  Death  disunite Lovers so in∣tirely as it does other People since  Love  dies not with the  Object lov'd  She lives so te∣naciously in our charm'd and retentive  Memory  that her Death seems no more than a long and lamented Absence ra∣ther indearing than defacing her ImageSo that  This  is the only Difference which Death seems capable of making when he interposes between  Lovers  While both  liv'd  their  Two Bodies  had no more than  One Soul  And now one is  dead  their  Two Souls  hove no more than  One Body  NEITHER has  Age  that alters all Things a Power to deface our  Love  for whom we love can never seem Old Our Remem∣brance presents her Beauty everlastingly in its Spring And her Idea is retain'd inchanting∣ly in the very Attitude which first she struck us by  THE restless but unwearied Lover seeks for himself  out of himself  Let him gaze touch listen and be bless'd for ever yet still he  longs  and is unsatisfiedThere is a Dropsy in his Mind and his Thirst augments with drinkingHis Soul is either not at home or in a starting and im∣patient PostureIf he presses his  Charmer's Hand it darts with Violence into his  Fingers  If he leans at her lov'd Side it beats against his  Breast  as if it would break its Prison to be  nearer  her When she speaks it is in his  Ear  When he looks on her it is in his  Eye  But he has  no Soul at all  when she is absent  Absent from her in whom alone we live  Life grows a  Bankrupt  and no Bliss can give  Friends are importunate and Pleasures lost  What once most charm'd us now disgusts us most  Fretful to silent Solitudes we run  And Men and Light and noisy Converse shun  Pensive in Woods on Rivers Sides we walk  And to th' unlistning Winds and Waters talk  How next we shall approach her pleas'd we weigh  And  think  in Transport All we mean to say  Tenderly bowing  Thus  will we complain  Thus  court her Pity And  Thus  plead our Pain  Thus  sigh for fancied Frowns if Frowns shou'd rise  And  Thus  meet Favours in her softning Eyes  Restless on Paper we our Vows repeat  And pour our  Souls  out on the letter'd Sheet  Write blot restore and in lost Pieces rend  The  Mute Entreaters  yet too faint to send  Unbless'd when no Admission we procure  'Tis Heav'n at Distance to discern her Door  Or to her Window we by Night repair  And let loose Fancy to be feasted there  Watch her lov'd Shadow as it glances by  And to imagin'd Motions chain our Eye  Has she some Field or Grove or Garden bless'd  Pleas'd we retread the Paths her Feet have press'd  Near her by Chance at Visits or at Plays  Our rushing Spirits croud in  speaking Gaze  Light on her varied Airs our Eyeballs ride  Dark as the Dead to the full World beside  LOVERS converse like Angels by a kind of  Intuition  They  hear  one another's  Souls  and prevent each other's  Wishes  Like Divinities quitting their Shrines they disrobe themselves of their  Bodies  and intermingle their meeting  Minds  as we see Two  Lights  incorporateTheir Souls glide out from their Eyes to snatch Embraces at a Di∣stance and return inrich'd with the fan∣cy'd TreasureThere is more Harmony in Love than in Musick A Harmony like that which the old Philosophers imputed to the Spheres Only Two Spheres are  acted  by one and the same  Intelligence  For the Strings of Two Hearts sympathize like those of Two Lutes with correspondent Trepida∣tions  HOW mistaken are they who call Love an  idle  Passion  Thought  itself is scarce more active There is an unsatisfied and continual Thirst in the Appetite of a Lover  A constant Spring in his Delights and Tor∣ments He pursues his Discoveries with a restless and impatient Vigour And tho' like the shining heavenly Bodies he is everlastingly in Motion yet he is so far from becoming weary that he is rather refresh'd by his Labour  I WILL copy yet farther from the Pi∣cture abomentioned the following  Group  or Assembly of the  Symptoms Moles  and  To∣kens  of this PassionIt is upon the Lover's first Approach to his Mistress's Person We recover slowly from our sweet Surprize says this  Doctor  of  Cupid  's  College  and ad∣vancing with a blushful Tenderness  Bowing we kneel and her giv'n Hand is press'd  With sweet Compulsion to our beating Breast  O'er it in Ecstacy our Lips bend low  And Tides of Sighs 'twixt her grasp'd Fingers flow  High beats the hurried Pulse at each forc'd Kiss  And ev'ry burning Sinew  akes  with  Bliss  Life in a  Souly Deluge  rushes o'er  And the charm'd Heart springs out at ev'ry Pore  The first fierce Raptures of Amazement past  Confusion quits us and Desire grows fast  We sit And while her gaz'd at Wonders rise  A humid Brightness fills our sparkling Eyes  Modest Disquiet every Action wears  And each long Look the Mark of Passion bears  Disorder'd Nature no cold  Medium  keeps  Transport now reigns and dull Reflection sleeps  All that we wish or feel or act or say  Is above  Thought  and out of  Reason's  Way  Joy murmurs Anger laughs and Hope looks sad  Rashness grows prudent and Discretion mad  Restless we feel our am'rous Bosom burn  Now This Way  look  we And now That Way  turn  Now in sweet  Swell  of Thought our lifted Eyes  Lose their low Languor and attempt to rise  Now sinking suppliant seek the Charmer's Feet  And court wish'd Pity in their glanc'd Retreat  Oft in full Gaze they  dwell  upon her Face  Then start astonish'd from some dazling Grace  Now in bold Liberty fly out unbid  Now aw'd 'scape inward 'twixt the closing Lid  If we dare  speak  and wou'd our Wish pursue  The Words fall feath'ry like descending Dew  The soft'ning Accents ev'n in Utt'rance die  And the  Tongue  's Sweetness here outcharms the  Eye  'Till mingled Sighs our fainting Voice confound  But Lovers Meanings  speak  though robb'd of  Sound  I AM fond of thinking we might draw from Love a Proof of the  Soul's Immortality  What else mean our Desires when they ex∣tend themselves beyond the utmost that willing Nature can indulge us inWhy else are the Joys of Love mix'd with me∣lancholy  and unsatisfied TremblingsThey increase indeed and refine the Plea∣sure But they convince us That there  is  a Union more adapted to our Mind's free Es∣sence and which Bodies are not  fine  enough to permit them the Enjoyment of  HENCE that exquisite  Expansion  That  Liquefaction  of the Heart when it refuses to allow us the Possession of our dearest Wish in the very Moment we become Masters of it The subtle Workings of this exalted Pas∣sion upon the Refinements of our Mind have  Deified  the beloved Object 'till we faint with Awe when we should receive her Ten∣derness And by a fantastical kind of Envy consider ourselves as our own RivalsThe  supremest Joy  of Love must if Men will have it so be  call'd Bodily  But All that heightens it to be worth the Wish of a wise Man it must be indebted to the  Mind  forWhence could Images so  warm  as these which follow receive a Purity in their Expression that adapts them to the chastest Ear if the  Mind  's Part were not strongest even where the  Body  pretends most Influence  Is there no more Oh yet the  Last  remains  Crown of our Conquest Sweetner of our Pains  There  is a Time  when Love no Wish denies  And smiling Nature throws off All Disguise  But who can  Words  to speak those Raptures find  Vast  Sea of Ecstacy  that drowns the Mind  That fierce Transfusion of  exchanging  Hearts  That gliding Glimpse of Heav'n in pulsive Starts  That  veiny Rush  That warm tumultuous  Roll  That Fire that kindles  Bodies  into  Soul  And on Life's  Margin  strains Delight so high  That  Sense  breaks shortand while we  taste  we  die  BUT I am going I know not whither The Painter of this  Picture  has bewitch'd me from my Purpose which was to have enter'd upon a  Philosophical  Dissertation concerning the  Qualities  of Love Instead of which I am rambling into a  natural  one upon the  Effects  of it  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Partes speculamur in omnes  CLAUD  FRIDAY  August    IN my XXXVIth Paper I published some Remarks on an excellent Old Bal∣lad called WILLIAM and MARGARET I was charm'd with the Strength and Beau∣ties of its masculine Simplicity and really took it to  be  what it  appear'd  The Work of some Old Poet long since  dead  but I have been agreeably undeceiv'd The Author of it is alive and a  NorthBriton  I congratulate his Country on the Promise of this rising Genius For the Gentleman it seems is ve∣ry young and received his Education in the University of  Edinburgh  AMONG many fine Qualities which adorn him he is so unconscious of his own Merit or possesses it with so sincere a Modesty that he declines being publickly nam'd But as he  has oblig'd me with a Letter containing the short History of an unhappy Accident which gave Occasion to his Ballad it will be an agreeable Entertainment if I publish it as the Author sent it me  SIR  YOUR PLAIN DEALER of  July  the th was sent to me by a Friend I must own after I had read it over I was both surpriz'd and pleas'd to find that a simple Tale of my Writing had merited the Notice and Approbation of the Au∣thor of the PLAIN DEALER  AFTER what you have said of WILLIAM and MARGARET I flatter myself that you will not be displeas'd with an Account of the Accident which gave Birth to that Ballad  YOUR Conjecture that it was founded on the real History of an unhappy Woman is trueA vain young Gentleman had for some Time professed Love to a Lady then in the Spring of her Life and Beauty He dress'd well talk'd loud and spoke Nonsense with  Spirit  She had good Understanding but was too young to know the World I have seen her very often There was a lively Innocence in her Look She had never been address'd to by a Man of  Sense  And therefore knew not how despicable and unsincere a  Fool  is In time he persuaded her that there was  Merit in his PassionShe believ'd him and was  undone  SHE was upon the Point of bringing in∣to the World the Effect of her illplac'd Love before her Father knew the Misfor∣tune Judge the Sentiments of the good Old Man yet his Affection outweighed his Anger He could not think of aban∣doning his Child to Want and Infamy He applied himself to her false Lover with an Offer of Half his Fortune But the Temper of the Betrayer was savag'd with cruel Inso∣lence He rejected the Father's Offers and re∣proach'd the Innocence he had ruin'd with the Bitterness of open Scorn The News was brought her when in a weak Condi∣tion and cast her into a Fever And in a few Days after I saw her and her Child laid in one Grave together  IT was some Time after this That I chanc'd to look into a Comedy of  Fletcher  's called  The Knight of the burning Pestle  The Place I fell upon was where old  Mer∣ryThought  repeats these Verses  When it was grown to dark Midnight  And all were fast asleep  In came  Margaret  's grimly Ghost  And stood at  William  's Feet  WHICH I fancy was the Beginning of some Ballad commonly known at the Time when this Author wroteThese  Lines naked of Ornament and simple as they are struck my Fancy I clos'd the Book and bethought myself that the un∣happy Adventure I have mentioned above which then came fresh into my Mind might naturally raise a Tale upon the Appearance of this GhostIt was then Midnight All round me was still and quiet These concurring Circumstances work'd my Soul to a powerful Melancholy I could not sleep And at that Time I finish'd my little Poem such as you see it here If it continues still to deserve your Approbation I have my Aim and am  SIR  Your most Obliged And most humble Servant  c  IT  does  most justly continue to deserve and will  for ever  deserve not only Ap∣probation but the Applause of all true Judges of Wit and Nature The Author's Copy which he inclos'd to me is different in several Places from that which fell into my Hands but the Sense of both is exactly the same and the Variation in some Ex∣pressions not considerable enough to make it necessary to republish that excellent Ballad  HAVING this Occasion to speak of  Scot∣land  I judge it the properest Place to insert my Acknowledgment of a Letter from  Edin∣burgh  sign'd  Fergus Bruce  I take this Name to be fictitious but whoever the  Writer  is I am pleas'd with his  propos'd Cor∣respondence  which will open a New Scene of Intelligence to the Expectation of my Rea∣ders as they may see by the following Ex∣tract of the Letter itself which is writ with the Politeness of a Gentleman and in the Stile of a Man of Learning  Edinburgh  the th of  July    SIR  THE first PLAIN DEALER that came to my Hand was that where∣in you represent in true Colours the Character and Conduct of the present Emperor of  Russia  with Regard to his Son Prince  Alexei  My Fancy was charm'd and my Judgment intirely satisfied with the Account you gave Our CoffeeHouses take in your Papers and I observe with Pleasure the Welcome which our politest People receive them with Not the Men alone of all Ranks but the Ladies also make them their Entertainment The ge∣neral Conversation of both Sexes turns on the Matter you afford  I CANNOT help writing to you that I may let you know your Influence It must  be a Pleasure to your generous Soul to be conscious of the Extent and Power of its Beneficence And I should be wanting in my Duty to the Man who gives me Weekly Delight and Instruction if I con∣ceal'd from him what might any way contribute to his Satisfaction  I WILL presume if you please to send you nowandthen my Reflections upon the Matter which the  Beaux  and  Belles  of this City may furnish for a PLAINDEALER Something happens here every Day not un∣worthy Publick Notice And there are a Thousand Things that fall naturally un∣der your Cognizance that neither the  King  the  Parliament  the  Pulpit  or the  Bench  have any Thing to do with Perhaps too it would be of Use to our Gentry at  Edin∣burgh  to know you have a  Spy  here up∣on their Conduct Pray tell them so and depend on the most watchful Fidelity of  SIR  Your sincere Friend And most humble Servant  FERGUS BRUCE  I CANNOT forbear confessing that I shall expect with a very sensible Pleasure the Event of this Northern Correspondence For I have retain'd from my Infancy a kind  of affectionate Partiality for the generous Bravery and gallant Plainness of our Bro∣thers beyond  Tweed  When I travell'd in my Youth I scarce ever saw a Court even in the remotest Parts of the civiliz'd World where some Gentleman or other a  Scot  by Birth or Descent was not one of its noblest Ornaments And now since the  Muses  and the  Graces  have very visibly from the Begin∣ning of the present Century fix'd and seated themselves in their learned Seminaries their rising Youth of both Sexes seem to vie with one another in a warm and generous Emulation which shall most adorn their own or soonest match the Elegance of other even the po∣litest Nations  NOT the Gentlemen alone but the very Ladies of  Edinburgh  form themselves into select and voluntary  Societies  for the Im∣provement of their Knowledge instead of the Entertainment of their Fancy And go on at the same Time to refine their Conversa∣tion inrich their Understanding and polish and render amiable their Personal Deport∣ment  I SHALL in the Course of my Observa∣tions take Occasion to demonstrate the Truth of this Remark by a Variety of Particulars which while they are doing Justice to the  North  will contribute in no small Degree to the Pleasure of the  South  Part of this King∣dom At present I shall produce but Two Instances And the First is A Society of  Young Gentlemen most if not all of them Students in the University of  Edinburgh  who from a Sympathy of Affections found∣ded on a Similitude of  Parts  and  Genius  have united themselves into a Body under Title of THE GROTESQUE CLUB the Reason of which Name I shall explain in a future Paper Their Business to express it in the Words of one of their own Members is  A Friendship that knows no Strife but that of a generous Emulation to excell in Virtue Learn∣ing and Politeness  TO how surprizing a Degree these fine Spirits have succeeded in their noble  End  let the following Sentiments declare conceiv'd and express'd with all the Clearness Depth and Strength of an  experienc'd Philosopher  by a Member of this  Grotesque Club  who was in his  Fourteenth Year only  when he compos'd in Blank Verse a Poem now in my Hands and founded on a Supposition of the Author's sitting a whole Summer Night in a Gar∣den looking upward and quite losing him∣self in Contemplation on  the Works and Wonders of Almighty Power  If this was a Subject naturally above the Capacity of so very a Boy to what a Degree does it in∣crease our Wonder when we find it treated in this Masterly Manner  Now I survey'd my native Faculties  And trac'd my Actions to their teeming Source  Now I explor'd the universal Frame  Gaz'd Nature through and with interior Light  Convers'd with Angels and unbody'd Saints  That tread the Courts of the  Eternal King  Gladly I would declare in lofty Strains  The Power of  Godhead  to the Sons of Men  But Thought is  lost  in its Immensity  Imagination wastes its Strength in vain  And Fancy  tires  and  turns  within itself  Struck with th'amazing  Depths  of  Deity  Ah my lov'd God in vain a tender Youth  Unskill'd in Arts of deep Philosophy  Attempts to search the bulky Mass of  Matter  To trace the Rules of  Motion  and pursue  The Phantom  Time  too subtle for his Grasp  Yet may I from thy most  apparent Works  Form some Idea of their wondrous Author  And celebrate  thy Praise  with rapt'rous Mind  How can I gaze upon yon  sparkling Vault  And view the  Planets  rolling in their Spheres  Yet be an  Atheist  Can I see those  Stars  And  think  of others far beyond my Ken  Yet want Conviction of creating Power  What but a Being of immense Perfection  Cou'd through unbounded Spaces thus dispose  Suth num'rous Bodies All presumptive  Worlds  The undesigning Hand of giddy  Chance  Cou'd never fill with Globes so vast so bright  That lofty Conclave  Where shall I trace the  Sources  of the  Light  What Seats assign to th' Element of  Fire  That unconfin'd thro' all the  Systems  breaks  Here cou'd I lie in Contemplation wrapt  And pass with Pleasure an eternal Age  But 'tis too much for my weak Mind to know  Teach me with humble Reverence to  adore  The Mysteries I  must not comprehend  LET this  prodigious Young Man  bear the Blame of my not having left myself Room in this Paper to pay that Respect which I intended to THE FAIR INTELLECTUALS A Club of Ladies at  Edinburgh  who set a Pattern to  Female Excellence  And whose  His∣tory Rules  and  Constitutions  I have the Pleasure to see before me with the conventual Address of  Mistress Speaker  to the lovely  Sisterhood  and the  admissory Speech  of one of the Ladies as set forth by the able Pen of  Mistress Secretary  I shall say more on a future Occasion of the Honour done to the whole Sex by the dangerous Ambition of these Ladies And of the Political Necessity which I conceive there will soon be of putting a Stop to the Progress of such un∣limitted Improvement of a Power already too exorbitant  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Veniunt a Dote Sagittae  JUV  MONDAY  August    I HAVE endeavour'd to shew in a for∣mer Paper that Parents are highly to blame when they force their Children to marry for the Sake of a Fortune which can never repair the least of those innumerable Mischiefs that are inseparably annexed to it Using Authority in such a Case turns the most Indulgent of Fathers into an insupport∣able Tyrant who by one inconsiderate De∣cree that is irreversible dooms his own Child to the most doleful Imprisonment for Life The following Epistle gives us so sad but so lively a Representation of this Truth that I insert it for the Sake of those who might possibly be betrayed in their Conduct to give the same fatal Proofs of their Affection to their Offspring that seem to  Edge  all the Sufferings of our present Complainant  SIR  I AM a Young Man about Three and Twenty that much against my Will have complied with the incessant Importu∣nities of my Friends or rather obey'd the absolute Commands of an indulgent Father and a fond Mother in marrying a very Rich Maid of about Thirty Six who it seems is only mine because several Sui∣ters of equal Pretensions in Wealth with herself that liked her Person left her as soon as they had conversed with her suffici∣ently to sound her Temper  BEFORE I married her I enjoyed Health and good Humour and thought my For∣tune good enough as it was and abundant∣ly sufficient with a Female Companion that brought the like Ingredients towards it to make Life tolerably happy  SHE has not been my Wife quite a Year and yet has managed her Time so well that she has robb'd me of all my Quiet The natural Gayety of my Disposition is sowr'd almost enough to make me think of grow∣ing her Torturer as she is mine The Flo∣ridness of Health has left me and I am overcome by an inward Pining that wastes me outwardly In fine she has convinced me that a Man may be emphatically Poor in the Affluence of Wealth and truly and properly said to Want amidst the Abun∣dance of all Things  I HAVE industriously studied to shew Gratitude and true Friendship For I really had an Intention to render my∣self as agreeable as possible and the more because during the Time of our  modish  Courtship she had told those from whom I should hear it again that she lik'd me By this  habitual Art  of  Tender∣ness  I almost brought it to be  Natural  and began to deceive myself into an Opini∣on that I should not be incapable of even  loving  her at last She in Return began after a manner  then  perfectly unaccountable to do every Thing not only that she thought would disoblige me but that she knew would be a sincere Affliction to me I find  since  I am taken by way of shew∣ing she could have  her Man  and I am the Subject of her Revenge because she lost the Person she had a Liking to  SHE is a Woman of a strong but mis∣chievous Understanding and letting it be  guided  by what it should  correct  her  Hu∣mour  which is my inveterate Enemy she can be as poignantly cruel to me as she plea∣ses She lets me know by broad Hints that she  sees  what would delight me but is  blind  like a  Jew  out of Hardness of Heart If I ask how I may oblige her she is  Dumb  but if I drop an ambiguous Word that may be tortured into a malig∣nant Construction she can use her Tongue like a LarumIf I explain the Sim∣plicity  of my Meaning and beg Pardon for want of Caution in expressing myself her  Ears  are  shut  and she is like the  Deaf Adder  The Comparison is true beyond the  Deafness  she is like it in my Bosom she stings like it she poisons like it only with this Difference That her Poison is of an  Italian kind  it lengthens out Torment and kills at Distance of Years after a painful Confinement  IN my Father's Presence this fair Hy∣pocrite is never  dumb  but ever  eloquent  in  my  PraiseSuch a Husband and such a Wife We are the happiest CoupleThen she calls often upon me with an Air of Friendship to be merry under the Ef∣fects of the Melancholy she causes Her  Eyes  her  Ears  her  Tongue  her  Hands  seem all too little to oblige meThe Old Gentleman doats on herI help to carry on the  Farce  it would be  Tragedy  if he knew otherwiseHe blesses his Stars and very comfortably puts me in Mind how much I possess the Joy he wished me  WHAT is to be done with this Riddle of a Woman so much  in  her Senses and  out  of them as she pleases What Pro∣spect can I have of Happiness but from her Death whom by my Publick Vow and  hardtugg'd Virtue  I am obliged to sup∣port  in Sickness  I WOULD never have complain'd but that I hope it may be a proper Caution and serve for the Preservations of others I am pleas'd that I never discover'd these Grievances because had I complained eve∣ry Time I had Occasion I should have been asham'd to complain any longer and she would have appeared as irreprehensible as an Angel Thus I have a Fortune which has been the Purchase of Misery To make me rich my Relations have made me wretched and for my part I have nothing to hope but that long Patience and Sufferings may make me insensible  I am SIR Your most humble Servant  A Z  TO what a Multitude of Sorrows is this genteel Complainer betray'd The first Con∣siderations that ought to precede a Matri∣monial Choice are the Piety Education Person and Liking of both Parties indeed a competent Fortune is a material Conside∣ration to be weighed together with the others but never separately from them Of this  Pliny  the politest Gentleman as well as finest Writer of his Age has given us a satis∣factory Account in Two of his Epistles which I am glad for the Benefit of the La∣Ladies  to find published in Two Volumes in in  Eaglish  In one he shews us his Judg∣ment in chusing a Husband for a Friend's Relation in the other the happy Effects of a judicious Choice in the Person of his own Wife  To  JUNIUS MAURITIUS  on chusing a Husband for his Relation  THE particular Opinion you have of my Choice of a Husband for your Brother's Daughter is very obliging you well know how much I loved and esteemed that great Man with what Advice he che∣rished my Youth and by his own Com∣mendation gave me the Credit of being thought Praiseworthy You could have in∣joined me nothing of greater Consequence or more agreeable nor any Thing I would undertake with more Honour than to chuse a Man fit to continue the Family of  Arulenus Rusticus  which indeed might prove a Work of Time did not  Minucius Acilianus  luckily present who as young Men do each other for he is some Years younger loves me intimately yet treats me with a Respect due to Age He is plea∣sed to be form'd and instructed by me as I us'd to be by you His Country is  Bresica  of that Part of our  Italy  that does yet re∣tain and keeps up much of the Antient Modesty Frugality and even Rusticity His Father  Minucius Macrinus  eminent in  the  Equestrian  Order for he aimed no high∣er being chose by  Vespasian  into the  Prae∣torian  with great Constancy preferr'd an honest Ease to this our Ambition shall I call it or Honour His Grandmother of the Mother's Side is  Serana Procula  of  Pa∣dua  you are acquainted with the Manners of the Place yet  Serana  is to the  Patavins  an Example of strict Virtue His Uncle  P Acilius  is a Man of singular Discretion Prudence and Honesty in Truth you will meet with nothing in

Tribune  and  Praetor  with Abundance of Credit yet he has re∣ferr'd it to you to make his Court for him He has a comely Face a sanguine Comple∣ction his whole Person Gentlemanlike with a becoming Gravity in his Mein Things I think not to be disregarded but due to the Merit of a virtuous Woman I am in Doubt whether I need take No∣tice of the large Estate of his Father for when I consider You for whom we propose a SoninLaw I think I need not When I reflect on the  Common Custom  and even the Laws of the City which principally have Regard to the Fortunes of Men  that  seems by no Means to be omitted and to one that thinks of Posterity this in  the making of a Match is not the least material Consideration Perhaps you will think I have indulged too much the Love of my Friend in this Account but I will stake my Credit you shall find every thing exceed my Description I love the young Man indeed most ardently as he deserves but it is the Duty of Friendship to be mo∣derate in Commendation  To  HISPULLA  his Wife's Aunt  AS I remember that great Affection which was between you and your ex∣cellent Brother and know you love his Daughter as your own so as not only to express the Tenderness of the best of Aunts but even supply that of the best of Fathers I am sure it will be a Pleasure to you to hear that she proves worthy of her Father worthy of you and of your and her An∣cestors Her Ingenuity is admirable her Frugality extraordinary She loves me the surest Pledge of her Virtue and adds to this a wonderful Disposition to Learning which she has acquired from her Affection to me She reads my Writings studies them and even gets them by Heart You would smile to see the Concern she is in when I have a Cause to plead and the Joy she shews when it is over She finds Means to have the first News brought her of the Success I meet with in Court how I am heard and what Decree is made If I  recite any Thing in Publick she cannot refrain from placing herself privately in some Corner to hear where with the ut∣most Delight she feasts on my Applauses Sometimes she sings my Verses and accom∣panies them with the  Lute  without any Master except Love the best of Instru∣ctors From these Instances I take the most certain Omens of our perpetual and in∣creasing Happiness since her Affection is not founded on my Youth and Person which must gradually decay but she is in Love with the immutable Part of me my Glory and Reputation Nor indeed could be less expected from One who had the Happiness to receive her Education from you who in your House was accustomed to every Thing that was virtuous and de∣cent and even began to love me by your Recommendation For as you had always the greatest Respect for my Mother you were pleased from my Infancy to form me to commend me and kindly to presage I should be One Day what my Wife fan∣cies I am Accept therefore our united Thanks mine that you have bestowed her on me and hers that you have given me to her as a mutual Grant of Joy and Felicity  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Quod nequeo monstrare sentio tantum  JUVEN  FRIDAY  September    DETRACTORS may be said to lead their Lives in a Habit of most injurious Falshood towards good Men and of the most offensive Impiety to Heaven Persons of this itching and abandoned Appetite may If we consider the numerous Mischiefs they do to human Society be compared to the most ravenous Beasts of Prey with this Difference That as Beasts of Prey do good sometimes in worrying one another these on the con∣trary will not fall upon or devour any thing but what is excellent  WIT Wisdom Beauty good Humour Modesty Valour Integrity in fine all the Virtues and all the Graces which can illustrate any Person of either Sex are as so many tempt∣ing  Spoils  to the savage Slanderer and strong Provocatives to Detraction There is scarce a Man living that has many little infamous Srories more than ordinary privately handed about wirh great Industry from one to ano∣ther in order to depreciate his Character in the World but what will be found upon a close Examination to have merited publick Ap∣plause for some noble Action or other Ex∣amine still farther and it will as certainly be found that  that  noble Action was the very Source of a  secret  Envy and a  private  Hatred which broke out in a Hundred  whisper'd Tra∣ditions  till it spread and inlarged itself into  publick Defamation  THE most unhappy Circumstances which attend the illustrious Sufferers in this Way I reckon to be these That as Persons who seek after Fame the most eagerly do for the most part very plentifully deserve it so they are the most frequently interrupted in the Search and the least able to bear the Trouble of such unwelcome Interruptions No Men are more  Ideally  fond of Glory than such as most  substantially  deserve it this is a pleasant Weakness But then no Men have a quicker Sensibility of unjust Reproaches than those who take Care never to deserve them and this is a sore Frailty which opens through the Bosoms of the Generous and the Innocent a Way to a Thousand unnecessary  HeartAchs  It is Pity it should be so much in the Power of Calumny as Experience shews it is to strike  a Damp upon the most Generous Spirits and throw a Load over an aspiring Mind that is upon the Stretch after Glory But what seems at present the most of all to be regretted is That by the frequent Complaints I have lately received this Vice is as prevailing as it is insupportable  I HAVE a Letter from a Gentleman containing a very lively Description of a Lady whose Charms have been so long drown∣ed in Tears that they are almost worn out and carried away by the wasting Tide of her Sor∣row which she hides but cannot stopHe proceeds to tell me  "That upon Inquiry into the Source of this mighty Woe he finds it arose from Two or Three ambiguous and broken Sentences glancing at her Virtue and Conversation artfully dropp'd by a malicious Woman in the Ear of a Youth of a Jealous Disposition who loved her whom  she  loved who was contracted to her and departed from her on this AccountWhat signifies talking to her of her inno∣cence and telling her that no Mortal liv∣ing credits it but that  one  Jealous young ManAlas it is only  his  not be∣lieving it that must pour Comfort upon her Affliction'Till then she must re∣main as  Inconsolable  as she is  Innocent  "  MY Correspondent goes on to say  "That he had the Curiosity to go and see this De∣tractress He found her as he tells me Old Wrinkled Ugly her Visage of a pale just turning black as with a Mor∣tification  her Conscience he takes to be much of a Complexion with her Face for when he charged her with it she own'd it as some  trifling Mistake  then drawing her Mouth into a scornful Smile to con∣tradict her Words cries out That  she did not mean it as it was taken  When the  fatal  Consequences were press'd upon hershe said  She was sorry  but express'd her Grief so very  unconcernedly  desiring  to be troubled no more about it  since  it was not Actionable  that she might have sate for the Picture of  Envy  's Look when she has just stollen from doing one of her most  precious  Mischiefs"  THIS Correspondent of mine justly mov'd with his own Relation concludes his Letter with warm Expostulations  "Shall GUILT  sin  thus and shall INNOCENCE look  pale  for it is there no RedressYes there isOthers who are out of the Question may and ought to rise up in the Defence of InnocenceLet the PLAIN DEALER says he whenever any Scandal is traced to the Fountainhead but mark the Quarters of the Detractors as Crosses in the Time of the Pestilence are placed upon the Doors of the Deceased and that Method will effectually strike the Tongue of Detraction dumb"  ANOTHER Account has been lately tran∣smitted to me concerning a young Gentle∣man who is said to have numerous good  Qualities and has been divided from the Estimation of his Friend by the as constant as false Insinuations of a worse than once perjured Woman who insists That the young Gentleman betrayed his Friend's Liberty for a BribeThe contrary has been made out and attested to her FaceShe con∣tinues behind his Back to load him with the CalumnyFinding since she began her Evil Reports that they would not take with∣out putting on an Air of Charity and Sanctity she now concludes her Story to Srrangers thus  "He meaning the Person she aims to scandalize is generally allowed to be a good Man an honest ManPretty ge∣nerally indeedBut what is there to be said for Accidents in this WorldThere is nothing wonderfulNothing new under the SunI have so often Occasion to Wonder that I am resolved never to let any Thing for the Future surprize me into a Fit of AdmirationHe is no Lover of Moneythat is certain as some sayBut say they what they will there is such a Prevalence in Bribes no one knows his own Strength till he be tri∣edThere is no trusting any BodyI would not have believed it of him if  EveryBody had not said it  but  What EveryBody says must be true  "  HERE my Correspondent says he asked the Detractress  How EveryBody came to know it  and she immediately boasted That she  was the Discoverer of it to all who heard it at  first Hand  "To what continues he may we properly liken such a dangerous Crea∣ture as this is who puts out false Colours that she may come up safe and rob Virtue unsuspected She can be compared to no∣thing that resembles her so nearly as a  Witch  in one of those fatal Operations where Murder is the Consequence of her Incantations The Detractress molds her Descriptions as the  Witch  does her Waxen Images When the  Witch  has made an End of her Image the bewitch'd Body perishes and where the Detractress ends any of her Descriptions she makes an in∣jur'd Reputation die"  I HAVE other Accounts of the like Sort to all which I shall give an Answer in a future Paper when I shall explain my self at large upon this Head  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Hae nugae seria ducunt  In mala derisum

privately  for that Purpose  SIR  I HAVE been Married about Two Years to a Young Woman that is every Way agreeable to my Temper but only she is given to be a little too Superstitious The Truth is she was determined in her Choice of me by the Prediction of a For∣tuneteller Without thinking myself more oblig'd to him than in good Reason I  should I may safely say without Supersti∣tion that I shall like him for having cau∣sed my good Fortune by foretelling it the longest Day I have to live She would be the bestnatur'd Creature in the World if her Mind was not haunted by Spirits Sto∣ries of which take up most of her Con∣versation by Day and make her waken me a Nights very frequently I laugh'd at these little Tales at first but not being able to get her out of them I indulged her in the relating them which she has conti∣nued to do so prettily that though I know according to right Reason I ought not to be Terrified I am brought to trem∣ble at the tumbling of a SaltsellerIf my Wife could be once cured I am sure I should be well soon afterShe has been for these Three Months last counting our Hours by a Deathwatch and has made me almost sick with Fear that she who so often speaks of her Death should die in good EarnestThis splenetick Cast of her Temper having an Effect on me who sympathize with her in every Thing throws a Gloom over our Hours which would otherwise pass as delightfully as any Couple's upon EarthPray give her some better Reasons than I am able to in∣still into her to fortify her Mind against these little Surprizes of Superstition and you will make her the best Wife in the World who studies to  be  and  is  EASY to me  in every Case but this that she is UNEASY to her ownself  Your most Humble Servant  MARK DOCILE  Mr PLAIN DEALER  YOU have pretended to give Laws about People's Behaviour in Marri∣age and there is no such Thing in Nature to be done I am a Man of the best Hu∣mour in the World or otherwise I could not please my Wife by appearing to be the Worst If I am not angry half a do∣zen Times a Day she will be out of Hu∣mour and not speak to me I found out her Delight and have got many a sweet Kiss for what in another Couple would have gone near to have caused a Divorce She uses a hundred Plots to put me out of Hu∣mour all which encreases my good Nature so much knowing that poor  Molly  falls out for nothing but to make Friends that I sometimes find it  hard  to be  pleas'd  to be  angry  with her I am perhaps the  merri∣est  Man of a  passionate  one that was ever known and my Wife the most  contented  of all  Sufferers  I should weary your Pa∣tience if I was to tell you the different Stratagems by which she almost tires out my good Humour to make me exert it in trying her Patience My Shoemaker has  a Wife as like her as Two  Lasts  But she is more violent in her Cravings insomuch that he is forced to proceed from  Sound  to  Substance  He says she never is a kinder Bedfellow than when she has induc'd him to do her the Kindness to bang her into Bed He adds that he has bound her to him in all Kindness by laying his Strap over her Shoulders almost every Day she lives If he miss it some Days together the poor Thing cries and thinks herself neglected You see what Happiness there is in Matri∣mony And that there are other Rules for Behaviour between Husband and Wife besides those of your Teaching  Yours  BOB MERRYTHOUGHT  SIR  YOU lately gave us so lively a De∣scription of the Races at  Newmarket  that I cannot but wish you would exert your  WoodenHorse  as Men of your Age commonly call their  OakenSticks  and take a Journey from your  WatchTower  of  Bar∣bican  to  Exchange Alley  You will find that the Citizens who have been a long Time injuriously misrepresented as a plod∣ding Generation of People have as  brisk  Imaginations in  their way  as any of the  quickest Wits  that inhabit the  Temple  or  any  courtly  Part of the Town beyond the  Bar  Their  Fancies  run upon  Wheels  but they are  substantial  ones and since the Lot∣tery has been set up they all seem to turn upon that great and important One of  Fortune  They are so clever in their Devi∣ces that they have formed several  Streets  into  Courses  and fix'd a convenient  Mar∣ket  just at hand where a Man may pur∣chase a  Racer  at any Hour of the Day to try his Luck upon and scower away in∣to a large Estate between Sun and Sun In fine the Scene of  Newmarket  is shifted to  London  and  Smithfield  translated into  ExchangeAlley  As ill a Figure as the top Citizens have been said to make on Horse∣back with all their Pageants about them on a  LordMayor's Day  yet to do them Justice now they are become serious in  Horseman∣ship  and have turned Play into a Trade you cannot imagine what  expert Jockies  they make Our NewsPapers have lately diverted us with strange Accounts of  slow  Beasts called  Asses  that have been brought up to be very nimble and of  Cows  turn'd into  Gallopers  for the Sport of our ingeni∣ous Brethren that have  running  Heads in the Country We have very far  overmatch'd  them in Town for we have  Exchange Bears  and  Exchange Bulls  that will mount a  Titt  as  cleverly  as if they were born to it They will purchase you a  Nag  for  Three Half Crowns  and count him but a mere  Jade  if he wins the  Rider less  than a  Thousand Pounds Guildhall  is the Goal they run to and if one of your CityRacers comes in at the Nick as we call it for we run the Twelve Hours by  lucky Minutes  two  Boys  hold up their Hands and bid the Man that has run the  Course  be happy all his Life after I don't doubt but when  Bar∣tholomew  Fair was put to so early a Period you deplored the Accident because lasting a little longer the odd Mirth of the Peo∣ple that frequented it would have fur∣nished you with Materials without going far from your Neighbourhood But this  Bull  and  Bear  Fair in the City will be of long Continuance and make you ample Amends if you will but come and see it When I see the Wheel go round and the Racers are by at the Twirling of it my Imagination re∣presents it to me like the flying Chariots and Machines for young Travellers in  Smith∣field  in which methinks I see an Ap∣prentice seated over the Head of a Com∣monCouncilMan a SuburbHabardash∣er of Small Wares mounted three Stories higher in Fortune than a grave Alderman with a Gold Chain about his Neck and a Semstress more lofty than a Lady Mayo∣ress But I am giving you a Description which I had rather you should come and take I dare say it will make as diverting a Paper at least as the List of the Lot∣tery Tickets and you need not desire a  better Prize than to have yours read by equal Numbers with equal Curiosity Desire and Circumspection I am of the  Mule Kind  in Trade and sometimes  Bellow  in the Alley like a  Bud  upon the  Fall  and sometimes  Dance  like a  Bear  upon the  Rise  of the Stocks You shall be welcome to take a  secure Stand  in in my Den from whence you may see

virum musa vetat mori  HOR  Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae  Intaminatis fulget honoribus  Nec sumet aut ponit secures  Arbitrio popularis aurae  Ibid  FRIDAY  September    THE Estimation of publick Actions seems to me to be unjustly calculated Men derive the  Quality  of Actions from that of the Actor Would it not be more just to measure the Actor by the Action The An∣cients considered the Degrees of Superiority to consist in those of Merit and Virtue  Pliny  has distinguish'd himself by Remarks on this Head in his admirable Epistles and tho' he was at the  Head  of the  Nobles  as well as the  Wits  of his Age he thought it not below him to pay Acknowledgments  nay refined Compliments to the Merit of Persons in low Life but took a worthy Pride in raising them from the Obscurity annexed to that Condition by a  Comparison  with the highest renowned for Deeds which sprang from the same Greatness and Elevati∣on of Spirit As Titles are often but Acci∣dents this is a just Way of Judging since Worth is not the Consequence of a Name but a great Name ought ever to be the Consequence of Virtue  "MODERN Writers" said our  Critick  the other Evening "have gone into a different Turn of Thinking They extol to the Skies the indifferent Actions and palliate the Blemishes of Titled People who disgrace the Figure of Life they ap∣pear in but meanly decline the right Use of Art upon Subjects where they might point out Greatness in obscure Men who were never  little  in any Thing but the  Accident  of their Birth and who  living  and  dying  did an Honour to Human Nature Such Penmen may be called  The Rabble of the Wits  who are dazled by the false Glare of the Great but can look at solid Virtue without the least Emotion or Sign of being able to see it The Stiles of these petty Panegyrists are like their Subjects glittering but not solid swel∣ling but rather empty than great they seem never to have heard of that beautiful  Simplicity which arises out of Nature and forms the Sublime so much admired by the Readers and so masterly executed by the Writers of Antiquity"  WE were led into this Track of Thinking by my looking the other Day into a little Book call'd  The History of the Preservation of  Charles  the Second after the noted Battle of  Worcester which was fought in the Year on the Third of this very Month of  September  I there meet with such a prodigi∣ous Instance of Fidelity and Loyalty in a poor mean Country Fellow nam'd  Pendrell  and all his  Family  that I know not  any  so Illustrious to which my Heart would lead me to pay greater or sincerer Acknowledge∣ments I am not at all surprized to find that this amazing Incident of Integrity is coolly and insensibly treated by Men of slender Abilities who have an Affectation to shine upon more pompous Subjects who chuse rather to spend their Strength in relat∣ing the Fury of that Battle and lay out all their mistaken Eloquence in raising the Pow∣ers of Hell to push on its horrible Conse∣quences but it is both a Matter of Surprize and Confusion to think that so many truly great Poets and Orators should live just af∣ter and leave an Example so beneficial to Posterity in a manner forgotten for want of being commended with that Spirit it so richly deserves  PERHAPS the History of the whole World were we to turn it never so carefully over could furnish us with but few Things more astonishing more moving and pathetick more exemplary and edifying than this un∣celebrated PassageA Monarch to be forced by a prevailing Faction to turn a Fugitive in his own Kingdoms And when discomfited Princes disabled Lords and routed Armies could no longer assist their Sovereign that it should be reserved for a poor simple Hind to preserve this Lord's Anointed from a cruel pursuing Victor whose praeternatural Swells of Fortune made him the Terror of all  Christendom  That it should be reserved for an ignorant Country∣man to save a wise and mighty Prince from falling like his good Father to be after∣wards received as our Glory with the Ap∣plauses and Acclamations not only of our own Three Kingdoms but all the Nations about us And shall this  Englishman  record∣ed with Honour by foreign Writers be only coldly spoken of by our ownIs he a mean Man Consider the noble Trust and the nobler Discharge of it and he grows great in Proportion to the Littleness of his Condition Is he Poor How does that Po∣verty add to the Richness of his Virtue who hears  Praemiums  bid for the precious Life he has in Custody and yet disdaining the Bribe of Gold ventures his own for his Loyalty Sure nothing but a Soul which is abandon'd  to Barbarity and Meanness can let a little Idea of him take Place upon Account of his despicable Figure It is the noblest Addition to his Greatness As inconsiderable as he might be otherwise he must in this View make a fine Picture and he is a living Dis∣grace to that Herd of Titled Criminals who follow'd the Fortunes and partook the im∣pious Greatness of the Pursuer of Majesty Let those who look no farther than the out∣side of Things think a  Plebian  below  Eulo∣gy  I who view him with other Eyes al∣most think him above it Had he lived in more generous Times and been the Preser∣ver of an  Augustus  his honest Contempt of Gold would have justly given him a Place equal with  Camillus  in the  Horatian  Ode consecrated to the Praises of that Emperor  IT is a Scene that the Imagination can∣not entertain without a Mixture of Grief and Admiration when we place before our Eyes that Prince in the Habit of a Rustick amidst so many different Dangers relying upon the Conduct and Fidelity of this  real  Rustick this venerable Clown and his little Family for his Guards I remember to have been informed by a very great Man That  "He has heard the King tell the Story in Jest and wonder'd to see many smile when his Majesty said pleasantly That  He He was once in danger of losing his Guide in the NightTime but that the Rustling of  Richard  's CalvesSkin Breeches was a Dire∣ction  to his Ear in the Dark  The King might indeed make a Jest of it said he but I could not think of Majesty in such Distress without being touch'd in good Earnest by a Grief which it was beyond the Notion of an odd and comical Dress to remove"  I must say the same as this Nobleman with regard to the King and even as to  Pendrell  there is some∣thing too serious in his Integrity not to make us lose his Appearance in our Venera∣tion of his Virtues As there was a Princely Person in one rough Garb there was a noble Soul in the other for when he attended the King for the last Time he shewed he had a true Sense of the Weight of his Charge For his Majesty complaining of the Horse  That it was the heaviest Jade he ever rode on Pendrell  smilingly told him  That the Horse had the Weight of Three Kingdoms on his Back and ought not therefore to be blamed if he went a little heavily  WHEN I Meditate the many Passages that this little History recounts between the King and  Pendrell  my Attention is so fixed to the Parts which exercised this Man's Fi∣delity that I scarce have Room in my Thoughts for the Glories of a Restora∣tion that he was reserved for I love to dwell upon this good Man It is a familiar Example but it is the more useful the Least Man may be faithful and Fidelity will make him Great while the Greatest Man with∣out  Integrity dwindles into a Little oneIt is true also Integrity makes a Great Man much Greater so it is with  Ge∣neral Monk  a Name far beyond his Title Duke of  Albemarle  strikes no Ear calls for no Admiration But Every one admires the  General  and the  Restorer  A LITTLE gentlemanly Estate was after∣wards settled upon his Descendants and had he been advanced by the Pleasure of the King from that lowly Degree to the No∣bility no Lord could have thought himself injur'd by having for his Peer and Compa∣nion the Heir of that worthy Man who preserved the Fountain of Honour  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Fallacia  Alia aliam trudit  TEREN  MONDAY  September    CREDULITY  is a Weakness from which very few are exempted It is the Groundwork of Craft and Imposture and the Means by which they are propa∣gated  I HAVE often reflected with Concern upon the Condition of Humanity in this Regard And nothing can be more afflicting than to behold one Part of the rational World making a  Trade  of misguiding the other If all the Errors into which People are drawn had but the Marks of  Truth  some Excuse might be found for their  Cre∣dulity  but the Shame is in their receiving what is  new  at the Expence even of  Proba∣bability  Vulgar Minds are most struck with what is most incredible and the Way to  convince  is to  amaze  them  Reason  makes few Proselytes But  Mystery  rarely fails And the less they know why the fonder they grow of the Imposture  BECAUSE I would not dip into Contro∣versies wherein  Religion  and  Government  are concern'd I must descend into Low Life and only touch the little Artifices which owe their Reputation to this Weakness  THE World is wearied with Stories of  Witches  and  Fairies  and begins to see thro' the Imposture The Craft of  Astrologers Conjurers  and  Prophets  begins also to be ex∣ploded by the Vulgar whose  Oracles  they have long been But I am not a little amaz'd to find that instead of the Delusions once practis'd on the Multitude They now work strongest among the polite and fashionable People What Staring what Clapping what Waste of Time and Money have  Harlequin  and  Faustus  occasion'd The Madness both of  Actors  and  Spectators  has so provok'd me almost to Tears that I could even have  wept over the City  I WILL not be so partial to our Wor∣shipful Society of FREE  and  ACCEPTED MASONS as to forbear reproving them on this Occasion for the unaccountable Po∣ther and Noise they have lately made in the World What Stories have been told to amuse and engage the  Credulous  What  Reflections what Reproach have they brought upon That ANCIENT ORDER by making Proselytes in so cheap and so prosti∣tuted a Manner It afflicts me sensibly when I see Coxcombs introduc'd into our  Lodges  and made privy to our  Secrets  I have often enter'd my Protest against this Abuse in pri∣vate Society and must use the Freedom to offer this Memorial in my publick Character 'Tis my Opinion That the late Prostitution of our  Order  is in some Measure the betraying it The weak Heads of  Vintners Drawers Wig∣makers Weavers  c admitted into our  Frater∣nity  have not only brought Contempt upon the Institution but do very much endanger it And I have heard it ask'd Why we don't admit  Women  as well as  Taylors  into our  Lodges  I must confess I have met with as  sufficient  Heads among the  Fair Sex  as I have found in the BROTHERHOOD I have some Reasons to fear that our SECRETS are in Danger There is in the Conduct of too many since their Admission the  Caecus amor sui  Et tollens vacuum plus nimio Gloria verticem  Arcanique Fides prodiga perlucidior vitro  which is expresly prohibited by our Excellent RULES and CONSTITUTIONS and which is the very Characteristick of the Fools that were received into the LODGES at  ROME  in the Days of  AUGUSTUS CAESAR    and whereof our Brother  HORACE  com∣plain'd vehemently in an  Ode  to  VARUS  who was then GRAND MASTER But whatever Freedoms others imagine they may lawfully and discreetly use my Conscience cannot brook them  NON EGO TE  INVITUM QUATIAM NEC  SUB DIVUM RAPIAM  MY Female Readers and I'm afraid some of the

leave the Ignorant to their  Wonder  and pro∣ceed to assure my  Brethren  that they have promoted  Superstition and Babbling  contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King by their late Practices and Condescen∣tions Alarming Reports and Stories of LADDERS HALTERS DRAWN SWORDS and DARK ROOMS have spread Confusion and Terror And if the Government does not put the Laws against us in Execution it will be an extraor∣dinary Favour or  Oversight  For my own Part I am so faithful a Subject and have the Weal of  Our Ancient Order  so much at Heart that unless the GRAND MASTER puts a Stop to these Proceedings by a peremptory  Charge to the BROTHERHOOD I wish I cou'd honourably enter into ANOTHER  AND now I have hinted at ANOTHER  Order  I must entertain my Readers with Two Letters

call'd at the  Castle  to be satisfy'd of the Truth of my Arrival in this Place Your Enquiry and the Conversation you had with my Secretary give me Occasion to gratify you farther and I am proud to have it in my Power to distinguish one of your Merit in the Manner I intend  THE  Laws  and  Constitutions  of the most ancient and illustrious  Order  of the  GORMOGONS  oblige us to be  cau∣tious

Prejudice  nor  Partiality  in con∣ferring this Honour and all the  Interest  in the World to procure it would be fruitless without  Merit  MY Residence here will be short It cannot therefore be expected that I shou'd invite many worthy Persons to enter into our  Order  nor dare I render it cheap and contemptible by admitting every Preten∣der But I know several who deserve to be received and to whom I have promis'd the Distinction  I SHALL consider it as an Ornament to our  most ancient  and illustrious ORDER which is the Honour and Ornament of all its Members if you  Sage Sir  will be pleas'd to accept the Privileges that I am empower'd to bestow on the  Deserving  I confess you must first be DEGRADED as our Laws require and renounce and abandon the Society of  FalseBuilders  But as your great Judgment must distin∣guish the Excellence of our  Order  I hope you will prefer being a  Fellow  with  Us  Nothing would more sensibly concern me when I leave  London  than not be able

Correspondents the one from  Edinburgh  the other from  Surrey  who both so beautifully and pathetically pour forth their Complaints to the PLAIN DEALER shall meet with a proper and early Regard  THE ANONYMOUS Gentleman who re∣quests our speedy Opinion of a certain Case which he says is  urgent  is desired to sus∣pend his  dangerous  Advice to his Friend and we shall touch upon that Subject in an am∣pler Manner than is consistent with the Haste he requires  THE PLAIN DEALER No  De tot modo millibus unus  De tot modo millibus una  OVID  FRIDAY  September    THE following Letters sign'd MAECENAS were written as their Dates shew some Time since by a Gentleman from  Lon∣don  to his Friend at  Cambridge  and being full of a generous Spirit we have inserted them according to our Promise in our last  London  December    SIR  WHAT I here write to you is Af∣fection true because spontaneous Affection to a Family who know not me or that I am now writing or intending to write to you or any body concerning them  I AM just now seated at a Coffeehouse not far from the  RoyalExchange  where I am very much affected as I often have been with the genteel humble Deport∣ment of the Barkeeper A Deportment most agreeably adapted to her present Sta∣tionYet at the same time such as betokens a Genius superior to this Way of Livelihood It is known to every body that sees this Gentlewoman seeing her is knowing it that she is a Gentlewoman But that moreover she has  this  additional Merit To have been the Comfort the lov∣ing and beloved Comfort of the great and admirable  Favellus  this perhaps is not so universally known  FAVELLUS  was an eminent Preacher of the Town Those that know his Character can tell 'twas a Compound of all the good Characters belonging to a Christian to a Divine to a Gentleman He had a most extensive Genius which with his own Edu∣cation and Industry made vast Acquire∣ments in all sorts of Theological Literature This will appear to a Man of any Sagacity that makes use of That and his Sermons when publish'd which are now Printing by Subscription The first of these Sermons that was preached in my Hearing gave me a most surprizing Mixture of Pleasure and Concern  Pleasure  in hearing at once a  Demosthenes  and a  Euclid  a  Chrysostom  and a  Bentley    All  met together  All  speak∣ing  in this accomplish'd Divine who was himself a most powerful a most pathetick  Orator  a most exact  Reasoner  a most persua∣sive  Theologer  in one Word  an universal consummate Scholar  This was the  Pleasure  A  Concern  too it gave me a Concern in∣expressible arising from a certain Uneasiness I felt in my own Breast from reflecting that tho' I had been Years in  London  this was but my  First  Pleasure of hearing this inimitable Man After this you may be sure I became his eager Attendant And of All the Sermons I attended Head and Heart say thisThey were All to a Degree that is incredible  All  Edifying All Enter∣taining Entertaining I mean in that Way wherein Theological Performances  may  and  ought  to entertain 'Tis rare  remarkably  rare to meet with the Man that writes or indeed is  capable  of writing in that Close that Mathematical that Concatenating Way he excell'd in or that has the same Sa∣gacity in  Pointing out  the Intricacies of an Argument together with the same Acute∣ness the same Clearness in  Removing  'emputting Prejudice to the Blushre∣conciling Scripture to Scripturemaking Error  appear  to be Error Truth to be Truth You'd be sure not only to be pleas'd but to  exult  in the Pleasure you took if you had heard him frequently as I did ad∣vancing and that so ingeniously some Truths that were uncommon and defend∣ing  common ones in an uncommon Man∣ner making obscure Things plain plain Things  surprizingly  plainerTo raise Objections so  pertinently  to state 'em so  can∣didly  to answer 'em so  unanswerably  is a Talent or rather  many  Talents wherein but few Men if few cou'd come up to him  I ASK now Shou'd it not be Matter of  Wonder  to ALL Men and to Men of Merit  Concern  that this very Man a Man of their own Number a Minister of the Gos∣pel too an  eminent  Minister an eminent WriterGreat in LearningGreat in GoodnessGreat in RenownOf a meek humble winning DispositionOf a sweet sober edifying ConversationOf a blameless of an unspotted Cha∣racterWithal too a Man of strict  Or∣thodoxy  and is not  This  alone a Thousand good CharactersI say shou'd it not even in Point of  Humanity  much more so of  Charity  affect  All  Men  of Merit  or that  love  Merit to observe how it pass'd unrewarded slighted discourag'd tho' seen plainly tho' admir'd universally in this excellent Man  THINKand grieve when you think how he Died How Indigent How  exceed∣ingly  Indigentand this after a Life wherein there was nothing of Excessex∣cept that of its being painful  willingly  pain∣ful to  Himself  and that purposely that it might be useful to  Others  BEHOLD him  when Living  living blamelessly in every Thing  Blamelessly  did I say It had been just to have said  Admirably  in every Thing Admirably every where  At Home  Studious at Home Frugal in all his Oeconomy  Abroad  sel∣domexcept at his Church  At Church  attended with a full Congregation perhaps the fullest in this great City wherein were Persons of almost all Denominations all all Ranks and Perswasions all pleas'd all  greedy  to hear this incomparable ManAnd yet  BEHOLD him  when Dying  not worth enough to defray the Charge of his Funeral  Now  it appears thro' his own singular Modesty it did not  till now  What a poor Livelihood Wonder and be astonish'd and yet this was  All  his Livelihood for himself and Family he got by the Mini∣stry Poor so deplorably poor that his di∣stress'd Widow and Two or Three young lovely Children at least  some  of 'em are likely e'er long O pity pity even toI  cannot  speak itWhat shall I sayMy Heart bleeds when I think of it He died as I'm told not worth Ten Shillings  WITHIN the Circle of your Acquain∣tance and my own there are  some  no doubt that have Inclinations but want  Abilities  to be Beneficent some that have Abilities but want Inclinations Some  that have  Both  and would imploy both but know not  where  to employ 'em To these last sort of Persons to all these ablewellin∣clining Persons namely to all that have  no Heirs  of their own to inherit after them or have more Riches than enough for their Heirs and for such like Reasons have gene∣rous Design I say To  these  surely I need not say more  PITY even common Pity mov'd me thus to throw in a Word or two I hope at least 'twill have  some  favourable Conse∣quence in Favour of this unhappy Widow and Children the Melancholy Remains of that Learned Good Man I have been speak∣ing of and the this rather because as you see they are now reduc'd for the Sake of a Subsistence to the Business of a Coffeehouse  THE Widow's Demeanor in this new Way of Life as I told you  genteel  Humility sub∣missive easy chearful in this the Station allotted her  Because  'tis allotted her She has this Character in all its Beauty and Elegance in all the Nicety and Goodbreed∣ing belonging to it See the  Whole  of her Conduct See in that the  worst  of Adver∣sities in its best Dress Whoever attends to it and whoever beholds  cannot but  attend to it has a very  instructive  Amusement There is scarce an Action she does that in this Way is not an excellent Document being itself a Comment on that polite Humility I am speaking of To see her just now bring∣ing  me the Dish of Coffee I call'd for with HER  peculiar  Way of doing it is an admir∣able Criticism on those Words of St  Paul I know HOW to be abased  And to attend her saying  Sir I thank you  and her  Man∣ner  of saying it with the Curt'sy an∣nex'd to a Gentleman that a while ago laid his Penny at the Bar is perhaps a bet∣ter Sermon than many a Divine cou'd have made on this Text of St  Peter    Be Courteous  So much for the Widow  THE Children poor fatherless undone Children seem to carry an Hereditary Goodness in their very Aspects It wou'd melt  any  Heart to behold them any es∣pecially that remembers that worthy Fa∣ther they descended from  SIR Sure you are affected with this Me∣lancholy Narrative 'Tis Truth Inquire and you'll find it  All  to be Truth as related to you by  Your most Affected  MAECENAS  London  May    Dear SIR  IN my last I griev'd in this I rejoice as you will when I tell you that the distress'd Widow of the late Reverend and Excellent  Favellus  is lately Married to a Good Man and an ample Estate ample  enough to provide handsomly for her and her Children Behold the Benevolence be∣hold the Goodness the Superlative Good∣ness of  Amasius  that has thought fit to be∣stow Himself and his All and this with∣out Hurt to any Relation of his own I esteem I admire the Man 'tho I know him not I'm all Joy and Transport and impatient to tell it you I can write nothing elsetherefore conclude in an Extasy  Yours  MAECENAS  Sept    SIR  'TIS the Opinion of me and of many that the two Letters I inclose may pass with Advantage thro' your Hands to the Publick If too long abridge 'em as you think fit I was at  Cambridge  when I reciv'd both from  Maecenas  who I must tell you is a Gentleman of the  Temple  that won't permit me to say more of him nor need I to a Person of  your  Taste and Dis∣cernment that can read the Soul of a Man in his Letters  BE just Sir to such a remarkable Piece of Generosity as this of  Amasius  and con∣vince the World that it is not only an un∣common  Generosity  but an uncommon  good Sense  a good Sense perhaps which a  great many  foolish  People have not a  Notion of  and which a great many wise ones have  only  a Notion of  THE like Conduct to this of  Amasius  was t'other Day that of  THEODOSIA  a Lady of an amiable Character and of a very con∣siderable Family and Fortune She has had a long and intimate Knowledge of  Honestus  and of All his Good Qualities She has of∣ten heard often seen what a kind Hus∣band he made to his Wise whom he has lately lost and with her an Estate that was all he had to subsist upon He had met with many Adversities many Trials before But this was the greatest He bore it man∣fully hoping trusting resting firmly and chearfully in an Almighty Wisdom Goodness and Providence With this Re∣solution he made a friendly Visit to his Ac∣quaintance in the Country among the rest to  Theodosia  who receiv'd him kindly and pity'd him He there fell ill of a Fever during which she gave him a Thousand Proofs of her Tenderness and after he had recover'd added this to the Number of 'em  She Married him  Not without the Ad∣vice of her best Friends and Relations  THIS is the Character of  Honestus  a great deal of  Merit  but withal a great deal of  Poverty  and  Four Children  along with it For  this  she's reflected on Cruel World thus to treat the generous  Theodosia  And thus to treat her  because  she is generous  Cruelty itself But incourage her I beseech you Sir and let it be  your  Gene∣rosity to say all you can in behalf of  Theo∣dosia  's  HEREBY if speedy you'll oblige many besides  SIR  Your Sincere Friend And Humble Servant  PHILANTHROPOS  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Trahimur omnes laudis studio optimus quis{que} maxime gloria ducitur  CICERO  MONDAY  September    WE regard not Rivals in  Love  with more Malice than Rivals in  Fame  And the softer Sex is most liable to the ma∣lignant Impressions of Envy because their Pursuits being fewer than ours their Appli∣cation is more  intense  and  collected  And they brook Disappointments with less Comfort and Moderation  WIT  and  Beauty  are the Arms they conquer by It is with Jealousy therefore that they behold them in any Hands but their own The Praise of one Lady is con∣sidered by another as a Reproach And  her  Soul must be sublimely Great who not on∣ly observes with Pleasure the Fame and In∣fluence of a powerful Rival but contri∣butes her own Endeavours to the Support and Increase of them  I HAVE been led into these Reflections by the Delight with which I perus'd the following Letter and Copy of Verses which were lately sent me by a Lady who has either too much Generosity to malign the Excellence and Applause of others Or too large a Share of both herself to be al∣larm'd at their Advance in either  SIR  I HAVE found That your Paper has a Power to move the Soul and holds a Command over the Passions Your PLAIN DEALER on  Death  is one con∣tinued Beauty He ought methinks to  live  for ever who can make  Death  so de∣sirable While I was reading in it all Vanity and Love of Life forsook meMy Eyes resign'd themselves to Tears and I even seem'd to  feel  the Grave The beautiful Verse glided through my Veins and I trembled with a  pleasing Horror  WHILE my Mind was thus delight∣fully sadden'd Death depriv'd me of a  perfect Friend  to whose dear Memory I have devoted the Lines inclos'd They have little Beauty but the Truth and Passion of my Concern Perhaps  That  will plead their Pardon  THE Lady whose Loss I lament was an Ornament to one Sex and the Re∣proach and Admiration of the other I wonder a Death so considerable appears so little deplor'dWhere is  Friendship  Was it buried in  Delia  's Grave Let me invoke it to lament her  She  who cou'd so gracefully  mourn  let  us  mourn  her  She who cou'd give  Life  to our Imagination let us be sorry for her  Death  and assist her Fame by our Gratitude  YOU  Sir who know how to Charm your Readers as you please I wish you would chuse this inspiring Subject of  Friend∣ship  Its divine Spirit is too much confin'd among Persons of narrow NaturesAs for me I am not insensible of it I feel its Power at my Heart but can't do Justice in expressing itThe Descent to  Age  and  Affliction  is smooth'd and sof∣ten'd by the Aid of  Friendship  It rebates the Edge of sharpest Miseries We seem  not to grow Old  when we have a  Friend  to make Life tasteful to us Time flies over us indeed but he seems to brush us with downy Wings and marks his Way with slight Impressions  WHEN I see a Face more serene or more lovely than usual I take Pleasure to imagine she owes her Sweetness to the Influence of some charming Friend's Society The Soul is quicken'd in its Energy by the Power of so divine a Soft∣ness nor shares nor laments the  Body  's Miseries  EXCUSE the Fullness of my Heart on this favourite Subject And I will be frank enough to own that I am sometimes blest with a Friend of  your  Sex too And while I have the Joy of listening to his Wisdom methinks we have already pass'd the  Grave  and are enjoying the De∣lights of  Heaven  I am SIR Your most Respectful Humble Servant  CLEORA  VERSES Written by a LADY On the Death of Mrs MANLEY  PALE bleeding Friendship and distracted Grief  Leave me no  Voice  to give my Woe Relief  Ev'n the soft Gratitude my  Eyes  should pay  Flows from my  Soul  and speaks this nobler Way  My weeping Pen shall my Distress impart  And its  dark Tears  dissolve the Reader's Heart  Till  Tears on Tears  in social Grief descend  And the  World mourns  my Soul's lamented Friend  Yet does my Muse but a  brib'd  Off'ring give  Since join'd to Thine  My  Name is  sure to live  Why wert Thou ravish'd from my Love so soon  Why gleam'd thy  Evening only  on  my Noon  Had thy dear Friendship warm'd my  Morning  Lays  I had  deserv'd  the Glory of thy Praise  Sprung lively forward lighten'd by thy Ray  Chear'd for the Race and  darted into Day  But thou wert held from my desiring Sight  And my Muse  wander'd  distant from  Thy Light  How strong yet soft was Her accomplish'd Mind  Sincere like Heaven and as its Angels kind  Safe as the  Sun  in her Superior Rays  How  full  shone  Merit  in her graceful Praise  Such active  Flame  did her warm Fancy give  That ev'ry glowing  Letter  seem'd to  live  Where's now th' unconscious Heart that cou'd descend  To bless my Wishes with the Name of  Friend  Senceless and cold 'twill now no longer move  At  Pity's  tender Voice or weeping  Love  Where shall we now those bright  Ideas  find  That  peopled Thought  from thy creating Mind  Death  has  turn'd back  the intercepted Store  But thy  Fame lives  and thou  can'st die no more  Such  Immortality  Thy Friendship  gave  For none whom  Delia sung  can fear the Grave  Life  of my  Genius  whither art thou flown  To what new Regions to my Soul unknown  Let me  o'ertake  theefor I weary grow  And  sicken  at the World that's  left below  The Sunless World where Friendship has no Part  Is cold and dead to my  bewinter'd  Heart  In Life's vain Joys no Comfort can be found  No Cure for  Mem'ry's  eversmarting Wound  When the bright Traces of thy Mind I read  Oh how will  waking Recollection  bleed  Thy Angel Pen  aw'd  ev'n unblushing Vice  And chas'd  high Guilt  from its  proud Paradise  But  Innocence  and  Vertue  were thy  Care  Thy tow'ring Genius shone Triumphant  there  Oh  Delia  tuneful Mistress of my Mind  Dear to my Friendship to my Errors kind  Where shall my Muse  another Delia  find  What  wish'd Intreaties  did I still  receive  Such the  true Great  alone have  Soul to give  While in immortal Honours  she  was dress'd  She stoop'd to raise me to her gen'rous Breast  And  woo'd  my distant Merit  to be blest  I  grasp  thy  Tomb  nor wou'd I thence depart  The World has now no Charm that tempts my Heart  Dark let me sigh to thy departed Shade  Nor  Light  intruding solemn  Grief  invade  My trembling Arms wou'd this cold Marble  bind  Till my lost  Body  joins my  buried Mind  I AM charm'd almost equally with the  Verse  and  Prose  of this LadyThere is in her  Stile  a peculiar  Mark  or  Mole  which her  Minerva  may be known by It is a cer∣tain majestick Shortness in her Periods im∣pregnated  with Sense and Fullness And her  Poetry  is so rich in Beauties that her  Eyes  have scarce more  Fire  or her  Mind  more Scope and Sweetness  IT has often been observ'd That the Ladies of this Island are the most  beautiful  in the Universe I shall endeavour for my Coun∣try's Honour to prove them also the most  Witty  And that they are most  Wise  we are under a Political Necessity of maintain∣ing because no Remark is more obvious to Foreigners than that the Superiority of our Women's Talents has almost universally pre∣ferr'd the Sex in this happy Corner of the World to a Right of Governing their Hus∣bands  BUT when I come to speak of the  Wit  of our  English  Ladies I will not do 'em the Injustice of comparing them with our Male PoetsThere was a  Corinna  among the Antients who carried away the Prize of Poetry from the Immortal  Pindar  himselfTo write better than the  Men  therefore is a Triumph below the Genius of some of our Female Wits whom I could name since other Women have been already  so far  Con∣querors in other Nations But if I match our modern Muses against the  Sappho  's and  Corinna's  of Antiquity and they shall be victorious over those fam'd Victors That indeed will be a Glory  I SHALL consecrate Three future Papers to the Great and different Excellence of Three  English  Ladies who are all now living And whose Writings shall be tryed in a most impartial Comparison with the finest and most celebrated Remnants of Female Genius which have been preserv'd and wonder'd at through a Length of applauding AgesAnd I doubt not but I shall make it demonstrable in those Three Papers that the  English  Ladies have excell'd the Antients in the  Depth  the  Tenderness  and the  Subli∣mity  of their Compositions  THE PLAIN DEALER No  Cur ego si nequeo ignoroque Poeta salutor  HOR  FRIDAY  September    IN a CoffeeRoom the other Day where the Conversation turn'd on Wit a Gen∣tleman was taking Pains to draw an odd kind of Demonstration from the List of Subscrib∣ers to Mr  Pope  's  Translation of Homer  That there never was an Age so favourable to Poets  as  This  And That from the Num∣ber of our  Noble Patrons  the Glorious Reign of King  George  will shine brighter to Posterity than the Reign of  Augustus Caesar  THOUGH I love Loyalty at my Heart and am as conscious as I ought to be of the Influences of His Majesty's Glory yet I confess I was a little startled at the No∣velty of this Assertion and express'd my Surprize with some EmotionI find then cry'd I that I have lived in profound IgnoranceAs for the  Politicks  indeed of the present Age I have always consider'd 'em as too  remarkable  to be soon  forgot  But for the  Wit  of it I was in Hopes there cou'd be no Danger of its being  remem∣ber'd  IT seems continued I the severest Misery of Men of Learning that Custom has mis∣led them to depend for their Encouragment on those  Great  Little Creatures whom we call  People of Quality  Were Wisdom the Consequence of Riches Rank and Power it had been prudent and reasonable for Merit in Distress to apply itself to the  Mighty  But since the Flattery and Indul∣gence in which Those called  Great Men  are educated must give Liberty to their  Passions  and Restraint to their  Intellects  for Under∣standing is scarce necessary to Men who can pay others to think for them therefore with due Regard to a few shining Excepti∣ons a Lord is  above Wit  And most of 'em  wou'd have found it more to their Taste and their Talent to subscribe to  Heidegger  than to  Homer  but that the numerous Ac∣quaintance of this fine and happy Genius united themselves so powerfully to recom∣mend his Translation that to be out of the List was to be out of the  Fashion  which Misfortune no Doubt it was well worth  Six Guineas  to be delivered from the Disgrace of But let me see these shining Names to Mr  Dennis  's  Miscellaneous Tracts  which he is now publishing by a Subscription scarce the Sixth Part so chargeable and I will afterwards suppose that They can  read  as well as  purchase  This however is what I know them too well to expect at their Hands unless Mr  Dennis  shall become as much  The Mode  as Mr  Pope  is  I WAS surpriz'd to observe that at my Mention of Mr  Dennis  almost every Person present join'd in a Clamour against  Criticks  They affirm'd  Thus it was but just to neglect the Writings of a Person who only writes to censure Others  And  That the World shou'd without Regard to a Critick's Learning declare War against his Malice and treat and con∣sider him as a King of Common Enemy  I CONTENTED myself with smiling at the Extravagance of this Reasoning and re∣ply'd That I doubted hot however but the Name of Mr  Pope  would be found a∣mong Mr  Dennis  's  Subscribers  because He has  Soul  to know That though Living Merit  may sometimes as in his own Case be po∣pular yet Popularity is so far from being the  Mark  of Living Merit that Real Excellence for the most Part both  wants  and  disdains  it  IN the Progress of my Papers I am de∣termined to examine into the Foundation of this silly Notion  That Criticks are Enemies to Wit and Learning  And I dare be positive beforehand that I shall discover it to take its Rise from a Cause of the same Nature with that which makes the  Pickpocket  hate the  Horsepond  TO pretend a Love of Learning and at the same Time io dispise Criticism is as ri∣diculous an Absurdity as to delight in noble Buildings and exclaim against ArchitectureIf there is not some  Rule  whereby we are to measure  Wit  then Wit has no Depen∣dance on the Reason and the Judgment and to be a  Wit  or a  Fool  are in that Case Terms SynonimousBut if Wit is to be judg'd by the Examination of our Reason then that Reason is  Criticism  And he who is a Critick is the Champion of Wit and defends it from ProphanationHow can he therefore be the  Enemy  of what is supported by his Influence  THE true Friends of Learning ought to be cautious how they give up  Criticks  lest to free themselves from a present Fear they destroy their future Hope and fall into Ob∣livion under the Growth of assuming Igno∣rance  Like the Degenerate  Roman  Armies who slackening the Severity of their old mar∣tial Discipline came at length says  Proco∣pius  to think Helmets and Corslets too  hot  for themThey were cumbersome and in∣supportableThey  fainted  under the  Weight  of 'emAnd had Courage enough they were sure to fight as successfully without 'emThey tried it And the Consequence was They were never from that Time forward able to stand against the  Arrows  of the overnumbering  Goths  and  Vandals  So depriv'd of their Defence they lost their Empire to  Barbarians  BUT since no Truth operates so power∣fully as that which convinces by Example let the Good or Ill of Criticism be decided in fair Combat between the Gentleman I have nam'd above who professes and forms himself on it and one of our most rapid and voluminous Compilers of Poetry who tho' one wou'd imagine him too  heavy  to  ride Post  yet trusting wholly to Inspiration breaks over Hedges and Ditches and never checks his Horse's  Speed  whether  out  of the Road or  in  it  THIS  Merchant Adventurer  was for en∣grossing Trade to Himself And began with firing the Magazines of Those who dealt in the same CommodityOne of his first  witty Performances  was A  Satire against Wit  An Accident befell me the other Day that may furnish him with Matter of Specu∣lation  I am very fond of a  Cat  And ever since I lodg'd in  Barbican  have delight∣ed in the Society of a Tabby Favourite of my Landlady's Children But it happen'd a few Days since that not being in a Hu∣mour to be so familiar with her as usual she open'd one of her Claws and was pleas'd to scratch my Leg with no small Freedom and Impertinence Upon which in great Wrath I took her up by the Tail and toss'd her out of WindowThe Cat got no Harm but I have quite lost her Heart upon it And  now  I may call coax and tempt her as much as I please she keeps always out out of my Reach And I dare be positive I shall never  catch  her though I were to  live and die in Barbican  BUT to go on with what I propos'dAfter his  Satire against Wit  he set forth  his Wit against Satire  and publish'd an  Epic Poem  call'd PRINCE ARTHURThe Excellent Critick abovenam'd saw upon perusing this Piece that the Gentleman wanted Skill and Application in the Art he was bent on practising He put himself there∣fore to the Trouble of composing for his Use a just and generous Reprehension which he intitled  Remarks upon Prince Arthur  Had the Author been either humble or wise enough to make Advantage by it This wou'd have serv'd him as a Plan to build stronger for the future and given a Turn to his Re∣flexion that might have made him him  what he had so earnest a Desire to pass for  BUT it was then as it is now the Cus∣tom to despise a Critick And the Author of  Prince Arthur  fell so couragiously into the Fashion that in almost His CoachLoad of  Epic Poems  which he has since oblig'd the World with from  Arthur  down to  Al∣fred  I speak it without Compliment The same distinguishable Purity Fire Elegance Fancy Copiousness and Elevation shine alike in every one of 'em And All are equally secure as well from Criticism as Imitation  BUT not content with raising and adorn∣ing  Human  Nature He aspir'd at last to write upon  Divinity Itself  The Great Almighty and His  Works  were now to be the Subject of his practis'd PanegyrickHere sure if ever He was to guard himself with Caution and put on the Critick's Armour  Creation  opened to him with its boundless LustreWorlds beyond Worlds were to be discover'd by his Poetic Telescope And  other Suns  whose  Light  tho' swift enough to travel a Hundred and Fourscore thousand Miles in one  Second  of Time is notwithstanding spent and lost in unconceivable Immensity before it reaches  This  our own  Sun  's Confines  This Light  was to be  more Illuminated  by His Muse and shine down upon his Reader's Fancy  HERE the admirable Critick his old Friend had Himself set an Example such as can never be too much applaudedThe noblest the most extensive the most astonishing Ideas which can expand the Hu∣man Soul had inrich'd his powerful Concep∣tion And one wou'd have hop'd that Mr  Dennis  had made it impossible for any future Writer to treat this Subject in a mean and groveling Manner after he had oblig'd the World so nobly in his  Paraphrase on Te Deum  with Verse and Sentiments sub∣limely suited to the  Vastness  of the Occasion  Wheree'er at utmost Stretch we cast our Eyes  Thro' the vast  frightful  Spaces of the  Skies  Ev'n there we find  Thy Glory  There we gaze  On Thy bright Majesty's  unbounded Blaze  Ten Thousand  Suns  prodigious  Globes  of Light  At once in broad Dimensions strike our Sight  Millions behind  in the remoter Skies  Appear but  Spangles  to our wearied Eyes  And when those wearied Eyes want farther Strength  To pierce the  Void's  unmeasurable Length  Our tow'ring  Thoughts  more vig'rous  farther  fly  And still  remoter  flaming  Worlds  discry  But ev'n an  Angel  's comprehensive  Thought  Cannot  extend  so far as Thou hast  wrought  Our vast Conception to such  Swelling  brought  Swallow'd in  Infinite  is  lost  in  Nought  THIS is Poetry that defies Censure and is rais'd even above Praise for it is scarce pos∣sible to say so much of it as it truly deservesBut now behold on the opposite Side an Abstract from the Muse of  Prince Arthur  in his  Hymn to the Creator  Hail  King Supreme  Of  Power  immense Abyss  Father of  Light  Exhaustless Source of Bliss  Thou Uncreated Selfexistent  Cause  Controul'd by  no Superior  Being's Laws  THE first Three Lines being truly poetical what Pity that the Author's Pride depriv'd him of the Use of  Criticism  Had he  buoy'd  himself by the Help of  That  He cou'd ne∣ver though he had Sir  John Falstaff  's  Alacrity in Sinking  have sunk so soon and so shame∣fully as to tell us in the th VerseThat  He who is Supreme in Power is controul'd by no Superior  ABOUT Lines after this God goes out with a Pair of Compasses to mark the Limits of the World Not that the Poet had any Design they should be made use of but Mr  Milton  had described  Compasses  upon this very Occasion And our Author was resolv'd to be up with him  Thro' the black Bosom of the empty Space  The Gulph confess th'  Omnipotent Embrace    And  pregnant  grown with Elemental  Seed  Unfinish'd Orbs and Worlds in Embryo breed  TO suspend a short Remark on the mani∣fest Contradiction of these two IdeasThe  Drawing out with a Pair of Compasses  And the  Begetting  by  Embraces  I challenge the whole Tribe of CritickHaters throughout  Europe  to match this last Image with any thing so indecent so improper so illexpress'd and indeed so almost blasphe∣mous and extravgant  BUT that no Cause of Complaint may disturb the Lovers of  Variety  whoever likes not one Image shall have a Dozen new ones to make Choice ofThe Author to do him Justice is no Niggard of his Fancy We are all kindly welcome to it as far as it will go And He that desires more is too unreasonable in all Conscience  From the Crude Mass th' Omniscient  Architect  For ev'ry Part  Materials did select    And with a Master Hand the  World erect  Labour'd  by  him  c  By His  cementing  Words the Parts cohere  And  rolls  by His  impulsive Nod  in Air  I AM sorry I have not Room to entertain my Reader with the whole but  we may mea∣sure  Hercules  by his Foot  One of your creeping narrow Genius's Creatures who stand in Awe of the  Criticks  wou'd never have been capable of half this luxuriant Fullness nay They might have been silly enough to suppose it blameable By which  pusilanimous  Fear  of theirs the Reader must have

Est modus in rebus sunt certi denique fines  Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum  HOR  MONDAY  September    THE following Letter from the Gen∣tleman who oblig'd me with a for∣mer from  Edinburgh  will speak so excel∣lently for  Itself  that the kindest Thing I can do for my Reader will be to say no∣thing concerning it which may detain him from the Pleasure of perusing it  Edinburgh  Sept  the th  SIR  YOUR Paper of  Friday  the th of  August  is arrived in  NorthBritain  and has occasioned much Speculation but all its Readers are sensibly obliged by the  Respect you have shewn our Country and for the Honour you have done the rising Generation of both Sexes and I believe there is none here who would not heartily join their Acknowledgements with mine on this Occasion I may therefore presume to thank you in the Name of all my Country∣men who may not use the Freedom to write to you But the Gentlemen of the  Grotesque Club  whom you have so remark∣ably distinguish'd must represent their Sentiments in a better Manner than I can and I will not pretend to speak their Sense or anticipate their Gratitude  GIVE me Leave SIR only to express my Mind in the Sequel You have brought me under strong Obligations to you by the Notice you have taken of my Letter And since you seem to promise to yourself and the World some Intelligence from this Quarter by means of my propos'd Correspondence I cannot but use my En∣deavours to answer in some Measure your Expectations You have fix'd me SIR in the Character of your  Northern Spy  and you may depend upon my most watchful Fidelity  EDINBURGH  being our  Metropolis  and the Place of my Residence must be the chief Scene of Action and the Date of your Intelligence from  NorthBritain  Here is a vast Variety of Humours Cu∣stoms Manners and Conversation to be  considered Many Things happen in this Place that are worthy your Knowledge as a PLAINDEALER Some deserve Praise and Admiration others Displeasure and Reprehension both Regards may be use∣ful either as Examples provoking Emula∣tion or as Reasons warning from Dan∣ger And sure your Judgment SIR cannot err in the Improvement and Ap∣plication of any Accounts I send you  I BEG leave to lay before you several of the Advantages and Disadvantages of our good Town before I descend to Private Life  WE are blest with an able and active  Magistracy  Most of Those intrusted with with the Superintendency of the City are Gentlemen of Breeding and Letters and all have a Bent of Mind that favours the Publick Grandeur and Emolument It seems to be the united Ambition of our Magistrates to adorn the Place and by rendring it more beautiful and commodious to invite new Inhabitants to increase its Treasure and Revenue They would surmount all the Difficulties it labours under by a Superio∣rity of Genius And as they appear true Friends to the Publick Interest in respect of  Trade  they are not wanting in giving Countenance and Encouragement to  Arts  and  Sciences  Politeness thrives under their Influence and some of them set an Ex∣ample of it to the Youth in their own  Practice and Behaviour Here SIR are few cloudy heavyheaded Aldermen whose Length of Wigs and Gowns is their sole Mark of Dignity You would take our  Provosts  for First Ministers and our  Bailies  for Courtiers I have seen  Statesmen  make a worse Figure than our  Deacons  and heard as good Speeches in the  TownCouncil  at  Edinburgh  as at the CouncilBoard of  GreatBritain  I wish all our  Peers  had Abilities equal to some of our  Weavers  and that every  Clergyman  had half the Grace of some  BonnetMakers  of our City  BUT SIR you know there is no  BodyPolitick  perfect many Things are wanting to make our City more flourishing and fam'd And perhaps the greatest Misfortune we labour under is Faction and Party This SIR discourages many noble Purposes and baffles glorious Undertakings SelfLove Pride and Ambition prevail every∣where and sway all Men more or less These are natural to all Creatures The Oldest Cock is Lord of the Roost and the strongest Bull is  Grand Seignior  in his green  Seraglio  the eldest Buck is Tyrant of the Park and from his Strength and his Horns claims a Right to be Chief in Power and no doubt but every individual Crea∣ture of every Species with the same Force would seek and exercise the same Jurisdict∣ion But Men are remarkably distinguished  by their Love of Precedency and often add to their natural Desire of Governing a certain lowspirited Spleen and Malice Our worthy Magistrates meet with more Opposition and Discouragment from little Pretenders to their Place and Authority than from any other Cause If the TownCouncil beholds not  Macro  with the same Partiality with which he considers himself he wonders at their Blindness and grows  peevish  upon it for the Root of the Spleen is often  Pride disappointed  Some carry it farther than mere  Envy  by labouring to undermine and depose those who are above them and commonly the greater the Merit is the more obnoxious to Illwill and Re∣proaches As the  Red Dragon  pursued the Woman in the  Revelation  Faction or Pri∣vate Malice pursues the most deserving Man and when it cannot overtake him it opens its Mouth and  throws a Flood after him  People who have not Merit to rise themselves would at least level others And what has often been my greatest Won∣der in this Case is that most of our little Jars are created and carried on by our  Clergy  PriestCraft is here as  Infallible  as it is at  Rome  and our  Popes  are as  abso∣lute  to the full Extent of their  Parishes  For my own Part I have neither Personal Partiality for any of the present Magistrates nor Prejudice against their Adversaries I never had nor ever needed the Favour of any  of them I speak my Sense freely and it is the Result of just Reflexion and Ob∣servation And I heartily wish I had not such Ground to expose the Spirits of any of my Neighbours to the  PlainDealer  But what a Pity is it that Faction should deface the Publick Good And how vile to plot the Downfal or calumniate the Fame of Those whose Power is their Coun∣try's Blessing  MY Concern for the Place of my Birth has carried me farther than I ought to have allow'd myself Liberty but as I am not to touch this Subject again you will have the Goodness to excuse what I judg'd in some respects to be requisite  I SHOULD not neglect giving you an Account of the State of  Trade  in this Place nor ought I to pass over in Silence the  University  and  College  of  Justices  Many of the  Clergy  too deserve their Praises and must upon some Occasions come under Consideration But being unwilling to tire your Patience and huddle my Materials too much together I will conclude this Letter when I have acquainted you with what the  Ladies  would have  most known  and what every Body here would be glad to have your Opinion of I mean The FAIR ASSEMBLY This SIR consists of our bestbred Ladies of different Qualities and Ages 'Tis but a late Institution and at first was thought to be a proper Theme  for our  Pastors Sunday  Sermons all our Pulpits rail'd against it as they did of Old against  Perukes  and  Tobacco  But the holy Fire is now much spent and we are at Liberty to meet in our great Hall without Danger of the  Kirk  's  Anathema  nay some of the Wives and Daughters of the  Sanctified  begin of late to grace our Fellowship For my own Part I despair not to see the  Reverend  themselves eating Sweatmeats in our Company And mixing innocently in our Country Dances And I own notwithstanding they are worthy Ladies of undisputed Virtue and Honour who preside over the  Fair Assembly  I should be better pleased to see at our Head a  Moderator  from the  General One  Slander and Detraction would fly before him and innocent Freedom and Christian Commu∣nion wou'd be cherished by his Influence Husbands would allow their Wives to go into Company without Jealousy and Parants send their Daughters without fear of their leaving behind them any thing that they ought to bring back again But till that  Halcyon  Day arrives we must be contented with the want of  Sanction  and dance and drink Tea without them I shall say more of our  Fair Assembly  hereafter and at pre∣sent only subscribe myself  Sage  SIR  Your Trusty Spy And Humble Servant  FERGUS BRUCE  THE PLAIN DEALER N  o    Virtutem incolumem odimus  Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi  HOR  FRIDAY  October    To the  Author  of the  PLAINDEALER  Sept    SIR  I RETURN you Thanks for the Pleasure which I have received from several of your  Plain Dealers  and particularly from that which you lately published concerning  Detraction  which could never have obliged the World at a more seasonable Juncture because as you justly observe Slander was never so prevailing as 'tis at present and never so insupportable  DETRACTION  or  Slander  or  Calumny  call it by what Name you please is for the most part begot by  Knaves  and nou∣rish'd and maintain'd by  Fools  and the  more Fools and Knaves there are in a Nation the more must Slander flourish in it but the more corrupt and degenerate a Nation grows the more Fools and Knaves must abound in it Now whether this Nation was ever so corrupt and degenerate as it is at present I leave to others to de∣termine  THE Fools and Knaves of either Sex have a natural Aversion to  Merit  and when they are neither able nor willing to reach a Height to which others more befriended by Nature and more beloved by Heaven have attained they constantly endeavour with all their Might to bring the envied Object down to their own Pitch And the more extraordinary the  Merit  is the greater is the  Envy  and the stronger the Efforts which it makes to blacken the Deserving Which has occasioned a famous Observer of Mankind to say That when∣ever he  hears  a great deal of  Ill  said of any one and sees none at all in him he be∣gins to suspect that  That  Person has a troublesome and offensive  Merit  which eclipses that of others  AS soon as a Knave has invented a Slander a Fool cries out  There must be something in itThere is no Smoak  with∣out  Fire  Which is as much as to say that there can be no such Thing as  Slander  or that no Slander can be  propagated  which is equally contrary to common Sense and  to constant Matter of FactHow different an Opinion of this Matter had the judicious and penetrating  La Bruyere  who tells us That  the Reverse of what is commonly reported concerning Persons or Things is what may reasonably be believ'd of either  THERE is another musty Proverb made use of in the Propagation of  Slander  which is mention'd in your last Paper  viz That what EveryBody says must be true  If they who pronounce  this  meant that  Every thing must be True which has the univer∣sal Consent of Mankind  there might per∣haps be something in it but alas their Meaning is vastly different They only in∣fer That  when a Report or Opinion in any Place so far prevails as to become in that Place general that Report or Opinion must be true  So that in the Notion of these Gentlemen If Calumny at any Time so far prevails as to become  General  'tis no longer  Calumny  but  Truth  and a sure Consequence of this Doctrine is That  Popery  is the  best  Religion at  Rome  and  Mahometism  at  Constantinople  BUT how little do they who talk at this Rate know either of the Frailty or Malignity of Human Nature or the Transactions of their own Times or the Records of preceding ones Some of the best and most deserving Persons both among Ancients and Moderns have labour'd  under general Calumny under Calumnies which were not only inconsistent with com∣mon Sense but were directly contradictory of those Virtues and great Qualities for which they had long been eminent and for which some of them have been celebrated by  Twenty succeeding Centuries  and tho' the Truth was so manifestly on their Side yet some of these and those of the  most deserving  have been quite  oppress'd  by such Calumnies as  Socrates  and  Phocion  a∣mong the  Graecians  Among the  Ro∣mans Camillus  and  Coriolanus    SOCRATES  the most Religious and most Virtuous of all the  Athenians  was con∣demn'd and excuted as an  Atheist  and a  Corrupter of Youth  Among the  Jews  the Prophets were  ston'd  and  Jesus Christ  Himself was crucify'd as an  Imposter  and a  Blasphemer  YOU have very justly observ'd That Detraction brings most Disquiet to those who are most above itYou may say such Things without any Consequence to a worthless Fellow as will blow a Man of Honour into a Flame not to be quench'd but by Blood But if such Injuries are so insupportable to a Man of Honour when they come from one single Person provok'd perhaps by some ima∣ginary Offence and quite frantick with Passion and Wine what Impressions must they not make when they are whisper'd  in cold Blood by a Number of different Persons Such Slanders obstruct the Pro∣gress of Arts the Advancement of Learn∣ing and the Growth of Virtues by the killing Impressions which they make on IndividualsI wish you would proceed to show what Disorder they bring to Families and what Desolation to States  Hannibal  was undone and  Carthage  was ruin'd by the malicious  Slanders  of  Hanno  and the Duke of  Marlborough  's unparallel'd Victories cou'd not defend him against Ingratitude while the Malice of his Slanderers met with Countenance from Men in  Power  who being privately his Enemies had not  Soul  enough to sacrifice their  little Spleen  to the Love of their  Country  's  Glory  I am SIR Your most Obedient Servant  A B  DETRACTION  is an Evil which how∣ever hateful in its Nature the World must always expect to abound with And there∣fore since my Correspondent has written so much and so well in Detestation of this un∣generous Weakness all I will add upon the Subject shall be to advise those who suffer under the Severity of its Consequences rather to  despise  than  complain of  it To which End they wou'd do well to reflect on  the Answer of the Philosopher whom his Friends were urging to contrive some publick Means whereby to redeem himself from the Disgrace which he suffer'd under the Malice of some busy Slanderers  They who love me  said he  will give no Credit to malicious Rumours to my Disadvantage And as for those who hate me I will live in a Manner so contrary to what they believe of me that I will make 'em asham'd of their Credulity  THAT very  Socrates  which my Correspond∣ent so justly produces as one of the most glorious of all the  Victims  to  Slander  triumph'd over it in the very Current and full Force of its Influence For when  Aristophanes  in his Comedy call'd The  Clouds  had expos'd this great and virtuous Sufferer with the utmost Bitterness of  witty Malice  to the publick Spleen of the  Athenians Socrates  came in Person to see the Comedy acted and taking his Place in the most remarkable Part of the Theatre stood up and exposing himself to the Observation of the whole Audience told 'em aloud when the Play was over that  They had been at a merry Feast where He was serv'd up for their En∣tertainment nor was he angry to have been their standing Dish because the Aversion which some had brought with them wou'd last no longer than till they had tasted him  SINCE it is inseparable from Merit to be expos'd to  Envy  and Envy necessarily produces  Slander  there is no hoping to live  free from the Effects of this pernicious  Calumny  But next to not feeling it the most desirable Strength of Mind is  Not to appear to feel it  One of these is out of our Reach the other we may attain by Force of Reason and Resolution And its prettily observ'd in  Aelian  asserting that Defamation sinks deepest in weak Natures  The Slander of the  Strong  is like Water thrown against a Wall but the Slander of the  Weak  is like the Wall thrown into Water  To the Author of the  PLAIN DEALER  Sept    SIR  THE Lady who was the Occasion of my Writing the Song I have sent you has Merit enough to justify me both as a  Lover  and an  Author  When you have Room for it in your Paper you'll oblige me if you publish it  I am Your very Humble Servant  PHILANDER  O Love thou  neverabsent Thought  Thou  only  Purpose of the Mind  All  are to thy  Subjection  brought  Yet not  One Rebel  canst thou find  Thou God who dealst out every Human Lot  Whose Pow'r decrees who's  Happy  and who not  Reign  still  thus Mighty as thou art  I wish not Liberty restor'd  For the bright Idol of my Heart  Was born to Rule and be Ador'd  But oh the Passion which you raise  protect  Nor let such Truth be blasted by  Neglect    THE PLAIN DEALER No  Tantaene animis coelestibus irae  VIRG  MONDAY  October    I HAVE lately received a Letter con∣taining some Remarks on the Battle of the Angels as 'tis describ'd by  Milton  in the VIth Book of his  Paradise Lost  and I thought I could not find a more proper Occasion of publishing that Letter than just after the Feast of St  Michael  on the th of the last Month which was set apart by the Church to celebrate the Victory which that ArchAngel got over  Lucifer  and his rebellious Crew I make no Doubt but it will ap∣pear  that  Milton  by the Account which he has given of that Victory has gained a very glorious one himself and has carried away the Praise of Sublimity from all Poets both Antient and Modern  SIR  OF all the Commentators on the  Pa∣radise Lost  Mr  Addison  was certainly the most ingenious if he was not the most learned but he has not given  Milton  his full Due either through want of Discern∣ment or want of Impartiality In the th Page of the small Edition of his Notes upon the  Paradise Lost  he has these Words of the Author  MILTON's  chief Talent and indeed his distinguishing Excellence lies in the Sub∣limity of his Thoughts There are others of the Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry but in the Greatness of his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets both Moderns and Antients  Homer  only excepted  BUT as when a Man departs from Truth which is the only Bond of Union and Agreement both of our Sentiments with those of others and of our Sentiments with themselves he his ready immediately to differ from and to grow inconsistent with himself Mr  Addison  who expresly  here either equals or prefers  Homer  for the Greatness of his Sentiments before  Milton  contradicts himself at least no less than twice in the Course of his Observations For says he in the th Page of the fore∣said Edition  There is an indisputable and un∣questioned Magnificence in every Part of  Pa∣radise Lost  and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any  Pagan  System  Now if there is a greater Magni∣ficence in every Part of  Milton  's Poem there is by Consequence a greater Sublimity than there is in the  Iliad  which was form∣ed upon a  Pagan  System  AGAIN in the d Page of the foresaid Edition Mr  Addison  speaking of the Excellence of  Milton  's Performance in the Sixth Book of his Poem delivers him∣self thus  MILTON's  Genius which was so great in itself and so strengthened by all the Helps of Learning appears in this Book every way equal to his Subject which is the most sublime that could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet  NOW SIR if  Milton  's Subject is the most sublime that could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet and his Genius is every way equal to his Subject it follows That  Milton  is more exalted than any Poet who has not a Subject so elevated and consequently than  Homer  or any other Poet antient or modern  BUT as in the st Page of the foresaid Comment Mr  Addison  takes a great deal of Pains to shew the Greatness of one par∣ticular Passage of  Homer  and to describe it after  Longinus  in all those chosen Cir∣cumstances which may make it appear to be noble and exalted which Pains he has not taken with any other Passage we may rea∣sonably conclude that he believed this to be the most lofty of any that are in the Works of  Homer  as indeed it really is Now as there is a Passage in the th Book of  Paradise Lost  which was produced upon a parallel Occasion let us see if we cannot find by comparing them for the Honour of our Country that the Passage of our  Briton  is as much superior to that of the  Grecian  as the Angels of the one are more potent than the other's Gods or as the  Em∣pyrean  Heaven is more exalted than  Ossa Pelion  or  Olympus  IN order to this SIR give me leave to lay before you the Words which Mr  Addison  makes Use of to set sorth the masterly Strokes of  Homer  After he has told us That there is no Question but that  Milton  had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods in  Homer  before he entered upon the En∣gagement of the Angels of which by the Way I do not believe one Syllable I would sooner believe the greatest Absurdities of the  Alcoran  he is pleased to add what follows  HOMER  there gives us a Scene of Men Heroes and Gods mixed together in Battle  Mars  animates the contending Armies and lifts up his Voice in such a Manner that it is heard distinctly amidst all the Shouts and Confusion of the Fight  Jupiter  at the same Time thunders over their Heads while  Nep∣tune  raises such a Tempest that the whole Field of Battle and all the Tops of the Mountains shake about them The Poet tells us That  Pluto  himself whose Habitation was in the very Center of the Earth was so affrighted at the Shock that he leap'd from his Throne  Homer  afterwards describes  Vulcan  as pouring down a Storm of Fire upon the River  Xanthus  and  Minerva  as throwing a Rock at  Mars  who he tells us covered Seven Acres in his Fall  WITH these imaginary  ne plus ultra's  had Mr  Addison  so filled his Capacity that when Ten thousand greater Beauties are be∣fore his Eyes he stops short of them and never in the least discerns them as you will see immediately for thus he goes on  AS  Homer  has introduced into his Battle of the Gods every Thing that is great and ter∣rible in Nature  Milton  has filled his Fight af good and bad Angels with all the like Cir∣cumstances of Horror The Shout of Armies the Rattling of brazen Chariots the Hurling of Rocks and Mountains the Earthquake the Fire  the Thunder are all of them imployed to lift up the Reader's Imagination and give him a suitable Idea of so great an Action With what Art doth the Poet represent the whole Body of the Earth trembling even before it was created  THUS with this very pretty trifling Re∣mark does Mr  Addison  stop short within the very Touch of one of the vastest and the sublimest Beauties that ever was in∣spired by the God of Verse or by  Milton  's Godlike Genius when the very next Lines the very next Words strike and astonish us with such wonderful Ideas as are able to lift up the Reader's Imagination to a Thousand Times a greater Height than either the Shout of Armies the Rattling of brazen Chariots the Hurling of Rocks and Moun∣tains the Earthquake the Fire or the Thunder But that these Beauties may be seen in all their Lustre and in all their Glory give me leave to set the whole Passage before you  Th' ArchAngel's Trumpet through the Vast of Heav'n  Resounded and the faithful Armies rung  Hosanna to the Highest nor stood at gaze  The adverse Legions nor less hideous join'd  The horrid Shock now storming Fury rose  And Clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now  Was never Arms on Armour clashing bray'd  Horrible Discord and the madding Wheels  Of brazen Chariots rag'd Dire was the Noise  Of Conflict Overhead the dismal Hiss  Of fiery Darts in flaming Vollies flew  And flying vaulted either Host with Fire  So under fiery Cope together rush'd  Both Battles main with ruinous Assault  And inextinguishable Rage All Heav'n  Resounded and had Earth been then all Earth  Had to her Center shook What Wonder when  Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought  On either Side the least of whom could wield  These Elements and arm him with the Force  Of all the Regions  BUT now Sir if Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought on either Side and the very least the very weakest of so many Millions had Power to rend this Globe of Earth and Ocean from its Axle and whirl it with its dependent Atmo∣sphere through the Aethereal Regions what must be the unutterable the inconceivable Effect of so many Millions furiously con∣tending against each other and each of them exerting all his Might for Victory When  Each on himself relied  As only on His Arm the Moment lay  Of Victory  THESE are amazing these are astonish∣ing Ideas worthy of the great Original Fight the Battle of the  Empyrean  BUT now Sir if the least if the weakest of so many Millions as fought on either Side had Strength to remove this Globe of Earth with its dependent Ele∣ments what could not the greatest of them what could not  Lucifer  what could not the Prince of the ArchAngels  Michael  's nexttoAlmighty Arm do The follow∣ing Lines and our own Reflections on them may a little help to inform us  Long time in even Scale  The Battle hung till Satan who that Day  Prodigious Pow'r had shewn and met in Arms  No Equal ranging through the dire Attack  Of fighting Seraphim confus'd at length  Saw where the Sword of  Michael  smote and fell'd  Squadrons at once  BUT now Sir of whom were these Squadrons Why  Squadrons of those the least of whom could wield  These Elements and arm him with the Force  Of all their Regions  WHAT must the Power of that ArchAngel be who with one Stroke of his Sword could fell whole Squadrons of those  The least of whom could wield these Elements  And arm him with the Force of all their Regions
