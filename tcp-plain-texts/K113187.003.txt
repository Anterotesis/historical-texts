character of the poetry of queen Elisabeth's age  A DISSERTATION ON THE GESTA ROMANORUM  TALES are the learning of a rude age In the p  og  ess of letters speculation and enquiry commence with refinement of manners Literature becomes sentimental and discursive in proportion as a people is polished and men must be instructed by facts either real or imaginary before they can apprehend the subtleties of argument and the force of ref  ection  Vincent of Beauvais a learned Dominican of France who flourished in the thirteenth century observes in his MIRROR of HISTORY that it was a practice of the preachers of his age to rouse the indifference and relieve the languor of their hearers by quoting the fables of Esop yet at the same time he recommends a sparing and prudent application of these profane fancies in the discussion of sacred subjects  SPECUL HIST Lib iii c viii  ol b edit Ven  Among the Harleian  manuscripts in the British Museum we find a very antient collection of two hundred and fifteen stories romantic allegorical religious and legendary which were evidently compiled by a professed preacher for the use of monastic societies Some of these appear to have been committed to writing from the recitals of bards and minstrels others to have been invented and written by troubadours and monks  MSS HARL membran fol  In the year a grand system of divinity appeared at Paris afterwards translated by Caxton under the title of the COURT OF SAPYENCE which abounds with a multitude of historical examples parables and apologues and which the writer wisely supposes to be much more likely to interest the attention and excite the devotion of the people than the authority of science and the parade of theology In consequence of the expediency of this mode of of instruction the Legends of the Saints were received into the ritual and rehearsed in the course of public worship For religious romances were nearly allied to songs of chivalry and the same gross ignorance of the people which in the early centuries of christianity created a necessity of introducing the visible pomp of theatrical ceremonies into the churches was taught the duties of devotion by being amused with the achievements of spiritual knighterrantry and impressed with the examples of pious heroism In more cultivated periods the DECAMERON of Boccace and other books of that kind ought to be considered as the remnant of a species of writing which was founded on the simplicity of mankind and was adapted to the exigencies of the infancy of society  Many obsolete collections of this sort still remain both printed and manuscript containing narratives either fictitious or historical  Of king and heroes old  Such as the wise Demodocus once told  In solemn songs at king Alcinous' feast  Milton AT A VACATION EXERCISE c    But among the antient storybooks of this character a Latin compilation entitled GESTA ROMANORUM seems to have been the favorite  This piece has been before incidentally noticed but as it operated powerfully on the general body of our old poetry affording a variety of inventions not only to Chaucer Gower and Lydgate but to their distant successors I have judged it of sufficient importance to be examined at large in a separate dissertation which has been designedly reserved for this place for the purpose both of recapitulation and illustration and of giving the reader a more commodious opportunity of surveying at leisure from this intermediate point of view and under one comprehensive detail a connected display of the materials and original subjects of many of our past and future poets  Indeed in the times with which we are now about to be concerned it seems to have been growing more into esteem At the commencement of typography Wynkyn de Worde published this book in English This translation wasre printed by one Robinson in And afterwards of the same translation there were six impressions before the year  See supr vol ii p seq  There is an edition in black letter so late as the year About the year an English version appeared of  "Epitomes des cent HISTOIRES TRAGIQUES partie extraictes des ACTES DE  ROMAINS et autres c"  From the popularity or rather familiarity of this work in the reign of queen Elisabeth the title of GESTA GRAYORUM was affixed to the history of the acts of the Christmas Prince at Graysinn in  Printed or reprinted in to  In Sir GILES GOOSECAP an anonymous comedy presented by the Children of the Chapel in the year we have  "Then for your lordship's quips and quick jests why GESTA ROMANORUM were nothing to them  Lond Printed for John Windet to  "  And in George Chapman's MAYDAY a comedy printed at London in a man of the highest literary taste for the pieces in vogue is characterised  "One that has read Marcus Aurelius GESTA ROMANORUM the Mirrour of Magistrates cto be led by the nose like a blind beare that has read nothing  Act iii pag  "  The critics and collectors in blackletter I believe could produce many other proofs  The GESTA ROMANORUM were first printed without date but as it is supposed before or about the year in folio with this title  Incipiunt  HISTORIE NOTABILES  collecte ex  GESTIS ROMANORUM  et quibusdam aliis libris cum applicationibus eorundem  Much the same title occurs to a manuscript of this work in the Vatican  "Historiae Notabiles collectae ex Gestis Romanorum et quibusdam aliis libris cum explicationibus  orundem"  Montfauc Bibl MANUSCR tom i pag Num  This edition has one hundred and fiftytwo chapters or GESTS and one hundred and seventeen leaves  Without initials paging signatures or catchwords  It is in the Gothic letter and in two columns The first chapter is of king Pompey and the last of prince or king Cleonicus The initials are written in red and blue ink Thi  dition slightly mutilated is among bishop Tanner's printed books in the Bodleian library The reverend and learned doctor Farmer master of Emanuel college in Cambridge has the second edition as it seems printed at Louvain in quarto the same or the subsequent year by John de Westfalia under the title  Ex  GESTIS ROMANORUM HISTORIE NOTABILES  de viciis virtutibusque tractantes cum

correctis aliorum viciis impressit Joannes de Westfalia in alma Vniversitate Louvaniensi  It has one hundred and eightyone chapters  The first is of king Pompey as before The la  t is entitled De

edition with the use of which I have been politely favoured by George Mason esquire of AldenhamLodge in Hertfordshire was printed in folio and in the year with this title GESTA RHOMANORUM  cum

nre salutis  MCCCCLXXX viij  kalendas vero februarii  xviij A general and alphabetical table are subjoined The book which is printed in two columns and in the Gothic character abounding with abbreviations contains ninetythree leaves The initials are written or flourished in red and blue and all the capitals in the body of the text are miniated with a pen There were many other later editions  For which see supr vol ii p  I must add that the GESTA ROMANORUM were translated into Dutch so early as the year There is an old French version in the British Museum  This work is compiled from the obsolete Latin chronicles of the later Roman or rather German story heightened by romantic inventions from Legends of the Saints oriental apologues and many of the shorter fictitious narratives which came into Europe with the Arabian literature and were familiar in the ages of ignorance and imagination The classics are sometimes cited for authorities but these are of the lower order such as Valerius Maximus Macrobius Aulus Gallius Seneca Pliny and Boethius To every tale a MORALISATION is subjoined reducing it into a christian or moral lesson  Most of the oriental apologues are taken from the CLERICALIS DISCIPLINA or a latin Dialogue between an Arabian Philo  opher  and Edric  EDRIC was the name of ENOCH among the Arabians to whom they attribute many fabulous compositions Herbelot in V Lydgate's CHORLE and THE BIRD mentioned above is taken form the CLERICALIS DISCIPLINA of Alphonsus  his son never printed  MSS HARL And in many other libraries It occurs in old French vers  MSS DI  membran  "L  Romaunz  de Peres Aunfour coment il aprist et chastia son fils belement  "  See supr vol ii EMEND and ADD at pag  written by Peter Alphonsus a baptized Jew at the beginning of the twelfth century and collected from Arabian fables apothegms and examples  See Tyrwhitt's CHAUCER vol iv p seq  Some are also borrowed from an old Latin translation of the CALILAH U DAMNAH a celebrated sett of eastern fables to which Alphonsus was indebted  On the whole this is the collection in which a curious enquirer might expect to find the original of Chaucer's Cambuscan  Orif aught else great bards beside  In sage and solemn tunes have sung  Of turneys and of trophies hung  Of forests and inchantments drear  Where more is meant than meets the ear  Milton's IL PENSEROSO    Our author frequently cites GESTA ROMANORUM the title of his own work By which I understand no particular book of that name but the Roman History in general Thus in the title of the SAINT ALBANS CHRONICLE printed by Caxton  Titus Livyus  de GESTIS ROMANORUM is recited In the year Lucius Florus was printed at Paris under the same title  Apud Vascosan to  In the British Museum we find  "LES FAIS DE ROMAINS jusques a la  in de l' empire Domician selon Orose Justin Lucan c"  A plain historical deduction  MSS RE  C i  The ROMULEON an old manuscript history of Rome from the foundation of the city to Constantine the Great is also called de GESTIS ROMANORUM This manuscript occurs both in Latin and French and a French copy among the royal man  scripts  has the title  "ROMULEON ou des FAIS DE ROMAINS  MS E v  "  Among the manuscript books written by Lapus de Castellione a Florentine civilian who flourished about the year there is one  De Origine  URBIS ROMAE  et de  GESTIS ROMANORUM  See supr vol ii p  Gower in the CONFESSIO AMANTIS often introduces Roman stories with the Latin preamble  Hic secundum  GESTA Where he certainly means the Roman History which by degrees had acquired simply the appellation of GESTA Herman Korner in his CHRONICA NOVELLA written about the year refers for his vouchers to Bede Orosius Valerius Maximus Josephus Eusebius and the  Chronicon  et GESTA ROMANORUM Most probably to say no more by the CHRONICON he means the later writers of the Roman affairs such as Isidore and the monkish compilers and by GESTA the antient Roman history as related by Livy and the more established Latin historians  Neither is it possible that this work could have been brought as a proof or authority by any serious annalist for the Roman story  For though it bears the title of GESTA ROMANORUM yet this title by no means properly corresponds with the contents of the collection which as has been already hinted comprehends a multitude of narratives either not historical or in another respect such as are either totally unconnected with the Roman people or perhaps the most preposterous misrepresentations of their history To cover this deviation from the promised plan which by introducing a more ample variety of matter has contributed to encrease the reader's entertainment our collector has taken care to preface almost every story with the name or reign of a Roman emperor who at the same time is often a monarch that never existed and who seldom whether real or suppositious has any concern with the circumstances of the narrative  But I hasten to exhibit a compendious analysis of the chapters which form this very singular compilation intermixing occasional illustrations arising from the subject and shortening or lengthening my abridgement of the stories in proportion as I judge they are likely to interest the reader Where for that reason I have been very concise I have yet said enough to direct the critical antiquarian to this collection in case he should find a similar tale occurring in any of our old poets I have omitted the mention of a very few chapters which were beneath notice Sometimes where common authors are quoted I have only mentioned the author's name without specifying the substance of the quotation For it was necessary that the reader should be made acquainted with our collector's track of reading and the books which he used In the mean time this review will serve as a full notification of the edition of which is more comprehensive and complete than some others of later publication and to which all the rest as to a general criterion may be now comparatively referred  CHAP i Of a daughter of king Pompey whose chamber was guarded by five armed knights and a dog Being permitted to be present at a public shew she is  educed by a duke who is afterwards killed by the champion of her father's court She is reconciled to her father and betrothed to a nobleman on which occasion sh  receives from her father an embroidered robe and a crown of gold from the champion a gold ring another from the wise man who pacified the king's anger another from the king's son another from her cousin and from her spouse a seal of gold All these presents are inscribed with proverbial sentences suitable to the circumstances of the princess  The latter part of this story is evidently oriental The feudal manners in a book which professes to record the achievements of the Roman people are remarkable in the introductory circumstances But of this mixture we shall see many striking instances  CHAP ii Of a youth taken captive by pirates The king's  daughter falls in love with him and having procured his escape accompanies him to his own country where they are married  CHAP vi An emperor is married to a beautiful young princess In case of death they mutually agree not to survive one other To try the truth of his wife the emperor going into a distant country orders a report of his death to be circulated In remembrance of her vow and in imitation of the wives of India she prepares to throw herself headlong from a high precipice She is prevented by her father who interposes his paternal authority as predominating over a rash and unlawful promise  CHAP vii Under the reign of Dioclesian a noble knight had two sons the youngest of which marries a harlot  This story but with a difference of circumstances ends like the beautiful apologue of the Prodigal Son  CHAP viii The emperor Leo commands three female statues to be made One has a gold ring on a finger pointing forward another a beard of gold and the third a golden cloak and purple tunic Whoever steals any of these ornaments is to be punished with an ignominious death  This story is copied by Gower in the CONFESSIO AMANTIS but he has altered some of the circumstances He supposes a statue of Apollo  Of plate of golde a berde he hadde  The wiche his brest all ovir spradde  Of golde also without fayle  His mantell was of large entayle  Besette with perrey all aboute  Forth ryght he straught his fynger oute  Upon the whiche he had a rynge  To seen it was a ryche thynge  A fyne carbuncle for the nones  Moste precious of all stones  Lib v fol b    In the sequel Gower follows the substance of our author  CHAP x Vespasian marries a wife in a distant country who refuses to return home with him and yet declares she will kill herself if he goes The emperor ordered two rings to be made of a wonderous efficacy one of which in the stone has the image of Oblivion the other the image of Memory the ring of Oblivion he gave to the empress and returned home with the ring of Memory  CHAP xi The queen of the south sends her daughter to king Alexander to be his concubine She was exceedingly beautiful but had been nourished with poison from her birth Alexander's master Aristotle whose sagacity nothing could escape knowing this entreated that before she was admitted to the king's bed a malefactor condemned to death might be sent for who should give her a kiss in the presence of the king The malefactor on kissing her instantly dropped down dead Aristotle having explained his reasons for what he had done was loaded with honours by the king and the princess was dismissed to her mother  This story is founded on the twentyeighth chapter of Aristotle's SECRETUM SECRETORUM in which a queen of India is said to have treacherously sent to Alexander among other costly presents the pretended testimonies of her friendship a girl of exquisite beauty who having been fed with serpents from her infancy partook of their nature  See supr vol i p This I now cite from a Latin translation without date but evidently printed before It is dedicated to Guido Vere de Valencia bishop of Tripoly by his most humble Clerk Philippus who says that he found this treatise in Arabic at Antioch  quo  ar  bant L  ini  and that therefore and because the Arabic copies were scarce he translated it into Latin  This printed copy does not exactly correspond with MS BODL membr to In the last Alexander's miraculous horn is mentioned at fol b In the former in ch lxxii The dedication is the same in both  If I recollect right in Pliny there are accounts of nations whose natural food was poison Mithridates king of Pontus the land of venomous herbs and the country of the sorceress Medea was supposed to  eat poison Sir John Maundeville's Travels I believe will afford other instances  CHAP xii A profligate priest in the reign of the emperor Otto or Otho walking in the fields and neglecting to say mass is reformed by a vision of a comely old man  CHAP xiii An empress having lost her husband becomes so doatingly fond of her only son then three years of age as not to bear his absence for a moment They sleep together every night and when he was eighteen years of age she proves with child by him She murthers the infant and her left hand is immediately marked with four circles of blood Her repentance is related in consequence of a vision of the holy virgin  This story is in the SPECULUM HISTORIALE of Vincent of Beauvais who wrote about the year  Lib vii cap seq f b edit Ven    CHAP xiv Under the reign of the emperor Dorotheus a remarkable example of the filial piety of a young man who redeems his father a knight from captivity  CHAP xv Eufemian a nobleman in the court of the emperor of Rome is attended by three thousand servants girt with golden belts and cloathed in silken vestments His house was crouded with pilgrims orphans and widows for whom three tables were kept every day He has a son Allexius who quits his father's palace and lives unknown seventeen years in a monastery in Syria He then returns and lives seventeen years undiscovered as a pilgrim in his father's family where he suffers many indignities from the servants  Allexius or Alexis was canonised This story is taken from his Legend  See Caxton GOLD LEG f ccclxiii b  In the metrical Lives of the Saints his life is told in a sort of measure different from that of the rest and not very common in the earlier stages of our poetry It begins thus  Lesteneth alle and herkeneth me  Ʒonge and olde bonde and fre  And ich ʒow telle sone

Roman emperor in digging for the foundation of a new palace finds a golden sarcophagus or coffin inscribed with mysterious words and sentences Which being explained prove to be so many moral lessons

"you will kill your father and mother"  On this he went into a distant country where he married a rich Lady of a castle Julian's father and mother travelled into various lands to find their son and at length accidentally came to this castle in his absence where telling their story to the lady who had heard it from her husband she discovered who they were and gave them her own bed to sleep in Early in the morning while she was at mass in the chapel her husband Julian unexpectedly returned and entering his wife's chamber perceived two persons in the bed whom he immediately slew with his sword hastily supposing them to be his wife and her adulterer At leaving the chamber he met his wife coming from the chapel and with great astonishment asked her who the persons were sleeping in her bed She answered  "They are your parents who have been seeking you so long and whom I have honoured with a place in our own bed"  Afterwards they founded a sumptuous hospital for the accommodation of travellers on the banks of a dangerous river  This story is told in Caxton's GOLDEN LEGENDE  Fol edit  and in  the metrical Lives of the Saints  MSS BODL f  Hence Julian or Saint Julian was called

account of this saint which appears also to be literally the same  ACT SANCTOR tom ii JANUAR p Antv  It is told yet not exactly in the same words by Vincent of Beauvais  SP  CUL HIST Lib ix c f Venet    I take this opportunity of observing that the Legends of the the Saints so frequently referred to in the GESTA ROMANORUM often contain high strokes of fancy both in the structure and decorations of the story That they should abound in extravagant conceptions may be partly accounted for from the superstitious and visionary cast of the writer but the truth is they derive this complexion from the east Some were originally forged by monks of the Greek church to whom the oriental fictions and mode of fabling were familiar The more early of the Latin lives were carried over to Constantinople where they were translated into Greek with new embellishments of eastern imagination These being returned into Europe were translated into Latin where they naturally superseded the old Latin archetypes Others of the Latin lives contracted this tincture from being written after the Arabian literature became common in Europe The following ideas in the Life of Saint Pelagian  evidently betray their original  "As the bysshop sange masse in the cyte of Usanance he saw thre dropes ryghte clere all of one gratenesse whiche were upon the aulter and al thre ranne to gyder in to a precyous gemme and whan they had set thys gemme in a crosse of golde al the other precyous stones that were there fyllen  Fell out  out and thys gemme was clere to them that were clene out of synne and it was obscure and darke to synners  Caxton's GOLD LEG f ccclxxxxviii  c"  The peculiar cast of romantic invention was admirably suited to serve the purposes of superstition  Possevin a learned Jesuit who wrote about the close of the sixteenth century complains that for the last five hundred years the courts of all the princes in Europe had been infatuated by reading romances and that in his time it was a mark of inelegance not to be familiarly acquainted with Lancelot du Lake Perceforest Tristan Giron the Courteous Amadis de Gaul Primaleon Boccace's Decameron and Ariosto He even goes so far as to say that the devil instigated Luther to procure a translation of Amadis from Spanish into French for the purpose of facilitating his grand scheme of overthrowing the catholic religion The popularity of this book he adds warped the minds of the French nation from their antient notions and studies introduced a neglect of the scriptures and propagated a love for astrology and other fantastic arts  BI  LIOTH SELECT Lib i cap p edit  But with the leave of this zealous catholic I would observe that this sort of reading was likely to produce if any an effect quite contrary The genius of romance and of popery was the same and both were strengthened by the reciprocation of a similar spirit of credulity The dragons and the castles of the one were of a piece with the visions and pretended miracles of the other The ridiculous theories of false and unsolid science which by the way had been familiarised to the French by other romances long before the translation of Amadis were surely more likely to be advanced under the influence of a religion founded on  deception than in consequence of Luther's reformed system which aimed at purity and truth and which was to gain its end by the suppression of antient prejudices  Many of the absurdities of the catholic worship were perhaps as I have hinted in some degree necessary in the early ages of the church on account of the ignorance of the people at least under such circumstances they were natural and therefore excusable But when the world became wiser those mummeries should have been abolished for the same reason that the preachers left off quoting Esop's fables in their sermons and the stage ceased to instruct the people in the scripturehistory by the representation of the MYSTERIES The advocates of the papal

barbarism and of which the use now no longer subsists  CHAP xix When Julius Cesar was preparing to pass the Rubicon a gigantic spectre appeared from the middle of the river threatening to interrupt his passage if he came not to establish the peace of Rome Our author cites the GESTA ROMANORUM for this story  It was impossible that the Roman history could pass through the dark ages without being infected with many romantic corruptions Indeed the Roman was almost the only antient history which the readers of those ages knew and what related even to pagan Rome the parent of the more modern papal metropolis of christianity was regarded with a superstitious veneration and often magnified with miraculous additions  CHAP xx The birth of the emperor Henry son of earl Leopold and his wonderful preservation from the stratagems of the emperor Conrade till his accession to the imperial throne  This story is told by Caxton in the GOLDEN LEGENDE under the life of Pelagian the pope

fertile in legendary matter and furnished Jacobus de Voragine Caxton's original with many marvellous histories  See his LEGEND AUR fol cccxv  Caxton from the  gestes of the Lombardis  gives a wonderful account of a pestilence in Italy under the reign of king Gilbert  Ubi supr f lxxvi    There is a LEGENDA SANCTORUM  ive HISTORIA LOMBARDICA printed in This very uncommon book is not mentioned by Maittaire It has this colophon  "Expliciunt quorundam Sanctorum Legende adjuncte post Lombardicam historiam Impressa Argentine M CCCC LXXXIII  Fol  "  That is the latter part of the book contains a few Saints not in the history of the Lombards which forms the first part I have neither time nor inclination to examine whether this is Jacobus's LEGENDA but I believe it to be the same I

de Voragine This perhaps is not precisely true Caxton informs us in his first preface to the first edition of  Fol  at Westminster This is one of the  nest of Caxton's publications  that he had in his possession a Legend in French another in Latin and a third in English which varied from the other two in many places and that MANY HISTORIES were contained in the English collection which did not occur in the French and Latin Therefore says he  "I have wryton ON  OUTE of the sayd three bookes which I have orderyd otherwyse than in the sayd  Englysshe Legende  which was so to fore made"

CHAP xxxix Julius Cesar's mediation between two brothers From the GESTA ROMANORUM  We must not forget that there was the Romance of JULIUS CESAR And I believe Antony and Cleopatra were more known characters in the dark ages than is commonly supposed Shakespeare is thought to have formed his play on this story from North's translation of Amyot's unauthentic French Plutarch published at London in Montfaucon among the manuscripts of monsieur Lancelot recites an old piece written about the year  "LA VIE ET FAIS DE MARC ANTOINE le triumvir et de sa mie CLEOPATRA translatè de l' historien Plutarque pour tres illustre haute et puissante dame Madame Françoise de Fouez Dame de Châteaubriand  Bibl MANUSCR tom ii p col  "  I know not whether t  is piece was ever printed At least it shews that the story was familiar at a more early period than is imagined and leads us to suspect that there might have been other materials used by Shakespeare on this subject than those hitherto pointed out by his commentators  That Amyot's French version of Plutarch should contain corruptions and innovations will easily be conceived when it is remembered that he probably translated from an old Italian version  See BIBL FR de la Croix c tom i p Amyot was a great translator of Greek books but I fear not always from the Greek It is remarkable that he wa  rewarded with an abba  y for

written as appears by the rubric of the last section by  Le Comte de Tankarville  Pliny in relating this story says that the temperature of glass so as to render it flexible was discovered under the reign of Tiberius  In the same chapter Pliny observes that glass is susceptible of all colours  "Fit et album et murrhinum aut hyacinthos sapphirosque imitatum et omnibus aliis coloribus Nec est alia nunc materia sequacior aut etiam PICTURAE ACCOMMODATIOR Maximus tamen honor in candido  NAT HIST Lib xxxvi cap xvi p edit Lugd  "  But the Romans as the last sentence partly proves probably never used any coloured glass for windows The first notice of windows of a church made of coloured glass occurs in chronicles quoted by Muratori In the year a pope built a church at Rome and  "fenestras ex vitro diversis coloribus conclusit atque decoravit  DISSERT ANTICHIT ITAL tom i c xxiv p  "  And in he produces  "fenestras vero vitreis coloribus c  Ibid p  "  This however was a sort of mosaic in glass To express figures in glass or what we now call the art of  painting in glass was a very different work and I believe I can shew it was brought from Constantinople to Rome before the tenth century with other ornamental arts Guiccardini who wrote about in his  Descrittione de tutti Paesi Bassi  ascribes the invention of baking colours in glass for churchwindows to the Netherlanders  Antw Plantin fol  but he does not mention the period and I think he must be mistaken It is certain that this art owed much to the laborious and mechanical genius of the Germans and in particular their deep researches and experiments in chemistry which they cultivated in the dark ages with the most indefatigable assiduity must have greatly assisted its operations I could give very early anecdotes of this art in England But with the careless haste of a lover I am anticipating what I have to say of it in my HISTORY OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE IN ENGLAND  CHAP xlv A king leaves four sons by his wife only one which

of being much struck with her beauty The table was covered with the richest dainties but while all were served in golden dishes a pittance of meat was placed before the lady in a dish made out of a human scull The merchant was surprised and terrified at this strange spectacle At length he was conducted to bed in a fair chamber  where when left alone he observed a glimmering lamp in a nook or corner of the room by which he discovered two dead bodies hung up by the arms He was now filled with the most horrible apprehensions and could not sleep all the night When he rose in the morning he was asked by the nobleman how he liked his entertainment He answered  "There is plenty of every thing but the scull prevented me from eating at supper and the two dead bodies which I saw in my chamber from sleeping With your leave therefore I will depart"  The nobleman answered  "My friend you observed the beauty of my wife The scull which you saw placed before her at supper was the head of a duke whom I detected in her embraces and which I cut off with my own sword As a memorial of her crime and to teach her modest behaviour her adulterer's scull is made to serve for her dish The bodies of the two young men hanging in the chamber are my two kinsmen who were murthered by the son of the duke To keep up my sense of revenge for their blood I visit their dead bodies every day Go in peace and

being concerned in the theft The hermit seeing an innocent man put to death began to suspect the existence of a divine Providence and resolved no longer to perplex himself with the useless seveties of religion but to mix in the world In travelling from his retirement he was met by an angel in the figure of a man who said  "I am an angel and am sent by God to be your companion on the road"  They entered a city and begged for lodging at the house of a knight who entertained them at a splendid supper In the night the angel rose from his bed and strangled the knight's only child who was asleep in the  cradle The hermit was astonished at this barbarous return for so much hospitality but was afraid to make any remonstrance to his companion Next morning they went to another city Here they were liberally received in the house of an opulent citizen but in the night the angel rose and stole a golden cup of inestimable value The hermit now concluded that his companion was a Bad Angel In travelling forward the next morning they passed over a bridge about the middle of which they met a poor man of whom the angel asked the way to the next city Having received the desired information the angel pushed the poor man into the water where he was immediately drowned In the evening they arrived at the house of a rich man and begging for a lodging were ordered to sleep in a shed with the cattle In the morning the angel gave the rich man the cup which he had stolen The hermit amazed that the cup which was stolen from their friend and benefactor should be given to one who refused them a lodging began to be now convinced that his companion was the devil and begged to go on alone But the angel said  "Hear me and depart When you lived in your hermitage a shepherd was killed by his master He was innocent of the supposed offence but had he not been then killed he would have committed crimes in which he would have died impenitent His master endeavours to atone for the murther by dedicating the remainder of his days to alms and deeds of charity I strangled the child of the knight But know that the father was so intent on heaping up riches for this child as to neglect those acts of public munificence for which he was before so distinguished and to which he has now returned I stole the golden cup of the hospitable citizen But know that from a life of the  trictest temperance he became in consequence of possessing this cup a perpetual drunkard and is now the most abstemious of men I threw the poor man into the water He was then honest and religious But know had he walked one half of a mile further he would  have murthered a man in a state of mortal sin I gave the golden cup to the rich man who refused to take us within his roof He has therefore received his reward in this world and in the next will suffer the pains of hell for his inhospitality"  The hermit fell prostrate at the angel's feet and requesting forgiveness returned to his hermitage fully convinced of the wisdom and justice of God's government  This is the fable of Parnell's HERMIT which that elegant yet original writer has heightened with many masterly touches of poetical colouring and a happier arrangement of circumstances Among other proofs which might be mentioned of Parnell's genius and address in treating this subject by reserving the discovery of the angel to a critical period at the close of the fable he has found means to introduce a beautiful description and an interesting surprise In this poem the last instance of the angel's seeming injustice is that of pushing the guide from the bridge into the river At this the hermit is unable to suppress his indignation  Wild sparkling rage inflames the Father's eyes  He bursts the bonds of fear and madly cries  "Detested wretch"But scarce his speech began  When the strange partner seem'd no longer man  His youthful face grew more serenely sweet  His robe turn'd white and flow'd upon his feet  Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair  Celestial odours fill the purple air  And wings whose colours glitter'd on the day  Wide at his back their gradual plumes display  The form ethereal bursts upon his sight  And moves in all the majesty of light  The same apologue occurs with some slight additions and variations for the worse in Howell's LETTERS who professes to have taken it from the  speculative

Heremitam ad diversa Hospitia  who has illustrated its important moral with the following fine reflections  "The affairs of this world are like a curious but intricately contrived Comedy and we cannot judge of the tendency of what is past or acting at present before the entrance of the last Act which shall bring in Righteousness in triumph who though she hath abided many a brunt and has been very cruelly and despightfully used hitherto in the world yet at last according to our desires we shall see the knight overcome the giant For what is the reason we are so much pleased with the reading romances and the fictions of the poets but that here as Aristotle says things are set down as they should be but in the true history hitherto of the world things are recorded indeed as they are but it is but a testimony that they have not been as they should be Wherefore in the upshot of all when we shall see that come to pass that so mightily pleases us in the reading the most ingenious plays and heroick poems that long afflicted vertue at last comes to the crown the mouth of all unbelievers must be for ever stopped And for my own part I doubt not but that it will so come to pass in the close of the world But impatiently to call for vengeance upon every enormity before that time is rudely to overturn the stage before the entrance into the fifth act out of ignorance of the plot of the comedy and to prevent the solemnity of the general judgement by more paltry and particular executions  Ibid p  "  Parnell seems to have chiefly followed the story as it is told by this Platonic theologist who had not less imagination than learning Pope used to say that it was originally written in  Spanish This I do not believe but from the early connection between the Spaniards and Arabians this assertion tends to confirm the suspicion that it was an oriental tale  CHAP lxxxi A king violates his sister The child is exposed in a chest in the sea is christened Gregory by an abbot who takes

another country Going to rest the first night he was led into a chamber furnished with a bed richly embroidered but stuck all over with sharp razors This kingdom he also relinquishes At length he meets a hermit who gives him a staff with which he is directed to knock at the gate of a magnificent palace seated on a lofty mountain Here he gains admittance and finds every sort of happiness unembittered with the laest degree of pain  The king means every man advanced to riches and honour and who thinks to enjoy these advantages without interruption and alloy The hermit is religion the staff penitence and the palace heaven  In a more confined sense the first part of this apologue may be separately interpreted to signify that a king when he enters on his important charge ought not to suppose himself to succeed to the privilege of an exemption from care and to be put into immediate possession of the highest pleasures conveniencies and felicities of life but to be sensible that from that moment he begins to encounter the greatest dangers and difficulties  CHAP cii Of the lady of a knight who went to the holy land She commits adultery with a clerk skilled in necromancy Another

into a deep pit to be devoured by a hungry lion The lion fawns on the knight whom he perceives to be the same that drew the thorn from his paw Then said the king  "I will learn forbearance from the beasts As the lion has spared your life when it was in his power to take it I therefore grant you a free pardon Depart and be admonished hence to live virtuously"  The learned reader must immediately recollect a similar story of one Androclus who being exposed to fight with wild beasts in the Roman amphitheatre is recognised and unattacked by a most savage lion whom he had formerly healed exactly in the same manner But I believe the whole is nothing more than an oriental apologue on gratitude written much earlier and that it here exists in its original state Androclus's story is related by Aulus Gellius on the authority of a Greek writer one Appion called Plistonices who flourished under Tiberius The character of Appion with which Gellius prefaces this tale in some measure invalidates his credit notwithstanding he pretends to  have been an eye witness of this extraordinary fact  "Ejus libri says Gellius non incelebres feruntur quibus  omnium  ferme quae  mirifica  in Aegypto visuntur audiunturque historia comprehenditur Sed in his quae audivisse et legisse  ese dicit fortasse a vitio studioque  ostentationis  it  loquacior  c  NOCT ATT  C Lib v cap xiv See another fabulous story of which Appio  was an eye witness ibid L vii cap viii It is of a boy beloved by a dolphin  "  Had our compiler of the GESTA taken this story from Gellius it is probable he would have told it with some of the same circumstances especially as Gellius is a writer whom he frequently follows and even quotes and to whom on this occasion he might have been obliged for a few more strokes of the marvellous But the two writers agree only in the general subject Our compiler's narrative has much more simplicity than that of Gellius and contains marks of eastern manners and life Let me add that the oriental fabulists are fond of illustrating and enforcing the duty of gratitude by feigning instances of the gratitude of beasts towards men And of this the present compilation which is strongly tinctured with orientalism affords several other proofs  CHAP cv Theodosius the bl  d emperor ordained that the cause of every injured person should be heard on ringing a bell placed in a public part of his palace A serpent had a nest near the spot where the bellrope fell In the absence of the serpent a toad took possession of her nest The serpent twisting herself round the rope rang the bell for justice and by the emperor's special command the toad was killed A few days afterwards as the king was reposing on his couch the serpent entered the chamber bearing a precious stone in her mouth The serpent creeping up to the emperor's face laid the precious stone on his eyes and glided out of the apartment Immediately the emperor was restored to his sight  This circumstance of the Bell of Justice occurs in the real history of some eastern monarch whose name I have forgot  In the Arabian philosophy serpents either from the brightness of their eyes or because they inhabit the cavities of the earth were considered as having a natural or occult connection with precious stones In Alphonsus's CLERICALIS DISCIPLINA a snake is mentioned whose eyes were real jacinths In Alexander's romantic history he is said to have found serpents in the vale of Jordian with collars of huge emeralds growing on their necks  Vincent Beauvais SPECUL HIST Lib iv c fol a  The toad under

who came to see this famous image observed as the sun shone against it the shadow of the inscribed finger on the ground at some distance He immediately took a spade and began to dig exactly on that spot He came at length to a flight of steps which descended far under ground and led him to a stately palace Here he entered a hall where he saw a king and queen sitting at table with their nobles and a multitude of people all clothed in rich garments But no person spake a word He looked towards one corner where he saw a polished carbuncle which illuminated the whole room  See supr vol ii p So in

written  "I am who am Nothing can escape my stroke not even yonder carbuncle which shines so bright"  The Clerk beheld all with amazement and entering a chamber saw the most beautiful ladies working at the loom in purple  The original is  "  mulieres pulcherrimas  in purpura et pallo operantes  invenit  "  fol L a col This may mean either the sense in the text or that the ladies were  cloathed in purpura et pallo  a phrase which I never saw before in barbarous latinity but which tallies with the old English expression  purple  and  pall  This is sometimes written  purple pall  As in SYR LAUNFAL ut supr fol a  The lady was clad yn  purpure palle  Antiently  Pallium  as did  Purpura  signified in general any rich cloth Thus there were saddles de  pallio  et ebore a bed de  pallio  a

of them and they were instantly turned into stone He next surveyed all the apartments of the palace which abounded  with all that his wishes could desire He again visited the hal  and now began to reflect how he should return  "but says he my report of all these wonders will not be believed unless I carry something back with me"  He therefore took from the principal table a golden cup and a golden knife and placed them in his bosom When the man who stood in the corner with the bow immediately shot at the carbuncle which he shattered into a thousand pieces At that moment the hall became dark as night In this darkness not being able to find hi  way he remained in the subterraneous palace and soon died a miserable death  In the MORALISATION of this story the steps by which the Clerk descends into the earth are supposed to be the Passions The palace so richly stored is the world with all its vanities and temptations The figure with the bow bent is Death and the carbuncle is Human Life He suffers for his avarice in coveting and seizing what was not his own and no sooner has he taken the golden knife and cup that is enriched himself with the goods of this world than he is delivered up to the gloom and horrors of the grave  Spenser in the FAERIE QUEENE seems to have distantly remembered this fable where a fiend expecting sir Guyon will be tempted to snatch some of the treasures of the subterraneous HOUSE OF RICHESSE which are displayed in his view i  prepared to fasten upon him  Thereat the fiend his gnas  ing teeth did grate  And griev'd so long to lack his

     This story was originally invented of pope Gerbert or Sylvester  the second who died in the year He was eminently learned in the mathematical sciences and on that account was styled a magician William of Malmesbury is I believe the first writer now extant by whom it is recorded and he produces it partly to shew that Gerbert was not always successful in those attempts which he so frequently practised to discover treasures hid in the earth by the application of the necromantic arts I will translate Malmesbury's narration of this fable as it varies in some of the circumstances and has some heightenings of the fiction  "At Rome there was a brazen statue extending the forefinger of the right hand and on its forehead was written  Strike here  Being suspected to conceal a treasure it had received many bruises from the credulous and ignorant in their endeavours to open it At length Gerbert unriddled the mystery At noonday observing the reflection of the forefinger on the ground he marked the spot At night he came to the place with a page carrying a lamp There by a magical operation he opened a wide passage in the earth through which they both descended and came to a vast palace The walls the beams and the whole structure were of gold they saw golden images of knights playing at chess with a king and queen of gold at a banquet with numerous attendants in gold and cups of immense size and value In a recess was a carbuncle whose lustre illuminated the whole palace opposite to which stood a figure with a bended bow As they attempted to touch some of the rich furniture all the golden images seemed to rush upon them Gerbert was too wise to attempt this a second time but the page was bold enough to snatch from the table a golden knife of exquisite workmanship At that moment all the golden images rose up with a dreadful noise the figure with the bow shot at the carbuncle and a total darkness ensued The page then replaced the knife otherwise they both would have suffered a cruel death"  Malmesbury afterwards mentions a brazen bridge framed by the enchantments of Gerbert beyond which  were golden horses of a gigantic size with riders of gold richly illuminated by the most serene meridian sun A large company attempt to pass the bridge with a design of stealing some pieces of the gold Immediately the bridge rose from its foundations and stood perpendicular on one end a brazen man appeared from beneath it who struck the water with a mace of brass and the sky was overspread with the most horrible gloom Gerbert like some other learned necromancers of the Gothic ages was supposed to have fabricated a brazen head under the influence of certain planets which answered questions But I forbear to suggest any more hints for a future collection of Arabian tales I shall only add Malmesbury's account of the education of Gerbert which is a curious illustration of what has been often inculcated in these volumes concerning the introduction of romantic fiction into Europe  See DISS i And vol i seq    "Gerbert a native of France went into Spain for the purpose of learning astrology and other sciences of that cast of the Saracens who to this day occupy the upper regions of Spain They are seated in the metropolis of Seville where according to the customary practice of their country they study the arts of divination and enchantmentHere Gerbert soon exceeded Ptolemy in the astrolabe Alchind in astronomy and Julius Firmicus in fatality Here he learned the meaning of the flight and language of birds and was taught how to raise spectres from hell Here he acquired whatever human curiosity has discovered for the destruction or convenience of mankind I say nothing of his knowledge in arithmetic music and geometry which he so fully understood as to think them beneath his genius and which he yet with great industry introduced into France where they had been long forgotten He certainly was the first who brought the algorithm from the Saracens and who illustrated it with  such rules as the most studious in that science cannot explain He lodged with a philosopher of that sect  De GEST REG ANGL lib ii cap p a b a b edit Savil Lond

the remote but original source of Shakespeare's CASKETTS in the MERCHANT OF VENICE I will give the reader a translation of the passage in which it occurs from the Greek original never yet printed  "The king commanded four chests to be made two of which were covered with gold and secured by golden locks but  filled with the rotten bones of human carcasses The other two were overlaid with pitch and bound with rough cords but replenished with pretious stones and the most exquisite gems and with ointments of the richest odour He called his nobles together and placing these chests before them asked which they thought the most valuable They pronounced those with the golden coverings to be the most pretious supposing they were made to contain the crowns and girdles of the king  In doctor Johnson's abridgement of a tale like this from Boccace which he supposes to have been Shakespeare's original the king says that in one of the Caskets was  "contained his crown sceptre and jewels c"  See Steeven  's SHAKESPEARE vol iii p edit  The two chests covered with pitch they viewed with contempt Then said the king I presumed what would be your determination for ye look with the eyes of

the age of twelve years he would be blind The king commanded an apartment to be hewed within a rock into which no light could enter and here he shut up the boy totally in the dark yet with proper attendants for twelve years At the end of which time he brought him abroad from his gloomy chamber and placed in his view men women gold pretious stones rich garments chariots of exquisite workmanship  drawn by horses with golden bridles heaps of purple tapestry armed knights on horseback oxen and sheep These were all distinctly pointed out to the youth but being most pleased with the women he desired to know by what name they were called An esquire of the king jocosely told him that they were devils who catch men Being brought to the king he was asked which he liked best of all the fine

romantic legend of Barlaam and Josaphat which is a history of considerable length is undoubtedly the composition of one who had an intercourse with the east and from the strong traces which it

poor man who gathered sticks in the forest hearing his cries drew him up together with the lion the ape and the serpent The Seneshall returned home promising to reward the poor man with great riches Soon afterwards the poor man went to the palace to claim the promised reward but was ordered to be cruelly beaten by the seneshall In the mean time the lion drove ten asses laden with gold to the poor man's cottage the serpent brought him a pretious stone of three colours and the ape when he came to the forest on his daily business laid him heaps of wood The poor man in consequence of the virtues of the serpent's pretious stone  which he sold arrived to the dignity of knighthood and acquired ample possessions But afterwards he found the pretious stone in his chest which he presented to the king The king having heard the whole story ordered the seneshall to be put to death for his ingratitude and preferred the poor man to his office  This story occurs in Symeon Seth's translation of the celebrated Arabian fablebook called CALILAH U DUMNAH  P This work was translated into Engli  under the title of  "Donies MORALL PHILOSOPHIE translated from the Indian tongue "  Black Letter with

amidst the general festivity the king was sad and silent All the guests were surprised and perplexed at the king's melancholy but at length his brother ventured to ask him the cause  The king replied  "Go home and you shall hear my answer to morrow"  The king ordered his trumpeters to sound early the next morning before his brother's gate and to bring him with them to judgement The brother on hearing this unexpected dreadful summons was seized with horror and came before the king in a black robe The king commanded a deep pit to be made and a chair composed of the most frail materials and supported by four slight legs to be placed inclining over the edge of the pit In this the brother being stripped naked was seated Over his head a sharp sword was hung by a small thread of silk Around him four men were stationed with swords exceedingly sharp who were to wait for the king's word and then to kill him In the mean time a table covered with the most costly dishes was spread before him accompanied with all sorts of music Then said the king  "My brother why are you so sad Can you be dejected in the midst of this delicious music and with all these choice dainties"  He answered  "How can I be glad when I have this morning heard the trumpet of death at my doors and while I am seated in this tottering chair If I make the smallest motion it will break and I shall fall into the pit from which I shall never arise again If I lift my head the suspended sword will penetrate my brain while these four tormentors only wait your command to put me to death"  The king replied  "Now I will answer your question why I was sad yesterday I am exactly in your situation I am seated like you in a frail and perishable chair ready to tumble to pieces every moment and to throw me into the infernal pit Divine judgement like this sharp sword hangs over my head and I am surrounded like you with four executioners That before me is Death whose coming I cannot tell that behind me my Sins which are prepared to accuse me before the tribunal of God that on the right the Devil who is ever watching for his prey and that on the left the Worm who is now  after my flesh Go in peace my  dearest brother and never ask me again why I am sad at a feast"  Gower in the CONFESSIO AMANTIS may perhaps have copied the circumstance of the morning trumpet from this apologue His king is a king of Hungary  It so befell that on a dawe  There was ordeined by the lawe  A Trompe with a sterne breathe  Which was cleped the Trompe of deathe  And in the court where the kyng was  A certaine man this

engagements of modern times to relieve a tedious evening Hence we learn that when a company was assembled if a  jugler or a minstrel were not present it was their custom to entertain themselves by relating or hearing a series of adventures Thus the general plan of the CANTERBURY TALES which at first sight seems to be merely an ingenious invention of the poet to serve a particular occasion is in great measure founded on a fashion of antient life and Chaucer in supposing each of the pilgrims to tell a tale as they are travelling to Becket's shrine only makes them adopt a mode of amusement which was common to the conversations of his age I do not deny that Chaucer has shewn his address in the use and application of this practice  So habitual was this amusement in the dark ages that the graver sort thought it unsafe for ecclesiastics if the subjects admitted any degree of levity The following curious injunction was deemed necessary in a code of statutes assigned to a college at

complains that the manuscript was brought to him from Bononia so illwritten that it was often impossible even to guess at  Josep  us's words  And in another place he says Josephus first wrote the

instantly disappeared after administering the draught which was of so wonderful a nature as to dispel the most oppressive lassitude and to make the body more vigorous than before At length a hunter

second Fable of his CLERICALIS DISCIPLINA  I take the liberty of introducing a small digression here which refers to two pieces of the poet lastmentioned never enumerated among his works In the year Caxton printed at Westminster  "  The PYLGREMAGE  OF THE SOWLE  translated oute of Frensshe into Englisshe Full of devout maters touching the sowle and many questyons assoyled to cause a man to lyve the better c Emprinted at Westminster by William Caxton the first yere of kynge Edward  V  "  The French book which is a vision and has some degree of imagination is probably the PELERIN DE L'AME of Guillaume prior of Chaulis  See supr vol ii p  This translation was made from the French with additions in the year For in the colophon are these words  "Here endeth the dreme of the PYLGREMAGE OF THE SOWLE translated out of Frensche into Englisshe with somwhat of Addicions the yere of our lorde M CCCC and thyrteen and endethe in the vigyle of seint Bartholomew"  The translator of this book at least the author of the  Addicions  which altogether consist of poetry in sevenlined stanzas I believe to be Lydgate Not to insist on the correspondence of time and style I observe that the thirtyfourth chapter of Lydgate's metrical LIFE OF THE VIRGIN MARY is literally repeated in the thirtyfourth chapter of this Translation This chapter is a digression of five or six stanzas in praise of Chaucer in which the writer feelingly laments the recent death of his  maister Chaucer poete of Britaine  who used to  amende and correcte the wronge traces of my rude penne  No writer besides in Lydgate's own lifetime can be supposed with any sort of grace or propriety to have mentioned those personal assistances of Chaucer in Lydgate's own  words And if we suppose that the Translation or its  Addicions  were written by Lydgate before he wrote his LIFE OF THE VIRGIN the proof will be the same  Stowe mentions Lydgate's  "PILGRIMAGE OF THE WORLD by the commaundement of the earle of Salisburie "  But this must be a different work Ad calc Opp Chauc fol col    Another piece probably written by Lydgate yet never supposed or acknowledged to be of his composition is a poem in the octave stanza containing thirtyseven leaves in folio and entitled LABEROUS AND MARVEYLOUS WORKE OF SAPIENCE After a long debate between MERCY and TRUTH and JUSTICE and PEACE all the products of nature and of human knowledge are described as they stand arranged in the palace and dominions of WISDOM It is generally allowed to have been printed by Caxton it has not the name of the printer nor any date Had it been written by Caxton as I once hastily suspected or by any of his cotemporaries the name of Lydgate would have appeared in conjunction with those of Gower and Chaucer who are highly celebrated in the Prologue as  erthely gods expert in poesie  for these three writers were constantly joined in panegyric at least for a century by their successors as the distinguished triumvirate of English poetry In the same Prologue the author says he was commanded to write this poem by the king No poet cotemporary with Caxton was of consequence enough to receive such a command and we know that Lydgate compiled many of his works by the direction or under the patronage of king Henry the fifth Lydgate was born in Suffolk and our author from the circumstance of having lived in a part of England not of a very polished dialect apologises for the rudeness of his language so that he cannot  delycately endyte  It is much in the style and manner of Lydgate and I believe it to have been one of his early performances  See supr vol ii p I know not if this is the poem recited by Stowe and called  "The Courte of Sapience in heaven for redemption of mankind"  Ubi supr col i    CHAP clxxii A king of England has two knights named  Guido and Tirius Guido having achieved many splendid exploits for the love of a beautiful lady at length married her Three days after his marriage he saw a vision which summoned him to engage in the holy war At parting she gave him a ring saying  "as often as you look on this ring remember me"  Soon after his departure she had a son After various adventures in which his friend Tirius has a share at the end of seven years he returned to England in the habit of a pilgrim Coming to his castle he saw at the gate his lady sitting and distributing alms to a croud of poor people ordering them all to pray for the return of her lord Guido from the holy land She was on that day accompanied by her son a little boy very beautiful and richly apparelled and who hearing his mother as she was distributing her alms perpetually recommending Guido to their prayers asked if that was his father Among others she gave alms to her husband Guido not knowing him in the pilgrim's disguise Guido seeing the little boy took him in his arms and kissed him saying  "O my sweet son may God give you grace to please him"  For this boldness he was reproved by the attendants But the lady finding him destitute and a stranger assigned him a cottage in a neighbouring forest Soon afterwards falling sick he said to his servant  "Carry this ring to your lady and tell her if she desires ever to see me again to come hither without delay"  The servant conveyed the ring but before she arrived he was dead She threw herself on his body and exclaimed with tears  "Where are now my alms which I daily gave for my lord I saw you receive those alms but I knew you notYou beheld embraced and kissed your own son but did not discover yourself to him nor to me What have I done that I shall see you no more"  She then interred him magnificently  The reader perceives this is the story of Guido or Guy earl of Warwick and probably this is the early outline of the life and death of that renowned champion  Many romances were at first little more than legends of devotion  containing the pilgrimage of an old warrior At length as chivalry came more into vogue and the stores of invention were increased the youthful and active part of the pilgrim's life was also written and a long series of imaginary martial adventures was added in which his religious was eclipsed by his heroic character and the penitent was lost in the knighterrant That which was the principal subject of the short and simple legend became only the remote catastrophe of the voluminous romance And hence by degrees it was almost an established rule of every romance for the knight to end his days in a hermitage Cervantes has ridiculed this circumstance with great pleasantry where Don Quixote holds a grave debate with Sancho whether he shall turn saint or archbishop  So reciprocal or rather so convertible was the pious and the military character that even some of the apostles had their romance In the ninth century the chivalrous and fabling spirit of the Spaniards transformed saint James into a knight They pretended that he appeared and fought with irresistible fury completely armed and mounted on a stately white horse in most of their engagements with the Moors and  cause by his superior prowess in these bloody conflicts he was supposed to have freed the Spaniards from paying the annual tribute of a hundred christian virgins to their infidel enemies they represented him as a professed and powerful champion of distressed damsels This apotheosis of chivalry in the person of their own apostle must have ever afterwards contributed to exaggerate the characteristical romantic heroism of the Spaniards by which it was occasioned and to propagate through succeeding ages a stronger veneration for that species of military enthusiasm to which they were naturally devoted It is certain that in consequence of these illustrious achievements in the Moorish wars saint James was constituted patron of Spain and became the founder of one of the most magnificent shrines and of the most opulent order of knighthood now existing in christendom  The Legend of this invincible apostle is inserted in the Mosarabic liturgy  CHAP clxxiii A king goes to a fair carrying in his train a master with one of his scholars who expose six bundles containing a system of ethics to sale  Compare

is in Alphonsus's CLERICALIS DISCIPLINA    About the year a collection of Latin fables in six books distinguished by the name of Esop was published in Germany The three first books consist of the sixty anonymous elegiac fables printed in Nevelet's collection under the title of  Anonymi Fabulae Aesopicae  and translated in by Wynkyn de Worde with a few variations under each is a fable in prose on the same subject from ROMULUS or the old prose LATIN  ESOP which was probably fabricated in the twelfth century The fourth book has the remaining fables of Romulus in prose only The fifth containing one or two fables only which were never called Esop's is taken from Alphonsus the GESTA ROMANORUM the CALILA U DAMNAH and other obscure sources The sixth and last book has seventeen fables ex  translatione Rinucii  that is Rinucius who translated Planudes's life of Esop and sixtynine of his fables from Greek into Latin in the fifteenth century This collection soon afterwards was circulated in a French version which Caxton translated into English  In an antient general Chronicle printed at Lubec in and entitled RUDIMENTUM NOVITIORUM  In this work th  following question is discussed originally I believe started by saint Austin and perhaps determined by Thomas Aquinas  An Angeli possi  t coir  cum Muli  rib    t generar  Gigantes  a short life of Esop is introduced

admitted to an audience with this magnificent earl and used to read to him a book of sonnets rondeaus and virelays written by a  gentyll  duke of Luxemburgh  Ibid col      In this age of curiosity distinguished for its love of historical anecdotes and the investigation of antient manners it is extraordinary that a new translation should not be made of Froissart from a collated and corrected original of the French Froissart is commonly ranked with romances but it ought to be remembered that he is the historian of a romantic age when those manners which form the fantastic books of chivalry were actually practised As he received his multifarious intelligence from such a variety of vouchers and of different nations and almost always collected his knowledge of events from report rather than from written or recorded evidence his notices of persons and places are frequently confused and unexact Many of these petty incorrectnesses are not however to be imputed to Froissart and it may seem surprising that there are not more inaccuracies of this kind in a voluminous chronicle treating of the affairs of England and abounding in English appellations composed by a Frenchman and printed in France Whoever will take the pains to compare this author with the coeval records in Rymer will find numerous instances of his truth and integrity in relating the more public and important transactions of his own times Why he should not have been honoured with a modern edition at the Louvre it is easy to conceive the French have a national prejudice against a writer who has been so much more complaisant to England than to their own country Upon the whole if Froissart should be neglected by the historical reader for his want of precision and authenticity he will at least be valued by the philosopher for his striking pictures of life drawn without reserve or affectation from real nature with a faithful and free pencil and by one who had the best opportunities of observation who was welcome alike to the feudal castle or the royal palace and who mingled in the bustle and business of the world at  hat very curious period of society when manners are very far refined and yet retain a considerable tincture of barbarism But I cannot better express my sentiments on this subject than in the words of Montaigne  "J'ayme les Historien  ou fort simples ou excellens Les simples qui n'ont point de quoy y mesler quelque chose du leur et qui n'y apportent que le soin et la diligence de ramasser tout ce qui vient a leur notice et d'enregistrer a la bonne foy toutes choses sans chois et sans triage nous laissent le jugement entier pour la conoissance de la verité Tel est entre autres pour example le bon Froissard qui a marchè en son enterprise d'une si franche naïfueté qu'ayant fait

fables and profane histories which they arbitrarily apply to the explication or confirmation of the mysteries of christianity He adds  "Hoc in studio excelluit quidam  Petrus Berchorius  Pictaviensis

commonly prefaced as in the GESTA with the introductory address of CARISSIMI In the colophon the GESTA is called  Ex gestis Romanorum  RECOLLECTORIUM a word much of a piece with his other titles of

upon an historical detail For  that most excellent historian Livy unequalled for the dignity brevity and  difficulty  of his style whose eloquence is so highly extolled by saint Jerome and whom I however unworthy have translated from Latin into French with great labour  I have mentioned this work before vol ii p It is remarkable that a copy of this manuscript in the British Museum is entitled

heard of in any nation besides But because I do not mean to treat of historical affairs in the present work the matter of which is entirely moral I refer the historical reader to Livy himself to Trogus Pompeius Justin Florus and Orosius who have all written histories of Rome as also to Innocent who in his book on the  Miseries of human nature  Pope Innocent the third about the year wrote

time we must remember that at this particular period the Roman history had become the grand object of the public taste in France The king himself as we have just seen recommended a translation of Livy French translations also of Sallust Cesar and Lucan were now circulated A Latin historical compilation called ROMULEON was now just published by a gentleman of France which was soon afterwards translated into French A collection of the GESTA ROMANORUM was therefore a popular subject at least it produced a popular title and was dictated by the fashion of the times  I have here mentioned all Berchorius's works except his Comment on a Prosody called  Doctrinale metricum  which was  used as a schoolbook in France till Despauterius's manual on that subject appeared  Oudin ubi supr  Some biographers mention his TROPOLOGIA his COSMOGRAPHIA and his BREVIARIUM But the TROPOLOGIA  I have seen a very old blackletter edition with the title  "Tropologiarum mysticarumque enarrationum c"

smaller pieces which they have not named or described Among these perhaps is comprehended the GESTA which we may conceive to have been thus undistinguished either as having been neglected or proscribed by graver writers or rather as having been probably disclaimed by its author who saw it at length in the light of a juvenile performance abounding in fantastic and unedifying narrations which he judged unsuitable to his character studies and station  Gesner adds reciting his works that he wrote  "alia multa"  EPITOM BIBL f b Tig fol And Trith  mius  "parvos sed multos tractatus"  De

the monastery of saint Eloy at Paris which is recited by Sweertius and on other accounts deserves a place here  HIC JACET VENERABILIS MAGNAE PROFUNDAEQUE SCIENTIAE ADMIRABILIS ET SUBTILIS ELOQUENTIAE

the Editions and there is no answering for the licentious innovations of transcribers CANT T vol iv    Berchorius was constituted grammatical preceptor to the novices of the Benedictine Congregation or monastery at Clugni in the year  Oudin ubi supr p  At which time he drew up his Notes on the Prosody and his Commentary on Ovid for the use of his scholars About the same time and with a view of rendering their exercises in Latinity more agreeable and easy by an entertaining Latin storybook yet resoluble into lessons of religion he probably compiled the GESTA perpetually addressing the application of every tale to his young audience by the paternal and affectionate appellation of CARISSIMI  This by habit and otherwise with no impropriety he seems to have retained in his later and larger works  There was therefore time enough for the GESTA to become a fashionable book of tales before Boccace published his DECAMERON The action of the DECAMERON being supposed in the year of the great pestilence we may safely conjecture that Boccace did not begin his work till after that period An exact and ingenious critic has proved that it was not finished till the year  See Tyrwhitt's CHAUCER iv seq    I have just observed that Berchorius probably compiled this work for the use of his grammatical pupils Were there not many good reasons for that supposition I should be induced to think that it might have been intended as a book of stories for the purpose of preachers I have already given instances that it was antiently fashionable for preachers to enforce the several moral duties by applying fables or exemplary narratives and in the present case the perpetual recurrence of the address of CARISSIMI might be brought in favour of this hypothesis But I will here suggest an additional reason Soon after the age of  Berchorius a similar collection of stories of the same cast was compiled though not exactly in the same form professedly designed for sermon writers and by one who was himself an eminent preacher for rather before the year a Latin volume was printed in Germany written by John Herolt a Dominican friar of Basil better known by the adopted and humble appellation of DISCIPULUS and who flourished about the year It consists of three parts The first is entitled  "Incipiunt Sermones pernotabiles DISCIPULI de Sanctis per anni circulum"  That is a set of Sermons on the Saints of the whole year The second part and with which I am now chiefly concerned is a PROMPTUARY or ample repository of examples for composing sermons and in the Prologue to this part the author says that saint Dominic always  abundabat exemplis  in his discourses and that he constantly practiced this popular mode of edification This part contains a variety of little histories Among others are the following Chaucer's Friar's tale Aristotle falling in love with a queen who compels him to permit her to ride upon his back  EXEMPL lxvii Sub litera M  "De regina quae equitavit Aristotelem"  He cites Jacobus de Vitriaco See supr p xix  The boy who was kept in a dark cave till he was twelve years of age and who being carried abroad and presented with many striking objects preferred a woman to all he had seen  EXEMPL xxiv Sub Litera L  A boy educated in a desert is brought into a city where he sees a woman whom he is taught to call a fine bird under the name of a goose and on his return into the desert desires his spiritual father to kill him a goose for his dinner  Ibid EXEMPL xxiii See supr p l  These two last stories Boccace has worked into one The old woman and her little dog  EXEMPL xii Sub lit V  This as we have seen is in the GESTA ROMANORUM  CH xxviii  The son who will not shoot at his father's dead body  This is also in the GESTA CH xlvEXEMPL viii Lit B  I give these as specimens of the collection The third part contains  stories for sermon writers consisting only of select miracles of the Virgin Mary The first of these is the tale of the chast  Roman empress occurring in the Harleian manuscripts of the GESTA and versified by Occleve yet with some variation  See supr p lxxxiii  This third part is closed with these words which also end the volume  "Explicit tabula Exemplorum in tractatulo de Exemplis gloriose Virginis Marie contentorum"  I quote from the first edition which is a clumsy folio in a rude Gothic letter in two volumes and without pagings signatures or initials The place and year are also wanting but it was certainly printed before  For the second edition is at Nuremburgh fol Others followed before  and probably at Nuremburgh The same author also wrote a set of sermons called  Sermones de tempore  The only edition I have seen with the addition of the S  MONES DE SANCTIS and the PROMPTUARIUM EXEMPLORUM abovementioned was printed by M Fl  cius Argentin fol But there is an earlier edition At the close of the last Sermon he tells us why he chose to be styled DISCI  ULUS Because  "non subtilia per modum MAGI  TRI sed simplicia per modum DISCIPULI conscripsi et collegi"  I have seen also early impressions of his SERMONES QUADRAGESIMALES and of other pieces of the same sort All his works were published together in three volumes Mogunt to The EXAMPLES appeared separately Daventr Colon Argentorat Hagen fol  In these I find  SERM cxxi col ii Signat C  Alphonsus's story which in the GESTA ROMANORUM is the tale of the two knights of Egypt and Baldach  CH clxxi  and in Boccace's DECAMERON the history of TITO and GESIPPO Parnell's HERMIT  SERM liii  and the apologue of the king's brother who had heard the trumpet of Death  SERM cix  both which last are also in the GESTA  CH lxxx cxliii  Such are the revolutions of taste and so capricious the modes of composition that a Latin homilybook of a German monk in the fifteenth century should exhibit outlines of the tales of Boccace Chaucer and Parnell  It may not be thought impertinent to close this discourse with a remark on the MORALISATIONS subjoined to the stories of the GESTA ROMANORUM This was an age of vision and mystery and every work was believed to contain a double or  secondary meaning Nothing escaped this eccentric spirit of refinement and abstraction and together with the bible as we have seen not only the general history of antient times was explained allegorically but even the poetical fictions of the classics were made to signify the great truths of religion with a degree of boldness and a want of a discrimination which in another age would have acquired the character of the most profane levity if not of absolute impiety and can only be defended from the simplicity of the state of knowledge which then prevailed  Thus God creating man of clay animated with the vital principle of respiration was the story of Prometheus wh  formed a man of similar materials to which he communicated life by fire stolen from heaven Christ twice born of his father God and of his mother Mary was prefigured by Bacchus who was first born of Semele and afterwards of Jupiter And as Minerva sprung from the brain of Jupiter so Christ proceeded from God without a mother Christ born of the Virgin Mary was expressed in the fable of Danae shut within a tower through the covering of which Jupiter descended in a shower of gold and begot Perseus Acteon killed by his own hounds was a type of the persecution and death of our Saviour The poet Lycophron relates that Hercules in returning from the adventure of the Golden Fleece was shipwrecked and that being devoured by a monstrous fish he was disgorged alive on the shore after three days Here was an obvious symbol of Christ's resurrection John Waleys an English Fr  nciscan of the thirteenth century in his moral exposition of Ovid's Metamorphoses  I have before mentioned Berchorius's OVID MORALISED  affords many other instances equally ridiculous and who forgot that he was describing a more heterrogeneous chaos than that which makes so conspicuous a figure in his author's exordium and which combines amid the monstrous and indigested aggregate of its unnatural associations  Sine pondere habentia pondus  M  TAM L i    At length compositions professedly allegorical with which that age abounded were resolved into allegories for which they were never intended In the famous ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE written about the year the poet couches the difficulties of an ardent lover in attaining the object of his passion under the allegory of a Rose which is gathered in a delicious but almost inaccessible garden The theologists proved this rose to be the white rose of Jericho the new Jerusalem a state of grace divine wisdom the holy Virgin or eternal beatitude at none of which obstinate heretics can ever arrive The chemists pretended that it was the philosopher's stone the civilians that it was the most consummate point of equitable decision and the physicians that it was an infallible panacea In a word other professions in the most elaborate commentaries explained away the lover's rose into the mysteries of their own respective science In conformity to this practice Tasso allegorised his own poem and a flimsy structure of morality was raised on the chimerical conceptions of Ariosto's ORLANDO In the year a translation of a part of Amadis de Gaule appeared in France with a learned preface developing the valuable stores of profound instruction concealed under the naked letter of the old romances which were discernible only to the intelligent and totally unperceived by common readers who instead of plucking the fruit were obliged to rest contented with  le simple  FLEUR  de la Lecture litterale  Even Spenser at a later period could not indulge his native impulse to descriptions of chivalry without framing such a story as conveyed under the  dark conceit  of ideal champions a set of historic transactions and an exemplification of the nature of the twelve moral virtues He presents his fantastic queen with a rich romantic mirrour which shewed the wonderous achievements of her magnificent ancestry  And thou O fairest princess under sky  In this fayre mirrour maist behold thy face  And thine own realmes in Lond of Faery  And in this antique image thy great ancestry  B ii INTROD St vi    It was not however solely from an unmeaning and a wanton spirit of refinement that the fashion of resolving every thing into allegory so universally prevailed The same apology may be offered for the cabalistical interpreters both of the classics and of the old romances The former not willing that those books should be quite exploded which contained the antient mythology laboured to reconcile the apparent absurdities of the pagan system to the christian mysteries by demonstrating a figurative resemblance The latter as true learning began to dawn with a view of supporting for a while the expiring credit of giants and magicians were compelled to palliate those monstrous incredibilities by a bold attempt to unravel the mystic web which had been wove by fairy hands and by shewing that truth was hid under the gorgeous veil of Gothic invention  THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY  SECT XIX  OUR communications and intercourse with Italy which began to prevail about the beginning of the sixteenth century not only introduced the studies of classical literature into England but gave a new turn to our vernacular poetry At this period Petrarch still continued the most favorite poet of the Italians and had established a manner which was universally adopted and imitated by his ingenious countrymen In the mean time the courts both of France and England were distinguished for their elegance Francis the first had changed the state of letters in France by mixing gallantry with learning and by admitting the ladies to his court in company with the ecclesiastics  See supr vol ii p  His carousals were celebrated with a brilliancy and a festivity unknown to the ceremonious shews of former princes Henry the eighth vied with Francis in these gaieties His ambition which could not bear a rival even in diversions  was seconded by liberality of disposition and a love of ostentation For Henry with many boisterous qualities was magnificent and affable Had he never murthered his wives his politeness to the fair sex would remain unimpeached His martial sports were unincumbered by the barbaric pomp of the antient chivalry and softened by the growing habits of more rational manners He was attached to those spectacles and public amusements in which beauty assumed a principal share and his frequent masques and tournaments encouraged a high spirit of romantic courtesy Poetry was the natural accompaniment of these refinements Henry himself was a leader and a chief character in these pageantries and at the same time a reader and a writer of verses The language and the manners of Italy were esteemed and studied The sonnets of Petrarch were the great models of composition They entered into the genius of the fashionable manners and in a court of such a complexion Petrach of course became the popular poet Henry Howard earl Surrey with a mistress perhaps as beautiful as Laura and at least with Petrarch's passion if not his taste led the way to great improvements in English poetry by a happy imitation of Petrarch and other Italian poets who had been most successful in painting the anxieties of love with pathos and propriety  Lord Surrey's life throws so much light on the character and subjects of his poetry that it is almost impossible to consider the one without exhibiting a few anecdotes of the other He was the son and grandson of two lords treasurers dukes of Norfolk and in his early childhood discovered the most promising marks of lively parts and an active mind  While a boy he was habituated to the modes of a court at Windsorcastle where he resided yet under the care of proper instructors in the quality of a companion to Henry Fitzroy duke of Richmond a natural son of king Henry the eighth and of the highest expectations  This young nobleman who also bore other titles and honours was the child of Henry's affection not so much on account of  hi  hopeful abilities as for a reason insinuated by lord Herbert and at which those who know Henry's history and character will not be surprised because he equally and strongly resembled both his father and mother  A friendship of the closest kind commencing between these two illustrious youths about the year they were both removed to cardinal Wolsey's college at Oxford then universally frequented as well for the excellence as the novelty of its institution for it was one of the first seminaries of an English university that professed to explode the pedantries of the old barbarous philosophy and to cultivate the graces of polite literature Two years afterwards for the purpose of acquiring every accomplishment of an elegant education the earl accompanied his noble friend and fellowpupil into France where they received king Henry on his arrival at Calais to visit Francis the first with a most magnificent retinue The frienship of these two young noblemen was soon strengthened by a new tie for Richmond married the lady Mary Howard Surrey's sister Richmond however appears to have died in the year about the age of seventeen having never cohabited with his wife  Wood ATH OXON i  It was long before Surrey forgot the untimely loss of this amiable youth the friend and associate of his childhood and who nearly resembled himself in genius refinement of manners and liberal acquisitions  The FAIR GERALDINE the general object of lord Surrey's passionate sonnets is commonly said to have lived at Florence and to have been of the family of the Gera  i of that city This is a mistake yet not entirely without grounds propagated by an easy misapprehension of an expression in one of our poet's odes and a passage in Drayton's heroic epistles She was undoubtedly one of the daughters of Gerald Fitzgerald earl of Kildare But it will be necessary to transcribe what our author himself has said of this celebrated lady The history of one  who caused so memorable and so poetical a passion naturally excites curiosity and will justify an investigation which on many a similar occasion would properly be censured as frivolous and impertinent  From Tuskane came my ladies worthy race  Faire Florence was sumtyme her  i e their  auncient seat  The westerne yle whose plesant shore doth face  Wild Camber's cliffs did gyve her lively heate  Fostred she was with milke of Irishe brest  Her sire an earle her dame of princes blood  From tender yeres in Britain she doth rest  With kinges child where she tasteth costly food  Hunsdon did first present her to mine yien  Bright is her hewe and Geraldine she hight  Hampton me taught to wish her first mine  And Windsor alas doth chase me from her sight  Fol edit    These notices it must be confessed are obscure and indirect But a late elegant biographer has with the most happy sagacity solved the difficulties of this little enigmatical ode which had been before either neglected and unattempted as inexplicable or rendered  more unintelligible by false conjectures I readily adopt Mr Walpole's key to the genealogy of the matchless Geraldine  CATAL Roy and Noble Authors vol i p edit    Her poetical appellation is almost her real name Gerald Fitzgerald abovementioned earl of Kildare in the reign of Henry the eighth married a second wife Margaret daughter of Thomas Gray marquis of Dorset by whom he had three daughters Margaret Elisabeth and Cicely Margaret was born deaf and dumb and a lady who could neither hear nor answer her lover and who wanted the means of contributing to the most endearing reciprocations can hardly be supposed to have  been the cause of any vehement effusions of amorous panegyric We may therefore safely pronounce Elisabeth or Cicely to have been Surrey's favorite It was probably Elisabeth as she seems always to have lived in England  Every circumstance of the sonnet evidently coincides with this state of the case But to begin with the first line it will naturally be asked what was lady Elisabeth Gerald's connection with Tuscany The beginnings of noble families like those of nations often owe somewhat to fictitious embellishment and our genealogists uniformly assert that the family of Fitzgerald derives its origin from Otho a descendant of the dukes of Tuscany that they migrated into England under the reign of king Alfred whose annals are luckily too scanty to contradict such an account and were from England speedily transplanted into Ireland Her father was an Irish earl resident at his earldom of Kildare and she was consequently born and nursed in Ireland Her mother adds the sonnet was of princely parentage Here is a no less exact correspondence with the line of the lady's pedigree for Thomas marquis of Dorset was son of queen Elisabeth Gray daughter of the duchess of Bedford descended from the royal house of Luxemburgh The poet acquaints us that he first saw her at Hunsdon This notice which seems of an indifferent nature and quite extraneous to the question abundantly corroborates our conjecture Hundsdonhouse in Hertfordshire was a new palace built by Henry the eighth and chiefly for the purpose of educating his children The lady Elisabeth Fitzgerald was second cousin to Henry's daughters the princesses Mary and Elisabeth who were both educated at Hunsdon  Strype ECCL MEM vol i APPEND Numb  At this royal nursery she therefore  tasted of costly foode with kinges childe  that is lived while a girl with the young princesses her relations as a companion in their education At the same time and on the same plan our earl of Surrey resided at Windsorcastle as I have already remarked with the young  duke of Richmond It is natural to suppose that he sometimes visited the princesses at Hunsdon in company with the young duke their brother where he must have also seen the fair Geraldine yet by the nature of his situation at Windsor which implied a degree of confinement he was hindered from visiting her at Hunsdon so often as he wished He therefore pathetically laments  Windsor alas doth chase me from her sight  But although the earl first beheld this lady at the palace of Hunsdon yet as we further learn from the sonnet he was first struck with her incomparable beauty and his passion commenced at Hamptoncourt  Hampton me taught to wish her first for mine  That is and perhaps on occasion of some splendid masque or carousal when the lady Elisabeth Fitzgerald with the princesses Mary and Elisabeth and their brother Richmond with the young lord Surrey were invited by the king to Hamptoncourt  In the mean time we must remember that the lord Leonard Gray uncle to lord Gerald Fitzgerald was deputy of Ireland for the young duke of Richmond a connection exclusive of all that has been said which would alone account for Surrey's acquaintance at least with this lady It is also a reason to say no more why the earl should have regarded her from the first with a particular attention which afterwards grew into the most passionate attachment She is supposed to have been Maid of honour to queen Catharine But there are three of Henry's queens of that name For obvious reasons however we may venture to say that queen Catharine Howard was Geraldine's queen  It is not precisely known at what period the earl of Surrey began his travels They have the air of a romance He made the tour of Europe in the true spirit of chivalry and with the  ideas of an Amadis proclaiming the unparalleled charms of his mistress and prepared to defend the cause of her beauty with the weapons of knighterrantry Nor was this adventurous journey performed without the intervention of an enchanter The first city in Italy which he proposed to visit was Florence the capital of Tuscany and the original seat of the ancestors of his Geraldine In his way thither he passed a few days at the emperor's court where he became acquainted with Cornelius Agrippa a celebrated adept in natural magic This visionary philosopher shewed our hero in a mirror of glass a living image of Geraldine reclining on a couch sick and reading one of his most tender sonnets by a waxen taper  Drayton HER EPISTHOWARD to GERALDINE v  His imagination which wanted not the flattering representations and artificial incentives of illusion was heated anew by this interesting and affecting spectacle Inflamed with every enthusiasm of the most romantic passion he hastened to Florence and on his arrival immediately published a defiance against any person who could handle a lance and was in love whether Christian Jew Turk Saracen or Canibal who should presume to dispute the superiority of Geraldine's beauty As the lady was pretended to be of Tuscan extraction the pride of the Florentines was flattered on this occasion and the grand duke of Tuscany permitted a general and unmolested ingress into his dominions of the combatants of all countries till this important trial should be decided The challenge was accepted and the earl victorious  Wood ubi supr  The shield which he presented to the duke before the tournament began is exhibited in Vertue's valuable plate of the Arundel family and was actually in the possession of the late duke of Norfolk  Walpole AN  CD PAINT i    These heroic vanities did not however so totally engross the time which Surrey spent in Italy as to alienate his mind from letters he studied with the greatest success a critical knowledge  of the Italian tongue and that he might give new lustre to the name of Geraldine attained a just taste for the peculiar graces of the Italian poetry  He was recalled to England for some idle reason by the king much sooner than he expected and he returned home the most elegant traveller the most polite lover the most learned nobleman and the most accomplished gentleman of his age Dexterity in tilting and gracefulness in managing a horse under arms were excellencies now viewed with a critical eye and practised with a high degree of emulation In at a tournament held in the presence of the court at Westminster and in which the principal of the nobility were engaged Surrey was distinguished above the rest for his address in the use and exercise of arms But his martial skill was not solely displayed in the parade and ostentation of these domestic combats In he marched into Scotland as a chief commander in his father's army and was conspicuous for his conduct and bravery at the memorable battle of Floddenfield where James the fourth of Scotland was killed The next year we find the career of his victories impeded by an obstacle which no valour could resist The censures of the church have humiliated the greatest heroes and he was imprisoned in Windsorcastle for eating flesh in Lent The prohibition had been renewed or strengthened by a recent proclamation of the king I mention this circumstance  not only as it marks his character impatient of any controul and careless of very serious consequences which often arise from a contempt of petty formalities but as it gave occasion to one of his most sentimental and pathetic sonnets  Fol  In he was fieldmarshal of the English army in the expedition to Bologne which he took In that age love and arms constantly went together and it was amid the fatigues of this protracted campaign that he composed his last sonnet called the FANSIE of a  wearied Lover  Fol See Dudg  BARONAG  ii p    But as Surrey's popularity encreased his interest declined with the king whose caprices and jealousies grew more violent with his years and infirmities The brilliancy of Surrey's character his celebrity in the military science his general abilities his wit learning and affability were viewed by Henry with disgust and suspicion It was in vain that he possessed every advantageous qualification which could adorn the scholar the courtier and the soldier In proportion as he was amiable in the eyes of the people he became formidable to the king His rising reputation was misconstrued into a dangerous ambition and gave birth to accusations equally groundless and frivolous  He was suspected of a design to marry the princess Mary and by that alliance of approaching to a possibility of wearing the crown It was insinuated that he conversed with foreigners and held a correspondence with cardinal Pole  The addition of the escocheon of Edward the Confessor to his own although used by the family of Norfolk for many years and justified by the authority of the heralds was a sufficient foundation for an impeachment of high treason These motives were privately aggravated by those prejudices with which Henry remembered the misbehaviour of Catharine Howard and which were extended to all that lady's relations At length the earl of Surrey fell a sacrifice to the peevish injustice of a merciless and ungrateful master Notwithstanding his eloquent and masculine defence which even in the cause of guilt itself would have proved a powerful persuasive he was condemned by the prepared suffrage of a servile and obsequious jury and beheaded on Towerhill in the year  See Stowe CHRON  p Challoner de REPUBL ANGL INSTAURAND  lib ii  p  In the mean time we should remember that Surrey's public conduct was not on all occasions quite unexceptionable In the affair of Bologne he had made a false step This had offended the king But Henry when once offended could never forgive And when Hertford was sent into France to take the command he could not refrain from  dropping some reproachful expressions against a measure which seemed to impeach his personal courage Conscious of his high birth and capacity he was above the little attentions of caution and reserve and he too frequently neglected to consult his own situation and the king's temper It was his misfortune to serve a monarch whose resentments which were easily provoked could only be satisfied by the most severe revenge Henry brought those men to the block which other monarchs would have only disgraced  Among these anecdotes of Surrey's life I had almost forgot to mention what became of his amour with the fair Geraldine We lament to find that Surrey's devotion to this lady did not end in a wedding and that all his gallantries and verses availed so little No memoirs of that incurious age have informed us whether her beauty was equalled by her cruelty or whether her ambition prevailed so far over her gratitude as to tempt her to prefer the solid glories of a more splendid title and ample fortune to the challenges and the compliments of so magnanimous so faithful and so eloquent a lover She appears however to have been afterwards the third wife of Edward Clinton earl of Lincoln Such also is the power of time and accident over amorous vows that even Surrey himself outlived the violence of his passion He married Frances daughter of John earl of Oxford by whom he left several children One of his daughters Jane countess of Westmoreland was among the learned ladies of that age and became famous for her knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages  Dugd BARON i ii    Surrey's poems were in high reputation with his cotemporaries and for many years afterwards He is thus characterised by the author of the old ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE whose opinion remained long as a rule of criticism  "In the latter end of the same kinges Henry raigne spronge up a new company of courtly makers of whom sir Thomas Wyat the  elder and Henry earle of Surrey were the two CHIEFTAINES who having travailed into Italie and there tasted the sweete and stately measured and stile of the Italian poesie as novices newly crept out of the schooles of Dante Ariosto and Petrarch they greatly polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poesie from that it had bene before and for that cause may justly be sayd the first reformers of our English meeter and stile  Lib i ch xxxi p edit  "  And again towards the close of the same chapter  "Henry earle of Surrey and sir Thomas Wyat between whom I finde very little difference I repute them as before for the two chief lanternes of light to all others that have since employed their pennes upon English poesie their conceits were loftie their stiles stately their conveyance cleanly their termes proper their

and Drayton Nor have these pieces although scarcely known at present been without the panegyric of more recent times Surrey is praised by Waller and Fenton and he seems to have been a favorite with Pope Pope in WINDSORFOREST having compared his patron lord Granville with Surrey he was immediately reprinted but without attracting many readers  By Sewell Reprinted by Curl ib  It was vainly imagined that all the world would eagerly wish to purchase the works of a neglected antient English poet whom Pope had called  the  GRANVILLE  of a former age  So rapid are the revolutions of our language and such the uncer  ainty of literary fame that Philips Milton's nephew who wrote about the year has remarked that in his time Surrey's poetry was antiquated and totally forgotten  TH  ATR PO  TAR p edit mo    Our authors SONGES AND SONNETTES as they have been stiled were first collected and printed at London by Tottell  in  In quarto It is extraordinary that A Wood should not have known this edition Another edition appeared in Others in Others appeared afterwards  As it happens in collections of this kind they are of various merit Surrey is said by the ingenious author of the MUSES LIBRARY to have been the first who broke through the fashion of stanzas and wrote in the heroic couplet But all Surrey's poems are in the alternate rhyme nor had this been true is the other position to be granted Chaucer's Prologues and most of the Canterbury Tales are written in long verse nor was the use of the couplet resumed till late in the reign of Elisabeth  In the sonnets of Surrey we are surprised to find nothing of that metaphysical cast which marks the Italian poets his supposed masters especially Petrarch Surrey's sentiments are for the most part natural and unaffected arising from his own feelings and dictated by the present circumstances His poetry is alike unembarrassed by learned allusions or elaborate conceits If our author copies Petrarch it is Petrarch's better manner when he descends from his Platonic abstractions his refinements of passion his exaggerated compliments and his play upon opposite sentiments into a track of tenderness simplicity and nature Petrarch would have been a better poet had he been a worse scholar Our author's mind was not too much overlaid by learning  The following is the poem abovementioned in which he laments his imprisonment in Windsorcastle But it is rather an elegy than a sonnet  So cruel prison how coulde betyde alas  As proude Windsor  How could the stately cas  le of Windsor become so miserable a prison  where I in lust and joye  In unrestrained gaiety and pleasure    With a kynges sonne  With the young duke of Richmond  my childishe yeres did passe  In greater feast than Priam's sonnes of Troye  Where eche swete place returnes a taste full sower  The large grene courtes where we were wont to hove  To hover to loiter in expectation So Chaucer TROIL CRESS B ver  But at the yate there she should outride  With certain folk he  lovid  her t' abide    With eyes cast up into the mayden's tower  Swift's joke about the Maids of honour being lodged at Windsor in the round tower in queen Anne's time is too well known and too indelicate to be repeated here But in the present instance Surrey speaks loosely and poetically in making the MAIDENTOWER the true reading the residence of the women The maidentower was common in other castles and means the principal tower of the greatest strength and defence MAIDEN is a corruption of the old French  Mag  e  or  Mayne  great Thus Maidenhead properly Maydenhithe in Berkshire signifies the  great  port or wharf on the river Thames So also  MaydenBradley  in Wiltshire is the  great Bradley  The old Roman camp near Dorchester in Dorsetshire a noble work is called  Maiden castle  the capital fortress in those parts We have Maidendown in Somertsetshire with the same signification A thousand other instances might be given Hearne not attending to this etymology absurdly supposes in one of his Prefaces that a strong bastion in the old walls of the city of Oxford called the MAIDENTOWER was a prison for con  ining the prostitu  es of the town    And easie sighes such as men drawe in love  The stately seates the ladies bright of hewe  The daunces shorte long tales of great delight  With wordes and lookes that tigers could but rewe  Pity    Where ech of us did pleade the others right  The palmeplay  At ball  where dispoyled for the game  Rendered unfit or unable to play    With dazed yies  Dazzled eyes  oft we by gleames of love  Have mist the ball and got sight of our dame  To bayte  To tempt to catch  her eyes which kept the leads above  The ladies were ranged on the lead  or battlements of the castle to see the play    The gravell grounde  The ground or are  was strown with gravel  where they were trained in chivalry  with sleves tied on the helme  At tournaments they  ixed the  leeves of their mistresses on some part of their armour    On fomyng horse with swordes and frendly hartes  With cheare  Looks  as though one should another whelme  Destroy    Where we have fought and chased oft with dartes  The secret groves which ofte we

To banish th' lesse I find my chief releefe  Fol    In the poet's situation nothing can be more natural and striking than the reflection with which he opens his complaint There is also much beauty in the abruptness of his exordial exclamation The superb palace where he had passed the most pleasing days of his youth with the son of a king was now converted into a tedious and solitary prison This unexpected vicissitude of fortune awakens a new and interesting train of thought The comparison of his past and present circumstances recals their juvenile sports and amusements which were more to be regretted as young Richmond was now dead Having described some of these with great elegance he recurs to his first idea by a beautiful apostrophe He appeals to the place of his confinement once the source of his highest pleasures  "O place of bliss renewer of my woe  And where is now my noble friend my companion is these delights who was once your  inhabitant Echo alone either pities or answers my question and returns a plaintive hollow sound"  He closes his complaint with an affecting and pathetic sentiment much in the style of Petrarch  "To banish the miseries of my present distress I am forced on the wretched expedient of remembering a greater"  This is the consolation of a warm fancy It is the philosophy of poetry  Some of the following stanzas on a lover who presumed to compare his lady with the divine Geraldine have almost the ease and gallantry of Waller The leading compliment which has been used by later writers is in the spirit of an Italian fiction It is very ingenious and handled with a high degree of elegance  Give place ye Lovers here before  That spent your bostes and bragges in vaine  My Ladie's bewty passeth more  The best of yours I dare wel saine  Than doth the sunne the candle light  Or brightest day the darkest night  And therto hath a troth as just  As had Penelope the faire  For what she sayth ye may it trust  As it by writing sealed were  And vertues hath she many moe  Than I with pen have skill to showe  I could reherse if that I would  The whole effect of NATURE'S plaint  When she had lost the perfite mould  The like to whom she could not paint  With wringyng handes how she did cry  And what she said I know it I  I knowe she swore with ragyng minde  Her kingdom only set apart  There was no losse by lawe of kinde  That could have gone so neare her hart  And this was chefely all her paine  She could not make the like againe  Fol    The versification of these stanzas is correct the language polished and the modulation musical The following stanza of another ode will hardly be believed to have been produced in the reign of Henry the eighth  Spite drave me into Boreas' raigne  Her anger drove me into a colder climate    Where hory frostes the frutes do bite  When hilles were spred and every plaine  With stormy winter's mantle white  Fol    In an Elegy on the elder sir Thomas Wyat's death his character is delineated in the following nervous and manly quatraines  A visage sterne and mylde where both did growe  Vice to contemne in vertue to rejoyce  Amid great stormes whom grace assured so  To live upright and smile at fortune's choyce  A toung that serv'd in forein realmes his king  Whose courteous talke to vertue did enflame  Eche noble hart a worthy guide to bring  Our English youth by travail unto fame  An eye whose judgement none affect  Passion  could blind  Friends to allure and foes to reconcile  Whose persing  Piercing  looke did represent a minde  With virtue fraught reposed voyd of gile  A hart where dreade was never so imprest  To hide the thought that might the truth advance  In neither fortune lost nor yet represt  To swell in welth or yeld unto mischance  Fol    The following lines on the same subject are remarkable  Divers thy deth do diversly bemone  Some that in presence of thy livelyhede  Lurked whose brestes envy with hate had swolne  Yeld Cesar's teares upon Pompeius' head  Fol    There is great dignity and propriety in the following Sonnet on Wyat's PSALMS  The Macedon that out of Persia chased  Darius of whose power all Asia rong  In the riche arke  Chest  Dan Homer's rimes

passages in his  Description of the restlesse state of a Lover  are pictures of the heart and touched with delicacy  I wish for night more covertly to plaine  And me withdrawe from every haunted place  Lest by my chere  Behaviour Looks  my chance appeare too plaine  And in my mynde I mesure pace by pace  To seke the place where I myself had lost  That day when I was tangled in the lace  In seming

Unto myself unlesse this carefull song  Print in your hart some parcel of my tene  Sorrow    For I alas in sil  nce all too long  Of mine old hurt yet fele the wound but grene  Fol    Surrey's talents which are commonly supposed to have been confined to sentiment and amorous lamentation were adapted to descriptive poetry and the representations of rural imagery A writer only that viewed the beauties of nature with poetic eyes could have selected the vernal objects which compose the following exquisite ode  Fol    The soote season that bud and blome forth brings  With grene hath clad the hill and eke the val    The nightingale with fethers new she sings  The turtle to her mate hath told her tale  Somer is come for every spray now springs  The hart hath hong his old hed on the pale  The buck in brake his winter coate he flings  The fishes flete with new repayred scale  The adder all her slough away she flings  The swift swalow pursueth the flies smale  The busy bee her hony now she mings  Winter is worne that was the flowers bale  Destruction    I do not recollect a more faithful and finished version of Martial's HAPPY LIFE than the following  MARTIAL the thinges that doe attain  The happy life be these I finde  The richesse left not got with pain  The fruitfull grounde the quiet minde  The equall frend no grudge no strife  No charge of rule nor governaunce  Without disease the healthful life  The houshold of continuance  The diet meane  Moder  te  no delicate fare  Trewe wisdom joynde with simplenesse  The night discharged of all care  Where wine the wit may not oppresse  The faithful wife without debate  Such slepes as may begile the night  Contented with thine owne estate  Ne wish for death ne feare his might  Fol    But Surrey was not merely the poet of idleness and gallantry He was fitted both from nature and study for the more solid and laborious parts of literature He translated the second and fourth books of Virgil into blank verse  They were first printed in mo  and it seems probable that  his active situations of life prevented him from completing a design of translating the whole Eneid  This is the first composition in blank verse extant in the English language Nor has it merely the relative and accidental merit of being a curiosity It is executed with great fidelity yet not with a prosaic servility The diction is often poetical and the versification varied with proper pauses This is the description of Dido and Eneas going to the field in the fourth book  At the threshold of her chaumberdore  The Carthage lords did on the Quene attend  The trampling steed with gold and purple trapt  Chawing the foming bit ther fercely stood  Then issued she awayted with great train  Clad in a cloke of Tyre embrawderd riche  Her

of Surrey Felice Figlinei a Sanese and Surrey's cotemporary in his admirable Italian commentary on the ETHICS of Aristotle entitled FILOSOSIA MORALE SOPRA IL LIBRI D' ETHICA D'ARISTOTILE declaims against the barbarity of rhyme and strongly recommends a total rejection of this Gothic ornament to his countrymen He enforces his precept by his own example and translates all Aristotle's quotations from Homer and Euripides into verse without rhyme Gonsalvo Perez the learned secretary to Philip of Spain had also recently translated Homer's Odyssey into Spanish blankverse How much the excellent Roger Ascham approved of Surrey's disuse of rhyme in this translation from Virgil appears from the following passage in his SCHOLEMASTER written about the year  I know of no English critic besides who has mentioned Surrey's Virgil except Bolton a great reader of old English books HYPERCRIT p Oxon    "The noble lord Thomas earle of Surrey FIRST OF ALL ENGLISHMEN in translating the fourth and second

revival of the Greek and Roman poets in Italy excited all the learned men of that country to copy the Roman versification and consequently banished the old Leonine Latin verse The same classical idea operated in some degree on the vernacular poetry of Italy In the year Trissino published his ITALIA LIBERATA DI GOTI or ITALY DELIVERED FROM THE GOTHS an heroic poem professedly written in imitation of the Iliad without either rhyme or the usual machineries of the Gothic romance Trissino's design was to destroy the TERZA RIMA of Dante We do not however find whether it be from the facility with which the Italian tongue falls into rhyme or that the best and established Italian poets wrote in the stanza that these efforts to restore blankverse produced any lasting effects in the progress of the Italian poetry It is very probable that this specimen of the Eneid in blankverse by Surrey led the way to Abraham Fleming's blankverse translation of Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics although done in Alexandrines published in the year  London to    Lord Surrey wrote many other English poems which were never  published and are now perhaps entirely lost He translated the ECCLESIASTES of Solomon

with the highest commendations many translations done by Surrey from the Latin Italian French and  Spanish languages But these it is probable were  othing more than juvenile exercises  Surrey for his justness of thought correctness of style and purity of expression may justly be pronounced the first English classical poet He unquestionably is the first polite writer of loveverses in our language It must however be allowed that there is a striking native beauty in some of our loveverses written much earlier than Surrey's But in the most savage ages and countries rude nature has taught elegance to the lover  SECT XX  WITH Surrey's Poems Tottel has joined in his editions of and the SONGES and SONNETTES of sir Thomas Wyat the elder  Wyat's begin at fol  and of Uncertain Auctours  Wyat was of Allingtoncastle in Kent which he magnificently repaired and educated in both our universities But his chief and most splendid accomplishments were derived from his travels into various parts of Europe which he frequently visited in the quality of an envoy He was endeared to king Henry the eighth who did not always act from caprice for his fidelity and success in the execution of public business his skill in arms literature familiarity with languages and lively conversation Wood who degrades every thing by poverty of style and improper representations says that  "the king was in a high manner delighted with his  witty jests  ATH OXON i  "  It is not perhaps improbable that Henry was as much pleased with his repartees as his politics He is reported to have occasioned the reformation by a joke and to have planned the fall of cardinal Wolsey by a seasonable story  S  e MISCELLANEOUS ANTIQUITIES Numb ii pag Printed at Strawberryhill to  But he had almost lost his popularity either from an intimacy with queen Anne Boleyn which was called a connection or the gloomy cabals of bishop Bonner who could not bear his political superiority Yet his prudence and integrity no less than the powers of his oratory justified his innocence He laments his severe and unjust imprisonment on that trying occasion in a sonnet addressed to sir Francis Bryan insinuating his sollicitude that although the wound would be healed the scar would  remain and that to be acquitted of the accusation would avail but little while the thoughts of having been accused were still fresh in remembrance  Fol  It is a common mistake that he died abroad of the plague in an embassy to Charles the fifth Being sent to conduct that emperor's embassador from Falmouth to London from too eager and a needless desire of executing his commission with dispatch and punctuality he caught a fever by riding in a hot day and in his return died on the road at Shirburn where he was buried in the great conventual church in the year The next year Leland published a book of Latin verses on his death with a wooden print of his head prefixed probably done by Holbein  NAEN  AE  in mortem T Viati  Lond to See also Leland's ENCOM  p  It will be superfluous to transcribe the panegyrics of his cotemporaries after the encomium of lord Surrey in which his amiable character owes more to truth than to the graces of poetry or to the flattery of friendship  We must agree with a critic above quoted that Wyat cooperated with Surry in having corrected the roughness of our poetic style But Wyat although sufficiently distinguished from the common versifiers of his age is confessedly inferior to Surrey in harmony of numbers perspicuity of expression and facility of phraseology Nor is he equal to Surrey in elegance of sentitiment in nature and sensibility His feelings are disguised by affectation and obscured by conceit His declarations of passion are embarrassed by wit and fancy and his style is not intelligible in proportion as it is careless and unadorned His compliments like the modes of behaviour in that age are ceremonious and strained He has too much art as a lover and too little as a poet His gallantries are laboured and his versification negligent The truth is his genius was of the moral and didactic species and his poems abound more in good sense satire and observations on life than in pathos or imagination Yet there  is a degree of lyric sweetness in the following lines to his lute in which  The lover complaineth of the unkindness of his love  My Lute awake performe the last  Labour that thou and I shall wast  And end that I have now begonne  And when this song is sung and past  My lute be still for I have done  As to be heard where care is none  As leade to grave in marble stone  My song now pearse her hart as sone  Should we then sigh or sing or mone  No no my lute for I have done  The rockes do not so cruelly  Repulse the waves continually  As she my sute and affection  So that I am past remedy  Whereby  Wherefore  my lute and I have done  Proude of the spoile which thou has gotte  Of simple hartes through Loves shotte  By whom unkinde thou hast them wonne  Thinke not he hath his bowe forgotte  Although my lute and I have done  Vengeance shall fall on thy disdaine  That makest but game on earnest paine  Thinke not alone under the sunne  Unquit  Unacquitted Free  to cause thy lovers plaine  Although my lute and I have done  May chaunce thee  It may chance you may c  lie withered and olde  In winter nightes that are so colde  Plaining in vaine unto the mone  Moon    Thy wishes then dare not be tolde  Care then who list for I have done  And then may chaunce thee to repent  The time that thou hast lost and spent  To cause thy lovers sighe and swowne  Then shalt thou know beautie but lent  And wish and want as I have done  Now cease my lute this is the last  Labour that thou and I shall wast  And ended is that that we begonne  Now is this song both song and past  My lute be still for I have done  Fol    Our author has more imitations and even translations from the Italian poets than Surrey and he seems to have been more fond of their conceits Petrarch has described the perplexities of a lover's mind and his struggles betwixt hope and despair a subject most fertile of sentimental complaint by a combination of contrarieties a species of wit highly relished by the Italians I am says he neither at peace nor war I burn and I freeze I soar to heaven and yet grovel on the earth I can hold nothing and yet grasp every thing My prison is neither shut nor is it opened I see without eyes and I complain without a voice I laugh and I weep I live and am dead Laura  to what a condition am I reduced by your cruelty  Pace non trovo e non ho da far guerra  E temo e spero ed ardo e son en un ghiaccio  E volo sopra'l cielo e giaccio in terra  E nulla stringo e tutto l'mondo abraiccio  Tal m'ha in prigion che non m'apre nè serra  Thi  passage is taken from Messen Jordi a Provencial poet of Valen  i      Nè per suo mi rittien ne scioglie il laccio  E non m'uccide Amor e non mi sferra  Ni mi vuol vivo ni mi trae d'impaccio  Veggio senz' occhi e non ho lingua e grido  E bramo di perir e cheggio aita  Ed ho in odio me stesso ed amo altrui  Pascomi di dolor piangendo rido  Egualmente mi spiace morte e vita  In questo stato son Donna per vui  Sonn ciii There is a Sonnet in imitation of this among those of the UNCERTAIN AUCTOURS at the end of Surrey'  Poems  fol And in Davison's POEMS B ii CANZON viii p th edit Lond mo    Wyat has thus copied this sonnet of epigrams  I finde no peace and all my warre is done  I fear and hope I burne and frese likewyse  I flye aloft and yet cannot aryse  And nought I have and at the world I season  That lockes  That which locks i e a key  nor loseth nor holdeth me in prison  And holdes me not yet can I scape no wise  Nor lettes me live nor dye at my devi  e  And yet of death it giveth me occasion  Without eye I se without tong I playne  I wish to perish yet I aske for helth  I love another and I hate myselfe  I fede me in sorow and laugh in all my paine  Lo thus displeaseth me both death and life  And my delight is causer of this strife  Fol    It was from the capricious and overstrained invention of the Italian poets that Wyat was taught to  orture the passion of love by prolix and intricate comparisons and unnatural allusions At one time his love is a galley steered by cruelty through stormy seas and dangerous rocks the sails torn by the blast of tempestuous sighs and the cordage consumed by incessant showers of tears a cloud of grief envelopes the stars  reason is drowned  and the haven is at a distance  Fol  At another  Fol  it is a spring trickling from the summit of the Alps which gathering force in its fall at length overflows all the plain beneath  Fol  Sometimes it is a gun which being overcharged expands the flame within itself and bursts in pieces  Fol  Sometimes it is like a prodigious mountain which is perpetually weeping in copious fountains and sending forth sighs from its forests which bears more leaves than fruits which breeds wildbeasts the proper emblems of rage and harbours birds that are always singing  Fol  In another of his sonnets he says that all nature sympathises with his passion The woods resound his elegies the rivers stop their course to hear him complain and the grass weeps in dew These thoughts are common and fantastic But he adds an image which is new and has much nature and sentiment although not well expressed  The hugy okes have rored in the winde  Eche thing methought complaining in theyr kinde  This is a touch of the pensive And the apostrophe which follows is natural and simple  Ah stony hart who hath thus framed thee  So cruel that art clothed with beautie  Fol    And there is much strength in these lines of the lover to his bed  The place of slepe wherein I do but wake  Besprent with tears my bed I thee forsake  Fol    But such passages as these are not the general characteristics of Wyat's poetry They strike us but seldom amidst an impracticable  mass of forced reflections hyperbolical metaphors and complaints that move no compassion  But Wyat appears a much more pleasing writer when he moralises on the felicities of retirement and attacks the vanities and vices of a court with the honest indignation of an independent philosopher and the freedom and pleasantry of Horace Three of his poetical epistles are professedly written in this strain two to John Poines  He seems to have been a person about the court See LIFE of Sir Thomas Pope p  and the other to sir Francis Bryan and we must regret that he has not left more pieces in a style of composition for which he seems to have been eminently qualified In one of the epistles to Poines on the life of a courtier are these spirited and manly reflections  Myne owne John Poines since ye delite to know  The causes why that homewarde I me drawe  And flee the prease  Press Croud  of courtes where so they go  The court was perpetually moving from one palace to another    Rather than to live thrall under the awe  Of lordly looks wrapped within my cloke  To will and lust learning to set a law  It is not that because I scorne or mocke  The power of them whom Fortune here hath lent  Charge over us of Right  Justice  to strike the stroke  But true it is that I have alwayes ment  Lesse to esteeme them than the common sort  Of outwarde thinges that judge in their entent  Without regarde what inward doth resort  I graunt sometime of glory that the fire  Doth touch my heart Me list not to report  To speak favourably of what is bad  Blame by honour nor honour to desire  But how can I this honour now attaine  That cannot die the colour black a liar  My Poines I cannot frame my tune  Perhaps the re  ding is  tongue  to faine  To cloke the truth c  In pursuit of this argument he declares his indisposition and inability to disguise the truth and to flatter by a variety of instances Among others he protests he cannot prefer Chaucer's TALE of SIR THOPAS to his PALAMON AND AR  ITE  Prayse SIR THOPAS for a noble tale  And scorne the STORY that the KNIGHT tolde  Praise him for counsell that is dronke of ale  Grinne when he laughes that beareth all the sway  Frowne when he frownes and grone when he is pale  On others lust to hang both night and day c  I mention this circumstance about Chaucer to shew the esteem in which the KNIGHT'S TALE that noble epic poem of the dark ages was held in the reign of Henry eighth by men of taste  The poet's execration of flatterers and courtiers is contrasted with the following entertaining picture of his own private life and rural enjoyments at Allinghamcastle in Kent  This is the cause that I could never yet  Hang on their sleeve  that weigh as thou maist se  A chippe of chaunce more than a pounde of wit  This maketh me at home to hunt and hawke  And in fowle wether at my booke to sit  In frost and snowe then with my bow to stalke  No man doth marke whereso I ride or go  In lusty leas  In large fields Over fruitful grounds  at liberty I walke  And of these newes I fele no weale nor wo  Save that a clogge doth hange yet at my hele  Probably he alludes to some office which he still held at court and which sometimes recalled him but not too frequently from the country    No force for that for it is ordred so  That I may leape both hedge and dike ful wele  I am not now in Fraunce to judge the wine c  But I am here in Kent and Christendome  Among the Muses where I reade and rime  Where if thou list mine owne John Poines to come  Thou shalt be judge how do I spende my time  Fol    In another epistle to John Poines on the security and happiness of a moderate fortune he versifies the fable of the City and Country Mouse with much humour  My mother's maides when they do sowe and spinne  They sing a song made of the feldishe mouse c  This fable appositely suggests a train of sensible and pointed observations on the weakness of human conduct and the delusive plans of life  Alas my Poines how men do seke the best  And finde the worse by errour as they stray  And no marvell when sight is so opprest  And blindes the guide anone out of the way  Goeth guide and all in seking quiet lyfe  O wretched myndes There is no golde that may  Graunt that you seke no warre no peace no strife  No no although thy head were hoopt with golde  Serjaunt at mace with hawbert  Halbert A parade of guards c The classical allusion is obvious  sworde nor knife  Cannot repulse the care that folow shoulde  Eche kinde of life hath with him his disease  Live in delites even as thy lust would  And thou shalt finde when lust doth most thee please  It irketh strait and by itself doth fade  A small thing is it that may thy minde appease  None of you al there is that is so madde  To seke for grapes on brambles or on breeres  So read instead of  bry  rs    Nor nonne I trowe that hath a wit so badde  To sett his hay for conneyes oer rivères  Nor yet set not a drag net for a hare  And yet the thing that most is your desire  You do misseke with more travell and care  Make plaine thine hart that it be not knotted  With hope or dreade and se thy will be bare  Free  From all affects  Passions  whom vice hath never spotted  Thyself content with that is thee assinde  Assigned    And use it wel that is to the allotted  Then seke no more out of thyself to fynde  The thing that thou hast sought so long before  For thou shalt feele it sticking in thy mynde  These Platonic doctrines are closed with a beautiful application of virtue personified and introduced in her irresistible charms of visible beauty For those who deviate into vain and vicious pursuits  None other paine pray I for them to be  But when the rage doth leade them from the right  That loking backwarde VIRTUE they may se  Even as she is so goodly faire and bright  Fol    With these disinterested strains we may join the following single stanza called THE COURTIERS LIFE  In court to serve decked with freshe aray  Of sugred  Delicious  meates feeling the swete repaste  The life in bankets and sundry kindes of play  Amid the prease of worldly lookes to waste  Hath with it joinde oft times such bitter taste  That whoso joyes such kind of life to hold  In prison joyes fettred with chaines of gold  Fol    Wyat may justly be deemed the first polished English satirist I am of opinion that he mistook his talents when in compliance with the mode he became a sonnetteer and if we may judge from a few instances that he was likely to have treated any other subject with more success than that of love His abilities were seduced and misapplied in fabricating fine speeches to an obdurate mistress In the following little ode or rather epigram on a very different occasion there is great simplicity and propriety together with a strain of poetic allusion It is on his return from Spain into England  Tagus farewel that westward with thy stremes  Turnes up the graines of gold al redy tride  Pure gold    For I with spurre and  ayle go seke the Temes  The Thames    Gainward the sunne that shewes her welthy pride  And to the town that Brutus sought by dremes  A tradition in Geoffrey of Monmouth    Like bended moone  The old city from the river appeared in the shape of a crescent  that leanes her lusty  Strong flourishing populous c  side  My king my countrey I seke for whom I live  O mighty Jove the windes for this me give  Fol    Among Wyat's poems is an unfinished translation in Alexandrine verse of the Song of Iopas in the first book of Virgil's Eneid  Fol  Wyat's and Surrey's versions from Virgil are the first  regular translations in English of an antient classic poet and they are symptoms of the restoration of the study of the Roman writers and of the revival of elegant literature A version of David's Psalms by Wyat is highly extolled by lord Surrey and Leland But Wyat's version of the PENITENTIAL PSALMS seems to be a separate work from his translation of the whole Psaltery and probably that which is praised by Surrey in an ode above quoted and entitled  Praise of certain Psalmes of David translated by Sir T Wyat the elder  Fol See supr p  They were printed with this title in  "Certaine Psalmes chosen out of the Psalmes of David commonly called vij penytentiall Psalmes drawen into Englishe meter by sir Thomas Wyat knyght whereunto is added a prolog of the aucthore before every Psalme very pleasant and profettable to the godly reader Imprinted at London in Paules Churchyarde at the sygne of the starre by Thomas Raynald and John Harryngton cum previlegio ad imprimendum solum MDXLIX"  Leland seems to speak of the larger version  Transtulit in nostram Davidis carmina linguam  Et numeros magna reddidit arte pares  Non morietur OPUS tersum SPECTABILE sacrum  N  N ut supr    But this version with that of Surrey mentioned above is now lost  See Hollinsh CHR  N iii p col  and the pious Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins are the only immortal translators of David's Psalms  A similarity or rather sameness of studies as it is a proof so perhaps it was the chief cement of that inviolable friendship which is said to have subsisted between Wyat and Surrey The principal subject of their poetry was the same and they both treated the passion of love in the spirit of the Italian poets  and as professed disciples of Petrarch They were alike devoted to the melioration of their native tongue and an attainment of the elegancies of composition They were both engaged in translating Virgil and in rendering select portions of Scripture into English metre  SECT XXI  TO the poems of Surrey and Wyat are annexed as I have before hinted in Tottell's editions those of uncertain authors  They begin at fol  This latter collection forms the first printed poetical miscellany in the English language although very early manuscript miscellanies of that kind are not uncommon Many of these pieces are much in the manner of Surrey and Wyat which was the fashion of the times They are all anonymous but probably sir Francis Bryan George Boleyn earl of Rochford and lord Vaulx all professed rhymers and sonnetwriters were large contributors  Drayton in his elegy  To his dearly loved friend  HENRY REYNOLDS OF POETS AND POESIE seems to have blended all the several collections of which Tottell's volume consists After Chaucer he says  They with the Muses who conversed were  That princely Surrey early in the time  Of the eighth Henry who was then the prime  Of England's noble youth With him there came  Wyat with reverence whom we still do name  Amongst our poets Bryan had a share  With the two former which accounted are  That time's best Makers and the authors were  Of those small poems which the title bear  Of Songes and Sonnetts wherein oft they hit  On many dainty passages of wit  WORKS vol iv  p edit Lond vo    Sir Francis Bryan was the friend of Wyat as we have seen and served as a commander under Thomas earl of Surrey in an expedition into Brittany by whom he was knighted for his bravery  Dugd BAR ii a  Hence he probably became connected with lord Surrey the poet But Bryan was one of the brilliant ornaments of the court of king Henry the eighth which at least affected to be polite and from his popular accomplishments as a wit and a poet he was made a gentleman of the privychamber to that monarch who loved to be entertained by his domestics  Rymer FO  D xiv  Yet he enjoyed much more important appointments in that reign and in the first year of Edward the sixth and died chief justiciary of Ireland at Waterford in the year  Hollinsh CHRON i And Ibid Hooker's CONTIN tom ii P ii pag See also FOX MARTYR p  On the principle of an unbiassed attachment to the king he wrote epistles on Henry's divorce never published and translated into English from the French Antonio de Guevara's Spanish Dissertation on the life of a courtier printed at London in the year last mentioned  Cod Impress A Wood Mus Ashmol Oxon  He was nephew to John Bourchier lord Berners the translator of Froissart who at his desire translated at Calais from French into English the GOLDEN BOKE or Life of Marcus Aurelius about  See the COLOPHON It was printed by Thomas Berthelett in quarto Often afterwards Lord Berners was deputygeneral of Calais and its Marches  Which are Bryan's pieces I cannot ascertain  George Boleyn viscount Rochford was son of sir Thomas Boleyn afterwards earl of Wiltshire and Ormond and at Oxford discovered an early propensity to polite letters and poetry He was appointed to several dignities and offices by king Henry the eighth and subscribed the famous declaration sent to Pope Clement the seventh He was brother to queen Anne Boleyn with whom he was suspected of a criminal familiarity The chief accusation against him seems to have been that he was seen to whisper with the queen one morning while she was in  bed As he had been raised by the exaltation he was involved in the misfortunes of that injured princess who had no other fault but an un  uarded and indiscrete frankness of nature and whose character has been blackened by the bigotted historians of the catholic cause merely because she was the mother of queen Elisabeth To gratify the ostensible jealousy of the king who had conceived a violent passion for a new object this amiable nobleman was beheaded on the first of May in  See Dugd BARON iii p a  His elegance of person and spritely conversation captivated all the ladies of Henry's court Wood says that at the  "royal court he was much  adored  especially by the  female sex  for his  admirable  discourse and  symmetry  of body  Ath Oxon i  "  From these irresistible allurements his enemies endeavoured to give a plausibility to their infamous charge of an incestuous connection After his commitment to the Tower his sister the queen on being sent to the same place asked the lieutenant with a degree of eagerness  "Oh where is my sweet brother  Strype MEM i p  "  Here was a specious confirmation of his imagined guilt this stroke of natural tenderness was too readily interpreted into a licentious attachment Bale mentions his RHYTHMI ELEGANTISSIMI  ii  which Wood calls  "Songs and Sonnets with other things of the like nature  Ubi supr  "  These are now lost unless some as I have insinuated are contained in the present collection a garland in which it appears to have been the fashion for every FLOWERY COURTIER to leave some of his blossoms But Boleyn's poems cannot now be distinguished  The lord Vaulx whom I have supposed and on surer proof to be another contributor to this miscellany could not be the Nicholas lord Vaux whose gown of purple velvet plated with gold eclipsed all the company present at the marriage of prince Arthur who shines as a statesman and a soldier with uncommon lustre in the history of Henry the seventh and continued  to adorn the earlier annals of his successor and who died in the year Lord Vaux the poet was probably Thomas lord Vaux the son of Nicholas and who was summoned to parliament in and seems to have lived till the latter end of the reign of queen Mary  See what I have said of his son lord William in the LIFE OF SIR THOMAS POPE p In sir Tho Pope leaves him a legacy of one hundred pounds by the name of lord Vaulx  All our old writers mention the poetical lord Vaux as rather posterior to Wyat and Surrey neither of whom was known as a writer till many years after the death of lord Nicholas George Gascoyne who wrote in in his panegyric on the ENGLISH POETS places Vaux after Surrey  Piers Plowman was full playne  And Chaucer's spreet was greate  Earle Surrey had a goodly vayne  LORD VAUX the marke did beate  Puttenham author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE having spoken of Surrey and Wyat immediately adds  "In the SAME TIME or NOT LONG AFTER was the lord Nicholas  The christian name is a mistake into which it was  asy to fall  Vaux a man of much facilitie in vulgar making  Fol  "  Webbe in his DISCOURSE OF ENGLISH POETRIE published in has a similar arrangement Great numbers of Vaux's poems are extant in the PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES and instead of the rudeness of Skelton they have a smoothness and facility of manner which does not belong to poetry written before the year in which lord Nicholas Vaux died an old man  See Percy's BALL ii edit  The PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES was published in and he is there simply styled  Lord Vaulx the elder  this was to distinguish him from his son lord William then living If lord Nicholas was a writer of poetry I will venture to assert that none of his performances now remain notwithstanding the  testimony of Wood who says that Nicholas  "in his juvenile years was sent to Oxon where by reading humane and romantic rather than philosophical authors he advanced his genius very much in poetry and history  ATH OXON i  "  This may be true of his son Thomas whom I suppose to be the poet But such was the celebrity of lord Nicholas's public and political character that he has been made to monopolise every merit which was the property of his successors All these difficulties however are at once adjusted by a manuscript in the British Museum in which we have a copy of Vaux's poem beginning  I lothe that I did love  with this title  "A dyttye or sonet made by the lord Vaus in the time of the noble quene Marye representing the image of Death  MSS HARL  "  This sonnet or rather ode entitled  The aged lover renounceth love  which was more remembered for its morality than its poetry and which is idly conjectured to have been written on his deathbed  G Gascoyne says  "The L Vaux his dittie beginning thus  I loath  was thought by some to be made upon his d  athbed c"  EPISTL  TO THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN prefixed to his Poems  makes a part of the collection which I am now examining  Fol  From this ditty are taken three of the stanzas yet greatly disguised and corrupted of the Gravedigger's Song in Shakespeare's HAMLET  Act V  Another of lord Vaux's poems in the volume before us is the ASSAULT OF CUPIDE UPON THE FORT IN WHICH THE LOVER'S HEART LAY WOUNDED  Fol  These two are the only pieces in our collection of which there is undoubted evidence although no name is prefixed to either that they were written by lord Vaux From palpable coincidencies of style subject and other circumstances a slender share of critical sagacity is sufficient to point out many others  These three writers were cotemporaries with Surrey and Wyat but the subjects of some of the pieces will go far in ascertaining the date of the collection in general There is one on the death  of sir Thomas Wyat the elder who died as I have remarked in  Fol  Another on the death of lord chancellor Audley who died in  Fol  Another on the death of  master  Devereux a son of lord Ferrers who is said to have been a  Cato for his counsel  Fol  and who is probably Richard Devereux buried in Berkyng church  Stowe SURV LOND p fol ed  the son of Walter lord Ferrers a distinguished statesman and

an eminent musician and without his rival on the lute  Fol One Philips is mentioned among the famous English musicians in Meres's  Wits Tresurie  fol I cannot ascertain who this Phillips a musician was But one Robert Phillips or Phelipp occurs among the gentlemen of the royal chapel under Edward the sixth and queen Mary He was also one of the singingmen of saint George's chapel at Windsor  nd Fox says  "he was so  notable  a singingman wherein he  gloried  that wheresoever he came the longest song with most  counterverses  in it should be set up against him"  Fox adds that while he was singing on one side of the choir of Windsor chapel  O Redemptrix et Salvatrix  he was answered by one Testwood a singer on the other side  Non Redemptrix nec Salvatrix  For this irreverence and a few other slight heresies Testwood was burnt at Windsor ACTS and MONUM vol ii p I must add that sir Thomas Phelyppis or Philips is mentioned as a musician before the reformation Hawki  s HIST MUS ii  Another on the death of a countess of Pembroke who is celebrated for her learning  and her perfect virtues linked in a chaine  Fol  probably Anne who was buried magnificently at saint Pauls in the

with some verses on his picture  Fol  Here is also a poem on a treasonable conspiracy which is compared to the stratagem of Sinon and which threatened immediate extermination to the British constitution but was speedily discovered  Fol  I have not the courage to explore the formidable columns of the circumstantial Hollingshed for this occult piece of history which I leave to the curiosity and conjectures of some more laborious investigator It is certain that none of these pieces are later than the year as they were published in that year by Richard Tottell the printer We may venture to say that almost all of them were written between the years and  There is an epitaph by W G made on himself with an answer  ol I cannot explain those initials At fol a lady called Arundel is highly celebrated for her incomparable beauty and accomplishments perhaps of lord Arundel's family  Thus A  UND  L sits throned still with Fam  c  Most of them perhaps within the first part of that period  The following nameless stanzas have that elegance which results from simplicity The compliments are such as would not disgrace the gallantry or the poetry of a polished age The thoughts support themselves without the aid of expression and the affectations of language This is a negligence but it is a negligence produced by art Here is an effect obtained which it would be vain to seek from the studied ornaments of style  Give place ye ladies and be gone  Boast not yourselves at all  For here at hand approcheth one  Whose face will staine you all  The vertue of her lively lokes  Excels the precious stone  I wish to have none other bokes  To reade or loke upon  In eche of her two cris  all eyes  Smileth a naked boye  It would you all in hart suffice  To se that lampe of joye  I thinke Nature hath lost the moulde  See this thought in Surrey supr  itat p  Where she her shape did take  Or els I doubt if Nature coulde  So faire a creature make  In life she is Diana chaste  In truth Penelopey  In worde and eke in dede stedfast  What would you more we sey  If all the worlde were sought so farre  Who could finde such a wight  Her beuty twinkleth like a starre  Within the frosty night  Her rosial colour comes and goes  With such a comly grace  More ruddy too than is the rose  Within her lively face  At Bacchus feaste none shall her mete  Ne at no wanton play  Nor gasing in an open strete  Nor gadding as astray  The modest mirth that she doth use  Is mixt with shamefa  tnesse  Al vice she doth wholy refuse  And hateth ydlenesse  O lord it is a world to see  How vertue can repaire  And decke in her such honestie  Whom nature made so faire  Howe might I do to get a graffe  Of this unspotted tree  For all the rest are plaine but chaffe  Which seme good corn to be  Fol    Of the same sort is the following stanza on Beauty  Then BEAUTY stept before the barre  Whose breast and neck was bare  With haire trust up and on her head  A caule of golde she ware  Fol    We are to recollect that these compliments were penned at a time when the graces of conversation between the sexes were unknown and the dialogue of courtship was indelicate when the monarch of England in a style which the meanest gentleman would now be ashamed to use pleaded the warmth of his affection by drawing a coarse allusion from a present of venison which he calls flesh in a loveletter to his future queen Anne Boleyn a lady of distinguished breeding beauty and modesty  See Hearne's AVESBURY APPEND p    In lord Vaux's ASSAULT OF CUPIDE abovementioned these are the most remarkable stanzas  When Cupide scaled first the fort  Wherin my hart lay wounded sore  The batry was of such a sort  That I must yelde or die therfore  There sawe I Love upon the wall  How he his baner did display  Alarme Alarme he gan to call  And bade his souldiours kepe away  The armes the which that Cupid bare  Were pearced hartes with teares besprent  And even with the trumpettes sowne  The scaling ladders were up set  And BEAUTY walked up and downe  With bow in hand and arrowes whet  Then first DESIRE began to scale  And shrouded him under his targe c  Fol    Puttenham speaks more highly of the contrivance of the allegory of this piece than I can allow  "In this figure counterfait action the lord Nicholas  For Thomas  Vaux a noble gentleman and much delighted in vulgar making  English poetry  and a man otherwi  e of no great learning but having herein a marvelous facilitie made a dittie representing the Battayle and Assault of Cupid so excellently well as for the gallant and propre aplication of his fiction in every part I cannot choose but set downe the greatest part of his ditty for in truth it cannot be amended  When Cupid scaled  c  Pag  "  And in another part of the  ame book  "The lord Vaux his commendation lyeth chiefly in the facilitie of his meetre and the aptnesse of his descriptions suche as he taketh upon him to make namely in sundry of his songes wherein he sheweth the COUNTERFAIT ACTION very lively and pleasantly  Pag  "  By  counterfait action  the critic means fictitious action the action of imaginary beings expressive of fact and reality There is more poetry in some of the old pageants described by Hollingshed than in this allegory of Cupid Vaux seems to have had his eye on Sir David Lyndsey's GOLDEN TERGE  See supr Vol ii p    In the following little ode much pretty description and imagination is built on the circumstance of a lady being named Bayes So much good poetry could hardly be expected from a pun  In Bayes I boast whose braunch I beare  Such joye therein I finde  That to the death I shall it weare  To ease my carefull minde  In heat in cold both night and day  Her vertue may be sene  When other frutes and flowers decay  The Bay yet growes full greene  Her berries feede the birdes ful oft  Her leaves swete water make  Her bowes be set in every loft  For their swete savour's sake  The birdes do shrowd them from the cold  In her we dayly see  And men make arbers as they wold  Under the pleasant tree  Fol    From the same collection the following is perhaps the first example in our language now remaining of the pure and unmixed pastoral and in the erotic species for ease of numbers elegance of rural allusion and simplicity of imagery excels every thing of the kind in Spenser who is erroneously ranked as our earliest English bucolic I therefore hope to be pardoned for the length of the quotation  Phyllida was a faire mayde  As fresh as any flour  Whom Harpalus the herdman prayde  To be her paramour  Harpalus and eke Corin  Were herdmen both yfere  Together    And Phyllida could twist and spin  And thereto sing full clere  But Phyllida was all to coy  For Harpalus to winne  For Corin was her only joy  Who forst her not a pinne  Loved her not in the least    How often would she flowers twine  How often garlandes make  Of couslips and of columbine  And al for Corin's sake  But Corin he had hawkes to lure  And forced more the fielde  More engaged in fieldsports    Of lovers lawe he toke no cure  For once he was begilde  Deceived Had once been in love    Harpalus prevailed nought  His labour all was lost  For he was fardest from her thought  And yet he loved her most  Therefore waxt he both pale and leane  And drye as clot  Clod  of clay  His fleshe it was consumed cleane  His

Overwatched That is her eyes w  r  always awake never closed by sleep    His face besprent with teares  It semde Vnhap had him long hatched  In mids of his dispaires  His clothes were blacke and also bare  As one forlorne was he  Upon his head alwayes he ware  A wreath of wyllow tree  His beastes he kept upon the hyll  And he sate in the dale  And thus with sighes and sorowes shryll  He gan to tell his tale  "O Harpalus thus would he say  "Unhappiest under sunne  "The cause of thine unhappy day  "By love was first begunne  "For thou wentst first by sute to seke  "A tigre to make tame  "That

loves her so  "But welaway that nature wrought  "Thee Phyllida so faire  "For I may say that I have bought  "Thy beauty all too deare c  ol  "  The illustrations in the two following stanzas of the restlessness of a lover's mind deserve to be cited for their simple beauty and native force of expression  The owle with feble sight  Lyes lurking in the leaves  The sparrow in the frosty night  May shroud her in the eaves  But wo to me alace  In sunne nor yet in shade  I cannot finde a resting place  My burden to unlade  Fol    Nor can I omit to notice the sentimental and expressive metaphor contained in a single line  Walking the path of pensive thought  Fol    Perhaps there is more pathos and feeling in the Ode in which  The Lover in despaire lamenteth his Case  than in any other piece of the whole collection  Adieu desert how art thou spent  Ah dropping tears how do ye waste  Ah scalding sighes how ye be spent  To pricke Them forth that will not haste  Ah pained hart thou gapst for grace  Favour    Even there where pitie hath no place  As easy tis the stony rocke  From place to place for to remove  As by thy plaint for to provoke  A frosen hart from hate to love  What should I say Such is thy lot  To fawne on them that force  Love  thee not  Thus mayst thou safely say and sweare  That rigour raignes where ruth  Pity  doth faile  In thanklesse thoughts thy thoughts do weare  Thy truth thy faith may nought availe  For thy good will why shouldst thou so  Still graft where grace it will not grow  Alas poore hart thus hast thou spent  Thy flowring time thy pleasant yeres  With sighing voice wepe and lament  For of thy hope no frute apperes  Thy true meaning is paide with scorne  That ever soweth and repeth no corne  And where thou sekes a quiet port  Thou dost but weigh against the winde  For where thou gladdest woldst resort  There is no place for thee assinde  Assigned    Thy destiny hath set it so  That thy true hart should cause thy wo  Fol    These reflections resulting from a retrospect of the vigorous and active part of life destined for nobler pursuits and unworthily wasted in the tedious and fruitless anxieties of unsuccessful love are highly natural and are painted from the heart but their force is weakened by the poet's allusions  T  is miscellany affords the first pointed English epigram that I remember and which deserves to be admitted into the modern collections of that popular species of poetry Sir Thomas More  was one of the best jokers of that age and there is some probability that this might have fallen from his pen It

defied  Fol  The unfortunate queen only quoted a distich applicable to her situation which she remembered in a fashionable sett of poems perhaps the amusement of her youth  The ode which is the comparison of the author's  faithful and painful  passion with that of Troilus  Fol  is founded on Chaucer's  poem or Boccace's on the same subject This was the most favorite lovestory of our old poetry and from its popularity was wrought into a drama by Shakespeare Troilus's sufferings for Cressida were a common topic for a lover's fidelity and assiduity Shakespeare in his MERCHANT OF VENICE compares a night favorable to the stratagems or the meditation of a lover to such a night as Troilus might have chosen for stealing a view of the Grecian camp from the ramparts of Troy  And sigh'd his soul towards the Grecian tents  Where Cressid lay that night  Act V Sc i    Among these poems is a short fragment of a translation into Alexandrines of Ovid's epistle from Penelope to Ulysses  Fol  This is the first attempt at a metrical translation of any part of Ovid into English for Caxton's Ovid is a loose paraphrase in prose Nor were the heroic epistles of Ovid translated into verse till the year by George Tuberville It is a proof that the classics were studied when they began to be translated  It would be tedious and intricate to trace the particular imitations of the Italian poets with which these anonymous poems abound Two of the sonnets  Fol  are panegyrics on Petrarch and Laura names at that time familiar to every polite reader and the patterns of poetry and beauty The sonnet on  The diverse and contrarie passions of the lover  Fol  is formed on one of Petrarch's sonnets and which as I have remarked before was translated by sir Thomas Wyat  Supr p  So many of the nobility and principal persons about the court writing sonnets in the Italian style is a circumstance which must have greatly contributed to circulate this mode of composition and to encourage the study of the Italian poets Beside lord Surrey sir Thomas Wyat lord Boleyn lord Vaux and sir Francis Bryan already mentioned Ed  und  lord Sheffield created a baron by king Edward the sixth and killed by a butcher in the Norfolk insurrection is said by Bale to have written sonnets in the Italian manner  See Tanner BIBL p Dugd BAR iii    I have been informed that Henry lord Berners translated some of Petrarch's sonnets  MSS Oldys  But this nobleman otherwise deserved notice here for his prose works which cooperated with the romantic genius and the gallantry of the age He translated and by the king's command Froissart's chronicle which was printed by Pinson in Some of his other translations are professed romances He translated from the Spanish by desire of the lady of sir Nicholas Carew THE CASTLE OF LOVE From the French he translated at the request of the earl of Huntingdon SIR HUGH OF BOURDEAUX which became exceedingly popular And from the same language THE HISTORY OF ARTHUR an

SONGES and SONNETTES of UNCERTAIN AUCTOURS in Tottell's edition are annexed SONGES WRITTEN BY N G  They begin with fol  By the initials N G we are to understand Nicholas Grimoald a name which never appeared yet in the poetical biography of England But I have before mentioned him incidentally  See vol ii  He was a native of Huntingdonshire and received the first part of his academical institution at Christ's college in Cambridge Removing to Oxford in the year he was elected fellow of Merton College but about having opened a rhetorical lecture in the refectory of Christchurch then newly founded he was transplanted to that society which gave the greatest encouragement to such students as were distinguished for their proficiency in criticism and philology The same year he wrote a Latin tragedy which probably was acted in the college entitled ARCHIPROPHETA  ive  JOHANNES BAPTISTA TRAGAEDIA That is  The Archprophet  or  Saint John Baptist  a tragedy and dedicated to the dean Richard Cox  Printed Colon vo See supr vol ii  In the year  ii Edw vi  he explained all the four books of Virgil's Georgics in a regular prose Latin paraphrase in the public hall of his college  Printed at London in vo  He wrote also explanatory commentaries or lectures on the Andria of Terence the Epistles of Horace and many pieces of Cicero perhaps for the same auditory He translated Tully's Offices into English This translation which is dedicated to the learned Thirlby bishop of Ely was printed at London    In octavo Again  He also familiarised some of the purest Greek classics by English versions which I believe were never printed Among others was the CYROPAEDIA Bale the biographer and bishop of Ossory says that he turned Chaucer's TROILUS into a play but whether this piece was in Latin or English we are still to seek and the word  Comedia  which Bale uses on this occasion is without precision or distinction The same may be said of what Bale calls his FAME  a comedy  Bale also recites his System of Rhetoric for the use of Englishmen  Rhetorica in usum Britannorum  which seems to be the course of the rhetorical lectures I have mentioned It is to be wished that Bale who appears to have been his friend  Bale cites his comment or paraphrase on th  first Eclogue of Virgil addressed  ad Amicum Joannem Bal  um  viii  and therefore possessed the opportunities of information had given

is the same person called by Strype  one Grimbold  who was chaplain to bishop Ridley and who was employed by that prelate while in prison to translate into English Laurentio Valla's book against the fiction of Constantine's DONATION with some other popular Latin pieces against the papists  See Strype's CRANMER B iii c p And GRINDAL Fox edit i And Wood ATH OXON i  In the ecclesiastical history of Mary's reign he appears to have been imprisoned for heresy and to have saved his life if not his credit by a recantation But theology does not seem to have been his talent nor the glories of martyrdom to have made any part of his ambition One of his plans but which never took effect was to print a new edition of Josephus Iscanus's poem on the TROJAN WAR with emendations from the most correct manuscripts  Bale ubi supr    I have taken more pains to introduce this Nicholas Grimoald to the reader's acquaintance because he is the second English poet after lord Surrey who wrote in blankverse Nor is it his  only praise that he was the first who followed in this new path of versification To the style of blankverse exhibited by Surrey he added new strength elegance and modulation In the disposition and conduct of his cadencies he often approaches to the legitimate structure of the improved blankverse but we cannot suppose that he is entirely free from those dissonancies and asp  rities which still adhered to the general character and state of our diction  In his poem on the DEATH OF MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO are these lines The assassins of Cicero are said to relent  When  They his bare neck behelde and his hore heares  Scant could they hold the teares that forth gan burst  And almost fell from bloody handes the swoordes  Onely the sterne Herennius with grym looke  Dastardes why stande ye still he saith and straight  Swapt off the head with his presumptuous yrone  Ne with the slaughter yet is he not filled  Fowle shame on shame to hepe is his delite  Wherefore the handes also he doth offsmyte  Which durst Antonius' life so lively paint  Him yelding strained ghoste  His constrained spirit  from welkin hie  With lothly chere lord Phebus gan beholde  And in black clowde they say long hid his hed  The Latine Muses and the Grayes  Grai    Greek  they wept  And for his fall eternally shall wepe  And lo hartpersing PITHO  P  itho th  goddess of persuasion  strange to tell  Who had suffisde to him both sence and wordes  When so he spake and drest with nectar soote  That flowyng toung when his windpipe disclosde  Fled with her fleeing friend  Fol  and out alas  Hath left the earth ne will no more returne  Nor is this passage unsupported by a warmth of imagination and the spirit of pathetic poetry The general cast of the whole poem shews that our author was not ill qualified for dramatic composition  Another of Grimoald's blankverse poems is on the death of Zoroas an Egyptian astronomer who was killed in Alexander's first battle with the Persians It is opened with this nervous and animated exordium  Now clattering armes now ragyng broyls of warre  Gan passe the noyes of dredfull trompets clang  The reader must recollect Shakespeare'    Loud larums neighing steeds and TRUMPETS CLANG    Shrowded with shafts the heaven with clowd of darts  Covered the ayre Against fullfatted bulls  As forceth kindled yre the lyons keene  Whose greedy gutts the gnawing honger pricks  So Macedonians 'gainst the Persians fare  Fol    In the midst of the tumult and hurry of the battle appears the sage philosopher Zoroas a classical and elegant description of whose skill in natural science forms a pleasing contrast amidst images of death and destruction and is inserted with great propriety as it is necessary to introduce the history of his catastrophe  Shakyng her bloody hands Bellone among  The Perses sowth all kynde of cruel deth  Him smites the club him wounds farstrikyng bow  And him the slyng and him the shining swoord  Right over stood in snowwhite armour brave  Brav    is richly decked    The Memphite Zoroas a cunning clarke  To whom the heaven lay open as his boke  And in celestiall bodies he could tell  The moving meting light

In the prime tide  Spring  Printemps  doth season well the soyl  Why sommer burnes why autumne hath ripe grapes  Whether the circle quadrate may become  Whether our tunes heavens harmony can yeld  Whether any music made by man  n resemble that of the Spheres    What star doth let  Hinder  the hurtfull sire  Saturn  to rage  Or him more milde what opposition makes  What fire doth qualify Mavorses  Of Mavors or the planet M  rs  fire c  Fol    Our astronomer finding by the stars that he is destined to die speedily chuses to be killed by the hand of Alexander whom he endeavours to

thus the soveraign sayd  Alighted Zoroas c  Fol    I have a suspicion that these two pieces in blankverse if not fragments of larger works were finished in their present state as prolusions or illustrative practical specimens for our author's course of lectures in rhetoric In that case they were written so early as the year There is positive proof that they appeared not later than when they were first printed by Tottell  I have already mentioned lord Surrey's Virgil and for the sake of juxtaposition will here produce a third specimen of early blankverse little known In the year William Vallans published a blankverse poem entitled A TALE OF TWO SWANNES which under a poetic fiction describes the situation and antiquities of several towns in Hertfordshire The author a native or inhabitant of Hertfordshire seems to have been connected  with Camden and other ingenious antiquaries of his age I cite the exordium  When Nature nurse of every living thing  Had clad her charge in brave and new array  The hils rejoist to see themselves so fine  The fields and woods grew proud thereof also  The meadowes with their partiecolour'd coates  Like to the rainebow in the azurd skie  Gave just occasion to the cheerfull birdes  With sweetest note to singe their nurse's praise  Among the which the merrie nightingale  With swete and swete her breast against a thorne  Ringes out all night c  London Printed by Roger Ward for Robert Sheldrake MDXC to Sheets He mentions most of the Seats in Hertfordshire then existing belonging to the queen and the nobility See Hearne's LEL ITIN V Pr p iv seq ed    Vallans is probably the author of a piece much better known a history by many held to be a romance but which proves the writer a diligent searcher into antient records entitled  "The HONOURABLE PRENTICE Shewed in the Life and Death of Sir JOHN HAWKEWOOD sometime Prentice of London interlaced with the famous History of the noble FITZWALTER Lord of Woodham in Essex  The founder of

v ii p xvi  "  The reader will observe that what has been here said about early specimens of blankverse is to be restrained to poems not  written for the stage Long before Vallans's TWO SWANNES many theatrical pieces in blankverse had appeared the first of which is The TRAGEDY OF GORDOBUCKE written in The second is George Gascoigne's JOCASTA a tragedy acted at Graysinn in George Peele had also published his tragedy in blankverse of DAVID and BETHSABE about the year  Shakespeare did not begin writing for the stage till Jonson about  HIERONYMO a tragedy also without rhyme was acted before But this point which is here only transiently mentioned will be more fully considered hereafter in its proper place We will now return to our author Grimoald  Grimoald as a writer of verses in rhyme yields to none of his cotemporaries for a masterly choice of chaste expression and the concise elegancies of didactic versification Some of the couplets in his poem IN PRAISE OF MODERATION have all the smartness which marks the modern style of sententious poetry and would have done honour to Pope's ethic epistles  The auncient Time commended not for nought  The Mean What better thing can there

illustration nor is the collision of opposite thoughts which the subject so naturally affords extravagantly pursued or indulged beyond the bounds of good sense and propriety The following stanzas on

valuable miscellany without acknowledging our obligations to its original editor Richard Tottell who deserves highly of English literature for having collected at a critical period and preserved in a printed volume so many admirable specimens of antient genius which would have mouldered in manuscript or perhaps from their detached and fugitive state of existence their want of length the capriciousness of taste the general depredations of time inattention and other accidents would never have reached the present age It seems to have given birth to two favorite and celebrated collections of the same kind THE PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES and ENGLAND'S HELICON which appeared in the reign of queen Elisabeth  •    u  The reader will observe that I have followed the paging and arrangement of Tottell's second edition in mo In his edition of there is much confusion A poem is there given to Grimoald on the death of lady Margaret Lee in Also among Grimoald's is a poem on Sir James Wilford mentioned above who appears to have  ought under Henry the eighth in the the wars ef France and Scotland This edition of is not in quarto as I have called it by an oversight but in small duodecimo and only with signatures It is not mentioned by Ames and I have seen it only among Tanner's printed books at Oxford It has this colophon  "Imprinted at London in Flete strete within Temple barre at the sygne of the hand and starre by Richard Tottel the sifte day of June An  Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum  "    SECT XXIII  IT will not be supposed that all the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth were educated in the school of Petrarch The graces of the Italian muse which had been taught by Surrey and Wyat were confined to a few Nor were the beauties of the classics yet become general objects of imitation There are many writers of this period who still rhymed on in the old prosaic track of their immediate predecessors and never ventured to deviate into the modern improvements The strain of romantic fiction was lost in the place of which they did not substitute the elegancies newly introduced  I shall consider together yet without an exact observation of chronological order the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth who form this subordinate class and who do not bear any mark of the character of the poetry which distinguishes this period Yet some of these have their degree of merit and if they had not necessarily claimed a place in our series deserve examination  Andrew Borde who writes himself ANDREAS PERFORATUS with about as much propriety and as little pedantry as Buchanan calls one Wisehart SOPHOCARDIUS was educated at Winchester and Oxford  See his INTRODUCTION TO KNOWLEDGE ut infr cap xxxv  and is said I believe on very slender proof to have been physician to king Henry the eighth His BREVIARY OF HEALTH first printed in  "Compyled by Andrewe Boorde of Physicke Doctoure an Englysshe man"  It was reprinted by William Powell in and again in There was an impression by T East  to Others also in and which I have never seen The latest is by East in to  is dedicated to the  college of physicians into which he had been incorporated The first book of this treatise is said to have been examined and approved by the University of Oxford in  At the end of which is this Note  "Here  ndeth the first bok  Examined in Oxforde in the yere of our Lord  MCCCCCXLVI c"  He chiefly practiced in Hampshire and being popishly affected was censured by Poynet a Calvinistic bishop of Winchester for keeping three prostitutes in his house which he proved to be his patients  See  Against Mart  n  c p  He appears to have been a man of great superstition and of a weak and whimsical head and having been once a Carthusian continued ever afterwards to profess celibacy to drink water and to wear a shirt of hair His thirst of knowledge dislike of the reformation or rather his unsettled disposition led him abroad into various parts of Europe which he visited in the medical character Wood says that he was  "esteemed a noted poet a witty and ingenious person and an excellent physician"  Hearne who has plainly discovered the origin of Tom Thumb is of opinion that this facetious practitioner in physic gave rise to the name of MERRY ANDREW the Fool on the mountebank's stage The reader will not perhaps be displeased to see that antiquary's reasons for this conjecture which are at the same time a vindication of Borde's character afford some new anecdotes of his life and shew that a Merry Andrew may be a scholar and an ingenious man  "It is observable that the author Borde was as fond of the word DOLENTYD as of many other hard and uncooth words as  any Quack can be  He begins his BREVIARY OF HEALTH  Egregious doctours and Maysters of the eximious and archane science of Physicke of your urbanite exasperate not your selve  c But notwithstanding this will any one from hence infer or assert that the author was either a  pedant  or a  superficial  scholar I think  upon due consideration  he will judge the contrary Dr Borde was an  ingenious  man and knew how to humour and please his patients readers and auditors In  his travells and visits he often appeared and spoke in public and would often frequent markets and fairs where a conflux of people used to get together to whom he prescribed and to induce them to flock thither the more readily he would make  humorous  speeches couched in such language as  caused mirth  and  wonderfully  propagated his fame and 'twas for the same end that he made use of such expressions in his Books as would otherwise the  circumstances  not considered be very justly pronounced  bombast  As he was  versed in antiquity  he had words at command from old writers with which to amuse his hearers which could not fail of  pleasing  provided he added at the same time some  remarkable explication  For instance if he told them that  was an old brass medal among the Greeks the  oddness  of the word would  without doubt  gain  attention  tho nothing  near so much  as if  withall  he  signified  that 'twas a brass medal a  little bigger  than an Obolus that used to be put in the mouths of persons that were deadAnd withall 'twould  affect them the more  if when he spoke of such a brass medal he signified to them that brass was in old time looked upon as  more honourable than other metals  which he might  safely enough do  from  Homer  and his  scholiast  Homer's words are c A passage which  without doubt  HIERONYMUS MAGIUS would have taken notice of in the fourteenth chapter of his Book DE TINTINNABULIS had it occurred to his memory when in prison he was writing without the help of books before him that  curious Discourse  'Twas from the Doctor's method of using such speeches at markets and fairs that in  aftertimes  those that imitated the like  humorous jocose  language were styled MERRY ANDREWS a term  much in vogue  on our stages  Hearne's BENEDICT ABB Tom i P  AE  AT p edit Oxon

obsolete and that Blount might have enriched his book on ANTIENT TENURES with these ludicrous stories He is speaking of the political design of REYNARD THE FOX printed by Caxto    "It was an  admirable Thing  And the design being political and to represent a wise government was equally good So little reason is there to look upon this as a  poor despicable  book Nor is there more reason to esteem THE MERRY TALES OF THE MAD MEN OF GOTHAM which was much  valued  and  cried up  in Henry the eighth's time tho now sold at balladsingers stalls as  altogether a romance  a certain  skillfull  person having told me more than once that he was  assured by one of Gotham  that they formerly held lands there by such Sports and Customs as are touched upon in this book For which reason I think particular notice should have been taken of it in Blount's TENURES as I do not doubt but there would had that  otherwise curious  author been apprised of the  matter  But 'tis  strange  to see the

is entitled  "The first Boke of the INTRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE the which doth teach a man to speake parte of al maner of languages and to knowe the usage and fashion of al maner of countryes and for to knowe the most parte of al maner of coynes of money the  whych is currant in every region Made by Andrew Borde of phisyk doctor"  It was printed by the Coplands and is dedicated to the king's daughter the princess Mary The dedication is dated from Montpelier in the year The book containing thirtynine chapters is partly in verse and partly in prose with wooden cuts prefixed to each chapter The first is a satire as it appears on the fickle nature of an Englishman the symbolical print prefixed to this chapter exhibiting a naked man with a pair of sheers in one hand and a roll of cloth in the other not determined what sort of a coat he shall order to be made has more humour than any of the verses which follow  Harrison in his DESCRIPTION OF ENGLAND having mentioned this work by Borde add    "Suche is our mutabili  ie that to daie there is none equal to the  Spanish  guise to morrow the  Fr  nch  toies are most fine and d  lectable yer ere long no such apparel as that which is after the

poetry destitute of humour only but of every embellishment both of metrical arrangement and of expression Borde has all the baldness of allusion and barbarity of versification belonging to Skelton without his strokes of satire and severity The following lines part of the Englishman's speech will not prejudice the reader in his favour  What do I care if all the world me faile  I will have a

laurelcrown on his head with a book before him on a desk  and owns that his metre deserves no higher appellation than  ryme d  grell  But this delineation of the fickle Englishman is perhaps to be restricted to the circumstances of the author's  age without a respect to the national character and as Borde was a rigid catholic there is a probability notwithstanding in other places he treats o  natural dispositions that a satire is designed on the laxity of principle and revolutions of opinion which prevailed at the reformation and the easy compliance of many of his changeable countrymen

astronomical tracts have been epitomised and bound up with Erra Pater's Almanacs  Of Borde's numerous books the only one that can afford any degree of entertainment to the modern reader is the DIETARIE OF HELTHE where giving directions as a physician concerning the choice of houses diet and apparel and not suspecting how little he should instruct and how much he might amuse a curious

annexed to the Kitchen Many of the chambers to have a view into the Chapel In the outer quadrangle to be a stable but only for  horses of pleasure  The stables dairy and slaughterhouse to be a quarter

dated  This work is dedicated to Thomas duke of Norfolk lord treasurer under Henry the eighth In the dedication he speaks of his  being called in as a physician to sir John Drury the year when cardinal Wolsey was promoted to York but that he did not chuse to prescribe without consulting doctor Buttes the king's physician He apologises to the duke for not writing in the  ornate  phraseology now generally affected He also hopes to be excused for using in his writings so many  wordes of mirth  but this he says was only to make  your grace merrie  and because mirth has ever been esteemed the best medicine Borde must have had no small share of vanity who could think thus highly of his own pleasantry And to what a degree of taste and refinement must our antient dukes and lords treasurers have arrived who could be exhilarated by the witticisms and the lively language of this facetious philosopher  John Bale a tolerable Latin classic and an eminent biographer before his conversion from popery and his advancement to the bishoprick of Ossory by king Edward the sixth composed many scriptural interludes chiefly from incidents of the New Testament They are the Life of Saint John the Bap  ist written in Christ in his twelfth year Baptism and Temptation The Resurrection of Lazarus The Council of the Highpriests Simon the Leper Our Lord's Supper and the Washing of the feet of his Disciples Christ's Burial and Resurrection The Passion of Christ The  Comedie  of the three Laws of Nature Moses and Christ corrupted by the Sodomites Pharisees and Papists printed by Nicholas Bamburgh in and so popular that it was reprinted by Colwell in  Both in quarto At the end is  A Song of Benedictus  compiled by Johan Bale  God's Promises to Man  This was written in And first printed under the name of a TRAGEDIE or ENTE  LUDE by Ch  lewood to  Our author in his  Vocacyon to the Bishoprick of Ossory  informs us that his COMEDY of John the Baptist and his TRAGEDY of God's Promises were acted by the youths upon a Sunday at the market cross of Kilkenny  Fol  What shall we think of the state I will not say of the stage but of common sense when these deplorable dramas could be  endured Of an age when the Bible was profaned and ridiculed from a principle of piety But the fashion of acting mysteries appears to have expired with this writer He is said by himself to have written a book of Hymns and another of jests and tales and to have translated the tragedy of PAMMACHIUS  CENT viii p And Verheiden p  the same perhaps which was acted at Christ's college in Cambridge in and afterwards laid before the privy council as a libel on the reformation  See vol ii p Bale says  "Pammachii tragoedias transtuli"  A low vein of abusive burlesque which had more virulence than humour seems to have been one of Bale's talents two of his pamphlets against the papists all whom he considered as monks are entitled the MASS OF THE GLUTTONS and the ALCORAN OF THE PRELATES  Ibid  Next to exposing the impostures of popery literary history was his favorite pursuit and his most celebrated performance is his account of the British writers But this work perhaps originally undertaken by Bale as a vehicle of his sentiments in religion is not only full of misrepresentations and partialities arising from his religious prejudices but of general inaccuracies proceeding from negligence or misinformation Even those more antient Lives which he transcribes from Leland's commentary on the same subject are often interpolated with false facts and impertinently marked with a misapplied zeal for reformation He is angry with many authors who flourished before the thirteenth century for being catholics He tells us that lord Cromwell frequently screened him from the fury of the more bigotted bishops on account of the comedies he had published  "Ob editas COMAEDIAS"  Ubi supr  But whether plays in particular or other compositions are here to be understood by comedies is uncertain  Brian Anslay or Annesley yeoman of the wine cellar to Henry the eighth about the year translated a popular French poem into English rhymes at the exhortation of the  gentle earl

Edward on the  Active policy of a prince  finished in the author's eightieth year The prologue begins with a compliment to  "Maisters Gower Chaucer and Lydgate"  a proof of the estimation which that

entitled FABYL'S GHOSTE printed by John Rastell in the year The piece is of no merit and I should not perhaps have mentioned it but as the subject serves to throw light on our early drama Peter Fabell whose apparition speaks in this poem was called The  Merrie Devil of Edmonton  near London He lived in the reign of Henry the seventh and was buried in the church of Edmonton Weever in his ANTIENT

his talents of jocularity in conversation he joined a skill in music both vocal and instrumental His merriments were so irresistible that they moved even the rigid muscles of queen Mary and her sullen

year are destitute of plot humour or character and give us no very high opinion of the festivity of this agreeable companion They consist of low incident and the language of ribaldry But perfection must not be expected before its time He is called our first writer of comedies But those who say this speak without determinate ideas and confound comedies with moralities and interludes We will allow

number of all the  PROVERBES  in the English tongue compact in a matter concerning two marriages  The first edition I have seen is dated  In quarto Others followed to  All the proverbs of the English

as a repertory of proverbs made at so early a period Nor was the plan totally void of ingenuity to exhibit these maxims in the course of a narrative enlivened by facts and circumstances It certainly was susceptible of humour and invention  Heywood's largest and most laboured performance is the SPIDER AND THE FLIE with wooden cuts printed at London by Thomas Powell in  In quarto  It is a very long poem in the octave stanza containing ninetyeight chapters Perhaps there never was so dull so tedious and trifling an apologue without fancy meaning or moral A long tale of fictitious manners will always be tiresome unless the design be burlesque and then the ridiculous arising from the contrast between the solemn and the light must be ingeniously supported Our author seems to have intended a fable on the burlesque construction but we know not when he would be serious and when witty whether he means to make the reader laugh or to give him advice We must indeed acknowledge that the age was not yet sufficiently  refined either to relish or to produ  e burlesque poetry  But I must not forget Chaucer's SIR THOPAS and that among the Cotton manuscripts there is a  anonymous poem perhaps coeval with Chaucer in the style of allegorical burlesque which describes the power of money with great humour and in no common vein of satire The hero of the piece is SIR PENNY MSS Cott CAL A  IN

been formed from this printed in ANTIENT SCOTTISH POEMS p Edinb See supr vol i  Harrison the author of the DESCRIPTION OF BRITAINE prefixed  to Hollinshed's Chronicle has left a sensible criticism on this poem  "One hath made a boke of the SPIDER AND  FLIE wherin he dealeth so profoundly and beyond all measure of skill that neither he himself that made it neither any one that readeth it can reach unto the meaning thereof  DESCRIPT BRIT p Hollinsh CHRON tom i  "  It is a proof of the unpopularity of this poem that it never was reprinted Our author's EPIGRAMS and the poem of PROVERBS were in high vogue and had numerous editions within the year The most lively part of the SPIDER and FLIE is perhaps the mockfight between the spiders and flies an awkward imitation of Homer's BATRACHOMUOMACHY The preparations for this bloody and eventful engagement on the part of the spiders in their cobwebcastle are thus described  Behold the battilments in every loope  How th' ordinance lieth flies far and nere to fac    Behold how everie peace that lieth there in groope  In rows    Hath a spider gonner with redyf  red match  Behold on the wals spiders making ware wach  The wachspider in the towre a larum to strike  At aproch of any nomber shewing warlike  Se th' enprenabill  Impregnable  fort in every border  How everie spider with his wepon doth stand  So thorowlie harnest  Clad in armour  in so good order  The capital  Perhaps Capitayne  spider with wepon in hand  For that sort of sowdiers so manfully mand  With copwebs like casting nets all flies to quell  My hart shaketh at the sight behold it is hell  Cap Signat B b    The beginning of all this confusion is owing to a fly entering the poet's window not through a broken pane as might be presumed but through the lattice where it is suddenly entangled in a cobweb  Cap i  The cobweb however will be allowed to be sufficiently  descriptive of the poet's apartment But I mention this circumstance as a probable proof that windows of lattice and not of glass were now the common fashion  See his EPIGRAMMES Epig FIRST HUNDRED And Puttenham's ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE Lib i c p One of Heywood's Epigrams is descriptive of his life and character FIFTE HUNDRED Epigr  OF HEYWOOD  Art thou Heywood with the mad mery wit  Yea forsooth mayster that same is even hit  Art thou Heywood that applieth mirth more than thrift  Ye sir I take mery mirth a golden gift  Art thou Heywood that hath made many mad Playes  Yea many playes few good woorkes in all my dayes  Art thou Heywood that hath made men mery long  Yea and will if I be made mery longe  Art thou Heywood that would be made mery nowe  Yea sir help me to it now I beseech yow  In the CONCLUSION to the SPIDER and FLIE Heywood mentions queen Mary and king Philip But as most of his pieces seem to have been written some time before I have placed him under Henry the eighth    John Heywood died at Mechlin in Brabant about the year He was inflexibly attached to the catholic cause and on the death of queen Mary quitted the kingdom Antony Wood remarks  ATH OXON i  with his usual acrimony that it was a matter of wonder with many that considering the great and usual want of principle in the profession a poet should become a voluntary exile for the sake of religion  SECT XXV  I KNOW not if sir Thomas More may properly be considered as an English poet He has however left a few obsolete poems which although without any striking merit yet as productions of the restorer of literature in England seem to claim some notice here One of these is A MERY JEST  how a  SERGEANT  would learne to play the  FREERE  Written by Maister Thomas More in hys youth  WORKERS Lond in folio Sign C i  The story is too dull and too long to be told here But I will cite two or three of the prefatory stanzas  He that hath lafte  Left  the Hosier's crafte  And fallth to makyng shone  Shoes    The smyth that shall to paynting fall  His thrift is well nigh done  A black draper with whyte paper  To goe to writing scole  An old butler becum a cutler  I wene shal prove a fole  And an old trot that can god wot  Nothyng but kysse the cup  With her phisicke will kepe one sicke  Till she hath soused hym up  A man of law that never sawe  The wayes to bye and sell  Wenyng to ryse by marchandyse  I praye god spede hym well  A marchaunt eke that wyll goo seke  By all the meanes he may  To fall in s  te tyll he dispute  His money cleane away  Pletyng the lawe for every strawe  Shall prove a thrifty man  With bate  Debate  and strife but by my life  I cannot tell you whan  Whan an h  tter will smatter  In philosophy  Or a pedlar waxe a medlar  In theology  In these lines which are intended to illustrate by familiar examples the absurdity of a serjeant at law assuming the business of a friar perhaps the reader perceives but little of that festivity which is supposed to have marked the character and the conversation of sir Thomas More The last two stanzas deserve to be transcribed as they prove that this tale was designed to be sung to music by a minstrel for the entertainment of company  Now Maisters all here now I shall  End then as I began  In any wyse I would avyse  And counsayle every man  His own cra  te use all new refuse  And lyghtly let them gone  Play not the FREERE Now make good cheere  This piece is mentioned among other popular storybooks in by Laneham in his ENTERTAINMENT AT KILLINGWORTH CASTLE in the reign of queen Elisabeth  Fol seq    In CERTAIN METERS written also in his youth as a prologue for his BOKE OF FORTUNE and forming a poem of considerable  length are these stanzas which are an attempt at personification and imagery FORTUNE is represented sitting on a lofty throne smiling on all mankind who are gathered around her eagerly expecting a distribution of her favours  Then as a bayte she bryngeth forth her ware  Silver and gold rich perle and precious stone  On whiche the mased people gase and stare  And gape therefore as dogges doe for the bone  FORTUNE at them laugheth and in her trone  Amyd her treasure and waveryng rychesse  Prowdly she hoveth as lady and empresse  Fast by her syde doth wery Labour stand  Pale Fere

Sign C iiii    Another of sir Thomas More's juvenile poems is A RUFULL LAMENTATION on the death of queen Elisabeth wife of Henry the seventh and mother of Henry the eighth who died in childbed in It is evidently formed on the tragical soliloquies which compose Lydgate's paraphrase of Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM and which gave birth to the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES the origin of our historic dramas These stanzas are part of the queen's complaint at the approach of death  Where are our castels now where are our towers  Goodly Rychemonde  The palace of Richmond  sone art thou gone from me  At Westmynster that costly worke of yours  Myne owne dere lorde now shall I never se  King Henry the seventh's chapel begun in the year The year before the queen died    Almighty God

WORKES ut supr    In the fourth stanza she reproaches the astrologers for their falsity in having predicted that this should be the happiest and most fortunate year of her whole life This while it is a natural reflection in the speaker is a proof of More's contempt of a futile and frivolous science then so much in esteem I have been prolix in my citation from this forgotten poem but I am of opinion that some of the stanzas have strokes of nature and pathos and deserved to be rescued from total oblivion  More when a young man contrived in an apartment of his father's house a  goodly hangyng of fyne painted clothe  exhibiting nine pageants or allegoric representations of the stages of man's life together with the figures of Death Fame Time and Eternity Under each picture he wrote a stanza The first is under CHILDHOODE expressed by a boy whipping a top  I am called CHILDHOD in play is all my mynde  To cast a coyte  A quoit  a cokstele  A stick for throwing at a cock STELE is handl    Sax  or a ball  A toppe can I set and dryve in its kynde  But would to God these hatefull bookes all  Were in a fyre ybrent to pouder small  Then myght I lede my lyfe alwayes in play  Which lyfe God sende me to myne endyng day  Next was pictured MANHOD a comely young man mounted on a fleet horse with a hawk on his fist and followed by two greyhounds with this stanza affixed  MANHOD I am therefore I me delyght  To hunt and hawke to nourishe up and fede  The grayhounde to the course the hawke to th' flyght  And to bestryde a good and lusty stede  These thynges become a very man in dede  Yet thinketh this boy his pevishe game sweter  But what no force his reason is no better  The personification of FAME like RUMOUR in the Chorus to Shakespeare's HENRY THE FIFTH is surrounded with tongues  Ibid Sign C iii    Tapestry with metrical legends illustrating the subject was common in this age and the public pageants in the streets were often exhibited with explanatory verses I am of opinion that the COMOEDIOLAE or little interludes which More is said to have written and acted in his father's house were only these nine pageants  See supr Vol ii p    Another juvenile exercise of More in the English stanza is annexed to his prose translation of the LYFE of John Picus Mirandula and entitled TWELVE RULES OF JOHN PICUS MIRANDULA  partely exciting partely directing a man in  SPIRITUAL BATAILE  These pieces were written in the reign of Henry the seventh But as Mor  flourished in the succeeding reign I have placed them accordingly  The old collector of his ENGLISH WORKES has also preserved two  shorte ballettes  Ibid b iii  or stanzas which he wrote for his  pastyme  while a prisoner in the tower  Ut supr fol    It is not my design by these specimens to add to the  ame of sir Thomas More who is reverenced by posterity as the scholar who taught that erudition which civilised his country and as the philosopher who met the horrours of the block with that fortitude which was equally free from ostentation and enthusiasm as the man whose genius overthrew the fabric of false learning and whose amiable tranquillity of temper triumphed over the malice and injustice of tyranny  To some part of the reign of Henry the eighth I assign the TOURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM or  The wooeing winning and wedding of  TIBBE  the Reeves Daug  ter there  I presume it will not be supposed to be later than that reign and the substance of its phraseology which I divest of its obvious innovations is not altogether obsolete enough for a highe  period I am aware that in a manuscript of the British Museum it is referred to the time of Henry the sixth But that manuscript  affords no positive indication of that date  MSS HARL  It was published from an antient manuscript in the year and reduced to a more modern style by William Bedwell rector of Tottenham and one of the translators of the Bible He says it was written by Gilbert Pilkington supposed to have been rector of the same parish and author of an unknown tract called PASSIO DOMINI JESU But Bedwell without the least comprehension of the scope and spirit of the piece imagines it to be a serious narrative of a real event and with as little sagacity believes it to have been written before the year Allowing that it might originate from a real event and that there might be some private and local abuse at the bottom it is impossible that the poet could be serious Undoubtedly the chief merit of this poem although not destitute of humour consists in the design rather than the execution As Chaucer in the RIME OF SIR THOPAS  I take this opportunity of observing that the stanza of one of Laurence Minot's poems on the wars of Edward the third is the same as Chaucer's SIR TOPAS Minot was Chaucer's cotempary

romances of chivalry the TOURNAMENT  OF TOTTENHAM is a burlesque on the parade and  opperies of chivalry itself In this light it may be considered as a curiosity and does honour to the good sense and discernment of the writer who seeing through the  olly of these fashionable exercises was sensible at the same time that they were too popular to be attacked by the more solid weapons of reason and argument Even on a supposition that here is an allusion to real facts and characters and that it was intended to expose some popular story of the amours of the daughter of the Reve of Tottenham we must acknowledge that the satire is conveyed in an ingenious mode He has introduced a parcel of clowns and rustics the inhabitants of Tottenham Islington Highgate and Hackney places then not quite so polished as at present who imitate all  the solemnities of the barriers The whole is a mockparody on the challenge the various events of the encounter the exhibition of the prize the devices and escocheons the display of arms the triumphant procession of the conqueror the oath before the combat and the splendid feast which followed with every other ceremony and circumstance which constituted the regular tournament The reader will form an idea of the work from a short extract  V    He that bear'th him best in the tournament  Shal be graunted the gree  Prize  by the common assent  For to

that it was a disgrace to chivalry to ride a mare  The poems of this manus  ript do not seem to be all precisely of the same hand and might probably once have been separate papers here stitched together At the end of one of them viz fol  The lysom ledys the Blynde  mention is inserted of an accompt settled ann H  n vi And this is in the hand and ink of that poem and of some others The TOURNAMENT OF TOTT  N  AM which might once have been detached from the present collection comes at some distance afterwards and cannot perhaps for a certainty be pronounced to be of the same writing I take this opportunity of correcting a wrong reference to SIR P  NI just cited at p It belongs to GAL  E  MSS Cott    It appears to me that the author to give dignity to his narrative and to heighten the ridicule by stiffening the familiarity of his incidents and characters has affected an antiquity of style This I could prove from the cast of its fundamental diction and idiom with which many of the old words do not agree Perhaps another of the author's affectations is the alliterative manner For although other specimens of alliteration in smaller pieces are now to be found yet it was a singularity To those which I have mentioned of this reign I take this opportunity of adding an alliterative poem which may be called the FALCON AND THE PIE who support a DYALOGUE DESENSYVE FOR WOMEN AGAYNST MALICYOUS DETRACTOURS printed in  Coloph  "Thus endeth the faucon and pie anno dni Imprynted by me Rob Wyer for Richarde Bankes"  I have an antient manuscript alliterative poem in which a despairing lover bids farewel to his mistress At the end is written  "Explicit Amōr p Ducem Ebōrr nuper fact"  I will here cite a few of the stanzas of this unknown prince  Farewell Ladè of grete

illustrating the age of pieces which have been lately or will be soon produced I here stop to  recall the reader's attention to the poetry and language of the last century by exhibiting some extracts from the manuscript romance of YWAIN and GAWAIN which has some great outlines of Gothic painting and appears to have been written in the reign of king Henry the sixth  MSS Cotton GALB E ix  I premise

placing the NOTBROWNE MAYDE under some part of this reign Prior who about the year paraphrased this poem without improving its native beauties supposes it to have been three hundred years old It appears from two letters preserved in the British Museum written by Prior to Wanley lord Oxford's librarian that Prior consulted Wanley about this antient ballad  MSS HARL  It is however certain that Wanley an antiquarian of unquestionable skill and judgement in these niceties whatever directions and information he might have imparted to Prior on this subject could never have communicated such a decision He certainly in these letters gives no such opinion  These letters are printed in the ADDITIONS TO POPE'S WORKS in two volumes published about two years ago  This is therefore the hasty conjecture of Prior who thought that the curiosity which he was presenting to the world would derive proportionable value from its antiquity who was better employed than in the petty labour of ascertaining dates and who knew much more of modern than antient poetry  The NOTBROWNE MAYDE first appeared in Arnolde's CHRONICLE or CUSTOMS OF LONDON which was first printed about the year This is perhaps the most heterogeneous and multifarious miscellany that ever existed The collector sets out with a catalogue of the mayors and sheriffs the customs and charters of the city of London Soon afterwards we have  receipts to pickle sturgeon to make vinegar ink and gunpowder how to raise parsley in an hour the arts of brewery and soapmaking an estimate of the livings in London an account of the last visitation of saint Magnus's church the weight of Essex cheese and a letter to cardinal Wolsey The NOTBROWNE MAYDE is introduced between an estimate of some subsidies paid into the exchequer and directions for buying goods in Flanders In a word it seems to have been this compiler's plan by way of making up a volume to print together all the notices and papers whether antient or modern which he could amass of every sort and subject It is supposed that he intended an antiquarian repertory but as many recent materials were admitted that idea was not at least uniformly observed nor can any argument be drawn from that supposition that this poem existed long before and was inserted as a piece of antiquity  The editor of the PROLUSIONS infers  PROLUSIONS or  select pieces of antient Poetry  Lond to Pref p vii  from an identity of rhythmus and orthography and an affinity of words and phrases that this poem appeared after sir Thomas More's JEST OF THE SERJEANT AND FREER which as I have observed was written about the year This reasoning were not other arguments obvious would be inconclusive and might be turned to the opposite side of the question But it is evident from the language of the NOTBROWNE MAYDE that it was not written earlier than the beginning at least of the sixteenth century There is hardly an obsolete word or that requires a glossary in the whole piece and many parts of Surry and Wyat are much more difficult to be understood Reduce any two stanzas to modern orthography and they shall hardly wear the appearance of antient poetry The reader shall try the experiment on the two following which occur accidentally  V    HE  Yet take good hede for ever I drede  That ye could nat sustayne  The thornie wayes the depe valèis  The snowe the frost the rayne

alone  The simplicity of which passage Prior has thus decorated and dilated  HENRY  Those limbs in lawn and softest silk array'd  From sunbeams guarded and of winds afraid  Can they bear angry Jove can they resist  The parching dogstar and the bleak northeast  When chill'd by adverse snows and beating rain  We tread with weary steps the longsome plain  When with hard toil we seek our evening food  Berries and acorns from the neighbouring wood  And find among the cliffs no other house  But the thin covert of some gather'd boughs  Wilt thou not then reluctant send thine eye  Around the dreary waste and weeping try  Though then alas that trial be too late  To find thy father's hospitable gate  And seats where ease and plenty brooding sate  Those seats whence long excluded thou must mourn  That gate for ever barr'd to thy return  Wilt thou not then bewail illfated love  And hate a banish'd man condemn'd in woods to rove  EMMA  Thy rise of fortune did I only wed  From it's decline determin'd to recede  Did I but purpose to embark with thee  On the smooth surface of a summer's sea  While gentle Zephyrs play in prosperous gales  And Fortune's favour fills the swelling sails  But would forsake the ship and make the shore  When the winds whistle and the tempests roar  No Henry no one sacred oath has tied  Our loves one destiny our life shall guide  Nor wild nor deep our common way divide  When from the cave thou risest with the day  To beat the woods and rouse the bounding prey  The cave with moss and branches I'll adorn  And cheerful sit to wait my lord's return  And when thou frequent bring'st the smitten deer  For seldom archers say thy arrows err  I'll fetch quick fuel from the neighbouriug wood  And strike the sparklng flint and dress the food  With humble duty and officious haste  I'll cull the farthest mead for thy repast  The choicest herbs I to thy board will bring  And draw thy water from the freshest spring  And when at night with weary toil opprest  Soft slumbers thou enjoy'st and wholesome rest  Watchful I'll guard thee and with midnight prayer  Weary the Gods to keep thee in their care  And joyous ask at morn's returning ray  If thou hast health and I may bless the day  My thoughts shall fix my latest wish depend  On thee guide guardian kinsman father friend  By all these sacred names be Henry known  To Emma's heart and grateful let him own  That she of all mankind could love but him alone  What degree of credit this poem maintained among our earlier ancestors I cannot determine I suspect the sentiment was too refined for the general taste Yet it is enumerated among the popular tales and ballads by Laneham in his narrative of queen Elisabeth's entertainment at Kenilworthcastle in  ol  I have never seen it in manuscript I believe it was never reprinted from Arnolde's Chronicle where it first appeared in till so late as the year It was that year revived in a collection called the MONTHLY MISCELLANY or MEMO  RS FOR THE CURIOUS and prefaced with a little essay on our antient poets and poetry in which it is said to have been three hundred old Fortunately for modern poetry this republication suggested it to the notice of Prior who perhaps from the same source might  have adopted or confirmed his hypothesis that it was coeval with the commencement of the fifteenth century  Whoever was the original inventor of this little dramatic dialogue he has shewn no common skill in contriving a plan which powerfully detains our attention and interests the passions by a constant succession of suspence and pleasure of anxiety and satisfaction Betwixt hopes perpetually disappointed and solicitude perpetually relieved we know not how to determine the event of a debate in which new difficulties still continue to be raised and are almost as soon removed In the midst of this vicissitude of feelings a striking contrast of character is artfully formed and uniformly supported between the seeming unkindness and ingratitude of the man and the unconquerable attachment and fidelity of the woman whose amiable compliance unexpectedly defeats every objection and continually furnishes new matter for our love and compassion At length our fears subside in the triumph of suffering innocence and patient sincerity The Man whose hard speeches had given us so much pain suddenly surprises us with a change of sentiment and becomes equally an object of our admiration and esteem In the disentanglement of this distressful tale we are happy to find that all his cruelty was tenderness and his inconstancy the most invariable truth his levity an ingenious artifice and his perversity the friendly disguise of the firmest affection He is no longer an unfortunate exile the profligate companion of the thieves and ruffians of the forest but an opulent earl of Westmoreland and promises that the lady who is a baron's daughter and whose constancy he had proved by such a series of embarrassing proposals shall instantly be made the partner of his riches and honours Nor should we forget to commend the invention of the poet in imagining the modes of trying the lady's patience and in feigning so many new situations which at the same time open a way to description and to a variety of new scenes and images  I cannot help observing here by the way that Prior has misconceived  and essentially marred his poet's design by softening the sternness of the Man which could not be intended to admit of any degree of relaxation Henry's hypocrisy is not characteristically nor consistently sustained He frequently talks in too respectful and complaisant a style Sometimes he calls Emma my  tender maid  and my  beauteous Emma  he fondly dwells on the ambrosial plenty of her flowing ringlets gracefully wreathed with variegated ribbands and expatiates with rapture on the charms of her snowy bosom her slender waist and harmony of shape In the antient poem the concealed lover never abates his affectation of rigour and reserve nor ever drops an expression which may tend to betray any traces of tenderness He retains his severity to the last in order to give force to the conclusion of the piece and to heighten the effect of the final declaration of his love Thus by diminishing the opposition of interests and by giving too great a degree of uniformity to both characters the distress is in some measure destroyed by Prior For this reason Henry during the course of the dialogue is less an object of our aversion and Emma of our pity But these are the unavoidable consequences of Prior's plan who presupposes a long connection between the lovers which is attended with the warmest professions of a reciprocal passion Yet this very plan suggested another reason why Prior should have more closely copied the cast of his original After so many mutual promises and protestations to have made Henry more obdurate would have enhanced the sufferings and the sincerity of the amiable Emma  It is highly probable that the metrical romances of RICHARD CUER DE LYON GUY EARL OF WARWICK and SYR BEVYS OF SOUTHAMPTON were modernised in this reign from more antient and simple narrations The first was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in  In quarto See supr Vol i  p seq  The second without date but about the same time by William Copland I mean that which begins thus  Ithen the tyme that God was borne  And cryst  ndome was set and sworne

Richard Pinson prin  ed SIR BEVYS without date Many quarto prose romances were printed between the years and  See supr p  Of these KYNGE APPOLYN OF THYRE is not one of the worst  In the year as it seems Robert Wyer printed  "Here begynneth a lytell boke named the SCOLE HOWSE wherein every man may rede a goodly Prayer of the condycyons of women"  Within the leaf is a border of naked women This is a satire against the female sex The writer was wise enough to suppress his name as we may judge from the following passage  Trewly some men there be  That lyve alwaye in greate horroure  And say it goth by destenye  To hange or wed both hath one houre  And whether it be I am well sure  Hangynge is better of the twayne  Sooner done and shorter payne  In the year Wynkyn de Worde printed a sett of Christmas Carols  For many small miscellaneous pieces under the reign of Henry viii the more inquisitive reader is referred to MSS Cott VESP A  I have seen a fragment of this scarce book and it preserves this colophon  "Thus endeth the Christmasse carolles newly imprinted at London in the Fletestrete at the sygne of the sonne by Wynkyn de Worde The yere of our Lorde M D XXI  In quarto  "  These were festal chansons for enlivening  the merriments of the Christmas celebrity and not such religious songs as are current at this day with the common people under the same title and which were substituted by those enemies of innocent and useful mirth the puritans The boar's head soused was antiently the first dish on Christmas day and was carried up to the principal table in the Hall with great state and solemnity Hollinshead says that in the year upon the day of the young prince's coronation king Henry the first  "served his sonne at the table as sewer bringing up the BORES HEAD with trumpets before it according to the manner  CHRON iii See also Polyd Virg HIST p  ed  "  For this indispensable ceremony as also for others of that season there was a Carol which Wynkyn de Worde has given us in the miscellany just mentioned as it was sung in his time with the title  "A CAROL bryngyng in the bores head"  Caput Apri defero  Reddens laudes Domino  The bores head in hande bringe I  With garlandes gay and rosemary  I pray you all synge merely  Qui estis in convivio  The bores head I understande  Is the chefe servyce  That is the chief dish served at a feast  in this lande  Loke

Virgine Maria  Be glad lordynges be the more or lesse  I brynge you tydynges of gladnesse  MSS HARL fol fol    The Latin scraps were banished from these jocund hymns when the Reformation had established an English liturgy At length appeared  "Certaine of David's Psalmes intended for Christmas Carolls fitted to the most sollempne tunes every where familiarlie used by William Slatyer printed by Robert Yong  In octavo  "  It was impossible that the Reformation of religion could escape without its rhyming libels Accordingly among others we have  "An Answer to a papystical exhortation pretending to avoyd false doctrine under that colour to mayntayne the same"  printed in and beginning  Every pilde  P  lled i e bald  pedlar  Will be a medlar  In the year a proclamation was promulged prohibiting evildisposed persons to preach either in public or private  "After their  own braine  and by playing of enterludes and printing of false fond bookes ballades rhymes and other lewd treatyses in the English tongue concerning doctrines in matters now in question and controversie c  FOX MARTYROLOG f edit  "  But this popular mode of attack which all understood and in which the idle and unlearned could join appears to have been more powerful than royal interdictions and parliamentary censures  In the year Thomas lord Cromwell during the short  interval which Henry's hasty passion for Catharine Howard permitted between his commitment and execution was insulted in a ballad written by a defender of the declining cause of popery who certainly shewed more zeal than courage in reproaching a disgraced minister and a dying man This satire however unseemly gave rise to a religious controversy in verse which is preserved in the archives of the antiquarian society  I find a poem of thirty octave stanzas printed in called the DOWFAL OF ANTICHRISTES MAS or Mass in which the nameless satirist is unjustly severe on the distresses of that ingenious class of mechanics who got their living by writing and ornamenting servicebooks for the old papistic worship now growing into decay and disuse insinuating at the same time in a strain of triumph the great blow their  craft  had received by the diminution of the number of churches in the dissolution of the monasteries  In a roll of John Morys warden of Winchester college an xx Ric ii A D are large articles of disbursement for grails legends and other servicebooks for the choir of the chapel then just founded It appears that they bought the parchment and hired persons to do the business of writing illuminating noting and

and lucrative occupation was otherwise much injured by the invention and propagation of typography as several catholic rituals were printed in England yet still they continued to employ  writers and illuminators for this purpose The finest and the latest specimen of this sort I have seen is Cardinal Wolsey's LECTIONARY now preserved at Christchurch in Oxford a prodigious folio on vellum written and embellished with great splendor and beauty by the most elegant artists either for the use of his own private chapel or for the magnificent chapel which he had projected for his college and peculiarly characteristic of that prelate's predominant ideas of ecclesiastic pomp  Wynkyn de Worde printed a TRETISE OF MERLYN or his prophesies in verse in Another appeared by John Hawkyns in

longer than the fifth century Hearne also supposes that the pen had succeeded to the style long before the age of Alfred Lel ITIN Vol vii PREF p xxi I will produce an instance of this practice in England so late as the year In an accomptroll of Winchester college of that year is the following disbursement  "Et in i tabula ceranda cum viridi c  ra pro intitulatione capellanorum et clericorum

respective courses of daily or weekly portions of duty alternately assigned to the officers of the choir So far indeed from having ceased in the fifth century it appears that this mode of writing

its length I have only to add that without supposing an allusion to this way of writing it will be hard to explain the following lines in Shakespeare's TIMON OF ATHENS Act i Sc i  My free drift  Halts not particularly but moves itself  "In a wide sea of wax"  Why Shakespeare should here allude to this peculiar and obsolete fashion of writing to express a poet's design of describing general life will appear if we consider the freedom and facility with which it is executed It is not yet I think discovered on what original Shakespeare formed this drama    The public pageantries of this reign are proofs of the growing familiarity and national diffusion of classical learning I  will select an instance among others from the shews exhibited with great magnificence at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn in the year The procession to Westminster abbey began from the Tower and the queen in passing through Gracechurch street was entertained with a representation of mount Parnassus The fountain of Helicon by a bold fiction unknown to the bards of antiquity ran in four streams of Rhenish wine from a bason of white marble On the summit of the mountain sate Apollo and at his feet Calliope On either side of the declivity were arranged four of the Muses playing on their respective  musical instruments Under them were written epigrams and poesies in golden letters in which every Muse praised the queen according to her character and office At the Conduit in Cornhill appeared the three Graces before whom with no great propriety was the spring of  Grace  perpetually running wine But when a conduit came in the way a religious allusion was too tempting and obvious to be omitted Before the spring however  ate a poet describing in metre the properties or functions of every Grace and then each of these four Graces allotted  in a short speech to the queen the virtue or accomplishment over which she severally presided At the Conduit in Cheapside as my chronicler says she was saluted with  "a rich pageaunt full of melodie and song"  In this pageant were Pallas Juno and Venus before them stood Mercury who presented to her majesty in the name of the three goddesses a golden ball or globe divided into three parts signifying wisdom riches and felicity At entering saint Paul's  gate  an antient portal leading into the churchyard on the east and long since destroyed three ladies richly attired showered on her head wafers in which were contained Latin distichs At the eastern side of saint Paul's Churchyard two hundred scholars of saint Paul's School addressed her in chosen and apposite passages from the Roman poets translated into English rhymes On the leads of saint Martin's church stood a choir of boys and men who sung not spiritual hymns but  new balads  in praise of her majesty On the conduit without Ludgate where the arms and angels had been  refreshed  was erected a tower with four turrets within each of which was placed a Cardinal Virtue symbolically habited Each of these personages in turn uttered an oration promising to protect and accompany the queen on all occasions  Hall's CHRONICLE fol ccxii Among the Orations spoken to the Queen is one too curious to be omitted At Leadenhall sate saint Anne with her numerous progeny and Mary Cleophas with her four children One of the children made  "a goodlie oration to the queene of the  fruitfulnes  of saint Anne and of her generation trusting the  like fruit should come of hir  "  Here we see the pagan history and mythology predominating in those spectacles which were once furnished from the Golden Legend Instead of saints prophets apostles and confessors we have Apollo Mercury and the Muses Instead of religious canticles and texts of scripture which were usually introduced in the course of these ceremonies we are entertained with profane poetry translations from the classics and occasional verses with exhortations not delivered by personified doctors of the church but by the heathen divinities  It may not be foreign to our purpose to give the reader some distinct idea of the polite amusements of this reign among which the Masque already mentioned in general terms seems to have held the first place It chiefly consisted of music dancing gaming a banquet and a display of grotesque personages and fantastic dresses The performers as I have hinted were often the king and the chief of the nobility of both sexes who under proper disguises executed some preconcerted strategem which ended in mirth and good humour With one of these shews in the king formed a scheme to surprise cardinal Wolsey while he was celebrating a splendid banquet at his palace of Whitehall  It th  n belonged to Wolsey  At night his majesty in a masque with twelve more masquers all richly but strangely dressed privately landed from Westminster at Whitehall stairs At landing several small pieces of canon were fired which the king had before ordered to be placed on the shore near the house The cardinal who was separately seated at the banquet in the presencechamber under the cloth of state a great number of ladies and lords being seated at the sidetables was alarmed at this sudden and unusual noise and immediately ordered lord Sandys the king's chamberlain who was one of the guests and in the secret to enquire the reason Lord Sandys brought answer that thirteen foreign noblemen of distinction were just arrived and were then waiting in the great hall below having been drawn thither by the report of the cardinal's magnificent banquet and of the beautiful ladies which were present at it The cardinal ordered them immediately into the banquettingroom to which they were conducted from the hall with twenty new torches and a concert of drums and fifes After a proper refreshment they requested in the French language to dance with the ladies whom they kissed and to play with them at mumchance  A game of hazard with dic    producing at the same time a great golden cup filled with many hundred crowns Having played for sometime with the ladies they de  ignedly  lost all that remained in the cup to the cardinal whose sagacity was not easily to be deceived and who now began from some circumstances to suspect one of them to be the king On finding their plot in danger they answered  "If your grace can point him out he will readily discover himself"  The cardinal pointed to a masque with a black beard but he was mistaken for it was sir Edward Nevil At this the king could not forbear laughing aloud and pulling off his own and sir Edward Nevil's masque convinced the cardinal with much arch complaisance that he had for once guessed wrong The king and the masquers then retired into another apartment to change their apparel and in the meantime the banquet was removed and the table covered afresh with perfumed clothes Soon afterwards the king with his company returned and took his seat under the cardinal's canopy of state Immediately two hundred dishes of the most costly cookery and confectionary were served up the contrivance and success of the royal joke afforded much pleasant conversation and the night was spent in dancing diceplaying  banketting and other triumphs  Hollinsh CHRON iii seq  The old chronicler Edward Hall a cotemporary and a curious observer acquaints us that at Greenwich in  "on the daie of the Epiphanie at night the king with eleven others was disguised after the maner of Italie called a Maske a thing not seene before in England they were apparalled in garments long and broad wrought all with gold with visors and caps of gold And after the banket doone these maskers came in with six gentlemen disguised in silke bearing staffetorches and desired the ladies to danse some were content and some refused and after they had dansed and communed togither as the fashion of the maske is they tooke their leave and departed and so did the queene and all the ladies  CHRON fol xv See supr Vol i p  "  I do not find that it was a part of their diversion in these entertainments to display humour and character Their chief aim  seems to have been to surprise by the ridiculous and exaggerated oddity of the visors and by the singularity and splendor of the dresses Every thing was out of nature and propriety Frequently the Masque was attended with an exhibition of some gorgeous machinery resembling the wonders of a modern pantomime For instance in the great hall of the palace the usual place of performance a vast mountain covered with tall trees arose suddenly from whose opening caverns issued hermits pilgrims shepherds knights damsels and gypsies who being regaled with spices and wine danced a morisco or morrisdance They were then again received into the mountain which with a symphony of rebecs and recorders closed its caverns and tumbling to pieces was replaced by a ship in full sail or a castle besieged To be more particular The following device was shewn in the hall of the palace at Greenwich A castle was reared with numerous towers gates and battlements and furnished with every military preparation for sustaining a long siege On the front was inscribed  Le fortresse dangereux  From the windows looked out six ladies cloathed in the richest russet sattin  "laid all over with leaves of gold and every one knit with laces of blew silk and gold on their heads coi  s and caps all of golde"  This castle was moved about the hall and when the queen had viewed it for a time the king entered the hall with five knights in embroidered vestments spangled and plated with gold of the most curious and costly workmanship They assaulted the castle and the six ladies finding them to be champions of redoubted prowess after a parley yielded their perilous fortress descended and danced with their assailants The ladies then led the knights into the castle which immediately vanished and the company retired  Hollinsh iii  Here we see the representation of an action But all these magnificent mummeries which were their eveningamusements on festivals notwithstanding a parley which my historian calls a  communication  is here mentioned were yet in dumb shew  But at a most sumptuous Disguising in in the hall at Greenwich the figure of FAME is introduced who  "in French declared the meaning of the trees the rocke and turneie"  But as this shew was a political compliment and many foreigners present an explanation was necessary See Hall CHRON fol lxvi This was in But in the year a more rational eveningamusement took place in the Hall of the old Westminsterpalace several foreign embassadors being present  "After supper his grace the king with the queene lords and ladies came into the White Hall which was hanged richlie the hall was scaffolded and railed on all parts There was an ENTERLUDE of the gentlemen of his chapell before his grace and diverse freshe songes"  Hall CHRON fol xi xii See supr ii  and without dialogue  But towards the latter part of Henry's reign much of the old cumbersome state began to be laid aside This I collect from a set of new regulations given to the royal houshold about the year by cardinal Wolsey In the Chapter  For keeping the Hall and ordering of the Chapel  it is recited that by the frequent intermission and disuse of the solemnities of dining and supping in the great hall of the palace the proper officers had almost forgot their duty and the manner of conducting that very long and intricate ceremonial It is therefore ordered that when his majesty is not at Westminster and with regard to his palaces in the country the formalities of the Hall which ought not entirely to fall into desuetude shall be at least observed when he is at Windsor Beaulieu or Newhall  A new house built by Henry the eighth Hollinsh  CHRON iii  in Essex Richmond Hamptoncourt Greenwich Eltham and Woodstock And that at these places only the whole choir of the chapel shall attend This attempt to revive that which had began to cease from the nature of things and from the growth of new manners perhaps had but little or no lasting effect And with respect to the Chapel my record adds that when the king is on journies or progresses only six singing boys and six gentlemen of the choir shall make a part of the royal retinue who  "daylie in absence of  the  esidue  of the chapel shall have a Masse of our Ladie bi  ore noon and on Sondaies and holidaies masse of the day besides our Ladymasse and an anthempne in the afternoone  for which purpose no  great carriage  of either vestiments or bookes shall require  "ORDENAUNCES made for the kinges household and chambres"  Bibl Bodl MSS LAUD K fol It is the original on vellum In it Sir Thomas More is mentioned as Chancellour of the Duchie of Lancaster  "  Henry never seems to have been so truly happy as when he was engaged in one of these progresses in other words moving from one seat to another and enjoying his ease and amusements in a state of royal relaxation This we may collect from a curious passage in Hollinshead who had pleased and perhaps informed us less had he never deserted the dignity of the historian  "From thence the whole court remooved to Windsor then beginning his progresse and exercising himselfe dailie in shooting singing dansing wrestling casting of the barre plaieing at the recorders flute virginals in setting of songes and making of balladesAnd when he came to Oking  Woking in Surrey near Guildford a royal seat  there were kept both justes turneies  Chron iii  "  I make no apology for these seeming digressions The manners and the poetry of a country are so nearly connected that they mutually throw light on each other  The same connection subsists between the state of poetry and of the arts to which we may now recall the reader's attention with as little violation of our general subject  We are taught in the mythology of the antients that the three Graces were produced at a birth The meaning of the fable is that the three most beautiful imitative arts were born and grew up together Our poetry now beginning to be divested of its monastic barbarism and to advance towards elegance was accompanied by proportionable improvements in Painting and Music Henry employed many capital painters and endeavoured to invite Raphael and Titian into England Instead of allegorical tapestry many of the royal apartments were adorned with historical pictures Our familiarity with the manners of Italy and affectation of Italian accomplishments influenced the tones and enriched  the modulation of our musical composition Those who could read the sonnets of Petrarch must have relished the airs of Palestrina At the same time Architecture like Milton's lion  pawing to get free  made frequent efforts to disentangle itself from the massy incumbrances of the Gothic manner and began to catch the correct graces and to copy the true magnificence of the Grecian and Roman models Henry was himself a great builder and his numerous edifices although constructed altogether on the antient system are sometimes interspersed with chaste ornaments and graceful mouldings and often marked with a legitimacy of proportion and a purity of design before unattempted It was among the literary plans of Leland one of the most classical scholars of this age to write an account of Henry's palaces in imitation of Procopius who is said to have described the palaces of the emperor Justinian Frequent symptoms appeared that perfection in every work of taste was at no great distance Those clouds of ignorance which yet remained began now to be illuminated by the approach of the dawn of truth  SECT XXVII  THE reformation of our church produced an alteration for a time in the general system of study and changed the character and subjects of our poetry Every mind both learned and unlearned was busied in religious speculation and every pen was employed in recommending illustrating and familiarising the Bible which was now laid open to the people  The poetical annals of king Edward the sixth who removed those chains of bigottry which his brother Henry had only loosened are marked with metrical translations of various parts of the sacred scripture Of these the chief is the versification of the Psalter by Sternhold and Hopkins a performance which has acquired an importance and consequently claims a place in our series not so much from any merit of its own as from the circumstances with which it is connected  It is extraordinary that the protestant churches should be indebted to a country in which the reformation had never begun to make any progress and even to the indulgence of a society which remains to this day the grand bulwark of the catholic theology for a very distinguishing and essential part of their ritual  About the year Clement Marot a valet of the bedchamber to king Francis the first was the favorite poet of France This writer having attained an unusual elegance and facility of style added many new embellishments to the rude state of the French poetry It is not the least of his praises that La Fontaine used to call him his master He was the inventor  of the rondeau and the restorer of the madrigal but he became chiefly eminent for his pastorals ballads fables elegies epigrams and translations from Ovid and Petrarch At length being tired of the vanities of profane poetry or rather privately tinctured with the principles of Lutheranism he attempted with the assistance of his friend Theodore Beza and by the encouragement of the professor of Hebrew in the university of Paris a version of David's Psalms into French rhymes This translation which did not aim at any innovation in the public worship and which received the sanction of the Sorbonne as containing nothing contrary to sound doctrine he dedicated to his master Francis the first and to the Ladies of France In the dedication to the Ladies or  les Dames de France  whom he had often before addressed in the tenderest strains of passion or compliment he seems anxious to deprecate the raillery which the new tone of his versification was likely to incur and is embarrassed how to find an apology for turning saint Conscious of his apostacy from the levities of life in a spirit of religious gallantry he declares that his design is to add to the happiness of his fair readers by substituting divine hymns in the place of  chansons d' amour  to inspire their susceptible hearts with a passion in which there is no torment to banish that fickle and fantastic deity CUPID from the world and to fill their apartments with the praises not of the  little god  but of the true Jehovah  E voz doigts sur les espinettes  Pour dire SAINCTES CHANSONETTES  He adds that the golden age would now be restored when we should see the peasant at his plough the carman in the streets and the mechanic in his shop solacing their toils with psalms and canticles and the shepherd and sheperdess reposing in the shade and teaching the rocks to echo the name of the Creator  Le

Psalms soon eclipsed the brilliancy of his madrigals and sonnets Not suspecting how prejudicial the predominant rage of psalmsinging might prove to the antient religion of Europe the catholics themselves adopted these sacred songs as serious ballads and as a more rational species of domestic merriment Thy were the common accompaniments of the fiddle They were sold so rapidly that the printers could not supply the public with copies In the festive and splendid court of Francis the first of a sudden nothing was heard but the psalms of Clement Marot By each of the royal family and the principal nobility of the court a psalm was chosen and fitted to the balladtune which each liked best The dauphin prince Henry who delighted in hunting was fond of  Ainsi qu'on oit le cerf bruire

Navarre sung  Revenge moy pren le querelle  or  Stand up O Lord to revenge my quarrel  to  the air of a dance of Poitou  See Bayle'  DICT V MAROT  It was on very different principles that psalmody flourished in the gloomy court of Cromwell This fashion does not seem in the least to have diminished the gaiety and good humour of the court of Francis  At this period John Calvin in opposition to the discipline and doctrines of Rome was framing his novel church at Geneva in which the whole substance and form of divine worship was reduced to praying preaching and singing In the last of these three he chose to depart widely from the catholic usage and either because he thought that novelty was sure to succeed that the practice of antiphonal chanting was superstitious or that the people were excluded from bearing a part in the more solemn and elaborate performance of ecclesiastical music or that the old papistic hymns were unedifying or that verse was better remembered than prose he projected with the advice of Luther a species of religious song consisting of portions of the psalms intelligibly translated into the vernacular language and adapted to plain and easy melodies which all might learn and in which all might join This scheme either by design or accident was luckily seconded by the publication of Marot's metrical psalms at Paris which Calvin immediately introduced into his congregation at Geneva Being set to simple and almost monotonous notes by Guillaume de Franc they were soon established as the principal branch in that reformer's new devotion and became a characteristical mark or badge of the Calvinistic worship and profession Nor were they sung only in his churches They exhilarated the convivial assemblies of the Calvinists were commonly heard in the streets and accompanied the labours of the artificer The weavers and woollen manufacturers of Flanders many of whom left the loom and entered into the ministry are said to have been the capital performers into this science At length Marot's psalms formed an appendix to the catechism of Geneva and were interdicted to the catholics under the most  severe penalties In the language of the orthodox psalmsinging and heresy were synonimous terms  It was Calvin's system of reformation not only to strip religion of its superstitious and ostensible pageantries of crucifixes images tapers superb vestments and splendid processions but of all that was estimable in the sight of the people and even of every simple ornament every significant symbol and decent ceremony in a word to banish every thing from his church which attracted or employed the senses or which might tend to mar the purity of an abstracted adoration and of a mental intercourse with the deity It is hard to determine how Calvin could reconcile the use of singing even when purged from the corruptions and abuses of popery to so philosophical a plan of worship On a parallel principle and if any artificial aids to devotion were to be allowed he might at least have retained the use of pictures in the church But a new sect always draws its converts from the multitude and the meanest of the people who can have no relish for the more elegant externals Calvin well knew that the manufacturers of Germany were no judges of pictures At the same time it was necessary that his congregation should be kept in good humour by some kind of pleasurable gratification and allurement which might qualify and enliven the attendance on the more rigid duties of praying and preaching Calvin therefore intent as he was to form a new church on a severe model had yet too much sagacity to exclude every auxiliary to devotion Under this idea he permitted an exercise which might engage the affections without violating the simplicity of his worship and sensible that his chief resources were in the rabble of a republic and availing himself of that natural propensity which prompts even vulgar minds to express their more animated feelings in rhyme and music he conceived a mode of universal psalmody not too refined for common capacities and fitted to please the populace The rapid propagation of Calvin's religion and his numerous proselytes are a strong proof of his address in planning such a sort of service France  and Germany were instantly infatuated with a love of psalmsinging which being admirably calculated to kindle and diffuse the flame of fanaticism was peculiarly serviceable to the purposes of faction and frequently served as the trumpet to rebellion These energetic hymns of Geneva under the conduct of the Calvinistic preachers excited and supported a variety of popular insurrections they filled the most flourishing cities of the Lowcountries with sedition and tumult and fomented the fury which defaced many of the most beautiful and venerable churches of Flanders  This infectious frenzy of sacred song soon reached England at the very critical point of time when it had just embraced the reformation and the new psalmody was obtruded on the new English liturgy by some few officious zealots who favoured the discipline of Geneva and who wished to abolish not only the choral mode of worship in general but more particularly to suppress the TE DEUM BENEDICTUS MAGNIFICAT JUBILATE NUNC DIMITTIS and the rest of the liturgic hymns which were supposed to be contaminated by their long and antient connection with the Roman missal or at least in their prosaic form to be unsuitable to the new system of worship  Although Wyat and Surrey had before made translations of the Psalms into metre Thomas Sternhold was the first whose metrical version of the Psalms was used in the church of England Sternhold was a native of Hampshire and probably educated at Winchester college Having passed some time at Oxford he became groom of the robes to king Henry the eighth In this department either his diligent services or his knack at rhyming so pleased the king that his majesty bequeathed him a legacy of one hundred marks He continued in the same office under Edward the sixth and is said to have acquired some degree of reputation about the court for his poetry Being of a serious disposition and an enthusiast to reformation he was much offended at the lascivious ballads which prevailed among the courtiers and with a laudable design to check these indecencies undertook  a metrical version of the Psalter  "thinking thereby says Antony Wood that the courtiers would sing them instead of their sonnets  but did not  only some few excepted  ATH Oxon i  "  Here was the zeal if not the success of his fellow labourer Clement Marot A singular coincidence of circumstances is notwithstanding to be remarked on this occasion Vernacular versions for general use of the Psalter were first published both in France and England by laymen by courtpoets and by servants of the court Nor were the respective translations entirely completed by themselves and yet they translated nearly an equal number of psalms Marot having versified fifty and Sternhold fiftyone Sternhold died in the year His fiftyone psalms were printed the same year by Edward Whitchurch under the following title  "All such Psalms of David as Thomas Sternholde late grome of the kinges Maiestyes robes did in his ly  e tyme drawe into Englysshe metre"  They are without the musical notes as is the second edition in He probably lived to prepare the first edition for the press as it is dedicated by himself to king Edward the sixth  Cotemporary with Sternhold and his coadjutor was John Hopkins of whose life nothing more is known than that he was a clergyman and a schoolmaster of Suffolk and perhaps a graduate at Oxford about the year Of his abilities as a teacher of the classics he has left a specimen in some Latin stanzas prefixed to FOX'S MARTYROLOGY He is rather a better English poet than Sternhold and translated fifty eight of the psalms distinguished by the initials of his name  Of the rest of the contributors to this undertaking the chief at least in point of rank and learning was William Whyttingham promoted by Robert earl of Leicester to the deanery of Durham yet not without a strong reluctance to comply with the use of the canonical habiliments Among our religious exiles in the reign of Mary he was Calvin's principal  favorite from whom he received ordination So pure was his faith that he was thought worthy to succeed to the congregation of Geneva superintended by Knox the Scotch reformer who from a detestation of idols proceeded to demolish the churches in which they were contained It was one of the natural consequences of Whyttingham's translation from Knox's pastorship at Geneva to an English deanery that he destroyed or removed many beautiful and harmless monuments of antient art in his cathedral To a man who had so highly spiritualised his religious conceptions as to be convinced that a field a street or a barn were fully sufficient for all the operations of christian worship the venerable structures raised by the magnificent piety of our ancestors could convey no ideas of solemnity and had no other charms than their ample endowments Beside the psalms he translated  Among them is the hundreth and the hundred and nineteenth  all which bear his initials by way of innovating still further on our established formularly he versified the Decalogue the Nicene Apostolic and Athanasian Creeds the Lord's Prayer the TE DEUM the Song of the three Children with other hymns which follow the book of psalmody How the Ten Commandments and the Athanasian Creed to say nothing of some of the rest should become more edifying and better suited to common use or how they could receive improvement in any respect or degree by being reduced into rhym  it is not easy to perceive But the real design was to render that more tolerable which could not be entirely removed to accommodate every part of the service to the psalmodic tone and to clothe our whole liturgy in the garb of Geneva All these for he was a lover of music were sung in Whyttingham's church of Durham under his own directions Heylin says that from vicinity of situation he was enabled to lend considerable assistance to his friend Knox in the introduction of the presbyterian hierarchy into Scotland I must indulge the reader with a stanza or two of this dignified fanatic's divine poetry  from his Creeds and the Decalogue From the Athanasian Creed  The Father God is God the Son  God Holy Ghost  also  Yet are there not three Gods  in all  But one God and  no m    From the Apostolic Creed  From thence shall he come for to judge  All men both dead and quick  I in the holy ghost believe  And church that's catholick  The Ten Commandments are thus closed  Nor his manservant nor his maid  Nor oxe nor asse  of his  Nor any other thing that  to  Thy neighbour  proper is  These were also versified by Clement Marot  Twentyseven of the psalms were turned into metre by Thomas Norton  Marked N  who perhaps was better employed at least as a poet in writing the tragedy of GORDOBUCKE in conjunction with lord Buckhurst It is certain that in Norton's psalms we see none of those sublime strokes which sir Philip Sydney discovered in that venerable drama He was of Sharpenhoe in Bedfordshire a barrister and in the opinion and phraseology of the Oxford biographer a bold and busy Calvinist about the beginning of the reign of queen Elisabeth He was patronised by the Protector Somerset at whose desire he translated an epistle addressed by Peter Martyr to Somerset into English in Under the same patronage he probably tran  lated also Calvin's Institutes  Robert Wisdome a protestant fugitive in the calamitous reign of queen Mary afterwards archdeacon of Ely and who had been nominated to an Irish bishoprick by king Edward the sixth rendered the twentyfifth psalm of this version  See Strype's CRANMER p  PSALMS and are marked with W K PSALM with T C It is not known to whom thes  initials belong  But he is chiefly memorable for his metrical prayer intended to be sung in the church against the Pope and the Turk of whom he seems to have conceived the most alarming apprehensions It is probable that he thought popery and mahometanism were equally dangerous to christianity at least the most powerful and the sole enemies of our religion This is the first stanza  Preserve us Lord by thy dear word  From POPE and TURK defend us Lord  Which both would thrust out of thy throne  Our Lord Jesus Christ thy dear son  Happily we have hitherto survived these two formidable evils Among other orthodox wits the facetious bishop Corbet has ridiculed these lines He supposes himself seized with a sudden impulse to hear or to pen a puritanical hymn and invokes the ghost of Robert Wisdome as the most skilful poet in this mode of composition to come and assist But he advises Wisdome to steal back again to his tomb which was in Carfax church at Oxford silent and unperceived for fear of being detected and intercepted by the Pope or the Turk But I will produce Corbet's epigram more especially as it contains a criticism written in the reign of Charles the first on the style of this sort of poetry  TO THE GHOST OF ROBERT WISDOME  Thou once a body now but ayre  Archbotcher of a psalm or prayer  From Carfax come  And patch us up a zealous lay  With an old  ever and for ay  Or  all and some  Or such a spirit lend me  As may a hymne down sende me  To purge my braine  But Robert looke behind thee  Lest TURK or POPE do find thee  And go to bed againe  POEMS Lond duod p    The entire version of the psalter was at length published by John Day in attached for the first time to the common prayer and entitled  "The whole Booke of Psalmes collected into English metre by T Sternhold J Hopkins and others conferred with the Ebrue with apt Notes to  ing them withall"  Calvin's music was intended to correspond with the general parsimonious spirit of his worship not to captivate the passions and seduce the mind by a levity a variety or a richness of modulation but to infuse the more sober and unravishing ecstasies The music he permitted although sometimes it had wonderful effects was to be without grace elegance or elevation These apt notes were about forty tunes of one part only and in one unisonous key remarkable for a certain uniform strain of sombrous gravity and applicable to all the psalms in their turns as the stanza and sense might allow They also appear in the subsequent impressions particularly of and They are believed to contain some of the original melodies composed by French and German musicians Many of them particularly the celebrated one of the hundredth psalm are the tunes of Goudimel and Le Jeune who are among the first composers of Marot's French psalms  See this matte  traced with great skill and accuracy by Hawkins HIST MUS iii  Not a few were probably  imported by the protestant manufacturers of cloth of Flanders and the Low Countries who fled into England from the persecution of the Duke de Alva and settled in those counties where their art now chiefly flourishes It is not however unlikely that some of our own musicians who lived about the year and who could always tune their harps to the religion of the times such as Marbeck Tallis Tye Parsons and Munday were employed on this occasion yet under the restriction of conforming to the jejune and unadorned movements of the foreign composers I  resume much of the primitive harmony of all these antient tunes is now lost by additions variations and transpositions  This version is said to be  conferred with the Ebrue  But I am inclined to think that the translation was altogether made from the vulgate text either in Latin or English  It is evident that the prose psalms of our liturgy were chiefly consulted and copied by the perpetual assumption of their words and combinations many of the stanza  are literally nothing more than the proseverses put into rhyme As thus  Thus were they stained with the workes  Of their owne filthie way  And with their owne inve  tions did  A whoring go astray  PSALM cvi    Whyttingham however who had travelled to acquire the literature then taught in the foreign universities and who joined in the translation of Coverdale's Bible was undoubtedly a scholar and an adept in the Hebrew language  It is certain that every attempt to clothe the sacred Scripture in verse will have the effect of misrepresenting and debasing the dignity of the original But this general inconvenience arising from the nature of things was not the only difficulty which our versifiers of the psalter had to encounter in common  with all other writers employed in a similar task Allowing for the state of our language in the middle of the sixteenth century they appear to have been but little qualified either by genius or accomplishments for poetical composition It is for this reason that they have produced a translation entirely destitute of elegance spirit and propriety The truth is that they undertook this work not so much from an ambition of literary fame or a consciousness of abilities as from motives of piety and in compliance with the cast of the times I presume I am communicating no very new criticism when I observe that in every part of this translation we are disgusted with a languor of versification and a want of common prosody The most exalted effusions of thanksgiving and the most sublime imageries of the divine majesty are lowered by a coldness of conception weakened by frigid interpolations and disfigured by a poverty of phraseology Thomas Hopkins expostulates with the deity in these ludicrous at least trivial expressions  Why doost withdrawe thy hand aback  And hide it in thy lappe  O plucke it out and be not slack  To give thy foes a rappe  Ps lxxiv Perhaps this verse is not much improved in the translation of king James the first who seems to have rested entirely on the image of  why withdrawe  t thou not thine hand  which he has expressed in Hopkins's manner  Why dost thou thus withdraw thy hand  Even thy right hand restraine  Out of thy bosom for our good  Drawe backe the same againe  In another stanza he has preserved Hopkins's rhymes and expletives and if possible lowered his language and cadences Ps lxxiv  Oh why our God for ev  rmore  Hast thou neglected us  Why  smoaks  thy wrath against the sheep  Of thine owne pasture  thus  Here he has chiefly displayed the  smoking  of God's wrath which  kindles  in Hopkins The particle  thus  was never so distinguished and dignified And it is hard to say why his majesty should chuse to make the divine indignation  smoke  rather than  burn  which is suggested by the original    What writer who wished to diminish the might of the supreme Being and to expose the style and sentiments of Scripture  could have done it more skilfully than by making David call upon God not to  consume his enemies  by an irresistible blow but to give them a rap Although some shadow of an apology may be suggested for the word  rap  that it had not then acquired its present burlesque acceptation or the idea of a petty stroke the vulgarity of the following phrase in which the practice or profession of religion or more particularly God's covenant with the Jews is degraded to  a trade  cannot easily be vindicated on any consideration of the fluctuating sense of words  For why their hearts were nothing bent  To him nor to his  trade  Ps  lxviii    Nor is there greater delicacy or consistency in the following stanza  Confound them that apply  And seeke to worke my shame  And at my harme do laugh and cry  So So  there goeth the game  Ps  lxx    The psalmist says that God has placed the sun in the heavens  "which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber"  Here is a comparison of the sun rising to a bridegroom who according to the Jewish custom was ushered from his chamber at midnight with great state preceded by torches and music Sternhold has thus metrified the passage  Ps xix    In them the Lord made for the sun  A place of great renown  Who like a bridegroom ready trimm'd  Doth from his chamber come  The translator had better have spared his epithet to the bridegroom which even in the sense of  readydressed  is derogatory to  the idea of the comparison But  readytrimm'd  in the language of that time was nothing more than  freshshaved  Sternhold as often impairs a splendid description by an impotent redundancy as by an omission or contraction of the most important circumstances  The miraculous march of Jehovah before the Israelites through the wilderness in their departure from Egypt with other marks of his omnipotence is thus imaged by the inspired psalmist  "O God when thou wentest forth before the people when thou wentest through the wilderness the earth shook and the heavens dropped at the presence of God even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God who is the God of Israel Thou O God sentedst a gracious rain upon thine inheritance and refreshedst it when it was wearyThe chariots of God are twenty thousand even thousands of angels and the Lord is among them as in the holy place of Sinai"  Sternhold has thus represented these great ideas  When thou didst march before thy folk  The Egyptians from among  And brought them from the wildernes  Which was both wide and long  The earth did quake the  raine pourde downe  Heard were great claps of thunder  The mount Sinai shooke in such sorte  As it would cleave in sunder  Thy heritage with drops of rain  Abundantly was  washt  And  if so be  it barren was  By thee it was  refresht  God's  army is two millions  Of warriours  good and strong  The Lord also in Sinai  Is present them among  Ps lxviii seq    If there be here any merit it arises solely from preserving the expressions of the prose version And the translator would have done better had he preserved more and had given us no feeble or foreign enlargements of his own He has shewn no independent skill or energy When once he attempts to add or dilate his weakness appears It is this circumstance alone which supports the two following wellknown stanzas  Ps xviii    The Lord descended from above  And bowde the heavens high  And underneath his feet he cast  The darknesse of the skie  On Cherubs and on Cherubims  Full roiallie he rode  And on the winges of all the windes  Came flying all abrode  Almost the entire contexture of the prose is here literally transferred unbroken and without transposition allowing for the small deviations necessarily occasioned by the metre and rhyme It may be said that the translator has testified his judgment in retaining so much of the original and proved he was sensible the passage needed not any adventitious ornament But what may seem here to be judgment or even taste I fear was want of expression in himself He only adopted what was almost ready done to his hand  To the disgrace of sacred music sacred poetry and our established worship these psalms still continue to be sung in  the church of England It is certain had they been more poetically translated they would not have been acceptable to the common people Yet however they may be allowed to serve the purposes of private edification in administering spiritual consolation to the manufacturer and mechanic as they are extrinsic to the frame of our liturgy and incompatible with the genius of our service there is perhaps no impropriety in wishing that they were remitted and restrained to that church in which they sprung and with whose character and constitution they seem so aptly to correspond Whatever estimation in point of composition they might have attracted at their first appearance in a ruder age and however instrumental they might have been at the infancy of the reformation in weaning the minds of men from the papistic ritual all these considerations can now no longer support even a specious argument for their being retained From the circumstances of the times and the growing refinements of literature of course they become obsolete and contemptible A work grave serious and even respectable for its poetry in the reign of Edward the sixth at length in a cultivated age has contracted the air of an absolute travestie Voltaire observes that in proportion as good taste improved the psalms of Clement Marot inspired only disgust and that although they charmed the court of Francis the first they seemed only to be calculated for the populace in the reign of Lewis the fourteenth  HIST MOD ch ccvii    To obviate these objections attempts have been made from time to time to modernise this antient metrical version and to render it more tolerable and intelligible by the substitution of more familiar modes of diction But to say nothing of the unskilfulness with which these arbitrary corrections have been conducted by changing obsolete for known words the texture and integrity of the original style such as it was has been destroyed and many stanzas before too naked and weak like a  plain old Gothic edifice stripped of its few signatures of antiquity have lost that little and almost only strength and support which they derived from antient phrases Such alterations even if executed with prudence and judgment only corrupt what they endeavour to explain and exhibit a motley performance belonging to no character of writing and which contains more improprieties than those which it professes to remove Hearne is highly offended at these unwarrantable and incongruous emendations which he pronounces to be  abominable  in any book  "much more in a sacred work"  and is confident that were Sternhold and Hopkins  "now living they would be so far from owning what is ascribed to them that they would proceed against the innovators as CHEATS  GLOSS ROB GL p  "  It is certain that this translation in its genuine and unsophisticated state by ascertaining the signification of many radical words now perhaps undeservedly disused and by displaying original modes of the English language may justly be deemed no inconsiderable monument of our antient literature if not of our antient poetry In condemning the practice of adulterating this primitive version I would not be understood to recommend another in its place entirely new I reprobate any version at all more especially if intended for the use of the church  In the mean time not to insist any longer on the incompatibility of these metrical psalms with the spirit of our liturgy and the barbarism of their style it should b  remembered that they were never admitted into our church by lawful authority They were first introduced by the puritans and afterwards continued by connivance But they never received any royal approbation or parlia  entary sanction notwithstanding it is said in their title page that they are  "set forth and ALLOWED to be sung in all churches of all the people together before and after evening prayer and also before and after sermons and moreover in private houses for their godly solace and comfort  laying apart all ungodly songs and ballads which tend only to the nourishing of vice and the corrupting of youth"  At the beginning of the reign of queen Elisabeth when our ecclesiastical reformation began to be placed on a solid and durable establishment those English divines who had fled from the superstitions of queen Mary to Franckfort and Geneva where they had learned to embrace the opposite extreme and where from an abhorrence of catholic ceremonies they had contracted a dislike to the decent appendages of divine worship endeavoured in conjunction with some of the principal courtiers to effect an abrogation of our solemn church service which they pronounced to be antichristian and unevangelical They contended that the metrical psalms of David set to plain and popular music were more suitable to the simplicity of the gospel and abundantly adequate to all the purposes of edification and this proposal they rested on the authority and practice of Calvin between whom and the church of England the breach was not then so wide as at present But the queen and those bishops to whom she had delegated the business of supervising the liturgy among which was the learned and liberal archbishop Parker objected that too much attention had already been paid to the German theology She declared that the foreign reformers had before interpo  ed on  imilar deliberations with unbecoming forwardness and that the Common Prayer of her brother Edward had been once altered to quiet the scruples and to gratify the cavils of Calvin Bucer and Fagius She was therefore invariably determined to make no more concessions to the importunate partisans of Geneva and peremptorily decreed that the choral formalities should still be continued in the celebration of the sacred offices  See CANONS and INJUNCTIONS A D NUM xlix    SECT XXVIII  THE spirit of versifying the psalms and other parts of the Bible at the beginning of the reformation was almost as epidemic as psalmsinging William Hunnis a gentleman of the chapel under Edward the sixth and afterwards chapelmaster to queen Elisabeth rendered into rhyme many select psalms which had not the good fortune to be rescued from oblivion by being incorporated into Hopkins's collection nor to be sung in the royal chapel They were printed in with this title  "Certayne Psalmes chosen out of the Psalter of David and drawen furth into Englysh meter by William Hunnis servant to the ryght honourable syr William Harberd knight Newly collected and imprinted  I have also seen Hunnis's  "Abridgement or brief meditation on certaine of the Psalmes in English

of Sussex whose attachment to the gospel he much extols and who was afterwards the foundress of Sydney college in Cambridge Hunnis also under the happy title of a HANDFUL OF HONEYSUCKLES published  Blessings out of Deuteronomie Prayers to Christ Athanasius's Creed  and  Meditations  in metre with musical notes But his spiritual nosegays are numerous To say nothing of his RECREATIONS on  Adam's banishment Christ his Cribb  and the  Lost Sheep  he translated into English rhyme the whole book of GENESIS which he calls a HIVE FULL OF HONEY  Printed by T Marshe to  But his honeysuckles and his honey are now no longer delicious He was a large contributor to the PARADISE  OF DAINTY DEVISES of which more will be said in its place In the year were also published by John Hall or Hawle a surgeon or physician of Maidstone in Kent and author of many tracts in his profession  "Certayne chapters taken out of the proverbes of Solomon with other chapters of the holy Scripture and certayne Psalmes of David translated into English metre by John Hall  There is an edition i  quarto dedicated to king Edward the sixth with this title  "The Psalmes of David translated into English metre by T Sternhold sir T Wyat and William Hunnis with certaine chapters of the Proverbes and select Psalms by John Hall"  I think I have seen a book by Hall called the COURT OF VIRTUE containing some or all of these sacred songs with notes vo He has a copy of verses prefixed to Gale's ENCHI  IDION OF SU  GERY Lond See John Reade's Preface to his translation of F Arcaeus's ANATOMY  "  By the remainder of the title it appears that the proverbs had been in a former impression unfairly attributed to Thomas Sternhold The other chapters of Scripture are from Ecclesiasticus and saint Paul's Epistles We must not confound this John Hall with his cotemporary Eliseus Hall who pretended to be a missionary from heaven to the queen prophesied in the streets and wrote a set of metrical visions  Strype ANN i p ch xxv ed  Metre was now become the vehicle of enthusiasm and the puritans seem to have appropriated it to themselves in opposition to our service which was in prose  William Baldwyn of whom more will be said when we come to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES published a  Phraselike declaration in English meeter on the  CANTICLES or SONGS OF SOLOMON in It is dedicated to Edward the sixth  In quarto I have seen also  "The Ballads or Canticles of Solomon in Prose and Verse"  Without date or name of printer or author  Nineteen of the psalms in rhyme are extant by Francis Seagar printed by William Seres in with musical notes and dedicated to lord Russel  At the end is a poem entitled  "A Description of the Lyfe of Man the World and Vanities  hereof"  Princ  "Who on earth can justly rejoyce"    Archbishop Parker also versified the psalter not from any opposition to our liturgy but either for the private amusement and exercise of his religious exile or that the people whose  predilection for psalmody could not be suppressed might at least be furnished with a rational and proper translation It was finished in And a few years afterwards printed by Day the archbishop's printer in quarto with this title  "The whole Psalter translated into English metre which contayneth an hundredth and fifty psalmes The first Quinquagene  The second quinquagene follows fol The third and last fol    Quoniam

had a licence Jun to print the psalms in metre Ames p  or name of the translator In the metrical preface prefixed he tries to remove the objections of those who censured versifications of Scripture he pleads the comforts of such an employment to the persecuted theologist who suffers voluntary banishment and thus displays the power of sacred music  The psalmist stayde with tuned songe  The rage of myndes agast  As David did with harpe among  To Saule in fury cast  With golden stringes such harmonie  His harpe so sweete did wrest  That he relieved his phrenesie  Whom wicked sprites possest  He thus remonstrates against the secular ballads  Ye songes so nice ye sonnets all  Of lothly lovers layes  Ye worke mens myndes but bitter gall  By phansies peevish playes    Whatever might at first have been his design it is certain that his version although printed was never published and notwithstanding the formality of his metrical preface abovementioned  which was professedly written to shew the spiritual efficacy or virtue of the psalms in metre and in which he directs a distinct and audible mode of congregational singing he probably suppressed it because he saw that the practice had been abused to the purposes of fanaticism and  dopted by the puritans in contradiction to the national worship or at least that such a publication whatever his private sentiments might have been would not have suited the nature and dignity of his high office in the church Some of our musical antiquaries however have justly conjectured that the archbishop who was skilled in music and had formerly founded a musicschool in his college of Stoke Clare intended these psalms which are adapted to complicated tunes of four parts probably constructed by himself and here given in score for the use of cathedrals at a time when compositions in counterpoint were uncommon in the church and when that part of our choirservice called the motet or anthem which admits a more artificial display of harmony and which is recommended and allowed in queen Elisabeth's earliest ecclesiastical injunctions was yet almost unknown or but in a very imperfect state Accordingly although the direction is not quite comprehensible he orders many of them to be sung by the  rector chori  or chantor and the  quier  or choir alternately That at least he had a taste for music we may conclude from the following not inelegant scale of modulation prefixed to his eight tunes abovementioned  "THE NATURE OF THE EYGHT TUNES  The first is meke devout to see  The second sad in maiesty  The third doth rage and roughly brayth  The fourth doth fawne and flattry playth  The fifth deligth and laugheth the more  The sixt bewayleth it wepeth full sore  The seventh tredeth stoute in froward race  The eyghte goeth milde in modest pace"  What follows is another proof that he had proposed to introduce these psalms into the choirservice  "The tenor of these partes be for the people when they will syng alone the other partes put for the greater quiers or to suche as will syng or play them privately  As the singingpsalms were never a part of our liturgy no rubrical direction  are any where given for the manner of performing them In one of the PREFACES written about it is ordered  "Whereas heretofore there hath been great diversitie of saying and singing in churches within this realm some following Salisbury use some Hereford use some the use of Bangor some of York some of Lincoln now from henceforth all the whole realm shall have but one use"  But this is said in reference to the chants responds suffrages versicles introites kyrieeleeyso  s doxologies and other melodies of the Book of Common Prayer then newly published under lawful authority with musical notes by Marbeck and which are still used that no arbitrary variations should be made in the manner of singing these melodies as had been lately the case with the Roman missal in performing which some cathedrals affected a manner of their own The Salisbury mi  al was most famous and chie  ly followed  "  How far this memorable prelate perhaps the most accomplished scholar that had yet filled the archbishoprick of Canterbury has succeeded in producing a translation of the psalter preferable to the common one the reader may judge from these stanzas of a psalm highly poetical in which I have exactly preserved the translator's peculiar use of the hemistic punctuation  To feede my neede he will me leade  To pastures greene and fat  He forth brought me in libertie  To waters delicate  My soule and hart he did convart  To me he shewth the path  Of right wisness in holiness  His name such vertue hath  Yea though I go through Death his wo  His vale and shadow wyde  I feare no dart with me thou art  With rod and staffe to guide  Thou shalt provyde a table wyde  For me against theyr spite  With oyle my head thou hast bespred  My cup is fully dight  Fol    I add in the more sublime character a part of the eighteenth psalm in which Sternhold is supposed to have exerted his powers most successfully and without the interruptions of the pointing which perhaps was designed for some regulations of the music now unknown  The earth did shake for feare did quake  The hils theyr bases shooke  Removed they were in place most fayre  At God's ryght fearfull looke  Darke smoke rose to hys face therefro  Hys mouthe as fire consumde  That coales at it were kyndled bright  When he in anger fumde  The heavens full lowe he made to bowe  And downe dyd he ensue  Follow    And darkness great was undersete  His feete in clowdy hue  He rode on hye and dyd so flye  Upon the Cherubins  He came in sight and made his flight  Upon the wyng of wyndes  The Lorde from heaven sent downe his leaven  And thundred thence in ire  He thunder cast in wondrous blast  With hayle and coales of fyre  Fol    Here is some degree of spirit and a choice of phraseology But on the whole and especially for this species of stanza  Parker will be found to want facility and in general to have been unpractised in writing English verses His abilities were destined to other studies and adapted to employments of a more ar  hiepiscopal nature  The industrious Strype Parker's biographer after a diligent search never could gain a sight o  this translation nor is it even mentioned by Ames the inquisitive collector of our typographical antiquities In the late Mr West's library there was a superb copy once belonging to bishop Kennet who has remarked in a blank page that the archbishop permitted his wife dame Margaret to present the book to some of the nobility It is certainly at this time extremely scarce and would be deservedly deemed a fortunate acquisition to those capricious students who labour only to collect a library of rarities Yet it is not generally known that there are two copies in the Bodleian library of this anonymous version which have hitherto been given to an obscure po  t by the name of John Keeper One of them in appears to have been the property of bishop Barlow and on the opposite side of the title in somewhat of an antient hand is this manuscript insertion  "The auctor of this booke is one John Keeper who was brought upp in the close of Wells"  Perhaps Antony Wood had no better authority than this slender unauthenticated note for saying that John Keeper a native of Somersetshire and a graduate at Oxford in the year and who afterwards studied music and poetry at Wells  "translated  The whole Psalter into English metre which containeth    psalms etc printed at London by John Day living over Aldersgate  about in quarto and added thereunto The Gloria Patri Te Deum The Song of the three Children Quicunque vult Benedictus c all in m  tre At the end of which are musical notes set in four parts to several psalms What other things he adds of poetry music or other faculties he has published I know  not nor any thing more yet I suppose he had some dignity in the church of Wells  ATH OXON i  "  If this version should really be the work of Keeper I fear we are still to seek for archbishop Parker's psalms with Strype and Ames  There is a metrical English version of the Ps  lm

forward the reformation by the revival of a book which exposed the absurdities of popery in strong satire and which at present is only valuable or useful as it serves to gratify the harmless researches of those peaceable philosophers who study the progression of antient literature His pulpit and his press those two prolific sources of faction happily cooperated in propagating his principles of predestination and his shop and his sermons were alike frequented Possessed of those talents which qualified him for captivating the attention and moving the passions of the multitude under queen Elisabeth he held many dignities in a church whose doctrines and polity his undiscerning zeal had a tendency to destroy He translated into popular rhyme not only the psalter but the litany with hymns all which he printed together in In the same year and in the same measure he published  The Voice of the last Trumpet blown by the seventh angel  This piece contains twelve several lessons

He also attacked the abuses of his age in thirtyone EPIGRAMS first printed in The subjects are placed alphabetically In his first alphabet are  Abbayes Alehouses Alleys  and  Almeshouses  The second

to prove that Lent is a human invention and a superstitious institution deserves notice for its plan it is a Dialogue between Lent and Liberty The personification of Lent is a bold and a perfectly new prosopopeia In an old poem of this age against the papists written by one doctor William Turner a physician but afterwards dean of Wells the Mass or mistress MISSA is personified who arrayed in all her meretricious trappings must at least have been a more theatrical figure  See Strype ECC  MEM ii p S  the speakers in Ochin'  Di  logu  against the Pope englished by Poyne  printed in Strype ibid

Wood's time had been degraded to the stall of the balladsinger and is now only to be found on the shelf of the antiquary was intended to supersede or abolish the original Latin hymns which were only offensive because they were in Latin and which were the recreation of scholars in our universities after dinner on festival days At an archiepiscopal visitation of Merton college in Oxford in the year it was a matter of enquiry whether the  superstitious  hymns appointed to  be sung in the Hall on holidays were changed for the psalms in metre and one of the fellows is accused of having attempted to

Neale's HIST PURIT vol ii ch vii pag edit Nalson's COLLECTIONS vol i pag    SECT XXIX  BUT among the theological versifiers of these times the most notable is Christopher Tye a doctor of music at Cambridge in and musical preceptor to prince Edward and probably to his sisters the princesses Mary and Elisabeth In the reign of Elisabeth he was organist of the royal chapel in which he had been educated To his profession of music he joined some knowledge of English literature and having been taught to believe that rhyme and edification were closely connected and being persuaded that every part of the Scripture would be more instructive and better received if reduced into verse he projected a translation of the ACTS OF THE APOSTLES into familiar metre It appears that the BOOK OF KINGS had before been versified which for many reasons was more capable of shining under the hands of a translator But the most splendid historical book I mean the most susceptible of poetic ornament in the Old or New Testament would have become ridiculous when clothed in the fashionable ecclesiastical stanza Perhaps the plan of setting a narrative of this kind to music was still more preposterous and exceptionable However he completed only the first fourteen chapters and they were printed in by William Serres with the following title which by the reader who is not acquainted with the peculiar complexion of this period will hardly be suspected to be serious  "The ACTES OF THE APOSTLES translated into Englyshe metre and dedicated to the kinges most excellent maiestye by Cristofer Tye doctor in musyke and one of the  Gentylmen of hys graces most honourable Chappell with notes to eche chapter to synge and also to play upon the Lute very necessarye for studentes after theyr studye to fyle their wittes and alsoe for all christians that cannot synge to reade the good and godlye storyes of the lives of Christ his apostles"  It is dedicated in Sternhold's stanza  "To the vertuous and godlye learned prynce Edward the sixth"  As this singular dedication contains not only anecdotes of the author and his work but of his majesty's eminent attention to the study of the scripture and of his skill in playing on the lute I need not apologise for transcribing a few dull stanzas especially as they will also serve as a specimen of the poet's native style and manner unconfined by the fetters of translation  Your Grace may note from tyme to tyme  That some doth undertake  Upon the Psalms to write in ryme  The verse plesaunt to make  And some doth take in hand to wryte  Out of the Booke of Kynges  Because they se your Grace delyte  In suche like godlye thynges  Strype says that  "Sternhold composed several psalms at first for his own solace For he set and sung them to his organ Which music king Edward vi sometime hearing for he was a Gentleman of the privychamber was much delighted with them Which occasioned his publication and dedication of them to the said king"  ECCLES MEMOR B i ch p    And last of all I youre poore man  Whose doinges are full base  Yet glad to do the best I can  To give unto your Grace  Have thought it good now to recyte  The stories of the Actes

character of which we have seldom heard But he proceeds  That such good thynges your Grace might move  Your Lute when ye assaye  In stede of songes of wanton love  These stories then to play  So shall

preache"  From this sample of his original vein my reader will not perhaps hastily predetermine that our author has communicated any considerable decorations to his ACTS OF THE APOSTLES in English verse There is as much elegance and animation in the two following initial stanzas of the fourteenth chapter as in any of the whole performance which I shall therefore exhibit  It chaunced in Iconium  As they  Apostles  oft tymes did use  Together they into did come  The Sinagoge of Jues  Where they did preache and only seke  God's grace them to atcheve  That so they speke to Jue and Greke  That many did bileve  Doctor Tye's ACTS OF THE APOSTLES were sung for a time in the royal chapel of Edward the sixth But they never became popular The impropriety of the design and the impotency of the execution seem to have been perceived even by his own prejudiced and undiscerning age This circumstance however had probably the fortunate and seasonable effect of  turning Tye's musical studies to another and a more rational system to the composition of words judiciously selected from the prose psalms in four or five parts Before the middle of the reign of Elisabeth at a time when the more ornamental and intricate music was wanted in our service he concurred with the celebrated Tallis and a few others in setting several anthems which are not only justly supposed to retain much of the original strain of our antient choral melody before the reformation but in respect of harmony expression contrivance and general effect are allowed to be perfect models of the genuine ecclesiastic style Fuller informs us that Tye was the chief restorer of the loss which the music of the church had sustained by the destruction of the monasteries  WORTHI  S ii Tallis here mentioned at the begin  ing of the reign of Elisabeth and by proper authority enriched the music of Marbeck's liturgy He set to music the T  DEUM BENEDICTUS MAGNIFICAT NUNC DIMITTIS and other offices to which Marbeck had given only the  canto fi  mo  or plain chant He composed a new Litany still in use and improved the simpler modulation of Marbeck's Suffrages Kyries after the Commandments and other versicle  as they are sung at pres  nt There are two chants of Tallis one to the VENITE EXULTEMUS and another to the Athanasian Cre  d  Tye also appears to have been a translator of Italian  The History of Nastagio and Traversari translated out of Italian into English by C T  perhaps Christopher Tye was printed at London in  In duod  cimoI had almost forgot to observe that John Mardiley  clerk of the king's Mint

the same subject and in rhyme presented and dedicated to queen Elisabeth MSS R  B xxxvii The Protector Somerset was his patron    It is not my intention to pursue any farther the mob of religious rhymers who from principles of the most unfeigned piety devoutly laboured to darken the lustre and enervate the force of the divine pages And perhaps I have been already too prolix in examining a species of poetry if it may be so called which even impoverishes prose or rather by mixing the stile of prose with verse and of verse with prose destroys  the character and effect of both But in surveying the general course of a species of literature absurdities as well as excellencies the weakness and the vigour of the human mind must have their historian Nor is it unpleasing to trace and to contemplate those strange incongruities and false ideas of perfection which at various times either affectation or caprice or fashion or opinion or prejudi  e or ignorance or enthusiasm present to the conceptions of men in the shape of truth  I must not however forget that king Edward the sixth is to be ranked among the religious poets of his own reign Fox has published his metrical instructions concerning the eucharist addressed to sir Antony Saint Leger Bale also mentions his comedy called the WHORE OF BABYLON which Holland the heroologist who perhaps had never seen it and knew not whether it was a play or a ballad in verse or prose pronounces to be a most elegant perfo  mance  HEROOLOG p  Its elegance with some will not perhaps apologise or atone for its subject and it may seem strange that controversial ribaldry should have been suffered to enter into the education of a great monarch But the genius habits and situation of his age should be considered The reformation was the great political topic of Edward's court Intricate discussions in divinity were no longer confined to the schools or the clergy The new religion from its novelty as well as importance interested every mind and was almost the sole object of the general attention Men emancipated from the severities of a spiritual tyranny reflected with horror on the slavery they had so long suffered and with exultation on the triumph they had obtained These feelings were often expressed in a strain of enthusiasm The spirit of innovation which had seized the times often transgressed the bounds of truth Every change of religion is attended with those ebullitions which growing more moderate by degrees afterwards appear eccentric and ridiculous  We who live at a distance from this great and national struggle between popery and protestantism when our church has been long and peaceably established and in an age of good sense of politeness and philosophy are apt to view these effusions of royal piety as weak and unworthy the character of a king But an ostentation of zeal and example in the young Edward as it was natural so it was necessary while the reformation was yet immature It was the duty of his preceptors to impress on his tender years an abhorrence of the principles of Rome and a predilection to that happy system which now seemed likely to prevail His early diligence his inclination to letters and his seriousness of disposition seconded their active endeavours to cultivate and to bias his mind in favour of the new theology which was now become the fashionable knowledge These and other amiable virtues his cotemporaries have given young Edward in an eminent degree But it may be presumed that the partiality which youth always commands the specious prospects excited by expectation and the flattering promises of religious liberty secured to a distant posterity have had some small share in dictating his panegyric  The new settlement of religion by counteracting inveterate prejudices of the most interesting nature by throwing the clergy into a state of contention and by disseminating theological opinions among the people excited so general a ferment that even the popular ballads and the stage were made the vehicles of the controversy between the papal and protestant communions  See instances already given before the Reformation had actually taken place supr p    The Ballad of LUTHER the POPE a CARDINAL and a HUSBANDMAN written in in defence of the reformation has some spirit and supports a degree of character in the speakers There is another written about the same time which is a lively satire on the English Bible the vernacular liturgy and the book of homilies  See Percy BALL ii  The measure of the last is that of  PIERCE PLOWMAN with the addition of rhyme a sort of versification which now was not uncommon  Strype has printed a poem called the PORE HELP of the year which is a lampoon against the new preachers or gospellers not very elegant in its allusions and in Skelton's style The anonymous satirist mentions with applause  Mayster Huggarde  or Miles Hoggard a shoemaker of London and who wrote several virulent pamphlets against the reformation which were made important by extorting laboured answers from several eminent divines  One of these pieces is  "A Confutation to the answer of a wicked ballad"  printed in Crowley abovementioned wrote  "A Confutation of Miles Hoggar  's wicked ballad made in defence of the transubstantiation of the Sacrament"  Lond octavo  He also mentions a  nobler clarke  whose learned  Balad

collection of these fugitive religious pasquinades which died with their respective controversies  In the year a proclamation was published to prohibit preaching This was a t  mporary expedient to suppress the turbulent harangues of the catholic ministers who still composed no small part of the parochial clergy for the court of augmentations took care perpetually to supply the vacant benefices with the disincorporated monks in order to exonerate the exchequer from the payment of their annuities These men both from inclination and interest and hoping to restore the church to its antient orthodoxy and opulence exerted all their powers of declamation in combating the doctrines of protestantism  and in alienating the minds of the people from the new doctrines and reformed rites of worship Being silenced by authority they had recourse to the stage and from the pulpit removed their polemics to the playhouse Their farces became more successful than their sermons The people flocked eagerly to the playhouse when deprived not only of their antient pageantries but of their pastoral discourses in the church Archbishop Cranmer and the protector Somerset were the chief objects of these dramatic invectives  Fuller CH HIST B vii Cent xvi p  At length the same authority which had checked the preachers found it expedient to controul the players and a new proclamation which I think has not yet appeared in the history of the British drama was promulgated in the following terms  Dat Edw vi Aug  The inquisitive reader will observe that from this instrument plays appear to have been long before a general and familiar species of entertainment that they were acted not only in London but in the great towns that the profession of a player even in our present sense was common and established and that these satirical interludes are forbidden only in the English tongue  "Forasmuch as a great number of those that be COMMON PLAYERS of ENTERLUDES and PLAYES as well within the city of London as elsewhere within the realm doe for the most part play such ENTERLUDES as contain matter tending to sedition and contemning of sundry good orders and laws whereupon are grown and daily are likely to growe and ensue much disquiet division tumults and uprores in this realm  It should however be remarked that the reformers had themselves shewn the way to this sort of abuse long before Bale's comedy OF THE THREE LAWS printed in is commonly supposed to be a Mys  ery and merely doctrinal but it is a satirical play again  t  opery and perhaps the  rst of the kind in our language I have

 many of the impostures of popery it became an object of the legislature to curb the bold and seditious spirit of popular poetry No sooner were the Scriptures translated and permitted in English than they were brought upon the stage they were not only misinterpreted and misunderstood by the multitude but profaned or burlesqued in comedies and mummeries Effectually to restrain these abuses Henry who loved to create a subject for persecution who commonly proceeded to disannul what he had just confirmed and who found that a freedom of enquiry tended to shake his ecclesiastical supremacy framed a law that not only Tyndale's English Bible and all the printed English commentaries expositions annotations defences replies and sermons whether orthodox or heretical which it had occasioned should

apprentices journeymen and servingmen are to be punished with one month's imprisonment as often as they are detected in reading the Bible either privately or openly  It should be observed that few of

British Museum there is a beautiful manuscript on vellum of a French translation of the Bible which was found in the  ent of king John king of France after the battle of Poictiers Perhaps hi  m  jesty poss  ssed this book on the plan of an exclusive royal right  Undoubtedly the duchesses and countesses of this age if not from principles of piety at least from motives of curiosity became eager to read a book which was made  inaccessible to three parts of the nation But the partial distribution of a treasure to which all had a right could not long remain This was a MANNA to be  gathered by every man  The claim of the people was too powerful to be overruled by the bigottry the prejudice or the caprice of Henry  I must add here in reference to my general subject that the translation of the Bible which in the reign of Edward the sixth was admitted into the churches is supposed to have fixed our language It certainly has transmitted and perpetuated many antient words which would otherwise have been obsolete or unintelligible I have never seen it remarked that at the same time this translation contributed to enrich our native English at an early period by importing and familiarising many Latin words  More particularly in the Latin derivative substantives such as  divination perdition adoption manifestatio  consolation contribution administration consummation reconciliation operation communication retribution preparation immortality principality  c c And in other words  frustrate inexcusable tran  figure concupiscence  c c    These were suggested by the Latin vulgate which was used as a medium by the translators Some of these however now interwoven into our common speech could not have been understood by many readers even above the rank of the vulgar when the Bible first appeared in English Bishop Gardiner had therefore much less reason than we now imagine for complaining of the too great clearness of the translation when with an insidious view of keeping the people in their antient ignorance he proposed that instead of always using English phrases many Latin words should still be preserved because they contained an inherent significance and a genuine dignity to which the common tongue afforded no correspondent expressions of sufficient energy  Such as  Idololatria contritus holocausta sacramentum elementa humilitas satisfactio ceremonia absolutio mysterium penitentia  c See Gardiner's proposals in Burnet HIST REF vol i B iii p And Fuller CH HI  T B v Cent xvi p    To the reign of Edward the sixth belongs Arthur Kelton a native of

time when all things"  Wood allows that he was an able antiquary but laments that he  "being withall poetically given must forsooth write and publish his lucubrations in verse whereby for rhime's sake many material matters and the due timing of them are omitted and so consequently rejected by historians and antiquarians  ATH OXON i  "  Yet he has not supplied his want of genealogical and historical precision with those strokes of poetry which his subject suggested nor has his imagination been any impediment to his accuracy At the end of his CRONICLE is the GENEALOGY OF THE BRUTES in which the pedigree of king Edward the sixth is lineally drawn through thirtytwo generations from Osiris the first king of Egypt Here too Wood reproaches our author for his ignorance in genealogy But in an heraldic enquiry so difficult and so new many mistakes are pardonable It is extraordinary that a Welshman should have carried his genealogical researches into Egypt or rather should have wished to prove that Edward was descended from Osiris but this was with a design to shew that the Egyptian monarch was the original progen  tor of Brutus the undoubted founder of Edward's family Bale says that

violent from the poetry of the puritans to a convivial and  ungodlie  ballad  I cannot eat but little meat  My stomach is not good  But sure I think that I can drink  With him that weares a hood  A monk    Though I go bare take ye no care  I nothing am a colde  I stuffe my skin so full within  Of joly goode ale and olde  Backe and side go bare go bare  Booth foot and hand go colde  But belly God send thee good ale inoughe  Whether it be new or olde  I love no rost but a nutbrowne toste  And a crab laid in the fire  A little bread shall do me stead  Moche bread I noght desire  No frost no snow no winde I trowe  Can hurt me if I wolde  I am so wrapt and throwly lapt  Of joly good ale and olde  Backe and side c  And TIB my wife that as her life  Loveth well good ale to seeke  Full oft drinkes shee till ye may see  The teares run downe her cheeke  Then doth she trowle to me the bowle  Even as a maultworm sholde  And  Having drank sh  says  "saith sweet heart I tooke my part  "Of this joly

sowles that have scoured bowles  Or have them lustely trolde  God save the lives  of them and their wives  Whether they be yong or olde  Backe and side c  This song opens the second act of GAMMER GURTON'S NEEDLE a comedy written and printed in  On the authority of MSS Oldys A valuable blackletter copy in the possession of Mr Steevens i  the oldest I have seen  and soon afterwards acted at Christ's College in Cambridge In the title of the old edition it is said to have been written  "by Mr S master of artes"  who probably was a member of that society This is held to be the first comedy in our language that is the first play which was neither Mystery nor Morality and which handled a comic story with some disposition of plot and some dis  rimination of character  See supr vol ii p  The writer has a degree of jocularity which sometimes rises above buffoonery but is often disgraced by lowness of incident Yet in a more polished age he would have chosen nor would he perhaps have disgraced a better subject It has been thought surprising that a learned audience could have endured some of these indelicate scenes But the established festivities of scholars were gross and agreeable to their general habits nor was learning in that age always accompanied by gentleness of manners When the sermons of Hugh Latimer were in vogue at court the university might be justified in applauding GAMMER GURTON'S NEEDLE  SECT XXX  TRUE genius unseduced by the cabals and unalarmed by the dangers of faction defies or neglects those events which destroy the peace of mankind and often exerts its operations amidst the most violent commotions of a state Without patronage and without readers I may add without models the earlier Italian writers while their country was shook by the intestine tumults of the Guelfes and Guibelines continued to produce original compositions both in prose and verse which yet stand unrivalled The age of Pericles and of the Peloponnesian war was the same Careless of those who governed or disturbed the world and superior to the calamities of a quarrel in which two mighty leaders contended for the prize of universal dominion Lucretius wrote his sublime didactic poem on the system of nature Virgil his bucolics and Cicero his books of philosophy The proscriptions of Augustus did not prevent the progress of the Roman literature  In the turbulent and unpropitious reign of queen Mary when controversy was no longer confined to speculation and a spiritual warfare polluted every part of England with murthers more atrocious than the slaughters of the most bloody civil contest a poem was planned although not fully completed which illuminates with no common lustre that interval of darkness which occupies the annals of English poetry from Surrey to Spenser entitled A MIRROUR FOR MAGISTRATES  More writers than one were concerned in the execution of this piece but its primary inventor and most distinguished  contributor was Thomas Sackville the first lord Buckhurst and first earl of Dorset Much about the same period the same author wrote the first genuine English tragedy which I shall consider in its proper place  Sackville was born at Buckhurst a pricipal seat of his antient and illustrious family in the parish of Withiam in Sussex His birth is placed but with evident inaccuracy under the year  Archbishop Abbot in Sackville's Funeralsermon says he was aged when he died in the year If so he was not twenty years of age when h  wrote GORDOBUCK  At least it should be placed six years before Discovering a vigorous understanding in his childhood from a domestic tuition he was removed as it may reasonably be conjectured to Harthall now Hertford college in Oxford But he appears to have been a master of Arts at Cambridge  Wood ATH OXON i    At both universities he became celebrated as a Latin and English poet and he carried his love of poetry which he seems to have almost solely cultivated to the Inner Temple It was now fashionable for every young man of fortune before he began his travels or was admitted into parliament to be initiated in the study of the law But instead of pursuing a science which could not be his profession and which was unaccommodated to the bias of his genius he betrayed his predilection to a more pleasing species of literature by composing the tragedy just mentioned for the entertainment and honour of his fellowstudents His high birth however and ample patrimony soon advanced him to more important situations and employments His eminent accomplishments and abilities having acquired the confidence and esteem of queen Elisabeth the poet was soon lost in the statesman and negotiations and embassies extinguished the milder ambitions of the ingenuous Muse Yet it should be remembered that he was uncorrupted amidst the intrigues of an artful court that in the character of a first minister he preserved the integrity of a private man and that his family refused the offer of an apology to his memory when it was insulted by the malicious  insinuations of a rival party Nor is it foreign to our purpose to remark that his original elegance and brilliancy of mind sometimes broke forth in the exercise of his more formal political functions He was frequently disgusted at the pedantry and official barbarity of style with which the public letters and instruments were usually framed and Naunton relates that his  "secretaries had difficulty to please him he was so  facete  and choice in his style  FRAGM REGAL p  "  Even in the decisions and pleadings of that rigid tribunal the starchamber which was never esteemed the school of rhetoric he practiced and encouraged an unaccustomed strain of eloquent and graceful oratory on which account says Lloyd  "so flowing was his invention that he was called the starchamber bell  Lloyd'  WO  THI  S p  "  After he was made a peer by the title of lord Buckhurst and had succeeded to a most extensive inheritance and was now discharging the business of an envoy to Paris he found time to prefix a Latin epistle to Clerke's Latin translation of Castilio's COURTIER printed at London in which is not an unworthy recommendation of a treatise remarkable for its polite Latinity It was either because his mistress Elisabeth paid a sincere compliment to his singular learning and fidelity or because she was willing to indulge an affected fit of indignation against the object of her capricious passion that when Sackville in was a candidate for the chancellorship of the university of Oxford she condescended earnestly to sollicit the university in his favour and in opposition to his competitor the earl of Essex At least she appears to have approved the choice for her majesty soon afterwards visited Oxford where she was entertained by the new chancellor with splendid banquets and much solid erudition It is neither my design nor my province to develope the profound policy with which he conducted a peace with Spain the address with which he penetrated or baffled the machinations of Essex and the circumspection and success with which he managed the  treasury of two opulent sovereigns I return to Sackville as a poet and to the history of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES  Many of his L  tter  are in the CA  ALA And in the university register at Oxford Mar see his Letter about the Habits  See also Howard'  COLL p    About the year he formed the plan of a poem in which all the illustrious but unfortunate characters of the English history from the conquest to the end of the fourteenth century were to pass in review before the poet who descends like Dante into the infernal region and is conducted by SORROW Although a descent into hell had been suggested by other poets the application of such a fiction to the present design is a conspicuous proof of genius and even of invention Every personage was to recite his own misfortunes in a separate soliloquy But Sackville had leisure only to finish a poetical preface called an INDUCTION and one legend which is the life of Henry Stafford duke of Buckingham Relinquishing therefore the design abruptly and hastily adapting the close of his INDUCTION to the appearance of Buckingham the only story he had yet written and which was to have been the last in his series he recommended the completion of the whole to Richard Baldwyne and George Ferrers  Baldwyne seems to have been graduated at Oxford about the year He was an ecclesiastic and engaged in the education of youth I have already mentioned his metrical version of SOLOMON'S SONG dedicated to king Edward the sixth  See supr  His patron was Henry lord Stafford  Ut in  r He wrote also  Three book  s of M  ral Philosop  y  And  The Liv  and Sayings of Philosoph

informs us that he was patronised by lord Cromwell  Fol  He was in parliament  under Henry the eighth and in imprisoned by that whimsical tyrant perhaps very unjustly and for some cabal now not exactly known About the same time in his juridical capacity he translated the MAGNA CHARTA from French into Latin and English with some other statutes of England  For Robert Redman No date After At the end he is called George Ferrerz In duodecimo Redman printed MA  NA CHARTA in French Duodecim oblong  In a scarce book William Patten's  Expedition into Scotlande of the most woorthely fortunate

following passage that he was of the suite of the protector Somerset  "George Ferrers a gentleman of my lord Protectors and one of the commissioners of the carriage of this army"  He is said to have compiled the history of queen Mary's reign which makes a part of Grafton's CHRONICLE  Stowe CHRON p  He was a composer almost by profession of occasional interludes for the diversion of the court and in being then a member of Lincolnsinn he bore the office of LORD OF MISRULE at the royal palace of Greenwich during the twelve days of Christmas Stowe says  "George Ferrers gentleman of Lincolnsinn

MAGISTRATES"  fol None of his plays which Puttenham says  "were written with much skill and magnificence in his meter and wherein the king had so much good recreation that he had thereby many good rewards"  are now remaining and as I suppose were never printed He died and was buried in the church of Bade  leyClinton in Warwickshire He was of Warwickshire and educated at Oxford See Philip  's TH

church of Kilgarran in Pembrokeshire  Baldwyne and Ferrers perhaps deterred by the greatness of the attempt did not attend to the series prescribed by Sackville but inviting some others to their assistance among which are Churchyard and Phayer chose such lives from the newly published chronicles of Fabyan and Hall as seemed to display the most affecting catastrophes and which very probably were pointed out by Sackville The civil wars of York and Lancaster which Hall had compiled with a laborious investigation of the subject appear to have been their chief resource  These legends with their authors including Sackville's part are as follows Robert Tresilian chief Justice of England in by Ferrers The two Mortimers surnamed Roger in and by Baldwyne Thomas of Woodstock duke of

these events were at that time too well known  to become the proper subject of poetry and must have lost much of their solemnity by their notoriety But Shakespeare has been guilty of the same fault The objection however is now worn away and age has given a dignity to familiar circumstances  This collection or set of poems was printed in quarto in with the following title  "A MYRROVRE FOR

of the publication may be collected from Baldwyne's DEDICATION TO THE NOBILITIE prefixed  "The wurke was begun and parte of it prynted in Queene Maries tyme but hyndred by the Lord Chancellour that

although I have been called to another trade of lyfe yet my good lord Stafford hath not ceassed to call upon me to publyshe so much as I had gotten at other mens hands so that through his lordshyppes earnest meanes I have now also set furth another parte conteyning as little of myne owne as the fyrst parte doth of other mens  SIGNAT C ii  "  The plan was confessedly borrowed from Boccace's DE CASIBUS  PRINCIPUM a book translated as we have seen by Lydgate but which never was popular because it had no English examples But Baldwyne's scope and conduct with respect to this and other circumstances will best appear from his Preface which cannot easily be found and which I shall therefore insert at large  "When the printer had purposed with him  elfe to printe Lydgate's booke of the FALL OF PRINCES and had made pryvye therto many both honourable and worshipfull he was counsayled by dyvers of them to procure to have the story contynewed from where as Bochas left unto this present time chiefly of such as Fortune had dalyed with in this ylandeWhich advyse lyked him so well that he requyred me to take paines therin But because it was a matter passyng my wit and skyll and more thankles than gaineful to meddle in I refused utterly to undertake it except I might have the help of suche as in wit were apte in learnyng allowed and in judgement and estymacyon able to wield and furnysh so weighty an enterpryse thinkyng even so to shift my handes But he earnest and diligent in his affayres procured Atlas to set under his shoulder For shortly after divers learned men whose manye giftes nede fewe prayses consented to take upon them parte of the travayle And when certaine of them to the numbre of seven were through a general assent at an appoynted tyme and place gathered together to devyse thereupon I resorted unto them bearing the booke of Bochas translated by Dan Lidgate for the better observation of his order Which although we liked wel yet would it not cumly serve seeing that both Bochas and Lidgate were dead neither were there any alive that meddled with like argument to whom the UNFORTUNATE might make make their mone To make therefore a state mete for the matter they all agreed that I should usurpe Bochas rowme and the WRETCHED PRINCES complayne unto me and take upon themselves every man for his parte to be sundry personages and in their behalfes to bewaile unto ME their  greevous chances heavye destinies and wofull misfortunes This done we opened such bookes of Cronicles as we had there present And maister Ferrers after he had found where Bochas left which was about the ende of kinge Edwarde the thirdes raigne to begin the matter sayde thus"  "I marvayle what Bochas meaneth to forget among his MISERABLE PRINCES such as wer of our nacion whose numbre is as great as their adventures wunderfull For to let passe all both Britons Danes and Saxons and to come to the last Conquest what a sorte are they  How many they are  l  ude Crew  and some even in his Boccace's owne time As for example king Richard the fyrst slayne with a quarle  Q  ar  ll The bol  of a cros  bow  in his chyefe prosperitie Also king John his brother as sum saye poysoned Are not their histories rufull and of rare example But as it should appeare he being an Italian minded most the Roman and Italike story or els perhaps he wanted our countrey Cronicles It were therefore a goodly and a notable matter to search and discourse our whole story from the first beginning of the inhabiting of the yle But seeing the printer's minde is to have us folowe where Lidgate left we will leave that great labour to other that may intend it and as blinde Bayard is alway boldest I will begyn at the time of Rychard the second a time as unfortunate as the ruler therein And forasmuch frend Baldwyne as it shal be your charge to note and pen orderlye the whole proces I will so far as my memorie and judgemente serveth sumwhat further you in the truth of the storye And therefore omittinge the ruffle of Jacke Strawe and his meyney  Mu  and the murther of manye notable men which therby happened for Jacke as ye knowe was but a  poore prynce  I will begin with a notable example which within a while after ensued And although he be no Great Prynce yet sithens he had a princely office I will take upon me the miserable person of syr ROBERT TRESILIAN  chyefe justyce of England and of other which suffered with him Therby to warne all of his authoritye and profession to take hede of wrong judgements misconstruynge of lawes or wresting the same to serve the princes turnes which ryghtfully brought theym to a miserable ende which they may justly lament in manner ensuing  SI  NAT A  ii  "  Then follows sir ROBERT TRESILIAN'S legend or history supposed to be spoken by himself and addressed to Baldwyne  Here we see that a company was feigned to be assembled each of which one excepted by turns personates a character of one of the great Unfortunate and that the stories were all connected by being related to the silent person of the assembly who is like the chorus in the Greek tragedies or the Host in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales The whole was to form a sort of dramatic interlude including a series of independent soliloquies A continuity to this imagined representation is preserved by the introduction after every soliloquy of a prose epilogue which also serves as a prologue to the succeeding piece and has the air of a stagedirection Boccace had done this before We have this interposition which I give as a specimen and which explains the method of the recital between the tragedies of king RICHARD THE SECOND and OWEN GLENDOUR  "Whan he had ended this so wofull a tragedye and to all PRINCES a right worthy instruction we paused having passed through a miserable tyme full of pyteous tragedyes And seyng the reygne of Henry the fourth ensued a man more ware and prosperous in hys doynges although not untroubled with warres both of outforthe and inward enemyes we began to serch what Pyers peers were fallen therein wherof the number was not small and yet because theyr examples were not muche to be noted for our purpose we passed over all the Maskers of whom kynge Rycharde's brother was chiefe whych were all slayne and put to death for theyr trayterous  attempt And fyndynge Owen Glendoure next one of Fortune's owne whelpes and the Percyes his confederates I thought them unmete to be overpassed and therefore sayd thus to the sylent cumpany What my maysters is every one at once in a browne study and hath no man affection to any of these storyes You mynd so much some other belyke that those do not move you And to say the trouth there is no special cause why they should Howbeyt Owen Glendoure becaus he was one of Fortune's darlynges rather than he should be forgotten I will tel his tale for him under the privelidge of Martine hundred Which OWEN cuming out of the wilde mountains lyke the Image of Death in al pointes his darte onlie excepted so sore hath famyne and hunger consumed hym may lament his folly after this maner"  This process was a departure from Sackville's idea who supposes as I have hinted the scene laid in hell and that the unfortunate princes appeared to him in succession and uttered their respective complaints at the gates of Elysium under the guidance of SORROW  Many stanzas in the legends written by Baldwyne  That is Baldwyne had previously prepared and written his l  gend or monologue and one of the company was to act his part and assume this appearance  fol xviii  b  and Ferrers and their friends have considerable merit and often shew a command of language and versification  These lines in COLLINGBOURNE'S legend are remarkable fol cxliiii a  Like Pegasus a poet must have wynges  To slye to heaven or where him liketh best  He must have knowledge of eternal thynges  Almighti  Jove must harbor in his brest  But their performances have not the pathos which the subject so naturally suggests They give us yet often with no common degree of elegance and perspicuity the chronicles of Hall and Fabyan in verse I shall therefore in examining this part of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES confine my criticism to Sackville's INDUCTION and Legend of Buckingham  SECT XXXI  SACKVILLE'S INDUCTION which was to have been placed at the head of our English tragical story and which loses much of its dignity and propriety by being prefixed to a single life and that of no great historical importance is opened with the following poetical landscape of winter  See fol cxvi    The wrathfull winter prochinge on apace  With blustring blasts had all ybard the treene  And old Saturnus with his frosty face  With chilling colde had pearst the tender greene  The mantels rent wherein enwrapped been  The gladsom groves that nowe laye overthrowen  The tapets torne and every bloom downe blowne  The soile that earst so seemly was to seen  Was all despoyled of her beauty's hewe  And soote freshe flowres wherewith the sommers queen  Had clad the earth now Boreas blastes downe blewe  And small fowles flocking in theyr song did rewe  The winters wrath wherewith eche thinge defaste  In wofull wise bewayld the sommer paste  Hawthorne had lost his motley lyverye  The naked twigges were shivering all for colde  And droppinge downe the teares abundantly  Eche thing methought with weping  ye me tolde  The cruell season bidding me witholde  Myselfe within for I was gotten out  Into the feldes where as I walkt about  When loe the night with mistie mantels spred  Gan darke the daye and dim the azure skies c  The altered scene of things the flowers and verdure of summer deformed by the frosts and storms of winter and the day suddenly overspread with darkness remind the poet of the uncertainties of human life the transient state of honour and the instability of prosperity  And sorrowing I to see the sommer flowers  The lively greene the lusty leas forlorne  The sturdy trees so shattred with the showers  The fieldes so fade that floorisht so beforne  It taught we wel all earthly thinges be borne  To dye the death for nought long time may last  If sommors beauty yeelds to winters blast  Then looking upwards to the heavens beams  With nightès starres thickpowdred every where  Which erst so glistened with the golden streames  That chearfull Phebus spred downe from his sphere  Beholding darke oppressing day so neare  The sodayne sight reduced to my mynde  The sundry chaunges that in earth we fynde  Immediately the figure of SORROW suddenly appears which shews the poet in a new and bolder mode of composition  And strayt forth stalking with redoubled pace  For that I sawe the night drew on so fast  In black all clad there fell before my face  A piteous wight whom woe had all forwast  Furth from her iyen the crystall teares outbrast  And syghing sore her haunds she wronge and folde  Tare al her haire that ruth was to beholde  Her body small forwithered and forespent  As is the stalke that sommers drought opprest  Her wealked face with wofull teares besprent  Her colour pale and as it seemed her best  In woe and playnt reposed was her rest  And as the stone that droppes of water weares  So dented were her cheekes with fall of teares  I stoode agast beholding all her plight  Tween dread and dolour so distreynd in hart  That while my heares upstarted with the sight  The teares outstreamde for sorowe of her smatt  But when I sawe no ende that could aparte  The deadly dole which she so sore dyd make  With dolefull voyce then thus to her I spake  Unwrap thy woes whatever wight thou be  And stint betime to spill thyselfe with playnt  Tell what thou art and whence for well I see  Thou canst not dure with sorowe thus attaynt  And with that worde of sorrowe all forfaynt  She looked up and prostrate as she laye  With piteous sounde lo thus she gan to saye  Alas I wretche whom thu  thou  eest distrayned  With wasting woes that never shall aslake  SORROWE I am in endeles tormentes payned  Among the Furies in the infernall lake  Where Pluto god of hell so grieslie blake  Doth holde his throne and Lethes deadly taste  Doth reive remembrance of  che thyng forepast  Whence come I am the drery destinie  And luckles lot for to bemone of those  Whom Fortune in this maze of miserie  Of wretched chaunce most wofull myrrours chose  That when thou  ee  t how lightly they did lose  Theyr pompe theyr power and that they thought most sure  Thou mayest soon deeme no earthlye joye may dure  SORROW then conducts the poet to the classical hell to the place of torments and the place of happiness  I shall thee guyde first to the griesly lake  And thence unto the blissfull place of rest  Where thou shalt see and heare the playnt they make  That whilom here bare swinge  Sway  among the best  This shalt thou see But great is the unrest  That thou must byde before thou canst attayne  Unto the dreadfull place where those remayne  And with these wordes as I upraysed stood  And gan to folowe her that straight forth paste  Ere I was ware into a desert wood  We nowe were come where hand in hand embraced  She led the way and through the thicke so traced  As but I had beene guyded by her might  It was no waye for any mortal wight  But loe while thus amid the desert darke  We passed on with steppes and pace unmeete  A rumbling roar confusde with howle and barke  Of dogs shooke all the grounde under our feete  And strooke the din within our eares so deepe  As half distraught unto the ground I fell  Besought returne and not to visit hell  An hydeous hole al vast withouten shape  Of endles depth orewhelmde with ragged stone  With oughly mouth and griesly jawes doth gape  And to our sight confounds itself in one  Here entred we and yeding  Going  forth anone  An horrible lothly lake we might discerne  As black as pitche that cleped  Called  is Averne  A deadly gulfe where nought but rubbish growes  With fowle blake swelth in thickened lumpes that lyes  Which upp in th' ayre such stinking vapour throwes  That over there may flye no fowle but dyes  Choakt with the noysom vapours that aryse  Hither we come whence forth we still did pace  In dreadfull feare amid the dreadfull place  Our author appears to have felt and to have conceived with true taste that very romantic part of Virgil's Eneid which he has here happily copied and heightened The imaginary beings which sate within the porch of hell are all his own I must not omit a single figure of this dreadful groupe nor one compartment of the portraitures which are feigned to be sculptured or painted on the SHIELD of WAR indented  with gashes deepe and wide  And first within the porch and jaws of hell  Sat deep REMORSE OF CONSCIENCE all besprent  With tears and to herself oft would she tell  Her wretchedness and cursing never stent  To sob and sigh but ever thus lament  With thoughtful care as she that all in vain  Would wear and waste continually in pain  Her eyes unstedfast rolling here and there  Whirl'd on each place as place that vengeance brought  So was her mind continually in fear  Tost and tormented with the tedious thought  Of those detested crimes which she had wrought  With dreadful cheer and looks thrown to the sky  Wishing for death and yet she could not die  Next saw we DREAD all trembling how he shook  With foot uncertain profer'd here and there  Benumb'd with speech and with a gastly look  Search'd every place all pale and dead for fear  His cap born up with with staring of his hair  'Stoin'd and amazed at his own shade for dread  And

clouts and patches pieced one by one  With staff in hand and scrip on shoulders cast  His chief defence against the winter's blast  His food for most was wild fruits of the tree  Unless sometime some crums fell to his share  Which in his wallet long God wot kept he  As on the which full daint'ly would he fare  His drink the running stream his cup the bare  Of his palm closed his bed the hard cold

where nature him assign'd  To rest when that the sisters had untwin'd  His vital th  ad and ended with their knife  The fleeting course of fastdeclining life  There heard we him with broken and hollow plaint  Rue with himself his end approaching fast  And all for nought his wretched mind torment  With sweet remembrance of his pleasures past  And fresh delights of lusty youth forewaste  Recounting which how would he sob and shriek  And to be young again of JOVE beseek  But an' the cruel fates so fixed be  That time forepast cannot return again  This one request of JOVE yet prayed he  That in such wither'd plight and wretched pain  As eld accompany'd with her lothsome train  Had brought on him all were it woe and grief  He might a while yet linger forth his lief  And not so soon descend into the pit  Where Death when he the mortal corpse hath slain  With rechless hand in grave doth cover it  Thereafter never to enjoy again  The gladsome light but in the ground ylain  In depth of darkness waste and wear to nought  As he had ne'er into the world been brought  But who had seen him sobbing how he stood  Unto himself and how he would bemoan  His youth forepastas though it wrought

roar'd for meat as she should there have dy'd  Her body thin and bare as any bone  Whereto was left nought but the case alone  And that alas was gnaw'n on every where  All full of holes that I ne

shade  Than any substance of a creature made  Great was her force whom stonewall could not stay  Her tearing nails snatching at all she saw  With gaping jaws that by no means ymay  Be satisfy'd from hunger of her maw  But eats herself as she that hath no law  Gnawing alas her carkass all in vain  Where you may count each sinew bone and vein  On her while we thus firmly fix'd our eyes  That bled for ruth of such a dreary sight  Lo suddenly she shright in so huge wise  As made hell gates to shiver with the might  Wherewith a dart we saw how it did light  Right on her breast and therewithal pale DEATH  Enthrilling it to reve her of her b  eath  And by and by a dumb dead corpse we saw  Heavy and cold the shape of Death aright  That daunts all earthly creatures to his law  Against whose

never wight  Could have set forth the half not half so fine  I can no more but tell how there is seen  Fair ILIUM fall in burning red gledes down  And from the soil great Troy NEPTUNUS' town  These shadowy inhabitants of hellgate are conceived with the vigour of a creative imagination and described with great force of expression They are delineated with that fulness of proportion that invention of picturesqu  tributes distinctness animation and amplit  de of which Spenser is commonly supposed to have given the first specimens in our language and which are characteristical of his poetry We may venture to pronounce that Spenser at least caught his manner of designing allegorical personages from this model which so greatly enlarged the former narrow bounds of our ideal imagery as that it may justly be deemed an original in that style of painting For we must not forget that it is to this INDUCTION that Spenser alludes in a sonnet prefixed to his Pastorals in addressed  To the right honourable  THE LORD OF BUCKHURST  one of her maiesties priuie councell  In vaine I thinke right honourable lord  By this rude rime to memorize thy name  Whose learned Muse hath writ her owne record  In golden verse worthy immortal fame  Thou much more fit were leisure for the same  Thy gracious soveraignes prayses to compile  And her imperiall m  jestie to frame  In loftie numbers and heroick stile  The readers of the FAERIE QUEENE will easily point out many particular passages which Sackville's INDUCTION suggested to Spenser  From this scene SORROW who is well known to Charon and to Cerberus the  hideous hound of hell  leads the poet over the loathsome lake of  rude  Acheron to the dominions of Pluto which are described in numbers too beautiful to have been relished by his cotemporaries or equalled by his successors  Thence come we to the horrour and the hell  The large great kyngdomes and the dreadful raygne  Of Pluto in his trone where he dyd dwell  The wide waste places and the hugie playne  The waylinges shrykes and sundry sorts of payne  The syghes the sobbes the depe and deadly groane  Earth ayer and all resounding playnt and moane  The two next stanzas ar

lovers dead  That slew themselves when nothing else avayl'd  A thousand sorts of sorrows here that wayl'd  With sighs and teares sobs shricks and all yfere  That O alas it was a hell to here c    Thence did we passe the threefold emperie  To the utmost boundes where Rhadamanthus raignes  Where proud folke waile their wofull miserie  Where dreadfull din of thousand dragging chaines  And baleful shri  kes of ghosts in deadly paines  Torturd eternally are heard most brim  Breme i  curel  Through silent shades of night so darke and dim  From hence upon our way we forward passe  And through the groves and uncoth pathes we goe  Which leade unto the Cyclops walles of brasse  And where that mayne broad flood for aye doth floe  Which parts the gladsome fields from place of woe  Whence none shall ever passe t' Elizium plaine  Or from Elizium ever turne againe  Here they are surrounded by a troop of men  the most in armes bedight  who met an untimely death and of whose destiny whether they were sentenced to  eternal night  or to  blissfull peace  it was uncertain  Loe here quoth SORROWE Princes of renowne  That whilom sate on top of Fortune's wheele  Now laid full low like wretches whurled

respective merits and genius of different poets than a juxtaposition of their performances on similar subjects Having examined at large Sackville's Descent into Hell for the sake of throwing a still stronger light on his manner of treating a fiction which gives so large a scope to fancy I shall employ the remainder of this Section in setting before my reader a general view of Dante's Italian poem entitled COMMEDIA containing a description of Hell Paradise and Purgatory and written about the year In the mean time I presume that most of my readers will recollect and apply the sixth Book of Virgil to which however it may be necessary to refer occasionally  Although I have before insinuated that Dante has in this poem used the ghost of Virgil for a mystagogue in imitation of Tully who in the SOMNIUM Scipionis supposes Scipio to have shewn the other world to his ancestor Africanus yet at the same time in the invention of his introduction he seems to have had an eye on the exordium of an old forgotten Florentine  poem called TESORETTO written in  Frottola  or a short irregular measure exhibiting a cyclopede of theoretic and practic philosophy and composed by his preceptor Brunetto Latini about the year  See supr vol ii  Brunetto supposes himself lost in a wood at the foot of a mountain covered with animals flowers plants and fruits of every species and subject to the supreme command of a wonderful Lady whom he thus describes  "Her head touched the heavens which served at once for a veil and an ornament The sky grew dark or serene at her voice and her arms extended to the extremities of the earth  See supr vol ii  "  This bold personification one of the earliest of the rude ages of poetry is NATURE She converses with the poet and describes the creation of the world She enters upon a most unphilosophical and indeed unpoetical detail of the physical system developes the head of man and points out the seat of intelligence and of memory From physics she proceeds to morals but her principles are here confined to theology and the laws of the church which she couches in technical rhymes  Brunetto's TESORETTO was abstracted by himself from his larger prose work on the same subject written in old French and never printed entitled TESORO See supr vol ii And HIST ACAD INSCRIPT tom vii seq The TESORO was afterwards translated into Italian by one Bono Giamboni and printed at Trevisa viz  "IL T  SORO di Messer Brunetto Latino Fiorentino Precettore del divino poeta Dante nel qual si tratta di tutte le cose che a mortali se appartengeno  In Trivisa  fol After a table of chapters is another title  "Qui inchomincia el Tesoro di S Brunetto Latino di firenze e parla del nascimento e della natura di tutte le cose"  It was printed again at Venice by Marchio Sessa octavo Mabillon seems to have confounded this Italian translation with the French original IT ITALIC p See also Salviat  AVERTIS DECAM ii xii Dante int  oduces Brunetto in the fifteenth Can  o of the INFERNO and after the colophon of the first edition of the Italian TESORO abovementioned is this insertion  "Risposta di Dante a Brunetto Latino ritrovado da lui nel quintodecimo canto nel suo inferno"  The TESORETTO or Little Treasure mentioned above in the text has been printed but is exceedingly scarce    Dante like his master Brunetto is bewildered in an unfrequented forest He attempts to climb a mountain whose summit is illuminated by the rising sun A furious leopard pressed by hunger and a lion at whose aspect the  air is affrighted  accompanied by a shewolf oppose his progress and force him  to fly precipitately into the profundities of a pathless valley where says the poet  the sun was silent  Mi ripingeva dove'l sol tace  INF CANT i The same bold metaphor occurs below CANT v  Evenni in luogo d'ogni LUCE MUTO    In the middle of a vast solitude he perceives a spectre of whom he implores pity and help The spectre hastens to his cries it was the shade of Virgil whom Beatrix Dante's mistress had sent to give him courage and to guide him into the regions of hell  See supr vol ii p  Virgil begins a long discourse with Dante and expostulates with him for chusing to wander through the rough obscurities of a barren and dreary vale when the top of the neighbouring mountain afforded every delight The conversation of Virgil and the name of Beatrix by degrees dissipate the fears of the poet who explains his situation He returns to himself and compares this revival of his strength and spirits to a flower smitten by the frost of a night which again lifts its shrinking head and expands its vivid colours at the first gleamings of the morningsun  Qual' il fioretti dal notturno gelo  Chinati et chiusi c  CANT ii In another part of the INFERNO Virgil is angry with Dante but is soon reconciled H  re the poet compares himself to a cottager in the early part of a promising spring who looks out in the morning from his humble shed and see  the fields covered with a severe and unexpected frost But the sun soon melts the ground and he drives his goats a  ield CANT xxiv This poem abound  in comparisons Not one of the worst is a comic one in which a person looking sharply and eagerly is compared to an old taylor threading a needle INP CANT xv    Dante under the conduct of Virgil penetrates hell But he does not on this occasion always avail himself of Virgil's descriptions and mythologies At least the formation of Dante's imageries are of another school He feigns his hell to be a prodigious and almost bottomless abyss which from its aperture to its lowest depth preserves a rotund shape or rather an immense  perpendicular cavern which opening as it descends into different circles forms so many distinct subterraneous regions We are struck with horror at the commencement of this dreadful adventure  The first object which the poet perceives is a gate of brass over which were inscribed in characters of a dark hue  di colore oscuro  these verses  Per me si và nella città dolente  Per me si và nel eterno dolore  Per me si và trà la perduta gente  Giustizia mosse'l mio alto fattore  Fece me li divina potestate  La somma Sapienzia e l'primo Amore  He means the Platonic  The Italian expositors will have it to be the Holy Ghost    Dinanzi a me non fur cose create  Se non eterne el io duro eterno  Lassate ogni speranza voi ch'entraste  CANT iii    That is  "By me is the way to the woeful city By me is the way to the eternal pains By me is the way to the damned race My mighty maker was divine Justice and Power the Supreme Wisdom and the First Love Before me nothing was created If not eternal I shall eternally remain Put away all hope ye that enter"  There is a severe solemnity in these abrupt and comprehensive sentences and they are a striking preparation to the scenes that ensue But the idea of such an inscription on the brazen portal of hell was suggested to Dante by books of chivalry in which the gate of an impregnable enchanted castle is often inscribed with words importing the dangers or wonders to be found within Over the door of every chamber in Spenser's necromantic palace of Busyrane was written a threat to the champions who presumed to attempt to enter  FAIR QU iii xi  This total exclusion of hope from  hell here so finely introduced and so forcibly expressed was probably remembered by Milton a disciple of Dante where he describes  Regions of sorrow dolefull shades where peace  And rest can never dwell HOPE NEVER COMES  THAT COMES TO ALL  PAR L i    I have not time to follow Dante regularly through his dialogues and adventures with the crouds of ghosts antient and modern which he meets in the course of this infernal journey In these interviews there is often much of the party and politics of his own times and of allusion to recent facts Nor have I leisure particularly to display our author's punishments and phantoms I observe in general that the groundwork of his hell is classical yet with many Gothic and extravagant innovations The burning lakes the fosses and fiery towers which surround the city of DIS and the three Furies which wait at its entrance are touched with new strokes  See CANT ix vii  The Gorgons the Hydra the Chimera Cerberus the serpent of Lerna and the rest of Virgil's or rather Homer's infernal apparitions are dilated with new touches of the terrible and sometimes made ridiculous by the addition of comic or incongruous circumstances yet without any intention of burlesque Because Virgil had mentioned the Harpies in a single word only  Gorgones HARPYIAEQUE vi  in one of the lothsome groves which Dante passes consisting of trees whose leaves are black and whose knotted boughs are hard as iron the Harpies build their nests  CANT xiii    Non frondi verdi ma di color fosco  Non rami schietti ma nodosi e'nvolti  Non pomi v'eran ma stecchi con tosco  Cacus whom Virgil had called  Semifer  in his seventh book  appears in the shape of a Centaur covered with curling snakes and on whose neck is perched a dragon hovering with expanded wings  CANT xxv  It is supposed that Dante took the idea of his INFERNO from a magnificent nightly representation of hell exhibited by the pope in honour of the bishop of Ostia on the river Arno at Florence in the year This is mentioned by the Italian critics in extenuation of Dante's choice of so strange a subject But why should we attempt to excuse any absurdity in the writings or manners of the middle ages Dante chose this subject as a reader of Virgil and Homer The religious MYSTERY represented on the river Arno however magnificent was perhaps a spectacle purely orthodox and perfectly conformable to the ideas of the church And if we allow that it might hint the subject with all its inconsistencies it never could have furnished any considerable part of this wonderful compound of classical and romantic fancy of pagan and christian theology of real and fictitious history of tragical and comic incidents of familiar and heroic manners and of satirical and sublime poetry But the grossest improprieties of this poem discover an originality of invention and its absurdities often border on sublimity We are surprised that a poet should write one hundred cantos on hell paradise and purgatory But this prolixity is partly owing to the want of art and method and is common to all early compositions in which every thing is related circumstantially and without rejection and not in those general terms which are used by modern writers  Dante has beautifully enlarged Virgil's short comparison of the souls lingering on the banks of Lethe to the numerous leaves falling from the trees in Autumn  Come d'Autumno si levan le foglie  L'un appresso del'altra infin che'l ramo  Vede a la terre tutte le sue spoglie  Similmente il mal seme d'Adamo  Getta si di quel lito ad una ad una  Per cenni com'augel per suo richiamo  CANT iii    In the Fields inhabited by unhappy lovers he sees Semiramis Achilles Paris and Tristan or sir Tristram One of the old Italian commentators on this poem says that the last was an English knight born in  Cornovaglio  or Cornwall a city of England  In the sixteenth Canto of the PARADISO king Arthur's queen GENEURA who belongs to  ir Tristram's romance is mentioned    Among many others of his friends he sees Francisca the daughter of Guido di Polenta in whose palace Dante died at Ravenna and Paulo one of the sons of Malatesta lord of Rimini This lady fell in love with Paulo the passion was mutual and she was betrothed to him in marriage but her family chose rather that she should be married to Lanciotto Paulo's eldest brother This match had the most fatal consequences The injured lovers could not dissemble or stifle their affection they were surprised and both assassinated by Lanciotto Dante finds the shades of these distinguished victims of an unfortunate attachment at a distance from the rest in a region of his INFERNO desolated by the most violent tempests He accosts them both and Francisca relates their history yet the conversation is carried on with some difficulty on account of the impetuosity of the storm which was perpetually raging Dante who from many circumstances of his own amours appears to have possessed the most refined sensibilities about the delicacies of love enquires in what manner when in the other world they first communicated their passion to each other Francisca answers that they were one day sitting together and reading the romance of LANCELOT where two lovers were represented in the same critical situation with themselves Their changes of colour and countenance while they were reading often tacitly betrayed  their yet undiscovered feelings When they came to that passage in the romance where the lovers after many tender approaches are gradually drawn by one uniform reciprocation of involuntary attraction to kiss each other the book dropped from their hands By a sudden impulse and an irresistible sympathy they are tempted to do the same Here was the commencement of their tragical history  Noi leggiavam' un giorno per diletto  Di LANCILOTTO comme amor le strinse  Soli eravamo et senza alcun sospetto  Per più fia  e gli occhi ci sospinse  Quella lettura et scolorocc' il viso  Ma sol un punto fù qual che ci vinse  Quando legemmo il disiato riso  Esser baciato dà cotanto amante  Questi che mai da me no fia diviso  La bocca mi basciò tutto tremante  GALEOTTO  He is one of the knights of the Round Table and is commonly called Sir GALHAAD in ARTHUR'S romance  fù il libro et chi lo scrisse  Quel giorno più non vi legemmo avante  CANT v    But this picture in which nature sentiment and the graces are concerned I have to contrast with scenes of a very different nature Salvator Rosa has here borrowed the pencil Correggio Dante's beauties are not of the soft and gentle kind  Through many a dark and dreary vale  They pass'd and many a region dolorous  O'er many a frozen many a fiery Alp  Milton PAR L ii    A hurricane suddenly rising on the banks of the river Styx is thus described  Et gia venia sù per le torbid onde  Un fracasso d'un suon pien di spavento  Per cui tremavan amendue le sponde  Non altrimenti fatto che d'un vento  Impetuoso per gli avversi ardori  Che fier la salva senz' alcun rattento  Gli rami schianta i abatte et porta i fiori  Dinanzi polveroso và superbo  Et fa fuggir le fiere et glipastori  CANT ix    Dante and his mystagogue meet the monster Geryon He has the face of a man with a mild and benign aspect but his human form ends in a serpent with a voluminous tail of immense length terminated by a sting which he brandishes like a scorpion His hands are rough with bristles and scales His breast back and sides have all the rich colours displayed in the textures of Tartary and Turkey or in the labours of Arachne To speak in Spenser's language he is  A dragon horrible and bright  FAIR QU i ix    No monster of romance is more savage or superb  Lo dosso e'l petto ad amenduo le coste  Dipinte avea di nodi e di rotelle  Con più color sommesse e soppraposte  Non fur ma  in drappo Tartari ne Turchi  Ne fur tar tale per Aragne imposte  CANT xvii Dante says that he  ay on the banks of a river like a Beaver the CASTOR But this foolish comparison is affectedly introduced by our author for a display of his natural knowledge from Pliny or rather from the TESORO of his m  ster Brunetto    The conformation of this heterogeneous beast as a fabulous hell is the subject perhaps immediately gave rise to one of  the  formidable shapes  which sate on either side of the gates of hell in Milton Although the fiction is founded in the cla  ics  The one seem'd woman to the waste and fair  But ended foul in many a scaly fold  Voluminous and vast a serpent arm'd  With mortal sting  PAR L ii    Virgil seeming to acknowledge him as an old acquaintance mounts the back of Geryon At the same time Dante mounts whom Virgil places before  "that you may not says he be exposed to the monster's venomous sting"  Virgil then commands Geryon not to move too rapidly  "for consider what a new burthen you carry"  "Gerion muoviti omai  "Le ruote large e lo scender sia poco  "Pensa la nuova soma che tu hai  CANT xvii  "  In this manner they travel in the air through Tartarus and from the back of the monster Geryon Dante looks down on the burning lake of Phlegethon This imagery is at once great and ridiculous But much later Italian poets have fallen into the same strange mixture In this horrid situation says Dante  I sentia già dalla man destra il gorgo  Far sotto noi un orribile stroscio  Perche con gli occhi in giù la testa sporsi  Allor fu io più timido allo scoscio  Perioch i vidi fuochi e sente pianti  Oud' io tremando tutto mi rancosco  Ibid    This airy journey is copied from the flight of Icarus and Phaeton and at length produced the Ippogrifo of Ariosto Nor  is it quite improbable that Milton although he has greatly improved and dignified the idea might have caught from hence his fiction of Satan soaring over the infernal abyss At length Geryon having circuited the air like a faulcon towering without prey deposits his burthen and vanishes  In the thirtyfourth CANTO Dante and Virgil return to light on the back of Lucifer who like Milton's Satan ii is described as having wings like sails  Vele di mar non vid' io mai est celi  And again  Quando l'ale  uro aperte assai  This Canto begins with a Latin line  Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni    While they are wandering along the banks of Phlegethon as the twilight of evening approaches Dante suddenly hears the sound of a horn more loud than thunder or the horn of Orlando  Or Roland the subject of archbishop Turpin's romance See supr vol i    Ma io senti sonare alto corno  Non sono si terribilimente Orlando  CANT xxxi    Dante descries through the gloom what he thinks to be many high and vast towers  molte alti torri  These are the giants who warred against heaven standing in a row half concealed within and half extant without an immense abyss or pit  Gli orribili giganti cui minaccia  Giove del cielo ancora quando tuona  Ibid    But Virgil informs Dante that he is deceived by appearances and that these are not towers but the giants  Sappi che non son torri ma giganti  E son nel pezzo intorno della ripa  D'all umbilico in guiso tutti quanti  Ibid    One of them cries out to Dante with horrible voice Another Ephialtes is cloathed in iron and bound with huge chains  Dante wishes to see Briareus he is answered that he lies in an interior cavern biting his chain Immediately Ephialtes arose from another cavern and shook himself like an earthquake  Non fu tremuoto già tanto rubesto  Che schotesse una torri cosi forte  Come Fialte a scuotersi fu presto  Ibid    Dante views the horn which had sounded so vehemently hanging by a leathern thong from the neck of one of the giants Antaeus whose body stands ten ells high from the pit is commanded by Virgil to advance They both mount on his shoulders and are thus carried about Cocytus The giant says the poet moved off with us like the mast of a ship  Dante says if I understand the passage right that the face of one of the giants resembled the Cupola shaped like a pineapple of saint Peter's church at Rome ibid CANT xxxi  Come la pina di san Pietro a Roma  One cannot help observing what has been indeed already hinted how judiciously Milton in a similar argument has retained the just beauties and avoided the childish or l  dicrous excesses of these bold inventions At the same time we may remark how Dante has sometimes heightened and sometimes diminished by improper additions or misrepresentations the legitimate descriptions of Virgil  One of the torments of the Damned in Dante's INFERNO is the punishment of being eternally confined in lakes of ice  Eran l'ombre dolenti nell ghiaccia  Mettendo i denti in nota di cicogna  CANT xxxii    The ice is described to be like that of the Danube or Tanais This species of infernal torment which is neither directly warranted by scripture nor suggested in the systems of the Platonic fabulists and which has been adopted both by Shakespeare and  Milton has its origin in the legendary hell of the monks The hint seems to have been taken from an obscure text in the Book of JOB dilated by saint Jerom and the early commentators  JOB xxiv  The torments of hell in which the punishment by cold is painted at large had formed a visionary romance under the name of saint Patrick's Purgatory or Cave long before Dante wrote  See supr vol ii And ADD EMEND ibid  The venerable Bede who lived in the seventh century has framed a future mansion of existence for departed souls with this mode of torture In the hands of Dante it has assumed many fantastic and grotesque circumstances which make us laugh and shudder at the same time  In another department Dante represents some of his criminals rolling themselves in human ordure If his subject led him to such a description he might at least have used decent expressions But his diction is not here less sordid than his imagery I am almost afraid to transcribe this gross passage even in the disguise of the old Tuscan phraseology  Quindi giù nel fos  o  Vidi gente attuffata in uno sterco  Che dagli uman privati para mosso  Et mentre che laggiu con l'occhio cerco  Vidi un co'l capo si da merda lordo  Che non  parea s'era laico o cherco  CANT xviii    The humour of the last line does not make amends for the nastiness of the image  It is not to be supposed that a man of strong sense and genius whose understanding had been cultivated by a most exact education and who had passed his life in the courts of sovereign princes would have indulged himself in these disgusting fooleries had he been at all apprehensive that his readers would have been disgusted But rude and early poets desc  ib  every thing They follow the public manners and if they are either obscene or indelicate it should be remembered that they wrote before obscenity or indelicacy became offensive  Some of the Guilty are made objects of contempt by a transformation into beastly or ridiculous shapes This was from the fable of Circe In others the human figure is rendered ridiculous by distortion There is one set of criminals whose faces are turned round towards their backs  E'l piante de gli occhi  Le natiche bagnava per lo fesso  CANT xx    But Dante has displayed more true poetry in describing a real event than in the best of his fictions This is in the story of Ugolino count of Pisa the subject of a very capital picture by Reynolds The poet wandering through the depths of hell sees two of the Damned gnawing the sculls of each other which was their daily food He enquires the meaning of this dreadful repast  La bocca sollevò dal fiero pasto  Quel peccator forbendola a capelli  Del capo ch'egli havea di retro guasto  CANT xxxiii They are both in the lake of ice    Ugolino quitting his companion's halfdevoured scull begins his tale to this effect  "We are Ugolin count of Pisa and archbishop Ruggieri Trusting in the perfidious counsels of Ruggieri I was brought to a miserable death I was committed with four of my children to the dungeon of hunger The time came when we expected food to be brought Instead of which I heard the gates of the horrible tower more closely barred I looked at my children and could not speak  "L'hora s'appressava  "Che'l cibo ne soleva essere adotto  "E per suo sogno ciascun dubitava  "Ed io senti chiavar l'uscio di sotto  "A l'ORRIBILE TORRE ond'io guardai  "Nel viso à miei figliuoli senza far metta  "I could not complain I was petrified My children cried and my little Anselm  Anselmuccio mio  said  Father you look on us what is the matter  "Tu guardi si padre che hai"  I could neither weep nor answer all that day and the following night When the scanty rays of the sun began to glimmer through the dolorous prison  "Com'un poco di raggio si fù messo  "Nel doloroso carcere  and I could again see those four countenances on which my own image was stamped I gnawed both my hands for grief My children supposing I did this through a desire to eat lifting themselves suddenly up exclaimed  O father our grief would be less if you would eat us  "Ambo le mani per dolor mi morsi  "E quei pensando ch'io'l fessi per voglia  "Di manicar di subito levorsi  "Et disser  Padre assai ci fia men doglia  "Se tu mangi di noi  "I restrained myself that I might not make them more miserable We were all silent that day and the following Ah cruel earth why didst thou not swallow us up at once  "Quel di et l'altro stemmo tutta muti  "Ahi dura terra perche non l'apristi  The fourth day being come Gaddo falling all along at my feet cried out  My father why do not you help me  and died  The other three expired one after the other between the fifth and sixth days famished as you see me now And I being seized with blindness began to crawl over them  sovra ciascuno  on hands and feet and for three days after they were dead continued calling them by their names At length famine finished my torments"  Having said this the poet adds with distorted eyes he again fixed his teeth on the mangled scull  Ibid See supr vol i And ESSAY ON POPE p  It is not improbable that the shades of unfortunate men who described under peculiar situations and with their proper attributes are introduced relating at large their histories in hell to Dante might have given the hint to Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM On the Misfortunes of Illustrious Personages the original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES  Dante's PURGATORY is not on the whole less fantastic than his HELL As his hell was a vast perpendicular cavity in the earth he supposes Purgatory to be a cylindric mass elevated to a prodigious height At intervals are recesses projecting from the outside of the cylinder In these recesses some higher and some lower the wicked expiate their crimes according to the proportion of their guilt From one department they pass to another by steps of stone exceedingly steep On the top of the whole or the summit of Purgatory is a platform adorned with trees and vegetables of every kind This is the Terrestrial Paradise which has been transported hither we know not how and which forms an avenue to the Paradise Celestial It is extraordinary that some of the Gothic painters should not have given us this subject  Dante describes not disagreeably the first region which he traverses on leaving Hell The heavens are tinged with sapphire and the star of love or the sun makes all the orient laugh He sees a venerable sage approach This is Cato of Utica who astonished to see a living man in the mansion of ghosts questions Dante and Virgil about the business which brought them hither  y  PURGAT CANT i  Virgil answers and Cato advises Virgil to wash Dante's face which was soiled with the smoak of hell and to cover his head with one of the reeds which grew on the borders of the neighbouring river Virgil takes his advice and having gathered one reed sees another spring up in its place This is the golden bough of the Eneid  uno avulso non deficit alter  The shades also as in Virgil croud to be ferried over Styx but an angel performs the office of Charon admitting some into the boat and rejecting others This confusion of fable and religion destroys the graces of the one and the majesty of the other  Through adventures and scenes more strange and wild than any in the Pilgrim's Progress we at length arrive at the twentyfirst Canto A concussion of the earth announces the deliverance of a soul from Purgatory This is the soul of Statius the favorite poet of the dark ages Although a very improper companion for Virgil he immediately joins our adventurers and accompanies them in their progress It is difficult to discover what pagan or christian idea regulates Dante's dispensation of rewards and punishments Statius passes from Purgatory to Paradise Cato remains in the place of expiation and Virgil is condemned to eternal torments  Dante meets his old acquaintance Forese a debauchee of Florence On finishing the conversation Forese asks Dante when he shall have the pleasure of seeing him again This question in Purgatory is diverting enough Dante answers with much serious gravity  "I know not the time of death but it cannot be too near Look back on the troubles in which my country is involved  CANT xxiv  "  The dispute between the pontificate and the empire appears to have been the predominant topic of Dante's mind This circumstance has filled Dante's poem with strokes of satire Every reader of Voltaire must remember that lively writer's paraphrase from the INFERNO of the story of count Guido in which are these inimitable lines A Franciscan friar abandoned to Beelzebub thus exclaims  "Monsieur de Lucifer  "Je suis un Saint voyes ma robe grise  "Je fus absous par le Chef de l'Eglise  "J'aurai toujours repondit le Demon  "Un grand respect pour l'Absolution  "On est lavè de ses vielles sotises  "Pourvu qu'après autres ne soient commises  "J'ai fait souvent cette distinction  "A tes pareils et grâce a l'Italie  "Le Diable sait la Theologie  "Il dit et rit Je ne repliquai rien  "A Belzebut il raisonnoit trop bien  "Lors il m'empoigne et d'un bras roide et ferme  "Il appliqua sur ma triste épiderme  "Vingt coups de fouet dont bien fort il me cuit  "Que Dieu le rend à Boniface huit"  Dante thus translated would have had many more readers than at present I take this opportunity of remarking that our author's perpetual reference to recent facts and characters is in imitation of Virgil yet with this very material difference The persons recognised in Virgil's sixth book for instance the chiefs of the Trojan war are the cotemporaries of the hero not of the poet The truth is Dante's poem is a satirical history of his own times  Dante sees some of the ghosts of Purgatory advancing forward more meagre and emaciated than the rest He asks how this could happen in a place where all live alike without nourishment Virgil quotes the example of Meleager who wasted with a firebrand on the gradual extinction of which his life depended He also produces the comparison of a mirror reflecting a figure These obscure explications do not satisfy the doubts of Dante Statius for his better instruction explains how a child grows in the womb of the mother how it is enlarged and by degrees receives life and intellect The drift of our  author is apparent in these profound illustrations He means to shew his skill in a sort of metaphysical anatomy We see something of this in the TESORETTO of Brunetto Unintelligible solutions of a similar sort drawn from a frivolous and mysterious philosophy mark the writers of Dante's age  The PARADISE of Dante the third part of this poem resembles his PURGATORY Its fictions and its allegories which suffer by being explained are all conceived in the same chimerical spirit The poet successively views the glory of the saints of angels of the holy Virgin and at last of God himself  Heaven as well as hell among the monks had its legendary description which it was heresy to disbelieve and which was formed on perversions or misinterpretations of scripture Our author's vision ends with the deity and we know not by what miraculous assistance he returns to earth  It must be allowed that the scenes of Virgil's sixth book have many fine strokes of the terrible But Dante's colouring is of a more gloomy temperature There is a sombrous cast in his imagination and he has given new shades of horror to the classical hell We may say of Dante that  Hell  Grows DARKER at his FROWN  PAR L ii    The sensations of fear impressed by the Roman poet are less harrassing to the repose of the mind they have a more equable and placid effect The terror of Virgil's tremendous objects is diminished by correctness of composition and elegance of style We are reconciled to his Gorgons and Hydras by the grace of expression and the charms of versification  In the mean time it may seem a matter of surprise that the Italian poets of the thirteenth century who restored admired and studied the classics did not imitate their beauties But while they possessed the genuine models of antiquity their  unnatural and eccentric habits of mind and manners their attachments to system their scholastic theology superstition ideal love and above all their chivalry had corrupted every true principle of life and literature and consequently prevented the progress of taste and propriety They could not conform to the practices and notions of their own age and to the ideas of the antients at the same time They were dazzled with the imageries of Virgil and Homer which they could not always understand or apply or which they saw through the mist of prejudice and misconception Their genius having once taken a false direction when recalled to copy a just pattern produced only constraint and affectation a distorted and unpleasing resemblance The early Italian poets disfigured instead of adorning thei  works by attempting to imitate the classics The charms which we so much admire in Dante do not belong to the Greeks and Romans They are derived from another origin and must be traced back to a different stock Nor is it at the same time less surprising that the later Italian poets in more enlightened times should have paid so respectful a compliment to Dante as to acknowledge no other model and with his excellencies to transcribe and perpetuate all his extravagancies  SECT XXXII  I NOW return to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES and to Sackville's Legend of Buckingham which follows his INDUCTION  The Complaynt of  HENRYE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM is written with a force and even elegance of expression a copiousness of phraseology and an exactness of versification not to be found in any other parts of the collection On the whole it may be thought tedious and languid But that objection unavoidably results from the general plan of these pieces It is impossible that soliloquies of such prolixity and designed to include much historical and even biographical matter should every where sustain a proper degree of spirit pathos and interest In the exordium are these nervous and correct couplets  Whom flattering Fortune falsely so beguilde  That loe she slew where earst ful smooth she smilde  Again  And paynt it forth that all estates may knowe  Have they the warning and be mine the woe  Buckingham is made to enter thus rapidly yet with much address into his fatal share of the civil broils between York and Lancaster  But what may boot to stay the sisters three  When Atropos perforce will cut the thred  The dolefull day was come when you might see  Northampton field with armed men orespred  In these lines there is great energy  O would to God the cruell dismall day  That gave me light fyrst to behold thy face  With foule eclipse had reft my sight away  The unhappie hower the time and eke the day c  And the following are an example of the simple and sublime united  And thou Alecto feede me with thy foode  Let fall thy serpents from thy snaky heare  For such reliefe well fits me in my moode  To feed my plaint with horroure and with feare  With rage afresh thy renomd worme areare  Many comparisons are introduced by the distressed speaker But it is common for the best poets to forget that they are describing what is only related or spoken The captive Proteus has his simile of the nightingale and Eneas decorates his narrative of the disastrous conflagration of Troy with a variety of the most laboured comparisons  Buckingham in his reproaches against the traiterous behaviour of his antient friend Banastre utters this forcible exclamation which breathes the genuine spirit of revenge and is unloaded with poetical superfluities  Hat  d be thou disdainde of everie wight  And pointed at whereever thou shalt goe  A traiterous wr  tch unworthy of the light  Be thou esteemde and to encrease thy woe  The sound be hatefull of thy name alsoe  And in this sort with shame and sharpe reproch  Leade thou thy life till greater grief approch  The ingenious writers of these times are perpetually deserting propriety for the sake of learned allusions Buckingham exhorts the peers and princes to remember the fate of some of the most  renowned heroes of antiquity whose lives and misfortunes he relates at large and often in the most glowing colours of poetry Alexander's murther of Clitus is thus described in stanzas pronounced by the poet and not by Buckingham  And deeply grave within your stonie hart  The dreerie dole that mightie Macedo  With teares unfolded wrapt in deadlie smarts  When he the death of Clitus sorrowed so  Whom erst he murdred with the deadlie blow  Raught in his rage upon his friend so deare  For which behold loe how his panges appeare  The launced speare he writhes out of the wound  From which the purple blood spins in his face  His heinous guilt when he returned found  He throwes himself uppon the corps alas  And in his armes howe oft doth he imbrace  His murdred friend And kissing him in vaine  Forth flowe the floudes of salt repentant raine  His friendes amazde at such a murther done  In fearfull flockes begin to shrinke away  And he thereat with heapes of grief fordone  Hateth  imselfe wishing his latter day  He calls for death and loathing longer life  Bent to his bane ref  seth kindlie foode  And plungde in depth of death and dolours strife  Had queld  Killed Manqueller is murderer  himselfe had not his friendes withstoode  Loe he that thus has shed the guiltlesse bloode  Though he were king and keper over all  Yet chose he death to guerdon death withall  This prince whos  peere  as never under sunne  Whose glistening  ame the earth did overglide  Which with his power the worlde welnigh had wonne  His bloudy handes himsel  e could no  abide  But folly bent with famine to have dide  The worthie prince deemed in his regard  That death for death could be but just reward  Our MIRROUR having had three new editions in  This edition printed by Thomas Marshe has clx leaves with a table of contents at the end    and  This edition printed also for T Marshe is improperly enough entitled  "The Last Parte of the MIRROUR FOR MAGISTRATES c"  But it contains all that is in the foregoing editions and ends with JANE SHORE or SHORE'S WIFE It has leaves In the title page the work is said to be  "Newly corrected and amended"  They are all in quarto and in black letter  was reprinted in quarto in the year  But in the Preface Higgins says h  began to prepare it twelve years before In imitation of the title a storybook was published called the MIRR  UR OF MIRTH by R D bl lett to Also The MIRROUR OF THE MATHEMATIKES A MIRROUR OF MONST  RS c  with the addition of many new lives under the conduct of John Higgins  Higgins lived at Winsham in Somersetshire  DEDICATION ut in  r  He was educated at Oxford was a clergyman and engaged in the instruction of youth As a preceptor of boys on the plan of a former collection by Nicholas Udal a celebrated master of Eton school he compiled the FLOSCULI OF TERENCE a manual famous in its time and applauded in a Latin epigram by the elegant Latin encomiast Thomas Newton of Cheshire  In  TERENT  FLOSCULOS  N Udalli et J Higgini opera decerptos  ENCOM fol It also pre  ixed to the book with others  In the pedagogic character he also published  "HOLCOT'S DICTIONARIE newlie corrected amended set in order and enlarged with many names of men townes beastes fowles etc By which you may finde the Latine or Frenche of anie Englishe worde you will By John Higgins late student in Oxeforde  Perhaps at Trinity college where one of both his names occurs in  "  In an engraved titlepage are a few English verses It is in folio and printed for Thomas Marshe at London The dedication to sir George Peckham knight is written by Higgins and is a  good specimen of his classical accomplishments He calls Peckham his  principal friend and the most eminent patron of letters A recommendatory copy of verses by Churchyard the poet is prefixed with four Latin epigrams by others Another of his works in the same profession is the NOMENCLATOR of Adrian Junius translated into English in conjunction with Abraham Flemming and printed at London for Newberie and Durham in  Octavo  It is dedicated in Latin to his most bountiful patron Doctor Valentine master of Requests and dean of Wells from Winsham  The D  dication of his MIRROUR TO MAGISTRATES is from the same place  From this dedication Higgins seems to have been connected with the school of Ilminster a neighbouring town in Somersetshire  He says that he translated it in London  "Quo facto novus interpres Waldenus Ilm  st  iae gymnasiarcha moriens priusquam manum  peri summam admovisset me ami  um veter  m suum omnib  s libri  suis et hoc imprimis Nom  nclatore his translation donavit"  But Higgins  ound his own v  rsion better which he therefore published yet with a part of his friend's  He appears to have been living so late as the year For in that year he published an Answer to William Perkins a forgotten controversialist concerning Christ's descent into hell dedicated from Winsham  To the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES Higgins wrote a new INDUCTION in the octave stanza and without assistance of friends began a new series from Albanact the youngest son of Brutus and the first king of Albanie or Scotland continued to the emperor Caracalla  At  ol  The two l  st lives in the latt  r  or what may be call  d B  ldwin's part of this edition are JANE SHORE and CARDINAL WOLSEY by

edition by Higgins among the pieces after the conquest first appeared the Life of CARDINAL WOLSEY by Churchyard  Fol b  of SIR NICHOLAS BURDET by Baldwine  Fol a  and of ELEANOR COBHAM  Fol b  and of

Subscribed THOMAS NEWTONUS  C  ystr  shyrius    who understood much more of Latin than of English poetry  The most poetical passage of Higgins's performance in this collection is in his Legend of QUEENE CORDILA or Cordelia king Lear's youngest daughter  Fol    Being imprisoned in a dungeon and  coucht on strawe  she sees amid the darkness of the night a  griesly ghost  approach  Eke nearer still with stealing steps shee drewe  Shee was of colour pale and deadly hewe  Her garment was figured with various sorts of imprisonment and pictures of violent and premature death  Her clothes resembled thousand kindes of thrall  And pictures plaine of  hastened deathes  withall  Cordelia in extreme terror asks  What wight art thou a foe or  fawning  rend  If Death thou art I pray thee  ake an end  But th' art not DeathArt thou some Fury sent  My woefull corps with paynes more to torment  With that she spake "I am thy frend DESPAYRE  * * * * * * * * * *  "Now if thou art to dye no whit afrayde  "Here shalt thou choose of Instruments beholde  "Shall rid thy restlesse life"  DESPAIR then throwing her robe aside shews Cordelia a thousand instruments of death knives sharpe swordes and ponyards  all bedyde with bloode and poysons  She presents the sword wit  which queen Dido slew herself  "Lo here the blade that D  do' of Carthage hight c  Cordelia takes this sword  but doubtfull yet to dye  DESPAIR then represents to her the state and power which she enjoyed in France her troops of attendants and the pleasures of the court she had left She then points out her present melancholy condition and dreary situation  She shewde me all the dongeon where I sate  The dankish walles the darkes and bade me smell  And byde the  avour if I like it well  Cordelia gropes f  r the sword or  fatall knife  in the dark which DESPAIR places in her hand  DESPAYRE to ayde my senceless limmes was glad  And gave the blade to end my woes she bad  At length Cordelia's s  ght fails her so that she can see only DESPAIR who exhorts her to strike  And by her elbowe DEATH for me did watch  DESPAIR at last gives the blow The temptation of the R  dcrosse knight by DESPAIR in Spenser'  FAERIE QUEENE seems to have been copied yet with high improvements from this scene These stanzas of Spenser bear a strong res  mblance to what I have cited from CORDELIA'S Legend  Then gan the villaine  That i  D  SPAIR  him to oueraw  And brought unto him swords rope  poysons fire  And all that might him to perdition draw  And bade him chuse what death he would desire  For death was due  o him that had prouokt God's ire  But when as none of them he sawe him take  He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene  And gaue it him in hand his hand did quake  And tremble like a lease of aspin greene  And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene  To come and goe with tydinges from the hart  As it a running messenger had beene  At last resolv'd to worke his finall smart  He lifted up his hand that backe againe did start  FAER QU  i x    The three first books of the FAERIE QUEENE were published in Higgins's Legend of Cordelia in  At length the whole was digested anew with additions in by Richard Niccols an ingenious poet of whom more will be said hereafter under the following title  "  A MIRROUR FOR MAGISTRATES  Of the early use in the middle ages of the word SP  CULUM as the title of a book see Joh Finnaeus's DISS  RTATIOHISTORICALITT  RARIA prefixed to the KONGSSKUGGSIO or ROYAL MIRROUR an antient prose work in Norvegian written about printed in to fol xviii  being a true Chronicleh  story of the untimely falles of such unfortunate princes and men of note as have happened since the first entrance of Brute into this Iland untill this our age  NEWLY ENLARGED with a  last part  called a WINTER NIGHT'S VISION being  an addition of such Tragedies especially famous as are exempted in the former Historie with a poem annexed called  ENGLANDS ELIZA At London imprinted by Felix Kyngston  A thick quarto  "  Niccols arranged his edition thus Higgins's INDUCTION is at the head of the Lives from Brutus to the Conquest Those from the conquest to LORD CROMWELL'S lege  d written by Drayton and now  first added  Drayton wrote three other legends on this plan Robert duke of Normandy Matilda and Pierce Gaveston of which I shall  pe  more particularly under that writer  are introduced by Sackville's INDUCTION After this are placed such lives as had been before omitted ten in number written by Niccols himself with an INDUCTION  Fol  As it illustrates the history of this work especially of Sackville's share in it I will here insert a part of Niccols's preface prefixed to those TRAGEDIES which happened after the conquest beginning with that of Robert Tresili  n  "Hauing hitherto continued the storie from the first entrance of BRVTE into this iland with the FALLES of svch PRINCES as were neuer before this time in one volume comprised I now proceed with the rest which take their beginning from the Co  quest whose penmen being many and diuerse all diuerslie affected in the method of this their MIRROUR I purpose onlie to follow the intended scope of that most honorable personage who by how mvch he did surpasse the rest in the eminence of  s noble condition by so mvch he hath exceeded them all in the excellencie of his heroicall stile which with golden pen he hath limmed out to posteritie in that worthie object of his minde the TRAGEDIE OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and in his Preface then intit  led MASTER SACK  ILS INDUCTION This worthy president of learning intended to perfect all this storie of himselfe from the Conquest Being called to a more serious expence of his time in the great state affaires of his most royall ladie and soueraigne he left the dispose therof to M Baldwine M Ferrers and others the compose  s of these Tragedies who continving their methode which was by way of dialogue or interlocvtion betwixt euerie Tragedie gaue it onlie place before the dvke of Bvckingham's COMPLAINT Which order I since hauing altered haue placed the INDUCTION in the beginninge with euerie Tragedie following according to svccession and ivst compvtation of time which before was not obserued  Fol Compare Baldwyne's Prologue at fol cxiv b  dit ut supr  "  In the Legend of king Richard the Thir  Niccols appears to have copied some passages from Shakespeare's Tragedy on that history In the opening of the play Richard says  Now are our brows bound with victorious w  eaths  Our bruised arms hung up for monuments  Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings  Our dreadfull marches to delightfull measures  Grimvisag'd War hath smooth'd his wrinkled front  And now instead of mounting barbed steeds  To fright the souls of fearfull adversaries  He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber  To the lascivious pleasing of a lute  Act i Sc i    These lines evidently gave rise to part of Richard's soliloquy in Niccols's Legend  The battels fought in field before  Were turn'd to meetings of sweet amitie  The wargod's thundring cannons dreadfull rore  And rattling drumsounds warlike harmonie  To sweettun'd noise of pleasing min  trals  e  God Mars laid by his Launce and tooke his Lute  And turn'd his rugged frownes to smiling lookes  In stead of crimson fields warres fatall fruit  He bathed his limbes in Cypre's warbling brookes  And set his thoughts upon her wanton lookes  Pag    Part of the tentscene in Shakespeare is also imitated by Niccols Richard starting from his horrid dream says  Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd  Came to my tent and every one did threat  To morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard  Act v Sc ult Drayton has also described these visionary terrors of Richard POLYOL  S xxii  When to the guilty king the black  orerunning night  Appear the dreadful ghosts of Henry and his Son  Of his owne brother George and his two nephewes done  Most cruelly to death and of his Wife and friend  Lord Hastinges with pale hands prepared as they would rend  Him peacemeal at which o  t he roar  t  in his sleep  The POLYOL  ION was published in fol    So Niccols  I thought that all those murthered ghosts whom I  By death had sent to their vntimely graue  With balefull noise about my tent did crie  And of the heauens with sad complaint did craue  That they on guiltie wretch might vengeance haue  To whom I thought the i  dge of heauen gaue eare  And gainst me gaue a iudgement full of feare  Pag    But some of the stanzas immediately following which are formed on Shakespeare's ideas yet with some original imagination will give the reader the most favourable idea of Niccols as a contributor to this work  For loe eftsoones a thousand hellish hags  Leauing th' abode of their infernall cell  Seasing on me my hatefull body drags  From forth my bed into a place like hell  Where fiends did naught but bellow howle and yell  Who in sterne strife stood gainst each other bent  Who should my hatefull bodie most torment  Tormented in such trance long did I lie  Till extreme feare did rouze me where I lay  And caus'd me from my naked bed to flie  Alone within my tente I durst not stay  This dreadfull dreame my soule did so affray  When wakt I was from sleepe I for a space  Thought I had beene in some infernall place  About mine eares a buzzing feare still flew  My fainting knees languish for want of might  Vpon my bodie stands an icie dew  My heart is dead within and with affright  The haire vpon my head doth stand vpright  Each limbe abovt me quaking doth resemble  A riuers rush that with the wind doth tremble  Thus with my guiltie soules sad torture torne  The darke nights dismall houres I past away  But at cockes crowe the message of the morne  My feare I did conceale c  Pag    If internal evidence was not a proof we are sure from other evidences that Shakespeare's tragedy preceded Niccols's legend The tragedy was written about Niccols at eighteen years of age was admitted into Magdalene college in Oxford in the year  Registr Univ Oxon He retired to Magdalene Hall where he was graduated in Arts Ibid  It is easy to point out other marks of imitation Shakespeare has taken nothing from Seagars's Richard the third printed in Baldwine's collection or first edition in the year Shakespeare however probably catched the idea of the royal shades in the same scene of th  tragedy before us appearing in succession and speaking to Richard and  Richmond from the general plan of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES more especially as many of Shakespeare's ghosts there introduced for instance King Henry the sixth Clarence Rivers Hastings and Buckingham are the personages of five of the legends belonging to this poem  SECT XXXIII  BY way of recapitulating what has been said and in order to give a connected and uniform view of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES in its most complete and extended state its original contents and additions I will here detail the subjects of this poem as they stand in this last or Niccols's edition of with reference to two preceding editions and some other incidental particularities  Niccols's edition after the Epistle Dedicatorie prefixed to

MAGISTRATES in a high rank It is under that head of his HYPERCRITICA entitled  "Prime Gardens for gathering English according to the true gage or standard of the tongue about fifteen or sixteen years ago"  The extract is a curious piece of criticism as written by a judicious cotemporary Having mentioned our prose writers the chief of which are More Sidney queen Elisabeth Hooker Saville cardinal Alan Bacon and Raleigh he proceeds thus  "In verse there are Edmund Spenser's HYMNES  The pieces mentioned in this extract will be considered in their proper places  I cannot advise the allowance of other his poems as for practick English no more than I can Jeffrey Chaucer Lydgate Pierce Plowman or LAUREATE Skelton It was laid as a fault to the charge of Salust that he used some old outworn words stoln out of Cato in his books de Originibus And for an historian in our tongue to affect the like out of those our poets would be accounted a foul oversightMy judgement is nothing at all in poems or poesie and therefore I dare not go far but will simply deliver my mind concerning those authors among us whose English hath in my conceit most propriety and is nearest to the phrase of court and to the speech used among the noble and among the better sort in London the two sovereign seats and as it were parliament tribunals to try the question in Brave language are Chapman's IliadsThe works of Samuel Daniel containe somewhat  aflat but yet withal a very pure and copious English  and words as warrantable as any mans and fitter perhaps for prose than measure Michael Drayton's Heroical Epistles are well worth the reading also for the purpose of our subject which is to furnish an English historian with choice and copy of tongue Queen Elizabeth's verses those which I have seen and read some exstant in the elegant witty and artificial book of the ART OF ENGLISH POETRIE the work as the fame is of one of her gentlemenpensioners Puttenham are princely as her prose Never must be forgotten St PETER'S COMPLAINT and those other serious poems said to be father Southwell's the English whereof as it is most proper so the sharpness and light of wit is very rare in them Noble Henry Constable was a great master in English tongue nor had any gentleman of our nation a more pure quick or higher delivery of conceit witness among all other that Sonnet of his before his Majesty's LEPANTO I have not seen much of sir Edward Dyer's poetry Among the lesser late poets George Gascoigne's Works may be endured But the best of these times if Albion's England be not preferred for our business is the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES and in that MIRROUR  Sackvil's INDUCTION the work of Thomas afterward earl of Dorset and lord treasurer of England whose also the famous Tragedy of GORDOBUC was the best of that time even in sir Philip Sidney's judgement and all skillful Englishmen cannot but ascribe as much thereto for his phrase and eloquence therein But before in age if not also in noble courtly and lustrous English is that of the Songes and Sonnettes of Henry Howard earl of Surrey son of that victorious prince the duke of Norfolk and father of that learned Howard his most lively image Henry earl of Northampton written chiefly by him and by sir Thomas Wiat not the dangerous commotioner but his worthy father Nevertheless they who commend those poems and exercises of honourable wit if they have  seen that incomparable earl of Surrey his English translation of Virgil's Eneids which for a book or two he admirably rendreth almost line for line will bear me witness that those other were foils and sportives The English poems of sir Walter Raleigh of John Donne of Hugh Holland but especially of sir Foulk Grevile in his matchless MUSTAPHA are not easily to be mended I dare not presume to speak of his Majesty's exercises in this heroick kind Because I see them all left out in that which Montague lord bishop of Winchester hath given us of his royal writings But if I should declare mine own rudeness rudely I should then confess that I never tasted English more to my liking nor more smart and put to the height of use in poetry than in that vital judicious and most

most eminent poets thr  ughout the reign of queen Elisabeth and afterwards was published about forty years ago by Mr Thomas Hayward of Hungerford in Berkshire viz  "The BRITISH MUSE A Collection of

William Oldys with the supervisal and corrections of his friend doctor Cam  bell This aneodote I learn from a manuscript i  sertion by Oldy  in my copy of Allot'  ENGLANDS PARNASSUS abovementioned which once belonged to Oldys  At the latter end of the reign of queen Elisabeth as I am informed from some curious manuscript authorities a thin quarto in the black letter was published with this title  "The MIRROUR OF MIRROVRS or all the tragedys of the Mirrovr for Magistrates abbreuiated in breefe histories in prose Very necessary for those that haue not the Cronicle London imprinted for

illustrate this favorite series of historic soliloquies or a plan to present its subjects which were now become universally popular in rhyme in the dress of prose  It is reasonable to suppose that the publication of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES enriched the stores and extended the limits of our drama These lives are so many tragical speeches in character We have seen that they suggested scenes to Shakespeare Some critics imagine that HISTORICAL Plays owed their origin to this collection At least it is certain that the writers of this MIRROUR were the first who made a poetical use of the English chronicles recently compiled by Fabyan Hall and Hollinshed which opened a new field of subjects and events and I may add produced a great revolution in the state of popular knowledge For before those elaborate and voluminous compilations appeared the History of England which had been shut up in the Latin narratives of the monkish annalists was unfamiliar and almost unknown to the general reader  SECT XXXIV  IN tracing the gradual accessions of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES an incidental departure from the general line of our chronologic series has been incurred But such an anticipation was unavoidable in order to exhibit a full and uninter  upted view of that poem which originated in the reign of Mary and was not finally completed till the beginning of the seventeenth century I now therefore return to the reign of queen Mary  To this reign I assign Richard Edwards a native of Somersetshire about the year He is said by Wood to have been a scholar of Corpus Christi college in Oxford but in his early years he was employed in some department about the court This circumstance appears from one of his poems in the PARADISE OF DAINTIE DEVISES a miscellany which contains many of his pieces  In youthfull yeares when first my young desires began  To pricke me forth to serve in court a slender tall young man  My fathers b  essing then I asked upon my knee  Who

some of the beauties of the courts of queen Mary and of queen Elisabeth  MSS COTTON Tit A xxiv  "To some court Ladies"  Pr  "Howarde is not hawghte c"  Hence we may conjecture that he did not long remain at the university About this time he was probably a member of Lincoln'sinn In the year he was constituted a gentleman of the royal chapel by queen Elisabeth and master of the singing boys there He had received his musical education while at Oxford under George Etheridge  George Etheridge born at Thame in Oxfordshire was admitted Scholar of Corpus Christi college Oxford under the tuition of the learned John Shepreve in Fellow in In he was made royal professor of Greek at Oxford In he was recommended by lord Williams of Thame to Sir Thomas Pope founder of Trinity college in Oxford to be admitted a fellow of his college at its first foundation But Etheridge chusing to pursue the medical line that scheme did not take effect He was persecuted for popery by queen Elisabeth at her accession but afterwards practised physic at Oxford with much reputation and established a private seminary there for the instruction of catholic youths in the classi  s music and logic Notwithstanding his active perseverance in the papistic persuasion he presented to the queen when she visited Oxford in  an E  comium in Gre  k verse on her father Henry now in the British Museum MSS

Ferrers as most eminent in tragedy gives the prize to Edwards for Comedy and Interlude  ARTE OF ENGLISH POETRY fol  The word Interlude is here of wide extent For Edwards besides that he was a writer of regular dramas appears to have been a contriver of masques and a composer of poetry for pageants In a word he united all those arts and accomplishments which minister to popular pleasantry he was the first fiddle the most fashionable sonnetteer the readiest rhymer and the most facetious mimic of the court In consequence of his love and his knowledge of the histrionic art he taught the choristers over which he presided to act plays and they were formed into a company of players like those of saint Paul's cathedral by the queen's licence under the superintendency of Edwards  See supr

which no specimens could be transmitted to posterity and which prejudiced his partial cotemporaries in favour of his poetry He died in the year  Wood ATH OXON i See also ibid FA  T    In the  Epitaphs Songs and Sonets  of George Turbervile printed in there are two elegies on his death which record the places of his education ascertain his poetical and musical character and bear ample testimony to the high distinction in which his performances more particularly of the dramatic kind were held The fist is by Turbervile himself entitled  "An Epitaph on Maister Edwards sometime Maister of the

Colwell in beginning  "I am not the fyrst that hath taken in hande The wearynge of the willow  garlande"  This song often reprinted  seems to have been written in consequence of that sung by Desdemona

English verse educated a few years after Edwards at Corpus Christi college and an actor in Edwards's play of PALAMON AND ARCITE before queen Elisabeth at Oxford in  Miles Winsore of the same college was another actor in that play and I suppose his performance was much liked by the queen For when her maj  sty left Oxford after this visit he was appointed by the university to speak an or  tion

perhaps the earliest notice now to be found in print of this young company of comedians at least the earliest proof of their celebrity From the same pamphlet we learn that it gave still greater offence to the puritans that they were suffered to act plays on profane subjects in the royal chapel its  lf  "Even in her maiesties chappel do these pretty vpstart youthes profane the Lordes Day by the lascivious writhing of their tender limbs and gorgeous decking of their apparell in feigning bawdie fables gathered from the idolatrous heathen poe  s c"  ibid fol xiii b But this practice soon

Admonition to the Balladsingers of London from Antonie Now Now or Antony Munday just mentioned in the text a great Balladwriter From this piece it appears that the antient and respectable profession

Oxford and maister Edwardes of her majesties chappel for comedy and enterlude  Lib i ch xxxi fol a  "  Among the books of my friend the late Mr William Collins  of Chichester now dispersed was a Collection of short comic stories in prose printed in the black letter under the year  "sett forth by maister Richard Edwardes mayster of her maiesties reuels"  Undoubtedly this is the same Edwards who from this title expressly appears to have been the general conductor of the court festivities and who most probably succeeded in this office George Ferrers one of the original authors of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES  Who had certainly q  itted that office before the year For in George Gascoigne's Narrative of queen Elisabeth's splendid visit at Kenilworthcastle in Warwickshire entitled the PRINCELIE PLEASURES OF KENILWORTHCASTLE the octav  stanzas spoken by the Lady of the Lake are said to have been  "devised and penned by M Master Ferrers sometime Lord of Misrule in the Court"  Signat A iij See also Signat B ij This was GEORGE FERRERS mentioned in the text a contributor to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES I take this opportunity of insinuating my suspicions that I have too closely followed the testimony of Philips Wood and Tanner in supposing that this GEORGE Ferrers and EDWARD Ferrer  a writer of plays were two distinct persons See supr p I am now convinced that they have been confounded and that they are one and the same man We have already seen and from good authority that GEORGE Ferrers was Lord of Misrule to the cou  t that is among other things of a like kind a writer of court interludes or plays and that king Edward the sixth  had great delight in his pastimes  See supr vol ii The confusion appears to have originated from Puttenham the author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH PO  SIE who has inadvertently given to GEORGE the christian name of EDWARD But his account or character of this EDWARD Ferrers has served  o lead us to the truth  "But the principall man in this profession poetry at the same time of Edward the six  h was maister EDWARD Ferrys a man of no lesse mirth and felici  ie that way but of much more skil and magnificence in his meeter and therefore wrate for the most part to the stage in Tragedie and sometimes in Comedie or Enterlude wherein he gave the king so much good recreation as he had thereby many good rewardes"  Lib i ch xxxi pag edit And again  "For Tragedie the Lord Buckhurst and maister Edward Ferrys for such doinges as I have sene of theirs deserve the highest price"  Ibid p His Tragedies with the  magnificent meeter  are perhaps nothing more than the stately monologues in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES and he might have written others either for the stage in general or the more private entertaiment of the court now lost and probably never printed His Comedie and Enterlude are perhaps to be understood to have  een not so much regular and professed dramas for a theatre as little dramatic mumm  ries for the courtholidays or other occasional festivities The courtshows like this at Kenilworth were accompanied with personated dialogues in verse and the whole pageantry was often styled an interlude This reasoning also accounts for Puttenham's s  eming omission in not having enumerated the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES by name among the shining poems of his age I have before observed what is much to our purpose that no plays of an EDWARD Ferrers or Ferrys which i  the same in print or manuscript are now known to exist nor are mentioned by any writer of the times with which we are now concerned GEORGE Ferrers at least from what actually remains of him has some title to the dramatic character Our GEORGE Ferrers from the part he bore in the exhibitions at Kenilworth appears to have been employed as a writer of metrical speeches or dialogues to b  spoken in character long after he had left the office of lord of misrule A proof of hi  reputed  xcellence in composition  of this nature and of the celebrity with which he filled that department  I also take this opportunity the earliest which has occurred of retracting ano  her slight mistake See supr p There was a second edition of Niccols's MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES printed for W Aspley Lond to  Among these tales was that  of the INDUCTION OF THE TINKER in Shakespeare's TAMING OF THE SHREW and perhaps Edwards's storybook was the immediate source from which Shakespeare or rather the author of the old TAMING OF A SHREW drew that diverting apologue  See SIX OLD PLAYS Lond mo  If I recollect right the circumstances almost exactly tallied with an incident which Heuterus relates from an Epistle of Ludovicus Vives to have actually happened at the marriage of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy about the year I will give it in the words either of Vives or of that perspicuous annalist who flourished about the year  "Nocte quadam a caena cum aliquot praecipuis amicorum per urbem deambulans jacentem conspicatus est medio foro hominem de

irresistible digression into which the magic of Shakespeare's name has insensibly seduced us I hope to be pardo  d for adding another narrative of this frolic from the ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY by Democritus junior or  Burton a very learned and ingenious writer of the reign of king James the first  "When as by reason of unseasonable weather he could neither hawke nor hunt and was now tired with ca  ds and dice and such other domesticall sports or to see ladies dance with some of his courtiers he would in the evening walke disguised all about the towne It so fortuned as he was walking late one night he found a country fellow dead drunke snorting on a bulke hee caused his followers to bring him to his palace and then stripping him of his old clothes and attyring him in the courtfashion when he wakened he and they were all ready to attend upon his Excellency  and persuaded him he was some great Duke The poore fellow admiring how he came there was served in state all day long after supper he saw them dance heard musicke and all the rest of those courtlike pleasures But late at night when he was well tipled and againe faste asleepe they put on his old robes and so conveyed him to the place where they first found him Now the fellowe had not made there so good sport the day before as he did now when he returned to himselfe all the jest was to see how he looked upon it In conclusion after some little admiration the poore man told his friends he had seene a vision constantly believed it would not otherwise be persuaded and so the joke ended  Burton's ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY Part ii § pag fol Oxon There is an older edition in quarto  "  If this is a true story it is a curious specimen of the winterdiversions of a very polite court of France in the middle of the fifteenth century The merit of the contrivance however and comic effect of this practical joke will atone in some measure for many indelicate circumstances with which it must have necessarily been attended I presume it first appeared in Vives's Epistle I have seen the story of a tinker disguised like a lord in recent collections of humorous tales probably transmitted from Edwards's storybook which I wish I had examined more carefully  I have assigned Edwards to queen Mary's reign as his reputation in the character of general poetry seems to have been then at its height I have mentioned

proceed I must say a few words concerning the very remarkable practice implied in these stanzas of seizing boys by a warrant for the service of the king's chapel Strype has printed an abstract of an instrument by which it appears that emissaries were dispatched into various parts of England with full powers to take boys from any choir for the use of the chapel of king Edward the sixth Under the year says Strype there was a grant of a commission  "to Philip Van Wilder gentleman of the Privy Chamber in anie churches or chappells within England to take to the king's use such and as many  singing children and choristers as he or his deputy shall think good  Dat April Strype's MEM ECCL ii p  "  And again in the following year the master of the king's chapel that is the master of the

ed  "to find six singing children for the king's privy chamber"  Ibid I presume this appointment was transmitted from preceding reigns  "  Under the year there is a commission of the same sort from king Henry the sixth  De ministrallis propter solatium regis providendis  for procuring minstrels even by force for the solace or entertainment of the king and it is required that the minstrels so procured should be not only skilled  in arte minstrallatus  in the art of minstrelsy but  membris naturalibus elegantes  handsome and elegantly shaped  Rym  FOED xi  As the word Minstrel is of an extensive signification and is applied as a general term to every character of that species of men whose business it was to entertain either with oral recitation music gesticulation and singing or with a mixture of all these arts united it is certainly difficult to determine whether singers only more particularly singers for the royal chapel were here intended The last clause may perhaps more immediately seem to point out tumblers or posturemasters  Even so late as the present reign of qu  n Mary we find tumblers introduced for the diversion of the court In at a grand military review of the queen's pensioners in Greenwich park  "came a Tumbler and played many pretty seats the queen and cardinal Pole looking on whereat she was observed to laugh heartily c"  Strype's ECCL MEM iii p ch xxxix Mr Astle has a roll of some private expences of king Edward the second among which it appears that fifty shillings were paid to a person who danced before the king on a  able  "et lui  t  re  grandement ri  e"  And that twenty shillings were allowed to another who rode before his majesty and o  ten fell from his horse at which his majesty laughed heartily  de queux roi rya grantement  The laughter of kings was thought worthy to be recorded  But in the register of the capitulary acts of York cathedral it is ordered as an indispensable qualification that the chorister who is annually to be elected the boybishop should be  competenter corpore formosus  I will transcribe an article of the register relating to that ridiculous ceremony  "Dec Joannes  de Quixly confirmatur Episcopus

produced in Spayne entitled the second GRESIELD practised not long out of this time in much part tragedous as delectable both to hearers and readers"  This is a panegyrical history in octave rhyme of the life of queen Catharine the first queen of king Henry the eighth The poet compares Catharine to patient Grisild celebrated by Petrarch and Chaucer and Henry to earl Walter her husband  The

the symple and unlearned Syr Wylliam Forrest preeiste propria manu"  The poem which consists of twenty chapters contains a zealous condemnation of Henry's divorce and I believe preserves some anecdotes yet apparently misrepresented by the writer's religious and political bigotry not extant in any of our printed histories Forrest was a student at Oxford at the time when this notable and knotty point of casuistry prostituted the learning of all the universities of Europe to the gratification of the capricious amours of a libidinous and implacable tyrant He has recorded many particulars and local incidents of what passed in Oxford during that transaction  In the first chapter he thus speaks of the towardliness of the princess Catharine's younger years  With stoole and needyl she was not to seeke  And other practiseingis for ladyes meete  To pastyme at tables ticktacke or gleeke  Cardys dyce c  He adds that she was a pure virgin when married to the king and that her first husband prince Hen  y on account of his tender years never slept with her  At the end of the poem is a metrical ORATION CONSOLATORY in six leaves to queen Mary  In the British Museum is another

have acquired the character of a poet from a metrical translation of some of David's Psalms about the year Bale's narrow prejudices are well known The puritans never suspected that they were greater bigots than the papists I believe one or two of Shepherd's pieces in prose are among bishop Tanner's books at Oxford  Bale also mentions metrical English versions of ECCLESIASTES of the histories of

style began to be now regarded At the general restoration of knowledge and taste it was a great impediment to the progress of our language that all the learned and ingenious aiming at the character of erudition wrote in Latin English books were written only by the superficial and illiterate at a time when judgment and genius should have been exerted in the nice and critical task of polishing a rude speech Long after the invention of typography our vernacular style instead of being strengthened and refined by numerous compositions was only corrupted with new barbarisms and affectations for want of able and judicious writers in English Unless we except sir Thomas More whose DIALOGUE ON TRIBULATION and HISTORY OF RICHARD THE THIRD were esteemed standards of style so low as the reign of James the first Roger Ascham was perhaps the first of our scholars who ventured to break the shackles of Latinity by publishing his TOXOPHILUS in English chiefly with a view of giving a pure and correct model of English composition or rather of shewing how a subject might be treated with grace and propriety in En  lish as well as in Latin His own vindication of his conduct in attempting this great innovation is too sensible to be omitted and reflects light on the revolutions of our poetry  "As for the Lattine or Greeke tongue euerye thinge is so excellentlye done in Them that none can do better

The Schole or partition of shooting  Lond to    Ascham's example was followed by other learned men But the chief was Thomas Wilson who published a system of LOGIC and RHETORIC both in English Of his LOGIC I have already spoken I have at present only to speak of the latter which is not only written in English but with a view of giving rules for composing in the English language It appeared in the first year of queen Mary and is entitled THE ARTE OF RHETORIKE  for the vse of all suche as are studious of Eloquence sette forthe in Englishe by  THOMAS WILSON  Lond to Dedicated to John Dudley earl of Warwick In the Dedication he says that he wrote great part of this treatise during the last summer vacation in the country at the house of sir Edward Dimmoke And that it originated from a late conversation with his lordship  "emonge other talke of learnyng"  It was reprinted by Jhon Kynston in Lond to With  "A Prologue to the Reader"  dated Dec Again to And to In the PROLOGU  he mentions his escape at Rome which I have above related and adds  "If others neuer gette more by bookes than I have doen it wer better be a carter than a scholar for worldlie pro  ite"  Leonarde Cox a schoolmaster patronised by Farringdon the last abbot of Reading had published in as I have observed an English tract on rhetoric which is nothing more than a technical and elementary man  al Wilson's treatise is more liberal and discursive illustrating the arts of eloquence by example and examining and ascertaining the beauties of composition with the speculative skill and sagacity of a critic It may therefore be justly considered as the first book or system of criticism in our language A few extracts  from so curious a performance need no apology which will also serve to throw light on the present period and indeed on our general subject by displaying the state of critical knowledge and the ideas of writing which now prevailed  I must premise that Wilson one of the most accomplished scholars of his times was originally a fellow of King's College  Admitted scholar in A native of Lincolnshire MS Hatcher  where he was tutor to the two celebrated youths Henry and Charles Brandon dukes of Suffolk Being a doctor of laws he was afterwards one of the ordinary masters of requests master of saint Katharine's hospital near the Tower a frequent embassador from queen Elisabeth to Mary queen of Scots and into the Low countries a secretary of state and a privy counsellor and at length in dean of Durham He died in His remarkable diligence and dispatch in negotiation is said to have resulted from an uncommon strength of memory It is another proof of his attention to the advancement of our English style that he translated seven orations of Demosthenes which in he dedicated to sir William Cecill  Which had b  en also translated into Latin by Nicholas Carr To whose version Hatcher prefixed this distich MSS More Carr'  Autograph MS  Haec  adem patrio Thomas sermone polivit  Wilsonus patrii gloria prima soli  Wilson published many other things In Gabriel Harvey's SMITHUS dedicated to sir Walter Mildmay and printed by Binneman in he is ranked with his learned cotemporaries See SIGNAT D iijE ijI j    Under that chapter of his third book of RHETORIC which treats of the four parts belonging to elocution Plainnesse Aptnesse Composicio  Exornacion Wilson has these observations on simplicity of style which are immediately directed to those who write in the English tongue  "Among other lessons this should first be learned that we neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes but to speake as is commonly receiued neither seking to be ouer fine nor yet liuing ouer carelesse vsing our speache as moste men do and ordering our wittes as the fewest haue doen Some seke so farre for outlandishe Englishe that they forget altogether their mothers language And I dare  sweare this if some of their mothers were aliue thei were not able to tel what thei saie and yet these fine Englishe clerkes wil saie thei speake in their mother tongue if a man should charge them for counterfeityng the kinges Englishe Some farre iournied gentlemen at their returne home like as thei loue to go in forrein apparel so thei will pouder their talke with ouersea language He that cometh lately out of Fraunce will talke Frenche Englishe and neuer blushe at the matter Another choppes in with Englishe Italianated and applieth the Italian phraise to our Englishe speakyng the whiche is as if an Oration that professeth to vtter his mynde in plaine Latine would needes speake Poetrie and farre fetched colours of straunge antiquitie The lawier will store his stomacke with the prating of pedlers The auditour in makyng his accompt and reckenyng cometh in with  sise sould  and  cater denere  for vj s and iiij d The fine courtier will talke nothyng but CHAUCER The misticall wisemen and poeticall clerkes will speake nothyng but quainte prouerbes and blinde allegories delightyng muche in their owne darknesse especially when none can tel what thei do saie The vnlearned or folishe phantasticall that smelles but of learnyng svche fellowes as haue seene learned men in their daies will so Latine their tongues that the simple cannot but wonder at their talke and thinke surely thei speake by some reuelacion I know Them that thinke RHETORIKE to stande wholie vpon darke wordes and he that can catche an ynkehorne terme by the taile hym thei compt to be a fine Englishman and a good rhetorician  Puttenham in THE ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE where he treats of style and language brings some illustrations from the practice of oratory in the reign of queen Mary in whose court he lived and although his book is dated it was manisestly written much earlier He refers to sir Nicholas Bacon who began to be high in the departments of the law in queen Mary's time and died in Having told a story from his own knowledge in the year of a ridiculous oration made in parliament by a new speaker of the house who came from Yorkshire and had more knowledge in the affairs of his county and of the law than gracefulness or delicacy of language he proceeds  "And though graue and wise counsellours in their consultations do not vse much superstitious  loquence and also in their iudiciall hearings do much mislike all scholasticall rhetoricks yet in such a case as it may be and as this parliament was if the lord chancelour of England or archbishop of Canterbury himselfe were to speke he ought to do it cunningly and eloquently which cannot be without the vse of figures and neuerthelesse none impeachment or blemish to the grauitie of their persons or of the cause wherein I report me to them that knew sir Nicholas Bacon lord Keeper of the great seale or the now lord treasurer of England and haue bene conuersant in their speeches made in the parliament house and starre chamber From whose lippes I haue seene to proceede more graue and naturall eloquence than from all the oratours of Oxford and CambridgeI have come to the lord Keeper sir Nicholas Bacon and found him sitting in his gallery alone with the workes of Quintilian before him In deede he was a most eloquent man and of rare learning and wisdome as euer I knew England to breed and one that ioyed as much in learned men and men of good witts"  Lib iii ch ii pag seq What follows soon afterwards is equally apposite  "This part in our maker or poet must be heedyly looked vnto that it his  language be naturall pure and the most vsuall of all his countray and for the same purpose rather that which is spoken in the kinges court or in the good townes and cities within the land than in the marches or frontiers or in port townes where straungers haunt for traffike sake or yet in vniuersities where schollars vse much peevish affectation of words out of the primitiue languages or finally in any vplandish village or corner of the realme c But he shall follow generally the better brovght vp sort such as the Greekes call  chari  ntes  men ciuill and graciously behauored and bred Our maker thereso  e at these dayes shall not follow P  ERS PLOWMAN nor Gower nor Lydgate nor yet Chaucer for their language is now out of vse with vs neither shall he take the termes of northerne men suche as they vse in daily talke whether they be noblemen or gentlemen or of their best clarkes all is a matter c Ye shall therefore take the vsuall speach of the court and that of London and the shires lying abovt London within lx myles and not mvch aboue I say not this bvt that in euery shyre of England there be gentlemen and others that speke but specially write as good Sovtherne as we of Middlesex and Surrey do bvt not the common people of euery shire to whom the gentlemen and also their learned clarkes do for the most part condescend but herein we are ruled by the English Dictionaries and other bookes written by learned men Albeit peraduenture some small admonition be not impertinent for we finde in our English writers many wordes and speeches amendable and ye shall see in some many inkhorne termes so ill affected brought in by men of learning as preachers and schoolemasters and many straunge termes of other languages by secretaries and marchaunts and traueillours and many darke wordes and not vsuall nor well sounding though they be daily spoken at court"  Ibid Ch iii fol  And the rather to set out this folie  I will adde here svche a letter as William Sommer  King Henry's Jester In another place he gives us one of Somner's jests  "William Sommer seying muche adoe for accomptes makyng and that Henry the eight wanted money such as was due to him And please your grace q  oth he you haue so many Frauditours so many Conueighers and so many Deceiuers to get vp your money that thei get all to themselues"  That is Auditors Surveyors and Receivers fol b I have seen an old narrative of a progress of king Henry the eighth and queen Katharine to Newbery in Berkshire where Somner who had accompanied their majesties as courtbuffoon sell into disgrace with the people for his impertinence was detained and obliged to submit to many ridiculous indignities but extricated himself from all his dissiculties by comic expedients and the readiness of his wit On returning to court he gave their majesties who were inconsolable for his long absence a minute account of these low adventures with which they were infinitely entertained What shall we think of the manners of such a court  himself could not make a better for that purposedeuised by a Lincolne  hire  man for a voide benefice  Viz  "Ponderyng expendyng and reuolutyng with myself your ingent affabilitie and ingenious capacitie for mundane affaires I cannot but celebrate and extoll your magnificall dexteritie above all other For how could you have adapted suche illustrate prerogative and dominiall superioritie if the  ecunditie of your ingenie had not been so fertile and wonderfull pregnaunt c'  It is to the lord Chancellor See what is said of A Bordes's style supr p  "  This point he illustrates with other familiar and pleasant instances  B iii fol b edit    In enforcing the application and explaining the nature of fables for the purpose of amplification he gives a general idea of the Iliad and Odyssey  "The saying of poetes and al their fables are not to be forgotten For by them we maie talke at large and win men by perswasion if we declare before hand that these tales wer not fained of suche wisemen without cause neither yet continued vntill this time and kept in memorie without good consideracion and therevpon declare the true meanyng of all svche writynge For vndoubtedly there is no one Tale among all the poetes but vnder the same is comprehended somethyng that perteyneth either to the amendement of maners to the knowledge of truthe to the settyng forth natures worke or els to the vnderstanding of some notable thing doen For what other is the painful trauaile of Vlisses described so largely by Homere but a liuely picture of mans miserie in this life And as Plutarche saith and likewise Basilius Magnus in the ILIADES are described strength and valiauntnesse of bodie in ODISSEA is set forthe a liuely paterne of the mynde The Poetes are Wisemen and wisshed in harte the redresse of thinges the which when for feare thei durst not openly rebuke they did in colours paint them out and tolde men by shadowes what thei shold do in good sothe or els because the wicked were vnworthy to heare the trueth thei spake so  that none might vnderstande but those vnto whom thei please to vtter their meanyng and knewe them to be men of honest conuersacion  Lib iii fol b  "  Wilson thus recommends the force of circumstantial description or what he calls  An euident or plaine setting forthe of a thing as though it were presently doen  "An example If our enemies shal inuade and by treason win the victory we shal all die euery mothers sonne of vs and our citee shal be destroied sticke and stone I se our children made slaues our daughters rauished our wiues carried away the father forced to kill his owne sonne the mother her daughter the sonne his father the sucking childe slain in his mothers bosom one standyng to the knees in anothers blood churches spoiled houses plucte down and al set on fire round about vs euery one cvrsing the daie of their birth children criyng women wailing c Thus where I might haue said  We shal al be destroied  and say no more I haue by description set the euill forthe at large  Fol a  "  It must be owned that this picture of a sacked city is literally translated from Quintilian But it is a proof that we were now beginning to make the beauties of the antients our own  On the necessity of a due preservation of character he has the following precepts which seem to be directed to the writers of Historical Plays  "In describyng of persons there ought alwaies a comelinesse to be vsed so that nothing be spoken which may be thought is not in them As if one shold describe Henry the sixt He might call hym jentle milde of nature ledde by perswacion and ready to forgiue carelesse for wealth suspecting none mercifull to al fearful in aduersitie and without forecast to espie his misfortvne Againe for Richarde the thirde I might brynge him in cruell of harte ambicious by nature enuious of minde a deepe dissembler a close man for weightie matters hardie to reuenge and fearefull  to lose hys high estate trustie to none liberall for a purpose castyng still the worste and hoping euer for the best  Richard the third seems to have been an UNIVERSAL character for exemplifying a cruel disposition Our author meaning to furnish a chamber with persons famous for the greatest crimes says in another place  "In the bedstede I will set Richarde the third kinge of Englande or somelike notable murtherer"  fol b Shakespeare was not the first that exhibited this tyrant upon the stage In a ballad was printed called a  "tragick report of kinge Richarde the iii"  REGISTR STATION B fol b  By this figure  Lively Description  also we imagine a talke for some one to speake and accordyng to his persone we frame the oration As if one shoulde bryng in noble Henry the eight of famous memory to enuegh against rebelles thus he might order his oration  What if Henry the eight were aliue and sawe suche rebellion in the realme would he not saie thus and thus  Yea methinkes I heare hym speake euen nowe And so sette forthe suche wordes as we would haue hym to s  y  Fol b  "  Shakespeare himself has not delineated the characters of these English monarchs with more truth And the first writers of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES who  imagine a talke for some one to speake and according to his person frame the oration  appear to have availed themselves of these directions if not to have catched the notion of their whole plan from this remarkable passage  He next shews the advantages of personification in enlivening a composition  "Some times it is good to make God the Countray or some one Towne to speake and looke what we would saie in our owne persone to frame the whole tale to them Such varietie doeth much good to auoide tediousnesse For he that speaketh all in one sorte though he speake thinges neuer so wittilie shall sone weary his hearers Figures therefore were inuented to auoide satietie and cause delite to refresh with pleasure and quicken with grace the dulnesse of mans braine Who will looke on a white wall an houre together where no workemanshippe is at all Or who will eate still one kynde of meate and neuer desire chaunge  Fol b a  "  Prolix Narratives whether jocose or serious had not yet ceased to be the entertainment of polite companies and rules for telling a tale with grace now found a place in a book of general rhetoric  Yet he has here also a reference to the utility of tales both at the Bar and in the Pulpit For in another place professedly both speaking of Pleadings and Sermons he says  "If tyme maie so serue it were good when menne be wearied to make them somewhat merie and to begin with some pleasaunte tale or take occasion to ieste wittelie c"  fol b Again  "Men commonlie tarie the ende of a merie Plaie and cannot abide the half hearyng of a sower checkyng Sermon Therefore euen these aunciente preachers muste nowe and then plaie the fooles in the pulpite to serue the tickle eares of their fletyng audience c"  fol a I know not if he means Latimer here whom he commends  "There is no better preacher among them al except Hugh Latimer the father of al preachers"  fol a And again  "I would thinke it not amisse to speake muche accordyng to the nature and phansie of the ignorant that the rather thei might be wonne through fables to learne more weightie and graue matters For al men cannot brooke sage causes and auncient collations but will like earnest matters the rather if some be spoken there among agreeing to their natures The multitude as Horace doth saie is a beast or rather a monster that hath many hedde  and therefore like vnto the diuersitie of natvres varietie of inuention must alwaies be vsed Talke altogether of moste graue matters or deppely searc  e out the ground of thynges or vse the quiddities of Duns Scotus to set forth Gods misteries you shal se the ignorant I warrant you either fall aslepe or els bid you farewell The multitude must nedes be made merry and the more foolish your talke is the more wise will thei compt it to be And yet it is no foolishnes but rather wisdome to win men by telling of fables to heare Gods goodnes"  fol a See also fol a a Much to the same purpose he says  "Euen in this our tyme some offende muche in tediousnesse whose parte it were to comfort all men with cherefulnesse Yea the preachers of God mind so muche edi  iyng of soules that thei often forgette we have any bodies And therefore some doe not so muche good with tellyng the truthe as thei doe harme with dullyng the hearers beyng so farre gone in their matters that oftentimes thei cannot tell when to make an ende"  fol a Yet still he allows much praise to the preachers in general of his age  "Yea what tell I nowe of suche lessons seeyng God hath raised suche worthy preachers in this our tyme that their godlie and learned doynges maie be a most iuste example for all other to followe"  fol b By the way although a zealous gospeller in another place he obliquely censures the rapacity with which the reformation was conducted under Edward the sixth See supr vol ii p  "I had rather said one make my child a cobler than a preacher a tankardbearer than a scholer For what shall my sonne seke for learnyng when he shall neuer get thereby any livyng Set my sonne to that whereby he mai  get somewhat Doe you not see how euery one catcheth and pulleth from the churche what thei can I feare me one daie they will plu  ke downe churche and all Call you this the GOSPELL when men seke onlie for to prouide for their bellies and care n  t a groate though their soules go to helle A patrone of a benefice will haue a poore yngrame soule to beare the name of a parsone for twentie marke or tenne pounde and the patrone hymself will take vp for his snapshare as good as an hundred marke Thus God is robbed learnyng decaied England dishonoured and honestie not regarded"  fol a  In treating  of pleasaunt sporte made rehearsyng of a whole matter  he says  "Thei that can liuely tell pleasaunt tales and mery dedes doen and set them out as wel with gesture as with voice leauing nothing behinde that maie serue for beautifying of their matter are most mete for this purpose  whereof assuredly ther are but fewe And whatsoeuer he is that can aptlie tell his tale and with countenaunce voice and gesture so temper his reporte that the hearers may still take delite hym coompte I a man worthie to be highlie estemed For vndoubtedly no man can doe any such thing excepte that thei haue a greate mother witte and by experience confirmed suche their comelinesse whervnto by nature thei were most apte Manie a man readeth histories heareth fables seeth worthie actes doen euen in this our age but few can set them out accordinglie and tell them liuelie as the matter selfe requireth to be tolde The kyndes of delityng in this sort are diuers whereof I will set forth many  Sporte moued by tellyng of olde tales  If there be any olde tale or straunge historie well and wittelie applied to some man liuyng all menne loue to heare it of life As if one were called Arthure some good felowe that were wel acquainted with KYNG ARTHURES BOOKE and the Knightes of his Rounde Table would want no matter to make good sport and for a nede would dubbe him knight of the Rounde Table or els proue hym to be one of his kynne or else which were muche proue him to be Arthur himself And so likewise of other names merie panions  Companions A cant word  would make madde pastyme Oftentymes the deformitie of a mannes body giueth matter enough to be right merie or elles a picture in shape like another manne will make some to laugh right hartelye  Fol a  c"  This is no unpleasing image of the arts and accomplishments which seasoned the mirth and enlivened the conversations of our forefathers Their wit seems to have chiefly consisted in mimicry  See  ol a    He thus describes the literary and ornamental qualifications of a young nobleman which were then in fashion and which he exemplifies in the characters of his lamented pupils Henry duke of Suffolk and lord Charles Brandon his brother  He gives a curious reason why a young nobleman had better be born in London than any other place  "The shire or towne helpeth somewhat towardes the encrease of honour As it is much better to be borne in Paris than in Picardie in London than in Lincolne For that bothe the aire is better the people more ciuil and the wealth much greater and the menne for the most parte more wise"  fol a    "I maie commende hym for his learnyng for his skill in the French or in the Italian for his knowledge in cosmographie for his skill in the lawes in the histories of al countrees and for his gift of enditing Againe I maie commende him for playing at weapons for running vpon a great horse for chargyng his staffe at the tilt for vauting for plaiyng upon instrumentes yea and for painting or drawing of a plat as in olde time noble princes muche delited therin  Fol a  "  And again  "Suche a man is an excellent fellowe saithe one he can speake the tongues well he plaies of instrumentes fewe men better he feigneth to the lvte marveilous sweetlie  He mentions the Lute again  "The tongue giueth a certaine grace to euery matter and beauti  ieth the cause in like maner a  a sweete soundyng lute muche setteth forth a meane deuised ballade"  fol a  he  ndites excellentlie but for al this the more is the pitee he hath his faultes he will be dronke once a daie he loues women well c  Fol a  "  The following passage acquaints us among other things that many now studied and with the highest applause to write elegantly in English as well as in Latin  "When we haue learned vsuall and accvstomable wordes to set forthe our meanynge we ought to ioyne them together in apte order that the eare maie delite in hearyng the harmonie I knowe some Englishemen that in this poinct haue suche a gift in the Englishe as fewe in Latin haue the like and therefore delite the Wise and Learned so muche with their pleasaunte composition  that many reioyce when thei maie heare suche and thinke muche learnyng is gotte when thei maie talke with them  This work is enlivened with a variety of little illustrative stories not ill told of which the following is a specimen  "An Italian havyng a sute here in Englande to the archbusshoppe of Yorke that then was and commynge to Yorke when one of the Prebendaries there brake his bread as they terme it and therevpon made a solemne longe diner the whiche perhaps began at eleuen and continued well nigh till fower in the afternoone at the whiche dinner this bisshoppe was It fortvned that as they were sette the Italian knockt at the gate vnto whom the porter perceiuing his errand answered that my lorde bisshoppe was at diner The Italian departed and retourned betwixte twelve and one the porter aunswered they were yet at dinner He came againe at twoo of the clocke the porter tolde hym thei had not half dined He came at three a clocke vnto whom the porter in a heate a  swered neuer a worde but churlishlie did shutte the gates vpon him Wherevpon o  hers told the Italian that ther was no speaking with my Lord almoste all that daie for the solemne diner sake The gentilman Italian wonderyng muche at suche a long sitting and greatly greued because he could not then speake with the archbysshoppes grace departed straight towardes London and leauyng the dispatche of his matters with a der  frende of his toke his iourney towardes Italie Three yeres after it hapened that an Englishman came to Rome with whom this Italian by chaunce fallyng acquainted asked him if he knewe the archbisshoppe of Yorke The Englishman said he knewe hym right well I praie you tell me quoth the Italian  hath that archbishop yet dined  "  The Italian explaining himself they both laughed heartily fol b a  He commends Dr Haddon's latinity which is not always of the purest cast  "There is no better Latine man within England except Gualter Haddon the lawier"  fol a Again he commends a prosopopeia of the duchess of Suffolk in Haddon's  Oratio de vita et obitu fratrum Suffolciensium Henrici et Caroli Brandon  edit Hatcher Lond to p viz LUCU  RATIONES G Haddon fol a  He mentions John Heiwood's PROVERBS See supr p  "The Englishe Proverbes gathered by Jhon Heiwoode helpe well in this behaulfe allegory the which commonlie are nothyng els but Allegories and dark deuised sentences"  fol a Again for furnishing similitudes  "The Prouerbes of Heiwood helpe wonderfull well for thys purpose"  fol b  He condemns in an example the growing practice of mothers who do not suckle their own children which he endeavours to prove to be both against the law of nature and the will of God fol a Here is an early proof of a custom which may seem to have originated in a more luxurious and delicate age  To these miscellaneous extracts I shall only add that our author who was always esteemed a sincere advocate for protestantism and never suspected of leaning to pop  ry speaking of an artificial memory ha  this theory concerning the use of images in churches  "When I see a lion the image thereof abideth faster in my minde than if I should heare some reporte made of a lion Emong all the sences the iye eye sight is most quicke and conteineth the impression of thinges more assuredlie than any of the other sences doe And the rather when a manne both heareth and seeth a thing as by artificiall memorie he do  th almost s  thinges liuely he doeth remember it muche the better The sight printeth thinges in a mans memorie as a seale doeth printe a mans name in waxe And therefore heretofore Ima  s were sett  vp for remembraunce of sainctes to be LAI  ENNES BOOK  S that the rather by seying seein  the pictures of suche men thei might be stirred to followe their good livingMarry for this purpose whereof we now write this would haue serued gailie well"  fol a  "  But he adds the faults which were sometimes now to be found in English composition among which he censures the excess of alliteration  "Some will bee so shorte and in such wise curtall  their sentences that thei had neede to make a commentary immediatelie of their meanyng or els the moste that heare them shal be forced to kepe counsaile Some wil speake oracles that a man can not tell which waie to take them Some will be so fine and so poeticall withall that to their seming there shall not stande one heare hair amisse and yet euery bodie els shall think them meter fitter for a ladies chamber than for an earnest matter in any open assemblySome vse overmuche repetition of one letter as  pitifull povertie prayeth for a penie but pu  ed presumpcion passeth not a poinct pamperyng his panche with pestilent pleasure procuryng his passeport to poste it to hell pitte there to be punished with paines perpetuall  "  Others he blames for the affectation of ending a word with a vowel and beginning the next with another  "Some he says ende their sentences al alike makyng their talke style rather to appere rimed meter than to seme plaine speacheI heard a preacher  Preaching and controversial tracts occasioned much writing in English after the reformation  delityng muche in this kinde of composicion who vsed so often to ende his sentence with woordes like vnto that which went before that in my iudgemente there was not a dosen sentences in his whole sermon but thei ended all in rime for the moste parte Some not best disposed wished the Preacher a Lute that with his rimed sermon he might vse some pleasaunte melodie and so the people might take pleasure diuers waies and daunce if thei liste"  Some writers he observes disturbed the natural arrangement of their words others were copious when they should be concise The most frequent fault seems to have been the rejection of common and proper phrases for those that were more curious refined and unintelligible  Fol a b a One Thomas Wilson translated the DIANA of Montomayer a pas  oral Spanish romance about the year which has been assigned as the original of the TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA He could hardly be our author unless that version was one of his early juvenile exercises This translator Wilson I presume is the person mentioned by Meres as a poet  "Who for learning and extemporall witte in this facultie is without compare or compeere as to his great

seven troubadours or rhetoricians at Tholouse were more famous in their time than the seven sages of Greece  See Verdier ii From an ingenious correspondent who has not given me the honour of his name and who appears to be well acquainted with the manners and literature of Spain I have received the following notices relating to this institution of which other particulars may be seen in the old French History of Languedoc  "At the end of the second volume of Mayan's ORIGINES DE LA LINGUA ESPANOLA printed in duodecimo at Madrid in is an extract from a manuscript entitled  Libro de la Arte de Trovar ò Gaya Sciencia por Don Enrique de Villena  said to exist in the library of the cathedral of Toledo and perhaps to be found in other libraries of Spain It has these particularsThe TROVADORES had their origin at Tholouse about the middle of the twelfth century A CONSISTORIO  de la Gaya Sciencia  was there founded by Ramon Vidal de Besalin containing more than one hundred and twenty celebrated poets and among these princes kings and emperors Their art was extended throughout Europe and gave rise to the Italian and Spanish poetry  servio el Garona de Hippocrene  To Ramon Vidal de Besalin succeeded Jofre de Foxa Monge negro who enlarged the plan and wrote what he called  Continuacion de trovar  After him Belenguer de Troya came from Majorca and compiled a treatise  de Figuras y Colores Rhetoricos  And next Gul Vedal of Majorca wrote  La Suma Vitulina  To support the GAYA SCIENCIA at the poetical college of Tholouse the king of France appropriated privileges and rev  nues appointing seven  Ma  tenedores qu  liciessen L  yes  These constituted the LAWS OF LOVE which were afterwards abridged by Guill Moluier under the title  Tratado de las Flores  Next Fray Ramon framed a system called  Doctrinal  which was censured by Castilnon From thence nothing was written in Spanish on the subject till the time of Don Enrique de VillenaSo great was the credit of the GAY SCIENCE that Don Juan the first king of Arragon who died sent an embassy to the king of France requesting that some Troubadours might be transmitted to teach this art in his kingdom Accordingly two  Mantenedores  were dispatched from Tholouse who founded a college for poetry in Barcelona consi  ting of four Mantenedores a Cavalier a Master in Theology a Mas  er in Laws and an honourable Citizen Disputes about Don Juan's successor occasioned the removal of the college to Tortosa But Don Ferdinand being elected King Don Enrique de Villena was taken into his service who restored the college and was chosen principal The subjects he proposed were sometimes the Praises of the Holy Virgin of Arms of Love  y de buenas Costumbres  An account of the ceremonies of their public Acts then follows in

others by two  Mantenedores  and preceded by minstrels and trumpets where he gave an entertainment of confects and wine"  See supr vol i  There seems to have been a similar establishment at Amsterdam called  R  ederiicke  camer  or the CHAMBER OF RHETORICIANS mentioned by Isaacus Pontanus Who adds  "Sunt autem hi rhetores viri amaeni et poetici spiritus qui lingua vernacula aut prosa aut vorsa

and forty rhetoricians of Brussels appeared on horseback richly but fantastically habited accompanied with an infinite variety of pageantries sports and shows These had a garland as a reward for the superior splendor of their entry Many days were spent in determining the grand questions during which there were  eastings bonfires farces tumbling and every popular diversion BEL  HISTOR VNIVERSAL

dated still higher Goujet mentions a Gothic edition of this tract in  BI  L FR He mentions another edition in Both at Paris mo  It contains remarks on the versification of mysteries and farces and throws many lights on the old French writers  But the French had even an ART OF POETRY so early as the year In that year Thomas Sibilet published his  Art poetique  at Paris  Veuve  François Regnault  In mo  This piece preserves many valuable anecdotes of the old French poetry and among other particulars which develope the state of the old French drama has the following sensible strictures  "The French farce contains little or nothing of the Latin comedy It has neither acts nor scenes which would only serve to introduce a tedious prolixity for the true subject of the French farce or SOTTIE is every sort of foolery which has a tendency to provoke laughterThe subject of the Greek and Latin comedy was totally different from every thing on the French stage For it had more morality than drollery and often as much truth as fiction Our MORALITIES hold a place indifferently between tragedy and comedy but our farces are  really what the Romans called mimes or  Priapées  the intended end and effect of which was excessive laughter and on that account they admitted all kinds of licentiousness as our farces do at present In the mean time their pleasantry does not derive much advantage from rhymes however flowing of eight syllables  Liv ii ch viii At the end of Sibilet's work is a critical piece of Quintil against Ch Fontaine first printed separately at Paris mo  "  Sibilet's work is chiefly founded on Horace His definitions are clear and just and his precepts well explained The most curious part of it is the enumeration of the poets who in his time were of most repute Jacques Pelletier du Mans a physician a mathematician a poet and a voluminous writer on various subjects both in prose and verse also published an ART POETIQUE at Lyons in  By Jean de Tournes vo  This critic had sufficient penetration to perceive the false and corrupt taste of his cotemporaries  "Instead of the regular ode and sonnet our language is sophisticated by  ballads roundeaux lays  and  triolets  But with these we must rest contented till the farces which have so long infatuated our nation are converted into comedy our martyrplays into tragedy and our romances into heroic poems  Ch de L'ODE  "  And again  "We have no pieces in our language written in the genuine comic form except some affected and unnatural MORALITIES and other plays of the same character which do not deserve the name of comedy The drama would appear to advantage did it but resume its proper state and antient dignity We have however some tragedies in French learnedly translated among which is the HECUBA of Euripides by Lazare de Baïf c  Ch DE LA COMEDIE ET DE LA TRAGEDIE See also to the same purpose Collettet  Sur la poesie morale  and Guillaume des Autels  Repos d'  n plus grand  travail  "  Of rhyme the same writer says  "S'il n'etoit question que de parler ornement il ne faudroit sinon écrire en prose ou s'il n'etoit question que de rimer il ne faudroit sinon rimer en farceur mais en poesie il faut faire tous les deux et BIEN DIRE et  BIEN RIMER  Liv ii ch i De la RIM    "  His chapters on IMITATION and TRANSLATION have much more philosophy and reflection than are to be expected for his age and contain observations which might edify modern critics  See Liv i ch v and vi  Nor must I forget that Pelletier also published a French translation of Horace's ART OF POETRY at Paris in  Par Michel Vascosan vo  I presume that Joachim du Bellay's  Deffense et Illustration de la  LANGUE FRANÇOISE was published at no great distance from the year He has the same just notion of the drama  "As to tragedies and comedies if kings and states would restore them in their antient glory which has been usurped by farces and MORALITIES I am of opinion that you would lend your assistance and if you wish to adorn our language you know where to find models  Liv ii ch iv  "  The Italian vernacular criticism began chiefly in commentaries and discourses on the language and phraseology of Dante Petrarch and Boccace I believe one of the first of that kind is  "Le tre Fontane di Nicolò Liburnio sopra la grammatica e l'eloquenza di Dante del Petrarcha e del Boccacio In Venezia per Gregorio Gregori  In quarto Again per Marchio Sessa vo  "  Numerous expositions lectures annotations and discourses of the same sort especially on Dante's Inferno and the Florentine dialect appeared soon afterwards Immediately after the publication of their respective poems Ariosto whose ORLANDO FURIOSO was styled the  nuova poesia  and Tasso were illustrated or expounded by commentators more intricate than their text One of the earliest of these is  "Sposizione de Simon Fornari da Reggio sopra l'Orlando Furioso di Lodovico Ariosto In Firenze per Lorenzo Torrentino  In vo The  Seconde Partie  appeared ibid vo  "  Perhaps the first criticism on what the Italians call the Volgar Lingua is by Pietro Bembo  "Prose di Pietro Bembo della volgar Lingua divise in tre libri In  Firenze per Lorenzo Torrentino  In quarto  "  But the first edition seems to have been in This subject was discussed in an endless succession of  Regole grammaticali Osservazioni Avvertimenti  and  Ragionamenti  Here might also be mentioned the annotations although they are altogether explanatory which often accompanied the early translations of the Greek and Latin classics into Italian But I resign this labyrinth of research to the superior opportunities and abilities of the French and Italian antiquaries in their native literature To have said nothing on the subject might have been thought an omission and to have said more impertinent I therefore return to our own poetical annals  Our three great poets Chaucer Gower and Lydgate seem to have maintained their rank and to have been in high reputation during the period of which we are now treating Splendid impressions of large works were at this time great undertakings A sumptuous edition of Gower's CONFESSIO AMANTIS was published by Berthelette in On the same ample plan in Robert Braham printed with great accuracy and a diligent investigation of the antient copies the first correct edition of Lydgate's TROYBOKE  Nothing can be more incorrect than the first edition in  I have before incidentally remarked  See supr vol ii p  that Nicholas Briggam a polite scholar a student at Oxford and at the Inns of Court and a writer of poetry in the year deposited the bones of Chaucer under a new tomb erected at his own cost and inscribed with a new epitaph in the chapel of bishop Blase in Westminster abbey which still remains  Undoubtedly Chaucer was originally buried in this place Leland  ites a Latin elegy or NAENIA of thirtyfour lines which he says was composed by Stephanus Surigonius of Milan at the request of William Caxton the printer and which Leland adds was written on a white tablet by Surigoniu  on a pillar near Chaucer's grave in the south ile at Westminster SCRIPT BRIT GALPRID CHAUCERUS See Caxton's EPILOGUE to Chaucer's BOOKE OF FAME in Caxton's CHAUCER Wood says that Briggam  "exerci  d his muse much in poetry and took great delight in the works of Jeffrey Chaucer for whose memory he had so great a respect that he removed his bones into the south crossile or transept of S Peter's church c"  ATH OXON i I do not apprehend there was any removal in this case from one part of the abbey to another Chaucer's  omb has appropriated this aile or transept to the sepulture or to the honorary monuments of our poets  Wilson as we have just seen in a citation from his RHETORIC records an anecdote that the more accomplished and elegant courtiers were perpetually quoting Chaucer Yet  this must be restricted to the courtiers of Edward the sixth And indeed there is a peculiar reason why Chaucer exclusive of his real excellence should have been the favorite of a court which laid the foundations of the reformation of religion It was that his poems abounded with satyrical strokes against the corruptions of the church and the dissolute manners of the monks And undoubtedly Chaucer long before a lively and popular writer greatly assisted the doctrines of his cotemporary Wickliffe in opening the eyes of the people to the absurdities of popery and exposing its impostures in a vein of humour and pleasantry Fox the martyrologist a weak and a credulous compiler perhaps goes too far in affirming that Chaucer has undeniably proved the pope to be the antichrist of the apocalypse  Tom ii p edit    Of the reign of queen Mary we are accustomed to conceive every thing that is calamitous and disgusting But when we turn our eyes from its political evils to the objects which its literary history presents a fair and flourishing scene appears In this prospect the mind feels a repose from contemplating the fates of those venerable prelates who suffered the most excruciating death for the purity and inflexibility of their faith and whose unburied bodies dissipated in ashes and undistinguished in the common mass have acquired a more glorious monument than if they had been interred in magnificent shrines which might have been visited by pilgrims loaded with superstitious gifts and venerated with the pomp of mistaken devotion  SECT XXXVIII  THE first poem which presents itself at the commencement of the reign of queen Elisabeth is the play of GORDOBUC written by Thomas Sackville lord Buckhurst the original contriver of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES  It is scarcely worth observing that one Thomas Brice at the accession of Elisabeth printed in English metre a  Register of the Martyrs and Confessors

progress of our drama much less to examine the merit of particular plays But as this piece is perhaps the first specimen in our language of an heroic tale written in blank verse divided into acts and scenes and cloathed in all the formalities of a regular tragedy  it seems justly to deserve a more minute and a distinct discussion in this general view of our poetry  It was first exhibited in the great Hall of the Inner Temple by the students of that Society as part of the entertainment of a grand Christmas and afterwards before queen Elisabeth at Whitehall on the eighteenth day of January in It was never intended for the press But being surreptitiously and very carelessly printed in an exact edition with the consent and under the inspection of the authors appeared in in black letter thus entitled  "The TRAGIDIE OF FERREX AND PORREX set forth without addition or alteration but altogether as the same was showed on stage before the queenes Majestie about nine yeare past viz The xviij day of Januarie By the gentlemen of the Inner  Temple Seen and allowed c Imprinted at London by John Daye dwelling ouer Aldersgate"  It has no date nor notation of pages and contains only thirtyone leaves in small octavo  For the benefit of those who wish to gain a full and exact information about this edition so as to distinguish it from all the rest I will here exhibit the arrangement of the lines of the title page  "The Tragidie of Ferrex and Porrex set forth without addition or alteration but altogether as the same was shewed on stage before the queenes maiestie about nine yeares past  vz  the

pamphlets against the papists by Thomas Norton  In the edition of it is called the TRAGEDIE OF GORDOBUC The whole title of that edition runs thus  "The Tragedie of Gordobuc whereof three actes were

London and neither of them both made priuy put it forth exceedingly corrupted c"  W G is William Griffith the printer in Fleet street abovementioned Mr Garrick had another old quarto edition printed by Alde in  These are the circumstances of the fable of this tragedy Gordobuc a king of Britain about six hundred years before Christ made in his lifetime a division of his kingdom to his sons Ferrex and Porrex The two young princes within five years quarrelled for universal sovereignty A civil was ensued and Porrex  lew his elder brother Ferrex Their mother Viden who loved Ferrex best revenged his death by entering Porrex's chamber in the night and murthering him in his sleep The people exa  perated at the cruelty and treachery of this murther rose in rebellion and killed both Viden and Gordobuc The nobility then assembled collected an army and destroyed the  rebels An intestine war commenced between the chief lords the succession of the crown became uncertain and arbitrary for want of the lineal royal issue and the country destitute of a king and wasted by domestic slaughter was reduced to a state of the most miserable desolation  In the dramatic conduct of this tale the unities of time and place are eminently and visibly violated a defect which Shakespeare so frequently commits but which he covers by the magic of his poetry The greater part of this long and eventful history is included in the representation But in a story so fertile of bloodshed no murther is committed on the stage It is worthy of remark that the death of Porrex in the bedchamber is only related Perhaps the players had not yet learned to die nor was the ponyard so essential an article as at present among the implements of the propertyroom Nor is it improbable that to kill a man on the stage was not now avoided as a spectacle shocking to humanity but because it was difficult and inconvenient to be represented The writer has followed the series of facts related in the chronicles without any material variation or fictitious embarrassments and with the addition only of a few necessary and obvious characters  There is a Chorus of Four Antient and Sage Men of Britain who regularly close every Act the last excepted with an ode in longlined stanzas drawing back the attention of the audience to the substance of what has just passed and illustrating it by recapitulatory moral reflections and poetical or historical allusions Of these the best is that which terminates the fourth Act in which prince Porrex is murthered by his mother Viden These are the two first stanzas  When greedie lust in royall seat to reigne  Hath reft all care of goddes and eke of men  And Cruell Heart Wrath Treason and Disdaine  Within th' ambicious breast are lodged then  Behold howe MISCHIEFE wide herselfe displaies  And with the brothers hand the brother slaies  When blood thus shed doth staine the heauens face  Crying to Joue for vengeaunce of the deede  The mightie god euen moueth from his place  With wrath to wreak Then sendes he forth with spede  The dreadful Furies daughters of the night  With serpents girt carrying the whip of ire  With haire of stinging snakes and shining bright  With flames and blood and with a brande of fire  These for reuenge of wretched murder done  Do make the mother kill her onelie son  Blood asketh blood and death must death requite  Joue by his iust and euerlasting doom  Justly hath euer so required it c  Act iv Sc ult    In the imagery of these verses we discern no faint traces of the hand which drew the terrible guardians of hellgate in the INDUCTION to the MIRROUR of MAGISTRATES  The moral beauties and the spirit of the following ode which closes the third act will perhaps be more pleasing to many readers  The lust of kingdom  Kingdoms edit  knowes no sacred faithe  No rule of reason no regarde of right  No kindlie loue no feare of heauens wrathe  But with contempt of goddes and man's despight  Through blodie slaughter doth prepare

from which doth flo  The dead black streames of mourning  Mournings edit  plaint and wo  Act iii Sc ult    Every Act is introduced as was the custom in our old plays with a piece of machinery called the DUMB SHOW shadowing by an allegorical exhibition the matter that was immediately to follow In the construction of this spectacle and its personifications much poetry and imagination was often displayed It is some apology for these prefigurations that they were commonly too mysterious and obscure to forestal the future events with any degree of clearness and precision Not that this mute mimicry was always typical of the ensuing incidents It sometimes served for a compendious introduction of such circumstances as could not commodiously be comprehended within the bounds of the representation It sometimes supplied deficiencies and covered the want of business Our ancestors were easily satified with this artificial supplement of one of the most important unities which abundantly filled up the interval that was necessary to pass while a hero was expected from the Holy Land or a princess was imported married and brought to bed  mean time the greater part of the audience were probably more pleased with the emblematical pageantry than the poetical dialogue although both were alike unintelligible  I will give a specimen in the DOMME SHEWE preceding the fourth act  "First the musick of howeboies began to plaie Duringe whiche there came forth from vnder the stage as thoughe out of hell three Furies ALECTO MEGERA and CTESIPHONE  Tisiphone  clad in blacke garments sprinkled with bloud and flames their bodies girt with snakes their heds spread with serpents instead of heare the one bearing in her hande  snake the other a whip and the thirde a burning firebrande eche driuynge before them a kynge and a queene which moued by Furies vnnaturally had slaine their owne children The names of the kinges and queenes were these TANTALUS MEDEA ATHAMAS INO CAMBISES ALTHEA After that the Furies and these had passed aboute the stage thrise they departed and then the musicke ceased Hereby was signified the vnnaturall murders to followe that is to saie Porrex slaine by his owne mother And of king Gordobuc and queene Viden killed by their owne subjectes"  Here by the way the visionary procession of kings and queens long since dead evidently resembles our author Sackville's original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES and for the same reason reminds us of a similar train of royal spectres in the tentscene of Shakespeare's KING RICHARD THE THIRD  I take this opportunity of expressing my surprise that this ostensible comment of the Dumb Shew should not regularly appear in the tragedies of Shakespeare There are even proofs that he treated it with contempt and ridicule Although some critics are of opinion that because it is never described in form at the close or commencement of his acts it was therefore never introduced Shakespeare's aim was to collect an audience and for this purpose all the common expedients were necessary No  dr  matic writer of his age has more battles or ghosts His representations abound with the usual appendages of mechanical terror and he adopts all the superstitions of the theatre This problem can only be resolved into the activity or the superiority of a mind which either would not be entangled by the formality or which saw through the futility of this unnatural and extrinsic ornament It was not by declamation or by pantomime that Shakespeare was to fix his eternal dominion over the hearts of mankind  To return to Sackville That this tragedy was never a favorite among our ancestors and had long fallen into general oblivion is to be attributed to the nakedness and uninteresting nature of the plot the tedious length of the speeches the want of a discrimination of character and almost a total absence of pathetic or critical situations It is true that a mother kills her own son But this act of barbarous and unnatural impiety to say nothing of its almost unexampled atrocity in the tender sex proceeds only from a brutal principle of sudden and impetuous revenge It is not the consequence of any deep machination nor is it founded in a proper preparation of previous circumstances She is never before introduced to our notice as a wicked or designing character She murthers her son Porrex because in the commotions of a civil dissension in selfdefence after repeated provocations and the strongest proofs of the basest ingratitude and treachery he had slain his rival brother not without the deepest compunction and remorse for what he had done A mother murthering a son is a fact which must be received with horror but it required to be complicated with other motives and prompted by a cooperation of other causes to rouse our attention and work upon our passions I do not mean that any other motive could have been found to palliate a murther of such a nature Yet it was possible to heighten and to divide the di  tress by rendering this bloody mother under the notions of human frailty an object of our compassion as well as of our abhorrence But perhaps these artifices were not yet known  or wanted The general story of the play is great in its political consequences and the leading incidents are important but not sufficiently intricate to awaken our curiosity and hold us in suspence Nothing is perplexed and nothing unravelled The opposition of interests is such as does not affect our nicer feelings In the plot of a play our pleasure arises in proportion as our expectation is excited  Yet it must be granted that the language of GORDOBUC has great purity and perspicuity and that it is entirely free from that tumid phraseology which does not seem to have taken place till playwriting had become a trade and our poets found it their int  rest to captivate the multitude by the false sublime and by those exaggerated imageries and pedantic metaphors which are the chief blemishes of the scenes of Shakespeare and which are at this day mistaken for his capital beauties by too many readers Here also we perceive another and a strong reason why this play was never popular  Sir Philip Sydney in his admirable DEFENCE OF POESIE remarks that this tragedy is full of  notable moralitie  But tragedies are not to instruct us by the intermixture of moral sentences but by the force of example and the effect of the story In the first act the three counsellors are introduced debating about the division of the kingdom in long and elaborate speeches which are replete with political advice and maxims of civil prudence But this stately sort of declamation whatever eloquence it may display and whatever policy it may teach is undramatic unanimated and unaffecting Sentiment and argument will never supply the place of a  tion upon the stage Not to mention that these grave harangues have some tincture of the formal modes of address and the ceremonious oratory which were then in fashion But we must allow that in the strain of dialogue in which they are professedly written they have uncommon merit even without drawing an apology in their favour from their antiquity and that they contain much dignity strength of reflection and good sense couched in clear expression  and polished numbers I shall first produce a specimen from the speech of Arostus who is styled a Coun  ellor to the King and who is made to defend  specious yet perhaps the least rational side of the question  And in your lyfe while you shall so beholde  Their rule their vertues and

the topic is not agitated with that opposition of opinion and variety of arguments which it naturally suggests and which would have enlivened the disputation and displayed diversity of character But Eubulus the king's secretary declares his sentiments with some freedom and seems to be the most animated of all our three political orators  To parte your realme vnto my lords your sonnes  I think not

Ibid    The illustration from Brutus is here both apposite and poetical  Spence with a reference to the situation of the author lord Buckhurst in the court of queen Elisabeth has observed in his preface to the modern edition of this tragedy that  "'tis no wonder if the language of kings and statesmen should be less happily imitated by a poet than a privy counsellor"  This is an insinuation that Shakespeare who has left many historical tragedies was less able to conduct some parts of a royal story than the statesman lord Buckhurst But I will venture to pronounce that whatever merit there is in this play and particularly in the speeches we have just been examining it is more owing to the poet than the privy counsellor If a first minister was to write a tragedy I believe the piece will be the better the less it has of the first minister When a statesman turns poet I should not wish him to fetch his ideas or his language from the canbinet I know not why a king should be better qualified than a private man to make kings talk in blank verse  The chaste elegance of the following description of a region abounding in every convenience will gratify the lover of classical purity

narration of the murther of Porrex by the queen which many poets of a more enlightened age would have exhibited to the spectators is perhaps the most moving and pathetic speech in the play The reader will observe that our author yet to a good purpose has transferred the ceremonies of the tournament to the court of an old British king  O queene of adamante O marble breaste  If not the fauour of his

of honour and a modern writer of tragedy would have made her in love with the young prince who is murthered  The queen laments the loss of her eldest and favorite son whose defeat and death had just been announced in the following  oliloquy The ideas are too general although happily expressed but there is some imagination in her wishing the old massy palace had long ago fallen and crushed her to death  Why should I lyue and lynger forth my time  In longer liefe to double my distresse  O me most wofull wight whome no mishap  Long ere this daie could haue bereued hence  Mought not these handes

be immediately descended from the Trojan Brutus and that consequently they were acquainted with the pagan history and mythology Gordobuc has a long allusion to the miseries of the siege of Troy  Act

notions of subordination of the royal authority and the divine institution of kings predominated in the reign of queen Elisabeth it is extraordinary that eight lines inculcating in plain terms the doctrine of passive and unresisting obedience to the prince which appeared in the fifth act of the first edition of this tragedy should have been expunged in the edition of published under the immediate inspection of the authors  See Signat D V edit  It is well known that the Calvinists carried their ideas of reformation and refinement into government as well as religion and it seems probable that these eight verses were suppressed by Thomas Norton Sackville's supposed assistant in the play who was not only an active and I believe a sensible puritan but a licencer of the publication of books under the commission of the bishop of London  For ins  ance  "  Seven steppes to heaven also The seven p  almes reduced into meter by W Hunnys The honny succles  c"  by Hunnys Nov

said on better authority than that of Antony Wood who supposes GORDOBUC to have been in old English rhime that the three first acts were written by Thomas Norton and the two last by Sackville But the force of internal evidence often prevails over the authority of assertion a testimony which is diminished by time and may be rendered suspicious from a variety of other circumstances Throughout the whole piece there is an invariable uniformity of diction and versification Sackville has two poems of considerable  length in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES which fortunately furnish us with the means of comparison and every scene of GORDOBUC is visibly marked with his characteristical manner which consists in a perspicuity of style and a command of numbers superior to the tone of his times  The same may be said of Sackville's SONNET prefixed to Thomas Hoby's English version of Castiglio's I  CORTEGIANO first printed in The third part on  the behaviour of Courtladies  appears to have been translated in at the request of the marchioness of Northampton  Thomas Norton's poetry is of a very different and a subordinate cast and if we may judge from his share in our metrical psalmody he seems to have been much more properly qualified to shine in the miserable mediocrity of Sternhold's stanza and to write spiritual rhymes for the solace of his illuminated brethren than to reach the bold and impassioned elevations of tragedy  SECT XXXIX  THIS appearance of a regular tragedy with the division of acts and scenes and the accompaniment of the antient chorus represented both at the Middletemple and at Whitehall and written by the most accomplished nobleman of the court of queen Elisabeth seems to have directed the attention of our more learned poets to the study of the old classical drama and in a short time to have produced vernacular versions of the JOCASTA of Euripides as it is called and of the ten Tragedies of Seneca I do not find that it was speedily followed by any original compositions on the same legitimate model  The JOCASTA of Euripides was translated by George Gascoigne and Francis Kinwelmersh both students of Graysinn and acted in the refectory of that society in the year Gascoigne translated the second third and fifth acts and Kinwelmersh the first and fourth It was printed in Gascoigne's poems of which more will be said hereafter in under the following title  "JOCASTA a Tragedie written in Greeke by Euripides Translated and digested into Acte by George Gascoigne and Francis Kinwelmershe of Graies inn and there by them presented An "  The Epilogue was written in quatraines by Christopher Yelverton then one of their brother students So strongly were our audiences still attached to spectacle that the authors did not venture to present their play without introducing a DUMB SHEW at the beginning of every act For this however they had the example and authority of GORDOBUC Some of the earliest specimens of Inigo Jones's Grecian architecture are marred by Gothic ornaments  It must however be observed that this is by no means a just or exact translation of the JOCASTA that is the PHOENISSAE of Euripides It is partly a paraphrase and partly an abridgement of the Greek tragedy There are many omissions retrenchments and transpositions The chorus the characters and the substance of the story are entirely retained and the tenor of the dialogue is often preserved through whole scenes Some of the beautiful odes of the Greek chorus are neglected and others substituted in their places newly written by the translators In the favorite address to Mars  See PHOENISS pag edit Barnes  c  Gascoigne has totally deserted the rich imagery of Euripides yet has found means to form an original ode which is by no means destitute of pathos or imagination  O fierce and furious Mars whose harmefull hart  Reioiceth most to shed the giltlesse blood  Whose headie will doth all the world subvart  And doth enuie the pleasant merry mood  Of our estate that erst in quiet stood  Why dost thou thus our harmlesse towne annoy  Whych mighty Bacchus gouerned in ioy  Father of warre and death that doost remoue  With wrathfull wrecke from wofull mothers brest  The trusty pledges of their tender loue  So graunt the goddes that for our finall rest  Dame Venus' pleasant lookes may please thee best  Whereby when thou shalt all amazed stand  The sword may fall out of thy trembling hand  So Tibullus where he cautions Mar  not to gaze on his mistress Lib iv ii  At tu violente caveto  Ne tibi miranti turpiter arma cadant    And thou mayst proue some other way ful wel  The bloody prowess of thy mighty speare  Wherewith thou raisest from the depth of hel  The wrathful sprites of all the Furies there  Who when they wake do wander euery where  And neuer rest to range about the costes  T' enrich that pit with spoyle of damned ghostes  And when thou hast our fields forsaken thus  Let cruel DISCORD beare thee company  Engirt with snakes and serpents venemous  Euen She that can with red vermilion die  The gladsome greene that florisht pleasantly  And make the greedy ground a drinking cvp  To sup the blood of murdered bodies vp  Yet thou returne O Ioie and pleasant Peace  From whence thou didst against our willes depart  Ne let thy worthie mind from trauel cease  To chase disdayne out of the poysned heart  That raysed warre to all our paynes and smart  Euen from the breast of Oedipus his sonne  Whose swelling pride hath all this iarre begon c  Act ii Sc ult    I am of opinion that our translators thought the many mythological and historical allusions in the Greek chorus too remote and unintelligible perhaps too cumbersome to be exhibited in English In the ode to CONCORD which finishes the fourth act translated by Kinwelmershe there is great elegance of expression and versification It is not in Euripides  O blissefull CONCORD bred in sacred brest  Of hym that rules the restlesserolling skie  That to the earth for mans assured rest  From height of heauens vouchsafest downe to flie  In thee alone the mightie power doth lie  With sweet accorde to keepe the frowning starres  And euerie planet els from hurtful warres  In thee in thee such noble vertue bydes  As may commaund the mightiest gods to bend  From thee alone such sugred frendship slydes  As mortall wights can scarcely

death doth flitting life remoue  And looke howe fast to death man payes his due  So fast agayne doest thou his stock renue  By thee the basest thing aduanced is  Thou euery where doest graffe such golden peace  As filleth man with more than earthly blisse  The earth by thee doth yeelde her sweete increase  At beck of thee al bloody discords cease  And mightiest realmes in quyet do remayne  Whereas thy hand doth hold the royall rayne  But if thou fayle then all things gone to wrack  The mother then doth dread her natural childe  Then euery towne is subject to the sack  Then spotles

how souldiers wounded lie  With gasping breath and yet they cannot die c  Act iv Sc ult    The constant practice of ending every act with a long ode sung by the chorus seems to have been adopted from GORDOBUC  It may be proper to observe here that the tragedy of TANCRED and GISMUND acted also before the queen at the Innertemple in has the chorus The title of this play not printed till shews the quick gradations of taste It is said to be  "Newlie revived and polished according to the decorum of these daies by R W Lond printed by T Scarlet c "  to R W is Robert Wilmot mentioned with applause as a poet in Webbe's DISCOURSE Signat C The play was the jointproduction of five students of the society Each seems to have taken an act At the end of the fourth is  Composuit Chr Hatton  or sir Christopher Hatton undoubtedly the same that was afterwards exalted by the queen to the office of lord Keeper for his agility in dancing    But I will give a specimen of this performance as a translation from that affecting scene in which Oedipus blind and exiled from the city is led on by his daughter Antigone the rival in filial fidelity of Lear's Cordelia to touch the dead and murthered bodies of his queen Jocasta and his sons Eteocles and Polynices It appears to be the chief fault of the translators that they have weakened the force of the original which consists in a pathetic brevity by needless dilatations and the affectations of circumlocution The whole dialogue in the original is carried on in single lines Such however is the pregnant simplicity of the Greek language that it would have been impossible to have rendered line for line in English  OEDIPUS  Daughter I must commend thy noble heart  ANTIGONE  Father I will not liue in company  I will not marry    And you alone wander in wildernes  OEDIPUS  O yes dear daughter leaue thou me alone  Amid my plagues be merry while thou mayst  ANTIGONE  And who shall guide these aged feete of yours  That banisht beene in

in some measure how far these two poets who deserve much praise for even an attempt to introduce the Grecian drama to the notice of our ancestors have  succeeded in translating this scene of the

application of all the torments of hell to Atreus's unparalleled guil  of feasting on the bowels of his children furnishes a sort of nauseous bombast which not only violates the laws of criticism but

beginning of the second act he has added a new scene in which he introduces the spectre of Achilles raised from hell and demanding the sacrifice of Polyxena This scene which is in the octave stanza has much of the air of one of the legends in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES To the chorus of this act he has subjoined three stanzas Instead of translating the chorus of the third act which abounds with the hard names of the antient geography and which would both have puzzled the translator and tired the English reader he has substituted a new ode In his preface to the reader from which he appears to be yet a fellow of All Souls college he modestly apologises for these licentious innovations and hopes to be pardoned for his seeming arrogance in attempting  "to set forth in English this present

Merton college But inheriting too large a share of his father's facetious and free disposition he sometimes in the early part of life indulged his festive vein in extravagancies and indiscretions for which being threatened with expulsion he resigned his fellowship  See Harrington's Epigrams  "Of old Haywood's sonnes"  B ii  He exercised the office of Christmasprince or lord of misrule to the

habitual course of studious and industrious pursuits he had acquired a considerable fortune a portion of which he bequeathed in charitable legacies  It is remarkable that Shakespeare has borrowed nothing from the English Seneca Perhaps a copy might not fall in his way Shakespeare was only a reader by accident Hollinshed and translated Italian novels supplied most of his plots or stories His storehouse of learned history was North's Plutarch The only poetical fable of antiquity which he has worked into a play is TROILUS But this he borrowed from the romance of Troy Modern fiction and English history were his principal resources These perhaps were more suitable to his taste at least he found that they produced the most popular subjects Shakespeare was above the bondage of the classics  I must not forget to remark here that according to Ames among the copies of Henry Denham recited in the register of the Company of Stationers  I find nothing of this in REGISTER B  that

its royalty  SECT XL  BUT as scholars began to direct their attention to our vernacular poetry many more of the antient poets now appeared in English verse Before the year Homer Musaeus Virgil Horace Ovid and Martial were translated Indeed most of these versions were published before the year For the sake of presenting a connected display of these early translators I am obliged to trespass in a slight degree on that chronological order which it has been my prescribed and constant method to observe In the mean time we must remember that their versions while they contributed to familiarise the ideas of the antient poets to English readers improved our language and versification and that in a general view they ought to be considered as valuable and important accessions to the stock of our poetical literature These were the classics of Shakespeare  I shall begin with those that were tran  lated first in the reign of Elisabeth But I must premise that this inquiry will necessarily draw with it many other notices much to our purpose and which could not otherwise have been so conveniently disposed and displayed  Thomas Phaier already mentioned as the writer of the story of OWEN

from its familiarity was tuned to this measure It was now used in most works of length and gravity but seems to have been consecrated to translation Whatever absolute and original dignity it may boast at present it is almost  ridiculous from an unavoidable association of ideas and because it necessarily recalls the tone of the versification of the puritans I suspect it might have acquired a degreee of importance and reverence from the imaginary merit of its being the established poetic vehicle of scripture and its adoption into the celebration of divine service  I take this opportunity of

so strong the principles of a general decorum that a writer of the present age who was to print loveverses in this style would be severely reproached and universally proscribed I will instance only in the AFFECTIONATE SHEPHERD of Richard Barnefielde printed in Here through the course of twenty sonnets not inelegant and which were exceedingly popular the poet bewails his unsuccessful love for a

Pauls  It will perhaps be sufficient barely to mention Spenser's CULEX which is a vague and arbitrary paraphrase of a poem not properly belonging to Virgil From the testimony of many early Latin writers it may be justly concluded that Virgil wrote an elegant poem with this title Nor is it improbable that in the CU  EX at present attributed to Virgil some very few of the original phrases and even verses may remain under the accumulated incrustation of critics imitators interpolators and paraphrasts which corrupts what it conceals But the texture the character and substance of the genuine poem is almost entirely lost The CEIRIS or the fable of Nisus and Scylla which follows although never mentioned by any writer of antiquity has much fairer pretensions to genuineness At least the CEIRIS allowing for uncommon depravations of time and transcription appears in its present state to be a poem of the Augustan age and is perhaps the identical piece dedicated to the Messala whose patronage it solicits It has that rotundity of versification which seems to have been studied after the Roman poetry emerged from barbarism  It has a general simplicity and often a native strength of colouring nor is it tinctured except by the casual innovation of grammarians with those sophistications both of sentiment and expression which afterwards of course took place among the Roman poets and which would have betrayed a recent forgery It seems to be the work of a young poet but its digressions and descriptions which are often too prolix are not only the marks of a young poet but of early poetry It is interspersed with many lines now in the Eclogues Georgics and Eneid Here is an argument which seems to assign it to Virgil A cotemporary poet would not have ventured to steal from poems so well known It was natural at least allowable for Virgil to steal from a performance of his youth on which he did not set any great value and which he did not scruple to rob of a few ornaments deserving a better place This consideration excludes Cornelius Gallus to whom Fontanini with much acute criticism has ascribed the CEIRIS Nor for the reason given would Virgil have stolen from Gallus The writer has at least the art of Virgil in either suppressing or throwing into shade the trite and uninteresting incidents of the common fabulous history of Scylla which were incapable of decoration or had been preoccupied by other poets The dialogue between the young princess Scylla who is deeply in love and her nurse has much of the pathos of Virgil There are some traces which discover an imitation of Lucretius but on the whole the structure of the verses and the predominant cast and manner of the composition exactly resemble the ARGONAUTICA of Catullus or the EPITHALAMIUM of PELEUS AND THETIS I will instance in the following passage in which every thing is distinctly and circumstantially touched and in an affected pomp of numbers He is alluding to the stole of Minerva interwoven with the battle of the giants and exhibited at Athens in the magnificent Panathenaic festival The classical reader will perceive one or two interpolations and lament that this rich piece of embroidery  has suffered a little from being unskilfully darned by another and a more modern artificer  Sed magno intexens si fas est dicere peplo  Qualis Erectheis olim portatur Athenis  Debita cum castae  olvuntur vota Minervae  Tardaque confecto redeunt quinquennia lustro  Cum levis alterno Zephyrus concrebuit Euro  Et prono gravidum provexit pondere cursum  Felix ille dies felix et dicitur annus  Felices qui talem annum videre diemque  Ergo Palladiae texuntur in ordine pugnae  Magna Gigantaeis ornantur pepla tropaeis  Horrida sanguineo pinguntur praelia cocco  Additur aurata dejectus cuspide Typho  Qui prius Ossaeis consternens aethera saxis  Emathio celsum duplicabat vertice Olympum  Tale deae velum solemni in tempore portant  Ver seq    The same stately march of hexameters is observable in Tibullus's tedious panegyric on Messala a poem which if it should not be believed to be of Tibullus's hand may at least from this reasoning be adjudged to his age We are sure that Catullus could not have been the author of the CEIRIS as Messala to whom it is inscribed was born but a very few years before the death of Catullus One of the chief circumstances of the story is a purple lock of hair which grew on the head of Nisus king of Megara and on the preservation of which the safety of that city now besieged by Minos king of Crete entirely depended Scylla Nisus's daughter falls in love with Minos whom she sees from the walls of Megara she finds means to cut off this sacred ringlet the city is taken and she is married to Minos I am of opinion that Tibullus in the following passage alludes to the CEIRIS then newly published  and which he points out by this leading and fundamental fiction of Nisus's purple lock  Pieridas pueri doctos et amate poetas  Aurea nec superent munera Pieridas  CARMINE PURPUREA est Nisi coma carmina ni sint  Ex humero Pelopis non nituisset ebur  ELEG Lib i iv    Tibullus here in recommending the study of the poets to the Roman youth illustrates the power of poetry and for this purpose with much address he selects a familiar instance from a piece recently written perhaps by one of his friends  Spenser seems to have shewn a particular regard to these two little poems supposed to be the work of Virgil's younger years Of the CULEX he has left a paraphrase under the title of VIRGIL'S GNAT dedicated to lord Leicester who died in It was printed

even left London on the most frivolous enterprise without a pastoral in his praise or a panegyric in metre which were sold and sung in  the streets Having interested himself in the fashionable poetry of the times he was placed high in the ideal Arcadia now just established and among other instances which might be brought on his return from Portugal in he was complimented with a poem called  "An

orator when he is led to a formal defence of the value and dignity of poetry instead of illustrating his subject by insisting on the higher utilities of poetry its political nature and its importance to society enlarges only on the immortality which the art confers on the poetic faculty being communicated by divine inspiration on the public honours paid to Homer and Ennius on the esteem with which poets were regarded by Alexander and Themistocles on the wonderful phenomenon of an extemporaneous  ffusion of a great number of verses and even recurs to the trite and obvious topics of a schoolboy

euery knowing and iudicious interpreter not to follow the number and order of words but the materiall things themselues and sentences to weigh diligently and to clothe and adorne them with words and such a stile and forme of oration as are most apt for the language into which they are conuerted"  The danger lies in too lavish an application of this sort of cloathing that it may not disguise what it should only adorn I do not say that this is Chapman's fault but he has by no means represented the dignity or the simplicity Homer He is sometimes paraphrastic and redundant but more frequently retrenches or impoverishes what he could not feel and express In the mean time he labours with the inconvenience of an aukward inharmonious and unheroic measure imposed by custom but disgustful to modern ears Yet he is not always without strength or spirit He has enriched our language with many compound epithets so much in the manner  of Homer such as the  silverfooted  Thetis the  silverthroned  Juno the  triplefeathered  helme the  highwalled  Thebes the  faire  aired  boy the  silverflowing  floods the  hugelypeopled  towns the Grecians  navybound  the  strongwinged  lance and many more which might be collected Dryden reports that Waller never could read Chapman's Homer without a degree of transport Pope is of opinion that Chapman covers his defects  "by a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself to have writ before he arrived to years of discretion"  But his fire is too frequently darkened by that sort of fustian which now disfigured the diction of our tragedy  He thus translates the comparison of Diomed to the autumnal star at the beginning of the fifth book The lines are in his best manner  From his bright helme and shield did burne a most unwearied fire  Like rich Autumnus' golden lampe whose brightnesse men admire  Past all the other host of starres when with his chearefull

observer will easily discern that Pope was no careless reader of his rude predecessor Pope complains that Chapman took advantage of an unmeasureable length of line But in reality Pope's lines are longer than Chapman's If Chapman affected the reputation of rendering line for line the specious expedient of chusing a protracted measure which concatenated two lines together undoubtedly favoured his usual propensity to periphrasis  Chapman's commentary is only incidental contains but a small degree of critical excursion and is for the most part a pedantic compilation from Spondanus He has the

to lord Buckhurst  At the end is a short copy of verses by Abraham Fleming See supr p    From the title of this work ZODIACUS VITAE written in Latin hexameters by Marcello Palingeni an Italian about the year the reader at least expects some astronomical allusions But it has not the most distant connection with the stars except that the poet is once transported to the moon not to measure her diameter but for a moral purpose and that he once takes occasion in his general survey of the world and in reference to his title to introduce a philosophic explanation of the zodiacal system  B  i AQUARIUS  The author meaning to divide his poem into twelve books chose to distinguish each with a name of the celestial  signs just as Herodotus but with less affectation and inconsistency marked the nine books or divisions of his history with the names of the nine Muses Yet so strange and pedantic a title is not totally without a conceit as the author was born at Stellada or Stellata a province of Ferrara and from whence he calls himself Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus  It should have been STELLATENSIS    This poem is a general satire on life yet without peevishness or malevolence and with more of the solemnity of the censor than the petulance of the satirist Much of the morality is couched under allegorical personages and adventures The Latinity is tolerably pure but there is a mediocrity in the versification Palingenius's transitions often discover more quickness of imagination and fertility of reflection than solidity of judgment Having started a topic he pursues it through all its possible affinities and deviates into the most distant and unnecessary digressions Yet there is a facility in his manner which is not always unpleasing nor is the general conduct of the work void of art and method He moralises with a boldness and a liberality of sentiment which were then unusual and his maxims and strictures are sometimes tinctured with a spirit of libertinism which without exposing the opinions must have offended the gravity of the more orthodox ecclesiastics He fancies that a confident philosopher who rashly presumes to scrutinise the remote mysteries of nature is shewn in heaven like an ape for the public diversion of the gods A thought evidently borrowed by Pope  See ESSAY ON POPE p  Although he submits his performance to the sentence of the church he treats the authority of the popes and the voluptuous lives of the monks with the severest acrimony It was the last circumstance that chiefly contributed to give this poem almost the rank of a classic in the reformed countries and probably produced an early English translation After his death he was pronounced an heretic and his body was taken up and committed to the flames A measure  which only contributed to spread his book and disseminate his doctrines  Googe seems chiefly to have excelled in rendering the descriptive and flowery passages of this moral ZODIAC He thus describes the Spring  The earth againe doth florishe greene  The trees repaire their springe  With pleasaunt notes the nightingale  Beginneth new to sing  With flowers fresh their heads bedeckt  The Fairies dance in fielde  And wanton songes in mossye dennes  The Drids and Satirs yielde  The wynged Cupide fast doth cast  His dartes of gold yframed c  B ii TAURUS Signat B iij    There is some poetic imagination in SAGITTARIUS or the ninth book where a divine mystagogue opens to the poet's eyes an unknown region of infernal kings and inhabitants But this is an imitation of Dante As a specimen of the translation and of the author's fancy I will transcribe some of this imagery  Now open wyde your springs and playne  Your caues abrode displaye  You sisters of Parnassus hyll  Beset about with baye  And vnto me for neede it is  A hundred tongues in verse  Sende out that I these ayrie kings  And people may rehearse  Here fyrst whereas in chariot red  Aurora fayre doth ryse  And bright from out the

G G iiij    Then follows a mixture of classical and christian history and mythology This poem has many symptoms of the wildness and wanderings of Italian fiction  It must be confessed that there is a perspicuity and a freedom in Googe's versification But this metre of Sternhold and Hopkins impoverished three parts of the poetry of queen Elisabeth's reign A hermit is thus described who afterwards

cannot but remark that the conduct and machinery of the old visionary poems is commonly the same A rural scene generally a wilderness is supposed An imaginary being of consummate wisdom a hermit a goddess or an angel appears and having purged the poet's eye with a few drops of some celestial elixir conducts him to the top of an inaccessible mountain which commands an unbounded plain filled with all nations A cavern opens and displays the torments of the damned he next is introduced into heaven by way of the moon the  only planet which was thought big enough for a poetical visit Although suddenly deserted by his mystic intelligencer he finds himself weary and desolate on the seashore in an impassable forest or a flowery meadow  The following is the passage which Pope has copied from Palingenius and as Pope was a great reader of the old English poets it is most probable that he took it immediately from our translator or found it by his direction  Pope's lines are almost too wellknown to be transcribed  Superiour beings whe  of late they saw  A mo  tal man unfold all nature's law  Admir'd such wisdom in an earthy shape  And shew'd a Newton as we shew an Ape    An Ape

vnprofitable member and of the ancient mother of learned men the Newcollege in Oxford"  This version was printed in and dedicated from Kingston to sir William Fiztwilliams  Feb There were other

seen elsewhere printed at London by R Watkins in  Sm vo  In this book the old Spanish paraphrast mentions Boccace's THESEID  Fol a    But it was not only to these later and degenerate classics and to modern tracts that Googe's industry was confined He also translated into English what he called Aristotle's TABLE OF THE TEN CATEGORIES  MSS Coxeter  that capital example of ingenious but  useless subtlety of method which cannot be applied to practice and of that affectation of unnecessary deduction and frivolous investigation which characterises the philosophy of the Greeks and which is conspicuous not only in the demonstrations of Euclid but in the Socratic disputations recorded by Xenophon The solid simplicity of common sense would have been much less subject to circumlocution embarrassment and ambiguity We do not want to be told by a chain of proofs that two and two make four This specific character of the schools of the Greeks is perhaps to be traced backwards to the loquacity the love of paradox and the fondness for argumentative discourse so peculiar to their nation Even the good sense of Epictetus was not proof against this captious phrenzy What patience can endure the solemn quibbles which mark the stoical conferences of that philosopher perserved by Arrian It is to this spirit not solely from a principle of invidious malignity that Tully alludes where he calls the Greeks  "Homines contentionis quam veritatis cupidiores  De ORATORE Lib i § xi  "  And in another part of the same work he says that it is a principal and even a national fault of this people  "Quocunque in loco quoscunque inter homines visum est de rebus aut DIFFICILLIMIS aut non NECESSARIIS ARGUTISSIME DISPUTARE  Ibid Lib ii § iv  "  The natural liveliness of the Athenians heightened by the free politics of a democracy seems to have tinctur  d their conversation with this sort of declamatory disputation which they frequently practiced under an earnest pretence of discovering the truth but in reality to indulge their native disposition to debate to display their abundance of words and their address of argument to amuse surprise and perplex Some of Plato's dialogues professing a profundity of speculation have much of this talkative humour  Beside these versions of the Greek and Roman poets and of the antient writers in prose incidentally mentioned in this review it will be sufficient to observe here in general that almost all the Greek and Roman classics appeared in English before the year The effect and influence of these translations on our poetry will be considered in a future section  SECT XLII  BUT the ardour of translation was not now circumscribed within the bounds of the classics whether poets historians orators or critics of Greece and Rome  I have before observed that with our frequent tours through Italy and our affectation of Italian manners about the middle of the sixteenth century the Italian poets became fashionable and that this circumstance for a time at least gave a new turn to our poetry The Italian poets however were but in few hands and a practice of a more popular and general nature yet still resulting from our communications with Italy now began to prevail which produced still greater revolutions This was the translation of Italian books chiefly on fictitious and narrative subjects into English  The learned Ascham thought this novelty in our literature too important to be passed over without observation in his reflections on the course of an ingenuous education It will be much to our purpose to transcribe what he has said on this subject although I think his arguments are more like the reasonings of a rigid puritan than of a man of liberal views and true penetration and that he endeavours to account for the origin and to state the consequences of these translations more in the spirit of an early calvinistic preacher than as a sensible critic or a polite scholar  "These be the inchauntments of Circe brought out of Italie to marre mens manners in England much by example of ill life but more by precepts of fonde bookes of late translated oute of Italian into English solde in euery shop in London commended by honest titles the sooner to corrupt  honest manners dedicated ouer boldly to vertuous and honorable personages the easelyer to beguile simple and honest wittes It is pitty that those which haue authoritie and charge to allow and disallow works to be printed be no more circumspect herein than they are Ten Sermons at Paules Crosse doe not so much good for moouing men to true doctrine as one of these bookes does harme with inticing men to ill living Yea I say farther these bookes tend not so much to corrupt honest liuing as they do  to subuert true religion More papists be made by your merry bookes of Italy than by your earnest bookes of Louain  Serious book  in divinity written by the papists The study of controversial theology flourished at the univ  rsity of Louvain  When the busie and open papists could not by their contentious bookes turne men in Englande faste inough from troth and right iudgemente in doctrine then the suttle and secret papists at home procured bawdie bookes to be translated out of the Italian toong whereby ou  rmany yong willes and witts allured to wantonnes doe now boldly conte  ne all seuere bookes that sound to honestie and godlines In our forefathers time when papistrie as a standing poole couered and ouerflowed all England few bookes were red in our toong sauyng certayne Bookes of Chiualrie as they sayd for pastime and pleasure which as some say were made in monasteries by idle monkes or wanton chanons as one for example MORTE ARTHUR the whole pleasure of which booke standeth in two specyall poyntes

Launcelote with the wife of king Arthure his maister syr Tristram with the wife  of king Marke his vn  le syr Lamerocke with the wife of king Lote that was his own aunte This is good stuffe for wise men to laughe at or honest men to take pleasure at Yet I knowe when God's Bible was banished the court and  MORTE ARTHUR receaued into the princes chamber What toyes the dayly reading of such a booke may worke in the will of a yong ientleman or a yong maide that liueth welthely and idlely wife men can iudge and honest men doe pittie And yet ten MORTE ARTHURES doe not the tenth part so much harme as one of these bookes made in Italie and translated in England They open not fond and common ways to vice but such suttle cunning new and diuerse shifts to carry yong willes to vanitie and yong wittes to mischiefe to teache old bawdes new schoole pointes as the simple head of an Englishman is not hable to inuent nor neuer was heard of in England before yea when papistrie ouerflowed all Suffer these bookes to be read and they shall soon displace all bookes of godly learning For they carrying the will to vanitie and marring good manners shall easily corrupt the minde with ill opinions and false judgement in doctrine first to thinke ill of all true religion and at last to thinke nothing of God himselfe one speciall poynt that is to be learned in Italie and Italian bookes And that which is most to be lamented and therefore more nedefull to be looked to there be more of these vngracious bookes set out in print within these fewe moneths than haue been seene in England many score

Tullies Offices than saint Paules  Epistles of a Tale in Boccace than the Story of the Bible c  Ascham's SCHOOLEMASTER edit fol a seqq This book was begun soon after the year PREFACE p  "  Ascham talkes here exactly in the style of Prynne's HISTRIOMASTIX It must indeed be confessed that by these books many pernicious obscenities were circulated and perhaps the doctrine of intrigue more accurately taught and exemplified than before But every advantage is attended with its inconveniencies and abuses That to procure translations of Italian tales was a plot of the papists either for the purpose of facilitating the propagation of their opinions of polluting the minds of our youth or of diffusing a spirit of scepticism I am by no means convinced But I have nothing to do with the moral effects of these versions I mean only to shew their influence on our literature more particularly on our poetry although I reserve the discussion of this point for a future section At present my design is to give the reader a full and uniform view of the chief of these translations from the Italian which appeared in England before the year  I will begin with Boccace The reader recollects Boccace's THESEID and TROILUS many of his Tales and large passages from Petrarch and Dante translated by Chaucer But the golden mine of Italian fiction opened by Chaucer was soon closed and forgotten I must however premise that the Italian language now began to grow so fashionable that it was explained in lexicons and grammars written in English and with a view to the illustration of the three principal Italian poets So early as were published  "Principal rules of the Italian grammar with a dictionarie for the better vnderstanding of Boccase Petrarche and Dante g  thered into this tonge by

greatest reason to believe that no third volume ever appeared And it is probable that Painter by the interest of his booksellers in compliance with the prevailing mode of publication and for the accommodation of universal readers was afterwards persuaded to print his  sundry novels  in the perishable form of separate pamphlets which cannot now be recovered  Boccace's FIAMETTA was translated

by the natural and obvious conclusion of the story In Luigi's novel Juliet awakes from her trance in the tomb before the death of Romeo From Turberville's poems printed in we learn that Arthur Brooke was drowned in his passage to Newhaven and that he was the author of this translation which was the distinguished proof of his excellent poetical abilities  Apollo lent him lute for solace sake  To

SUPPOSITI which was acted the same year at Gray'sinn The title is  "SVPPOSES A comedie written in the Italian tongue by Ariosto Englished by George Gascoigne of Graies inne esquire and there presented  See Gascoigne's HEAR  S fol  "  This comedy was first written in prose by Ariosto and afterwards reduced into rhyme Gascoigne's translation is in prose The dialogue is supported with much spirit and ease and has often the air of a modern conversation As Gascoigne was the first who exhibited on our stage a story from Euripides so in this play he is the first that produced an English comedy in prose By the way the quaint name of Petruchio and the incident of the master and servant changing habits and characters and persuading the Scenese to personate the father by frightening him with the hazard of his travelling from Sienna to Ferrara against the commands of government  was transferred into the TAMING OF THE SHREW I doubt not however that there was an Italian novel on the subject From

informed by the late Mr Collins of Chichester that Shakespeare's TEMPEST for which no origin is yet assigned was formed on this favorite romance But although this information has not proved true on examination an useful conclusion may be drawn from it that Shakespeare's story is somewhere to be found in an Italian novel at least that the story preceded Shakespeare Mr Collins had searched this subject with no less fidelity than judgment and industry but his memory failing in his last calamitous indisposition he probably gave me the name of one novel for another I remember he added a circumstance which may lead to a discovery that the principal character of the romance answering to Shakespeare's Prospero was a chemical necromancer who had bound a spirit like Ariel to obey his call and perform his services It was a common pretence of the dealers in the occult sciences to have a demon at command At least Aurelio or Orelio was probably one of the names of this romance the production and multiplication of gold being the grand object of alchemy Taken at large the magical part of the TEMPEST is founded in that sort of philosophy which was practised by John Dee and his associates and has been called the Rosicrusian The name Ariel came from the Talmudistic mysteries with which the learned Jews had infected this science  To this head must also be referred the Collections which appeared before of tales drawn indiscriminately from French and Spanish as well as Italian authors all perhaps originally of Italian growth and recommended by the general love of fable and fiction which now prevailed I will mention a few  In point of selection and size perhaps the most capital miscellany of this kind is Fenton's book of tragical novels The title is  "Certaine

and original Italian novelists either by immediate translation or through the mediation of Spanish French or Latin versions by paraphrase abridgement imitation and often under the disguise of licentious innovations of names incidents and characters appeared in an English dress before the close of the reign of Elisabeth and for the most part even before the publication of the first volume

shelter this section under the authority of a polite and judicious Roman writer  "Sit apud te honos ANTIQUITATI sit ingentibus factis sit FABULIS quoque  Plin EPIST viii  "  SECT XLIII  ENOUGH has been opened of the reign of queen Elisabeth to afford us an opportunity of forming some general reflections tending to establish a full estimate of the genius of the poetry of that reign and which by drawing conclusions from what has been said and directing the reader to what he is to expect will at once be recapitulatory and preparatory Such a survey perhaps might have stood with more propriety as an introduction to this reign But it was first necessary to clear the way by many circumstantial details and the regular narration of those particulars which lay the foundation of principles and suggest matter for discursive observation My sentiments on this subject shall therefore compose the concluding section of the present volume  The age of queen Elisabeth is commonly called the golden age of English poetry It certainly may not improperly be styled the most POETICAL age of these annals  Among the great features which strike us in the poetry of this period are the predominancy of fable of fiction and fancy and a predilection for interesting adventures and pathetic events I will endeavour to assign and explain the cause of this characteristic distinction which may chiefly be referred to the following principles sometimes blended and sometimes operating singly The revival and vernacular versions of the classics the importation and translation of Italian novels the visionary reveries or refinements of false philosophy a degree of superstition sufficient for the purpose  of poetry the adoption of  the machineries of romance and the frequency and improvements of allegoric exhibition in the popular spectacles  When the corruptions and impostures of popery were abolished the fashion of cultivating the Greek and Roman learning became universal and the literary character was no longer appropriated to scholars by profession but assumed by the nobility and gentry The ecclesiastics had found it their interest to keep the languages of antiquity to themselves and men were eager to know what had been so long injuriously concealed Truth propagates truth and the mantle of mystery was removed not only from religion but from literature The laity who had now been taught to assert their natural privileges became impatient of the old monopoly of knowledge and demanded admittance to the usurpations of the clergy The general curiosity for new discoveries heightened either by just or imaginary ideas of the treasures contained in the Greek and Roman writers excited all persons of leisure and fortune to study the classics The pedantry of the present age was the politeness of the last An accurate comprehension of the phraseology and peculiarities of the antient poets historians and orators which yet seldom went farther than a kind of technical erudition was an indispensable and almost the principal object in the circle of a gentleman's education Every young lady of fashion was carefully instituted in classical letters and the daughter of a duchess was taught not only to distil strong waters but to construe Greek Among the learned females of high distinction queen Elisabeth herself was the most conspicuous Roger Ascham her preceptor speaks with rapture of her astonishing progress in the Greek nouns and declares with no small degree of triumph that during a long residence at Windsorcastle she was accustomed to read more Greek in a day than  "some prebendary of that church did Latin in one week  SCHOOLEMASTER p  b edit to  "  And although perhaps a princess looking out words in a lexicon and writing down hard phrases  from Plutarch's Lives may be thought at present a more incompatible and extraordinary character than a canon of Windsor understanding no Greek and but little Latin yet Elisabeth's passion for these acquisitions was then natural and resulted from the genius and habitudes of her age  The books of antiquity being thus familiarised to the great every thing was tinctured with antient history and mythology The heathen gods although discountenanced by the Calvinists on a suspicion of their tending to cherish and revive a spirit of idolatry came into general vogue When the queen paraded through a countrytown almost every pageant was a pantheon When she paid a visit at the house of any of her nobility at entering the hall she was saluted by the Penates and conducted to her privychamber by Mercury Even the pastrycooks were expert mythologists At dinner select transformations of Ovid's metamorphoses were exhibited in confectionary and the splendid iceing of an immense historic plumbcake was embossed with a delicious bassorelievo of the destruction of Troy In the afternoon when she condescended to walk in the garden the lake was covered with Tritons and Nereids the pages of the family were converted into Woodnymphs who peeped from every bower and the footmen gamboled over the lawns in the figure of Satyrs I speak it without designing to insinuate any unfavourable suspicions but it seems difficult to say why Elisabeth's virginity should have been made the theme of perpetual and excessive panegyric nor does it immediately appear that there is less merit or glory in a married than a maiden queen Yet the next morning after sleeping in a room hung with the tapestry of the voyage of Eneas when her majesty hunted in the Park she was met by Diana who pronouncing our royal prude to be the brightest paragon of unspotted chastity invited her to groves free from the intrusions of Acteon The truth is she was so profusely flattered for this virtue because it was esteemed the characteristical ornament of the heroines as fantastic honour was the chief pride of the champions of the old barbarous romance  It was in conformity to the sentiments of chivalry which still continued in vogue that she was celebrated for chastity the compliment however was paid in a classical allusion  Queens must be ridiculous when they would appear as women The softer attractions of sex vanish on the throne Elisabeth sought all occasions of being extolled for her beauty of which indeed in the prime of her youth she possessed but a small share whatever might have been her pretensions to absolute virginity Notwithstanding her exaggerated habits of dignity and ceremony and a certain affectation of imperial severity she did not perceive this ambition of being complimented for beauty to be an idle and unpardonable levity totally inconsistent with her high station and character As she conquered all nations with her arms it matters not what were the triumphs of her eyes Of what consequence was the complexion of the mistress of the world Not less vain of her person than her politics this stately coquet the guardian of the protestant faith the terror of the sea the mediatrix of the factions of France and the scourge of Spain was infinitely mortified if an embassador at the first audience did not tell her she was the finest woman in Europe No negociation succeeded unless she was addressed as a goddess Encomiastic harangues drawn from this topic even on the supposition of youth and beauty were surely superfluous unsuitable and unworthy and were offered and received with an equal impropriety Yet when she rode through the streets of the city of Norwich Cupid at the command of the mayor and aldermen advancing from a groupe of gods who had left Olympus to grace the procession gave her a golden arrow the most effective weapon of his wellfurnished quiver which under the influence of such irresistible charms was sure to wound the most obdurate heart  "A gift says honest Hollinshed which her majesty now verging to her fiftieth year received very thankfullie  CHRON iii f  "  In one of the fulsome interludes at  court where she was present the singingboys of her chapel presented the story of the three rival goddesses on mount Ida to which her majesty was ingeniously added as a fourth and Paris was arraigned in form for adjudging the golden apple to Venus which was due to the queen alone  This inundation of classical pedantry soon infected our poetry Our writers already trained in the school of fancy were suddenly dazzled with these novel imaginations and the divinities and heroes of pagan antiquity decorated every composition The perpetual allusions to antient fable were often introduced without the least regard to propriety Shakespeare's Mrs Page who is not intended in any degree to be a learned or an affected lady laughing at the cumbersome courtship of her corpulent lover Falstaffe says  "I had rather be a giantess and lie under mount Pelion  MERRY W Act ii Sc i  "  This familiarity with the pagan story was not however so much owing to the prevailing study of the original authors as to the numerous English versions of them which were consequently made The translations of the classics which now employed every pen gave a currency and a celebrity to these fancies and had the effect of diffusing them among the people No sooner were they delivered from the pale of the scholastic languages than they acquired a general notoriety Ovid's metamorphoses just translated by Golding to instance no farther disclosed a new world of fiction even to the illiterate As we had now all the antient fables in English learned allusions whether in a poem or a pageant were no longer obscure and unintelligible to common readers and common spectators And here we are led to observe that at this restoration of the classics we were first struck only with their fabulous inventions We did not attend to their regularity of design and justness of sentiment A rude age beginning to read these writers imitated their extravagancies not their natural beauties And these like other novelties were pursued to a blameable excess  I have before given a sketch of the introduction of classical stories in the splendid show exhibited at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn But that is a rare and a premature instance and the pagan fictions are there complicated with the barbarisms of the catholic worship and the doctrines of scholastic theology Classical learning was not then so widely spread either by study or translation as to bring these learned spectacles into fashion to frame them with sufficient skill and to present them with propriety  Another capital source of the poetry peculiar to this period consisted in the numerous translations of Italian tales into English These narratives not dealing altogether in romantic inventions but in real life and manners and in artful arrangements of fictitious yet probable events afforded a new gratification to a people which yet retained their antient relish for taletelling and became the fashionable amusement of all who professed to read for pleasure They gave rise to innumerable plays and poems which would not otherwise have existed and turned the thoughts of our writers to new inventions of the same kind Before these books became common affecting situations the combination of incident and the pathos of catastrophe were almost unknown Distress especially that arising from the conflicts of the tender passion had not yet been shewn in its most interesting forms It was hence our poets particularly the dramatic borrowed ideas of a legitimate plot and the complication of facts necessary to constitute a story either of the comic or tragic species In proportion as knowledge encreased genius had wanted subjects and materials These pieces usurped the place of legends and chronicles And although the old historical songs of the minstrels contained much bold adventure heroic enterprise and strong touches of rude delineation yet they failed in that multiplication and disposition of circumstances and in that description of characters and events approaching nearer to truth and reality which were demanded by a more  discerning and curious age Even the rugged features of the original Gothic romance were softened by this sort of reading and the Italian pastoral yet with some mixture of the kind of incidents described in Heliodorus's Ethiopic history now newly translated was engrafted on the feudal manners in Sydney's ARCADIA  But the reformation had not yet destroyed every delusion nor disinchanted all the strong holds of superstition A few dim characters were yet legible in the mouldering creed of tradition Every goblin of ignorance did not vanish at the first glimmerings of the morning of science Reason suffered a few demons still to linger which she chose to retain in her service under the guidance of poetry Men believed or were willing to believe that spirits were yet hovering around who brought with them  airs from heaven or blasts from hell  that the ghost was duely released from his prison of torment at the sound of the curfue and that fairies imprinted mysterious circles on the turf by moonlight Much of this credulity was even consecrated by the name of science and profound speculation Prospero had not yet  broken and buried his staff  nor  drowned his book deeper than did ever plummet sound  It was now that the alchymist and the judicial astrologer conducted his occult operations by the potent intercourse of some preternatural being who came obsequious to his call and was bound to accomplish his severest services under certain conditions and for a limited duration of time It was actually one of the pretended feats of these fantastic philosophers to evoke the queen of the Fairies in the solitude of a gloomy grove who preceded by a sudden rustling of the leaves appeared in robes of transcendent lustre  Lilly's LIFE p  The Shakespeare of a more instructed and polished age would not have given us a magician darkening the sun at noon the sabbath of the witches and the cauldron of incantation  Undoubtedly most of these notions were credited and entertained in a much higher degree in the preceding periods But the arts of composition had not then made a sufficient progress nor would the poets of those periods have managed them with so much address and judgement We were now arrived at that point when the national credulity chastened by reason had produced a sort of civilized superstition and left a set of traditions fanciful enough for poetic decoration and yet not too violent and chimerical for common sense Hobbes although no friend to this doctrine observes happily  "In a good poem both judgement and fancy are required but the fancy must be more eminent because they please for the EXTRAVAGANCY but ought not to displease by INDISCRETION  LEVIATH Part i ch viii  "  In the mean time the Gothic romance although somewhat shook by the classical fictions and by the tales of Boccace and Bandello still maintained its ground and the daring machineries of giants dragons and inchanted castles borrowed from the magic storehouse of Boiardo Ariosto and Tasso began to be employed by the epic muse These ornaments have been censured by the bigotry of precise and servile critics as abounding in whimsical absurdities and as unwarrantable deviations from the practice of Homer and Virgil The author of AN ENQUIRY INTO THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF HOMER is willing to allow a fertility of genius and a felicity of expression to Tasso and Ariosto but at the same time complains that  "quitting life they betook themselves to aerial beings and Utopian characters and filled their works with Charms and Visions the modern Supplements of the Marvellous and Sublime The best poets copy nature and give it such as they find it When once they lose sight of this they write false be their talents ever so great  SECT V p  "  But what shall we say of those Utopians the Cyclopes and the Lestrigons in the Odyssey The hippogrif of Ariosto may be opposed to the harpies of Virgil If leaves  are turned into ships in the Orlando nymphs are transformed into ships in the Eneid Cacus is a more unnatural savage than Caliban Nor am I convinced that the imagery of Ismeno's necromantic forest in the Gierusalemme Liberata guarded by walls and battlements of fire is less marvellous and sublime than the leap of Juno's horses in the Iliad celebrated by Longinus for its singular magnificence and dignity  IL  AD V Longin § ix  On the principles of this critic Voltaire's Henriad may be placed at the head of the modern epic But I forbear to anticipate my opinion of a system which will more properly be considered when I come to speak of Spenser I must however observe here that the Gothic and pagan fictions were now frequently blended and incorporated The Lady of the Lake floated in the suite of Neptune before queen Elisabeth at Kenilworth Ariel assumes the semblance of a seanymph and Hecate by an easy association conducts the rites of the weird sisters in Macbeth  Allegory had been derived from the religious dramas into our civil spectacles The masques and pageantries of the age of Elisabeth were not only furnished by the heathen divinities but often by the virtues and vices impersonated significantly decorated accurately distinguished by their proper types and represented by living actors The antient symbolical shews of this sort began now to lose their old barbarism and a mixture of religion and to assume a degree of poetical elegance and precision Nor was it only in the conformation of particular figures that much fancy was shewn but in the contexture of some of the fables or devices presented by groupes of ideal personages These exhibitions quickened creative invention and reflected back on poetry what poetry had given From their familiarity and public nature they formed a national taste for allegory and the allegorical poets were now writing to the people Even romance was turned into this channel In the Fairy Queen allegory is wrought upon chivalry and the feats and figments of Arthur's round table  are moralised The virtues of magnificence and chastity are here personified but they are imaged with the forms and under the agency of romantic knights and damsels What was an afterthought in Tasso appears to have been Spenser's premeditated and primary design In the mean time we must not confound these moral combatants of the Fairy Queen with some of its other embodied abstractions which are purely and professedly allegorical  It may here be added that only a few critical treatises and but one ART OF POETRY were now written Sentiments and images were not absolutely determined by the canons of composition nor was genius awed by the consciousness of a future and final arraignment at the tribunal of taste A certain dignity of inattention to niceties is now visible in our writers Without too closely consulting a criterion of correctness every man indulged his own capriciousness of invention The poet's appeal was chiefly to his own voluntary feelings his own immediate and peculiar mode of conception And this freedom of thought was often expressed in an undisguised frankness of diction A circumstance by the way that greatly contributed to give the flowing modulation which now marked the measures of our poets and which soon degenerated into the opposite extreme of dissonance and asperity Selection and discrimination were often overlooked Shakespeare wandered in pursuit of universal nature The glancings of his eye are from heaven to earth from earth to heaven We behold him breaking the barriers of imaginary method In the same scene he descends from his meridian of the noblest tragic sublimity to puns and quibbles to the meanest merriments of a plebeian farce In the midst of his dignity he resembles his own Richard the second the  skipping king  who sometimes discarding the state of a monarch  Mingled his royalty with carping fools  FIRST P HENRY iv Act iii Sc ii    He seems not to have seen any impropriety in the most abrupt transitions from dukes to buffoons from senators to sailors from counsellors to constables and from kings to clowns Like Virgil's majestic oak  Quantum vertice ad auras  Aetherias tantum radice in Tartara tendit  GEOR  ii      No Satires properly so called were written till towards the latter end of the queen's reign and then but a few Pictures drawn at large of the vices of the times did not suit readers who loved to wander in the regions of artificial manners The Muse like the people was too solemn and reserved too ceremonious and pedantic to stoop to common life Satire is the poetry of a nation highly polished  The importance of the female character was not yet acknowledged nor were women admitted into the general commerce of society The effect of that intercourse had not imparted a comic air to poetry nor softened the severer tone of our versification with the levities of gallantry and the familiarities of compliment sometimes perhaps operating on serious subjects and impe  ceptibly spreading themselves in the general habits of style and thought I do not mean to insinuate that our poetry has suffered from the great change of manners which this assumption of the gentler  ex or rather the improved state of female education has produced by giving elegance and variety to life by enlarging the sphere of conversation and by multiplying the topics and enriching the stores of wit and humour But I am marking the peculiarities of composition and my meaning was to suggest that the absence of so important a circumstance from the modes and constitution of ant  ent life must have influenced the cotemporary poetry Of the state of manners among our ancestors respecting this point many traces remain Their style of courtship may be collected from the lovedialogues of Hamlet young  Percy Henry the fifth and Master Fenton Their tragic heroines their Desdemonas and Ophelias although of so much consequence in the piece are degraded to the background In comedy their ladies are nothing more than MERRY WIVES plain and chearful matrons who stand upon the  chariness of their honesty  In the smaller poems if a lover praises his mistress she is complimented in strains neither polite nor pathetic without elegance and without affection she is described not in the address of intelligible yet artful panegyric not in the real colours and with the genuine accomplishments of nature but as an eccentric ideal being of another system and as inspiring sentiments equally unmeaning hyperbolical and unnatural  All or most of these circumstances contributed to give a descriptive a picturesque and a figurative cast to the poetical language This effect appears even in the prose compositions of the reign of Elisabeth In the subsequent age prose became the language of poetry  In the mean time general knowledge was encreasing with a wide diffusion and a hasty rapidity Books began to be multiplied and a variety of the most useful and rational topics had been discussed in our own language But science had not made too great advances On the whole we were now arrived at that period propitious to the operations of original and true poetry when the coyness of fancy was not always proof against the approaches of reason when genius was rather directed than governed by judgement and when taste and learning had so far only disciplined imagination as to suffer its excesses to pass without censure or controul for the sake of the beauties to which they were allied  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME
