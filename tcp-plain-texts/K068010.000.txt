VVrit that this glorious Universe bespangled with gaudy Fires and every where adorn'd with wonderful Objects proclaiming the wisdom  nd  Omnipotence  of the Great  Workmaster  who in Six Days erected all things or his Pleasure was at first drawn out of Nothing or at most a Formless  Chaos  of  onfusion a disordered and confounded heap  jarring Elements toss'd and jumbled to  ether under the dismal Shades of dying Night Eldest of Things no Fruit or Plea  re no Creature that had Breath had being  the place this lower world possesses till  od out of the Abundance of his Goodness  nt forth his Holy Spirit who Dove like with mighty outspread VVings s  t brood  g on the vast  Abyss  and made it pregnant  hen Light put Darkness soon to Flight and  the glorious Lamp  of Heaven appear all  reatures soon had Being and every Plant  ree Herb or Flower of fragant Smell  ung from the verdant Earth rais'd by  ommand above the VVaters every thing  use having Seed in it self that no second  eation needed But still that Lordly  reature who should rule other Creatures  being wanting he was framed more glorious than all the Creatures as not made without mature Counsel and Deliberation and stamped in the Divine Similitude inspired with the infused Breath of Life beyond what any other Creature durst to boast The Contemplation of which long since made the Royal Psalmist break out into this Rapture  What is Man that thou art mindful of him and the Son of Man that thou visitest him Thou madest him a little lower than the Angels and hast crowned him with Glory and Honour Thou makest him to have Dominion over the wo  k  of thy Hands and hast put all thing  under his Feet  Psal    Thus  I say  when God had created the world and furnished it with whatsoever seemed good i  his Sight and that there was nothing wantin  for necessary use Commodity and Pleasure i  seemed good to him then to make one that migh  use them to his Glory and take delight in re  joicing in them Wherefore when Natures Or  naments were all compleat he brought Man in  to the World as into his own possession an  that he might not be disconsolate nor solitary gave him a Woman for a Helper and Comp  nion infusing into them a Fource of Love an  Desire towards each other and of procreating their Likeness having prepared for that purpose a swelling Humour or Spirit and organical Parts and that the one through fear of neglect should not be induced to decline the Society of the other he added Allurements and Desire of mutual Embracings that so they might in Procreation be sweetly affected and delighted by wondrous Ways For unless this was natural to all kind of Creatures they would be regardless of Posterity and Proc  eation would cease whereby Mankind would quickly be lost and the Affairs of Mortals of no continuance But that this passionate Desire might strongly operate as well in sensual Felicity as on the Imagination God has firmly impressed it on all Creatures subject thereto both Male and Female but more especially on Man And lest it should prove unruly in him and not easily subdued he has thought it convenient to prescribe him Bounds and confine him to the Vse of the Matrimonial Bed that so  they  might not defile themselves with wandring Lust  who  want the  Gift  of  Continency  Wherefore so soon as Copulation is finished and the Woman happens to prove with Child great is Nature's Cunning in furnishing the  Embryo  with convenient Nutriment that at the set time when Nine Months are run over  Man  that  Ruler  and  Ornament  of the  Sublunary World  may  come forth in relation to which Mystery of Generation Holy  Job  in the Tenth Chapter of his Book thus expresses himself  Hast thou not poured me out as Milk and curdled me like Cheese Thou hast cloathed me with Skin and Flesh and hast senced me with Bones and Sinews Thou bast granted me Life and Favour and thy Visitation hath preserved my Spirit  But not to be too tedious upon this Subject I shall proceed to unravel the  Mistery  of  Generation  and divers other  Misteries  which I hope will be to the Satisfaction of the Learned and Ingenious of the Age whose Discretion I need not doubt will keep them from wresting it to any other end than what it was designed for  viz  The Benefit and Advantage of the m  dest of either Sex not desiring that this Book should fal into the Hands of any  Obscene  and  Wanton Person  whose Folly or Malice may turn that into Ridicule that loudly proclaims the Infinite Wisdom of an Omnipotent Creator who by his mighty working is able to subdue all things to himself  Gloria Deo in Excelsis  Aristotle's  MasterPiece OR The  Secrets  of  Generation  Display'd  c  CHAP I Of Marriage and at what Age  Virgins  and  Youths  are capable of the MarriageBed and the Reasons that prompts them to desire it with the Signs of Barrenness and how long a  Man  or  VVoman  are capable of having  Children    THAT Marriage is an Honourable State ordain'd by God in Paradice and since confirm'd by our Blessed Saviour who wrought his first Miracle at a Wedding I hope no Body will deny Therefore it is convenient that PARENTS will take care of their Daughters Chastity  and when they find them  inclinable  to Marriage not violently to restrain their Affections but rather to provide for them if possible such Husbands as may be for their Advantage and with whom they may live comfortably in that blessed State lest being crossed in their Purposes and delayed they part with their Honour dishonourable ways  The propension and inclination of  Maids  to Marriage is to be discovered by many Symptoms For when they arrive to Maturity which is usually about the th or th Year of their Age according to their respective Habits or Constitutions then their  Menses  or Natural Purgations begin to flow and the  Blood  which is no longer taken to augment their Bodies abounding incites their Minds and Imaginations to Venery External Causes also may promote and excite them to it for the Spirits being  brisk  and in a manner  inflamed  â–ª when they arrive at this Age if they eat  salt sharp Things Spices c  whereby the Body becomes  still more and more heated  then the  Inclination  and  Proneness  to  Venerial Embraces  is very great nay sometimes almost inseparable And a due use of these Enjoyments being denied to Virgins very often produces very  dismal Effects  as green and WeaselColour short Breathings Tremblings of the    c  But if they happen  to be married to their own Content those Afflictions vanish and their Native Beauty returns more gay than before Nor is their eager gazing and desiring to associate themselves with Men a less Sign that Nature  prompts them  to desire  what she ordained  their due of which being sometimes by obdurate Parents debarr'd in a lawful Way they break the Bounds of Modesty rather than endure such violent Agitations and Conflicts  within themselves  and so satiate their Desires in unlawful Love The same may in all particulars be observed in young brisk Widows whom Death that Enemy of sweet conjugal Love has separated from the Bosom of their Husbands  At Years of Age commonly the  Menses  in Virgins begin to flow and their they are capable of conceiving and so contitinue generally to Fortyfour at what time for the most part they are no longer capable of Generation unless such as are exceeding healthful strong of Body and have used themselves to Temperance who have appeared to be delivered of Children till Years but such Prodigies rarely happen altho' the  Menses  continue longer in some Women than in others but many times such Efflux proceeds not from any natural cause but by reason of some violent Straining or other Violence and doth often endanger  the Life of the Party And therefore  Young Men  that marry  Women  surmounting the Age aforesaid if they expect Children unless by Miracle must labour against the Wind Though if an  Old Man  that is not worn out by Diseases and Incontinency marry a brisk lively Lass there is hopes even to Threescore and Ten and some that are extraordinary lusty till Fourscore  Hypocrates  that Famous and Learned Physician is of Opinion that a  Youth  at Years or between that and having much Vital Strength may be capable of getting Children and that Force and Heat of procreating Matter continually increases till and And at the end of the latter begins to flag the Seed by little and little becoming unfruitful the natural Spirits being extinguished and the Humours dried up and in general most Physicians to this day do observe it but as to particulars as I have before mentioned it often hapneth otherwise nay 'tis reported by a credible Author that in the Reign of  Ere  us  King of  Swedeland  a Man was married at an Hundred Years old to a Bride of Thirty and had many Children by her but looked so fresh that such as knew him not took him not to exceed that Age  In  Campania  where the Air is temperate serene and calm  Men  of Year usually  marry  Young Virgins  and have Children by them which argues that Age in  Men  hinders not Procreation unless they be exhausted in their Youth and their Members shrivelled up If any ask why a  Woman  is sooner barren than a  Man I answer  The Cause is the natural Heat which is more predominant in the latter than in the former For since a  Woman  is more moist than a Man as her Monthly Purgations do most evidently demonstrate as also the softness of her Body 'tis also apparent that he doth exceed her in native Heat and as for that Heat it is the chief thing that concocts the Humours into good and proper Aliment which the  Woman  wanting grows fat when a  Man  by reason of that Heat melts his Fat by Degrees and his Humours are dissolved and by the Benefit thereof they are elaborated into Seed And this may for the better confirmation of what I propose be added That the  Woman  generally is not so strong as a  Man  nor so wise and ingenious in contriving her Affairs whereby the Faculties are hinder'd in their Operation And so I conclude my Assertion  CHAP II General and Particular Rules laid down by Learned Physiciansâ–ª how to proceed in getting a Male or Female Child and of the  Embryo  and perfect Birth and the fittest Season for Copulation  WHEN a young likely Couple have entered the holy State of Wedlock and are desirous of mutual Enjoyment for Generationsake which is the chief end for which Wedlock was ordained and rather covet to be bless'd with one Sex than another let them know fitst for certain that the success of  such things  depends upon Divine Providence tho' secondary Causes must be  active  and  instrumental  therein and those are especially two  First  The  Genital Humour  which is brought by the  Arteriae Praeparantes  to the  Testes  in the Form of Blood and there elaborated into Seed by the  Seminifical Faculty  resident in them To which may be added the Appetite and Desire to Copulation which fires the Imagination with unusual Fancies or by the sight of a brisk charming Beauty whose Wit and Liveliness may much intice and more inflame the Courage But if Nature be enfeebled then are there fit Artificial Remedies to restore it  viz  Such Meats as most  conduce to the affording such Aliment as proves to make Seed abound and restore the Decays of Nature that the Faculties may freely operate For as dung and good muturing restores Ground that is worn out and heartless even so seasonable and proper Diet operates to the restoring the faint Heart weak Spirit coldness and driness of the Genital parts and reduceth the weakness of the Nerves to their Temperament and removes Impediments obstructing the Procreation of Children Then since Diet may and will after the evil state of the Body to a better it is necessary that such as are subject to Barrenness should eat such Meats only as tend to render them fruitful and among such things as are inducing and stirring up thereto are all Meats of good Juice that nourish well and make the Body lively and full of Sap of which faculty are all hot moist Meats for according to  Galen  the substance of Seed is made of the pure concocted and windy superfluity of Blood from whence we may conclude there is in many things a power to accumulate or heap up Seed as also to augment it and other things of force to cause Erection as HenEggs Pheasants Woodcocks Gnatsappers Thrushes Blackbirds young Pidgeons Sparrows Patridges Capons Almonds PineNuts Raysons Currants all strong Wines  moderately taken especially those made of the Grapes of  Italy  but Erection is chiefly caused and provoked by  Styrium Eringoes Cresses Erysimum Parsnip  Artichoaks Turnips Rapes Asparagus Candy'd Ginger Gallinga Acorns  bruised to Powder and drank in  Muscadine Scallions SeaShellFish  c All these tho' excellent Restoratives will not have present Operation but you must use yourself to them for a considerable time or else you will reap little or no benent by them The Act of  Coition  being over  wheren the force of Imagination is certainly very prevalent in the causing of the Child to be of this or that Sex  the Woman say the  Antients  must gently repose on her Right Side with her Head lying low and her Body sinking down that by sleeping in that posture the  Cell  on the Right Side of the  Matrix  may prove the  Place of Conception  in which is the greatest force of Generative Heat which is the chief Inducement to the Procreation of  Male  Children and rarely fails to answer the expectation of those that experience it especially if they keep themselves warm and without much Motion leaning for the most part to the Right and drinking a little of  Spirit of Saffron and Juice of Hysop  in a  Glass of Mallaga  or  Aligant  when they lie down and rise for the space of a Week Now the fittest time they say  for the Procreation of  Male Children  is when the  Sun  is in  Leo  and the  Moon  's in  Virgo Scorpio  or  Sagittarius    This Order they will also have observed for a  Female Child  by lying as aforesaid on the left side and strongly fancying a  Female  in the time of Procreation especially if the  Woman  drink the  Decoction  of  Female Mercury  days from the st day of Purgation the  Male Mercury  both Herbs so called having the like Operation in case of a  Male Child  for the Juice or Decoction of those Simples are of Force the  one  to purge the  Right  and the  other  the  Left Side  of the  Womb  and thereby open the  Receptacles  making way for the Seminary of Generation And the best time to  copulate  for this Sex is when the  Moon  is in the  wane  and the sign in  Libra  or  Aquarius  for  then  they will be of a most gentle affable temper very fair and perfect in all their members  Avicenna  an Author of good repute describes the  time  of  Procreation  thus  When  saith he  the Menses are spent and the Womb is cleansed which is commonly    days or    at most if a man lie with his wife from the first day she is purged to the fifth she will conceive a Male but from the fifth to the eight a Female and from the eighth to the twelfth a Male again But after that number of days perhaps neither distinctly but both in an  Hermophradite  In a word They that would be commended to their Wedlock Actions and be happy in the fruit of their Labour must observe to copulate at distance of time not too often nor yet too seldom for  both these  hurt Fruitfulness alike for to eject immoderately weakens a  Man  and wasts his Spirits and  too often  causes the Seed by long continuance to be ineffectual and not Manly enough And thus much for the first general and particular from whence I shall proceed to the second which is to give the Reader to understand  how  the  Child  is formed in the  Womb  and what Accidents it is incident to  how  nourished and  how  brought forth  Certain it is there are various Opinions concerning this matter therefore I shall for the satisfaction of the curious lay down the Opinion of the Learned as thus Man consists of an  Ovum  or  Eg  impregnated in the  Ovaria  or  Testieles  of the  Woman  by the more subtile part of  Man  's Seed but there is a forming Faculty and  Virtue  in the  Seed  from a Divine and Heavenly Gift it being abundantly endued with Vital and Etherial Spirit which gives Shape and Form to the  Embryo  so that all the parts and bulk of the Body which is made up in the space of many months and is by Degrees fram'd and form'd into a decent and comely Figure of a Man do consist in that and are adumbrated  thereby On which holy  David  contemplating fell into his Divine Rapture and Admiration expressed in  Psal    I will praise theeâ–ª O Lord because I am wonderfully made Thy Works are wonderful My Soul searcheth and knoweth it right well Thou knowest all my Bones when I was Fashioned in the secret place and when I was wonderfully formed in my Mother's Womb Thy Eyes beheld me yet unmade and in thy Book were all my Members written which day by day were fashioned Thy Knowledge is wonderful unto me whereby I was made I cannot understand it  c And Physicians that have narrowly contemplated Man's Nature constitute four different Times wherein this Microsm or little World is framed and perfected in the Womb  The first is immediately after Coition and is said to be perfected in the first Week if no Efflux happen which sometimes fall out through the slipperiness of the Matrix or the Head thereof that shifts over like a Rosebud opening on a sudden by reason of some cold Distemper or overweariness in Travel  The second time of forming is constituted when Nature and the force of the Womb by the use of her own imbred Forces and Virtue makes a manifest Mutation in the Conception so that all the Substance seems Congealed Flesh and Blood which  happens about the Twelfth and Fourteenth day after Copulation and though this Concreation or Fleshly Mass abound with hot fiery Blood yet it remains undistinguishable without form of Figure and may be called the rough Draught or  Embrio  and well likened to Seed which is sown in the Ground which through kindly Heat and Moisture grows up by degrees into a perfect Form either in Plant or Grain or as when a  Potter  Fashons a Vessel out of a rude lump of Clay  The third time to make up this Fabrick is set when the principle Parts shew themselves evidently and perspiciously as the Heart from whence proceeds the Arteries the Brain from which the Nerves proceed like many small Threads running through the whole Body and the Liver whose Office it is to seperate the Bile from the Blood brought to it by the  Vana Portae  The two first are the Seeds and Fountains of Life that nourish and support each part of the Body in framing which the Faculty of the Womb is busied from the time of Conception to the Eighteenth Day of the first Month  But Lastly which time reacheth to the or th day the outward parts are seen exquisitely elabourted and distinguished by Joints and then the Child begins to grow  and pant from which progress of days by reason the Limbs are divided and the whole frame is perfect it is no longer held an imperfect Child or  Embrio  that is a  Concretion  that springs forth but is held to be a perfect and absolute  Child Males  for the most part are perfect by the th day but  Females  seldom till the or day and the reason why the one is sooner perfected than the other is That the heat of the Womb is greater in producing the  Male  than the  Female  For heat extends the Humour like soft Wax diffusing and dilating it and then by its force Contracting Framing and Fashoning it so Heat and Vigour of the Body and Alacrity of Nature in the Man makes the  Male  to move in Months but the Female rarely under at which time also his Hair and Nails comes forth and the Child begins to stir kick and tumble in the Womb so that the motion is plainly perceived and the Woman are troubled with  Nauseating  and  Loathing  of their Meat and oftentimes covet and greedily long for things contrary to Nutriment as Coals Rubbish Chalk Lime Starch Oatmeal raw Flesh and Fish or the like which Desire proceeds from a former contraction of evil Humours occasioning impure Blood in their contained Vessel within and often occasions Abortion and Miscarriages some  Women as it has been noted by divers Authors of Credit have been so extravagent in their Longings that they have coveted HobNails Leather Man's Flesh HorseFlesh and the Flesh of divers Ravenous Beasts for want of which they have cast their Birth untimely or the Child has continued Dead in the Womb for many days to the eminent hazard of the Woman's Life But to proceed in this great Mystery I shall unfold by what means the Infant is sustain'd in the Womb and what posture it there remains in  The Disputes among both Philosophers and Physicians with what and by what way the  Faetus  is nourished have been very great some affirming by Blood only from the  Vmbilical  Vein others only by Chyle received in by the Month but the Truth is it is nourished diversly according to the different degrees of Perfection that an  Ovum  or Egg passes from a Conception to a  Faetus  ready for the Birth  But before we proceed it will not be amiss to explain what we mean by this  Ovum  or Egg You must know then that there are in the Generation of the  Faetus  two Principles Active and Passive The Active is the Man's Seed which is elaborated in the Testicles out of the Arterial Blood and Animal Spirits The Passive  Principle is an  Ovum  or Egg impregnated by the Man's Seed For to say that Woman has true Seed is false and erroneous But the manner of Conception is thus The most Spirituous part of Man's Seed in the Act of Generation reaching up to the  Ovarium  or Testicles of the Woman which contain divers Eggs sometimes more sometimes fewer secundates one of them which being convey'd by the  Oviducts  to the bottom of the Womb presently begins to swell bigger and bigger and imbibes the moisture that is sent plentifully thither after the same manner that Seeds in the ground suck the fertile moisture thereof to make them sprout  When the parts of the  Embryo  begin to be a little more perfect and the  Chorion  becomes so thick that the Liquor cannot soak through it the  Vmbilical  Vessels begin to be formed and to extend the side of the  Amnios  which they pass through and also through the  Allantides  and  Chorion  and are implanted in the  Placenta  which gathering upon the  Chorion  joyns into the  Vterus  And now the Arteries that before sent out the nutritious juice into the  Cavity  of the Womb open by the Orifices into the  Placenta  where they deposite the said Juice which is drunk up by the  Vmbilical Vein  and conveyed by it first to the Liver  of the  Foetus  and then to the Heart where its more thin and spirituous part is turned into Blood whilst the grosser part of it descending by the  Aorta  enters the  Vmbilical Arteries  and is discharged into its Cavity by those Branches of them that run through the  Amnios    Assoon as the  Mouth Stomach  and  Gullet c  are formed so perfecty that th  Faetus  can swallow it sucks in some of the grosser  Nutritious Juice  that is deposited in the  Amnios  by the  Vmbilical Arteries  â–ª which descending into the Stomach and Intestines is received by the  Lacteal  as in  Adust Persons    The  Faetus  being perfected at the times before specified in all its parts it lies equally ballanced in the midst of the Womb as in the Center all on a Head and being something long is turned round so that the Head a little inclines and it lays his Chin on its Breast his Heels and Ancles upon its Buttocks its Hands on its Cheeksâ–ª and its Thumbs to its Eyes but its Legs and Thighs are carried upwards with its Hams bending so that they touch the bottom of its Belly the former and that part of the Body which is over against us as the Forehead Nose Face are turned towards the Mother's Back and the Head inclining downwards towards the Cocyx or Rumpbone  that joins to the  OsÂ· Sacrum  which bone together with  Os Pubis  in the time of the Birth part and are loosned whence  t is that Male Children commonly come with their Faces downwards or with their Heads turned somewhat  Oblique  that their Faces may be seen but the Famale Children with their Faces upwards tho' some  imes it happens that Births follow not ac  ording to Nature's Order but Children  ome forth with their Feet straddling their Necks bowed and their Heads lying  Oblique  with their Hand stretch'd out which great  y endangers themselves and the Mother  iving the Midwife great Trouble to intro  uce them into the World but when all  hings proceed orderly and naturally the Child when Nature's set Bounds are accomplished is desirous to break its bounds and come forth of the Womb and by inclining himself he rowls downward for he cannot longer be obscured in those hidingplaces and the heat of the Heart can't subsist without external respiration wherefore being grown great he is more and more desirous of Nutriment and Light when coveting the Etherial Airâ–ª he by strugglig to obtain it breaks the Membranes and Coverings whereby he was restrained and fenced against Attrition and for the most part with bitter pangs of the Mother  issueth forth to view the Days commonly in the ninth Month for then the Matrix divided and the  Os Pubis  being loosnedâ–ª the Woman strives what she can to cast forth her Burthen and the Child doing the like to get forth by the help of its inbred strength the Birth comes to be perfectâ–ª but if the Child be dead the more dangerous is the Delivery tho' Nature as a kind Commiserator often helpeth the Women's Weakness herein But the Child that is quick and lively labours no less than the Woman  Now these are Births at Seven or Eight Months and some Women go to the Tenth Month But of these and the Reason of them I shall speak more largely in another place and at present proceed to unravel other Mysteries of Nature  CHAP III  Reason why Children are often like their Parents and what the Mothers Imagination contributes thereto whence grows the Kind  viz  whether the Man or Woman is the Cause of the Male or Female Child  c  THat if a Woman in the Act of Copulation affords most Seed her Likeness will  ve the greater Impression upon the Child  if on the contrary then will follow the  ntrary effects or if a proportionable  uantity proceed from either then will  Similitude depend upon neither  Lactantius  is of Opinion That when a  an's Seed  falls on the  left side  of the  Womb  Male Child may be gotten but by rea  n it is the proper place for a Female there  ill be something in it greatly resembling  Woman  viz  It will be fairer whiter and smoother nor very subject to have Hair on the Body or Chin long lank Hair on the Head Voice small and sharp and the courage feeble and arguing yet further he says that a Female may perchance  procreated if the Seed fall on the right  de but then thro' extraordinary Heat  will be very large boned full of Courage  endued with a Big Voice and hav  her Chin and Bosom hairy not being  clear as other of the Sex subject to qua  rel with her Husband when married fo  the Superiority  c  In case of the Similitude nothing is more powerful than th  Imagination of the Mother for if she con  ceive in her Mind or do by Chance faste  her Eyes upon any Object and imprint it i  her Memory the  Child  in its  outward par  frequently has some representation the  of so whilst a Man and Woman are in th  Act of Copulation if the Woman earnestl  behold his Countenance and fix her Mind thereon without all peradventure th  Child will resemble the Father nay so powerful is its operation that though  Woman be in unlawful Copulation yet  Fear or any thing else causes her to fix he  Mind upon her Husband the Child wi  resemble him tho he never got it Th  same effect according to the  Opinion  of th  Learned Proceeds from Imagination i  cause of Warts Moldspots Stains Dashes and the Figures of strange things tho' in  deed they sometimes happen thro' Fright  or extravagant Longing Many Wome  there are that seeing a Hare cross them when great with Child will through th  strength of  Imagination  bring forth a Child with a hairy Lip Some Children again ar  orn with flat Noses wry Mouths great  lubber lips and illshap'd Bodies and most scribe the reason to the strange conceit of  he  Mother  who has busied her Eyes and Mind upon some illshaped or distorted Creatures therefore it properly behoves all Women with Child to avoid any mon  trous Sight or at least to have a steadfast Mind not easily fixed upon any thing more than another And this Opinion  Pliny  onfirms in his th Book of natural things  nd the  th  Chapter The famous Sir  Thomas More  likewise confirms it and discants merrily on a Passage of his times wherein  Person having divers Children would own none but what was like him when  n the end it was proved by the  ass  veration  of the Mother that all except that were of  is own begetting but whilst another Man was mounted in his Saddle she fear  ng that he would come and detect her in  he Act had her Imagination so fixed on him that as she conceived the similitude  ould proceed from no other cause wherefore it is apparent that likeness can confirm  o Child to be a lawful Father's own Yet  Manners Wit and Apprehension of the Mind daily Examples teach us that Children are commonly of the same Condition with their Progenitors and of the same na  ure but there is much in this whether  Venery be used with great or weak  for many are less inclined to it and not  hot and consequently not so desirous  Copulation but rather decline it unle  Civility to their Wives cause them to co  pliance therein and then they proceed fain  ing and drowsily whence it happens th  the Children fall short of their Parent's N  ture Wit and Manners and hence it is th  wise Men frequently beget stupid slothf  Children of  eeble Minds because they ar  not much given to those Delights But  I said on the contrary when the Progen  tors are hot in Venerious Actions and d  liberally and abundantly employ themselve  therein it oftentimes happens that th  Children are of the same Desires Manner  and Actions of the Mind with their Parents And thus much for the first Point now  shall proceed to the second which is  shew what share each of the Parents hav  in begetting the Child  c  And first we wi  give the Opinion of the Ancients about it  Though it is apparent say they tha  the Seed of Man is the chief efficient and beginning of Action Motion and Gene  ration yet that the Woman does afford Seed and effectually contributes in tha  particular to the Procreation of the Child i  evinced by strong Reasons In the fir  place Seminary Vessels had been give  them in vain and genital Testicles interverted if the  Woman  wanted  Seminal Excressence  for being Nature doth nothing in vain therefore it must be granted that they were made for the Use of Seed and Procreation and fixed in their proper Places both the Testicles and Receptacles of Seed whose nature and force is to operate and afford fruitful virtue to the Seed and to prove this there needs no stronger Argument say they than that if a Woman do not use Copulation to eject her Seed she oftentimes falls into strange Diseases as appears by young Widows and Virgins A second Reason they urge That although the Society of a  lawful Bed  consist not altogether in these things yet it is apparent that the Female Sex is not better won and appear more blithe and jocund than when they are often satisfied this way which is an inducement to believe that they have  greater  Pleasure and receive more Content than a Man For since by Nature much Delight accompanies Ejection by the breaking forth of the swelling Spirit and the stiffness of the Nerves in which case the Operation of the Woman's Part is double she suffering both ways even by  Ejection  and  Reception  whereby she is more recreated and delighted in the  Venereal Act    Hence it is they say that the Child  more frequently resembles the  Mother  than the Father because the  Mother  confers the most towards its Generation And they think it may be further instanced from the great love they bear them for that besides their contributing  Seminal Matter  they during the time they are in the  Womb  â–ª feed and nourish the  Child  with the  purest Fountain of Blood  which Opinion  Galen  confirms by allowing the Child to participate more of the  Mother  than the Father and refers the Difference of the Sex to the Influence of Menstrual Blood but the Reason of the Likeness he attributes to the Force of the Seed for as Plants receive more from fruitful Ground than from the Industry of the Husbandman so the Infant in more abundance receives from the  Mother  than the Father for first the Seed of both is heaped and fostered in the Womb and there grows to perfection being nourished with Blood And hence they will have it that  Children  for the most part  affect  their  Mother  best for it proceeds from the nearness of Nature by a natural Instinct because the  Mothers  force was most employed about 'em For Months and sometimes she nourisheth the Child with her purest Blood then her love towards it newly born and the Likeness do clearly demonstrate that the Woman  affordeth Seed and that Women do contribute more towards making the Child than Men But in all this the  Antients  were very much in an Error for the Testicles so called in Womem do not afford any Seed but are two Eggs analogous to those of Fowls and other Creatures neither have they any such Office as those of Men but are indeed  Ovarium  wherein those Eggs are nourished by the sanguinary Vessels dispersed through them and from whence one or more as they are fecundated by the Man's Seed separated and are conveyed into the Womb by the  Ovi duces  The Truth of this is plain for if you boile them their liquor will have the same colour taste and consistency with the Whites of Birds Eggs to say they want shells is nothing at all for the Eggs of Fowls while they are in the  Ovary  nay after they have fallen down into the  Vterus  have no Shell And though when they are laid they have one yet that is no more than a Fence which Nature has provided them against outward Injuries while they are hatched without the Body whereas those of Women being hatced within the Body need no other Fence than the Womb by which they are sufficiently guarded  And thus much for the clearing of this Point also and now to the third thing proposed  viz  Whence grows the Kind and whether the Man or the Woman is the Cause of the Male or Female Infant  The primal Cause as justly due in this and all other Cases we must ascribe to God the Ruler and Disposer of all things yet many things by his high Sufferance proceed in regular order by the Rules of Nature and are carried on by their inbred  Motion  according to their usual and natural Course without Variation tho' indeed by favour from on high  Sarah  conceived  Isaac Hannah Samuel  and  Elizabeth John  the  Baptist  but these were to fulfil the Almighty's Decree nor since those times have the Prayers of the righteous been unsuccessful in obtaining Children but passing over such Supernatural and Extraordinary Causes that have their peculiar Effects I shall proceed to speak of things natural and common The Antient Physitians and Philosophers say That since there are two Principles out of which the Body of Man is made and which render the Child like the Progenitors and to be of one or the other Sex  viz  Seed common to both Sexes and menstrual Blood proper to the Woman only The Similitude say they must needs consist in the Force of the Male or Female Seed so that it proves like to the one or the other as  more or less Plenty is afforded by either but that the difference of Sex is not referr'd to the Seed but to the Menstrual Blood which is proper to the Woman for were that force say they altogether retained in the Seed the Man's Seed being of a hotter quality than the Woman's Male Children would be superabundant and none of the other Sex or very rarely would be propagated whereof the kind of the Creature is attributed to the Temperament of the  active qualities  which consist in Heat and cold and to the substances or nature of the Matter under them that is to the flowing of the Menstrual Blood Now the Seed say they affords both Force to procreate and form the Child and Matter for its Generation and that in the menstrual Blood there is both Matter and Force for as the Seeds most helps the material Principles so likewise the menstrual Blood the potential Seed is saith  Galen  Blood well concocted by the Vessels that contain it so that Blood is not only the Matter of generating the Child but also Seed in possibility that Menstrual Blood hath both Principles as Matter and Faculty of offering The  Ancients  say further That the Seed is not the strongest Effi  ent the Matter of it being very little in quantity but that the potential or efficient Faculty of it is very feeble  Wherefore if the material part or Prin+ciple of Generation according to which the Sex is made were only say they in the menstrual Blood then would the Children be all or mostly Females as if the efficient force was in the Seed they would be all Males but that since both have Operation in menstrual Blood Matter predominates in quantity and in the Seeds Force and Virtue Deservedly saith  Galen  the Child receives its Sex rather from the Mother than from the Father although his Seed do contribute something to the material Principles though more weakly But as for Similitude although Imagination say the  Antients  be of extraordinary Force it is referred rather to the Father than the Mother as to the Quality of the Seed at or for a short time after Copulation but continues not long so to do for that the Woman's Seed receiving Faculty from the menstrual Blood for the space of Nine Months overpowers the Man's as to that Particular because the menstrual Blood flowing into the Vessels rather cherishes and augments the one than the other from which it may be more easily conjectur  d that the Woman not only affords Matter to make the Child but Force and Virtue to perfect the Conception though the Woman's Seed be fit Nutriment  for the Man's by Reason of the moisture and thinness of it being more fit to frame and make up Conception thereby for as with soft Wax and moist Clay the Workman can frame what he intends so say they the Man's Seed mixing with the Woman's as also with the Menstrual Blood helps effectually to make the form and perfect Part of Man but with all the Respect and Difference imaginable to the Wisdom of the  Ancients  we must needs say that their Ignorance in Anatomy has led them into many and great mistakes and their  Hypothesis  of the Formation of the  Embryo  from a Commixture of Seeds and the Nutrition of it from the menstruous Blood being altogether false their Opinion in this Case must needs be false also  Therefore to conclude this Chapter we say  That although a strong Imagination of the Mother may sometimes determine the Sex that is make it Male or Female according as her Imagination is yet the main Agent in this Case is the Plastick or Formative Principle which is the Efficient in Forming the Child that gives it this or that Sex according to those Laws and Rules that are prescribed to it by the wise Creator of all things    CHAP IV A serious Discourse of the Soul of Man That it is not propagated from the Parents but is infused by God and can neither die nor corrupt and what day of Childbearing it is infused Of the Immortality thereof and Certainty of its Resurrection  THE Soul of Man is of so Divine a Nature and Excellency that Man himself cannot any wise comprehend it it being the infused breath of t  e Almighty Immortal and Incomprehensible but by him that gave it it being as it well may be termed a part of himself for  Moses  by holy Inspiration relating the O  ginal of Man tells us that  God had breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life and be  me a living Soul  Now as for all other Creatures at his word they were made and had Life but the Creature that God hath appointed to set over his works was favoured with the more immediate hand of the Almighty forming him out of the Dust of the Earth and secondly condescending to breath into his Nostr  ls the Breath of Life which implies that there was more care and if we may so te  m it labour used about Man than about all other Creatur  on c  ated things he only partaking and participating with  the Divine Nature being made in his likeness bearing the Image of God that is in Innocence and Purity whilst he stood firm but in his Fall that lively Image was defaced yet such was the Infinite love of God towards him that altho' he Rebelled against him he would not altogether cast him off but found a way to restore him Nay so much in esteem was he thought not deserving the least favour that the Son of God the second Person in the Glorious Trinity when the fulness of Time was come laying aside his Crown of Stars left the Right hand of Glory Majesty and the bright effulgence that adorned him and descending took upon him our Nature O infinite and unspeakable Love Nay more endured Shame Reproach Scourging Buffetting Sp  ting on and the Death of the Cross that he might bruise the Head of the Serp  nt and deliver the beloved Man from the Jaws and Brink of utte  Ruin And the better to con  irm his love towards us is ascended on high leading Captivity Captive where he is so far from forgetting us that he is become our Mediato  and makes daily Intercession for us to the Father whose offend  d J  stice he has sati  ed as to the Original Sin But to come nearer to my purpose  If Man would understand the Excellency of the Soul for as it is capable of comprehending it self let him after serious Recollection descend into himself and search diligently his own Mind and there he shall find so many admirable Gifts and excellent Ornaments that it must needs strike him with  Wonder  and  Amaz ment  as  Reason Vnderstanding  true  Choice Ability of Wit Memory  and divers other Faculties that absolutely approve the Soul to be more admirable than that any should imagine it be finite or subject to Annihilation yet by Reason of its many Offices and Operations whilst in the Body it is specified under sundry  denominations  For as S  Augustine  saith when it enlivens the Body it is called the  Soul  when it gives it Knowledge the  Judgment  the  Mind  when it recalls things past the  Memory  whilst it discourseth and discerneth  Reason  whilst it contemplates the  Spirits  whilst it is in the sensitive Parts the  Senses  and as these are the principal Offices whereby the  Soul  declares its  Power  and performs it  Actions  for placed in the highest Part of the Body and the nearest Heaven it difuseth or disperseth effectually its Force into every Member not propagated from the Parents nor mixed with gross Matter but the infused Breath of  the Almighty immediatly proceeding from him nor passing from one to another as fondly and absurdly the  Pythagoreans  have insinuated in their Opinions about the Transmigration of the Soul and so vain were they that they did not only imagine the Souls of the deceased Men passed into newborn Infants but into Beasts also and from thence it was they forbid the eating of Flesh and abstained themselves from so doing lest as they fondly fansied they might as  Tertullian  records it eat their Grandfather in a Calf But such frivolous and superstitious Notions are to be rejected by Christians and those true ones observed which are both reasonable and agreeable to humane Capacities For  Orthodox Divines  conclude in general that the Soul is given to any Infant by Infusion when he or she is perfected in the Womb which happens about the th Day after Conception especially for Males that in likelyhood will be born at the end of Nine Months but in Femals who are of a weaker Constitution and not so soon formed and be perfected thro' the defect of Heat not till the th Day  And altho this Day in all cases cannot be  perfectly  set down yet  Hypocrates  has undertaken to give his absolute Opinion when the Child has its perfect form whom  it begins to move and when born if in due Season for in his Book of the Nature of Infants he affirmeth That if it be a Male and he be perfect on the thirtieth day and move at the sixtieth he will come forth at the Seventh Month but if he be perfectly formed on the  th  day he will move on the  th  and be born in the  th Month  Again if he be perfectly formed on the  th  day he will move on the  th  day and be born in the  Ninth Month  Now from these passing of Days and  Months  it plainly appears that the day of Forming being doubled makes up the day of moving and that day three times reckoned makes up the day of Birth  As for Example where perfect the Form if you double it it makes the day of Motion and three times amounts to Days or Months allowing Days to one Month and so you must consider the rest But as for the Female it is longer perfecting in the Womb and the  Mother  ever goes longer with a Boy than a Girl so that there is difference in the Accompt for a Female formed in Days moves not till the day and is born in the Month when she is formed in the day she moves not till the day and is born in the Month but if she be perfectly formed on the Day she moves on the and  is born in the  th month  but she that is formed on the  th day  moves on the  th day  then will she be born in the  th month  And thus I have more largely demonstrated it to the  Reader  that he may know the reasonable Soul is not propagated by the Parents but is infused by God when the Child hath its perfect Form and is exactly distinguished in its Lineaments  Now as the Life of every other Creature as it is testified in the  th  Chap of  Leviticus  is in the Blood so the life of Man consisteth in the Soul the which although subject to Passion by Reason of the gross Composure of the Body in which it has a temporary Confinement yet it is immortal and cannot in it self corrupt or suffer change it being a spa  of the Divine mind and a bla  of Almighty Breath that distinguishes Man from other Creatures and renders him Immo  al and that every Man has a peculiar Soul it plainly appears by the vast difference between the Wit Judgment Opinion Manners Affections  c  in Men And this  David  observes when he says  God hath in particular fa  oned the Hearts and Minds of all Men and has given to every one its own being and a Soul of its own Nature  Hence  Solomon  rejoyced that God had given him a happy Soul and Body agreeable and suitable to it  It has caused many Disputes amongst the Learned especially Philosophers in what part of the Body the Soul chuses to reside and some have given their Opinion that its Residence is in the middle of the Heart and from thence communicates its self to every Part which  Solomon  in the Fourth of his Proverbs seems to assert when he says  Keep thy Heart with all thy Diligence because Life proceedeth therefrom  but many curious Physicians searching the Works of Nature in Man's Anatomy  c  do give their Opinion That its chief Seat is in the Brain from whence proceed the Senses Faculties and Actions diffusing the Operation of the Soul through all Parts of the Body whereby it is enlivened with Heat and Force but it doth communicate particular Force to the Heart by Arteries Carotides or sleepy Arteries that part upon the Throat the which if they happen to be broke or cut cause Barrenness and if stopped an Apoplexy for there must necessarily be some Ways thro' which the Spirits Animal and Vital may have intercourse and convey Native Heat from the Soul For although the Soul is said to reside in one place it operates in every part exercising every Member which are the Souls Instruments by which she manifesteth her Power but  if it so happen that any of the Original Parts are out of Tune the Work is confused as it may appear in case of Idiots Madmen  c  Though in some of them the Soul by forcibly working recovers her  supernatural Vigour  and they become right after a long Despondency of Mind and in some it is lost in this Life For as Fire under Ashes or the Sun obscured from our sight by thick Clouds afford not their full Lustre so the Soul overwhelmed in moist or faulty Matter is darkned and Reason thereby overclouded and altho' Reason shines less in Children than in those that are arrived to maturity yet no man must imagine that the Soul is an Infant and grows up with the Child for then would it again decay but it suits it self to the Weakness of Nature and the Imbecility of Body wherein it is placed that it may the better operate And as the Body is more and more capable of receiving its Influence so it shews it self in its proper Lustre having force and endowments at the time it enters the former Child in the Womb for the substance of it can receive nothing less and thus much to prove that the Soul comes not from the Parents but is infused by God And the next thing now to be handled is its Immortality and thereby I shall demonstrate the certainty of its Resurrection  That the Soul of Man is a Divine Ray infu  d by God I have already made apparent and now come to shew you that whatever immediately proceeds from him must participate of his Nature and from thence consequently be as immortal as the Original for although all other Creatures are indued with Life and Motion yet want they a reasonable Soul and from thence 'tis concluded that Life is in their Blood and that being corruptible they perish and after expiring are no more But Man being indued with a reasonable Soul and stamped with the Divine Image is of a different Nature and though his Body be corruptible yet his Soul cannot perish but must when it is expelled its Earthly Tabernacle return to God that gave it either to receive reward or punishment now that the Body can sin of it self is impossible because wanting the Soul it cannot act nor Proceed to any thing either good or evil for could it do so additional Sins might be accumulated even in the Grave but 'tis plain that after Death there is a Cessation  for as death leaves us so Judgment finds us  And St  John  in the Fifth Chapter of his Gospel tells us  That the hour shall come that all that are in the Grave shall hear his Voice and they that have done well shall com forth to the Resurrection of Life and they that have  done evil to the Resurrection of Condemnation  And Holy  Job  in the and Chapter speaking to the same Purpose  says  For I know that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth And though after  Skin Worms destroy this Body  et in my Flesh shall I see God when I shall see  or my self and mine Eyes shall behold and not  ther though my Reins be consumed within    By this 'tis plainly proved that the Soul is made of Immortal Essence incapable of Death having a place assigned it after its separation from the Body t  ll the day of the general Resurrection not in the  rave in a Mansion prepared by the Almighty for its Reception and that through the mightyworking of him that is able to subdue all things to himself it shall  gain enter the same Body that was laid  own tho' the dust thereof be scattered to  four Winds of Heaven nay such force  vigour shall it have that it shall as  were take up the Body for  Job  posi  vely says  I shall rise out of the Earth at the  day  c Which being applicable to  future Tense may be meant two ways  shall or will arise plainly foreseeing  Resurrection he claimed it as the Pro  ise of his Creator Nay so far were the  eathens by the light of Nature from  ubting the Immortality of the Soul that  Plato  in his  Phaedo  thus reasons  viz What consists out of Elements  says he  is Immortal and can never die The Soul is not made of Elements nor of created matter but came from God and therefore it cannot dye  c Then may it be without difficulty granted that the Body which has been a long Companion of the Souls will once again enjoy it never more to be separated for the Body at the Resurrection shall be incorruptible and so as far from a capacity of perishing any more than the Soul made so by him that first created it For St  Paul  speaking of the Resurrection saith  He shall change our vile Bodies and make them like his glorious Body  The Consideration of which make  him in another place cry out  O the depth of the Riches of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God How unsearchable are his Judgments and his ways past finding out For who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath  his Counsellor For by him and through  and to him are all things  Nay the Resurrection of a Man's Body may be proved by the renewing of many inconsiderable Creatures and their returning to Life after they seem dead nay some of them thereby also changed as who hath not observed that when a Grashopper is grown old and hath cast his Skin a lively new shrill Insect will come forth of it From a dying and  uggish Caterpiller comes out a lively  ainted Butterfly From Ants a winged  ly The Silkworm having spent her  owels in weaving out her web after ma  y days seeming dead and motionless be  omes a Butterfly proving for increase  laying a number of Eggs and then ex  ires But above all the  Phaenex  that  Learned  Lactantius  writes of may put  in mind if not confirm to us the Re  urrection for after she has lived in the  Arabian  Fields as some affirm about  ears and finding her self wasted with  ge and infirmity she gathers the Sprigs  f  Cassi  Myrrh Frankincense and other  romatick Combustables when labouring  ith her wings she firing them by the  eat of the Sun which in those Countries  excessive she expires upon the Funeral  ile when out of her Ashes springs a  orm and from that Worm another  aenez  to supply her place Nay further  we not behold Grain thrown into the  round continue there for a Season as if  st and dead but when warmth and moi  ure gives it force it springs up and bears  hundredfold Yea Herbs and plants  hilst Winter with his Icy Arms grasps  Earth seem dead retiring as it were  to the Grave and wait the Resurrection  the Spring But to conclude as to this  point the infinite  Love towards Man  may convince him that he was not made to be annihilated since the second Person of the Trinity condescended to take his Nature upon him even He who is the Wisdom of the Father and of whom the wise Man testifies it the d of  Proverbs  viz  I was with God in the beginning before any thing  made I was with him from Eternity when  compassed in the Depth by Law I was  when he sustained the Heavens above and  Earth beneath I was with him ordering  things and was continually delighted befo  him recreating my self in the Earth and  Delight was with the Sons of Men  CHAP V Of Monsters and monstrous Births and the re  son thereof according to the Opinion of su  dry Learned Men with serious Considerati  whether Monsters are endued with reasona  Souls  THAT many Monstrous Births ha  happened contrary to the Course  Nature is evident not only in this  in former Ages wherefore I shall ta  some Pains for the Satisfaction of  Reader  to enquire into the cause of such preposterous Forms  Now a Monstrous Habit or Shape of Body is contracted divers ways as from Fear sudden Frights exstraordinary Passion  he Influence of the Stars the Mother's strange Imaginations and divers Phantasms which the Mind conceive deform the Body and render the Children of an impro  er Shape and many times not perfect in either Sex sometimes the whole course of Nature is changed either when the Principles of Generation are vitiated on the Organs unfit so that the natural Faculties to propogate and form the Child cannot perform their Office exactly for as the most ingenious Artist can bring nothing to perfection if his Materials be bad or out of order so Nature wanting the force of her Facultiesâ–ª or not having fit matter must of necessity proceed to preposterously in forming the Child As in the Art of melting Metals it may be observed if the Matter be Impure and not well cleansed the Vessels or Receiver  Oblique  and full of Windings not well joyned the Corners set awry and full of Chinks' or Plates if loosed or holds ill together it is apparent Men cast illshaped Figures So if the Womb or the Matter be unfit or ill tempered 'tis impossible without an extraordinary  overruling Providence but above all unseasonable or intemperate Venery is the cause of so many monstrous Shapes  So the  LowCountrey  Women especially those living near the Seaside being restless and troubled in Copulation bring forth mishapen  Embroy's  or rude and deformed Burthens not only without motion but some that pant and are alive and these most commonly happen in case of Sailors or Mariners who coming home rashly Marry or run upon their Wives without any due regard to their Menstrual Flux or the Wombs cleansing it self to the Season of the Year or the Moon or Sun's Progress through the Coelestial Signs not are the Women without regard to the Health or Shape of their Posterity less desirous to receive them after a long separation which is not only exceeding hurtful to themselves from thence proceed not monstrous and untimely Births only but dangerous Diseases often to those who rashly proceed The first say the  Antiants  is because the Seed mixing with Menstrual Blood contract an unnatural Mass of corrupt Matter which either turns to Miscarrage Abortion or a Monstrous and Deformed Birth for by that means the Faculty of the Womb say they loseth its  force to Generation and success of Breeding the Child or if it try to come to any thing it is at most some monstrous Form not shaped like a man unless in some parts which after a long continuance in the Womb will come forth with great pain and labour not like to this There is an Efflux that greatly trobles such as by their inconsiderate rashness are subject to it  Our Women because Conception begins in the forth Moon when the  Menses  flow down by force and that Planet in Conjunction call it a Moonbirth or many kinds And some are of Opinion that this Copulation may be made without the help of a Man by force of Imagination in those that are extreamly Lascivious for that by often feeling and touching their Husbands at the same time strongly fancying themselves in the Act their Seed flows to the Blood and is by the Heat of the Womb formed into a foul Mass but arrives at no perfection And to the same purpose is it when Men strive against the Stream entring into Copulation in the forth and silent Moon and in the forth day of its Conjunction for then not observing Nature's Rules he either loseth his labour or Generates a monstrous Birth or if it chance which is almost next to a miracle to be perfect it is by the  Latins  called a  Birth of the Fourth Moon because the Product is commonly unhappy in all the Series of its Life having had its entrance by Generation contrary to Nature's Ordersâ–ª which  Moses  considering or being so commanded by God strictly commanded the  Hebrew  Men not to touch a Woman that was unclean of her Blood and those that have been so rashly profligate of either Sex have many times by sad Experience found their wilful Folly too late but especially the Female  Sex  for by the violent Concussion and Motion us'd in Copulation and evil Mixture the Contagion by Degrees will seize upon the whole Body causing the Pox and Leprosie The like Effects i  has upon Men if the Woman be infectedâ–ª especially if he deal with Whores at such times who commonly are infected and may be accounted so many walkingContagions or Emissaries of the Prince o  Darkness for the Destruction of Mankind and at this Day the greatest Pest and Grievance of the Nation  These things rightly considered no Ma  need wonder at so many misshapen Births and monstrous People with ScaldHeads bowed and distorted Legs Arms and Backs wry Necks crumpled Feet incident to Swellings in the Groin Buboes and Emeroids as also that their minds are dull stupid forgetful  foolish mad and unreasonable which attended the effects of unseasonable and unreasonable Venery which every Creature but Man observes in the Season Nature has allotted and when their Female have conceived they desire no longer but rest satisfied  Therefore let Man who is endued with a rational Soul and ought above all other Creatures to have Dominion over his Appetite and Affection consider how cruel he is to his Posterity that brings such mischief upon them and chiefly they are here to be understood that are conceived in the fourth Moon when the Woman's natural Flux is upon her therefore all Men ought to restrain neither should the Woman dare to copulate with  Man  as better knowing when that is upon her than some rash inconsiderate and unexperienced Novices of the  Masculine Gender  do for the Children then conceived want all or most of those Gifts and Properties that Children begotten at seasonable times are endued withal being capable of nothing that is good nor great and if it so happen they do any thing well they have ill success in their Undertakings by Reason their natural Faculties are short not by their own but their Parents Fault who undecently in Procreation violate Nature's Law whence it is that many things are wanting to them or else  give them sparingly and with some ill qualities that others obtain bountifully and then suffer no less loss in their mind for they want almost their common Senses and are extream dull without the sharpness of wit quickness of Invention Council and Prudence that others have  Lavi  ius Leminus  a famous Physitian tells of a monstrous Birth from his own knowledge the Relation of which I take in his words as I find them in his Book of Generation  In former Years  says he  there was a Woman an  Islander  who had Married a Mariner that took Physick of me and after Copulation having Conceived by him her Belly began to Swell to such a vast magnitude that one would have thought it could not have held to support the Burthen  When nine  Months  were expired the  Midwife  was called and first with great trouble she was delivered of a rude lump which I conceive was a  Superfatation  after a lawful Conception there was fastned unto it on both sides two Handles like two Arm for the length and the fashon of them it panted and seemed to be alive as sea Fishes called  Vatica  and by the Dutch  Elschowe  which float in the Sea in Summer in infinite numbers and being taken out they run abroad and when you handle them melt with a burning and prickling left behind them  whence they had their Name after this a Monster came forth of her Womb with a crooked Back long round Neck and fiery Eyes and a pointed Tail being very nimblefooted for as soon as it came forth it gave the affrighted Midwife the slip and run up and down the Room to seek a hiding place till at last one Woman more couragious than the rest fell upon it with a Cushion and smothered it This Monster had sucked the Blood from the Child which came forth after it being a Male and so eaten the Flesh that it scarcely lived to be Christned nor could the Woman be in a long time restored to her Strength And farther adds that upon his Enquiry she told him that it had proceeded as she thought from unreasonable and extraordinary and insatiate Venery  Hereupon  says he  I prescribed her a wholsom Course of Life and Medicines to restore her Forces for she was become wonderful Lean  These and many such like things should teach all Men and Women to use Decency and orderly Proceedings in their mutual Embracings lest Nature wronged thereby monstrous Births ensue in which Respect some lascivious People are much to be condemned who suppose they may do what they listâ–ª and will by no means have their Pleasure bounded and above all Pocket  and Gouty People are most lascivious th  one thro' the Heat contracted in the Blood and the other through the polite Windiness passes through the Veins and afflicts the Nerves Others again observe not whether their Stomach be full or empty or the Meat be raw or digested whether it be by Day or Night nay never regard the season or opportunity of Time but as their Lusts and Desires prompts them but such insatiable Lechers are or at least seem to be wilfully ignorant to what end they were created Male and Female which was  to beget Children  and  propagate their Kind  not for obscene Purposesâ–ª and beastly pleasures but at last they pay for their unruly Lust when the Disorder  of Body as Aches Gout and many Diseases contracted thereby Rack and Torment them  The last thing in this Chapter to be considered is whether monstrous Births have  Reasonable Souls  and whether such shall appear at the Day of Resurrection in discussing of which I shall cite the Opinions of such learned  Divines  and  Physitians  as have made curious search and diligently weighed these great Mysteries And first it is their Opinion not jointly but severall that all those that are like Men according to the  rder of Generation deduced from our  primitive Parents proceeded by natural means from either Sex though they are deformed and of monstrous shape having notwithstanding a Reasonable Soul shall when they have run the Date of Mortality be capable of Resurrection to Immortality but those that proceed not from Man but by the Woman's unnaturally mixing with other Creatures shall not participate of Immortality but perish as brute Beasts because such a monstrous Birth is not capacitated to receive a divine Part or Soul which should entail him to the Resurrection  There are indeed amongst the number of Men and Women that tread the Terrestial Globe divers that are monstrously deformed and of horrid Aspect with distorted Jaws and GoggleEyes and many other marks of Deformity but these tho' by their Parents rashness in indecent or unseasonable Copulation or the Defect of Nature being thus disordered yet are they referred to the number of Men and Women because they speak understand and act which demonstrate them to have reasonable Souls and therefore shall they stand upon the Earth at the last Day and at the  Resurruction  all Deformity shall be done away and they shall appear in perfect Shape and the Organical Parts render  the Soul that shall then return a free scope to  act  and operate but imperfect and abortve Births or Mischances where the Limbs are not fashoned or very  imperfect  want a reasonable Soule it not being as yet infused by the Almighty shall have no part in the  Resurection    Many Phisicians there are and indeed most of them make diffrence betwen a Mischance and Abortion The former of which say they is when there is a Conception but through the slipperiness or weakness of the womb it drops out e'er any shape is  contracted  being only a Rude unframed Mass properly called Rudiments of a Child that should have been and a shadow of what was begun but Abortion oft times shews the parts of the Infant  perfectly  composed which if it be cast forth by fright or untimely force and has not accomplished the day to receive the Soul then it shall not participate of Immortality but if it be quick and cast out though it live not an our after it is first enlivened then it has received an Imortal Soul for although many things are wanting in it and it come not to its full Magnitude yet in the  Resurrection  all shall be made up that time would have produced And as Children have many things  inpossibility that with times progress shews themselves as Teeth Nails Hair and fullstature of Body which increases by degrees and come to  perfections  so in the  Resurection  all things that are  defective  shall be made  perfect  Whosoever therefore is both of the seed of Man and not of some foul Matter or vitious Humour concurring though his shape be monstrous yet as I said he shall rise again from Death to Life all  defects  being repared by the Divine Powers that then will manifest it self no less then in Creation nay more for St  Austin  is of the Opinion it is easier to Create Men then to Raise them when they are Dead  c  Though the Earthly Matter whereever scattered is not perished in sight of God who can with his Word recal it from the Four Winds of Heaven and restore it to its pristin Vigour nay though vanished into Air and other Elemnets or what Leanness or Hunger have consumed or Diseases have wasted or what is burnt to Ashes or is passed in the first Principles or in the substance of some other Body for the Flesh shall be restored to whome it was taken as his due that was borrowed from him by  he mighty working of him who is able  o subdue all things to himself Those  hat are Men shall find this to be true and  those monstrous Shapes that proceed from them indued with rational Souls and participating the same Nature with them shall participate the same Benefit of the Resurrection  CHAP VI A more peculiar and exact Treatise of this happy Estate of Matrimony as 'tis appointed byâ–ª and the true Felicity that redounds thereby  either Sex and to what end it was ordained  CErtainly the joyning of Hearts in a matrimonial State is of all Conditions the happiest for then a Man has whom to unravel his Thoughts to as well as a sweet Companion in his Labour he has an  ternus Sensus  another Self one in whose Breast as in a safe Cabinet is reposed his inmost Secrets especially where reciprocal Love and inviolate Faith is centred for there no Cares Fears Jealousies Mistrust o  Hatred can ever interpose for what Man as 'tis observed in Holy Writ ever hated his own Flesh and indeed a Wife is no less  rightly considered for our grand Paren  well observed she is or ought to be so esteemd of every honest Man  Bone of hi  Bone and Flesh of his Flesh c  Nor wa  it the least care of the Almighty to ordain so near a Union and especially for two Causes the first for Increase of Posterity the second to bridle and bound Man's wandering Desires and Affections nay that they might be yet happier when God had joyn'd them together he blessed them as 'tis in the d of  Genesis Colamela  no mean Author considering and contemplating on this happy State tells us out of the  Oeconomy  of  Xenophon  That Matrimonial Conjunction appointed by Nature is not only the most pleasant but profitable course of Life that may be entred on for the Preservation and Increase of Posterity wherefore since the Harbour of Marriage is most safe sure and delightful Station of Mankind who is exceeding prone by the dictates of Nature to propagate his Like he does in no wise provide amiss for his own Tranquility who enters it especially when he comes to Maturity of Years for there are many Abuses and Errors in Marriage contrary to what is ordained the which in the ensuing chapter I shall expose to View But to proceed  Seeing our blessed Saviour and his Apostles detested obscene and unlawful Lusts and pronounced those to be excluded the Kingdom of Heaven that polluted themselves with Adultery and Whoring I cannot conceive any objection be made  hereto or what Face such lewd Persons can have to colour their Impieties who hating Matrimony make it their Study how they may live freely and licentiously without Marriage but certainly in so doing they rather seek to themselves Torment Anxiety and Disquietude than certain Pleasure besides the Hazard of their Immortal Souls for certain it is that Mercenary Love or as the Wise Man calls them  Harlots Smiles  cannot he true and sincere and therefore not pleasant but rather a Net laid to  betray  such as thrust them into all Mischief as  Solomon  observes  by  the  young Man  who turned aside to an Harlot's House  going  said he  as a Bird to the Snare of the Fowler or as an Ox to the Slaughter till a Dart is struck through the Liver  Nor in this Case can  they  have Children those sweet and endearing Pledges of Conjugal Love or if they have  they  will rather redound to their Shame than Comfort  Harlots  likewise are like Swallows Singing and Chattering to their Morning Walk and Summer Season of  Prosperity  but the black  stormy  Winter of  Adversity  coming  they  take Wing and pass into other Regions to expand themselves before a warmer Sun but a vertuous chast Wife fixing intire Love upon her Husband and submitting to him as her Head and him  by  whose Direction she ought to steer in all lawful Courses  will like a faithful Companeon share  paitiently  with him in both Adversities run with cheerfulness through all Difficulties and Dangers though never so hazardous to preserve or assist him in Poverty Sickness or whatever else is incide  to Human Frailty acting ac  ording to her Duty in all things when a  roud imperious Harlot will do no more  hen she list even in the prosprous Day  nd is lik a Horseleach ever craving and  ever satis fied still seeming displeased if she  ave not every thing she desires not regard  ng the Ruin and Misery of him she with flatter  ng and feigning Charms pretends to admire and  upon him using to confirm her Hypocrisie with  Crocodile's  Tears Vows and Swoonings when her Gallant is to depart for a while  seems to deny her imodrate Desire but  his lasts no longer then she can gratifie her Appetite and prey upon his Fortunes  Conradus Gesner  tells us a Story  That  young Man travelling from  Athens  to  hebes  met by the way a Beautiful Lady  to his Appearance she seemed adorned with all Perfections of Beauty glittering with Gold and Precious Stones who salu  ed him and invited him to her House in an  djacent Vilage  pretending to be exceedingly  namour'd of him declard she had a long  ime watch'd the opportunity to find him  a  one that she might declare the extream  Passion  she conceived for him When he came to her House he found it to appearance very sumptuously built and gloriously furnish'd with whate'er could seem costly and gay which so far wrought upon his Covetous Inclination  that he resolv'd to put off his intended Journey  and  comply with her desire but whilst she was leading him to see the pleasant Places came by  Holy Pilgrim  who peceiving in what danger the Youth was resolved to see him in his righ  Senses and shew him what he imagined realâ–ª was quite otherwise  so that by powerful Prayer the Mist was taken from before the Youth's Eyes whenas he beheld his Lady ugly deformed and monstrous and tha  whate'er had appear'd  gloreous  and  beautiful  was only  Trash  Then he made her confes  what she was  and  her design upon the Young Man  which she did saying  She was a  Lamiae  or  Fury  and that she had enchanted hi  on purpose to get him unto her Power that sh  might devour him  â–ª This Passage may  fitly alluded to Harlots who draw thos  that follow their misguided Lights int  Places of Danger and Difficulty even til  they have shipwracked their Fortunes and leave them to struggle with the tempe  stuous Waves of Adversity But on th  contrary a loving Chast and eventem  pered Wife seeks what she may to peve  such danger striving on the one hand to pre  serve  it asmuch as the other does to destroy it And in a word as there is no content in the Embraces of a Harlot so there is no Joy greater than in reciprocal Love and the indearing Embraces of a  Loving Obedient  and  Chast  Wife nor is that the principal end for which Matrimony was ordained but further that Man might lawfully procreate his like and increase his Generation to replenish the Earth To conclude a Virtuous Wife is a Crown and Ornament to her Husband and her Price is above Rubies but the Ways of an Harlot are deceitful  CHAP VII Of Errors in Marriage and what they too frequently are and the Prejudice that arises thereby  IF any be desirous to enter into the Holy State of Matrimony let them observe their Ability and Constitution of Body and not run themselves rashly upon Inconveniencies for those who marry too young may rightly be termed to marry unseasonably not considering their Inability nor examining the Force of Nature as divers there are before they are ripe for the consummation  of so weighty a matter who either rashly of their own accords by the instigation of Bawds Procures or Marriagebrokers or forced thereto by their Parents who covet a larg Dowrey take upon them this Yoke to their great Prejudice  Lavinus Lemnius  says That he has known some of them who before the expiration of a year have been thereby so infeebled and weakned that all their vital Moisture was exausted so that he was upon their applying themselves to him obliged with Medicaments to restore their Strength that was fallen and sunk down wherefore his advice is That it is no way convenient to suffer Children or such as are not of Age to mary or get Children But whosoever proposes to marry must chieft observe this that he choose one to his Companion and Partner in his Felicity that is of an honest Stock and proceeding from temperate Parents though her Dowry be not so large as he could wish that he observe the Conversation and find therein that she is chaste well bred and of good manners For a woman as the  Comedian  saith if she hath good Conditionsâ–ª she has Portion enough That of  Alcamena  in  Plautus  is a witty saying which all Maids and others of the Female Sex should retain shew in remembrance I do not think  saith she that to be my Dowry which is called so But Chastity Modesty and a setled desire to fear God to love my Parents and agree with my Kindred to obey my Husband to be bountiful and to do good to such as are Virtuous and Honest Now if she proved as good as she promised such a Wife was to be valued above the Price of Rubies  'Tis Duty incombent upon Parents to be careful in bringing up their Children in the way of Virtue and have ever a regard that they fully not their Honour and Reputation especially the Females and most of all Virgins when they grow up to be marriageble for if through the unnatural severity of rigid Parents they be crossed and frustrated in their love many of them out of a mad humour if temptations lie in their way throw themselves into the unchaste Arms of a subtle charming Tempter being through ahe softness of good Nature and strong Desire to pursue their Appetites easily induced to believe Men's Flatteries and feigned Vows of promised Marriage to cover the shame and then too late the Parents find the effects of their rash Severity which brought a lasting stain upon their Family Now as 'tis an Error in marrying too young so it is unequality of Mariage between Age and Youth as a  young Man who to make his Fortune marries to a Woman that for Age might be his Grandmother between whom for the most part Jealousies and Discontents happen nor is it possible such Women should have Children be the Man never so sprightly and young The like may be said though with a little more excuse when an old doting Fellow marries a young Virgin in the Summer Season of her youth and Vigour who whilst he strives and vainly strains to please her is the sooner wedded to the Grave For as in Childhood or green Youth 'tis unfit and unreasonable to think of Marriage so in old Age to marry unequal is altogether the same for they that enter upon it too soon are soon exhausted and fall into Consumption and divers other Diseases and those that Procrastinate and marry unseemly fall into the like ill conveniences on the other side having only the Honour to be dubbed a Knight of the Forked Order and have their Names inrolled in the Collony of Cuckoldom especially if their Wives have not been trained up in the Paths of Virtue and lie to much open to Importunity and Temptation of lewd and debanched Menâ–ª And thus much for Errors or Oversights in rash and unseasonable preposterous Marriages  CHAP VIII The Opinions of the Learned concerning Children conceived and born within the space of Seven Months with lively Arguments upon the Subjectâ–ª to prevent Suspitions of Incontinency and the bitter Contests that thereon too often arise between Man and Wife To which is added Rules for knowing the Disposition of Man's Body by the General Parts  CErtain it is that many bitter Quarels have arisen through Misunderstanding when solid Reason would have rectified the Judg+ment and have prevented the Conception of such an Evil and from whence does this arise but through Suspicion and Jealousie when indeed it is many times founded upon a slender Foundation as the new Married Woman's being brought to Bed before the Expiration of Nine Months which is Vulgarly taken from the time of Conception to the Birth To remove which groundless Suspicion I shall endeavour not that i  'tis common dare I avouch but that 'tis possible and has been frequently known that Children have been born at Seven Months but the matter being wholy left  the Lawyers who decide  Controversies to the Phisicians to Judge of it is in their power to determine by inspecting the Child whether it is a Child of seven eight nine or ten Months  Paul  the Councellor has this Passage in his ninettenth Book of Pleadings  viz  It is now a received Truth that a perfect Child may be born in the seventh Month by the Authority of the learned  Hypocrates  And therefore we must believe that a Child born at the end of the seventh Month in lawfull Matrimony may be lawfully begotten  Galen  in  Chap  of his third Book handleth this Argument but rather according to Mens Opinion then according to the truth of the business or from natural Reasons who supposeth there is no certain time set for bearing Cheldren And from the Authority of  Pliny  who makes mention of a Woman that went thirteen Months with Child But as to what concerns the seventh Month saith  Lemnus  I know many married people in  Holland  that had Twins who lived extream old Age their Bodies lusty and their Minds apt and lively wherefore their Opinion is foolish and of no moment who asserts That at Seven Months a Child cannot be perfect and long lived and that he cannot in all parts be perfect till the ninth Month and thereupon this learned Author proceeds to tell a passage from his own knowledge as follows  Of late  saith he  there  happened a great Disturbance amongst us which ended not without Bloodshed and was occasioned by a Virgin whose Chastity had been violated descending of  Noble Family and ever before that time held to be of unspotted Fame Now seve  al there were who charged the Matter upon a Person of Note  viz  a Judge President of a City in  Flanders  who strongly denied the Fact saying that he was ready  o swear it upon the Holy Evangelist that he never had carnal Copulation with her  nd that he would by no means therefore  e taken for the Father of the Child that was not his and further alledged that he  erily believed that it was a Child born in  even Months and that himself was many miles distant from the Mother of it when  t was conceived whereupon the Judges  efore whom the Hearing was decreed That the Child should be viewed by the  ble Physicians as also experienced Women  nd that they should make their Report who having made diligent Inquiry all of  hem with one accord concluded the Child without respecting who was the Father was a Child born within the Space of se  en Months that it was carried in the Mother's Womb but Twenty seven Weeks and  ome odd Days but if she could have carried  it to Months the Childs Parts and Limbs would have been more firm and strong and the structure of the Body mor  compact and fast for the Skin was ex  ceeding loose and the Breastbone that de  fends the Heart and the Swordlike Gri  stle that lies over the Stomach were hig  e  than naturally they should be not plain bu  crooked and sharpridged or pointed lik  those of young Chickens that are hatche  in the beginning of the Spring And ben  a Female Infant it wanted its Nails upo  her Fingers and the utmost Joints of he  Fingers upon which from the musculou  or cartilaginous matter of the Skin Nai  that are very smooth do come and by de  grees harden she had instead of Nails thin Skin or Film as for her Toes the  was not the least Appearance of Nails  bout them by reason that they wanted  Heat that was communicated to the Fi  gers from the nearness of the Heart The  and the like weighty Matters being consid  red and above all one Gentlewoman  Quality that assisted affirmeth that  had been the Mother of Children an  that divers of them had been born an  lived at Months they without favour any made their Report that the Infant  a Child of months annd so must be a  counted tho' it was born within the  venth  Month for that in such Cases the revolution or circuit of the Mood ought to be observed which perfects it self in bare Weeks or somewhat less than Days in which space of her Revolution the Blood being agitated by the  Moons Force  the Courses of the Woman flow from them which being spent and the  Matrix  cleansed from the menstrual Blood which happens on the th Day then if on the th Day a Man lie with his Wife the Copulation is most natural and the Conception best and a Child then gotten may be born in the th Month and prove very healthful so that upon this report the supposed Father was pronounced innocent upon proof that he was miles distance all that Month in which the Child was begot And as for the Mother she strongly denied that she knew the Father being forced in the Dark and that through Fear and Surprize was left in Ignorance  As for Coition it ought not be had unless the Parties be in health lest it turn to the disadvantage of the Children so begotten creating in them through the abundant ill Humours divers lingring and languishing Diseases wherefore Health is no where better to be discerned than by the  Genitals  of the Man wherefore Midwives and other skilful Women in former days were wont  to see the Testicles of Children thereby to conjecture or guess at their temper or state of Body and young men may know thereby the Signs or Symptoms of Life and Death for if the Cases of the Testicles be loose and feeble and the Gods fall down it denotes the natural Faculties and the vital Spirits which are the proper Props of Life are fallen But if the secret Part be wrinkled and raised up it is a Sign all will be well But that the Event may exactly answer the Prediction it is necessary to consider what Part of the Body the Disease possesseth for if it chance to be the upper Part that is afflicted as the Head or Stomach then will it not so well appear by the Members which frequently are unconcerned with such Grievances but the lower part of the Body exactly sympathizing with them their Liveliness on the contrary makes it apparent for Nature's Force and the Spirits that have their Intercourse first manifest themselves therein which occasions  Midwives  to feel the Genitals of Children to know in what Part the Grief is resident and whether Life or Death be portended thereby the Symptoms being strongly communicated by the Vessels that have their intercourse with the principal Seat of Life  CHAP IX The cause of the  GreenSickness  in  Virgins  with its  Symptoms  and Directions for its Cure Together with the chiefest Occasion of Barrenness in Women and by what means to remove the Cause and render them fruitful  THE former of these Inconveniences is too apparent in Virgins especially such as are of a Flegmatick Complection evidently shewing it self by discolouring the Face in making it look Green Pale or of a dusky Yellow which proceeds from raw undigested Humours nor only doth it appear to the Eye but sensibly afflicts such as it possesses with difficulty of breathing Pains in the Head Palpitations of the Heart unusual beatings and small throbings of the Arteries in the Temples Neck and Back many times casting them into Fevers if the Humour be very vitious also loathing of Meat and the distension of the Hypocondriack Part by reason of the Inordinate Efflux of the  Menstruous Blood  to the greater Vessels and by reason of the abundance of Humour the whole Body is often troubled with swelling or if not at least the Thighs Legs and Ankles all  above the Heels And also there is a Weariness of the whole Body without any reason at all for it  The  Galeni  ts  say That this Distemper proceeds chiefly from the Obstruction of those Vessels that are about the Womb occasioned by the abundance of gross viscid and crude Humours arising from the several inward causes but there are also outward  which have a share in the production of i  as taking cold in the Feet drinking of Water Intemperance in Diet and also the Eating of things wholly contrary to Nature  viz  raw or burnt Flesh Ashes Coals old S  o  s Chalk Wax Nutshells Mortar Lime Oatmeal Tobaecopipes which occasion not only a Suppression of the  Menses  but likewise obstructions through the whole Body Therefore the first thing necessary to eradicate the Cause is Matrimonial Conjunction and such Copulation that may prove to the satisfaction of her that is afflicted for by that means the  Menses  will begin to flow according to their natural and due Course and the  Humours  being diffus'd and dispersed will soon waste themselves and then no more matter being administred to increase them they will vanish and a good temperament of Body will return But in case such a Conjunction cannot be had so  soon as necessity requires then let th  Damsel  blood in the Ankle and if she be about you may likewise do it in the Arm though suffer her not to bleed overmuch especially if the Blood be good If the Disease be of any Continuance then it is to be eradicated by  Purgation Perpetration  of the  Humour  being first considered which may be done by the Virgins drinking Decoction of  Cuaiacum  with  Dittany  of  Creet  But the best Purge in this Case ought to be made of  Aloes Agarick  Rhub  r  And then for strengthening the Bowels and opening Obstructions  Ch  lyheet Medicines  are chiefly to be used The Diet must be moderate and sharp things as Vinegar  c  to be by all means avoided And for the unobstructing of the  Humour  take Prepared Steel BezoarStone the Root of Scorzonera and the Oyl of Chrystal in small Wine and let the Diet be moderate but in no wise let Vinegar be used therewith nor upon any other Occasion And in so doing observing the Humours will be dilated dissipated and transfused by which Means the Complexion will return and the Body be lively and full of Vigour And now since Ba  renness daily occasions Discontent and that Discontent creates Difference between Man and Wife or by immoderate Grief frequently calls the Woman into  one or other violent Distemper I shall somewhat largely treat thereof  Sterility proceeds from divers Causes but most commonly from some Defect in the Organs of Generation Upon the Woman's Part it most commonly happens from the strict Closure of the Mouth of the  Womb  which will not admit the Seed and sometimes from the straitness of the Sharebone which denies Entrance to the  Penis  sometimes also from Ulcers or Exorescences in the Neck of the  Womb  To these may be added too much Fatness which straitens the Passage of the  Matrix    Most of the Antients are of Opinion that Conception is hindered commonly by the Humidity and Moisture of the Womb when by reason thereof it cannot retain the Seed or by bad Humours heaped up there and corrupting it or strange Defect of the  Menstruous  Blood But certain it is that it proceeds either from some Tumour Ulcer Excrescence or by some faults or other of the  Womb Ovaria  or  Oviducts  For if the Eggs are not impregnated with the  Aura virilis  or Seminal Spirits there can be no Conception the Testicles of Women having no such Office as those of Men but containing Eggs analogous to those of Fowl and other Creatures  Now if the Orifice of the Womb be closed that the Seed cannot enter or rather the  Two Wings  or  Nymphae  so far that the  Penis  cannot pass the Neck of the Womb it must be opened with an Instrument and subject to this Defect in Nature are many Women especially in hot Countries but most of all in  Egypt  where the Chyrurgeons are forced with Silver Instruments to make way for the Instrument of Generation a thing not altogether unpracticable in  England  In Case the Neck of the Womb be so strait that the Yard cannot enter then is the Case to be  wh  t  er  t be Naturally  from some Swelling or  thin or without and if any  it is  or the most part  it be a Natural Straitness  Tent dipped in Oil  of  Eggs  and drink  sweetned with SugarCandyâ–ª  and Evening and by the Operati  n thereof the Womb will in all parts  or if it so happen in a Young  Nature will increase the Passage and  produce things fitting to their  Satisfacti  n but let no Man by Viol  e endeavour to force the Passage  the Vessels Nay endanger  it self which has  been broke with such violent intrusion and so cost the Woman her Life  If the Neck of the Womb be ulcerated or any Excrescences happen there which equally hinder Copulation then may they be known by the  Pain  and  Shooting  upon the least  Compressure  and the Issuing forth of  Putrid Humour  and sometimes  Blood  if the Ulcers be great and the  Menses  flow the  Water hot Pains arising  in the  Forepart  of the  Head  and oftentimes they occasion  Gentle Feavers    And all these  Obstructi  ns of Generation  happen divers ways sometimes from external Causes  viz Rash Physick hard Labours  or  excessive Copulation  and sometimes from internal as the  Corruption  of the  Secudine  the  Courses  too long retained or obstructed  Heat  and  overflowing  of the  Vrinal Vessels Vi  ulent Gonorrheas Pox Inflamations  turned into  Aposthumesâ–ª Humours  flowing from divers parts of the Body and settling there all which must be duly considered  Now some are in the outward part and may be the easier come at and External Applica  ions are most convenient to be applied thereto but those that cannot be come at must be cured if possible by  Injection  the best  Injection  in this Case is as follows  viz  Break Four Eggs and take the Whites only the which heat with an equal quantity of RoseWater mingled with PlantainWater Litharge of Gold Camphire BoleA  moniack Ce  us of each a Dram half a Dram of Green Coperas all which well Beatenâ–ª Dissolved and mixed together strained through a Fine Cloath and with a Syring eject it Morning and Evening till the Gr  ef cease and if it smart that it cannot well be endured you may sometimes inject warm Milk to cleanse the Putrified Matter  Others there are that are not so violent and therefore admit of any easie Cure not being so deep known by a  Putrid Greenish Matter  that flows from them To Cure this Take Water wherein Barly has been boiled Honey of Roses new Milk and Sugar with the Decoction of Lentils and after that gentle Astringents must be applied some again are sordid having much contagious Humour flowing from them to cure which stronger Medicaments must be applied Others there are that eat into the Flesh having a green contagion flowing from them to cleanse which Aloes and Wormwood concocted in Whitewine are most requisite  Another sort of Ulcers there are which appear long eating away the Skin from off the Neck of the Womb and are discerned by the Blood and Pain they occasion immediately upon the Concression appearing in the neck of the  Womb  much like Chilblains occasioned by ill Lying extraordinary Venery by violent Inflammation or Flux of sharp Humours The best Cure after a gentle Purge is an Astringent Clyster and after that to anoint them with the Grease that fryes out of a Ladle often used in a Kitchen when it is held to the Fire mixed with  Vnguentum Album  or  Pomatum  If the Defect be in the Seed through tenderness of Age in the Woman then the best Remedy is convenient Diet moderate Exercise and temperate Air together with the Patience in the Man till Nature in process of time operates so effectually that all things appear and conspire to mutual satisfaction  If the Woman be stricken in Years and the Time of breeding Children be past which in some happens sooner and others later according to their several Constitutions but generally between    and    unless strong Preparatives  viz  an extraordinary Diet easie Lodging and a moderate Exercise restore them those Women must despair of further Generation  For as the Learned in this Art frequently observe Where is neither Buds nor Blossoms can be no Fruit  If Sterility be occasioned by Obstructions in the Vessels which it often does then the Cause must be enquired into and this often happens the which is known by the small desire to  Venery  and that little or no Satisfaction receiv'd thereby a settling in the Courses and a slimy Flegmatick matter mixed therewith as also by their Inordinate flowing occasion'd by the Plenty of  Humours  collected in the  Womb  which by reason of the abundance of windy Vapours contracted therein cause Obstructions to which may be added a cold  Flegmatick Constitution  and from thence it isâ–ª that sudden Paleness arises in the Face to remedy this the Party must alter her Diet not eating any Cold Raw Flegmatick Substance but rather such things as are apt to stir up  Cholerick Hot Humours  in the Body as  Anniseeds  or  Carrawayseeds  in her Bread store of  PennyRoyal  in her Broth let her likewise each Morning for a Week together make a Posse  in which she must boil the Roots of  Birthwort Angelica Sage Rosemary Cinnamon  and  Borage  The taking the Male Herb  Mercury Dittany Centaury Marigolds Cubebs Saffron Mugwort  and  CloveGilliflowers    of each a handful boil them in Whitewine and eject the Concoction by little and little at sundry times as the Cold or Obstruction can be perceived anointing the Belly and Reins of the Back one Day with Oyl of  Cinnamon  next with the Oyl of  Nutmeg  or  Mace  and the third with the Oyl of  Myrrh  and so continuing to do for a  together When the Woman lies down Nature will be wonderfully restored and recover such Force as to remove the Obstruction  Many there are that conceive  Barrenness  is frequently caused by  Inchantation  but those Opinions are altogether frivolous and vain  If the Womb be defective in its Retentive Faculty Men frequently labour in vain in such a Case the Women must avoid Sorrow Anger or much Sleep Eating new Cheese Milk and raw Food especially Lettuce Endive Spinage Beets Nuts Cherries Pussane Onions Garlick and the like they all being hurtful to Generation Nor must she drink nor use Vinegar nor eat the Fat of Me  t too frequently but the Womb must be cleansed from the overa  undant Moisture with the Decoction of Ha  tsTongue an herb so call'd Cummin Fennel and Aniseed and strengthned with the Syrup of  Wormwood    and for a gentle operative Purge in this Case take half an Ounce of Laudanum Beeswax Sheeps Suet and Agarick of each a like quantity melt and bruise them after which make them up into little Pills and take three in the Morning and next to them take of this Confection to the Bigness of a Nutmeg  viz  The shavings of Ivoryâ–ª AshKeys yellow and wild R  peseed SilverMontanus with red and white  Behen  of each One Dram Cinnamon Galinga LongPepper Cloves and Mace Balsamwood RosemaryFlowers  Blatiae Bezaria  GentleMarjoram and Pennyroyal of each Scruples Balm Bugloss Citrons Reils of each Scruples Pearl dissolved or beaten to Powder One Scruple Musk two Grains White Sugar One Pound and an half bruise them and seeth them over a gentle Fire in as much Malmsey as will make them into a Confection This Confection is indeed of a most singular and approved one in all cases on Barr  ness where Cold or Obstructions of the Vessels do occasion Weakness in the Womb  Other causes of Barrenness there are when the Womb grows f  t as we have said beforeâ–ª  o that the Caul swelling and bearing beyond its bounds with its Fatness obstructs the Passage into the Wombâ–ª to prevent which the Woman must not sleep  overmuch especially in the daytime nor feed riotously but exercise her self in walking or moderate Exercises and often use Purgation and strong Glisters made of Herbs and Drugs that are hot and dry which will in a short time remove such Obstructions  But a more dangerous Cause of Barrenness than yet I have named are the  Whites  which are contracted by an inordinate Erudition of an Excrementous Humour collected through the Vitiousness of the Blood incident to young and old at such times as they are capable of Generation and therefore the cure must be hastened by reason that in short time it derides Art and renders Women inevitably Barren occasioning Leanness Consumption Melancholy Dropsie Falling of the Womb Swooning  which renders it Difficult and dangerous in long continuance though in the beginning it may be easily removed In the Cure of this let  Phlebotomy  or  BloodLetting  be avoided for as much as the bad Humour must be by no means recalled to dense the Blood the Disease it self being a sufficient Weakning of the Body and vital Spirits First then to discuss the Humour in order to its Expurgation Take two ounces of  Guaiacum  the like quantity of  China  and  Leutickwood    boil them in Water and Honey drinking a Pint fresh made every Morning Then to dry up the Contraction of the Vessels or Humors that lodged there take the Root of  Filipendula  beat it to Powder and drink it in WhiteWine Morning and Evening As also for Astringents use Bones Burnt and beat to powder likewise the Ashes of Capons Dung ejected after a long time steeping in fair Water The Patient must likewise avoid sleeping upon her Back lest the Humor descend and contract in the Vessels of the Womb but let her be rubbed often to disperse them that they settle not in any one place  Sometimes this occasion of Barrenness happens through the violent Attraction of the Womb and then appears Signs of afflictions of the Womb the Flux not being so great to cure which Suffumations are the most proper and those may be made of Frankincense Laudanum Santalum or Mastick The Woman upon such Occasion having great regard to her self that she take not cold or proceed to intemperate Diet  Many Women there are whose violent Lusts contracts a heat that either destroys the Eggs or hinders them from being impregnated In this case 'tis requisite to avoid  hot Air soft Lying hot Meats and Spices and requisite to bleed in the Basilick Vein purge moderately with  Decoctum Epithymi  and Juice of Roses each two Drams and a half Whey half a Pint mix them together and drink them fasting in the Morning and so to continue hours after or for want of the former you may take  Trifera Sa  asenica  and Rhubarb of each half a Dram pulverized and mixed with Ounces of Syrup of Roses Violets or Endive but the most excellent Restorative to cool and moderate the Temper in this Case is Dietdrink made as followeth  viz  Take  Pistachia  Nuts and EringoRoots of each half an Ounce of Saffron a Dram  Lignum  Aloes Galinga Carophilata Mace red and white Behen and Balmflowers of each Scruples Shavings of Ivory Rhind of Cassia each Scruples Syrup of confected Ginger Ounces White Sugar Ounces add to these Ounces of BalmWater and set them over a gentle Fire permitting them to seeth then take it off suffer it to cool and put more Water to it stirring the Ingredients lastly increasing them with a Scruple and a half of Musk and Amber then strain the liquid Part and boil  t up again into a Conserve of which let the Woman eat three times a day but not exceeding the  bigness of a Walnut at a time The times most convenient are mornings noons and Nights and this let her continue till she  inds her Body in Temper  Another sort of Barrenness proceeds from the Obstruction of those Vessels  hrough which the monthly Purgatione  low in which case open the Basilick Vein  nd take from thence a moderate quantity  f Blood after which take  Hiera composita  nd  Opponax  of each half a Dram and  Dram of Syrup of  Gilliflowers  make  hem into Pills take them in the mor  ing and sleep upon them a considerable  ime then drink off half a pint of sugared Water and hours after a proportion of Syrup of Vinegar compounded For want of this take Syrup of Eupatory quar  ers of an ounce Female Mugwort and ElecampaneRoot of each an ounce with Syrup of Vinegar a proportionable quantiy mix them together and take them when made into an Electuary morning and Evening to the Quantity of a HazelNat at a time and if the Courses flow not within a short time after let a pessary of Musk Amber Wood of Alloes and Ash Keys of each two Grains Saffron half a Scruple Hares Renet an Ounce be put into the Womb Tentwise and continue there for the space of a day and it will remove  the Obstruction cause the Course to flow and in a short time render the Woman capable of Generation And thus  Reader  have I with much caution performed my promise in these particulars and the next thing I shall proceed toâ–ª amongst other matters relating to the Mystery of Generation are the Signs of Virginity  c  CHAP X Virginity what it is in what it consists and how violated together with the Opinions of the Learned in the Point of Mutation of Sexes in the Womb during the Operation of Nature in framing the Body  SEeing many ignorant People have boasted of their Knowledg as to the first Particular and some Virgins have undergone hard Censure through the ignorant Determinations of such as have taken upon them to discuss the Matter I thought it altogether necessary to clear the Point that so for the future the Conceited might not be indulged in their own Opinion nor by traducing others prejudice the Female Sex whose Vertues are frequently such as do not require our Admiration but Imitation  Then since the mysterious Word  iginity has puzled many to define it I  an the Cause from whence it arises for  Word barely in it self signifies the  ime chief or best of any thing But as  the Point in hand the main matter bears  following Construction It is observed  the curious Searchers into Nature's Se  ets that in young Maids or Females in  Sinus Pudoris  or in that place that is by  me called  the Neck of the Womb  is that  endulous Production vulgarly called  Hymen  but more rightly the  Claustrum  irginale  and in  French  it is termed the  teon de Rose  or Roies Bud for that it  uch resembles the Bud of a Rose expan  ed or a CloveGilliflower from whence derived the Word  Deflora  to  Deslower    the Deflowering of Virgins because most  of Opinion that the Virginity is altoge  er annihilated when this Duplication is  actured and dissipated by Violence and  at when it is found perfect and intire  Penetration has been made Also some  earned Physitians are of Opinion that  ere is not either Hymen or Skin expan  ed containing Blood in it which divers  magine in the first Copulation flows from  he fractured Expanse  Now this  Claustrum Virginale  or Flow is as it were composed or consisting o  Caruncles  â–ª or little Buds like  Myrtleberr  which in Virgins are full and Plump but Women flag and hang loose and these  placed in the four Angles of the  Sinus  doris  joyned or held together by  Membranes and Ligatures like Fibr  each of them scituate in the Intesticles Spaces between each  Caruncle  with wh  in a manner they are proportionably  stended which Membranes being once  lacerated denote Devirgination and ma  curious Coxcombs prying into this  the first night of their Marriage and findi  their Wives defective in this Point ha  ever after held them in evil esteem conc  ding it happened thro' the Effect of Cop  lation with some other who had been e  tertained in the Chambers of  Venus  N  one I knew that upon this vain Fancy to such Conceit that he would never go to  with his Wife when to undeceive  Idiots it is affirmed by the Learned  such Fracture may happen divers ways Accidents as well as Copulation with  viz  By extraordinary Straining viole  Coughing immoderate Sneezing stoppi  of Urine and violent motion of the Vesse  in forcibly sending down the Humou  which pressing for Passage break the  gatures  or Membrane so that the intireness or fracture of this thing commonly taken for the Virginity or Maidenhead is no absol  te sign of Dishonesty though c  rtain it isâ–ª that in Cop  lation t'is more frequent  y broke than othe  wi  e  Once at in Assize h  ld for the County of  Rutland  a Young Man was put upon Tryal of Life and Death which  yal was founded upon an I  d  ctment  for forcing a Virgin  wh  n  d  vers Quest  ons asked and the Maid swea  ing positively to the Matter naming the Time Place and Manner of the Action it was upon mature  el  b  ration resolved that she should be searched by a ski  f  l Chyrurgion and two Midwives who were to make their Report upon their Oaths which after due Examination they accordingly did affirm that the Membranes were intire and not dilacerated and that it was their Opinion for that Reason that her Body had not been penetrated which so far wrought upon the Jury that the Prisoner was acquitted a  d the Maid afterward confessed she swore against him o  t of Revenge because he had promised to marry her and then declined it And thus much concerning Virginity And now I shall proceed to the s  cond Particular which is  Reader  to shew you the Opinions of divers learned Men in relation to nature's  Operation in changing Sexes in the Womb  This Point is of much necessity by reason of the different Opinions of Men relating to it Therefore before any thing positive can be asserted it will be altogether convenient to recite what has been delivered as well in the Negative as the Affirmative And first of the first  Severus Plinius  who argues for the Negatives writes thusâ–ª The Genital parts saith he of both Sexes are one so unlike other in  Substance Composition Situation Figure Action  and  Vse  that nothing is more unequal and by how much more all other parts of the Body the Breast excepted which in Women swell more because of their secondary Use have an exact Resemblance so much the more in Resemblance are the Genital Parts of one Sex compared with the other unalike and if their Figure be thus differentâ–ª much more is their Use The Venerial Ap  petite also proceeds from different Causes for in Men it proceeds from a Desire of Emission and in Women from a Desire o  Completion in Women also the chief  of those Parts are concave and apt to re  ceive but in Men they are only por  and in a Woman solid  These things considered I cannot bu  wonder added he how any one can imagine that the Genital Member of Femal  Births should be changed into those that be  ong to Males since by those parts only  he difference and distincton of Sexes is made nor can I well impute the reason of  his vulgar Error to any thing but the mi  ake of unexpert Midwife who have  een deceived by the evil confirmation of  he parts which in some Male Births may  ave happened to have had some small protrusion not to have been discerned as  ppear'd by the Example of a Child Christened at  Paris  by the name of  Joan  as fit had been a Girl when as afterwards  proved a Boy and on the contrary the overfar extension of the  Clytoris  in Female Births may have occasioned the like mi  akes Thus far  Plyny  proceeds in the Ne  ative yet notwithstanding his Negation  here are not wanting divers learned Phy  cians that have asserted the Affirmative of which number  Galen  is one  A Man  saith    is different from a Woman in nothing  se but having his Genital Members without  Body  And this is certain That if Na  re having formed a Man would convert  im into a Woman she hath no other Task to perform but to turn his Genital Members inward and a Woman into a Man  y doing the contrary but this is to be  nderstood of the Child when it is in the Womb and not perfectly formed for divers  times Nature hath made a Femal  Child and it has so remained in the Belly o  the Mother for a Month or two and after  wards plenty of Heat increasing in the Ge  nital Members upon some oceasion they have issued forth and the Child has becom  a Male yet retaining some certain Gestures unbefitting the Masculine Sex as Femal  Actions a shrill Voice and more feeble tha  ordinary Contrariwise Nature havin  often made a Male and cold Humour flowing to it the Genitals have been in  verted yet still retaining a Manlike Fa  shion both in Voice and Gesture  Now these Opinions consider'd I am ra  ther inclinable to believe the latter as thing altogether probable for there is no  that vast difference between the Member of the two Sexes as  Pliny  would have  believe there is for the Woman has in manner the same Members with the  tho' they appear not outwardly but  inverted for the conveniency of Generat  on the main difference being that one more solid than the other and that th  chief reason of changing Sexes is and mu  be attributed to heat or cold suddenly  slowly contracted which operates accord  ing to its greater or lesser Force And th  much for these two particulars leavin  which I shall proceed to lay down season  ble  and necessary Instructions or directions for Midwives  c  opening in that Discourse a Cabinet of many rare Secrets not vulgarly known and indeed only fitting to be known to such as may observe and put  hem in practice for the publick Good and  n no wise convert them to obscenity  CHAP XI A Midwife how she ought to be qualified  THose that undertake this great Task ought by no means to enter upon it rashly or un+advisedly but with all imaginable Caution well weighing and preconsidering that she is  ccountable for all the Mischief that befalls  rough her wilful Ignorance or Neglects  herefore let not unskilful Women take upon  hem this Office barely upon pretence of their Maturity of Years and Childbearing for in such for the most part there are divers things wanting that ought to be observed which is the Occasion so many Women and Children are lost Now as for a Midwife in relation to her Person these things ought to be observed  viz  She must not be too old nor too young neither  xtraordinary fat nor weakned by leanness  ut in a good habit of Body not subject to Diseases Fear nor sudden Frights her Body  wellshaped and neat in her Attire her Hand  smooth  and  small  her Nails ever pared short not suffering any Rings to be upon Fingers during the time she is doing her Office nor any thing upon her Wrists that may obstruct and to these ought to be added Activity and a convenient Strength with much Caution and Diligence no  subject to  Drowsiness  nor  Impatience    As for her Manners she ought to be courteous affable sober chaste and not subject to Passion bountiful and compassionate to the Poor and not covetous wher  she attends upon the Poor and not covetous when she attends upon the Rich  Her Temper Chearful and Pleasant tha  she may the better comfort her Patients i  their Afflictions no  must she at any tim  make overmuch haste though her Bus  ness be urgent in another Place left by en  dangering the Mother or Child she disgrac  her self and forfeit Heaven's blessing upo  her Endeavours for the future  Of Spirit she ought to be prudent wa  and cunning but above all to have th  Fear of God before her Eyes and to em  ploy the Talent he has lent her to  Glory  CHAP XII Things worthy to be observed by Midwives tending to their Advancement and what they ought to avoid  c  LET her that undertakes this Office attended with many Circumstances of Danger and Disgrace take good heed to what I shall relate In the first place let her be diligent to leave nothing unsearched which may be advantagious to her  Practice  never imagining her self so perfect but she may add to her Knowledge by Study and Experience yet never let her apply any Remedies in that Case unless she has try'd them or known them try'd with Success or at least is conscious of their Force that they will do no harm doing nothing in that nature to practice upon Poor or Rich but speaking freely of what she knows and giving Reason for the further Confirmation thereof by no means daring to give directions for such Medicine as will cause Abortion to pleasure those that have unlawfully conceived which to do is a high degree of wickedness and may be ranked with Murtherâ–ª but if any come to her with specious Pretences let her send them to able Physicians and neither for fair Words nor  lucre be won to hearken to them If she be sent for let her know to whom she goes and be careful therein lest by laying any one that has an inf  ctious Disease as the Pox  c  she get it and so spoil other Women as a Midwife once did who laying a Strumpet that had an inveterate Pox which occasioning a Bubo  upon her right Hand and she not leaving off her Calling spoiled divers Women not the Women only but the Men also to whom it was communicated by their Wives which made them think hard of each other and for a long time could not imagine how it happened but at last it was discovered by an able Physician and the Midwife for ever after debarr'd her Practice and not so only but follow'd with Curses even to her grave She must likewise observe that she entertains no greatbelly'd Women at Bed and Board in her House lest thereby she bring a Scandal upon her self and so lose her Practice If the Birth at any time be hard and difficult she must not be dismayed but chear up the Woman and try her utmos  Skill to make the Labour easie Directions for which shall hereafter be inserted nor must she ever think of any thing but doing well and using her utmost Skill causing all necessary things that are proper for the Work Consolation of the Woman and  Reception of the Child to be in a readiness and above all let her use her diligence either by perswasion or otherwise to keep the Woman from being unruly in her Pangs lest thereby she destroy both her self and her Child and not in any wise to proceed too hastily in her Business but wait God's leisure in all things and by no means let her suffer her Wits to scatter by dismay or doubt if things go not well for fear it disorders the Senses and a Person that keeps her Wits together is capable of giving Assistance in weighty Affairs for when we are most at a Plunge then there is most need of Prudence to set things right And seeing she can never be an expert Midwife that has no farther Knowledge than of the external Parts I shall not think it amiss briefly with modesty to proceed in describing the generative Part of a Woman as they have been anatomized by the Learned of the present and past Ages and shew the Use of such Vessels  c  as are contributing Generation  CHAP XIII Of the Genitals of Women External and Internal to the Vessels of the Womb  WAS it not for the benefit of Practitioners and Professors of the Art of Midwifry I should above all things spare to treat of these particulars because they may be turned by some Lascivious and lewd Persons into ridicule but they being absolutely necessary to be known I will hope the best and proceed in order  The parts that offer themselves to view without any Deduction at the bottom of th  Belly are the  Fiss  ra Magna  or the Great Chink with its  Libia  or Lips the  M  ns Veneris  and the Hair These parts are called by the general Name of  Pudend  because when they are bared they bring  Pud  r  or Shame upon a Woman The  Fissura magna  reaches from the lower part of  Os Pubis  to within an Inch of the  Anus  It is less and closer in Maids than in those that have born Children and has two Lips which towards the  Pubes  grow thicker and more full or preturbe  ant and meeting upon the middle of the  Os Pubis  make that rising that is called  Mons Veneris  or the Hill of  Venus    The next things that offer are the  Nymphae  and  Clytoris  the former of which is of a membrany and filmy Substance spongy softâ–ª and partly fleshy being of a bloody Colour in the shape of Wings two in number though from their Rise they are joined in an acute Angle p  oducing there a fleshy Substance which cloaths the  Clyeoris  and many times they spread so  a  that incision is required to make way for the Man's Instrument of Generation  The  Clytoris  is a substance in the upper Part of the  Division  where the two Wings concur and is the S  at of  Venereal  Pleasure being like a Yard in Situation Substance Composition and Erection growing sometimes out of the Body two Inches but that never happens unless thro' extream Lust or extraordinary Accident But to proceed this  Clytoris  consists of two spongy and skinny Bodies containing a distinct Original from the  Pubis  Bone the Head of it being covered with a tender Skin having a hole or passage like the  Penis  or Yard of a Man though not quite through in which and the bigness it only differs from it  The next things in course are the Fleshy Knobs and the gr  at Neck of the Womb And these  Knobs  are behind the Wings bein four in number much resembling MyrtleBerries being placed in Quadrangle  one against the other and in this Place i  incerted to the Orifice of the Bladder which opens it self into the Fissure to eva  cuate the Urine for securing of which from Cold or the like inconveniency one o  these Knobs are placed before it and shut  up the Passage  The Lips of the Womb that next ap  pear being separated disclose the Neck thereof in which two things are to be observed  viz  The Neck it self and the  Hymen  but more properly the  Claustrum Virginale  of which I have before discoursedâ–ª But the Neck of the Womb is to be understood the Channel that is between th  aforesaid Knobs and the inner Bone o  the Womb which receives the  Penis  like a Sheath and that it may the better be dilated for the Pleasure of Procreation the  Substance  of it is  Sinew  and a little  Spongy  and in this  Concavity  are divers Folds o  Orbicular Pl  ghts made by Tunicles wrinkled like an expanded Rose in Virgins they plainly appear but VVomen that have been used often in Copulation they are extinguished so that the inner side o  the Wombs Neck appears smooth and i  old VVomen it becomes more hard and grislyâ–ª And now note that although thi  Channel be sometimes writhed and crooked sinking down yet in the time of Copulation  Labour or the monthly Purgations and is erected and extended which overextension occasioneth the great Pain in Childbirth  The  Hymen  or  Claustrum Virginale  is that which closes the Neck of the Womb being as I have before cited in the Chapter relating to Virginity broken in the first Copulation its use being rather to stay the untimely Courses in Virgins than to any other end and commonly when 'tis broke in Copulation or by any other Accident a small quantity of Blood flows with some between the Duplicity of the  two Tunicles  which constitute the Neck of the Womb there are many Ve  ns and Arteries running along and arising from the Vessels descending on both sides the  Thighs  and passing into the  Neck  of the  Womb  being extreamly large and the reason of their Largeness is for that the Neck of the Bladder requires to be filled with abundance of Spirit thereby to be extend  d and d  lated for its better taking hold of the  Penis  â–ª great Heat being required in such motions which becoming more Intense by the Act of Fri  ation does consume a considerable  uantity of Moisture in supplying which large Vessels are altogether necessary  Another Cause of the Longness of those Vessels there is  viz  by Reason the  Mense  have their Way through them which often occasion Women with Child to continue their Purgations for although the Womb is shut up yet the Passage in the Neck of the Womb through which these Vessels pass are open In this Cause there is further to be observedâ–ª that as soon as you penetrate the  Pude  dum  there appears two little Pits or Holes wherein is contained an Humour which by being expunged in the time of Copulation greatly delights the Woman  CHAP XIV A Description of the Wombs Fabrick the preparing Vessels and Testicles in Women as also of the deferent or ejaculatory Vessels  c  IN the lower part of the Hypogastrion where the Hips are widest and broadest they being greater and broader thereabouts than those of Men which is the reason they have likewise broader Buttocks than Men is the Womb joined to its Neck and is placed between the Bladder and strait Gut which keeps it from swaying or rowling yet give it liberty to stretch and dilate it self and again to contract as Nature in that case disposes it Its Figure is in a manner round and not unlike a Gourd lessening a little and growing more acute toward one end being knit together by its proper Ligaments its Neck likewise is joined by its  own Substance  and certa  n Membranes that fasten it to  Os Sacrum  and the Sharebone As to its largeness that much differs in Woman especial  y the Difference is great between such as  ave born Children and such as have  orn none In Substance it is so thick that  exceeds a Thumbs Breadth which after Conception it is so far from decreasing  that it augments to a greater Proportion and the more to strengthen and confirm it it is interwoven with Fibres overthwart strait and winding and its proper Vessels are Veins Arteries and Nerves and amongst these are two little Veins which pass from the Spermatick Vessels to the Bottom of the Womb and two larger from the Hypogastricks which visit both the Bottom and the Neck the Mouth of these Veins piercing as far as the inward Concavity  The  Womb  hath also two  Arteries  on both sides the  Spermatick Vessels  and the  Hypogastricks  which still attend or accompany the Veins and besides these there are divers little Nerves and intwined in the Form of a Net which extend throughout even from the Bottom to the  Pudenda  themselves being chiefly placed for Sense and Pleasure moving in Sympathy between th  Head and Womb  Now it is to be farther noted that b  reason of two Ligaments that hang on ei  ther side of the  Womb  from the Sharebone and piercing through the  Peritonaeum  an  are joyned to the Bone it self that th  Womb  is moveable upon sundry Occasions often falling low or rising high as for th  Neck of Womb  it is of an exquisite Feel  ing so that if it be any time out of Order  by being troubled with a schirrous Brawn Overfatnessâ–ª Moisture or Relaxation the Womb is subjected thereby to Barrenness In those that are with Child there frequently stays a most glutinous Matter in the Entrance to facilitate the Birth for at the time of Delivery the  Mouth  of the  Womb  is opened in a strange Manner to such a Wideness as is conformable to the bigness of the Child suffering an equal Dilation from the Bottom to the Top  As for the  Preparatery  or  Spermatick Vessels  in Women they are made of two Veins and Arteries not differing from those in a Man but only in their  largeness  and  manner of Insertion  for as to their Number there are so many Veins and the like  proportion of Arteries  as in Men the Right Vein issuing from the trunk of the hollow Vein descending and the left from the emulgent Vein and on the side of them are two Arteries which grow from the  Aorta    As to the  Longitude  and  Latitude  of these Vessels they are narrow and shorter in Women than in Men only observe where they are wrinkled or crumpled they are more wreathed and con  orted than in Men as shrinking together by reason of their shortness they may by their Loosness be the better stretched out when Occasion requires it And these Vessels in Women  are carried on with an oblique Course thro' the leser Guts to the Testicles or Stones but are in the midway divided into two Branches the greater going to the Stones constitu  ing the various or windy Body and wonderful Inoculating the lesser Branch end  ng in the Womb in the side of which it d  sperseth it self and c  iefly at the higher Part of the bottom of the Womb for the Nourishment thereof and that part of the Courses may purge through these Vessels and seeing the Testicles in Women are seated near the Womb for that cause these Vessels fall not from the  Peritonaeum  neither make they such Passages as in Men nor extend themselvs to the Sharebone  The Stones in Women commonly called the Testicles perform not the same Action as Men they are also different in their Situation Magnitude Temperament Substance Form and Covering As for their Seat it is in the Hollowness of the  Abdomen  neither are they extreamly pendulous but rest upon the Muscles of the Loins that so they may by contracting the greater heat be more fruitful their Office being to contain the  Ova  or  Eggs  which being impregnated by the Man's Seed ingender Man yet they Differ from those of Men in Figure by reason of their lessness  or flatness at either end not being so  ound or Oval The External Superficies being likewise more unequal appearing like the Composition of a great many Knots and Kernels mixed together there is also another difference in their Substance they being much more soft and pliable loose not so well compacted  Their magnitude and temparament being also different for they are much colder and lesser then those in Men as for their covering or inclosure it likewise differs ex+treamly for as Men's are wrapped or covered in divers Tunicles by reason they are externally Pendulous and subject to divers Injuries unless so fenced by Nature so Womens Stones being internal and less subject to casualty are covered with one Tunicle or Membrance the which though it closely adhere to them yet are they likewise half covered with the  Peritonaeum    The Different or Ejaculatory Vessels are two obscure Passages and on either side nothing differing from the Spermatick Veins in substance rise they do on one part from the bottom of the Womb not  eaching from the other extremity either to the Stones or any other part but shut up and unpassable adhering to the Womb as the Colon does to the blind Gut and winding half way about the Testicles  are every way remote to them yet though they touch them not they are tied to them by certain Membranes resembling the Wings of a Bat or Fluttermouse through which certain Veins and Arteries passing from the End of the Testicles in these beginning or may be termed here to have their Passages proceeding from the Corners of the Womb to the Testicle  and are accounted the proper Ligament  by which the Testicles and Womb are united and strongly knit together and these Ligaments in Women are the Cremesters in Men of which I shall speak more largely when I come to describ  the Masculine parts conducing to Generation  CHAP XV A Discourse of the Vse and Action of the several Parts in Women appropriated to Generation  c  THE Externals commonly called the  Pudenda  are designed to cover the great Orifice and that to receive the  Penis  or Yard in the  act of Co  tion  and give Passage to the  Birth  and  Vrine  The use of the Wings and Knobs like Mirtleberries are for the security of the Internal parts shutting the  Orifice  and  Neck  of the  Bladder  and by their swelling up cause  Titulation  in those  parts  and also to obstruct the  unvoluntary Passage  of the Urine  The Action of the  C  ftoris  in Women is like that of the  Penis  in Men  viz  Erection and its outer end is like the  Glans  of the  Penis  viz and has the same Name And as the  Glans  in Man is the Seat of the greatest Pleasure in Copulation so is this in Women whence 'tis called  Amoris dulcedo  and  Aestum Veneris    The Action and Use of the Neck of the Womb is also equal with that of the  Penis viz  Erection occasioned divers ways First in case of Copulation it is erected and made strait for the Passage of the  Penis  to the Womb Secondly Whilst  the Passage is repleated with Spirit and  Vital Blood  it becomes more strait for embracing the  Penis  as for the Convenience of Erection it is twofold  First  Forasmuch as if the  Neek  of the  Womb  was not erected the  Yard  could have no convenient Passage to the  Womb Secondly  It hinders any hurt or damage that might ensue through the violent Concussion of the  Yard  during the time of  Copulation    As for the Vessels that pass thro' the  Neck  of the Womb their Office is to repleat it with  Blood  and  Spirit  that still as the Moisture consumes the Heat contracted there in  Copulation  it may by those Vessels be renewed But their principal Business is to convey Nutriment to the Womb  The  Womb  it self has many Properties attributed to it as  First  Retention of the fecundated Egg which is properly called  Conception    Secondly  To cherish and nourish it til by the help of Nature it has framed the Child and brought it to Perfection And then it strongly operates in sending forth the Birth when the time of its remaining there is expired dilating and spreading it self in a wonderful Manner And indeed is the Field of Man's Generation being designed for no other Purpose and so aptly  removed from the Senses that nothing of Injury can proceed from thence retaining in it self a Power and Strength to operate and cast forth the Bi  th unless by Accident or the like it be rendred deficient When to strengthen and enable it besides the Helps of Nature sundry Remedies are to be applied by skilful Hands Direction For which shall be hereafter mentioned  The Use of the preparing Vessels is this The Arteries convey the  Blood  to the  Testicles  where part of it is spent in the nourishment of them and the Production of those little Bladders which do in all things resemble Eggs through which the  Vasa Praeparantia  run and are obliterate in them And as for the Veins their Office is only to bring back what  Blood  remains from the uses aforesaid  The Vessels in this kind are much shorter in Women than in Men by reason of their  nearness  to the  Stones  which Defect is yet legthenned and made good by the many Intricacies or Windings to which those Vessels are subject for in the middle Way they drive themselves into two Branches tho' different in Magnitude for one being greater than the other passes by the Stone  The Stones in a Woman are very useful for when they are defective Generation  is at an end for altho' those little Bladders which are on their outward Superficies contain nothing of Seed as the followers of  Galen  and  Hipocrates  did erroneously imagine yet they contain several Eggs commonly to the number of twenty in each Testicle one of which being impregnated by the most spirituous part of the Man's Seed in the Act of Coition descends through the  Oviducts  into the Womb and from thence in process of time becomes a living Child  Their Figure is not exactly round but flat and dispersed on the sides in their lower part Oval but in their upper where the BloodVessels enter them more plain and have but one Membrane to encompass 'em probably that the Heat may have the easier Access  CHAP XVI Of Conception and the Infallible Signs thereof as also whether it be a Male or Female that is conceived or both at once commonly called Twins  THE next thing convenient to be observed in this Treat  se and as it falls in course is Conception and its Symptoms very material and worthy  more not only by  but all  oung Women N  w the signs of  onception three or four days after convenient and satisfactory are  Pains  n the Head Vertigo and Dimness of the Eye  the Apple  the Eyes  crease the Eyes themselves swell and become of a dull or dark colour the  Veins wax  ng red and shut with Blood Again if the Eyes sink or Eyebrows grow loose various colours appear in the Eyes and little red Pimples suddenly arise in the Face and almost as suddenly disappear Thirdly if the Veins between the Eyes and Nose are extended with Blood the Veins under the Tongue look greenish the Neck flusheth with heat the Backbone cold the Veins and Arteries swell and the Pulses are observed more easily Fourthly if  the Veins in the Breast appear Blackish and afterwards turn yellow the Teats look fiery and upon drinking cold Drink the woman feels it as it were in her Breast Fifthly If she on a sudden fall to loathing her Meat and Drink coveting thing  unreasonably and not fit for Sustenance be troubled with Pukings weakness of Stomach sore declining and there be little Worms found about the Navel Sixthlyâ–ª If the lower part of the Belly swell and weakness be contracted in her Loins with inward Gripings and retention of the Courses days after Copulation After which  act  there is a cold and trembling seizes on the Members External Seventhly it is a certain sign of Conception if the Midwife putting up her finger find the Interior Neck of the Womb exactly closed If the womb wax round and swell the Courses stay the Thighs swell with some pain the whole Body grows Weak the Face at times becomes Pale the Urine white with a little Cloud after some standing at the top of it if many Atoms appear in itâ–ª Eightly If Urine be put in a Glass three days and the Woman have conceived certain live things will appear to stir in it If a bright Needle be put in a whole Night and she have conceived divers little red Specks will be thereon but if not it will  be blackish or rusty Nor are these Imaginations but the proved Assertions of the Learned in Physick and Skilful in Midwifry who have made it their Study to search into the Depths of Natures Secrets And next comes a nicer Point to be treated of not without the Patronage of such whose Wisdom and in  efatigable Labour have rendred them famous to Posterity The which take as followeth  After Conception and the Child be come  o some Perfection so that the Sex may be distinguished if it happen to be a MaleChild then the Right Eye of the Women will to appearance move swifter and sparkle more than the Left The right Pap will rise swell and be more hard than the left and the Teats colour will change more suddenly and the Increase of the Milk will be speedy and if it be milked out and set in the Sun it will look like Pearl contracting it self into a more solid Matter than ordinary or if upon milking it out you cast it upon the Womans Urine  will sink to the Bottom Her Right Cheek will often glow and be more ruddy than the Le  t and indeed the whole colour of the Face more lively than at other times she feels less Sadness than if she Conceived a Female And when first the Child stirs it is more brisk and strong in its Motion  than the other having commonly its first Motion on the right side on the th Day if her Courses flow the th Day after Conception if her Belly be more acute towards the Navel and as she goes she puts her Right Leg foremost and rising observe to ease her self on the Right Side more than on the Left  Now in case a Female be conceived the tokens are averse to those for the most part the first Motion rarely happening before the th day after Conception and then it is made on the left Side Females are carried with more Pains than Males thro' Defect of Heat in the Womb to attract the Substance also the Thighs and Genital Members of the Woman swell more than ordinary her Colour departs and her Longings are extream and her Courses flow the Thirtieth Day after Conception  If Twins are conceived which many times happens thro' the Impregnating o  two Eggs at the same time the sign thereof will not appear till the third or fourth Month after Conception and then the first Appearance will be by the Motion of the Infants both ways that is on either side of the Womb at once for they receive their Souls at one and the same time also if her two Flanks swell higher than the middle of the Belly if there does appea  a Line or as it were a Division from the Navel to the Groin making a kind of a Channel or if a Woman with more than ordinary Pain support her Burthen And thus much may suffice for these from whence I shall proceed to give the Reader  Insight into false Conceptions that frequently deceive Women especially such as  re overdesirous of Children  CHAP XVII Of false Conceptions and how to know them  HAving already treated of true Conceptions the next thing noteworthy  what relates to false Conceptions and  n this case Women are sometimes deluded  hinking themselves with Chiid when their Bellies only swell with the Retention of their Natural Purgationsâ–ª that fall not according to their usual times Or else by a Lump of indigested Flesh for the most  rt like the Gizzard of a Fowl greater or  esser according to the time of its continuance there which is frequently four Months and is called a  MoonCalf    At other times they are deceived by Moles which are twofold  viz  The true and a false the former of which is fleshy Body filled with many Ve  els streaked  with white green or black Lines  deficient of Membranes but encompasse with divers yet without Growth Motio  Bones Bowels or any Internals receivi  its nourishment thro' certain Vessels no  withstanding it l  es as we may say th  life of a Plant without any  Figu  e  or  Ord  ingendred in the Concavity of the Matrix It has no Burthen or Navelstring fastned  it as a Child always has forasmuch as  Mole it self adheres to the Womb by whic  means it receives  Nourishment  from it  Vessels  The latter of these  viz  The false Mol  may be divided into four distinctions as fo  lowing First the windy Mole being contraction or conflux of wind Sec  ndl  the watery Mole being a Gathering  Water Thirdly the Humorous Mole  conflux of divers Humours and Fourthl  the membranous Mole being many Mem  branes in the Form of a Bag filled wi  Blood and of these in their Order  Galen  holdeth that the Mole is bred whe  the Man's Seed is weak barren imperfect or too little in quantity and for the mo  part choaked through the abundance of th  menstruous Blood which is gross thic  and unfit for the Framing of a Child  that instead thereof is bred a lump of Fles  that by little and little increaseth bein  wrapped in its own Membrane whic  Nature effecteth as desirous to bring forth any thing rather than be idle  The windy Mole is occasioned through defect of Heat in the Womb and parts adjacent as the Liver and Spleen which ingender a polite or windy Vapour which fills the membranous Part and puffs up the Concavity of the Matrix  The watry Mole is ingendred of divers apt confluences of thin Matter or watry Fluxes which passing thro' the Vessels evacuates into the Womb having its Original from the Spleen Liver or parts adjoyning or rather it proceeds from the weakness of the Matrix which cannot assimilate the Blood that  s brought to nourish it part whereof  s turned into Water and not being avoided stayeth in the Womb  The Humorous Mole is ingendred by moist attracted Humours as the Whites or certain watry Purgation which distil from the menstruous Veins and gathering into a glutinous Substance stay in the concavity of the Womb  The Membranous Mole is no other than a contraction of Blood within a Skin or Membrane to which is fastened many white and transparent Vessels filled with Blood the which coming forth and being thrown into Water the Blood goeth outâ–ª and the Membrane rumples together  shrinking on a Heap like coagulate  Seed  Now mow most or all of these  Concepti  ons  have many  Signs  or  Symptoms  coheren  with the true as the Depravity of Appe  tite Puking Swelling Suppression of th  Menses  Swelling of the Brest and Belly so that many are at a plunge to distinguish them for indeed it is not easily to be done though in these following Matters there i  distinction  viz  In case of a  false Conception  the Breasts swell and fall again not con  taining any Milk the Face is frequently puffed up the Arms the Groin and th  Thighs grow meagre and lanker the Bel  ly waxes hard as if Dropsical being al  most of an equal Roundness with many Prickings at the bottom scarcely admitting of Intermission which breaks the Rest o  the Woman so afflicted divers other sign there are to know it by especially the tru  or fleshy Mole as thus a MaleInfant be  gins to move at the beginning of the third Month for the most part and the Femal  at the end of the third or beginning o  the fourth Now when any motion happens the Woman ought to consider whe  ther she has any Milk in her Breasts if sh  have it is a sign of a  true Conception  bu  the contrary of a  false one  it is also th  Sign of a  true Conception  if the Chil  move freely and lively in all parts of the  Womb  for although there is a Motion in a  false Conceeption  yet it is dull and not quick nor active in Motion the Motion not being in it self but in the expulsive Faculty of the  Mother  And further if the  Woman  observe she may perceive it fall always to the side she lies on and she lying on her Back if her Belly be stroaked down the Burthen will descend and not have for want of inbred Force Power to recover its Station But what confirms it more is that nine Months expired no Travel ensues but her Belly still increasesâ–ª whilst all the rest of the Body grows lean and out of order  The Signs of the Windy Mole are divers as the sudden stretching of the Belly like a Bladder yet soft and spungy especially near the Groins and swelling thereof when if it be struck it sounds like a Drum and that the swelling is sometimes more and sometimes less so that according to its Increase and Decrease the  Woman  feels more heavy or more light  The Watry Mole is known by its Distention of the Belly and especially when she lies upon her Back the sides thereof are more swelled than the middle or the bottom which grows flatter by reason the watry humour falls to the sides moving up and down as if it were a fluctuation o  Water and much to the same purpose a  the Symptoms of the  Humorous Mole  only with the Distinction that the Flanks and Thighs are more stretched by the Watery Mole than by the other because the Water being thinner than the Humour or not confined in Cells flows thither and that which in case of a watery Mole comes through Nature's Conduit is clear when in case of a humorous Mole the Water is red and of a Blood Colour  Further observe in case of a  false Conception  the Courses come not down and the Navel of the  Mother  advanceth it self little or nothing which in the true  Conception  is otherwise  Other  false Conceptions  there are occasioned by divers Tumours which the Ignorant take for Moles when they are only Rotundities and Swelling the Belly which are not discovered till the Womb be opened and then though the Womb be not all out of order there does appear at one or both  corners  thereof little  ags full of Water in others there are to be seen a Heap of Kernels or superfluous Flesh like a Cluster of Grapes in the Womb causing it to swell Yet in such Cases the Courses are observed to proceed in due order which denotes the  Womb  to be in good Order  Another Excrescency of Flesh there is  which some call a  Pendant Mole  being a peice of fleshy Substance hanging within the interior Neck of the Womb being in breadth about a finger at the Place where it is fastned increasing bigger and bigger towards the bottom like a small Bell possessing the whole Orifices nay sometimes appearing outward to a great bigness  CHAP XVIII Instructions for Women how to govern themselves during their being with Child  THese Instructions being exceeding necessary I thought fit to lay them down for a Rule to such as are desirous of Selfpreservation And indeed for want of due Observance divers Diseases afflict Childbearing Women nay the Child is frequently lost or if it come to a perfect Birth proves sickly and disordered through the Mother's Misobservance  In the first place then the  Woman  with Child ought to chuse a temperate Air not affected with Fogs arising from Marshes Ditches Ponds Lakes or Rivers and not to go abroad in too hot nor too cold Weather nor when the  Southwind  blows  strong  for that Wind above all others dis  rbs and disorders  Women with Child  oftentimes  causing Abortion And next to it the  Northwind  is hurtful causing  Catarrhs Coughs  and  Rheums  which opening the Body causes the  Woman  to bring forth before her time In short if any evil Vapour be drawn in during Purgancy it causes divers Diseases  In case of Diet she ought to be very cautious in chusing such Meats as create wholsom nourishment all Meats that are moderately dry being taken so to do and let her observe not to fast immoderately for that renders the Child sickly and weak and often for want of nourishment constrains it to be born before its time nor on the other hand must she be too gluttonous for that again stuffs it and causes it to swell beyond its natural Bounds  All Meats either too hot or too cold and moist are to be avoided as Salads Spiced meats and the extraordinary Use of other Meats which makes the Children come forth oftentimes without Nails which is a Sign of short Life The most wholsom Meats in this case are Pidgeons Turtles Larks Partridges Pheasants Veal Mutton or any such Meat that is of good Juice and contributing to kindly Nourishment as also such Fruits as are sweet and of easy Digestion as  Cherries Pears Damsons  c but let her avoid such things as subject her Body to Windiness  Her Longings if extravagant she must restrain at least as much as in her lies not eating any thing that is filthy or contrary to Nourishment nor let her sleep immediately after Meals and not at all in the Daytime if she can avoid it the Night being preferable in such cases when she may sleep her fill so it exceed not nine hours  Her Exercise ought to be moderate for  violent motion  either in Walking or otherwise  molests  and  disturbs  the  Womb  Riding in a Coach especially upon the Stones or in uneven Way the last three Months are dangerous as also extraordinary Sounds or Noises and above all the Ringing of Bells and Discharging of Guns  Laughing Crying or immoderate Anger or any other Passion is extreamly hurtful nor in the first four Months after  Conception  ought she to lie with her Husband forasmuch as the Act of  Copulation  moves and shakes the  Womb  and consequently the Fruit therein and causes the Courses to descend She must likewise in the  th  and  th Month  abstain but in the  th  and  th  it is not forbidden but rather to be encouraged by reason as Physicians affirm it opens the Passage and thereby facilitates the Birth and the better to help it the  Woman  ought to take such things as may keep her  ody soluble as Syrrups and other loosening  matters as may help Nature in its Operation especially let her observe when she grows any thing big to lay aside her Busk and go loose that the Child may have free Scope for two Reasons  First  That it may not be hurt and  Secondly  That it being unrestrained may come to its full Growth  CHAP XIX Further Considerations how Women ought to govern themselves during Pregnancy  TIS further to be observed that after Delivery the Breasts frequently grow extream large and swell overmuch to prevent which and to avoid the Danger of too much Blood which causes curdled or crudy Milk so that from the Effects thereof divers Diseases arise in the Breast so soon as the Woman perceives her self with Child let her wear about the Neck a small Necklace of Gold or Steel or a small Ingot of the latter to hang between her two Breasts fomenting her Breasts a quarter of an hour every morning with Water distilled from SagePerewinkle GroundIvy being bloodwarm  In her  fourth Month  when the  Motion  is great and her Belly swells big she may  wath it with a Swathband annointed  with  Pomatum  or the like to make which I shall give direction and in so doing she will keep it smooth and free from wrinkles as also from hanging down like a Tripe after Delivery  The Receipt  Take of the Gall of a Kid and of a Sow of each    ounces and Capons grease and Goose grease of each one Ounce and an half and having melted them put thereto a quarter of a Pint of Water after which strain them through a Linnen Cloth into fair Water casting it to and fro therein till it be white at what time add to it the Marrow of a Red Deer one Ounceâ–ª and lay it in RedRoseWater    hours after the expiration of which you may use it in anointing the Swath as aforesaid as also the Belly  If the Ingredients aforesaid cannot be gotten then the following Leniments are effectual though the former is better  viz  Take of MuttonSuet adjoining to the Kidne  s and Dogsgrease each two ounces WhaleOil an ounce and of SweetAlmondOil the like Quantity wash them well after they are melted together in the Water of Germander or new Whitewine and an  int the Belly therewith or the Swa  hband ordained to support it  But for such as are not desirous to anoint their Bellies may use the following  Bath  or  Decoction  Take of all the so  ts of Mallow and of Motherwort each two handfuls LillyRoots the white ones to the weight of three Ounces Melilot and Camomile of both two handfulsâ–ª Limeseeds Quinceseed  and Fenugreeckseed  three Ounce proportionable of each boil them in SpringWater and bathe therewith  If the Woman during her Pregnancy feel but little  Motion  in her  Womb  let her make a  u  lt as followeth and bind it upon her Navelâ–ª and it will greatly strengthen Infant  viz  Take the Powd  er of Roses Red Coral and Gilliflowers of each three Ounces Mastick a Dr  m and of Angelicaseeds two Drams two grains of Ambergrise and one of Musk all which being well beaten put them into a Linnen Bag expanded and quilted that they  may  be in  every  part of it placing it upon the Navel  CHAP XX Rules to be observed upon a Womans lying down and her Delivery  c  HAving thus far proceeded in what as I conceived is highly necessary to be known by the Professors of this Art I shall gradually proceed to what remains And  First  to inform the  Reader  what is necessary to be observed upon the Woman's lying down in order to her Delivery  The Hour according to Computation of Time and the Disposition of the Body approaching let the Woman send for a skilful  Midwife not delaying so to do but rather  too soon  than  too  ate  at what time let her prepare a little Bed or Couch of a moderate Heighth and so situate that it be far from the  D  or  near the  Fire  and convenient for the Midwife and her Assistants to pass round and be  iding on every side as Occasion requires having Change of Linnen and a small Cricket or little Log of Timber to rest her Feet against she having more Force when they are bowed than otherwise  Having thus provided when the Woman feels her Pains come if the Weather be not extream cold let her walk leisurely  about the  Room  resting her self by turns upon the Bed expecting so the coming down of her Water which is a Humour that is contracted in one of the outward Membranes and flows thence when it is broke by the struggling of the Child or some other Accident there being no  direct time  affixed for its Efflux though for the most part it flows not above two hours before the Birth Motion likewise will cause the Womb to open and dilate it self when lying along in Bed will prove troublesome yet if she be much spent and weakened she may take some gentle Cordial to refresh her self if her Pains will Permit  If her Travel be tedious to revive her Spirits she may take any  Broth of Chickens  or  Mutton  and after it a poach'd Egg but must not take any thing to excess As for the Posture Women are delivered in they are divers  some  lying in their Bed  others  siting in a Chairâ–ª supported and held by others or resting upon the side of the Bed or Chair  some again  upon their Knees being supported under their Arms but the  safest  and  most cemmodious  Way is in the Bed whenas the  Midwife  ought to observe these following Rules  Let her see that the Woman be laid upon her Back her Head a little elevatedâ–ª by the help of a Pillow having the like  help to support her Reins and Buttocks and that her Rump lie high for if she lie low she cannat be well delivered then let her keep her  Knees  and  Thighs  as far asunder as she can her Legs bowed together her Buttocks the Soles of her Feet and Heels being fix'd upon a little Log of Timber placed for that purpose that she may have the greater Force to strain Now in case her  Back  be  exceeding weak  a Swathband may be cast under it the Band being four double and about Inches broad and this must be held by two Persons who with steady hands and equal motion must raise her up at the time the Pains happen but if they be not exact in their Motion 'tis better evaded and at the same time let two Women hold her Shoulders that she may the better strain out the Birth with more Advantage and the better to facilitate it let a Woman stroak or press the upper Part of her Belly gently and by degrees Nor must the Woman her self be fainthearted but couragious and of a good Heart forcing her self by straining and stopping her Breath  In case of Delivery the Midwife must wait with Patience till the Child's Head or other Members burst the Membrane for through Ignorance or haste to be gone to other Women as some have done the  Midwife tear the Membranes with her Nails she endangers both the Woman and the Child for it lying dry and wanting that Slipperiness that should facilitate it its Egress comes forth with greater Pain  When the Head appears the Midwife must gently hold it between her two hands and draw the Child at such times as the Womans Pangs are upon her and at no other slipping by degrees her four fingers under its Armpits not using a ro  gh hand in drawing it forth lest by such means the Child through its tenderness receive any Deformity of Body  As  soon  as the Child is taken forth which is commonly with its Face downwards let it be laid upon its Back that it may more freely receive External Respiration then cut the Navelstring with a sharp Instrument about three Inches from the Body tying that which adheres to the Belly with a silken string as near as you can then cover the Head and Stomach of the Child well suffering nothing to come upon the Face  The Child being thus drawn forth and in Health lay it aside and let the Midwife regard the Patient in drawing or causing to come forth the Secundine And this may be done by wagging and stirring them up and down and afterwards with a gentl  Hand drawing them forth or if the Work  be difficult let the Woman hold Salt in her Hands shut them close and breath hard into them whereby she shall know whether the said Membranes be broken or not The like may be known by causing a Strain or Vomiting by putting one Finger down her Throat by straining or moving her inferiour Parts being all observed to be done out of Hand If this fail she may take a draught of raw Elderwater or the Yolk of a raw Egg or smell to a piece of  Assa foetida  if she be troubled with the WindCholick a Remedy for which I shall hereafter prescribe If she have taken cold it is a great Obstruction to the coming down of the Secundines and in such cases the Midwife ought to chafe the Woman's Belly with a gentle Hand which breaks not only the Wind but obliges the Secundines to come down And these proving ineffectual the Midwife must dilate with her Hand the exterior Orince of the  omb and gently draw it forth Having discoursed of common Births or such as for the most part are easie I shall proced to give Directions in case of Extremity  CHAP XXI In case of Extremity what ought to be observed especially to Women who in their Travel are accompanied with an Efflux of Blood Convulsion or Fits of the Wind  IN case of Extremity greater Regard must be had than at other times and first of all the Situation of the Womb and her Posture of Lying must be cross the Bed being held by such as have Strength to prevent her slipping down or moving her self in the Operation of the Manmidwife or Chirurgeon her Thighs must be sundered as wide as may be and so held whilst her Legs invert and bend backward towards her Hips her Head leaning upon a Bolster and the Reins of her Back supported with the like her Rump and Buttocks likewise elevated observing to cover her Stomach Belly and Thighs with warm Linnen to keep them from cold Wind  The Woman being in the Posture aforesaid let the Operator put up his Hand if he finds the Neck of the Womb dilated and remove the contracted Blood that obstructs the Passage of the Birth and having by degrees with much gentleness made Way let him tenderly move the Infant  his Head being first anointed with sweet Butter or a harmless  Pomatum  and if the Waters are not come down then without any difficulty may they be let forth when if the Infant attempts to break forth with the Head foremost or cross he may gently turn it to find the Feet which having done let him draw forth one and fasten it to a Ribband then put it up again and by degrees find the other when bringing them as close and as even as may be and between whiles giving the Woman leave to breathe urging her to strain in helping Nature to perfect the Birth he may draw it forth and the better to do it that his hold may be surer he must fasten or wrap a LinnenCloth about the Child's Thighs observing to bring it into the World with its Face downward  In case of a Flux of  Blood  if the Neck of the Womb be open it must then be maturely considered whether the Infant or the Secundines come first which often the latter happening to do stop the Mouth of the  Womb  and hinder the Birth to the endangering both the Woman and Child in such a case I say the Secundine must be be removed by swift turn and indeed they have by their so coming down deceived many who feeling their Softness supposed the Womb was not dilated and by their  being so deceived the Woman and Child or at least the latter has been lost the Secundines removed the Child must be sought for and drawn forth as has been directed and if in such a case the Woman or Child die the Midwife or Chirurgeon is blameless because they did their true Endeavour  If it appear upon  Enquiry  that the  Secundine  comes first let the Woman be delivered with all convenient Expedition because great flux of Blood will follow for then the Veins are opened and upon this Account two things are to be considered  First  the  bigness  or  smallness  of the  Secundines  advancing if the former and the Head of the Child appear first it must be guided and directed towards the Neck of the Womb as in Case of Natural Births but if there thro' the Weakness of the Child or Mother appear any Difficulty in the Delivery the best Way is to search for the Feet and thereby draw it forth but if the latter the  Secundines  may be put back with a gentle Hand and the Child first taken forth  Another matter is more worthy  viz  If the  Secundine  be far advanced so that it cannot be put back and the Child follow it close then are the  Seundines  to be taken forth with much Care as swift as may be and laid aside without cutting the Entail that is fastned to them for by that you  may be guided to the Infant the which whether alive or dead must be drawn  orth by the Feet with all Expedition tho'  t is not to be acted unless in case of great Necessity for in other cases the Secundine  ught to come last  As for a dead Child in drawing it forth  et these directions be carefully observed by  he Chirurgeon  viz  if the Child be found  tead with its Head foremost the danger is  he greater and more difficult will be the Delivery for it is an apparent Sign the Woman's Strength begins to fail her and  hat the  Child  being  dead  and wanting its  bred Force can be no Ways assisted to  ts Delivery wherefore the most certain  nd safe way is for the Chirgeon to put up  his  lets hand  sliding it as hollow in the  Palm  s he can into the Neck of the Womb in  o the lower part thereof towards the Feet  nd that between the Head of the Infant and the Neck of the Matrix when having a Hook in the right Hand chuch it close and slip it up above the Left Hand between the Head of the Child and the  lat of his hand fixing it in the bone of the Temple towards the Eye or else in the hollow of the Eye or for want of conveniently coming at these in the occipital Bone observing still to keep the left hand in its place with it gently moving and  stirring the Head and so with the Righ  Hand and Hook draw the Child forwar  admonishing the Woman to put forth he  utmost Strength still drawing when th  Woman's Pangs are upon her The Hea  being drawn forth he must with all spee  slip his Hand under the Armholes of th  Child and take it quite forth giving the  things to the Woman  viz  A Toast of  White Bread in a quarter of a Pint of Ip  cras Wine  Now the former Application and En  deavour failing and the following Med  cines will not enable the Woman to ca  forth the Birth you may proceed to Instru  ments after another manner  First  whe  the Woman is in her bed let her receiv  the ensuing Portion hot abstaining fro  all manner of Meats and rest till she fe  the Operation which is this  Take Blue Figs to the number of seven  them in pieces adding to them Fenugreek Motherwort and Seeds of Rice of each fi  Drams Water of PennyRoyal and Mothe  wort six Ounces of eachâ–ª boile them till  half be consumed and having strained the  again add Trochisces of Myrrh a Dram an  of Saffron three Grains sweetning the Liqu  with LoafSugar and spicing it with Cinna  mon  Having rested upon this let her labour  gain as much as may be and if she be not  et successful  make a Suffumation of  Castor Oppoponax Sulpher  and  Assa Foetida  of  uch half a Dram beating them into Powder  wetting them with the Juice of Rue  ntil they become stiff then Burn them up  Coals so that the Smoake or the Fume  only come to the Matrix and no fur  er    If these effect not your desire then  his Emplaster is very fitly to be applied  Take of Galbanum an Ounce and a half  olocynthis without Grains Two Drams  Juice of Motherwort and Rue of each Half an Ounce and Two Ounces of Virgin  swax bruise and melt them together  reading them as a S  ar Cloath to reach from  Navel to Os Pubis spreading likewise  the Flanks at the same time making  nvenient Pessary of Wool closing it in Bag of Silk and dipping it in a Concoc  n of round B  rthwort Savin Colocyn  his with Grains Staves  Black Hele  e of each a Dram and of Rue a little  rig or two  These things failing and the Woman  danger let the Chyrurgeon use his  nstrument to dilate and widen the womb  which purpose the Woman must be set  a Chair so that she may turn her Crupper  as much from its Back as is convenie  drawing up her Legs as close as she ca  out spreading her thighs as wide as may or if through her weakness it appear mo  convenient that she be laid upon the Be  with her Head downwards her Butto  raised and her Legs drawn up as much can be at what time the Chyrurgeon wi  his  Spiculum Matrices  or his Apertory  dilate or widen the womb and draw o  the Child and Secundines together if be possible after which the Womb  be well washed and annointed and the w  man laid in her Bed comforted there  Spices pleasent Meats and Cordials  course must be taken in the delivery of dead Children likewise with Moles  cundines or otherwise false Births  will not of themselves come forth in  season or if the Instruments aforesaid  not sufficiently widen the Womb th  other Instruments as the Drakes Bill a long Pincers ought to be used  If it so happen that any Inflamati  Swelling or concreet Blood be contrac  in the Matrix under the Film of those T  mours either before or after the Bir  where the matter appears thinner  Midwife with a Penknife or incision  strument may Launch it and Press out  corruption healing it with a Pessary d  ped in Oyl of Red Roses  If at any time through could or some violence the Child happen to be swelled in any part or have contracted a watery Tumour yet if it remain alive such means ought to be used as are least injurious to the Child or mother but if it be dead that Tumour must be let out by incision  o facilitate the Birth  As it often happens that Children come with their Feet foremost and the Hands dilating themselves from the Hips in such  case the Midwife must be well provided of necessary Oyntments to stroke and anoint  he Infant with thereby to help its coming forth lest it return again into the Womb before it can be drawn forth holding at the same time both the Arms of the Infant close to the Hips that so the Child may  ssue forth after its own manner but if then  prove too big then the Womb must be well anointed The Woman may likewise  ke sneezing Powder to cause her the more to strain and at the same time those  hat attend may gently stroke down her Belly to make the Birth defend and  eep the Child when advanced from re  ring back  Sometimes it falls out that the Child  oming with its Feet foremost has its Arms  xtended above its Head the which so  appening the Midwife must not receive  in that posture but put it back into th  Womb unless the Passage be extraordinar  wide and then she must anoint both th  Child and the Womb nor is it safe to dra  it forth before it is put into due for  which must be done after this manner  Woman lying upon her Back with  Head depressed and her Buttocks elevate  the Midwife with a gentle hand must com  press the Belly of the Woman towar  the Midrif by that means to put back  Infant observing to turn the Face of  Child towards the Back of the Mother ra  sing up its Thighs and buttocks towar  her Navel thereby to bring it to a mo  regular and natural Production  If a Child happen to come forth wi  one Foot the Arm being extended alo  the side and the other Foot turned bac  ward then must the Woman be instan  braught to Bed and laid in the post  aforesaid at what time the Midwife  carefully put back the Foot so appeari  and the Woman rock her self from one  to the other till she find the Child is tu  ed but she must not alter her posture  turn upon her Face after which she  expect her pains and must have  assistance Cordials especially not bei  wanting to revive and support her Spir  At other times it so comes to pass that  he Child lies cross in the womb and falls  pon its side if it so happen the Woman  ust not be urged in her labour neither an any expect the Birth in that manner Therefore the Midwife when she so per  ves it must use great diligence to reduce  to its right form or such a form in the Womb as 'its possible to deliver it  sp    ally by moving the Buttocks and g  iding  Head to the Passage but if she be su    essful herein let her again try by ro  king  erself to and fro and wait with patience  ll it change its manner of lying  Sometimes it falls out that the Child ha  ens the Birth with its Legs and  istorted or expanded in which as in the  ormer the Woman must rock her self but  ot with any violence till she find the  egs and Arms fall to their proper stations  may be done by a gentle Compression  the Womb but if neither of them pre  ail the Midwife with her Hand must close  Legs of the Infant and if possible she  reach them do the like to the Arms  nd so draw it forth though if it could be  duced of it self to the composure or po  ure of a natural Birth it is better  If the Infant comes forward with both  nees foremost the Hands hanging down  on the Thigh then must the Mi  wi  e  put both Knees upwards till the Feet appear taking hold of which with her Lef  Hand let her keep her Right Hand on the side of the Child and in that posture endeavour to bring it forth but if she cannotâ–ª then must the Woman rock her self till the Child is in a more convenient posture fo  Delivery  When it happens that the Child presses forward with an Arm extended upon the Thighs and the other elevated over his Head the Feet likewise streached out a  length in the Womb the Midwife in such a posture must not attempt to receive the Child but must lay the Woman upon the Bed in the manner often before recited making a soft and gentle Compression upon he  belly to oblige the Infant to retire and if on its own accord it retire not ther  must the Midwife thrust it back by th  Shoulders and bring the Arm that wa  stretched above the Head to its right place for certain it is most dangerous in thes  Extremities in this therefore the Mid  wife oug  t to take more care herein the  ordinary And first She must observe well to anoint her Hands then the Womb o  the Woman either with some sweet But  ter or some convenient  P  matom  thrustin  up her Hands as near as she can to th  Arm of the Infant and reduce it to the sid  but if she cannot recall it then must the Woman be laid on her Bed there to repose for a while and then again be conducted to a Seat prepared for the most conveniency in that affair by which time perhaps  he Child may be reduced to a better posture the which when the Midwife finds  he must draw the Arms cloase to the Hips and so recive it  If an Infant come with its Buttocks foremost being in a manner duble then the Midwife anointing her Hands must thrust  t upâ–ª and by degrees heaving up the Buttocks and after them the Back strive to turn the Head to the passage but be not over hasty in so doing lest the Infant retiring should shape it worse therefore if it cannot be turned with the hand the Woman must to Bed and rock her self taking such comfortable things as may support her Spirits till she perceive the Child  urn  If a Child come forward with its Shoulders the Neck being bowed as it often happens as also the Hands and Feet stretched upwards in such a case the Midwife must with much diligence move the Shoulders that she may direct the Head to the passage and the better to perfect it  he Woman must rock her self c These  nd such like methods are to be observed  in all single Births And the same may be observed in case of Twins or Treble Births for as the single Birth has but one Natural way and many unnatural Forms even so it happens with the Birth of many Children wherefore the Midwife must observe if Twins be in the Womb and press foreward according to the natural Form that she receive that first which is nearest the passageâ–ª not letting the other go lest by retiring it should chang  the Form nor must she when one is born delay to bring forth the other and this Birth in the natural form is the more easie because the Children are most commonly less then the single Births and consequently require a lesser passage but if this Birth happen in an unnatural form it is the more difficult and dangerous In the Birth of Twins let the Midwife be exceeding careful that the Secundines be naturally brought forth lest in such a case the Womb being delivered of its burthen falls and by its so doing the Secundines continue there longer than is requisite to the indangering of the Woman  If it so happen that the Woman is pregnant with Twins and one come naturally and the other unnaturally as the one with the Head the other with the Feet foremost then must the Midwife consider to deliver the NaturalBirth first and then i  she cannot turn the other draw it out in the posture it presses forward but if that with the Feet downwards be much before the other then may she deliver that first turning the Head on the other side  In this case the Midwife must be diligent to search that instead of Twins it be not a Monstrous Birth as a Body with two Heads or two bodies Joined together which she may observe if both the Hands come foremost by putting up her Hands betwen them as high as she can and if she find they are Twins she must gently put one of them aside to make way for the other taking at first that which is most advanced having regard to the other that  he change not its situation  Now to prevent the first Child's being in danger of its Life the Midwife as soon as 'tis come forth must tye the Navelstring as has been before directed and also bind it again with a long and large Fillet to that part of the Navel that is fastned to the Secundines the more readily to find them  The second Infant born let her diligently inquire whether there be not two Secundines for by the shortness of the Ligaments it often happens that it retires back to the damage of the Woman wherefore least in such a case the Womb should close it is most expedient to hasten them forth with all convenient speed  if two Infants are joyned togather by the Body as sometimes monstrously falls out then although the Heads come foremost yet it is convenient if possible to turn them and draw them forth by the Feet observing when they come to the Hips to draw them forth as swift as may be and in this case great care ought to be observed in anointing and widening the Passage  And thus much for extremity or Unnatural Births And the next thing I shall proceed to is how to order the Woman after Natural or Unnatural Births or Delivery  CHAP XXII What ought to be observed after Delivery  PResently after Delivery in case of a Natural Birth especially if the Woman has had hard labour it is convenient to wrap her in the Skin of a Sheep taken off before it is cold putting the flesh side to her Reens and Belly or for want of this the Skin of a Hare or Coney being flayed off as soon as killed may be applied to her Belly and in so doing the dilation made in the Birth will be closed up and the melancoly Blood expelled from those parts And these may be contributed  in Summer the space of an hour and in Winter too after which let the Woman be swathed with a fine linnen Cloth about a quarter of a Yard in bredth chafing her Belly before with Oyle of St  Jonswort  after that raise up the Matreix with a linnen Cloth many times folded then with a lettle Pillow or Quilt over her Flanks then use the Swath somewhat above the H  nches winding it prety stif applying at the same time a warm Cloth to her Nipples nor presently applying Remedies to drive back the Milk by reason the body at such a time is disordered and as it were out of frame for there is neither Vein nor Artrey which does not strongly beat where such remedies to drive back the Milk being all of a dissolving Nature it is improper to apply them to the Breast during such confusion and disorder lest by so doing evel Humours be stayed or contracted into the Brest wherefore Twelve hours ought to be the least space allowed for the Circulation and settlement of the Blood and what was cast upon the Lungs by the vehement Agitation during the Labour to retire to its proper Receptacles  A while after Delivery you may make a restrictive of the Yolk of two Eggs and a quartter of a point of White Wine an Ounce of Oyl of  Saint John'swort  as much of the Oyl of Roses  Plantain and Rosewater of each One Ounce bray them together fold a Linnen cloath and dip it therein warm it before a gentle Fire and apply it to the Breast and the pains of those parts will be greatly  eased  Present sleep is not convenient but about four hours after Delivery she may take Broath Candle or what other liquid matter is nourishing and afterwards if she be disposed to sleep it may be safely permitted And this is as much in case of a Natural Birth as ought immediately to be done  In case of Extremity or an unnatural Birth these Rules ought to be observed In the fii  st place let the Woman keep a temperate Diet by no means overcharging her self aft  r such an Excessive Evacuation and to say true her Diet must be equal to that of wounded Persons not being ruled or giving Credit to unskilful Nurses who admonish them to feed lustily the better to repair the loss of blood for that blood is not for the most part pure but such as has been detained in the Vessels or Membranes better avoided for the Health of the Woman than kept unless there happens an extraordinary Flux of Blood for if her nourishment be overgreat it will endanger her falling into a fever nay more it will increase the Milk to superfluity which crudling sometimes turns to Aposthumes  wherefore it is requisite for the first five days especially that she take moderately Panado Broath Poach'd Eggs Gelly of Chickens or Calves Feet French BarlyBroath each day somewhat increasing her allowance if she intend to be a Nurse to her Child she may take a little more then ordinary to increase the Milk by degrees which must be of no continuance but drawn off either by the Child or otherwise In this case likewise let her have Coriander or FennelSeeds boiled in her barlybroath but by any means for the time specified let her abstain from Meat If no Fever trouble her she may drink now and then a small quantity of Whitewine or Claret as also Syrup of Maidenhair or other Syrup that is Astringent taking it in a little water well boiled And after the suspicion of a Fever or fear of contraction of Humours in the Breast she may be nourished more plentifully with the Broath of Pullets Capons Pidgeons Mutton Veal  c  which must not be till after eight days from the day of delive  is over at what time the Womb unless some accident hinder has purged it self it will be then likewise expedient to give her cold Meat sparingly that so she may be enabled to gather strength she during the time resting quiet and free from disturbance not sleeping in the day time if she can avoid it If there  happen any obstruction in the Evacuation of the Excrement a Glyster may be adminstred to help the defect made after the manner following  Receipt  Take of both the Mallows and Pelletory of the Wall a handfull of each Cammomile and Mellylot Flowers of each a handfull Annyseeds and Fennelseeds of each two ounces boil them in the decoction of a Sheeps head and take of this three quarts disolving in them of common Honey and course Suger two Ounces strained well and administer it Glysterwise but if it not operate to your mind then may you take an Ounce of Catholicox  CHAP XXII What ought to be done to the Child when newly born with divers other matters relating thereto  THE Navel of the Child having been before recited the Midwife must cleanse the Infant not only in the Face but likwise the whole Body anointing the Groin Hips Buttocks with Oyl of sweet Almonds or Oyl of Ros  s to make the Skin supple and cl  se the Pores thereby to exclude the penetration of the Air and strengthen the Members nor would it be amiss if she should take the decoction of Roses or Rosecakes and red Sage decocted in Whitewine and bathe the Child therewith the decoction being bloodwarm  The Infant being thus well anointed or supplied and well dried wrap it up warm and give it a spoonful of Suger and Mollago or a scruple of Mithridate or VeniceTreacle dissolved in half a spoonfull of Canary and after it a lettle Carduswater observing to bathe or anoint it each morning as aforesaid If the Child have extream throws immediately after it comes into the World it must be rubbed with Juice of Pellitry or the Decoction unto which fresh  Butter is melted or for want of that SpinageJuice with Hogs Grease applied to the Navel with new layed Eggs mixed or cemented with Nut Oyl laying them likewise to the Navel or you may administer a Clyster made with milk the Yolk of an Egg and a small quantity of Sugar which will undoubtedly ease the Pain  Now some Children are born of evil constituted Parents or are defective thro' the evil nourishment the Woman has unadvisedly taken during her Pregnancy which occasions the Child to be much afflicted with flegmatick Humours to expell which you may lay the Child on one side and then turn it to the other for if you lay it upon the Back it will be subject to Suffocation or strangling by the ascent of the humor the Belly must above all things be kept soluble causing the Infant to void the Blood kept in the Intrails from the time of its being in the Womb by giving it a small quantity of Suppository of black Soap mixed with fresh Butter to take away the Acrimony of it after which immediately let the Infant take a Spoonfull of Syrup of Violets which will oblige Flegm to pass down but if heat be defective add to the Syrup half the quantity of Oyl of sweet Almonds bathing the Belly and Stomach of it as it is undressed  If it happens that the Child's Cods be full of wind the Child must be gently moved to and fro and the Cods anointed with Oyl of Mirrh giving it the liquid Anniseeds boiled in small Drink if they be swelled or extended with Water rub and chafe the Skin with fresh Butter and the Water will swet out But what is more to be regarded than any other thing is the chusing a good Nurse for upon that choice depends the thriving or not thriving of the Child and in such Cases these things ought to be regarded  viz  Observe that she be not dull sighted squinteyed have down cast looks that she be not consumptive or subject to Fits that her Breath is pure that no noisom Vapour be conveyed to the Lungs of the Child that she be not infected with Bloaches Boyls Blains or that she or her Husband never were afflicted with the  French Disease  that she is not given to excessive Drinking or Gluttony nor in the least subject to Epilepsie or falling Evil For the Nurse being in a manner the second Mother to the Child it drawing from her good or evil humours especial care must therefore be taken that the Nurse be good conditioned moderate in meat and drink wakeful and vigilant not fretful nor subject to passion that her Milk be clean and  sweet flowing sufficiently her Breasts well fixed and large not overfleshy nor she overfat and above all that she be not too desirous of carnal Copulation by which means the Milk will be rendred unwholsom Having thus far proceeded in these affairs I shall thro' God's Blessing lay down divers necessary matters for the Preservation of Childing Women and Infants thereby to prevent the hazard and Loss which too often happens in such Cases  CHAP XXIV To know the Exact time of Delivery by Signs that precede it and how to cause the Woman to retain the Birth  IN the Business of Generation nothing is more to be regarded by the Woman than the time of her  Conception  and  Quickning  that thereby she may be enabled to be exact in the time of her delivery every natural Delivery being at the End of months especial  y if at the time or near it the Woman is wont to have her Natural Purgations or that the time fall out with the Full or New Moon Nay tho' a day or two before or afterâ–ª for these things so falling out not only hasten but facilitate Delivery and  the knowledge of this must extend to the Woman for many Reasons First that she may prepare and dispose of her self for so great a task Second for that at such a time divers Maladies are incident to her nor can their Cause be penetrated into unless those things be well known  c  Now one thing necessary the better to enable the Woman to understand it is the time of Natural Courses for in case she have forgot or by not rightly understandeng their natural Efflux or is puzzled therein by reason of some unnatural Retention or extraordinary Evacuation she may rectify her Judgment by these Directions  viz  From the Age of to Women have their courses according to the most natural courses of the new Moon from to in the first Quarter from to or in the Full Moon and from that time to the time they cease in the last Quarter  Beside what is beforementioned she will be made sensible of the approaching time by pain in her Groin Thighs the small of her Back the lower part of her Navel together with swelling and hardness in the said places shivering and quaking throut the Body as if possessed with an Ague and suddenly after with flushing Heat Feebleness and Lassitude sm  ll Sweats on the Face and Flushings of the Blood there and her Body  will be in a manner restless she shall perceive the Child move downward with more force than ordinary and a bloody water will distill from the inferiour parts in case of these Forerunners she may be assured her time is at hand when as she must not delay sending for her Midwife whose Office tis to order her to the best advantage directions for which I have already given for wonderful it is that Nature has so well ordred her works that the Matrix opens not unless upon some extraordinary Casualty before the timeâ–ª perfixd and not till then do these Signs appear But appearing they ought to be much regarded if the Woman desires her own safety and the preservation of the Child  In case the Woman be subject to Miscarriage or to come before her time let her take Mint Roses Marjorum of each a small handful bruise them together put them in a bag flat and hang it about the Womans Neck so that it might reach to the pit of her Stomach and it will draw the Womb upwards or keep it in its place that it shall not fall down or give the Child occasion to seek for an untimely passage  CHAP XXV Of the washing of Women after Delivery with Directions how to make them  FOR the first Wash take a good handfull of young Chervil boil it in two pints of water which having done add to it a spoonful of Honey of Roses and let the Midwife use it at her discretion and it will draw down the Purgations heal and cleanse the afflicted Part There are some that use Milk instead of water affirming that it greatly mitigates the Pain but by those whom Experience hath taught better it is rejected this having been used Eight days the second Wash may be made  Take Provence Roses moist if you can but if not the dry Cakes put them into a litele Linnen Bag and boyl them sufficiently in half a pint of Water and half a pint of whitewine and use it as the former for other eight days  viz  The liquid part well strained  The third and last wash must be made of the decoction of Province Roses in a pint of whitewine and a quarter of a pint of Mirrh water and use it only four days  CHAP XXVI An Astringent for Women when occasion requires

Fire well mixed them  together spread them Plasterwise upon a Cloth fit to cover the Belly as far as is convenient some of this you may lay upon the Nipples having first anointed them with the Oyl of Acrons or  Spermaciti  and it will allay the Inflamation and much strengthen them  Take a considerable quantity of bitter Almonds peel them and bruse them well and make them into a Past with the Yolk of an Egg and Powder of Grise put the Paste into a bag of Shamy dip it in black Wine tempring it well and use it upon the place where the Searcloths have been laid on after that wash the said places with black Wine wherein Oringe flowers have been steeped and It will cleanse these parts to admiration  CHAP XXVII How to expel the Cholick from Women in ChildBirth and the violent Gripings that attend the first Dilivery  THese pains frequently afflict the Woman no less then the pangs of her Labour and are by the Ignorant taken many times the one for the other sometimes again they joyn forces and happen at the same instant which is occasioned by the crude Matter in the Stomach contracted through indignation and while such a pain lasts the Woman advanceth nothing towards her Travel to expel the Fits o  the Cholick Therefore  Take two Ounces of sweet Almonds Oy  and an Ounce of Cinnamon Water with three or four drops of Spirit of Ginger and let the Woman drink it off and if this work not your desire make a Clyster of Camom  Balm leaves Olive Oyl and new milk boile the former in the latter and having strain'd it very well administer it as tis usual in such cases nor are Fomentations proper for dispelling wind amiss  If the pain prove the Griping in th  Guts continuing long after Delivery or if i  happen upon the Courses de  ending by rea  son of the smallness of the Veins which  onvey the Blood into the Matrix which  ften befalls Women lying in of the first  hild wherefore it its altogether conve  ient to use such a Remedy at such a time  s may eradicate the Cause for the Future  nd above all I recommend this most ap  roved one used with success by many Noblewomen  Receipt  Take the root of great Comfry a dram  utmegs and Peachkernel of each two scruples  llow Amber

Rosarumâ–ª and annoint the Place grieved applying upon it a Pultis of GroundIvy  CHAP XXXII The Cause of the Bellies swelling after Delivery and how to prevent it and cure it if it happens  CErtain it is and Experience teacheth then that many Women have their Bellies swelled after Delivery as much almost as before and this happens through too much Neglect and Carelesness in not having regard to foment them as also apply a thing convenient to the Privities by which means Windiness and Vapours enter and contract in the hollow Concavities Veins and Arteries the latter of which they enter by insensible Ways Now to prevent it  Take  Origanum  Nightshade and Mastick of  each a scruple Sagapenum a dram mix them together and make them into    Pills take them all at once and after them take the quantity of a quarter of a pint of the Water of white Lillies  viz  of the Flowers    In case it be come already let her take half a pound of  Spanish  Figs the Meces of Barly and Beans finely

LinnenCloth and apply them to the Belly twice and it will return to its wont  d smallness  CHAP XXXIII Of the Inflammations of the Breast and its Cure  THE inflamation in the Breast is no other than the hard Swelling accompanied with a shooting pain also a Heating and Redness and is mostly caused by the Abundance of Blood drawn or flowing to the Breast and sometimes but rarely it is occasioned by the suppression of the  Menses  the Hemorrhoids or some Bruise received by a Blow or the like and is known by a certain Redness and burning Heat causing the whole to be Feverish and out of Order To cure it then first let the Diet  be comforting moistening and of good Nourishment as the Broth of Pullets Capons Cocks Chickens Veal  c  wherein Endive Borage Purslain or Letuce has been boiled and if she can get it let the Woman drink Juice of Pomegranats but for want of that Barlywater wherein Anniseeds have been boiled but let her refrain drinking of Wine and strong Liquors as likewise hot Spices and if she find any Obstruction in her excremental Evacuation let her take a softning or mollifying Clyster and sleep at seasonable times as much as she can Another way to remedy it is by diverting the Humours which may be done by rubbing the Body in all adjacent places letting Blood in the Foot scarification of the Legs or Vesicatories applied in those Places especially if the Menses are stopped or ready to come down if not it is requisite to bleed in the Arm  But if what has been mentioned prevail not to remove the Humours make a Cataplasm of the Leaves of Melilot and Nightshadeâ–ª each a handful and when boiled in Springwater add to them Bean meal Ounces Oil of sweet Almonds and Oatmeal of each an Ounce and apply them to the Breast observ  ng so to do before the Breast be extraordinarily inflamed  CHAP XXXIV A Tumour in the Breast its Cause and Cure  OF Tumours there are several sorts but first of the Flagitious Tumour the Cause of which proceeds from a thick and unnatural Vapour arising from the Menstrual Blood which is retained corrupted in the Matrix and that again occasioned by the suppression of the Courses or when Nature is defective in discharging them into their proper Place in due time as also from Corruption of Humours whereby are ingendred evil Vapours and their passing by several Ways causes the Breast to swell or distend as if it were a true swelling and is known by a shooting pain and disorder of Heart by Reason of the Wind that oppresseth it the left Breast being for the most part more swelled than the right communicating Pains to the Arms and Shoulders as likewise the Ribs on the same side the Breast being white and shining sounding like a Drum if touched gently and swelled in all Parts alike to cure this as also the windy Tumour you must order to observe a moderation in Diet and thereby Crudities may be avoided and all such things as contract windy Humours in the Veins suffering her  to drink Water wherein Cinnamon and Anniseeds have been boiled as also the Rind of Citron and then let her observe to take such things as are proper to provoke the Courses in doing which she will find the Humours abate then let her take Celundine Camomile Groundsil and GroundJuice stamp them and boil them in White wine and in so doing you will ease the Pain and restore the Breast As for Diseases and Accidents incident to young Children there are few Women of any Experience but are skilful in curing and ordering them wherefore for brevities sake I shall pass them over and proceed to Anatommize the Genital Parts of a Man that one thing remaining necessary in this Trreatise as also to instance what Men and Women ought to marry that their Issue may be fair healthful and prosperous  CHAP XXXV The Anatomy of the Organs of Generation in Man  THE Yard which is called in Latin  Penis a Pendendo  because it hangeth out of the Organal Part is made of Skin Tendons Veins Arteries Sinews and great Ligaments and is long round and on the upper side flattish seated under the  Ossa Pubis    and design'd by Nature partly for making of Water and partly for conveying the Seed into the Matrix To which end there open into it small Pores through which the Seed passes to it from the  Vesiculae Seminales  and also the Neck of the  Vesica Vrinari  which pours out the Urine in making of Water Besides the common parts as the Cirticle the Skin and the  Membrana Carnosa  it has in these proper or internal Parts as the two  Nervous Bodies  the  Septum  the  Vrethra  the  Glans  four  Muscles  and the  Vessels  The Nervous Body so called are surrounded with a thick white nervous Membrane but their inner substance is spungy consisting chiefly of Veins Arteries and nervous Fibres interwoven together like a Net and when the Nerves are repleat with Animal Spirits and the Arteries with hot and spiritous Blood then the  Penis  is distended and becomes Erect but when the Influx of the Spirits ceases then the Blood and remaining Spirits absorded by the Veins and so the  Penis  becomes limber and flaggy Below these nervous Bodies lie the  Vrethra  and whenever the nervous Bodies swell it swells also The Muscles of the  Penis  are Four  two shorter  arising from the  Coxendix  and serving it Erection are therefore called  Erect  res  and  two larger  proceeding from the  Spincter  of the  Arms  and serve to  dilate the  Vrethra  from Miction and Ejection of the Seed and are therefore called  Dilatantes  or  Wideners  At the End of the  Penis  is the  Glans  covered with a very thin Membrane by means of which and its Nervous Substance it becomes most exquisitely  en  ible and is the Principal Seat of Pleasure in Copulation The outmost Covering of the  Glans  is called  Praeputium a praeputanda  from being cut off it being that which the Jews cut off in Circumcision And it is  ed in the lower part of it to the  Glans  by the  Fraenum  or Bridle The  Penis  is also stocked with Veins Arteries and Nerves and that part that is next above it towards the Belly is called the  Pubes  and its lateral Parts is called  Inguina  the Groins  The  Testicles  or  Stones  so called because they testifie one to be a Man elaborate the Blood brought to them by the  Spermatick  Arteries into  Seed  They have Coats of two sorts and invest both the  Testes Cuticula  and true Skin and is called  Scrotum  hanging out of the  Abdomen  like a Purse The inner Common Coats in the  Membrana Carnosa  the proper Coats are also two the outer called  Eltroides  or  Virginales  the  nner  Albiginea  into the outer are inserted the Cremister Muscles to the upper part of the  Testes  are fixed the  Epididymedes  or  Prostata  from whence arise the  Vasa Deferentia  and  Ejectoria  which when they come near the Neck of the Bladder deposite the Seed into the  Vesiculae Seminales  These  Vesiculae Seminales  are two each like a bunch of Grapes and emit the Seed into the  Vrethra  in the Act of Copulation  Near them are the  Prostata  about the bigness of a Walnut and joined to the Neck of the Bladder Authors cannot agree about the Use of them but most are of Opinion that they afford an Oily slippery and Fat Humour to besmear the  Vrethra  whereby to defend it from the Acrimony of the Seed and is made like the  Arteria Spermatica  and also two The Veins which carry back the remaining Blood are two and have the name of  Venae Spermaticae    CHAP XXVI What Women ought to Marry with what Men that they might have Children  IN respect of Married Women that prove Childless  Hypocrates  adviseth this Experiment to be tried to know whether the Defect be on the Woman's part or on he  Husbands which is to make her Suffumigations with Incense or Storax with a Garment loose wrapped about her which may hang down on the Ground in such  sort that no Vapour nor Fume may issue out and if within a while after she feel the Savour of the Incense in her Mouth she may then conclude that the Barrenness comes not through her own Defect but through her Husband's forasmuch as the Fumes found the Passage open whereby it pierced up the Nostrils But although this proof perform that Effect which  Hypocrates  speaketh of namely the piercing up to the Inner part of the Mouth yet is this no infallible Argument of the Husbands Barrenness nor of the Fruitfulness of the Wife since Want of Children may arise through an unapt disposition in them both in respect of the Correspondency of Qualities for it hath oftentimes appeared that a Man that could not have Children by one Wife hath had them by another the like also hath befallen Women  Hypocrates  gives us his Opinion concerning the correspondency that ought in that respect to be betwixt Man and Wife in these Words If the Hot and Dry answer not the Cold and Moist in Measure and Quantity that is if there meet in the Womb two Seeds the one  Hot  the other  Cold  the one  Dry  the other Moist extended in equal Degree there can be no Generation For so marvellous a Work as the Formation of Man says he could  not be performed without proportionable Commixture of Seed To exemplifie this Assertion of his the Ancient Physicians go on and say That a Woman who is wilely illconditioned shrillvoic  d lean swarthycoloured and deformed which are the signs of  Cold and Moist in the first Degree  may conceive by a Man who is ignorant goodnatur'd sweetvoic'dâ–ª corpulent having little hair a wellcol  ur'd Face and a handsome Body which are the Signs of  Hot and Dry in the first Degree  in regard she retaineth a mean in all those signs abovementioned is most like to be fruitful because she comes nearest in proportion to Men of each several Temperature But from the first of these Unions or Conjoining of Man and Woman are most likely to issue the wisest Children say they because the dryness of the Mother correcteth and amendeth the Defect of the Father But this being chiefly grounded upon that old Opinion of the Commixture of the Seed of the Man and Woman together and of the Child's being formed from thence we think fit to reject it and to affirm That Youth Strength and Vigour a sound body and a Mind free from Cares with a mutual Love and Amity betwixt the Man and Woman seldom fail of their desired Effects  CHAP XXXVII A Word of Advice to both Sexes in the Act of Copulation  THE Act of Copulation being ordained by Nature as the Ground of all Generation and without which no Birth can be produced somewhat must be said of it but we shall cloath it in the modest Dress that the chastest Ears may hear without being put to the Trouble of a Blush  It is convenient on this Occasion to cherish the Body with generous Restoratives to charm the Imagination with Musick to drown all Cares in good Wine that so the Mind being elevated to a Pitch of Joy and Rapture the sensual Appetite may be more freely encouraged to gratifie it self in the Delights of Nature For Melancholy and Grief and whatsoever is troublesome to the Senses and Fancy are Enemies to the Pastime of the NuptialBed Yet is it necessary to avoid Excesses in Eating and Drinking for if the Body be overcharg'd with Wine or Meat the Spirits will become dull and unactive and unable to p  rform their Office This you may take for a good Rule That a little of what is  good and welldigested breeds good blood good blood creates good Spirits and when a Man is invigorated with a plentiful Stock of such he is able to do Miracles Also when the Husband and Wife meet with an equal Ardour in their conjugal Embraces it is very rare if it be not attended with Conception But when that Act is over all is not done for that it may have the better Suceess the Husband must not presently seperate himself from his Wife's Embraces lest the Air should suddenly strike in and so prevent the Issue of their Labours And when the Man departs the Woman ought to compose her self to all the Rest and Quietness imaginable and to avoid heavy Thoughts of what may cause any Disturbance and especially she ought to avoid Coughing and Sneezing both which are great hinderances to Conception after the Act of Copulation  Parry  saith That in the Year he saw in  Paris  a Boy nine years old born near  Guise  he had but two Fingers on his right Hand his Arm was well proportioned from the top of his Shoulders to bis Wrist but from thence to the Fingers Ends it was very deformed he wanted his Legs and Thighs  c  As in the Page following  The Effigies of a Monstrous Child by reason of the Defect of the Matter of Seed  In  Stecquer  a Village of  Saxony  they say a Monster was born with Four Feet Eyes Mouth and Nose like a Calf with a  round and red Excrescence of Flesh on the Forehad and also a Piece of Flesh like a Hood hung from his Neck upon his Back and it was deform'd with its Thighs torn and cut as here shewen  An Dom  There was generated of a  Woman  and a  Dog  an Issue which from the Navel upward  perfectly  resembled the shape of the  Mother  but  thence downward the Sire  i c  the Dog This Monster was sent to the Pope that then reigned as  Voluterane  writeth  Caedane  also mentions it wherefore I have given you the Figure thereof  Jovianus Pontanus  tells us in  Jan  there was a Man Child born in  Gormany  having Arms and as many Legs As in this Figure  In the Year of our Lo  d in which year upon Easter day near  Ravenna  was fought that mortal Battle in which the Popes For  es were ovverthrown a Monster was born in  Ravenna  having a horn upon the Crown of his head and besides two VVings and one Foot alone most like the Feet of Birds of Birds of Prey and in the Knee thereof one Eye the Privities of Male and Female the rest of the Body like a Man as you may see by the Figure  FINIS  The Effigies of a Maid all Hairy and an Infant that was Black by the Imagination of their Parents
