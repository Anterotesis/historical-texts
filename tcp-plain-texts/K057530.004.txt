 THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  VOL IV  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  'TIS SO PAT TO ALL THE TRIBE  EACH CRIES THAT WAS LEVELLED AT ME  GAY  VOLUME IV  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G G AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW AND SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  CHAP I  THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF ILLICIT ATTEMPTS TO BECOME RICH THE SLEEP OF A GAMESTER MORNING MEDITATIONS  THE pungency of extreme grief acts as a temporary opiate for a short time it lulls the sufferer to insensibility and sleep but it is only to recruit him and awaken him to new torments  When I reached my lodgings I appeared to myself to have sunk into a state of quiescent resignation The die was cast My doom was irrevocable and despair itself seemed to have lost its charm the animation the vigour of misery was gone I was reduced to an inevitable  posthorse kind of endurance and had only now to be thankful if I might be permitted to exist From an audacious and arrogant confidence in my own strength I had suddenly yet by perceptible gradations declined though with excruciating pangs at every step till I now at last found myself in a state of sluggish and brute imbecility  Staggering home in this temper I undressed myself went to bed with stupid composure and felt like a wretch that had been stretched on the rack and having just been taken off was suffered to sink into lifeless languor because he could endure no more I was mistaken My sleeping sensations soon became turbulent oppressive fevered terrific yet cumbrous and impossible to awake from and escape  It was seven in the morning when I returned to my lodging When I went to bed my heaviness was so great that I  seemed as if I could have slept for centuries and so multifarious and torturing were the images that haunted me that the time actually appeared indefinitely protracted a month a year an age yet it was little more than two hours The moment struggling nature had cast off her horrible nightmares and I had once more started into identity the anguish of the past day and night again seized me Pains innumerable and intolerable rushed upon me Each new thought was a new serpent Mine was the head of Medusa with this difference my scorpions shed all their venom inward  Confusion of mind is the source of pain but confusion is the greatest in minds that are the seldomest subject to it and with those the pain is proportionably intense The conflict was too violent to be endured without an endeavour to get rid of it I rose traversed my room I  know not how long and at last rushed into the street with a sort of feeling that when in the open air the atmosphere of misery that enveloped me would be swallowed up and lost in the infinite expanse  The hope was vain it wrapped me round like a cloak It was a universal caustic that would not endure to be touched much less torn away I groaned I gnashed my teeth I griped my hands I struck myself violent blows I ran with fury in circles in zigzag with sudden turns and frantic bounds and finding myself on the banks of the Avon plunged headlong in  I acted from no plan or forethought therefore was far from any intention to drown myself and being in the water I swam as I had run like a mad or hunted bull  That unpremeditated sensation which enforces immediate action is what I suppose  Philosophers mean by instinct if the word ever had any definite meaning Thousands of these instinctive experiments are no doubt injurious to the animals that make them but their number being unlimited some of them are successful The benefit is remembered they are repeated and a future race profits by the wisdom that becomes habitual I am well persuaded that my immersion in the stream was assuaging and gamesters hereafter or the faculty themselves may if they please profit by the experiment  I have no distinct recollection of coming out of the water though I remember walking afterward two or three hours till my cloaths were again entirely dry My feelings in the interval were somewhat similar to those of the preceding evening declining from frantic agitation to stupidity and torpor  CHAP II  AN UNEXPECTED RENCONTRE AND A DESPERATE CONTEST VICTORY DEARLY BOUGHT  MAN is or which is the same thing his sensations are continually changing and it may be truly affirmed that he is many different animals in the course of a day A very unexpected yet very natural incident again rouzed me to a state of activity  During my ramble I had strayed among the new buildings below the Crescent I know not whether I had any latent hope or wish of having a distant sight of Olivia walking there as is customary for air and exercise though I was certainly far too much degraded in my own opinion to intend being seen myself even by her much less by any of those proud beings those ephemerae of fortune with whom while I despised their arrogance not to  associate not to be familiar nay not to treat with a sort of conscious superiority was misery We all practise that haughtiness ourselves which in others is so irritating to our feelings and for which we pretend to have so sovereign a contempt  As I passed a number of workmen my moody apathy though great did not prevent me from hearing one of them exclaim with a loud and suddenly angry surprize "By G that is he"  I was at some little distance I heard the steps of a man running speedily toward me I turned round He looked me full in the face and with no less eagerness repeated"Yes Dmn me if it is not Dick Will Come here Run"  I stood fixed I did not recollect ever to have seen the exact figure before me but I had a strong and instantaneously a painful impression of the same form in  a different garb It was the man whom I had accused the day before of picking my pocket the poor fellow who had been so unmercifully ducked and ill treated by the mob  His impatience of revenge was furious Without uttering another word he made a desperate blow at me I was unprepared and it brought me to the ground His foot was up to second it with as violent a kick but fortunately the generous spirit of my opponent and the laws of mob honour were mutually my shield He recollected the cowardice as well as the opprobrium of kicking a combatant when down and in the tone of rage commanded me to get up  I was not slow in obeying the mandate nor he in repeating the assault I warded several of his blows which were dealt with too much thoughtless fury to be dangerous but again and again called on him to stop for a moment and  hear me I felt I had been the cause of much mischief to the man and had no alacrity to increase the wrong My behaviour was not that of fear and his companions at length got between us and for a moment prevented the battle  We were at the bottom of the hill the beginning of the fray had been seen and the crowd was collecting in every direction The beaus descended from the crescent and left their belles to view us through their operaglasses and pockettelescopes while they came to collect more circumstantial information The Mowbray family had just arrived at this public  promenade  Hector and tall Andrews joined the mob the aunt and Olivia remained on the walk  The story of the false accusation the ducking and the injuries done to my antagonist ran varied and mangled from mouth to mouth a general sensation of rage was excited against me  and Hector and Andrews very charitably gave it every assistance in their power Not satisfied with this they proposed the  Lex Talionis  and called"Duck him" "Duck him" They took care however to turn their backs imagining that amid the hubbub I should not distinguish their voices  My antagonist though but a journeyman carpenter had too much of the hero in him to admit of this mean revenge His anger could only be appeased by chastising me with his own arm and proving to me as well as to the crowd how unworthy he was of that contemptible character which my accusation had endeavoured to fix upon him He was therefore determined to oblige me to fight  I never remember to have felt greater repugnance than I now had to defend myself by committing more hurt and injury upon this indignant but brave fellow  I tried to expostulate nay to intreat but in vain my remonstrances were construed into cowardice and fight I must or suffer such disgrace as my tyrophilosophy was ill calculated to endure  My antagonist was stripped in form and as the diversion of a battle is what an English mob will never willingly forego I found partisans who determined to see fair play encouraged instructed me clapped me on the back and partly by intreaty partly by violence stripped off my coat They were vexed at my obstinate refusal to part with my waistcoat and shirt  With their usual activity they soon made a ring and I stood undetermined and excessively reluctant not very willing to receive but infinitely averse to return the blows he now once more began to deal  The carpenter was an athletic and powerful man famous for the battles he  had fought and the victories he had gained His companions who evidently had an affection for him and who knew his prowess had no supposition that I could withstand him for five minutes though the hopes of those who were the most eager for the sport had been a little raised by the alertness with which I rose after being at first knocked down and the skill with which I then stood on my defence  The doubts that pervaded my mind imparted I suppose something of that appearance to my countenance which is occasioned by fear for my adversary approached me with looks of contempt and as I retreated bade me stand forward and face him like a man The crowd behind seconded him and fearing it should be a runaway victory was rather willing to press upon and push me forward than to recede and give me any play Hector and Andrews were  all the while very active as instigators  My indecision occasioned me to receive several severe blows without returning one till at length I was again extended on the ground by a very desperate blow near the ear which for a few seconds deprived me of all sense and recollection  This was no longer to be endured As soon as I recovered I sprang on my feet condescended to strip and became in turn the assailant The joy and vociferation of the mob were immense They thought it had been all over and to see me now rise stand forward and fight as I did with so much determination and effect was to them rapture They had discovered a hero Their education had taught them for such is education that the man who has the power to endure and to inflict the most misery is the most admirable  For six successive rounds I had completely the advantage during which my brave foe had received five knockdown blows for that is the phrase His companions and friends were astonished The beau pugilists were vociferating their bets five pounds to a crown in my favour  The carpenter was as hardy as he was courageous He collected himself I had become less circumspect and he threw in another dangerous blow near my temple with the left hand that again felled me insensible to the earth  I now recovered more slowly and less effectually I had been severely breathed by the violence of exertion The laws of pugilistic war will not suffer a man to lie after being knocked down more than a certain number of seconds Hector had his stopwatch in his hand and tall Andrews joined him to enforce the rule in all its rigour I was lifted on  my feet before I had perfectly recovered my recollection and was again knocked down though with less injury While down I received a kick in the side of which my partisans instantly accused Andrews  Meaning to do me mischief he did me a favour The wrangling that took place gave me time to recover and being again brought in face of my opponent I once more proposed a reconciliation and stretching out my arm asked him to shake hands But no The ducking was too bitterly remembered "He would beat me or never go alive from the ground"  For a moment the generous thought of acknowledging myself vanquished suggested itself but rising vanity and false shame spurned at the proposal therefore since he was so desperate I had no resource but in being equally savage Accordingly I bent my whole powers to this detestable purpose brought him  twice more to the ground and on the third assault gave him a blow that verified his own prediction for he fell dead at my feet and was taken up lifeless from the place  Agony to agony Vice to vice Such was my fate Where when how was it to have an end Were not my own personal sufferings sufficient Accuse an innocent man of theft deliver him over to the fury of a mob and not contented with that meet him again to fight beat murder him And without malice without evil intention Nay with the very reverse abhorring the mischief I had done him and admiring the intrepidity and fortitude he had displayed  Nor did it end here the intelligence that was instantly sent round was horror indeed He had left a wife and seven children  CHAP III  THE KIND BEHAVIOUR OF OLD FRIENDS A JOYFUL RECOVERY MORE MISFORTUNES PATIENCE PER FORCE  NEVER were sensations more truly tragical than mine yet as is frequent they had a dash of the ridiculous which resulted from the machinations of my good friends Hector and Andrews To inspire others with the contempt in which they held or rather endeavoured to hold me and to revenge the insults which they supposed themselves to have received from me were their incentives They knew I had been stripped of my money at the gamingtable they mingled with the partisans of the carpenter and informing them that I was a pretended gentleman advised them to have me taken before a magistrate for that the law would at least make me provide for  the widow and children Perhaps it would hang me as I deserved They farther proposed a subscription to begin with me and accordingly they came up to me as by deputation with the murdered man's hat  The mortification they intended me had its full effect I was pennyless and the epithets which generous souls like these appropriate to such upstart intruders upon their rights and privileges as myself were muttered with as much insolence as they had the courage to assume  I was not yet tamed I could not endure this baiting I hated almost abhorred Andrews He dared to pretend love to Olivia he had brought me into disgrace with her nay was soon to rob me of her everlastingly and recollecting the kick he had bestowed upon me when down I called him a scoundrel and accompanied the coarse expression with a blow  In a moment the mob were again in agitation expected another battle admired my hardy valour and called for a ring Andrews knew better he saved them the trouble and shuffled away followed though scouted even by Hector himself for his cowardice Mowbray remembered the battle of the rats and by comparison found himself a very hero  The moment I was permitted I enquired to what place the poor carpenter had been taken and followed with infinite terror but with a faint degree of hope some affirming that he was dead others that he was not I was attended by several of my admirers  It would be vain to attempt any picture of what my feelings were when coming into his dwelling I found him alive sitting surrounded by his wife children and companions I fell on my knees to him I owned all the mischief I had  done him I conjured him for God's sake to forgive me I was half frantic and the worthy fellow in the same free spirit with which he had sought stretched out his hand in token of his forgiveness and friendship  His unaffected magnanimity prompted me instantly to execute a design which I had before formed "Stay where you are my good friends" said I to the people that stood round him "I will be back in a few minutes The little reparation that I can make I will make to shew you that it was from error and not ill intention that I have done this brave man so much injury"  So saying I ran out of the house directed my course to my lodgings and hastened to my trunk to take out the tenpound note which I had reserved to pay my Bath debts My passions were too much in a hurry to admit of any enquiry how these debts were to be paid  when I should have given the banknote to the carpenter I was determined not to enquire but to appease my feelings rescue my character and bestow it on him  Where were my troubles to end The persecuting malice of fortune was intolerable Philip the footman whom I had hired but scarcely ever employed had disappeared having previously broken open my trunk and taken with the ten pounds such of my linen and effects as he could carry under his cloaths and in his pockets without being seen  This was a stroke little less painful than the worst of the accidents that had befallen me yet so harassed was my mind and so wearied with grieving that I did not feel it with half the poignancy  Act however I must But how I had left the carpenter and his family in suspense Must I talk of favours which I could not confer or mention remuneration  that would but seem like mockery This was painful but not so painful as falsehood  I therefore returned related the story of the robbery and added that "my intentions were to have endeavoured to afford some small recompence for the unintentional injury I had committed I was sorry that at present this accident had deprived me of the power but I hoped I should not always be so very destitute I certainly should neither forget the debt I had incurred nor the noble behaviour of the man who had suffered so much from me At present I was very unfortunate but if ever I should become more prosperous I should remember my obligation and in what manner it would become me to see it discharged"  I was heard with patience and with no disappointment My auditors though poor were far from selfish Beside as  I had not previously declared what I had intended I had excited little expectation My vanquished opponent whose name was Clarke was soothed by the justice I did him in defending his innocence and praising his courage and said "I had given him the satisfaction of a man and that was all he asked" He rather sympathized with my loss than felt a loss of his own and gave various indications of a generous spirit such as is seldom to be found among persons who would think themselves highly disgraced by any comparison between them and a poor carpenter I own I quitted him with a degree of esteem such as neither the lord nor the bishop I had once been so willing or rather so industrious to revere had the good fortune to inspire  Having said every thing I could recollect to remove the doubts which the whole transaction might have excited  against me I was eager to return to my lodging and consider what was best to be done  The probability of tracing my footman and recovering the bank note a considerable portion of which by the bye was due to him for wages suggested itself I recollected that when I rose after my two hours sleep he had brought the breakfast and had manifested some tokens of anxiety at perceiving the perturbation of my mind I had hastily devoured the bread and butter that was on the table and drank a single bason of tea after which he enquired as I went out when I should be back And I had answered in a wild manner "I did not know Perhaps never"  From the degree of interest that he had shewn the robbery appeared the more strange and the remembrance of his enquiring and compassionate looks made me  the less eager to pursue and have him hanged though at that time I considered hanging as a very excellent thing  Beside I had not the means of pursuit I had no money He had probably taken the London road and profiting by the first stagecoach that passed was now beyond my reach  But how was I to act How discharge my debts What was to become of me I could find no solution to these difficulties I was oppressed by them I was wearied by the excess of action on my body as well as mind I sunk down on the bed without undressing or covering myself and fell into a profound sleep  CHAP IV  A FEVER BAD MEN HAVE GOOD QUALITIES MORE PROOFS OF COMPASSION A SCANDALOUS TALE DOES NOT LOSE IN TELLING FAREWELL TO BATH  THE emptiness of my stomach for I had eaten nothing except the bread and butter I mentioned since the preceding day at dinner the heats into which my violent exertions had thrown me and the sudden reverse of cold to which my motionless sleep subjected me produced consequences that might easily have been foreseen I awoke in the dead of the night and found myself seized with shivering fits my teeth chattering a sickness at my stomach my head intolerably heavy and my temples bruised with the blows I had received and having a sensation as if they were ready to burst To all this was added the stiffness that pervaded  the muscles of my arms and body from the bruises falls and battering they had received  It was with difficulty I could undress myself and get into bed where after I had lain shaking with increasing violence I know not how long my agueish sensations left me and were changed into all the soreness pains and burning that denote a violent fever  During this paroxysm I felt consolation from its excess which persuaded me that I was now on my death bed I remembered all the wrongs which I conceived myself to have suffered with a sort of misanthropical delight arising from the persuasion that in my loss the world would be punished for the vileness of its injustice toward me Perhaps every human being conceives that when he is gone there will be a chasm which no other mortal can supply and I am not certain that he does not conceive truly  Young men of active and impetuous talents have this persuasion in a very forcible degree  All that I can remember of this fit of sickness till the violence and danger of it were over is that the people of the house came to me in the morning I knew not at what hour and made some enquiries A delirium succeeded which was so violent that at the beginning of my convalescence I had absolutely lost my memory and could not without effort recollect where I was how I had come there or what had befallen me The first objects that forcibly arrested my attention and excited memory were the honest carpenter Clarke and his wife sitting by my bedside and endeavouring to console me  The particulars which I afterward learned were that Belmont had come the first day of my illness had seen me delirious had heard the account of my having been  robbed and had left a twentypound note for my immediate necessities  So true is it that the licentious the depraved and the unprincipled are susceptible of virtue and desirous of communicating happiness The most ignorant only are the most inveterately brutal but nothing less than idiotism or madness can absolutely deprive man of his propensity to do good  I was further informed that a sealed paper addressed to Mr Trevor had been received and opened in the presence of the physician containing another twentypound bankbill but the paper that inclosed it was blank and that Clarke unable to go immediately to work and reflecting on what he had heard from me concerning the destitute state in which I a stranger in Bath was left by the robbery of my servant had walked out the next day had come with fear and diffidence to enquire after me and that finding  me in a high fever his wife bad been my first nurse  Her own large family indeed prevented her from watching and continuing always with me and therefore another attendant was obliged to be hired but she was by my bed side the greatest part of every day and her husband the same till he was again able to work after which he never failed to come in the evening  He was a generous fellow I had won his heart by my desire to do him justice and my condescension excited a degree of adoration in him when he found that I was really what the world calls a gentleman He had visited me before Belmont had left the money and hearing the landlady talk of sending me to the hospital had proposed to take me to his home that he and his wife might do a christian part by me and I not be left to the mercy of strangers  And here as they are intimately connected with my own history it is necessary I should mention such particulars as I have since learned concerning Olivia  Hector and Andrews had been busy in collecting all the particulars they could relating to me from the mob among whom the strangest rumours ran of which these my fast friends were predisposed to select the most unfavourable and to believe and report them as true All of these they carried to Olivia and her aunt and the chief of them were that I had falsely accused a man of theft had seized him by the collar dragged him to the water and had been the principal person in ducking him to death The brother of this man had discovered who I was and had followed me with his comrades to have me taken before a magistrate but I had artfully talked to the people round me had got a part of the mob on my side and had then begun  to beat and ill use the brother They added that I had stripped like a common bruiser of which character I was ambitious that the brother had sought with uncommon bravery that he had been treated with foul play by me and my abettors and that in conclusion I had killed him that in addition to this I had prevented a subscription for the widow and  nine  young children which had been proposed by them that I had insulted them struck at Andrews and challenged him to box with me for this their charitable endeavour to relieve the widow and her children and that having lost my last guinea at the gaming table the night before in their presence I should probably run away from my lodgings or perhaps turn highwayman for which they thought me quite desperate enough  It may well be imagined what effect a story like this would produce on the mind of Olivia corroborated as it was  though not proved in every incident by the circumstances which she herself had witnessed from the crescent by those which she gathered on enquiry from other people by her own experience of my rash impetuosity and these all heightened by the conjectures of an active imagination and a heart not wholly uninterested She hoped indeed that I had not actually killed two men but she had the most dreadful doubts  The impression it made upon her did not escape the penetration of the aunt and she determined to quit Bath and take Olivia with her the very next day Terrified by the possibility that the predictions of Hector and Andrews should be fulfilled Olivia ventured secretly to instruct her maid to search the book in the pump room and find my address and afterward to send her with the twentypound bankbill hoping that this temporary resource might have some  small chance of preventing the fatal consequences which she feared  Had they returned to London by the aid of Miss Wilmot and Mary she might have made further enquiries but the cautious aunt directed her course to Scarborough  I was excessively reduced by the fever According to the physician and apothecary my life had been in extreme danger and eight weeks elapsed before I was able to quit Bath The expences I had incurred amounted to between eight and nine and twenty pounds I was fully determined to bestow the ten pounds I had originally intended on Clarke Thus after distributing such small gifts among the servants as custom and my notion of the manners of a gentleman demanded the only choice I had was either to sell my cloaths or with four and sixpence in my pocket to undertake a journey to London on foot  I preferred the latter sent my trunk to the waggon returned for the last time to my lodging inclosed a ten pound note in a letter in which I expressed my sense of the worth of Clarke and my sorrow for the evil I had done him and sending it by the maidservant I followed and watched her to his dwelling  CHAP V  THE PAIN OF PARTING THE PROSPECT BEFORE ME POOR MEN HAVE THEIR AFFECTIONS AND FRIENDSHIPS  DURING my recovery I had conversed freely on my own affairs with Clarke and his wife They gradually became acquainted with my whole history and discovered so much interest in the pictures I drew and entered so sympathetically and with such unaffected marks of passion into all my feelings that I found  not only great ease but considerable delight in narrating my fears hopes and mishaps  Clarke had a strong understanding and was not entirely illiterate His wife was active cleanly and kind Their children were managed with great good sense the three eldest were put out two to service and the other an apprentice and large as their family was they had by labour and oeconomy advanced a considerable step from the extreme poverty to which such persons are too often subject  When I went to take leave of them I could perceive not only that they were both very much affected but that Clarke had something more on his imagination He had a great respect for my gentility and learning and was always afraid of being too familiar At some moments he felt as it were the insolence of having fought with me at others a gleam of  exultation broke forth at his having had that honour He had several times expressed an earnest wish that he might be so happy as to see me again and when I assured him that he should hear from me his feelings were partly doubt and partly strong delight  Just as I was prepared to bid them farewell he gave a deep sigh and said "he thought he should soon come to London He wished he knew where I might be found and if he should leave the country it would be a great favour done him if he might but be allowed to come and ask me how I did If I would allow him that honour it would make his heart very light He had been many years in his present employ and perhaps his master would be sorry if he were to leave him but he had given him fair notice At one time he did not believe he ever should have left him but he thought  now he should be much happier in London"  His tone was serious there was a dejectedness in his manner and with it as was evident much smothered emotion in his heart I was affected and taking his hand earnestly assured him that if ever fortune should smile on me I would not forget what had happened at Bath His parting reply was "God be with you wherever you go Perhaps you may see me again sooner than you think for"  This was the temper in which we took leave previous to my sending the maid with the tenpound note and as I passed within sight of his door I felt the regret of quitting a human being whose attachment to me was manifestly so strong and affectionate But I had no alternative and I pursued my road  Winter was advancing the weather was rainy the roads were heavy The  cloudy sky sympathised with the gloom of the prospect before me I had wasted my patrimony quarrelled with my protectors renounced the university had no profession no immediate resource and had myself and my mother to provide for by what means I knew not  The experience of Wilmot seemed to prove how precarious a subsistence the labours of literature afford and Wilmot was indisputably a man of genius  I had not quite concluded against the morality of the practice of the law but I remembered in part the objections of Turl and they were staggering Had it been otherwise where would have been the advantage I had entered of the Temple but I had neither the means of keeping my terms nor the patience to look forward for precarious wealth and fame to so distant a period  All this might have been endured but OliviaWhere was shePerhaps  at that moment the wife of AndrewsOr if not grant she were never to be his she never could be mine Yet mine she must be Mine she should be I would brave the despotism of her odious enslavers I would move heaven and earth I would defy hell itself to separate us  Such were the continual conflicts to which I was subject and while the fogs of despondency rose thick aud murky around me with them continually rose the  ignis fatuus  of hope dancing before my eyes and encouraging me step after step to follow on  Considering how wild and extravagant the desires of youth are it is happy for them that they calculate so ill and are so shortsighted Their despair would else be frequently fatal  I did not forget as a supposed immediate means of relief that my pamphlet against the Earl and the Bishop was  printed and I thought the revenge more than justifiable it was a necessary vindication of my own honour and claims I was indeed forty pounds in debt twenty to Belmont and twenty more to I knew not whom though I suspected and partly hoped partly feared it was Olivia I hoped it because it might be affection I feared it left it should be nothing more than pity for one whom she had known in her childhood but whom now he was a man she might compassionate but must contemn To have been obliged even to Olivia on these terms was worse than starving Such were my meditations through the day which was a little advanced when I left Bath  I was eager to perform my journey and had walked at a great rate A little before twilight I heard a distant call two or three times repeated At last I turned round saw a hat waving and heard my own name  I stopped and the person approached It was Clarke I was surprised and enquired the reason of his following me He was embarrassed and began with requesting I would go a little slower for he had run and walked till he was half tired and he would tell me  Clarke was an untaught orator He had very strong feelings and a clear head which are the two grand sources of eloquence "You know" said he "how much mischief I have done you for it cannot be denied I struck you first and knocked you down when you  was  off your guard I set every body against you I refused to shake hands with you over and over when you had the goodness to offer to forgive me And last of all you may thank me for the fever which brought you to death's door You forgave me this as well as the rest But that was not all That would not content you Because I had been used  ill without any malice of yours nothing would satisfy you but to strip yourself of the little  modicum  that you had and give it to me So that I am sure you have hardly a shilling to take you up to London And when you are there you are not so well off as I am you have no trade I can turn my hand to twenty things you have never been used to hard work and how you are to live God Almighty knows For I am sure I cannot find out though I have been thinking of nothing else for weeks and weeks past"  "Why should you suppose I have no money"  "Because I am sure of it I asked and found out all that you had to pay The servants too told me how openhearted you  was  so that you had given away all you had Shame on 'em for taking it say I You are not fit to live in this world And then to send me ten pounds  who have a house and home and hands to work But I'll be damned if I keep it"  "Nay but indeed you must"  "I will not I will not I would not forswear myself for all the money in the world And I have sworn it again and again So take it Nay here take it If you don't I'll throw it down in the road and let the first that comes find it for I'll not forswear myself So pray now I beg for God's sake you will take it"  I found it was in vain to contend with him he was too determined and had taken this oath in the simplicity of his heart that it might not be possible for him to recede I therefore accepted the money but I endeavoured having received it to satisfy his oath to persuade him to take a part of it back again My efforts were fruitless "He had three half crowns" he told me "in his pocket  which would serve his turn till he could get more and he had left five guineas at home so that there was no fear his wife and children should want"  Happy enviable state of independance When a man and his wife and family possessed of five guineas are so wealthy that they are in no fear of want  Having complied because I found though I could equal him in bodily activity I could not vanquish him in generosity I requested him to return to the place we just had passed through and take up his lodging  He replied "To be sure he was a little tired for he had set out a good hour after me and I had come at a rare rate Not but that he could keep his ground though I was so good a footman but that it did not become him to make himself my companion"  "Companion" said I "Why are not you going back to Bath"  "No I have taken my leave of it I shall go and set up my rest in London I have not been sharking to my master I thought of it some time since and gave him fair notice and more than that I got him another man in my room which is all he could demand and I hope he will serve him as honestly as I have done"  "What would you forsake your wife and children"  "Forsake my wife and children"  There was a mixed emotion of indignant sorrow and surprize in his countenance  "I did not think Mr Trevor you could have believed me to be such a base villain"  "I do not believe it I never could believe it I spoke thoughtlessly I saw you were too happy together for that to be possible"  "Forsake my dear Sally and our Bill  and Bet and No I'd sooner take up my axe and chop off my hand There is not another man in England has such a wife I have seen bad ones enough and for the matter of that bad husbands too But that's nothing If you will do me the favour I should take it kind of you to let me walk with you and keep you company now night is coming on to the next town and then you may take some rest and wait for the stage in the morning I shall make my way and find you out I suppose fast enough in London"  "Are you then determined to go to town"  "Yes it is all settled I told Sally and she did cry a little to be sure but she was soon satisfied She knows me and I never in my life found her piggish God be her holy keeper"  "Why then come along We'll go  together If I ride you shall ride if you walk so will I"  "Will you God bless you You know how to win a man's heart There is not so good or so brave a fellow I mean gentleman upon the face of the earth damn me if there is I beg your pardon Indeed I do But you force it out of one One can't remember to keep one's distance with you However I will try to be more becoming"  The manner of Clarke was more impressive than his words though they generally speaking were not unapt  We pursued our way together mutually gratified by what had passed Perhaps there is no sensation that so cheers and sooths the soul as the knowledge that there are other human beings whose happiness seems knitted and bound up with our own willing to share our fate receive our favours and whenever occasion  offers to return them ten fold And the pleasure is infinitely increased when those who are ambitious of being beloved by us seem to feel and acknowledge that we have more amply the power of conferring than even of receiving happiness  CHAP VI  A FOOLISH GUIDE AND A GLOOMY NIGHT THE FEARS AND DANGERS OF DARKNESS CASUAL LIGHTS LEAD TO ERROR AND MISHAP  WHILE we had been discussing the above points we had sat down and rose to pursue our journey as soon as we had brought them to a conclusion We were on the borders of a forest As we proceeded we came up with a countryman who enquiring where we were going told us that by striking a little out of the road we might save half a mile  We had nine miles to travel to the inn at which the stage coaches stopped and were very willing Clarke especially to shorten the way The countryman said he was going part of the road and that the remainder was so plain it could not be mistaken Accordingly we put ourselves under his guidance  The sun had been down by this time nearly an hour and a half The moon gave some light but the wind was rising she was continually obscured by thick swiftflying clouds and our conductor advised us to push on for it was likely to be a very bad night  In less than a quarter of an hour his prophecy began to be fulfilled The rain fell and at intervals the opposing clouds and currents of air aided by the impediments of hills and trees gave us a full variety of that whistling roaring and howling which is heard in high winds  The darkness thickened upon us and  I was about to request the countryman to lead us to some village or even barn for shelter when he suddenly struck into another path and bidding us good night again told us "we could not miss our road" We could not see where he was gone to and though we repeatedly called we called in vain he was too anxious to get shelter himself to heed our anxiety and was soon out of hearing  So long as we could discern the path we were in appeared to be tolerably beaten but we now could no longer trace any path for it was too dark for the ground to have any distinct colour We had skirted the forest and our only remaining guide was a hedge on our left  In this hedge we placed our hopes We followed its direction I know not how long till it suddenly turned off at an angle and we found ourselves as far as we could conjecture from the intervening lights and the strenuous efforts  we made to discover the objects around us on the edge of some wild place probably a heath with hills and consequently deep vallies perhaps streams of water and precipices  We paused we knelt down examined with our eyes and felt about with our hands to discover whether we yet were in a path but could find none  We continued our consultation till we had begun to think it advisable to return once more guided by the hedge Yet this was not only very uncertain but the idea of a retrograde motion was by no means pleasant  While we were in this irresolute dilemma we thought we saw a light that glimmered for a moment and as suddenly disappeared We watched I know not how long and again saw it twinkle though as we thought in something of a different direction Clarke said it was a Will o'the whisp I replied it might  be one but as it seemed the only chance we had my advice was to continue our walk in that direction in hopes that if it were a light proceeding from any house or village it would become more visible as we approached  We walked on I know not how far and then paused but discovered no more of the light We walked again again stood still and looked on every side of us either for the light or any other object but we could see nothing distinctly The obscure forms around us had varied their appearance and whether they were hills or clouds or what they were we could not possibly discover though the first we still thought was the most probable  By this time we had no certain recollection of which way we had come or to what point we were directing our course We were continually in doubt now pausing now conjecturing now proceeding  We continued to wander we knew not whither Sometimes it appeared we went up hill and sometimes down We had stepped very cautiously and therefore very slowly had warned each other continually to be careful and had not dared to take twenty steps at a time without mutually enquiring to know if all were safe  We continued environed as it were by the objects that most powerfully inspire fear by the darkness of night the tumult of the elements the utter ignorance of where we were or by what objects surrounded and the dejectedness which our situation inspired Thieves and assassins might be at our back and we could not hear them gulphs rocks or river in our front or on either side and we could not see them The next step might plunge us headlong we knew not whither  These fears were not all imaginary  Finding the ground very uneven on a sudden and stumbling dangerously myself I stood stillI did not hear my companionI called I received no answer I repeated in a louder tone "Clarke Where are you "Still no answer  I then shouted with all the fear that I felt and heard a faint response that seemed to be beneath me and at a prodigious distance It terrified yet it relieved We had spoken not three minutes before I stood silent in hopes he would speak again but my fears were too violent to remain so long I once more called and he replied with rather a louder voice which lessened the apparent distance "Take care You'll dash yourself to pieces"  "Are you hurt" said I  "I hope not much" returned he "For God's sake take care of yourself"  "Can you walk"  "I shall be able presently I believe"  "How can I get to you"  "I don't know"  "Stay where you are and I will try"  "For God in heaven's sake don't You'll certainly break your neck I suppose I am in a chalk pit or at the bottom of a steep crag"  "I will crawl to you on my hands and knees"  "Good God You will surely kill yourself"  "Nothing can be more dangerous than to lie here on the wet ground We must only take care to keep within hearing of each other"  While I spoke I began to put my crawling expedient in practice still calling to Clarke every half minute and endeavouring to proceed in the direction of his voice  I found the rough impediments around me increase till presently I came to one  that was ruder than the rest I crawled upon it sustained by my knees and right hand and stretching forward with my left I groped but felt nothing I cautiously laid my belly to the ground and stretched out my other arm Still it was vacancy I stretched a little more violently feeling forward and on each side and I seemed to be projected upon a point my head and shoulders inclining over a dark abyss which the imagination left unfathomable  I own I felt terror and the sensation certainly was not lessened when making an attempt to recover my position and go back my support began to give way My effort to retreat was as violent as my terror but it was too late The ground shook loosened and with the struggle I made carrying me with it toppled headlong down  What the height that I fell was I have no means of ascertaining for the  heath on which we were wandering abounds with quarries and precipices but either it was in fact or my fears made it prodigious  Had this expedient been proposed under such circumstances as the only probable one of bringing me and Clarke together again who would not have shuddered at it Yet though it is true I received a violent shock I know of no injury that it did me  As soon as I recovered my presence of mind I replied to Clarke whose questions were vehement he having heard me fall After mutual enquiry we found we were both once more upon our legs and had escaped broken bones Though they had been severely shaken Clarke's much the most violently  But where were we now How should we discover Perhaps in a stone quarry or lime pit Perhaps at the edge of waters It might be we had fallen down  only on the first bank or ridge of a quarry and had a precipice ten fold more dreadful before us  While we were conjecturing the stroke of a large clock brought whizzing in the wind struck full upon our ear We listened with the most anxious ardour The next stroke was very very faint a different current had carried it a different way and with all our eager attention we could not be certain that we heard any more Yet though we had lost much time and our progress had been excessively tedious it could not be two o'clock in the morning It might indeed very probably be twelve  The first stroke of the clock made us conjecture it came from some steeple or hall tower at no very great distance The second carried our imaginations we knew not whither We had not yet recovered courage enough to take more steps than were necessary to come to each  other and while we were considering during an intermitting pause of the roaring of the wind we distinctly heard a cur yelp  Encouraged by this we immediately hallooed with all our might The wind again began to chafe and swell and seemed to mock at our distress Still we repeated our efforts whenever the wind paused but instead of voices intending to answer our calls we heard shrill whistlings which certainly were produced by men  Could it be by good men By any but night marauders intent on mischief but disturbed and alarmed They were signals indubitably for we shouted again they were again given and were then repeated from another quarter at least if they were not they were miraculously imitated by the dying away of the wind  In a little while we again heard the cur yelp and immediately afterward a  howling which was so mingled with the blast that we could not tell whether it were the wind itself the yelling of a dog or the agonizing cries of a human voice but it was a dreadfully dismal sound We listened with perturbed and deep attention and it was several times repeated with increasing uncertainty confusion and terror  What was to be done My patience was exhausted Danger itself could no longer detain me and I told Clarke I was determined to make toward the village or whatever the place was from whence dangerous and doubtful as they were these various sounds proceeded  Finding me resolute he was very earnest to have led the way and when I would not permit him he grasped me by the hand and told me that if there were pitfalls and gulphs and if I did go down unless he should have strength  enough to save me we would go down together  CHAP VII  DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS IN SUCCESSION A PLACE OF HORRORS AND ITS INMATES A DIALOGUE WORTHY OF THE PLACE  AS we were cautiously and slowly taking step by step and as new conjectures crossed us stopping to consider we again saw a dancing light but more distinctly though as we imagined not very near We repeated our calls but whether they were or were not heard they were not answered We ventured however to quicken our pace for we continued at intervals to catch the light  Presently we saw the light no more and a considerable time again elapsed which was spent in wandering as this or that supposition directed us till at last  suddenly and very unexpectedly we perceived lines and forms that convinced us they appertained to some house or mansion and as it appeared to us a large one We approached it examined shouted and endeavoured to discover which was the entrance But all was still all dark all closed  We continued our search on the outside till at length we came to a large gate that was open which we entered and proceeded to some distance till we arrived at a door that evidently belonged to an outhouse or detached building It was shut and feeling about we found that the key was in the lock We had little hesitation in profiting by the accident We had been shelterless too long and the circumstances pleaded too powerfully for us to indulge any scruples and accordingly we entered  We had no sooner put our heads within the door but we found ourselves assaulted with a smell or rather stench  so intolerable as almost to drive us back but the fury of the elements and perhaps the less delicate organs of Clarke who seemed determined to profit by the shelter we had obtained induced us to brave an inconvenience which though excessively offensive at first became less the longer we continued  Groping about we discovered some barrels and lumber behind which there was straw Here we determined to lie down and rest our bruised and aching bones Our cloaths had been drenched and dried more than once in the course of the night and they were at present neither wet nor dry  We had scarcely nestled together in our straw before we again heard the yelping of the cur arid presently afterward the same dismal howls repeated To these at no great distance succeeded the shrill whistling signals Our imaginations had been so highly wrought up that they were apt at horrible  conjectures and for my part my own was at that moment very busily employed in conjuring them up  In the very midst of this activity we heard the voices of men walking round the building They again whistled with a piercing shrillness and though we heard nothing distinctly yet we caught tones that were coarse rude and savage and words that denoted anger and anxiety for the perpetration of some dark purpose no doubt corresponding to the fierce and threatening sounds we heard  They approached One of them had a lanthorn He came up to the door and finding it open boisterously shut it with a broad and bitter curse against the carelessness of some man whose name he pronounced for leaving it open and eternally damning others for being so long in doing their business  We were now locked in and we soon heard no more of the voices  In spite of all these alarms the moment they ceased our condition comparing it with the tempest and difficulties without seemed to be much bettered and we once more prepared ourselves for sleep while fear gave place to fatigue  Our rest was of short duration We began indeed to slumber but I was presently disturbed by Clarke whom I found shaking in the most violent agitation and horror that I ever witnessed in any human being  I asked "what is the matter"  He replied with a groan  I was awakened from wild slumbers of my own and strongly partook of his sensations but endeavoured however to rouze him to speech and recollection Again and again I asked "what have you heard What ails you"  It was long before he could utter an articulate sound At last shaking more violently as he spoke and with inexpressible  horror in his voice he gasping said "A dead hand"  "Where"  "I felt itI had hold of itIt is now at my neck"  For a moment I paused not daring to stretch out my arm and examine I trembled in sympathy with him At length I ventured  Never shall I forget the sensation I experienced when to my full conviction I actually felt a cold dead hand between my fingers  I was suffocated with horror I struggled to overcome it again it seized me and I sunk half entranced  At this very instant the shrill sound of the whistle rung piercing through the dismal place in which we were imprisoned It was answered The same hoarse voices once more were heard but in tones fifty fold more dire  One terror combated the other and  we were recalled to some sense of distinguishing and understanding We lay silent not daring to breathe when we heard the door unlock Our feelings will not readily be conceived while the following dialogue passed  "What a damned while you have kept us waiting such a night as this"  "What ails the night It is a special good night for our trade"  "What the devil have you been about"  About Doing our business to be sure and doing it to some purpose I tell you Is not the night as bad for us as for you Who had the best of it do you think What had you to do but to keep on the scout"  "How came you to leave the door open and be dmn'd to you"  "Who left the door open Jack Dingyface We left the key in it indeed for such lubbers as you to pass in  and out while we had all the work to do and all the danger to boot"  "Who do you call lubber Bullcalf We have had as much to do as yourselves There has been an alarm given for we have heard noises and hallooing all night For my part I don't much like it We shall be smoked nay it is my belief we are already and I have a great mind to decamp and leave the country"  " You are always in a panic Who is to smoke us"  "Well mark my words it will come upon us when we least think of it"  "Think of Hold up the Ianthorn Come heave in the sackWe were dmn'd fools for taking such a henhearted fellow among us Lift the sack an end Why don't you lend a hand and keep it steady while I untie it Do you think a dead man can stand on his  legs Dmn my body the fool is afraid he should bite"  "You are a hardened dog Randal blst me"  "Come tumble the body out Lay hold Here Heave this way So that will do We may leave him He will not run away His journey is over He will travel no farther tonight He can't say however but we have provided him with a lodging"  "Dmn me where do you expect to go to"  "To bed It's high time"  "I never heard such a dare devil dog in all my life"  "Don't let that trouble you for you will never be like me"  "What is that"  "What is what"  "I saw a head"  "Where"  "Behind the tub"  "What then Is there any wonder in seeing a head or a body either in this place"  "Nay but a living head"  "A living ass"  "I am sure I saw the eyes move"  "Ah whitelivered lout I wonder what the devil made such a quaking pudding poltroon think of taking to our trade Come I am hungry let us go into the kitchen and get some grub and then to bed Pimping Simon here will see his grandmother's ghost if we stay five minutes longer  CHAP VIII  THE SCENE CONTINUED AND OUR TERRORS INCREASED AN INTERESTING DIALOGUE THAT UNRAVELS THE MYSTERY THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ACQUAINTANCE  HERE to our infinite ease they quitted us went through an inner door that led to the house locked it after them and left us not only with the dead hand not only with the dead body but in the most dismal human slaughterhouse that murder and horror ever constructed or ever conceived Such were our impressions and such under the same circumstances they would have been perhaps of the bravest man or mankiller that ever existed Alexander and Caesar themselves would have shook lying as we lay hearing what we heard and seeing what we saw for by the light of the lanthorn we beheld limbs  and bones and human skeletons on every side of us I repeat horror had nothing to add  The dancing lights we had seen the shrill signals and the dreadful howls that we had heard were now no longer thought mysterious It was no  ign's fatuus  but the lanthorn of these assassins no dog or wolf baying the moon but the agonizing yells of murder  The men were four in number The idea of attacking them several times suggested itself Nor was it so much overpowered by the apprehension of the arms with which I concluded such men must be provided as that my mind was rendered irresolute by the dreadful pictures real and imaginary which had passed through my mind  Clarke brave as he was had lost all his intrepidity in this golgotha this place of skulls the very scent of which knowing whence it proceeded was abhorrent  No it was not their arms nor their numbers but these fears that induced me when he that saw my eyes move was in danger of giving the alarm to close them and profiting by the fellow's sympathetic terror counterfeit the death by which I was environed  Here then we were And must we here remain To sleep was impossible Must we rise and grapple with the dead trample on their limbs and stumble over their unearthed bones in endeavouring to get out  Neither could we tell what new horrors were in store for us Who had not heard of trap doors sliding wainscots and other murderous contrivances And could they be now forgotten Impossible All the phantoms memory could revive or fancy could create were realized and assembled  Of the two I certainly had more the use of my understanding than Clarke  but I was so absorbed in the terrors which assailed me on every side that I was intent on them only and forgot while the lanthorn glimmered its partial and dull rays to consider the geography of the place or to plan the means of escape till the moment the men were departing when I caught a glimpse of what I imagined to be a window facing me  As soon as our fears would permit us we began in low and cautious whispers to communicate our thoughts Clarke was pertinaciously averse to rise and hurtle in the dark with the bones of the dead By the intervening medium of the straw he had pushed away the terrific hand and was determined he said to lie still till daylight should return and prevent him from treading at random on the horrible objects around him or stumbling over and being stretched upon a corpse  I had as little inclination to come in contact with dead hands cadaverous bodies and dissevered joints as he could have yet was too violently tormented to remain quiet and suffer myself to be preyed on by my imagination Had I resigned myself to it without endeavouring to relieve it by action it would have driven me frantic I half rose sat considering ventured to feel round me and shrunk back with inexpressible terror from the first object that I touched Again I ruminated again ventured to feel and again and again shivered with horrible apprehensions  Use will reconcile us to all situations Experience corrects fear emboldens ignorance and renders desire adventurous The builder will walk without dread on the ridge of a house while the timid spectator standing below is obliged to turn his eyes away or tumble headlong down and be dashed to pieces in imagination  Repeated trials had a similar effect on me they rendered me more hardy and I proceeded as nearly as I could guess toward the window touching treading on and encountering I knew not what subject every moment to new starts of terror and my heart now sinking now leaping as the sudden freaks and frights of fancy seized upon me  After the departure of the desperadoes we had heard various noises in the adjoining house among others the occasional ringing of a chamber bell While I was thus endeavouring to explore my way arrested by terror at every step as I have been describing we again heard sounds that approached more nearly and presently the innerdoor once more opened and a livery servant bearing two lighted candles came in followed by a man with an apron tied round  him having a kind of bib up to his chin and linen sleeves drawn over his coat  The master for so he evidently was had a meagre wan countenance and a diminutive form The servant had evidently some trepidation  "Do not be afraid Matthew" said the master "You will soon be accustomed to it and you will then laugh at your present timidity Unless you conquer your fears you will not be able to obey my directions in assisting me and consequently will not be fit for your place and you know you cannot get such good wages in any other"  "I will do my best sir" said the servant "but I can't say but for the first time it is a little frightful"  "Mere prejudice Matthew I am studying to gain knowledge which will be serviceable to mankind and that you must perceive will be doing good"  "Yes sir"  "Reach me those instrumentsNow lift up the body and turn the head a little this wayWhy do you tremble Are you afraid of the dead"  "Not much sir"  "Lift boldly then"  "Yes sir"  As the servant turned round half stupefied with his fears he beheld me standing with my eyes fixed watchful and listening with my whole soul for the interpretation of these enigmas The man stared gaped turned pale and at last dropped down overcome with his terrors  The master was amazed and perceiving which way the servant's attention had been directed looked round His eye caught mine He stood motionless His pale face assumed a deathlike hue and for a few moments he seemed to want the power of utterance  Clarke had remained astonished and confounded a silent spectator of the scene But there was now light and though the objects of horror were multiplied in reality they were less numerous to the imagination Seeing the fear of the servant observing his fall and remarking the gentle and feeble appearance of the master armed though he was with murderous instruments Clarke was now rising determined to come to action His proceeding disturbed our mutual amazement He was on his legs and as I perceived advancing with hostile intentions  The dialogue I had heard and the objects which I had distinctly seen and examined had by this time unravelled the whole mystery I discovered that we were in the dissectingroom of an anatomist Clarke was clenching his fist and preparing to direct a blow at the operator and I had but just time to step forward  arrest his arm and impede its progress "Be quiet" said I "Clarke we have been mistaken"  "For God's sake who are you gentlemen" said the owner of the mansion recovered in part from his apprehensions by my pacific interference  "We are benighted travellers sir" answered I "who got entrance into this place by accident and have ourselves been suffering under false but excessive fear Pray sir be under no alarm for we are far from intending you injury"  He made no immediate reply and I continued  "Fear I find though she has indeed a most active fancy has no understanding otherwise among the innumerable conjectures with which my brain has been busied within this hour the truth would certainly have suggested itself But instead of supposing I was transported to the benignant regions of science I  thought myself certain of being in the purlieus of the damned in the very den of murder"  My language manner and tone of voice relieved him from all alarm and he said with a smile "This is a very whimsical accident"  "You would think so indeed sir" replied I "if you knew but half of the horrible images on which we have been dreaming But it was distress that drove us to take shelter here and if there be any village or if not even any barn in which we could take a little rest till daylight we should be exceedingly obliged to you for that kind assistance which from your love of science and from the remarks I have heard you make to your servant I am persuaded you will be very willing to afford"  By this time the servant was recovered from his fright and on his legs "Go Matthew" said the master "and  call up one of the maids" And turning to me he added "Be kind enough to follow me sir with your companion I doubt if you could procure either lodging or refreshment within three miles of the place and I shall therefore be very happy in supplying you with both"  We obeyed I highly delighted with the benevolent and hospitable manner of our host and Clarke most glad to escape from a scene which no explanation had yet reconciled to his feelings or notions of good and evil  CHAP IX  A REVIEW OF EMOTIONS AND MISTAKES REPO  AFTER FATIGUE SINGULAR THOUGHTS CONCERNING PROPERTY BENEVOLENCE ON A LARGE SCALE A PROPOSAL ACCEPTED WHICH GREATLY ALTERS THE FACE OF AFFAIRS SKETCHES OF WAR THE HERO THE RAPTURES OF A POET PROJECTS AND OPINIONS RELATIVE TO LAW THOUGHTS ON THE SCIENCE OF SURGERY  IN the relation of this adventure I have given a picture not of things as they were afterward discovered to be but as they appeared to us at the time reflected through the medium of consternation and terror We had been powerfully prepared for these by the previous circumstances Our imaginations had been strongly preyed upon by our distress by the accidents of falling and by the mingled noises we had heard proceeding from the churchyard robbers from the  villagedogs and curs disturbed by them and us and from the whistling roaring and howling which are so common to high gusts of wind and so almost distracting to a mind already in a state of visionary deception and alarm There was indeed enough to excite that wild and uncontroulable dread which rushed upon us every moment Mingled as they were with darkness ignorance and confusion the succeeding objects were actually horrible  Thus the discourse and dialect as well as the voices of the men employed to furnish dead bodies were gross and rude and the timidity and prejudices of those who probably were young in the employment contrasted with the jokes vulgar sarcasms and oaths of the boisterous and hardened adepts though habitual to such people gave a colouring to the preceding circumstances that so confirmed and realized our fears as not to allow us  the leisure to doubt To repeat such coarse colloquies and vulgar ribaldry is no pleasing task except as a history of the manners of such men and of the emotions with which on this occasion they were accompanied These indeed made the repetition necessary  It is likewise true that in their own opinion these men were more or less criminal and guilt always assumes an audacity and fierceness which it does not feel They were not intentionally acting well but were doing that which they supposed to be a deed of desperate wickedness for selfish purposes Had the consent of any one of them when dying been asked to have his body dug up and dissected he would have heard the proposal with detestation Consequently they deceived us the more effectually for they had the manners of that guilt which as far as intention was concerned they actually possessed  Add to this the spectacle of a dissectingroom seen indistinctly by the partial glimmerings of a lanthorn Whoever has been in such a place will recognise the picture Here preparations of arms pendent in rows with the vessels injected There legs feet and other limbs In this place the intestines in that membranes cartilages muscles with the bones and all their varieties of clothing in every imaginary mangled form These things ought not to be terrible but to persons of little reflection and not familiarized to them they always are  Escaped from this scene restored as it were to human intercourse and encouraged by the kindness of our host whose name was Evelyn our pulse began to grow temperate and our imaginations to relax and gravitate toward common sense We took the refreshment that was brought us and conversed during  the meal with Mr Evelyn partly on the incidents of the night and partly in answering a few questions which he put with a feeling that denoted a desire rather to afford us aid than to gratify his own curiosity After which as we were weary and he disposed to pursue his nocturnal researches we immediately retired to rest Clarke was full to overflowing with cogitation but fro the present it was too large or rather too confused for utterance and it soon overpowered and sunk him into sleep  For my own part my mind was too much alive to be immediately overcome by fatigue I lay revolving in thought the incidents of the night which led me into reveries on the singular character of Mr Evelyn on my own forlorn state on the bleak prospect before me and on Olivia  This last train of thinking was not easily dismissed At length however both  mind and body were so overwearied that I fell into an unusually profound sleep from which I did not awake till Clarke who had risen two hours before came between nine and ten o'clock and rouzed me to inform me that breakfast was waiting and that our host expected my company  While I was dressing he told me that Mr Evelyn had been making many enquiries concerning me and apologized himself with marks of apprehension lest he should have done wrong while he owned that he had answered these interrogatories by relating such particulars as he knew  We then went down and among other conversation at breakfast Mr Evelyn remarked that he understood from Clarke we had no urgent business which would make a day sooner or a day later of any material consequence and he therefore particularly requested we would  delay our departure till the next morning The reason he gave was a kind expression of interest which what he had heard from my companion had excited and a desire not of inquisitive prying but evidently of benevolence to be as fully informed of my history as I should think proper to make him  There was something soothing both in the request and in his manner which induced me to readily comply Poor Clarke excepted I seemed as if no human being took any concern in my fate and to discover that there was yet a man who was capable of sympathizing with me was like filling a painful vacancy of the heart and afforded something of an incoherent hope of relief  Not that I was prepared to ask or even to accept favours I had rather entertained a kind of indignant sense of injury against any one who should presume to make me his debtor or to suppose I was incapable  of not rather enduring all extremities than so to subject and degrade myself as in my own apprehension I should do by any such condescension  After breakfast Mr Evelyn desired me to walk with him that we might converse the more freely when alone He then repeated what Clarke had told him gave a strong and affecting picture of the overflowing kindness and compassion with which my companion had related all he knew and proceeded afterward to speak of himself in the following terms  "I am a man Mr Trevor engaged in a trust which I find it very difficult conscientiously to discharge I have an estate of fifteen hundred a year and am a creature whose real wants like those of other human creatures are few I live here surrounded by some hundreds of acres stored with fruits corn and cattle which the laws and customs of nations call mine But what is it that these  laws and customs mean That I am to devour the whole produce of thus much land The thing is impossible"  "Why impossible You may convert a hundred head of oxen into a service of gold plate Liveries laces equipage gilding garnishing and ten thousand other modes or fashionable wants which if not gratified render those that have them miserable would eat up all that ten thousand acres if you had them could yield Are you an Epicure You may so stew distill and titillate your palate with essences that a hecatomb shall be swallowed at every meal The means of devouring are innumerable and justified by general usage"  "General usage may be an apology but not a justification Happiness is the end of man but it cannot be single On the contrary the more beings are happy the greater is the individual happiness of each for each is a being of sympathies  and affections which are increased by being called into action It is the miserable mechanism of society which by giving legal possession of what is called property to the holders puts it absolutely and unconditionally in their disposal"  "Why the miserable mcchanism Are you a friend to the Agrarian system"  "By no means I was incorrect The mechanism is defective enough but I rather meant to have said the miserable moral system of society which allows every man to exercise his own caprice and thinks him guilty of no crime though he is in the daily habit of wasting that which might render numbers happy who are in absolute want"  "This is an evil of which the world has for ages been complaining but for which I see no remedy"  "You mean no remedy which laws or governments by the inflicting of pains  and penalties can afford at which to do them justice they have been much too often aiming but have as continually failed"  "And you imagine sir you are possessed of a more effectual prescription  "I dare not prescribe it would be an arrogant assumption of wisdom But I may advise a regimen which has numerous probabilities in its favour Yet what I must advise has been so many thousand times advised before that it seems impertinence to repeat it if not mockery To tell the rich that they seek enjoyment where it is not to be found that the parade by which they torment themselves to gain distinction renders them supremely ridiculous that their follies while they are oppressive and hateful to the poor are the topics of contempt and scandal even in their own circles and that the repetition of them inevitably proves that they  bring weariness disgust ruin pain and every human misery is mere commonplace declamation  "But there is one truth of which they have not been sufficiently reminded They are not as they have too long been taught to suppose themselves placed beyond the censure of the multitude It is found that the multitude can think and have discovered that the use the wealthy too often make of what they call their own is unjust tyrannical and destructive  "This memento will come to them with the greater force the oftener they are made to recollect that the spirit of enquiry is abroad that their voluptuous waste is daily becoming more odious and that simplicity of manners a benevolent oeconomy a vigorous munificence and a comprehensive philanthropy can alone redeem them and preserve that social order which every lover  of the human race delights to contemplate but of which they arrogate to themselves the merit of being the sole advocates  "It is the moral system of society that wants reform This cannot be suddenly produced nor by the efforts of any individual but it may be progressive and every individual may contribute though some much more powerfully than others The rich in proportion as they shall understand this power and these duties will become peculiarly instrumental for poverty by being subjected to continual labour is necessarily ignorant and it is well known how dangerous it is for ignorance to turn reformer  "Let the rich therefore awake let them encourage each other to quit their pernicious frivolities and to enquire without fear or prejudice how they may secure tranquillity and promote happiness and let them thus avert those miseries at  which they so loudly and so bitterly rail but into which by their conduct a majority of them is so ready to plunge  "The intentions of those among them who think the most are excellent to assert the contrary is equally false and absurd But when they expect to promote peace and order by irritating each other against this or that class of men however mistaken those men may be and by disseminating a mutual spirit of acrimony between themselves and their opponents they act like madmen and if they do not grow calm forgiving and kind the increasing fury of the mad many will overtake them"  "They are like the brethren of Dives they pay but little regard to Moses and the prophets"  "Well Mr Trevor you will own at least that since I can talk with all this seeming wisdom a small share of the practice  will be becoming in me and what you and all mankind would expect"  "I may but not all mankind There are some who pretend to be so learned in what they call the depravity of human nature that after having heard you speak thus admirably in favour of virtue they would think it more than an equal chance that you are one of the wickedest of men"  "Oh with respect to that some of my very neighbours do not scruple to affirm that I am so But I repeat I have what I consider as a large estate in trust and it is a serious and a sacred duty imposed upon me to seek how it may be best employed I seldom am satisfied with the means which offer themselves and am therefore always in quest of new"  "I wonder at that sir with your system Have you no poor in the country"  "O yes enough to grieve any penetrable heart But I know no task more  difficult than that of administering to their wants without encouraging their vices Of these wants I consider instruction as the greatest and to that I pay the greatest attention Food cloathing and disease are imperious necessities and to leave them unprovided would be guilt incredible to speculation did we not see it in hourly practice But the poor are so misled by the opinions they are taught to hold and the oppressions to which they are subject that by relieving these most urgent wants we are in danger of teaching them idleness drunkenness and servility I do them the little good that I can most willingly but I consider the diffusion of knowledge by which that which I call the moral system of mankind is to be improved as the most effectual means of conferring happiness Are you of that opinion"  "I certainly am"  "Then I cannot but think you intend to promote this beneficial plan"  "I scarcely know my own intentions They are unsettled incoherent and the dreams of delirium rather than the system of a sage such as you have imagined"  "I wish we had been longer acquainted and were intimate enough to induce you to relate your history and confide your thoughts to me as to a friend or if you please as to one who holds it a duty to offer aid whenever he imagines it will answer a good end"  "To offer aid is kind but there are very few cases in which he that receives it is not mean and degraded You however are actuated by a generous spirit and as you are inclined to listen I will very willingly inform you of the chief incidents of a life that has already been considerably checkered and the future  prospects of which are sufficiently gloomy"  After this preface I began my narrative and succinctly related the principal of those events with which the reader already is acquainted Nor did the state of my feelings and the strong sense of injury which was ever present to my imagination when I came to recapitulate my adventures since I first left college suffer me to colour with a negligent or a feeble hand  Some of the incidents necessarily induced me to mention Olivia and betray my sentiments in part which the questions of Mr Evelyn put with kindness delicacy and interest that was evidently unaffected induced me at length wholly to reveal with all the tenderness and the vehemence of passion  I was encouraged or rather impelled to this confidence by the emotions which Mr Evelyn betrayed in his countenance  voice and manner His hopes his fears and his affections were so much in unison with my own his eye so often glistened and his cheek so frequently glowed that it was impossible for the heart not to open all its recesses and pour out not only its complaints but its very follies  Of all the pleasures in which the soul of man most delights that of sympathy is surely the chief It can unite and mingle not only two but ten millions of spirits as one Could a world be spectators of the sorrows of Lear a world would with one consent participate in them so omnipotent is the power of sympathy It is the consolation of poverty it is the cordial of friendship it is the essence of love Pride and suspicion are its chief enemies and they are the vices that engender the most baneful of the miseries of man  Mr Evelyn remained after I had ended for some time in deep meditation  now and then casting his eyes toward me and then taking them away as if fearful of offending my sensibility and again falling into thought At length fixing them more firmly and with an open benignity of countenance he thus broke silence  "I have been devising my noble young friend allow me to call you so by what means I should best make myself understood to you and how most effectually prevail on you to contribute to my happiness and to those great ends for which souls of ardour like yours are so highly gifted I have already sketched my principles concerning the use and abuse of property One of those rare occasions on which it may be excellently employed now presents itself You are in pursuit of science by which a world is to be improved To the best of my ability I follow the same track but I have the means which you want You have too little I have too much It is my province  and if you consent as I hope and trust you will it will be my supreme pleasure to supply the deficiency I am acquainted with the delicacy of your sentiments but I am likewise acquainted with the expansion of your heart and with its power of rising superior to the false distinctions which at present regulate society I might assume the severe tone of the moralist and urge your compliance with my request as a duty but I would rather indulge what may perhaps be the foible of immature virtue and follow the affectionate impulse which binds me to you as my friend and brother Beside these are vibrations with which I am persuaded your warm and kindred heart will more readily harmonize In youth we willingly obey impetuous sensations but reluctantly listen to the flow and frigid deductions of reason when they are in contradiction to our habits and prejudices I therefore  repeat you are my friend and brother and I conjure you by those generous and magnanimous feelings of which your whole life proves you are so eminently susceptible not to wound me by refusal Do not consider me as the acquaintance of a day for by hearing your history I have travelled with you through life and seem as if I had been the inmate of your bosom even from your years of infancy No far from being strangers we have been imbibing similar principles similar views and similar affections Our souls have communed for years and rejoice that the time at length is come in which that individual intercourse for which they may most justly be said to have panted is opened If you object if you hesitate if you suspect me you will annihilate the purest sensations which these souls have mutually cherished you will wrong both yourself and me"  There was an emanating fervor in the  look deportment and the very gestures of Mr Evelyn that was irresistible It surpassed his language It led me out of myself It hurried me beyond the narrow limits of prejudices and prepossessions and transported me wherever it pleased I was no longer in mortal society surrounded by selfishness cunning and cowardly suspicions He had borne me on his wings and seated me among the Gods whose ministers were wisdom and beneficence I burst into exclamation  "I own it you are my friend you are my brother I accept your offers I will receive your benefits but I will retaliate"  I paused I felt the egotism of my own thoughts but could not subdue the torrent I continued inwardly to vow with the most vehement asseverations that I would repay every mark of kindness he should bestow fifty fold The  heart of man will not rest satisfied with inferiority and has recourse to a thousand stratagems a thousand deceptions to relieve itself of any such doubts which it entertains with impatience and pain  My own enthusiasm however was soon inclined to subside and I became ready to tax myself with that meanness and degradation which I had felt and expressed at the beginning of the discussion Of this the quick penetration of Mr Evelyn seemed to be aware and he so effectually counteracted these emotions that at length I abandoned all thoughts of resistance or of betraying those jealousies which would now have appeared almost insulting to a man who had displayed a spirit so disinterested  This subject being as it were dismissed our conversation recurred to my present affairs and future prospects and while we discoursed on these that which might  well at this period be called the malady of my mind exhibited itself Though I had as it were lost sight of Olivia though I knew not but she might at that time be a wife and though whatever her condition might be I had sufficient reason to fear that if she thought of me it was with pain not with love still that she must and should be mine was a kind of frantic conclusion with which I always consoled myself But for this purpose riches presented themselves as of the first necessity and riches themselves would be useless unless obtained with the rapidity rather of enchantment than by the ordinary progress of human events  I did not conceal this weakness from my friend and ventured to propose a plan on which I had previously been ruminating though I had foreseen no means of putting it in practice Every man had heard of the fortunes acquired in the east and of the wealth which had  been poured from the lap of India The army there was at all times open to men like myself youthful healthy and of education 'Tis true I had been of opinion that there were strong moral objections to this profession but these my more prevalent passions had lulled me into a forgetfulness of and I stated this as the most probable scheme for the accomplishment of my dearest hopes  Mr Evelyn anxious not to wound me where I was most vulnerable began by soothing my ruling passion and then proceeded to detail the physical chances of a ruined constitution of death and of failure and afterward to represent with unassuming but with stedfast energy the moral turpitude first of subjecting myself to the physical evils he had recited and next of hiring myself to enmity against nations I had never known and of becoming the assassin of people whom I had never seen and who had not had any  possible opportunity of doing me an injury or even of giving me an offence  The objections I started partly to defend the opinions I had begun with and partly because I felt myself loth to relinquish a plan by which my imagination had been flattered soon became very feeble but the interesting nature of the subject prolonged the discussion till it was nearly dinner time  In the course of this enquiry Mr Evelyn delineated the contemptible yet ridiculous arts which are employed to entrap men into the military service pourtrayed the inevitable depravity of their morals and gave a history of the feelings worthy of fiends which are engendered while they are trained to fix their bayonets load their pieces level them discharge them at men they had never seen before strike off the heads of these strangers with furious dexterity stab the ground in full gallop on which they are  supposed to have fallen and to lie helpless and commit habitual and innumerable murders in imagination that they may be hardened for actual slaughter  He afterward gave an enlightened and animated sketch of the abject condition of those who command these men of the total resignation which each makes of his understanding to that of the next in rank above him and of the arrogant the ignorant the turbulent the dangerous and the slavish spirit which this begets He finished the picture with a recapitulation of the innumerable and horrid miseries which everlastingly mark the progress of war which he painted with such force and truth that I recoiled from the contemplation of it with abhorrence  My feelings had been so agitated by this discourse that my imagination was thoroughly rouzed My former ideas concerning the enormous vices of war had not only been revived but increased  and though I began with debating the question I soon ceased to oppose so that my thoughts were rather busied in filling up the picture and collecting all its horrors than in apologizing for or denying their existence This was the temper of mind in which Mr Evelyn attending to his own concerns left me for a short time and my heart was so agonized by the recollection that this was a system to which men were still devoted and of which they were still in the headlong and hot pursuit that I then immediately and perhaps with less effort than I ever made on a similar occasion produced the following poem  THE HERO  ALL hail to the hero whom victory leads  Triumphant from fields of renown  From kingdoms left barren from plains drench'd in blood  And the sacking of many a fair town  His goredripping sword shall hang high in the hall  Revered for the havoc it spread  For the deaths it has dealt for the terrors it struck  And the torrents of blood it has shed  His banners in haughty procession shall ride  On Jehovah's proud altars unfurl'd  While anthems and priests waft to heaven his praise  For the slaughter and wreck of a world  Though widows and orphans together shall crowd  To gaze as at heaven's dread rod  And mutter their curses and mingle their tears  Invoking the vengeance of God  Though while bloated Revelry roars at his board  Where surfeiting hecatombs fume  Desolation and Famine shall howl and old Earth  Her skeleton hordes shall intomb  All ghastly and mangled from fields where they fell  With horrible groanings and cries  What though when he slumbers the dead from their graves  In dread visitation shall rise  Yet he among heroes exalted shall sit  And slaves to his splendor shall bend  And senates shall echo his virtues and kings  Shall own him their saviour and friend  Then hail to the hero whom victory leads  Triumphant from fields of renown  From kingdoms left barren from plains drench'd in blood  And the sacking of many a fair town  I was too full of my subject and poet like too much delighted with the verses I had so suddenly produced not to shew them immediately to Mr Evelyn  He seemed to do them even more than justice he read them again and again and each time with a feeling now of compassion now of amazement and now of horror that shewed how strongly  the picture had seized upon his soul The associations of misery which his imagination added were so forcible that tears repeatedly rolled down his cheeks To this more soothing trains of thought succeeded The pain of the past and the present was alleviated by a prospect of futurity Our minds rose to a state of mutual rapture excited by a foresight that the time was at length come in which men were awakening to a comprehensive view of their own mad and destructive systems that their vices began to be on the decline and no longer to be mistaken for the most splendid virtues as they had formerly been and that truth was breaking forth upon the world with most animating force and vigour  There have been few moments of my life in which I have experienced intellectual enjoyment with a pleasure so exquisite Clarke himself unused as his thoughts had been to explore the future and wrest happiness to themselves by anticipation  partook of our emotions and seemed in a state similar to those religious converts who imagine they feel that a new light is broke in upon them It was a happy afternoon It was a type of those which shall hereafter be the substitutes of the wretched resources of drinking obscene conversation and games of chance to which men have had recourse that they might rouze their minds being rather willing to suffer the extremes of misery than that dullness and inanity which they find still more insupportable  This incident united me and Mr Evelyn more intimately and powerfully than all that had passed The warmth with which he spoke of the benefits that society must receive from talents like mine dilated my heart Every man is better acquainted with his own powers and virtues than any other can possibly be and when they are discovered acknowledged and applauded instead of being denied or overlooked as is more  generally the case the pleasure he receives is as great as it is unusual  Our conversation after dinner reverted to the plans I was to pursue The law necessarily came under consideration and Mr Evelyn not having considered the subject under the same points of view as Turl had done was strongly in favour of that profession He foresaw in me a future Judge whose integrity should benefit and whose wisdom should enlighten mankind He conceived there could be no function more honourable more sacred or more beneficial An upright judge with his own passions and prejudices subdued attentive to the principles of justice by which alone the happiness of the world can be promoted and by the rectitude of his decisions affording precedent and example to future generations he considered as a character that must command the reverence and love of the human race  My imagination while he spoke was  not idle It helped to fill up the picture It placed me on the judgment seat It gave me the penetration of Solomon the benevolence of Zalcucus and the legislative soul of Alfred As usual it overstepped the probable with wonderful case and celerity Not only the objections of Turl disappeared but the jargon of the law its voluminous lumber with which I had been disgusted when reading the civilians at college and all my other doubts and disgusts vanished  Our inquiries accordingly ended with a determination that I should continue my journey to town should keep my terms at the Temple and should place myself as is customary under one of the most eminent barristers  This necessarily brought me to consider the expence and the moment that subject recurred I felt all the pain which could not but assault a mind like mine I had nurtured not only the haughtiness of independance but the supposition that  in my own extraordinary powers and gifts I possessed innumerable resources and at moments had encouraged those many extravagant flights with which the reader is already well acquainted  However after all that had passed and for the reasons that had been sufficiently urged I found it necessary to submit though by the concession my soul seemed to be subdued and its faculties to be shrunk and half withered It was an oppressive sensation that could not be shaken off yet that must be endured Such at least was my present conclusion  In the course of the evening Mr Evelyn at my request stated his reasons for pursuing his own course of studies and instanced a variety of facts which convinced me of the benefits to be derived from the science of surgery of the rash conclusions to which modern theorists and enquirers have been led and of the necessity there is that some practitioner equally well informed with themselves  but aware of the evil of false deductions should demonstrate the mischief of hasty assertion and that things which are only conjectural ought not to be given as indubitable  Of this nature he considered their hypotheses relating to the brain the nervous system the lymphatic fluid and other subjects concerning which many curious but hitherto equivocal facts have been the discovery of modern research  Mr Evelyn not only read all the best authors but went to London every winter and assiduously maintained an intercourse with the most able men attended their lectures was present at their operations and fully informed himself of their differences both in opinion and practice  But his frame was delicate a too long abode in London always occasioned pulmonary symptoms and experience taught him that his native air was more healthful and animating than any other The difficulties attending his studies were  greatly increased by his residence in the country but they were surmounted by his precaution and by the general favour which his benevolence secured to him among the neighbouring people Though there were not wanting some who considered him as a very strange if not a dangerous and a wicked man  It is a curious yet an astonishing and an afflicting speculation that men should be most prone to suspect and hate those who are most unwearied in endeavouring to remove their evils That a surgeon must be acquainted with the direction site and properties of the muscles arteries ligaments nerves and other parts before he can cut the living body with the least possible injury and that this knowledge can only be acquired by experience is a very plain proposition It is equally selfevident that a dead body is no longer subject to pain and that it certainly cannot be more disgraced by  the knife of a surgeon than by the gnawing of worms When will men shake off their infantine terrors and their idiotlike prepossessions  CHAP X  THE DEPARTURE EJACULATIONS PRESENT PLEASURES AND FUTURE HOPES A STRANGE DIALOGUE IN THE DARK AND A GENEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL DEFENDER  THE pleasure I this day received in the company of Mr Evelyn was uncommon the friendship with which he had inspired me was pure and the respect that my heart paid to his virtues was profound But eagerness of pursuit was my characteristic My plan being formed every moment of delay would have been torment and he entering into all my thoughts and sympathising with all my wishes prompted me to follow my bent  It was therefore agreed that I and my companion should depart by one of the coaches which would pass an inn at some distance in the morning A messenger was accordingly dispatched to take places in the first vacant coach arrangements for moneymatters were made with every possible delicacy by my friend the night passed away day returned and we departed  I will leave the reader to image to himself the crowding sensations that pressed upon my heart on this occasion the tumult of thought which incidents so sudden and unexpected produced and the feelings which mutually passed between me and my noble benefactor I shall live said I to acknowledge this in my old age I shall have a story to tell a man to describe and a friend to revere that will astonish and render common hearers incredulous But this was the language of my heart not of my tongue  That was dumb A pressure of the hand with eyes averted was all the utterance I had  A child and its mother were the only passengers beside ourselves The coach which was to be in London at ten that night rolled along they were asleep I was silent and poor Clarke was full of ejaculation  "If there be a good man on God's earth that gentleman is one He will find his road to heaven safe enough He will be among the sheep and sit on the right hand of God I hope I shall be in his company Though that can't be I am unworthy I may think myself happy to sit far enough lower down Not that I can say for I find the best people have the least pride Perhaps as it is in earth so it may be in heaven God send us all safe there together For my part I think that within these few weeks I am a different kind of a creature But what can  a poor carpenter do He must not speak to gentlefolk unless in the way of his work so he can have no sociability but with his poor neighbours And though some of them to be sure be as goodmeaning people as any on earth they are no better learned than himself so they can teach him nothing But I have happened on good luck so I have no right to complain And I am very sure in my own mind that there is good luck in store for us all for providence else would not have brought us and guided us where it did by such marvellous means so that while we thought we were breaking our necks and falling into the hands of murderers and being frightened out of our senses by the most shocking sights I must say that ever were seen we were all the while going straight on as fast as we could to good fortune So that it is true enough that man is blind but that God can see"  What pleasure does the mind of man take in solving all its difficulties How impatient is it that any thing should remain unexplained and how ready to elevate its own ignorance into mystery and miracle  To have remained longer silent while the honest heart of my companion was thus overflowing with kindness would have been no proof of the same excellent and winning quality in myself I encouraged his hopes in which I was very ready to participate My own pleasing dreams revived in full force and I presently ranged my cloudconstructed castles which I built pulled down and rebuilt with admirable facility and lorded it over my airy domains at will 'Tis a folly to rail at these domains for there are no earthly abodes that are half so captivating  Nothing worth mentioning happened on the road till we came to the last stage  but one where we changed horses at which time it was quite dark Our female companion and her child had been set down at Hungerford and two new passengers both ladies as soon as the horses were put to were shewn to the carriage  They had a footman who mounted the box and we soon learned from their discourse that they had been waiting for the nephew of the elder lady who was to have taken them in his phaeton but that they had been disappointed They had been on a visit and had been brought to Salthill in a gentleman's carriage which they had sent back While the coach had stopped I had fallen into a doze but awoke when it began to move again and when I heard the voices of females conversing  The old lady spoke most and complained of the rudeness of her nephew in subjecting them to the inconvenience of  a stagecoach or of waiting they knew not how long till posthorses should come in which as they were informed would be tired and unfit for more work it happening that there was a great run at that time on the Bath road  The reader will presently understand that they were people of real fashion and the eldest lady spoke of persons and things which denoted that high life was familiar to her This gave Clarke a new opportunity of wondering how he a poor carpenter came into such company which he directly expressed to me with the simplicity and undisguise that are common to such characters  The old lady who had before signified her chagrin at the expedient to which her nephew had reduced her did not find her pride soothed when she learned that she was in company with carpenters for it soon appeared that she considered  me and my companion as familiar acquaintances of the same rank  Her young friend was likewise led into this error and when the former began to express her disgust too freely to accord with the feelings of the latter she interrupted her with saying  "Ayez la bonté madame de parler Franqois"  "Be kind enough madam to speak French"  The old lady complied and a conversation ensued which certainly will neither surprise nor move the reader so much as it did me Should he ask how I as a man of honor could suffer them to remain in the deception of imagining I did not understand them let him wait till he knows enough to surmise what the emotions were that were in a moment kindled in my bosom At first indeed they were but dark and improbable conjectures but dark as they were they shook my whole frame  The dialogue that ensued soon testified that the old lady was in no very complacent temper of mind Her beginning sentences expressed dissatisfaction were sarcastic and evidently glanced at her young companion whose replies were mild and conciliating But not satisfied with indirect reproach her assailant still speaking French continued her interrogatories to the following effect  "And are you still determined Miss to persist in your obstinate refusal of his lordship"  "Let me intreat you dear madam not to enter on that subject again"  "Oh to be sure You very kindly intreat me to torment myself as much as I please so that I do not trouble you"  "How can you madam accuse me of such cruelty Is it just Am I indeed of such a nature"  "Yes indeed are you Miss however  you may flatter yourself It is nothing but perversity that can make you trifle with the honor and happiness of your familyNow you are silent Your fine spirit no doubt disdains to reply"  "What can I say"  "Say that you are a headstrong girl acknowledge your fault and consent to be the wife of a peerSilent again"  "I could wish madam not to make you more angry"  "No indeed there is no occasion for that You have been doing nothing else for many weeks past For my part I cannot conceive what your objection can be Had that desperado been living for whom since his death you have acknowledged what you call your weak prepossession I should have known very well to what cause to attribute your stubbornness but as it is I cannot conceive either your motives or your meaning Nothing however is to be wondered at  in a young lady of your character No prudent person would have dared to indulge a thought in savour of a mad adventurer whose actions were as rash as they were insolent whose family was mean yet had dared to oppose and even make ridiculous attempts to rival that from which you are descended and who yet was himself an outcast of that family"  "It is cruel madam to disturb the ashes of the dead"  This was the first word of retort that had escaped the chidden sufferer and this was uttered in a voice half suffocated with passion  "Cruel indeed Every thing is cruel that contradicts the wishes of young ladies whose melting tenderness is ruinous to themselves and to every body that ought to be most dear to them"  "You must pardon me madam for again and again repeating in my own defence that there is no part of my conduct  which can justify such an accusation"  "How Miss Is an avowed partiality for a fortunehunter no proof Is it no stain on the character of a modern young lady Is it no insult to her family"  "It was a partiality which had never been avowed till death had put an end to hope It was produced and counteracted by very extraordinary circumstances but however strong it might be at some moments which I acknowledge it was for I disdain falsehood it was not indulged I needed no monitor to shew me there were too many reasons why it ought not to be"  "I have not patience A runagate A vagabond A gambler A prizefighter One of the lowest and most contemptible of adventurers who had betrayed his patrons who had flown in the face of his benefactors who was capable  of every kind of malice and mischief and who had not a single virtue"  "Madam I cannot listen to such an assertion as that however I may offend you without continually protesting it is unfounded and that you have been greatly misinformed I scorn to apologise for his mistakes but I know that he had virtues which those who have given you this character of him are never likely to possess How he could be guilty of the crimes of which he has been accused I cannot conceive Even when a boy I have heard him express sentiments which I shall never forget and which have since been confirmed by his actions You were acquainted with none of them You speak from report and from report which I am sure was false and wicked His heart I know to have been compassionate his principles such as no mean mind could have conceived  and his courage blameably great though it saved my life Tears half choaked her utterance But for him I should have been where he now is a different train of events might have taken place and he perhaps might have been living I owe him my life and you must forgive me if I cannot fit patiently and hear his memory traduced without the least occasion for Her sobbing could not be stifled since he is dead you can no longer think him dangerous"  Oh Olivia  Gracious God What were the throbs the thrillings the love the indignation the transports of my soul How did a few moments raise and allay in me the whirlwind of the passions How did my frame tremble and madden and shiver and burn How were my lips at once bursting with frenzy and locked in silence It was my guardian angel that protected me that pleaded for me that awed me  to patience and that repaid by her seraphic praise the virtue she had inspired  Oh yes it was Olivia It was she herself that had the justice the fortitude and the affection to assert the dignity of truth to controvert an overbearing aunt whom she revered for this aunt had her virtues and to speak in defiance of that hypocrisy which inculcates the silence that intends to deceive and which teaches females that sincerity is an unpardonable vice  CHAP XI  FALSE CONCLUSIONS RECTIFIED A LOVER'S REVERIES THE DANGERS OF A STAGECOACH IN A DARK NIGHT AND A FOG THE DISCOVERY OF MORE OLD ACQUAINTANCES AND THE JOURNEY PURSUED  IT has been truly remarked that the most serious and even the most dignified  emotions are sometimes mingled with the most ludicrous When the divine Olivia had ended there was a momentary pause and Clarke meditating no doubt on the advantages of which he had been deprived and to the enjoyment of which every man feels he has a right directing his remark to me suddenly exclaimed"What would I give now if I understood all that these ladies were saying as well as you do"  "Estce donc que Monsieur sçait parler François  What sir Can you speak French" said the aunt with a burst of surprise  "Yes madam" answered I in a low and tremulous voice  "Gesù Maria Chi l' avrebbe pensato Parliamo Italiano Signora  Good God who could have thought it Let us speak Italian Miss" continued she but suddenly recollecting herself added"Perhaps sir you speak that language too"  "Yes madam"  A dead silence ensued which was only once or twice interrupted by an exclamation of discontent from the aunt Each became busied with their own thoughts mine were distracted by doubts and apprehensions concerning the manner in which I ought to act I could come to no determination To be seen by the aunt would not only have wounded her pride and if possible have rendered her more implacably my mortal enemy than she had been but it would have subjected Olivia toward whom my heart was bursting with affection to a series of new assaults and persecutions Nay the sudden sight of me might overpower her and even have dangerous effects Such at least were the whisperings either of my tenderness or my vanity And yet to miss this opportunity to acquaint her with none of those overwhelming sensations that were all thankfulness love and  adoration and not so much as to inform her that I was still living still perhaps capable of all the good that she had ever supposed of me was in every view of it tormenting How had she struggled to conceal her emotions when she mentioned my death and that I had saved her life Should I deserve this tenderness if I could leave her to grieve a moment longer Such unkindness were not only unworthy of me but might be dangerous it might even risk her compliance to the proposed match  And here a torrent of painful anxieties and surmises rushed upon me The hateful subject was brought fully to my recollection Andrews was no longer the rival I had to dread A lord had entered the lists a peer of the realm had sued for Olivia Who could he be Was it likely that she should long withstand the solicitations of her aunt endure her bitter upbraidings and suffer the rude  taunts of her brother while rank and splendor were courting her acceptance while coronets were crouching at her feet and supplicating her compassion Which of our ancient barons could he be How should I learn Was he young handsome courteous engaging Had he the virtues and the high qualities which imagination is so apt to attach to the word noble  Another train of conjecture seized upon my thoughts How did it happen that they should believe me dead Who were the authors of this false report It must surely be intentional deceit perhaps of the aunt perhaps of Hector invented to induce her to comply with their wishes and ally them to the peerage I must not suffer it to continue The aunt appeared to believe it and that Olivia had no doubt of it was certain My fears confirmed me in the suspicion that it was a family artifice  I was at length awakened from these reveries by the aunt who expressed her surprise and impatience at the slow driving of the coachman It seems it had continued for some time though not remarked by me and it was not long before the coach stopped when I perceived that we were in an uncommonly thick fog Olivia was still silent but the aunt was alarmed by the voices of men and as the darkness and mist prevented all danger of my being known I opened the coachdoor and jumped out and Clarke followed my example  I found on enquiry we were passing Cranfordbridge at the beginning of Hounslowheath that a broadwheeled waggon had approached and that the coachman unable to distinguish the road had alighted to lead his horses left we should be overturned He had trusted the reins to the footman who remained on the box  By the caution of the coachman the waggon was safely passed and he thought proper to mount his box again but he durst not venture to drive fast and as I was alarmed for the safety of Olivia I and Clarke continued beside the horses  We had not gone fifty yards before we were again entangled with a timber carriage the driver of which embarrassed by the fog had turned it across the road  The waters which lie in the hollows on the Hounslowside of the bridge had been greatly increased by the late tempests and heavy rains The coach horses began to snort with more vehemence for they had for some time been disturbed with fright and one of them running against the projecting timber plunged and terrified the rest so that the two forehorses quitting the road dashed into the water dragged the coach after  them in despite of the driver and the nearwheels were hurried down the bank  It fortunately happened that the declivity was not steep enough immediately to overturn the coach otherwise Olivia and her aunt would probably have lost their lives  Bewildered by the fog neither I nor Clarke could act with that promptitude which we desired I however got to the horses' heads myself above the knees in water and stopped them just in time I called to Clarke to come to me and as I knew him to be both strong and determined I committed the horses to him and ran to support the carriage left it should overturn  The coachman sensible of his danger took care to alight on the offside The footman did the same and I with an air of authority which the circumstances inspired ordered them to come to me  and support the coach They obeyed I hastened round to the other side opened the door first took out the aunt and then accomplished the wish of my heart I held the lovely Olivia once more in my arms and once more pressed her to my bosom without the least alarm to her delicacy  For how many rapturous moments are lovers indebted to accident Mine indeed would have been a single bliss and therefore unworthy the name had not the tenderness and the truth of Olivia so lately been manifested But this addition made the transport undescribable To be in my arms yet not to know me but to suppose me dead to feel my embrace and to have no suspicion that it was the embrace of love to be once more safe and I myself once more her protector oh Imagination Strong as thou art thy power is insufficient for the repetition of  such a scene for the complete revival of such ecstacy  I was unwilling to part with my precious burthen which I had no longer any pretence to retain "Pray sir put me down" said the angel with a sweet a gentle and a thankful voice " We are very safe now for which both I and my aunt are infinitely indebted to you"  I could make no reply but I pressed her hand with something of that too ardent rashness of which the aunt had accused me  The old lady too did not forget her acknowledgments She had no doubt now that I was a gentleman My behaviour proved it She should be very proud to thank me in a more proper place for my civilities and would endeavour to repay the obligation if I would do her the favour to call in Hertfordstreet  Olivia was not one of those who think  only of themselves "Having been so good sir" said she "as to take us out of danger perhaps you could be serviceable to the poor coachman"  "Let me first see you back to the inn ladies"  "Some accident may happen in the mean time The horses are unruly We will stay here till all is safe"  The advice was just and it came from Olivia I obeyed and hastened to the coachman who was busied in loosing the traces and relieving the horses from the carriage This was presently done and the coach was left till proper aid and more light could be obtained  I then returned to Olivia and when the coachman came up the aunt enquired if their danger had been great  "I don't know madam what you may call great" answered he "but if that gentleman had not stopped the cattle and if the near wheels had gone one yard  nay two feet farther I should have had an overturn and then how either you or I could have got out of that gravel pit is more than I can tell For my own part I know I thank him with all my heart and the other gentleman too for it is not often that your gentlemen are so handy Instead of helping they generally want somebody to help them I hope they'll be civil enough to take a glass with me By G they shall go to the depth of my pocket and welcome"  "If that be the case" replied the aunt "we are all very much obliged to them indeed But I will take care never to travel in a fog again"  Just as this was passing we heard at a distance and as if coming from the inn a shouting of Hollo Hoix Coachee Coach where are you all  "I declare" said the aunt "that is my nephew's voice This is very lucky He will now take us in his phaeton"  "Surely madam" exclaimed I "you would not trust yourself and this young lady in a phaeton such a night as this when you see the most experienced drivers are liable to such accidents"  "If the lady does" continued the coachman as he was going "why I shall suppose she does not value a broken neck of a farthing"  We then proceeded back to the inn and were presently joined by Hector whom the aunt immediately began to rate  While she was thus employed I endeavouring to disguise my voice as I had before done in the few sentences I had uttered and addressing myself to Olivia said "I should be exceedingly concerned madam if I thought you would suffer Mr Mowbray to drive you home till day light shall appear"  "I certainly shall not sir" answered she "But do you know my brother"  "Madam"  "You are acquainted with his name and I don't recollect that it has been mentioned"  I hesitated Hector turned upon us we were approaching the light and with a suddenness which fear and passion inspired knowing that Mowbray did not understand Italian I said in an under voice  "Il' Signor Hugo Trevor non é morto bellissima Signora  Mr Trevor is not dead dearest lady"At the same instant I snatched her hand pressed it was about to raise it to my lips but recollecting myself turned short round and added  "Addio"  Clarke was at my back and I pluckled him by the coat and whispered"Come with me"  But what of Olivia Was she dead to feeling at this strange mysterious moment Did no rushing orrent of ideas suddenly overwhelm her The man  whose loss she had lamented not in his grave that man again her saviour her guardian genius in the dark hour of dread and danger acquainted in a way the most extraordinary with her thoughts and favourable wishes or as she was too severely inclined to term it her passion and its folly a witness that she did not credit all which malice could urge against him nor listen in base silence when her perhaps too partial heart pleaded in his behalf nay more that man the protector of her aunt by whom he had been so often and so bitterly reviled that man travelling in obscurity in familiar society with a carpenter yet braving peril in her behalf and shunning the thanks which the uncommon services he had rendered might boldly make him claim avoiding them most certainly because of the mean condition to which he was reduced faithful in his affection for such his behaviour spoke him but  unfortunate depressed despised sinking under poverty languishing away his youth or crushed by accumulating disastersDid no such fears no such tender recollections assail her bosom I have described her ill indeed if that could be supposed I must pursue my narrative for how can I picture what most indubitably must have passed in her heart since I feel myself so very incapable of delineating my own  This adventure did not entirely end here I wished to have gone forward on foot to Hounslow without delay but Clarke interceded for a glass of brandy He said the water had chilled him and he was still more importunate with me to take the same preventative I had no fear for myself for I had no such feeling but as I did not think I had any right to trifle with his health I returned with him taking the precaution to go through the passage to the kitchen door  Here just as we came to the threshold who should be coming in face of us carrying a pair of candles but my quondam servant Philip  The instant he beheld me he turned pale trembled set down the lights stood aghast for a moment and then took to his heels  Though not so terrified I was almost as much surprised as he and suffered him to escape before I had the presence of mind to know how to act As however it was my plan to avoid being known myself for the present I thought proper to make no other enquiry than to ask whose servant he was and was answered that he came with the ladies who had just returned from the coach  Various conjectures instantly crossed my imagination all of which were associated with the sudden flight from Bath the robbery he had committed the seeming honesty and even affection of his  character previous to that event his now being in the service of Olivia for I understood him to be her own valet and the story of my death But though my curiosity was greatly excited the present was not the time in which these mysteries could be unravelled We therefore took Clarke's prescription against cold and leaving Cranford bridge pursued our road to Hounslow where we arrived about eleven o'clock and put up at an inferior inn left any accident should bring us again in company with the aunt and the nephew  CHAP XII  MEDITATIONS ON WHAT HAD PASSED THE CONDOLENCE OF CLARKE ARRIVAL AT LONDON THE MEETING OF FORMER FRIENDS LAW ARRANGEMENTS  IT may be well supposed that the incidents of this night were not easily driven from my imagination While we were walking the care we were obliged to take and the gloom around us prevented any thing from escaping me sufficiently marked to attract the notice of my companion But when we were seated in a room with lights and my mind was no longer diverted by other objects the reveries into which I fell the interjections that broke from me the hasty and interrupted manner in which I ate and drank the expressions of extreme joy which altered my countenance at one moment and the solemn seriousness  which it assumed the next with my eyes fixed while the tears rolled down my cheeks at last so agitated poor Clarke that he exclaimed"For God's sake Mr Trevor what is the matter with you"  My silence for I was unable to speak did but increase his alarm"Are you taken ill What has befallen you Won't you open your mind to me If I could do you any good I hope you don't think I should be backward Are you unhappy"  "No no"  "I am very glad of that But something uncommon I am sure has happened to you though it may not be fit perhaps that I should hear what And I don't want to be a busy body though I must say I should be more at ease if I was quite sure that all was right That's all I have no other curiosity"  "All is not right but yet I hope it will  be I know not by what means It seems indeed impossible And perhaps it is and yet I hope I hope I hope"  "Well well I am glad of that We should all hope We are bid to hope God help us if we did not Perhaps I can't give you any help I suppose that is beyond me I am sorry for it But what can a poor carpenter do in the way of befriending a gentleman"  "A poor carpenter can have a kind heart and I do not know whether that is not the most blessed thing on earth Did you ever hear me repeat the name of Olivia"  "Yes when you were lightheaded I heard the name many a time and often And the nurse said you raved of nobody else But we could none of us find out who she was Though I must say I have often enough wished to ask but that I did not think it became me to seem to be at all prying"  "That is the lady you have been in company with tonight It is she whom you have helped me to save I was sufficiently indebted to you before but what am I then at present"  "Well that to be sure is accidental enough I could not have thought it How oddly things do fall out But I am glad of it with all my heart  "I could not see much of her to be sure though I looked with all the eyes I had but I thought somehow she seemed as fine a young creature as I had ever beheld since the hour I was born which the mildness of her voice did but make the more likely I thought to myself I never in my days heard any living soul so sweetspoken So that I must say things have fallen out very strangely  "I always said to my Sally there must be something between you and the gentlewoman the name of  which  was on your tongue's end so often while you  were down in the fever and I am glad to the heart that you have happened on her again so unexpectedly though I can see no good reason now you have found her why you should be in such a hurry to get away"  The unaffected participation of Clarke in all my joys and sorrows the questions which his feelings impelled him to put and the fidelity of his nature as well as the impulse which passion gave me to disburthen my mind were all of them inducements to speak and I informed him of many of those particulars which have already been recited  The more intimately he became acquainted with my history the more powerfully he seemed imbued with my hopes and fears and the better satisfied I was with the confidence I had reposed in him I am unable to paint the honest indignation of his feelings and phraseology at the injustice which he as well as  I supposed had been done me the depression of his countenance when I dwelt on the despair and wretchedness which the almost impossibility of my obtaining Olivia inspired and the animation with which he seemed as it were to set his shoulders to the wheel when my returning fervor led me to the opposite extreme and gave me confidence in my own powers and the strenuous exertions on which I was resolved  The conversation continued long after we retired to rest so that our sleep was short for we were up again very early before it was light and continued our journey to London where we arrived a little after nine in the morning  I immediately proceeded to the lodging of Miss Wilmot whom I found where I had left her and who was truly rejoiced to see me Clarke had never been in London I therefore took him  with me gave a proper account of him to Miss Wilmot and we all breakfasted together while Mary waited whose features as well as her words sufficiently testified the unexpected pleasure of the meeting and who artlessly related the apprehensions of herself and my few friends at not hearing from me  My first enquiries were concerning Wilmot and Turl and I was delighted to learn that Wilmot whom I left in a sickly state of mind that was seriously alarming had been awakened by Turl to a more just sense of human affairs and had recovered much of the former vigour and elasticity of his talents  His sister told me that he was at present engaged in a periodical publication and had beside composed a considerable part of a comedy of which Turl as well as herself conceived the greatest hopes  The reader scarcely need be told that this intelligence gave me great pleasure  It led me to revolve mighty matters in my own mind created emulation and inspired me with increasing confidence and alacrity Yes said I exultingly genius may safely encounter and dare difficulties Let it but confide in itself and it will conquer them all  While we were conversing Wilmot came in  I must leave the imagination to paint the welcome we gave each other  I was surprised at the change which had taken place in his form and physiognomy and at the different aspect they had assumed Not that the marks of melancholy were quite eradicated but when I considered his whole appearance he was scarcely the same person  I produced surprise in him of a contrary kind There was neither the wonted freshness of my complexion nor the fashionable ease of my air and dress which he had remarked but a few months  before and he took the first private opportunity that offered to enquire with great earnestness if there were any means by which he could be of service  Under the general selfishness which our present institutions inspire such questions are wonderfully endearing I answered him that I had found a friend whose principles were as liberal and enlarged as they were uncommon and that I would take an early occasion to give him an account of my present designs and the posture of my affairs  He informed me that the severe application of Turl had enfeebled his health and had induced him to reside for a few weeks at a small place by the seaside that he might enjoy the benefits of bathing and the fresh breezes for which purpose he had left London the week before that neither Wilmot nor Turl himself considered his case at present as the least dangerous but that they had  both agreed this was a prudent step and that he had received a letter from Turl informing him of his safe arrival and that he thought he had already derived benefit and animation from the journey  Turl was not a man to be known and to be thought of with apathy The intelligence Wilmot gave me softened as it was by the circumstances attending it produced a very unpleasant feeling The possibility of the loss of such a man so wise so benevolent and so undaunted in the cause of truth was a sensation for which I have no epithet Wilmot perceived what passed in my mind and again assured me of his thorough persuasion that there was not any danger  We passed as much of the morning together as Wilmot could spare from his occupations after which we parted and each proceeded on his own concerns I to enquire after a dwellingplace and  be to his literary engagements while Clarke instructed by Mary went in search of a lodging for himself through those streets that were most likely to afford him one at a reasonable rate  Mr Evelyn had a relation of a younger branch of the family in the law whose name was Hilary to whom I was recommended and from whom I received the utmost attention in consequence of the letters I brought This gentleman was an attorney of repute a practitioner of uncommon honesty assiduous and capable as a professional man a firm defender of freedom even to his own risk and detriment a sincere speaker a valuable friend and in every sense a man of worth and principle  Happy at all times to oblige he willingly undertook the task assigned to him by Mr Evelyn's recommendation and in pursuance of his advice I hired an apartment in the neighbourhood of  Queen'ssquare Bloomsbury that I might be within a convenient distance of the inns of Court yet not entirely buried in the noise and smoke of the disagreeable part of the town  I likewise informed Mr Hilary of my determination not to be a dumb barrister and having from my appearance and mode of enunciation as well as from the letters of Mr Evelyn conceived rather a high opinion of my talents he applauded my plan in pursuance of which he recommended me to place myself with Counsellor Ventilate a man of high situation in the law I readily consented and it was agreed that he should speak to that gentleman immediately on the subject and appoint a meeting  CHAP XIII  MORE MEDITATIONS RELATING TO OLIVIA CONCLUDING WITH A LOVELETTER DOUBTS CONCERNING ITS CONVEYANCE  IT cannot be supposed that Olivia was out of my thoughts Knowing her kindness toward Miss Wilmot I carefully took the first opportunity to inform the latter of the chief incidents that had passed and to concert with her some means if possible of obtaining an interview  Miss Wilmot no longer received any pecuniary aid from Olivia Wilmot considered it as a duty to provide for his sister and had too lofty a sense of independance to admit the repetition of these favours Yet how far that pride of heart which teaches us not only that we should not submit to receive pecuniary assistance from any human being except from our relations but that these relations can accept of no relief however much they  may be in need of it without tarnishing our honor is a question which deserves to be seriously examined Not but at that time it squared very aptly with my opinions It may be further remarked of relations that as they sometimes think they ought only to receive aid from each other so they most of them imagine that from each other they may unblushingly extort all they can The generous Wilmot indeed was in no danger of this last mistake  But though money was no longer a motive for intercourse between the gentle Olivia and Miss Wilmot there was no danger that either of the friends would forget the other and the latter was too sincerely interested in the happiness both of me and Olivia not to be willing to promote that happiness by every means in her power  What these means should be was the difficulty we had to solve To use any  kind of stratagem would offend the delicate and justlyfeeling Olivia To come upon her by surprise even if the opportunity should offer itself would not be a manly and dignified proceeding  I had always thought highly of that courage which mild as her manners were she never failed to exert on trying occasions Her defence of me in the coach was a proof that I had not overestimated her fortitude It likewise shewed that she was under mistakes concerning me that were dangerous should they remain unexplained and that whenever I thought of them which was but too often excited my utmost indignation  Bold however as she was in my defence when she supposed me dead very different sensations might assail her when she should be convinced if she still doubted that I was living Her submission to her aunt seemed to be unlimited as long as she supposed that to comply would be  less productive of harm than to resist but I had witnessed that she would not consent to actions of great moment which her heart disapproved  These facts made it improbable that she would grant me an interview without her aunt's knowledge What then was to be done A letter that should fully explain my thoughts my plans my determination and my hopes and fears appeared to be the most eligible mode Were I to prompt her to a clandestine correspondence I was well aware that I should highly and justly offend her She would consider it as little less than an insult Her conduct was open her mind superior to deceit and to be ignorant of this would be to shew myself unworthy of her The lover should disdain to excite his mistress to any action which he would disapprove in a wife and this was a rule not to be infringed by him who should aspire to the nobleminded Olivia  To write then I resolved and in such a manner as to open my whole soul to her awaken her affections call forth her admiration agitate her with pity and love and ensure her perseverance  Alas I took the pen in hand but was miserably deceived I had undertaken an impossible task Thought was too rapid too multifarious too complicate and the tracing of letters and words infinitely too slow and frigid At last however after repeated attempts I determined on sending the following with which when written I was very far from satisfied but of that I despaired  "To the woman whom my soul adores how shall I address myself Tumultuous thoughts hopes that vanish and fears that distract are ill fitted for such a task Governed by feelings which will admit of no controul I can only claim your pardon on the plea of inability to preserve that silence which it is temerity or  something worse to break My thoughts will have passage will rush into your presence will expose themselves to the worst of calamities your reproof and anger Distracted as I am by a dread of the dangers that may result from my silence I persuade myself that these dangers are more immediate and threatening though scarcely more painful than your disapprobation  "You have supposed me dead though by what strange accident I cannot divine Under that supposition it was my miraculous fortune my ecstatic bliss to hear you with a purity of heart and a dignity of sentiment such as none but a heart like yours could conceive or express avow a former partiality in favour of one who whatever may be his other faults would gladly resign his life to secure your happiness of one who in his overweening affection has fondly and foolishly  cherished the persuasion that this happiness is inseparable from his own nay who partly hopes and partly believes so blind is his egotism that he is the only man on earth who fully comprehends your wonderful worth and matchless virtues and who is pursuing the fixed purpose of his soul that of finally deserving you from the conviction that he through life will be invariable in that admiration that tenderness and that unceasing love without which the life of Olivia might perhaps be miserable These may be the dreams of vanity and folly yet if I do not mistake they are the dreams of all lovers They are indeed the aliment or rather the very essence of love What delight can equal that of revelling in imagination on the happiness we can bestow on those who have bliss so ineffable to bestow upon us  "What then if I were to see this Olivia  mated with a man so dull of faculty as soon to lose all sense of the wondrous treasure in his possession who never perhaps had any discriminating knowledge of its worth and who shall be willing to barter it for any vile and contemptible gewgaw that may allure his depraved taste or sickly appetite Is there no such man Are these fears wholly groundless  "At what an immeasurable distance do I seem cast from the enjoyment of that supreme bliss to which perhaps the frenzy only of imagination could make me aspire There is but one means by which I can be happy Either I am to be the most favoured of mankind or I am nothing Either I rise into godlike existence or I sink unknown and never to be remembered Either we are made for each other or I dare not think on the reverse It is too distracting  "Yet I have no hope What I now  write is presumption is madness And why It is not your beauty your virtues or the supreme qualities of your mind that would raise this gulph of misery between us No Avarice vanity and prejudice are my enemies It is they that would sacrifice you at their altars That you will persevere in your refusal is my only hope  "How shall I palliate what I cannot defend my behaviour while I overheard you and your aunt In vain do I plead that I was asleep when you came into the coach and that I first discovered you by the sound of your voice and the turn of the conversation that I dreaded exciting any sudden alarm in you perhaps it was a vain dread and that when I ought most to have spoken when I became the subject of the discourse I was then chained in silence by unconquerable emotions Yet to be a listener Indeed indeed it is a thing that my soul disdains  But I have done many such things not knowing while they passed what it was that I did  "My destiny now is to study the law and to this my days and nights shall be devoted but the distance at which I see myself from the goal is a thought which I am obliged by every possible effort to shut out of my memory  "I am in want of consolation but since your society is denied me I know not where it may be found I own there are moments in which I am fearfully agitated Yet I do not solicit an answer Let me rather perish than prompt you to an action of the propriety of which even I am obliged to doubt since it cannot I suppose be done without concealment Oh that you knew every thought of my heart You would then perceive the burning desire I have to make myself every way worthy of that unutterable bliss to which I aspire  "Madman I aspire  "With what contempt would such during be treated by those whom custom and ties of blood have taught you to revere I confess this is a thought which I cannot endure Yet I can less endure to relinquish my impossible hopes Could you conceive what these contradictory and tormenting sensations are you would perhaps be induced to pardon some of the extravagant acts which I heard you so mildly yet so justly censure  "To be yours then is the end for which I live and yet my pride and every other feeling revolts to think I should entreat you to accept a pauper either in wealth or principle Well then I will not waste my time in complaint Let me become worthy of you or let me perish Fool That is impossible But if full I must I will endeavour to make my ruin respectable  "Suffer me to inform you that I have  lately acquired a friend whose virtues are beyond my praise and who has urged me to accept his aid in forwarding my studies and pursuits as an act of duty incumbent on us both Our acquaintance has been short and so considering the serious nature of the subject was the debate that led to this conclusion yet his arguments seemed unanswerable and I hope I have not yielded too lightly Oh that it was allowed me to consult your exquisite sense of right and wrong But wishes are vain  "Thus far I have intruded yet know not how to end My only hope that you will take no offence at what I have written is in the conscious respect that my heart feels for you which I think cannot have misguided my pen and the knowledge that you are too just lightly to attribute mean or ill motives to me  "How languid is all that I have written Am I so impotent that I can present  none of the images that so eternally haunt me that wing me into your presence furnish me with innumerable arguments which seem so allpersuasive melt me in tenderness at one moment supply me with the most irresistible elocution the next and convince you while they inspire me with raptures inexpressible Are they all flown all faded all extinct Where is the fervor that devours me  "I would pray for your happiness I would supplicate heaven that no moment of your bliss should be abridged Shall it then be disturbed by me Oh no Unless authorised by hopes as different as they are wild and improbable pardon but this and you shall never more be subject to the like importunity from  HUGH TREVOR"  Having written my letter I had to devise the means of having it delivered  If it were addressed directly to her what certainty had I that it would not be opened by the aunt Nay was not that indeed the most probable And would it in that case ever be seen by Olivia In my apprehension certainly not  I had then to chuse whether I would send a messenger who should wait about the house and take some opportunity to deliver it clandestinely or commit it to the care either of Mary or Miss Wilmot  The messenger was a very objectionable expedient it was mean and liable to detection The medium of Mary was something of the same kind and the friendship and intelligence of Miss Wilmot rendered her intervention much the most desirable  It was a delicate office to require of her But she could speak the truth she could say that it was to relate some facts which Olivia might even desire to  know that it contained nothing which I myself should wish her to conceal if she thought fit to shew it that it did not invite her to any improper correspondence and that it was the only one which under the present circumstances I meant to obtrude upon her  That Miss Wilmot might be convinced I had neither deceived myself nor her in this account which I should instruct her to give of it I hastened with it to her lodgings and requested her to read it before it was sealed Having ended she was so well satisfied with the propriety both of writing and delivering it that she readily undertook the latter office and with her I left it hoping that Olivia would soon call would read it in her presence and that I should quickly learn what might be the sensations it should produce  CHAP XIV  COUNSELLOR VENTILATE AND THE LAW RAPTURES EXCITED BY THE PANEGYRIC OF BLACKSTONE DIALOGUES LEGAL AND POLITICAL WITH CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS  MEANTIME the appointed interview between me and Counsellor Ventilate took place This gentleman was characterized by those manners and opinions which the profession of the law is so eminently calculated to produce He had a broad brazen stare a curl of contempt on his upperlip and a somewhat short supercilious nose His head was habitually turned upward his eye in the contrary direction as if on the watch in expectation to detect something which his cunning might turn to advantage and his halfopened mouth and dropping jaw seemed to say "What an immense fool is every man I meet"  His whole manner and aspect appeared to denote that he was in a continual revery and that he imagined himself in a court of law browbeating a witness interrogating an idiot or detailing cases and precedents to shew the subtlety with which he could mislead and confound his hearers A splithair distinction without a difference gave him rapture and whenever it happened to puzzle which was but too often he raised his left shoulder and gave a hem of congratulation to himself denoting his conviction that he was indisputably the greatest lawyer in the world And if the greatest lawyer he was as certainly according to his own creed the greatest man For the rest of mankind if put in competition with lawyers what were they What but poor silly imbecile creatures  One standard by which he delighted to measure his own talents was the length to which he could drawl out a reply  Was there a man to be found who could speak eight hours unceasingly He would surpass him When his turn came nine should not suffice He would be more dull contradictory and intolerable than his rival by an hour at least He would repeat precedents twist sentences misconstrue maxims and so perplex and entangle his own intellect that his hearers had no way of getting rid of the pain he excited except by falling asleep or determining not to listen It must be owned however he had some charity for them for to sleep he gave them a very sufficient provocative  Being one of the retainers of government he had a seat in the House of Commons where he used to rise in his place and address the Speaker with no less logic love of justice and legislative wisdom than he was wont to display when pleading in the courts  It was in vain that he exposed himself to the ridicule of this most discerning body not less witty than virtuous Of shame he was incapable He would again and again rise in his place totally forgetful of past flagellation and again and again convince Mr Speaker and the honorable members persisting to labour in the hope of making them all as profound reasoners as himself No matter that the thing was impracticable he would get up and do his duty and sit down and receive his own applause  To mention shame in this case was indeed absurd How should a man blush at reproof which he cannot comprehend His skull was so admirably fortified by nature that it was equally impenetrable to the heavy batteries of argument or the skirmishing artillery of wit Let the cannon roar he heard it not He was abstractedly contemplating those obscure  depths in which he remained for ever seated and where he had visions innumerable though he saw nothing  One favourite and neverfailing object on these occasions was to instruct the house in law And here the devil who is himself a kind of lawyer for he devours his best friends the devil I say chose these opportunities to vent his choicest malice He did not set a lawyer to confound a lawyer that were but a stale device He humbled him out of the mouths of men who had occasionally read lawbooks it is true but who had read them without a lawyer's obliquity and had enquired what was the simple unadulterated intention of their authors Now law which in all its stages has a quibble in either eye that may mean good or may mean ill is every where except in a Court of Justice capable of a good interpretation This is not a rule without an exception but in many cases at least  law has something intentionally beneficial in its principle  For this beneficent vitalspark every body but a lawyer is in search and it is what every body but a lawyer is delighted to find No wonder therefore that a lawyer should meet discomfiture and confusion when he pretends to discuss the abstract nature of justice in any place except in these aforesaid Courts of Justice  Thus it happened that Mr Ventilate was on all such occasions confounded in that honorable house of which he was an honorable member which indeed when we remember who were his opponents was less miraculous than the immaculate conceptionPshaw I mean the transmigrationsof Vishnoo  Much of the conceit and ridicule of the character of Mr Ventilate was apparent even to my eye at our first meeting But he was a person of great practice and had the reputation of a sound  lawyer which signifies a man who has patience to read reports and a facility at quoting them Beside I was in hastle and rather inclined to leap over an obstacle than to go round it  Accordingly our arrangements were made and the next day I attended at his chambers with a firm and as I supposed not to be shaken determination to become one of the greatest lawyers the world ever beheld  The first book I was advised to read as a historical introduction to and compendium of law was Blackstone's Commentaries This author had acquired too much celebrity for any man of liberal education to be ignorant of his fame I therefore began and continued to read him with all the prepossession that an author himself could wish in his favour The panegyric he makes on English laws and the Constitution of Britain gave me delight and animation The reproof he  bestows on gentlemen who are ignorant of this branch of learning and on the perplexities introduced into our statutelaw by such "illjudging and unlearned legislators" and his praise of the capacity they would acquire for administering justice to which sacred function they are so often called were this ignorance removed gave dignity to the study I was about to pursue  Then the account given of Servius Sulpicius who according to my learned author "left behind him about a hundred and fourscore volumes of his own compiling" How wonderfully did it move my admiration I previously knew that in most countries which are denominated civilized law was voluminous but I had never till then imagined that one man could himself compile a hundred and fourscore volumes And as it seems could compile them at his leisure too for his chief business was that of  oratory Beside which it lives on record that being a firm patriot he was a wise and indefatigable senator But it appears that Sulpicius could devour law with greater case than Milo or perhaps even than Cacus himself could oxen  Neither was it recorded that this prodigy of legal learning began young And should I then despair of equalling him No no get me into one of my trances and had he compiled as many thousands of volumes I should scarcely have suspected that I could not compile as fast as he  As I read on how did I deplore the quarrel between Vicarius and his opponents or in other words between the pandects and the common law of England with the ignorance that had nearly been the result How rejoice in the institution of those renowned hotbeds of law the Inns of Court by the aid of which had not the rage for enacting laws kept  pace with the rage for studying them there were hopes that the whole kingdom would in time have been so learned in the science that every man might indeed have become his own lawyer  How did I regret that I had not studied commonlaw while at college How sympathise with my author when he exclaims"That a science which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong which teaches to establish the one and prevent punish or redress the other which employs in its theory the noblest faculties of the soul and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart a science which is universal in its use and extent accommodated to each individual yet comprehending the whole community that a science like this should ever have been deemed unnecessary to be studied in a university is a matter of astonishment and concern"  How did I bless the memory of Mr  Viner who had found a remedy for this evil by establishing an Oxford professorship and how promise to make myself master of his abridgment till I had every case it contained at my tongue's end What were four and twenty volumes in folio Compared to Sulpicius it was a trifle  The eulogium that I next came to on a university education how grateful was that to my heart I was not as my oracle described though one of the "gentlemen of bright imaginations to be wearied however unpromising the search" Neither was I to be numbered among those "many persons of moderate capacity who confuse themselves at first setting out and continue ever dark and puzzled during the remainder of their lives" The law being itself so luminous there was no fear of that with me  I met indeed with one overwhelming assertion "Such knowledge as is necessary  for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of twenty years"  But this to be sure must be meant of dull fellows As to the limits of genius they were unknown  My pleasure revived in full force when I arrived at my author's definition of law which he states to be"a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong" What will you say to that friend Turl exclaimed I putting down the book and pausing Can any thing be more provident more wise more desirable  In short I found the writer so clearly understood and satisfactorily explained the nature of law and the benefits arising from it that for my own part I began to be ashamed of my former stupidity It was all so selfevident that it seemed disgraceful not to know it as it were by intuition I was in that precise temper  of mind which renders conviction an easy task for I was in haste to be rich and famous and the desire of wealth and fame are two of the strongest provocatives to faith that the sagacity of selfishness has ever yet discovered  While I was in the midst of all these admirings my attention was roused by a dialogue that passed between two of my senior fellowpupils whose names were Rudge and Trottman which the former thus began  "That was a d rascally cause we were concerned in yesterday"  "Rascally enough But we got it"  "I can't say but I was sorry for the poor farmer"  "Sorry Ha ha ha You remind me of an unfleshedrecruit or a young surgeon who has just begun to walk the hospitals Frequent the Courts and you will soon learn to forget commiseration and attend to nothing but law Docking of entails gives the lawyer as little concern  as the amputation of limbs does the surgeon they are both of them curious only about the manner and dexterity of the operation"  "I suppose it will ruin the man"  "He was a fool for making it a criminal prosecution He should have brought an action for damages"  "It is an aggravating thing for a man to have his daughter seduced be beaten himself because he was angry at the injury and when he sues for redress not only be unable to obtain it but find his fortune destroyed as well as his daughter's character and his own peace"  "The law knows nothing concerning him or his fortune character peace or daughter It is and ought to be dead to private feeling It must consider nothing but the public benefit nor must it ever condescend to vary from its own plain and literal construction"  "That is strange for its origin seems  to have been in those very feelings to which it is so dead"  "Undoubtedly But it provides for such feelings each under its individual class and if a man seeking redress shall seek it under a wrong head that is his fault and not the fault of the law"  "It is a fault however that is daily committed"  "Ay to be sure or there would be but few lawyers"  "How so"  "Why if a man doing wrong was certain or almost certain of being detected and exposed the chances would be so much against offenders that offences would of course diminish"  "Then the prosperity of lawyers seems to result from the blunders which they themselves commit"  "No doubt it does and as the blunders are innumerable their prosperity must be in proportion"  "There seems to be something wrong in this though I cannot tell what or why"  "Ha ha ha You have no cause to complain you are a lawyer and your own interest must teach you that every thing is right Except indeed that the classes or heads I mentioned and consequently the blunders are not numerous enough But thank heaven we have a remedy for that for our statutebooks are daily swelling"  "Why yes Some people say they are pregnant with mischief of which it is further asserted that they are daily delivered"  "Ay certainly and to the great joy of the parents"  "Who are they"  "Enquire for the father at St Stephen's and for the mother at Westminsterhall I assure you they are both enraptured at their own offspring The  old lady sits in state and daily praises her babes with the most doating loquacity And she does this with so grave a face that it is impossible to forbear laughing when you hear her She is so serious so solemn so convinced that every thing she utters is oracular and so irascible if she does but so much as smell a doubt concerning the beauty and perfection of her brats that there is no scene in the world which tickles my imagination so irresistibly as to watch her maternal visage during her eulogiums while the bigwigs are nodding approbation or the contortions of her physiognomy when any cross incident happens to impede the torrent of her fondness With all due respect to her motherly functions she is a very freakish and laughable old lady"  "You have a turn for ridicule but I confess if I thought your picture were true I do not believe my sensations  would be so pleasant as yours appear to be"  "And why in the name of common sense"  "How can one laugh at the mistakes and miseries of mankind"  "For a very simple reason because it is the only way that can render them endurable None but a fool would cry at what cannot be corrected"  The colloquy between my companions here took another direction less interesting to me and left me to pause and ruminate This picture said I is satirical I own but surely it is unjust Blackstone beyond all doubt understood the science profoundly and his account of it is very different indeed  I turned back to the passage I have quoted  "It distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong teaches us to establish the  one and prevent punish or redress the other employs in its theory the noblest faculties of the soul and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart it is universal in its use and extent is accommodated to each individual and yet comprehends the whole community"  How just how ennobling how sublime is this praise To compare it to the doatings of an old woman is extremely false nay is pernicious for by exciting laughter it misleads the judgment  My companions being silent I was impelled to address myself to Trottman "I wonder sir" said I "that you should be such an enemy to law"  "I an enemy You totally mistake I am its fast friend And with good reason I find it a very certain source of ease and affluence even to the most stupid blockheads if they will but drudge on and of riches honours and hereditary  fame to men of but very moderate talents I may surely expect to come in for my share and therefore should be a rank fool indeed were I its enemy I leave that to innovating fanatics Let them dream and rave and write while I mind my own affairs take men as they are and ever must be profit by supporting present establishments and look down with contempt on the puppies who prate philosophy and bawl for reform"  I was stung Conscious of the turn my own thoughts had taken I suspected that he had divined this from some words which I might have dropped and that his attack was personal I therefore eagerly replied"Your language sir is unqualified"  "I meant no offence If you are a reformer I beg your pardon I never quarrel about what I have heard certain pompous gentlemen call principles"  "Then all those persons who differ in opinion from you are puppies and pompous gentlemen"  "Oh dear no sir Only all those that are absent The company you know according to the received rule is excepted"  There was something impudently humble and satirical in his look while he uttered this yet so contrived as to make the man appear a pettish angry blockhead who should take offence at it and I certainly was not inclined to quarrel with my new comrades the first day of our acquaintance  Beside Trottman was a little insignificant man in appearance potbellied of a swarthy complexion but with keenness cunning and mockery in his eye and whose form and figure as well as his turn of mind must have made it ridiculous to have quarrelled with him I  therefore waited for some more fortunate opportunity to repay him in his own coin for I was as unwilling to be vanquished by wit and satire as by force of argument or of arms  Rudge whose temper was more placid but who had an enquiring mind said "You do not know my friend Trottman yet Mr Trevor He cares but little who has the most reason so that he may have the most laughter"  "Life is a journey" added Trottman "and if I can travel on terra firma with a clear sky and a smiling landscape let those that please put to sea in a butcher's tray and sail in quest of foul weather"  "Yes sir but the search of ease is the loss of happiness and to fly from danger is the likeliest way to meet it that is when you either seek or fly without a guide"  "And who is this guide to safety"  "It is what you appear to hold in contempt Principle"  "Ha ha ha Right The blind leading the blind Conjure up one phantom to seek for another How prodigiously we improve"  "From what you have said I am not surprised that you should consider principle as a phantom But you only quarrel with the word for as principle can mean nothing more than a rule of action deduced from past experience and influencing our present conduct you certainly like other men act from principle It is a moral duty to shun pain and keep your fingers out of the fire"  "Not if I want to sear up a wound"  "You are excellent at a shifting blow But why would you apply the cautery Because principle guided by experience has previously told you that to cauterize is in some cases the way to heal"  "But empirics who cauterize without  healing are daily multiplying upon us"  "Were that granted it is but empiric opposed to empiric Men have been groaning under their sufferings for ages and since ages have proved that the old prescriptions were insufficient I can neither see the danger nor the blame of following new"  "Zeal may be purblind and perhaps could not see a guillotine but her neck might chance to feel it"  "Then you think a guillotine a more terrible thing than a halter an axe or perhaps even a rack"  "It will do more work in less time"  "And you suppose it to be principle or if you please innovation that has given this machine its momentum"  "Suppose Is there any doubt"  "Infinite I imagine it to be given if we may be allowed to personify neither by Innovation nor Establishment  but by the rashness and ill temper with which these heroines have mutually maintained their positions Innovation struck the ball at first too impetuously but Establishment took it at the rebound and returned it with triple violence Brunswickian manifestoes and exterminating wars were not ill adapted to raise the diabolical spirit of revenge An endeavour to starve a nation which it was found difficult to exterminate by fire and sword was not a very charitable act in Madam Establishment Her swindling forgeries were little better and that her turn should come to be starved and swindled is not miraculous though it is deplorable Heaven avert her claims to the guillotine"  My antagonist had no immediate reply and Rudge exclaimed with some satisfaction "Why Trottman you have met with your match"  "Not I indeed" answered he peevishly  "I am only lost in a labyrinth of words and am waiting for Principle to come and be my guide But I am afraid she carries a dark lanthorn which will but blind those that look"  "I suspect sir" said I "you are less at loss for a joke than an argument and that you prefer bushfighting For my own part I love the fair and open field of enquiry"  "As this is a field that has no limits nor any end to its cross roads I am content as you say to sit down under my hedge and be quiet"  "No no I did not say that for I see you love to draw a sly bow at passengers"  "I have now and then brought down a gull or an owl"  "Have you shot any of those birds today"  I felt no compunction in making this triumphant retort to his sneer And here our dialogue ended Though it  was a kind of declaration of war I mean a war of words which as we became more acquainted was occasionally waged with some asperity  But in one respect Trottman was my superior To sneer was habitual to him but it was always done in a manner which seemed to indicate that he himself had no suspicion of any such intent So that he continually appeared to keep his temper and never triumphed so effectually as when he could provoke me to lose mine On which occasions his additional conciliatory sarcasms accompanied with smiles denoting the enjoyment of his victory never failed to make me feel my own littleness And this is a lesson for which I consider myself as very highly in his debt  I now pursued my reading and employed the rest of the day in beginning to copy the manuscript precedents that were to capacitate me for the practice of  law for the number of which that were in his possession Mr Ventilate was famed  My ardour however had felt some trifling abatement by the very different picture and panegyric of the law as given by Trottman opposed to that I had been contemplating But I had this very powerful consolation that as Trottman knew very little of what I supposed to be the true principles of politics it was highly probable he was no better acquainted with those of law  CHAP XV  FORMER RESENTMENTS REVISED DOUBTS PROTRACTED CONJECTURES ON THE SINCERITY OF A DELICATE YET FIRM MIND  ABOVE a fortnight passed away during which I received no word of intelligence concerning Olivia At some moments I  felt great affliction from this suspense at others I collected myself and determined to pursue my plan with all the vigour in which it had been conceived  In the interval I wrote several times to Mr Evelyn To this I was prompted from the very nature of my engagements and situation Beside which I had not forgotten my pamphlet against the Earl and the Bishop that lay ready for publication though the acrimony of my feelings was much abated The propriety of making the world acquainted with this affair was one of the subjects of my correspondence with Mr Evelyn to whom I had the candour to state my own opinions and sensations on one part and on the other the objections that had been urged by Turl  In the history I had given Mr Evelyn of myself I was impelled as well by inclination as necessity to delineate the character of Turl with which he  could not but be charmed and with his arguments and dissuasions on this subject With these the ideas of Mr Evelyn entirely coincided He wrote delightful letters full of animation feeling and friendship and his persuasion therefore had the greater effect  Wilmot concurred in the opinion of both and being thus pressed by the men whom I most loved and revered I endeavoured to consign my resentment and its effusions to oblivion and to dismiss the subject entirely from my mind  At length my suspense concerning Olivia found some though far from a satisfactory relief  As she had paid no visit to Miss Wilmot the latter of course had found no opportunity to deliver my letter One evening however as I was sitting after tea with Miss Wilmot and her brother a note came of which the following were the contents  "Miss Mowbray presents her kind and tenderest respects to Miss Wilmot and informs her that she has been in town for some short time Assures her that her not having called is far indeed from any decline of former friendship the sincerity of which is invariable but that there are motives which prevent her for the present from the enjoyment of that satisfaction She would have been most happy to have communicated her thoughts to Miss Wilmot in person but she is the slave of circumstances which for family reasons and indeed from other motives she is forbidden to explain and to which she is obliged to submit She confides in the goodness and friendship of Miss Wilmot who she is well assured will not misinterpret that which is unavoidable and cherishing the hope of a more favourable opportunity wishes her all possible happiness requesting that if by any means in her power it can be increased  Miss Wilmot will acquaint her with those means that she may have the wishedfor occasion of proving the ardour and sincerity of her affections"  "Hertfordstreet Nov th"  Miss Wilmot gave me this note to read and the commentary I immediately made was that finding I was alive the fear of a rencontre with me was the obstacle to her visits  They agreed that this was a very probable supposition but how far the aunt was any way concerned in it was matter of more uncertain conjecture Miss Wilmot knew that Olivia had informed her aunt of the visits she was before accustomed to make and as her ideas concerning sincerity were delicately strict it was more than probable that she had disdained to conceal any of the circumstances with which she herself was acquainted I therefore thought it almost  indubitable that she had been no less frank on the present occasion than was habitual to her on others and time afterward discovered that my conclusions were right  "With what unequal weapons" exclaimed I "do the lovers of truth and the adherents of hypocrisy contend"  "They do indeed" replied Wilmot  "But contrary I believe to your supposition the former have infinitely the advantage for the latter systematically deceive themselves"  What was to be done Was I to pursue some covert mode of conveying my letter Should I send it openly Or ought I to let it remain and patiently wait the course of events which by endeavouring to forward I might but retard Wilmot who though he had too much sympathy to communicate all his fears had but little expectation judging from the failure of his own plans  of the success of mine advised me to the latter and perplexed as I was with doubt and apprehension I followed this advice  END OF VOL IV
