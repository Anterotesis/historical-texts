as I had determined to lay before the public the ensuing Sketches I could not hesitate in choosing whose name I should wish might honour the introduction of them into the worldTo whom could a work of this nature with so much propriety be addressed as to him who had not only relinquished for a series of years all the allurements that a polished nation could display to opulence and early age but had exposed  himself to numberless perils and the repeated risk of life itself that he might attain higher degrees of that knowledge which these sketches are intended to commemorate in his predecessors and countrymen and as the result of which he has enlarged the stock of natural science beyond all prior example  That liberality Sir with which you impart the fruit of your various labours and that distinguished patronage you so amply afford to natural history at large and to botanical science in particular as they demand so have they justly secured to you the grateful acknowledgments of all lovers of that science and of literature and philosophy in general  I have Sir on this occasion only to regret that my distant situation has not allowed me in the compilation of these pages those benefits which your most extensive and valuable library would have held forth to me  and of which you so generously permit the communication to such as desire to avail themselves of its advantages  Permit me then Sir to have the honour of inscribing to you the following SKETCHES as to an eminent and no less candid judge of the subject and as a public testimony of that most perfect respect and esteem with which I am  DEAR SIR  Your much obliged and Most obedient humble Servant RICHARD PULTENEY  BLANDFORD  FEB  PREFACE  IN the enlightened ages of Greece and Rome and under the most flourishing state of Arabian literature Botany as a science had no existence Nor was it till some time after the revival of learning that those combinations and distinctions were effectually discovered which in the end by giving rise to system have raised the study of plants to that rank it holds at present in the scale of knowledge  If in the contemplation of flowers mankind at large have in every age placed one of their purest pleasures how greatly must these delights be enhanced to the enamoured votary of Botanical Knowledge who whilst he surveys that wonderfully varied elegance and beauty which charm the eye of all penetrates still farther and at the same instant discerns also those analogies and discriminations  in the  number figure situation  and  proportion  of parts on which are laid the foundations of modern Botanical Science associations and distinctions which are veiled from the untaught eye of common observation howsoever sensible to the general beauties of Nature And hence independently of its real and ultimate utility from the accession of knowledge it brings to the Materia Medica and by its general assistance to the various arts and elegancies of life the study of the vegetable kingdom has proved to numerous speculative and inquisitive minds the source of much intellectual enjoyment  This Science is by many considered as of so easy attainment that it is not unusual to assign the name of Botanist to any man whose memory enables him to repeat the nomenclature of perhaps a few hundred plants howsoever uninformed he may be of those principles which entitle him to the real name and character With equal justice might any man who knows the names only of the parts of a complex machine assume to himself that fame which is due  solely to the inventor of it By this degrading idea men of the first learning and talents in this branch of knowledge have frequently been levelled with the most superficial enquirers and the most ignorant pretenders Hence also this Science which even in a speculative view holds no mean rank and considered practically is closely connected with medicine and with the arts and elegancies of life has been held forth as a trifling and futile employment In truth he properly is entitled in any degree to the character of the Botanist whose acquirements enable him to investigate to describe and systematically arrange any plant which comes under his cognizance But to these abilities in order to compleat the character should be united an acquaintance with the Philosophy of Vegetables and with the History of the Science in all its several relations both literary and practical from remote antiquity to his own time attainments which require a competent share of general learning and no small degree of painful toil and patient industry both in the fields and in the closet  If this description of the Botanist be a true one it manifestly excludes a number of frivolous pretenders the science itself rises in importance and admits of great diversity of employment to the taste the talents and learning of those who direct their attention to it Whilst then it is the province of some to investigate new subjects to ascertain those imperfectly known and to record the various improvements and discoveries of the day let it be that of others to do justice to departed merit to recall the scattered remembrances of the lives and hold out the example of those who have laboured in the same field before them  In tracing the progress of human knowledge through its several gradations of improvement it is scarcely possible for an inquisitive and liberal mind of congenial taste not to feel an ardent wish of information relating to those persons by whom such improvements have severally been given and hence arises that interesting sympathy which almost inseparably connects biography with the history of each respective branch of knowledge  In this age when successful advancements in the study of plants have so far extended its pleasures as to render Botany almost fashionable and at a time when Biographical writings find a reception heretofore unknown it became matter of speculation that no one should have delineated the  Rise and Progress of Botany in Britain  in connexion with the lives of those who have contributed to amplify and embellish it  Among the various enquiries which employ the pens of the learned none perhaps afford more general satisfaction than such as relate to the origin and progress of science and literature But when these lead to objects which we love and cherish they come recommended by a charm that secures a welcome and thus promise a more peculiar entertainment and gratification however disquisitions of this kind are of difficult execution especially when applied to subjects of a scientific nature as requiring the union of various talents in the writeran appropriate share of learning an extensive literary as well as practical acquaintance with the subject united to all those qualifications requisite  in a biographer such as diligence and accuracy in investigating the discoveries of his authors and impartiality in characterizing them and in assigning to each his due degree of merit To these personal requisites must be added the adventitious circumstances of a situation favourable to his researches not only from manuscripts and large libraries but from actual intercourse with the learned  Fully sensible in this view of the little claim I have to the character and advantages here spoken of it becomes necessary to avoid the censure of temerity that I should premise some account of the original occasion of this attempt  The attention I had given to English Botany in my younger days had prompted me at one time to plan a  Flora  of the plants of this kingdom on an extensive scale including besides the medical and oeconomical history of each a  Pinax  in which it was my design to have distinguished as far as I was able the first discoverer of each species both among foreign writers and those of our own kingdom and to have  arranged all their synonyms at large under each plant in chronological order To such a work the following  sketches  in a somewhat more contracted form were intended as an introduction In the mean time if more important avocations had not the want of necessary assistance from books would probably have stopped the progress of a plan of such extent Although this purpose was relinquished yet as the materials were collected and this part of the design was independent of the other I flattered myself that having made some alterations and enlarged the whole under so total a want of any similar work these anecdotes might afford information to young Botanists and possibly some amusement to those of more advanced knowledge in the science  Although botanical writings are the principal objects of these pages yet as several of these authors were conspicuous for their various attainments in different branches of literature their other pursuits and publications where my resources have afforded opportunity have occasionally been recited  and I have been more particularly solicitous to collect into one view under each author those various temporary and occasional productions which after the establishment of the Royal Society were communicated to that body and form a part of the  Philosophical Transactions  In considering the botanical writings especially those of the first eminence I have had recourse with few exceptions to the books themselves but confined to a private collection have yet too frequently had occasion to regret the want of more extensive assistance and although I have not formally quoted my authorities on every occasion they will be sufficiently manifest to all such as are conversant in botanical literature In the historical and biographical parts the most material and authentic facts have likewise been derived from the respective authors in botany and not unfrequently I have availed myself of several of the older periodical publications Exclusively of these besides collateral assistance received from separate works and from various collections of smaller bulk I more especially  acknowledge my obligation to the authors recited below  GESNERI Bibliotheca Universalis fol  Tigur  et  ejusd  Epitome à  Simlero  et  Frisio  fol item  ejusdem

England  and to assign to each writer his respective praise I could have wished to have subjoined a complete  catalogue of all the English plants with the names of the first discoverer annexed or of

could have afforded gratification only to the more curious and critical botanists unless thrown into a form by the addition of other matter which would have increased the bulk of this work to another

that they will find that reception from learned and candid judges which such are wont to bestow on a first essay in any department of literature  TABLE of CHAPTERS IN VOLUME I  Ch  PRIMAEVAL Botany

Saxon  version of  Apuleius  PRIMAEVAL BOTANY  THE origin of Botany considered in the most extensive view must have been coeval with man Before the invention of arts the discovery of metals and the use of implements and arms by which animals were more immediately subjected  to their power it must be supposed that the human race derived from the vegetable creation the chief part of their sustenance and the primary conveniences of life Roots fruits and herbs must then have constituted the food of man Trials and experience would teach him all that choice and variety which his different situations allowed The same faithful directors would insensibly inform him of the various qualities and the different effects of them on his body As the sphere of his observations and experience enlarged he would derive the knowledge and distinction of such as were of easy or of difficult digestion He would discover the slatulent kinds and such as corrected slatulency which opened or which constipated the body which was most nutritive and probably by fatal accicidents which were poisonous Hence the rudiments of medical science  This various knowledge would be handed down traditionally from one generation to another and with it the names of such as were happily the first discoverers of new aliments or medicinal properties would  descend with increasing reverence until involved in obscurity by length of time superstition raised them to the rank of gods Thus in the early ages of mankind as now among the still unlettered and uncultivated nations of the earth the administration of simples for the cure of wounds and diseases was almost ever accompanied with superstitious ceremonies and incantations Hence too in process of time the character of the priest and the physician was united and the sick resorted to the temples of the gods for relief and although investigation and rational science made slow progress yet in every nation from the most cultivated to the most barbarous the number of simples used for medicinal purposes became by degrees very considerable Thus when at length physic assumed a more regular form and was taught in the schools of Greece the writings of HIPPOCRATES enumerate three hundred vegetables used in physic Four centuries afterwards they were augmented by DIOSCORIDES to near seven hundred and to these the Arabians added no inconsiderable number of valuable  articles There is room to believe that the antient  Gymnosophists  of the East pursued the study of plants with a success equal to that of the Greeks and the modern nations of the East the Japonese the Chinese and the Brachmans of India incontestibly excel the enlightened nations of Greece and Rome in their knowledge of Botany witness the "Garden of Malabar" which comprehends near eight hundred plants all which are described and the virtues recorded with an accuracy and precision unexampled in the antient authors of  Greece  and  Rome  But to approach nearer home the Druids of  Gaul  and of  Britain  cultivated the knowledge of herbs with no inconsiderable diligence Whether these antient  Magi  of the West who were both priests and physicians sprung from those of the East and thus derived their knowledge from a common source a point which has hitherto divided the learned or whether their science was the result of their own investigation I must leave to the critical antiquary to determine  DRUIDICAL BOTANY  In the mean time in tracing the origin and progress of botanical science in  Britain  a survey of its state in the druidical times ought to claim the first attention but in fact the little information transmitted to us from the antients relating to this extraordinary sect being almost wholly confined to  Caesar  and  Pliny  precludes any enlarged view respecting my particular object It is from  Pliny  we learn that to the  misseltoe  the  vervain  the  selago  and the  samolus  these antient fathers of druidism attributed efficacies almost divine and ordained the collection and administration of them with rites and ceremonies not short of religious strictness and such as countenanced the grossest superstition  The  misseltoe  for instance must be cut only with a golden knife must be gathered when the moon was six days old the priest cloathed in white the plant received on a white napkin and lastly two white bulls were to be sacrificed and thus consecrated  misseltoe was an antidote to poison and prevented sterility  Pliny  lib xvi c    The  misseltoe  perhaps is of these plants the only one fully ascertained at this time Its parasitical growth the preference which the Druids gave to that which grew on the oak assisted by the descriptions the antients have left of it will sufficiently justify the application to the  viscum  of the moderns May I not add that probably amidst the manifold virtues antiently ascribed to this plant its power of curing the fallingsickness which has accompanied it almost to the present time is the remnant of druidical use and tradition  The  vervain  after previous libations of honey was to be gathered at the rising of the dogstar when neither sun nor moon shone with the left hand only after describing a circle round the plant c and thus prepared it vanquished fevers and other distempers was an antidote to the bite of serpents and a charm to conciliate friendship  Ib  lib xxv c    With respect to this herb the  hierobotane  the  sacra herba  of DIOSCORIDES although the modern botanists have now agreed to confine the term to the  verbena  which PLINY has described as having narrower and smaller leaves than the oak it may be remarked that there has been a diversity of opinions among the commentators relating to the plant and it is acknowledged that  verbena  or  verbenacea  was also applied as a general term for all plants used about the altar in sacrifices To this day the Tuscans apply the word  vervena  to slips shoots suckers or bundles of plants of any kind  The  selago  was not to be cut with iron nor touched with the naked hand but with the  sagum  the Druid cloathed in white and his feet naked with other magic ceremonies Thus collected and consecrated it became a remedy for diseased eyes and a charm against misfortunes  Ib  lib xxiv c    It is nevertheless equally difficult to determine the  selago  of the Druids PLINY  having only described it as like the  savin  a description which will accord with a variety of plants of Europe Most authors nevertheless have agreed from this resemblance to consider it as a species of  wolfsclaw moss  which is now called  lycopodium selago  CAESALPINUS however thinks it was a  sedum  and GUILANDINUS an  erica  or heath and probably with more reason  Various but equally superstitious were the rites attendant on the  samolus  which was given to preserve oxen and swine from diseases  This is a plant of which still greater doubts remain PLINY having said nothing further of it than that it grew in moist places Hence the name is applied to a plant called  roundleav d brooklime  but as forming a separate genus in modern arrangements it has acquired the name given as above from  Pliny  Others have thought it a species of  pulsatilla  or pasqueflower since one of that kind retains among the Bolognese the name of  samiglo  The same uncertainty attends all disquisitions relating to the  herba Britannica  of  DIOSCORIDES and PLINY famed for having cured the soldiers of  Julius Caesar  on the Rhine of the  Scelotyrbe  or the disease supposed to be our sea scurvy The uses of this herb were thought to have been derived from the Britons the name suggested this notion but later etymologists have found a different derivation i e Brit  consolidare  Tan  Deus Ica  s Hica  ejectio  unde  Britannica dicitur herba quae firmet et consolidat dentes vacillantes  RAY  Hist Plant  i p  The commentators have applied the description given by those two antients to a variety of simples By some it has been thought to be the  polygonum persicaria  or spotted arsmart by others the  primula auricula  or wild auricula by our own first herbalist TURNER who observed it plentifully in  Friesland  the scene of  Pliny  's observations on its effects the  polygonum bistorta  or bistort at length  Abraham  MUNTING a Dutch physician published a treatise in professedly to prove that the  Britannica  was the  hydrolapathum magnum rumex  aquaticus  or great water dock In this opinion RAY and others have acquiesced  I should not have dwelt so long on these circumstances but to shew the mortifying uncertainty attending the application of the names of plants from the antients arising from their vague and indecisive descriptions I add that Mr LIGHTFOOT thinks there are sufficient traces in the highlands of the high esteem in which the Druids held the quickentree or mountain ash  sorbus aucuparia  It is more frequently than any other tree found planted in the neighbourhood of druidical circles of stones so often seen in Scotland Possibly this fact may be more equivocal than the superstitious uses to which it is still applied It is believed that a small part of this tree carried about them is a charm against witchcraft and enchantment The dairymaid drives the cattle with a switch of the  roantree  for so it is called in the highlands as a security against the same direful evils and in one part of  Scotland  the sheep and lambs are on the first of May ever made to pass through a hoop of  roanwood  Short and imperfect as this view of Druidical Botany may be as delivered to us by PLINY yet there can be no doubt that the Britons like all other rude nations drew their medicinal sources from the simples growing around them and were therefore well acquainted with common plants And although there are not as far as I know any herbals extant in the antient British language or in any translation from it by which the degree and extent of their knowledge may be precisely ascertained yet as far as respects the nomenclature merely some reasonable estimate may I apprehend be formed from the list of  Welch  names of plants preserved by GERARD as communicated to him by Mr  Davies  of  Guissaney  in  Flintshire  from the  Irish  names as we find them in Mr HEATON's catalogue printed in THRELKELD's  Synopsis  to which I may add the  Erse  names communicated by the Rev Mr  Stuart  to the late excellent and muchlamented botanist the Rev Mr LIGHTFOOT These lists might without doubt be greatly amplified by the assiduity of skilful botanists  well versed in the respective languages THRELKELD's list which is the most copious comprehends near four hundred names and the analogy perceivable between these and the  Erse  names sufficiently marks a common origin I

regardless of health as not to have a knowledge of and some dependence upon the virtues of certain simples There is sufficient evidence that our Saxon ancestors did  not wholly disregard this study since although rare there are manuscript Saxon herbals extant in several public libraries The two following occur in the Bodleian  HERBARIUM Saxonice  LIBER MEDICINALIS  continens virtutes herbarum  Saxonice  I am unable to determine whether the above are the same with the two following which Dr  Ducarel  notices from the Harleian collection  Entitled HERBARIUM Saxonice    Tractatus qui ab AngloSaxonibus dicebatur  LIBER MEDICINALIS  The last is said to be an AngloSaxon version of APULEIUS whom I shall have occasion to mention hereafter The date of this translation is of the tenth century The Saxons having been converted to Christianity at the latter end of the sixth century the communication between  Britain  and  Rome  became by degrees very frequent  and learning was then first introduced into these realms  The golden age if I may be allowed that expression of the AngloSaxon learning was the reign of ALFRED the Great That munificent prince not only himself translated Latin authors but as historians inform us encouraged in every way the transfusion of all the knowledge of the times into the common language of the kingdom To this aera therefore may reasonably be referred the Saxon version of APULEIUS whose book seems to have preserved popularity through all the middle ages and was found in common use at the aera of printing  As no publication of any  Saxon  herbal has ever taken place we are unable to define the extent of the knowledge of that time at present therefore as in the instance of antient  British  Botany we can only recur to the nomenclature of the indigenous names by which some of them are yet known although many others have given way to Greek and Latin terms and some to other revolutions occasioned by the  gradual progress of reformation throughout the science in general  A list of the  AngloSaxon  names would be recoverable in a great degree by recurring to the old herbals to SKINNER's Lexicon and other authorities of that kind It would I am persuaded be more extensive than a superficial view might suggest and would do credit to our Saxon ancestors I cannot help remarking that many mistakes have probably arisen from the neglect of our first reformers of Botany in  England  after they had formed scientific names in not preserving also the old and provincial terms and that on the whole this neglect has retarded the progress of knowledge on this subject  CHAP  General state of Botanical knowledge during the dominion of the  Saracens  Corrupt translations of  DioscoridesAvicennaAschard  or  Ebn

science follow the fate of empires On the decline of those of  Greece  and  Rome  and during that period in which the Saxons were establishing themselves in  Britain  medical knowledge passed into the hands of the triumphant Saracens  Bagdat  under the Eastern Caliphs became the seat of learning Much of the Greek physic and philosophy was corruptly translated by the command of Musselmen among whom at length it  received due reception and encouragement Schools were established in which ARISTOTLE GALEN DIOSCORIDES and other writers were studied and their doctrines at length pervaded the whole dominion of the Saracens and finally flourished in the universities of  Spain  DIOSCORIDES though in a corrupt and mutilated state formed the basis of knowledge in the  Botany  and Materia Medica of the Arabians The situation of  Bagdat  and its connection with  India  allowed them scope to introduce into physic feveral useful simples Among others we owe to these Orientals the milder purges of the present day such as  senna cassia fistula manna tamarinds rhubarb  and several drugs of other qualities of which some retain a place in the present reformed state of the  Materia Medica  AVICENNA we are told had coloured drawings for the instruction of his pupils in Botany and  Prosper  ALPINUS assures us he saw at  Cairo  a volume of paintings of the plants of  Aegypt Arabia  and  Ethiopia  which had been done for the use of a Sultan  It is not easy however to judge with precision of the extent of Arabian knowledge on the subject of our work since probably the best book of the Arabian school has yet remained unpublished that of  Ebn  BEITHAR It is extant in the Parisian the Escurial and other libraries This learned Arab was particularly attached to the botanical branch of physic He was born in  Spain  and after visiting  Africa  travelled into the Levant  Asia  and even as far as the Indies to improve his knowledge In his return he was patronised by  Saladin  at  Cairo  and died in  HERBELOT informs us that from the superiority of his learning in this branch he was styled  Aschard  or The Botanist He wrote "A General History of Simples or of Plants ranged in alphabetical order" in which he gives the Greek Arabic and vernacular names with the descriptions of each and particularly in a more detailed manner those not described by DIOSCORIDES and PLINY  There is notwithstanding but little room to believe that more original knowledge  could be derived from the Arabian monuments of science in this than in the other departments of physic In their best authors even the Greek names of plants are so grossly perverted that they are scarcely to be known  The Grecian authors having been inaccurately translated at first and the language neglected afterwards physic lost much under the dominion of the Arabians It was in the end a corrupt Galenic theory with an admixture of  astrology  and superstition In this state the learned of Europe found it in the celebrated Moorish universities of  Spain  In the western parts of Christendom especially after the lapse of the Latin tongue in  Italy  it was scarcely less obscured by the ignorance of the Monks by whom almost solely the practice of it was engrossed  Even the first university in Christendom the renowned school of  Salernum  founded by  Charlemagne  in the beginning of the ninth century received its dictates from the corrupt sources of the Arabians whose works are said to have been at length translated  into Latin by  Constantine  the African The famous precepts  de Conservanda Valetudine  issued from that school for the use of  Robert  duke of Normandy were without doubt well known in England and probably excited attention to the study of Vegetables concerning which numerous rules and cautions occur in that remnant of the learning of those days  During all these ages the original sources in the Greek authors were almost wholly forgotten and the productions of that long night of science were equally rare and unimproving  I shall nevertheless enumerate briefly a few of those English authors who were most conspicuous for any attention to the simples used in medicine which alone bounded the botanical knowledge of those times  One of our earliest writers after the Conquest was the historian HENRY  Archdeacon of Huntingdon  in the time of king Stephen and Henry the IId  Bishop  TANNER informs us that he left a MS in  eight Books  De  HERBIS  de Aromatibus et de Gemmis  Bib Bodley  Of nearly the same age are said to be some manuscripts preserved in  Bibl Regia Lond  under the following titles  De Natura Pecudum  ARBORUM  et Lapidum  and one De  Naturis Herbarum  Bishop  Tanner  mentions an Englishman of the name of  Henry  ARVIEL who had travelled much and resided some time at  Bologna  about the year He left a manuscript  De Botanica sive Stirpium Varia Historia  The same author notices a manuscript in the Sloanean collection of  John  BRAY who lived in the time of Richard the IId He studied Botany and Physic and received an annual pension from the king for his knowledge and skill in these sciences It is entitled  Synonyma de nominibus Herbarum  It contains the names in Latin French and English  Besides the  Compendium Medicinae  of GILBERTUS LEGLE or GILBERTUS ANGLICUS who also flourished in the thirteenth century a manuscript is recorded of  that author under the title of  De re Herbaria lib  and others  De Viribus et Medicinis Herbarum Arborum et Specierum et de Virtutibus Herbarum lib    The famous English surgeon  John  ARDERN of Newark extolled

manuscripts though the dates have not been precisely determined are with good reason supposed to have been written if not prior to the invention of printing at least before the introduction of that art into England  This list perhaps already too long might have been considerably extended but that it would have unnecessarily swelled this article As none of these manuscripts however have been published the exact state and progress of the science cannot be ascertained yet enough is seen to convince us that although its advancemnet was slow and inconsiderable it was not wholly lost in the darkness of that night which for so many ages obscured the sources of knowledge It is highly probable that  very few of the manuscripts before enumerated exhibit any considerable portion of original matter but that they are principally extracts and compilations from preceding writers of the lower age such as  Apuleius Aemilius Macer S Sethus Isidore Constantinus  the  Pandects  of  Matthew Sylvaticus Platearius  some of the later Arabians and other writers of that stamp At the renovation of knowledge just mentioned these appear to have been the primary sources from which our ancestors of that generation derived assistance since we find many MSS of the above authors  were in being at the origin of printing and were early issued from the press as the manuals of that day in various parts of Christendom  It has been observed that the lastmentioned Saxon manuscript was a translation of  Lucius  APULEIUS  Madaurensis  whose work from several other circumstances there is room to believe was at that time more diffused and popular in  England  than any other This author who lived in the age of the  Antonines  was born at  Madura  in  Africa  at that time a seat of learning He afterwards studied at  Carthage  and at  Athens  and for some time applied himself at  Rome  to jurisprudence but at length quitted it and devoted himself wholly to philosophy and physic He is well known as the author of the  Milesian  Fables and other works of learning His book  De Herbis sive de Nominibus ac Virtutibus Herbarum  alone comes under our cognizance In this he recites the names of medicinal herbs in the Greek Latin Egyptian Punic Celtic and Dacian and of some in the oriental languages  These names form the bulk of the book which consists of one hundred and thirty chapters After each name follows a short description of the plant the place of growth and the properties Then the discases to which each simple is applicable The work nevertheless abounds with gross errors in the names of plants and inculcates the most absurd ceremonies and superstitions in the administration of remedies yet it was in much esteem throughout the dark ages of literature  It must not however be concealed that some of the learned have judged that this work at least as it now appears was not written by the author whose name it bears but at a much later period JOHNSON the editor of  Gerard  imagined it to be a translation of a Greek writer of the eighth century but his conjecture is not thought probable by  Fabricius  b Latin ab Ernesto  Lips tom p  The remarks of  Johnson  prove that this work was in common use in the ages I have spoken of and that the copies had been greatly corrupted and mutilated by ignorant hands  I will give one instance from APULEIUS of that credulity and superstition which sanctioned by antiquity yet prevailed in the administration of remedies and exhibits a melancholy proof of the wretched state of physic which through so many ages had not broke the shackles of druidical magic and imposition As a cure for a disease called by the French  Nouè l'Equillette  you are directed to take seven stalks of the herb  lionsfoot  separated from the roots these are to be boiled in water in the wane of the moon The patient is to be washed with this water on the approach of night standing before the threshold on the outside of his own house and the person who performs this office for the sick is also not to fail to wash himself This done the sick person is to be fumigated with the smoke of the herb  Aristolochia  and both persons are then to enter into the house together taking strict care not to look behind them while returning after which adds the author the sick will immediately become well  A book under the name of MACER's  Herbal  seems also to have been in common use in  England  before the aera of printing Authors do not allow it to be the production of  Aemilius  MACER quoted by OVID but of much later date and by some it is ascribed to ODO or ODOBONUS a physician of the later times and probably a Frenchman This barbarous poem is in leonine verse and is entitled  De Naturis Qualitatibus Virtutibus Herbarum  Divers manuscripts of it are extant in the English libraries as at  Cambridge  in the  Bodleian Ashmolean  and  Sloanean  collections  It was translated into English as Bishop TANNER informs us by  John  LELAMAR master of  Hereford  school who lived about the year His manuscript is referred to as in  Sloane  's library Even LINACRE did not disdain to employ himself on this work "MACER's HERBAL practysyd by Doctor Linacro translated out of Latin into English London mo" AMES mentions an edition of it printed in and  Palmer  one without date printed by  Wyre  This jejune performance which is written wholly on Galenic principles  treats on the virtues of not more than eightyeight simples  I shall not detain the reader by dwelling on other authors of this class whose names I have before recited it will be sufficient to observe that fettered as were the theories of this time with astrology and a strange mixture of the Galenic doctrine of the four elements it extended its influence not to the human body alone but to all the instruments of physic Not even a plant of medicinal use but was placed under the dominion of some planet and must neither be gathered nor applied but with observances that savoured of the most absurd superstition  CHAP  Manuscripts of the  Patres Botanici  scarce in  England  Restoration of ancient knowledge by the publications of  Pliny Dioscorides  and  Theophrastus  The aera of commentatorsRise of true investigation by  Brunsfelsius Tragus Cordus  and  Gesner  Famous MS of  Dioscorides  with illuminated figures  MIDDLE AGES  AT this time manuscripts of THEOPHRASTUS DIOSCORIDES and PLINY were not only exceedingly rare throughout Europe but those of the two former were unnoticed through ignorance of the Greek language otherwise we cannot suppose our ancestors could have neglected them for the crude and barbarous works which have been mentioned It was not till the opening of the fifteenth century that opportunity was given to recur to these repositories of antient lore The flight of the Greeks into  Italy  at the subversion of the Eastern Empire and the subsequent  invention of printing by bringing to light and disseminating the purer remains of  Greece  and  Rome  at length broke the chains of barbarism and superstition which during so many ages had tyrannized over the understandings of mankind  On this happy revolution Botany with other sciences revived and presently resumed another appearance The publication of the  Patres Botanici  raised at once a spirit of emulation to investigate the subjects of their works  PLINY was first printed if not at  Verona  in as is affirmed by some and doubted by others at least in the succeeding year at  Venice  and the avidity with which it was received is manifested by the numerous impressions of it before the end of that century  DIOSCORIDES came forth first at  Cologn  in a Latin translation in and in the original by  Aldus  in It was afterwards published in Latin by HERMOLAUS BARBARUS and RUELLIUS in the year by VERGILIUS in and by CORNARUS in The learned now  prefer the edition with a translation by SARACENUS printed at  Lyons  in  THEOPHRASTUS was first printed in Greek at  Venice  without date and by  Aldus  in and He was translated into Latin by GAZA in and this version has been preferred by succeeding writers  The restoration of these sages of antiquity immediately raised up a numerous set of commentators Every plant was sought for and every plant was discovered in the works of antiquity No drug used in medicine was esteemed  true  unless found in DIOSCORIDES  Scaliger  wrote animadversions on THEOPHRASTUS in in which he has corrected the version of  Gaza  in many places Robert  Constantine  produced the parallel places in PLINY and BODAEUS à STAPEL in astonished the world by a display of erudition on this author in which he exhausted all farther disquisition by the profusion of his remarks and collations from all preceding writers  The commentaries on DIOSCORIDES have been more numerous The  Corollaria  of HERMOLAUS BARBARUS was published in To  Hermolaus  succeeded BRUNSFELSIUS  Petrus Leydensis  LACUNA AMATUS LUSITANUS  Robert  CONSTANTINE  Val  CORDUS and several others and finally MATTHIOLUS whose work has superseded the rest It was first printed in and passed through seventeen editions If we may believe one of the correspondents of this author thirtytwo thousand copies had been sold before the year  MATTHIOL  Oper Omn  Ed  in Epist  p  The best edition with the accessions of CASPAR BAUHINE in still finds a reputable place in modern libraries  Among the illustrators of PLINY  Hermolaus Barbarus  in stood foremost His  Castigationes Plinianae  were published in in which he successfully corrected the text and LEONICENUS in the same year was the first who employed critical knowledge on this author The corruptions of the text afforded great scope afterwards to GALENIUS RHENANUS PINTIANI  and others The  Exercitationes Plinianae  of SALMASIUS are well known Those of the laborious and paradoxical HARDUIN are the principal resort of modern times  It is a mortifying reflexion in the annals of human knowledge that the bulk of these learned men after their immense labours mistook in numberless instances the road to truth and did but perplex the science they wished to enlighten The descriptions of plants in the antient authors were at best short vague and insufficient and with this inconvenience the study of nature herself was neglected In the mean time there arose a genuine set of cultivators who discovering this error of the commentators studied plants in the fields where alone the best comments could be made As the foremost of these stands BRUNSFELSIUS He was followed by TRAGUS FUCHSIUS  Val  CORDUS GESNER CAESALPINUS and above all CLUSIUS to whom must be added our own countryman TURNER Still even among these genuine restorers of natural knowledge many did  not sufficiently recollect that all the plants of DIOSCORIDES were not those of  Europe  but principally those of  Asia  whilst instead of traversing the fields of  Greece Cilicia  and the East they were straining all the descriptions of this author to accommodate them to the vegetables of  Europe  It is not strange that their endeavours were but little successful Even after the labours of RAUWOLF who traversed  Syria Mesopotomia Palestine  and  Aegypt  in the sixteenth century and those of the enlightened TOURNEFORT in the present it does not appear that of the seven hundred plants in the  Materia Medica  of DIOSCORIDES more than four hundred at the farthest are properly ascertained at this time  We learn from PLINY lib c that there were paintings of plants in his day but he complains that through the inaccuracy of copiers they were not to be depended on SALMASIUS tells us he inspected a Greek MS of DIOSCORIDES more than a thousand years old in which the plants were figured with sufficient elegance indeed but with little regard to truth  and exact resemblance There are now existing several manuscripts of DIOSCORIDES with illuminated figures particularly the famous one in the imperial library at  Vienna  of which LAMBECIUS treats largely  It was procured by  Busbequius  the emperor's resident at  Constantinople  about and is said to have been copied at the expence of JULIANA ANICIA daughter to the emperor  Flavius Anicius Olyber  about the year It has been regretted by some of the learned that this MS had not been brought earlier into  Europe  by which means the commentators might have been saved much trouble Antient however and splendid as this is it may justly be doubted whether the publication of it would have much conduced to the restoration of ancient Botany and  Materia Medica  since if we are allowed to judge of the figures from the specimens copied by DODONAEUS nothing can exceed the rudeness of them or more strongly justify the remark of  Salmasius  And as several of these are copied into GERARD's Herbal for the  satisfaction of the curious I refer in the note  Coronopus  Dod ed p Ger em  Arction  Dod Park  Hyssopus  Dod  Hippophaës  Dod  Aconitum Lycoctonum  Dod Ger em  Staebe  Dod Ger em  Lotus Sylvestris  Dod  Lotus Aegyptia  Dod  Tithymalus Dendroides  Dod Ger em  to some of these figures in both authors  In justice however to these valuable remains it must be observed that from later information we find there is besides this  Constantinopolitan  MS which is in folio another supposed to be more ancient in to which is distinguished by the name of  Neapolitan  that the figures in both these agree extremely well and as  Haller  informs us are sufficiently exact to enable the botanical traveller with such drawings in his hands to distinguish the plants of DIOSCORIDES in the native places of growth It is particularly specified that the  periclymenum  of these manuscripts evidently appears  to be the  convolvulus major  of the moderns and the  telephium  the  cerinthe minor  Finally that if those enumerated in the note so ill express the plants designed it must be wholly attributed to the fault of the copier or engraver This intelligence is attended with regret when we further learn that after some of these icons were lately engraved with a view to the publication of the whole the design has been laid aside  I shall be thought perhaps in the foregoing pages to have digressed too much I have to allege that a brief view of the general state and progress of physic with which my subject is inseparably connected during the dominion of the Saracens in the East and in the ages of ignorance preceding the fourteenth century in the West seemed necessary in order to throw light on the introduction of it into this island And as  England  shared the improvement arising from the restoration of antient knowledge a short notice of the three principal botanic authors was deemed not less proper  At this distance of time perhaps it may require some warmth of imagination to picture to the mind that satisfaction which ingenuous and learned men must have experienced who lived when the veil was removed which for ages had obscured and confined those elegant sources of intellectual enjoyments which the writings of the antients display when the means of attaining them were by the invention of printing so happily amplified and the progress not only of those arts and sciences which embellish but of those which also dignify human nature by their utility was no longer retarded  CHAP  Account of the earliest Botanical publications on the ContinentThe  Book of Nature  The  Herbarius  The  Hortus Sanitatis  These works the basis of the "  Grete Herbal  " in the first Botanical publication in  England  Account of that work  AschamCopland  both herbalists of the astrologic sectFirst Botanical gardens  HORTUS SANITATIS  IT was not till several years after the aera of printing that any original work strictly botanical made its appearance even on the continent and still longer before  England  produced any publication of importance in that way  Previous to the first dawning of this science in  England  it is almost necessary to mention some of the productions abroad as they were the basis of what was here first published although in fact there was no original work before the  Herbal  of TURNER  In the opinion of SEGUIER the first book on plants with figures was printed  at  Augsburgh  soon after the invention of wooden cuts or tables between the years and in the German tongue with the title of "  The Book of Nature  " It treats of animals and plants of the latter a hundred and seventysix kinds are noticed and many of them figured The work is made up chiefly from PLINY  Isidore  and  Platearius  This book seems to have been soon superseded by the famous Herbal of  Mentz  in stiled simply "HERBARIUS" which gave rise the next year to the wellknown work ORTUS SANITATIS ascribed to CUBA a physician of  Augsburgh  and afterwards of  Frankfort  who if not the author was at least the editor of an enlarged and improved edition This work under different editors was the basis of all the  Herbals  of  Europe  for many years  Its object is the  Materia Medica  from all nature but vegetables occupy the greater part The first edition was comprised in four hundred and thirtyfive chapters in one printed at Venice in which is in the black letter they are extended to a  thousand and sixtysix of which one half treat on the vegetable kingdom The author professes to have drawn his resources from HIPPOCRATES GALEN PLINY AVICENNA SERAPION MESUES DIOSCORIDES PLATEARIUS VINCENTIUS the  Pandects  PALLADIUS CONSTANTIN ALMANSER and others At the head of each chapter stands a cut than which scarcely any thing can be conceived more rude and in some cases nothing is more puerile or ridiculous The pages if printed with numbers would amount to more than seven hundred Many copies of this performance are remaining although the  Herbarius  is become very scarce  GRETE HERBAL  These books were undoubtedly the foundation of the first printed botanical work of any consequence or popularity in  England  and which appeared under the title of "The GRETE HERBAL with cuts" printed for  Peter Treveris  as  Ames  tells us in Before the impression of this book in  England  some editions of the "Herbarius"  on the continent had been augmented so far as to contain five hundred figures of plants The "Grete Herbal" seems to have been well received in  England  since there are subsequent copies which bear the following dates and in the Continuation of  Ames  an edition is mentioned of the "Great Herbal" about the year "without the cuts" There is also an edition of this book so late as the year which is ten years after the date of TURNER's "Herbal" That of bears the following title  "  The  GRETE HERBALL  whiche geveth parfyt knowledge understandyng of all manner of Herbes and there gracyous vertues which God hath ordeyned for our prosperous welfare helth for they hele and cure all manner of dyseases sekenesses that fall or misfortune to all manner of creatoures of God created practysed by many

pages would make three hundred and fifty exclusive of the Preface and Index It includes the animal vegetable and mineral substances used in medicine and is said in the Introduction to be  "compyled composed and auctorysed by divers and many noble Doctours and expert Maysters in Medycynes as  Avicenna Pandecta Constantinus Wilhelmus Platearius Rabbi Moyses Johannes Mesue Haly Albertus Bartholomeus  and more other c"  There is no author's name to it but there are indubitable traces of its being  fabricated  from the  Hortus Sanitatis  and probably from the French translation of that work printed by  Caron  at  Paris  in with some alterations and additions  It abounds with the barbarous and misspelt names of the middle ages and is undoubtedly the work which TURNER refers  to in the Preface to his "Herbal" where he observes that  "as yet there was no English Herbal but one al full of unlearned cacographees and falsely naming of herbs"  The general order is that of the alphabet according to the Latin names each subject forming a chapter in the whole five hundred and five of which more than four hundred respect the vegetable productions and of these one hundred and fifty bear the names of plants which are natives of  England  but the writer remarks no other distinction by which they are known from the exotics The names are given in Latin and English but throughout the whole scarcely any descriptions The qualities whether  hot  or  cold dry  or  moist  according to the Galenic mode of the time is invariably noticed followed generally by a prolix account of the diseases to which the plant is applicable and the method of using it  To each is prefixed a coarse woodencut figure as in the  Hortus Sanitatis  from  which on a somewhat smaller scale they are evidently copied consisting generally of outlines only Each block is two inches high and nearly as wide Many of these figures are fictitious and many misplaced In a variety of instances the same figure is prefixed to different plants and in very few are they sufficiently expressive of the habit to discriminate even a wellknown subject if the name applied did not suggest the idea of it In some these icons are whimsically absurd especially in the animals and minerals being also copies of those in the  Hortus Sanitatis  Those of the  Mandrake  for example exhibit two perfectly human figures with the plant growing from the head of each though to do the writer justice he acknowledges that no such thing exists in nature At the end is subjoined "an explanation of some terms" and "a tract on urines"  ASCHAM  Anthony  ASCHAM a priest and vicar of  Burnishton  in  Yorkshire  to which he was  preferred by  Edward  VI after a liberal education which it might have been expected would have secured him from such delusion gave himself up to the study of astrology on which subject he published several tracts He wrote also "on the Leap Year" and the following  "A LYTTEL HERBAL of the

gardens a new species of luxury in horticulture of singular emolument to science The history of antient gardens hitherto not sufficiently illustrated merits the investigation of the most learned and able writer of the pen of a RAPIN a MEURSIUS a SEGUIER or a GRONOVIUS We learn however that even  Botanical  gardens are of antient date If it may be credited what is related of ATTALUS the last king of  Pergamus  who from his love of physic has been stiled the physician he collected in his garden  hellebore henbane aconite  and other poisonous herbs to make experiments on criminals with counterpoisons  Crete  from  the earliest times renowned for the production of medicinal herbs was the physicgarden of  Rome  The Emperors we are told maintained in that island herbarists and gardeners to provide the physicians of  Rome  with simples  Castor  a Greek praised both by PLINY and GALEN is said not only to have written many volumes concerning plants but to have had a garden at  Rome  in which PLINY relates that CASTOR at upwards of an hundred years of age demonstrated plants and taught him to distinguish several rare and useful species  The utility of these institutions are selfevident By public gardens medicinal plants are at the command of the teacher in every lesson By private ones the eye and the taste of the opulent and scientific owner is perpetually gratified with the succession of curious scarce and exotic luxuries in comparing the doubtful species and examining them through all the stages of growth with those to which they are allied Add to which that all these advantages are accumulated in a thousand objects  at the same time The first public institution of this kind in more modern times was that of  Padua  by the Venetians in the year LUCAS GHINUS the first public professor of Botany in  Europe  was a strenuous promoter of the same designs and by his influence procured the establishment of a garden at  Bologna  in where TURNER himself imbibed much of that knowledge which afterwards gave him such preeminence in his own country  Among the earliest private gardens of the same kind was that of EURICIUS CORDUS the disciple of the venerable LEONICENUS and of MANARDUS two of the first commentators who displayed true Botanical criticism on the works of the antients CORDUS shewed himself afterwards worthy of such masters In his  Botanologicon  printed in he mentions his own garden and that of NORDECIUS at  Cassel  About the same time there were several opulent patrons of this science in  Italy Germany  and  France  who followed this example GESNER constructed a garden at  Zurich  in  the first of the kind in  Switzerland  He not only delineated plants himself but maintained at his own expence a draughtsman and engraver for the same purposes TURNER appears to have had a garden for rare plants even during his residence at  Cologn  In  England  he records the garden of the duke of  Somerset  at  Sion House  of which he seems to have had the direction and at a later period as hath been before observed mentions also his own at  Wells  CHAP  Turner  Anecdotes of his lifeAccount of his writings preceding the  Herbal  His  Herbal  the first original book of Botany published in  England  An account of that workContemporary Botanists mentioned by  TURNER  as  Falconer Wooton Merdy ClementTurner  's book on baths  Turner  not sufficiently appreciated by succeeding Botanists  TURNER  THE history of English Botany to this period from its imperfect and even barbarous state may perhaps not unaptly be considered as the fabulous age of the science among us But we are now arrived at the true Era of its birth in  England  I cannot call it the restoration since this nation like  Italy  in the flourishing state of  Rome  had never been enlightened by the writings of  Greece  It was much later before the works of those sages reached this kingdom Manuscript copies of the PATRES BOTANICI as hath been before observed  were exceedingly rare and the language itself in which they are written had made small progress in  England  On this head indeed my sources of information are very narrow as far as they reach I am not able to find that one manuscript of THEOPHRASTUS existed at this period in any of the public libraries of  England  Of DIOSCORIDES there are two MSS in the  Bodleian  N  o  which bear the title of "  De Herbarum Natura et Virtutibus cum Iconibus elegantibus  " And in the same collection N  o  an Arabic version of the five books  cum Nominibus à Thoma Hyde adjectis  Of PLINY there is said to be an entire copy in  Baliol  library N  o  an imperfect one of eighteen books only in the  Norfolk  collection N  o  and an epitome in Trinitycollege  Cambridge  N  o    Even of the works of HIPPOCRATES scarcely any were known except his  Aphorisms  and  Prognostics  and  Linacre  first made the English physicians acquainted with GALEN But to return the true Era of Botany in  England  must commence  with Dr  William  TURNER who was unquestionably the earliest writer among us that discovered learning and critical judgment in the knowledge of plants and whose "Book of Herbs" as Dr BULLEYN observes  "will always grow green and never wither as long as  Dioscorides  is held in mind by us mortal wights"  But before I turn my attention to TURNER I will remark that in an interval of thirtyfour years between the first edition of "The Grete Herbal" in and that of TURNER in I have it not in my power to refer to any publication on my subject in the English tongue That there were translations of several of the writers of the middle ages has been noticed Among those on the continent there were several by whose means Botany made a rapid progress The principal were BRUNSFELSIUS EURICIUS CORDUS RUELLIUS  Valerius  CORDUS FUCHSIUS and above all GESNER who possessing a genius and industry almost unparalleled in these studies comprehended this rising branch of knowledge with a more expanded view than any of his  predecessors and extended its bounds beyond the limits which till that time  Materia Medica  alone had prescribed to it But GESNER's talents though in Botany they were original were still more conspicuous in his knowledge of the animal kingdom in which his writings will long be valued and esteemed by those especially who without painful researches would see antient literature in a concentrated view I speak not of his abilities as a philologist and critic in which characters he held a distinguished place But to proceed  WILLIAM TURNER was born at  Morpeth  in  Northumberland  and educated at Pembroke college  Cambridge  under the patronage and assistance of  Sir Thomas Wentworth  I find him a student of that college about the year where he acquired great reputation for his learning He applied himself to philosophy and physic and early discovered an inclination to the study of plants and a wish to be well acquainted with the  Materia Medica  of the antients  He complains of the little assistance he  could receive in these pursuits  "Being yet a student of Pembroke hall whereas I could learn never one Greke neither Latin nor English name even amongst the physicians of any herbe or tree such was the ignorance at that time and as yet there was no English Herbal but one all full of unlearned cacographies and falsely naming of herbes"  At  Cambridge  TURNER imbibed the principles of the reformers and afterwards agreeably to the practice of many others united to the character of the physician that of the divine He became a preacher travelling into many parts of  England  and propagated with so much zeal the cause of the reformation that he excited persecution from Bishop  Gardiner  He was thrown into prison and detained a considerable time On his enlargement he submitted to voluntary exile during the remainder of the reign of  Henry  VIII  This banishment proved favourable to his advancement in medical and botanical studies he resided at  Basil  at  Strasburgh  at  Bonn  but principally at  Cologn  with  many other English refugees He dwelt for some time at  Wiessenburgh  he travelled into  Italy  and took the degree of Doctor of Physic at  Ferrara  As at this period the learned were applying with great assiduity to the illustration of the antients it was a fortunate circumstance to Dr TURNER that he had an opportunity of attending the lectures of  Lucas  GHINUS at  Bologna  of whom he speaks in his "  Herbal  " with great satisfaction and frequently cites his authority against other commentators GHINUS was the first who erected a separate professorial chair for Botanical science from whence he gave lectures on DIOSCORIDES which he continued for twentyeight years with great applause He procured the physicgarden to be founded at  Bologna  to demonstrate the plants he spoke of He was the preceptor of CAESALPINUS and ANGUILLARA who became two of the soundest critics in the knowledge of plants that the age produced TURNER resided a considerable time at  Basil  from which place he dates the dedication of his book "On the Baths of  England  and  Germany  " During his residence in  Switzerland  he contracted a friendship with GESNER and afterwards kept up a correspondence with him  GESNER had a high opinion of TURNER as appears by the following passage in his book  De Herbis Lunariis  printed in  "  Ante annos    aut circiter cum Anglicus ex Italia rediens me salutaret  TURNERUS  is suerit vir excellentis tum in re medica tum aliis plerisque disciplinis doctrinae aut alius quispiam vix satis memini c  "  At the accession of  Edward  VI he returned to  England  was incorporated Doctor of Physic at  Oxford  appointed Physician to  Edward  Duke of  Somerset  and as a divine was rewarded with a Prebend of  York  a Canonry of  Windsor  and the Deanery of  Wells  He speaks of himself in the third part of his Herbal when treating on the  herba Britannica  which he took to be the Bistort as having been physician to the "Erle of  Embden  Lord of  East Friesland  " In he published the first part of his history of plants which he dedicated  to the duke his patron His zeal in the cause of the reformation which he had amply testified by several religious tracts induced him to retreat to the continent during the whole reign of  Mary  At her decease Queen ELIZABETH reinstated him in all his church preferments In the dedication of the compleat edition of his "Herbal" to the queen in after complimenting her majesty on account of her skill in the Latin language and the fluency with which she conversed in it he acknowledges with gratitude her favours in restoring him to his benefices and in other ways protecting him from troubles having at four several times granted him the great seal for these purposes He seems to have divided his time between his deanery where he had a Botanical garden of which frequent mention is made in his "Herbal" and his house in Crutched Friers  London  He also speaks of his garden at  Kew  From the repeated notices he takes of the plants in  Purbeck  and about  Portland  I should suppose he must have had some intimate connections in  Dorsetshire  Dr TURNER died July a few months after the publication of the last part of his "Herbal" He left several children his son  Peter  was educated to physic travelled and took degrees abroad was incorporated doctor at  Cambridge  and at  Oxford  and died aged in but I do not find that he inherited his father's turn to Botany  TURNER's first work on the subject of plants if BUMALDUS is not mistaken was printed at  Cologn  under the title of "  Historia de Naturis Herbarum Scholiis et Notis vallata  "  Colon  apud Gymnicum  o    Bumaldus  is the only writer in whom I find any mention of this book and I suspect it was not republished in  England  It was followed by a small volume under the title of "NAMES OF HERBES in Greek Latin English Dutch and French"  Lond    o  This nomenclator is I believe become very scarce since it has not yet found its way into the copious and magnificent collection of Sir  Joseph  BANKS  Dr TURNER's knowledge in natural history was not confined to Botany his earliest  publication appears to have been a treatise on birds under the following title  "  Avium praecipuarum quarum apud Plinium et Aristotelem mentio est brevis et succinct a historia ex optimis quibusque scriptoribus contexta Scholio illustrata et aucta Adjectis nominibus Graecis Germanicis et Britannicis  " Coloniae  o  Not having seen this volume I can only say that TURNER is mentioned by his friend GESNER in respectful terms as an ornithologist  "  Avium quidem nomina et naturas ante nos et pauci et breviter attigerunt ex quibus Gyb Longolius Germanus et Gulielmus  TURNER  Anglus viri doctissimi praecipuam merentur laudem  "  Gesn Praef ad Avium Hist  TURNER also contributed to enrich GESNER's museum the first collection of that kind with natural curiosities which he sent from  England  To which I add that Dr MERRET gives the following testimony to the worth of TURNER in the Preface to his "Pinax"  "  Consului in quibusdam  TURNERUM  nostratem inter viros suae aetatis exercitatissimum qui librum de avibus edidit mole parvum at judicio majorem  "  Prefixed to the third volume of the  Frankfort  edition of GESNER's  Historia Animalium  in we find a letter from Dr TURNER relating to the English fishes which sufficiently proves that he had no inconsiderable degree of knowledge in that part of zoology He makes an apology for the imperfections of it as being written from memory and at a distance from all his notes and observations It consists of three pages in which he has briefly described more than fifty species and it seems to be intended principally to give GESNER information on the English names which TURNER has carefully noted and often added the provincial appellations He takes in both sea and river fish and includes also the scallop and the cockle This letter was written from  Weissenburgh  and is dated Nov He undoubtedly pursued this branch of zoology much farther since it appears from his dedication to the queen that he intended  "to set out a book of the names and natures of the fishes of her majesty's realms"  But the work which secured his reputation to posterity and entitled him to the  character of an original writer on that subject in  England  is his "History of Plants" printed at different times in three parts in folio with cuts The first at  London  in under this title "A NEW HERBALL wherein are contayned the names of herbes in Greeke Latin English Duch Frenche and in the Potecaries and Herbaries Latin with the properties degrees and natural places of the same gathered For Steven Mierdman"  Lond  The second part at  Cologn  during his exile in the reign of  Mary  With this was reprinted the first part and his "Book on the Bathes of  England  and  Germany  "  In these were reprinted with the addition of the third part which bears the following title "The third part of W  m  TURNER's HERBAL wherein are contained the herbes rootes and fruytes whereof is no mention made of  Dioscorides Galene Plinye  and other old authors Imprinted at  Collen  by Arnold Birckman in the year of our Lord " The dedication however to the company of surgeons is dated from  Wells  June  Dr TURNER's "Herbal" is printed in the black letter agreeably to the general usage of the times and is embellished with the figures of most of the plants he describes  The arrangement is alphabetical according to the Latin names and after the description he frequently specifies the places of growth He is ample in his discrimination of the species as his great object was to ascertain the  Materia Medica  of the ancients and of DIOSCORIDES in particular throughout the vegetable kingdom To this end he bestows much criticism on the commentaries of FUCHSIUS TRAGUS MATTHIOLUS and other of his contemporaries and professes to have corrected many of their mistakes in the application of the names of DIOSCORIDES In all this he has shewn much judgment and I may add much moderation in avoiding more than usual the licence taken by many of the commentators of applying the names of plants described in THEOPHRASTUS DIOSCORIDES and PLINY to those of the western parts of  Europe  What he says of the virtues of  plants he has drawn from the ancients but has in numberless instances given his opinion of their qualities in opposition to those sages and recorded his own experience of the virtues He no where takes any doubtful plants upon trust but appears to have examined them with all the precision usually exercised at a time when method and principles now established were unthought of every where comparing them with the descriptions of the antients and moderns He first gave names to many English plants and allowing for the time when specifical distinctions were not established when almost all the small plants were disregarded and the  Cryptogamia  almost wholly overlooked the number he was acquainted with is much beyond what could easily have been imagined in an original writer on his subject  The third part of his "Herbal" dated from  Welles  June he dedicates to the company of surgeons and apologizes for its imperfections  "Being so much vexed with sickness and occupied with preaching and the study of divinity and  exercise of discipline I have had but small leisure to write Herballes"  In this part he professes to treat on the plants not known to DIOSCORIDES and the antients It consists of near an hundred articles among which we find introduced many of the exotic subjects which had before been but little known such as  cassia fistula cubebs guaiacum nutmegs myrobalans nux indica nux vomica anacardium rhubarb sarsaparilla senna  and  tamarinds  For these many new figures were cut which are executed in a stile superior to the others The remainder are principally the productions of our own country  The compleat edition of TURNER's "Herbal" in was printed at  Cologn  unquestionably to receive the advantage of the figures probably at that time the property of  Birkman  the printer They are the same with which the octavo edition of FUCHSIUS was first printed in in all five hundred and twelve Of these TURNER has used upwards of four hundred to which he has added about ninety new making the whole number five hundred and two  There are some instances of the wrong application of these figures an error that might readily happen when the author was at such a distance and was common in almost all similar works of that time There are also several figures to which no description of the plants can be found for instance the six figures of the  Geraniums  from FUCHSIUS occur with a slight mention of only two species in the text  TURNER is the first author who has given a figure of the Lucern which I apprehend he first brought into  England  and named  Horned Clover  He treats largely of its cultivation from PLINY PALLADIUS and COLUMELLA  In the dedication to the first edition of his "Herbal" in Dr TURNER speaks in very respectful terms of the botanical knowledge of several of his contemporaries and apologizes for his undertaking so arduous a matter while there were learned Englishmen better qualified He enumerates Dr CLEMENT Dr MERDY  Owen  WOOTON and Master FALCONER  The lastmentioned is several times introduced in the body of the work I can scarcely doubt that he was  John  FALCONER who is recorded as having communicated many English plants to AMATUS LUSITANUS who taught physic at  Ferrara  and  Ancona  and made himself known as a commentator on DIOSCORIDES in In treating on the  Glaux  of which TURNER gives a new figure he says  "He never saw it in  England  except in Master  Falconer  's book and that he brought it from  Italy  "  From this and other like citations it may reasonably be conjectured that "  Falconer  's Book" was an  Hortus Siccus  and if so must have been among the earliest collections of that kind that is noticed in  England  In appreciating the merit of Dr TURNER as a Botanist due regard must be had to the time in which he lived the little assistance he could derive from his contemporaries of whom BRUNSFELSIUS RUELLIUS FUCHSIUS and TRAGUS when he published his first part of the "Herbal" were the chief in which view he will appear  to have exhibited uncommon diligence and great erudition and fully to deserve the character of an original writer  Our author paid early attention to mineral waters He was probably the first who wrote on the baths of  Bath  in  Somersetshire  He visited several of the mineral springs in  Germany Switzerland  and  Italy  and drew up whilst abroad a short account of ten of those waters to which he prefixed a more enlarged history of the waters of  Bath  This was written as it should seem at  Basil  and is dedicated to his  "wellbeloved neighbours of  Bath Bristow Wells Winsam  and  Charde  "  March He adjudged the principle of Bath water to be brimstone and possibly a little copper from the vicinity of that metal in the neighbouring mountains He says he had been insormed that besides brimstone the King's bath held alum and the Cross bath saltpetre but that he could find neither He concludes his account of the baths by a set of general rules for all who drink mineral waters many of which do him no discredit  when compared with the injunctions of modern physicians  Our author also wrote "On the Nature of Wines commonly used in  England  " in vindication of the use of Rhenish wines To this was annexed a tract "On the Nature and Vertue of Treacle" But as I never saw these treatises I can give no account of them  Dr TURNER was the author of many polemical and religious treatises chiefly written in defence of the Reformation Of these a list is given in the  Athenae Oxonienses  and a more accurate and enlarged one in Bishop TANNER's  Bibliotheca  Several of his tracts are yet in manuscript in various libraries He collated the translation of the Bible with Hebrew Greek and Latin copies and corrected it in many places  He procured to be printed at  Antwerp  a new and corrected edition of the  Historia Gentis nostrae  s  Angliae  written by  William of Newburgh  from a manuscript he found in the library of  Wells  but complains that the printer not only omitted to insert certain  articles sent by him but left out the preface he sent him substituting one of his own Our author also translated several works from the Latin particularly "The Comparison of the Old Learning and the New" written by  Urbanus Regius  Southwark  o  and again and  I will not conclude this short memoir of Dr TURNER without remarking that the succeeding Herbalists GERARD JOHNSON and PARKINSON seem not to have paid due honour to his merit and learning from the silence they observe relating to him in their writings GERARD indeed mentions in his Preface  "that excellent work of master Dr TURNER"  and in another place stiles him  "that excellent painefull and diligent physition Mr Dr TURNER of late memorie"  In justice to TURNER they should have noticed all the plants he has recorded particularly the natives of  England  RAY at the distance of near a century was sensible of his worth having stiled  him  "a man of solid erudition and judgment  In honour of TURNER his name has been annexed by  Plumier  the French Botanist to a new genus of plants well known at this time in the English gardens It was first discovered by SLOANE in  Jamaica  and described by him under the title of  Cistus Urticae solio  "  CHAP  Dr  Bulleyn  Anecdotes of his lifeHis Herbal or Book on SimplesHis Defence of the Fertility of  England  Dr  Thomas Penny  Short Anecdotes ofThe friend and correspondent of  Gesner Clusius  and  Camerarius  MapletMorning  BULLEYN  COntemporary with TURNER lived Dr  William  BULLEYN Although this writer does not come strictly within my plan yet as he lived at a period barren of interesting materials and as we learn from him several curious anecdotes respecting natural history and the state of gardening in England at that period he cannot be passed over in silence  Bishop TANNER briefly notices Dr BULLEYN and his writings but his life is amply written in the  Biographia Britannica  to which I must principally be indebted for my information  He was born in the Isle of  Ely  in the early part of  Henry  the Eighth's reign and was educated at  Cambridge  though as  Wood  says he afterwards resided some time at  Oxford  It appears that he had travelled over several parts of  Germany  that he visited  Scotland  and had taken many tours in his native country in all which he studied the natural productions with a zeal and success not common in that age In an early period of his life he was much conversant about the city os  Norwich  In June he was instituted to the rectory of  Blaxhall  in  Suffolk  where his relations resided This preferment he resigned in Where he took the degree of doctor in physic is not ascertained but from his prior attachment to physic his known opposition to the doctrine of Transubstantiation and the resignation of his living in the beginning of  Mary  's reign it may be fairly conjectured that he did not take his degrees in that faculty till after that period and probably abroad Aster this we find him removed to the city of  Durham  where he practised physic and became possessed of  property in the saltpans near  Tinmouth Castle  On the death of his patron Sir Thomas  Hilton  he removed to  London  where he became a member of the college of physicians and acquired reputation as a physician and a man of learning This event took place about the year He had the misfortune to lose great part of his library with his manuscript upon "Healthfull Medicines" by shipwreck and after this disaster met with most unjust and malevolent treatment from a brother of Sir Thomas  Hilton  by whom he was accused of having murdered his late patron who died in fact of a malignant fever And although his innocence was fully manifested yet his enemy persisting further in his persecution found means to throw him into prison for debt where he wrote a great part of his medical treatises He died Jan He appears to have been much attached to the principles of the reformation Bishop TANNER says he was a man of acute judgment and true piety  I am not acquainted with any print of Dr TURNER Of Dr BULLEYN there is  a profile with a long beard before his "Government of Health" and a whole length of him in wood prefixed to the "Bulwarke of Defence" which book is a collection of most of his works He was an ancestor of the late Dr STUKELY who in was at the expence of having a small head of him engraved  The part of his works which has the nearest connection with my subject is in his "Bulwark of Defence" in fol  It is entitled "A Book of Simples being an HERBAL in the form of a dialogue at the end of which are the cuts of some plants in wood" In this piece he observes that  tormentil  in pastures prevents the rot in sheep and adds that the fact was confirmed by the shepherds in sundry parts of Norfolk In his enumeration of the virtues of simples from other authors he does not fail to record his own experience on the power of several in removing severe diseases Of the effects of Dittander  calamus aromaticus  the Daisy and others he adduces particular instances It were to be wished that succeeding observations  had confirmed his representation His travels and the great attention he had paid to the native productions of his own country had given him a comprehensive view of the natural fertility of the soil and climate of  England  which from the tenour of his writings seems to have been at that time by some people much depreciated He opposes this idea with patriotic zeal and concern and alleges various examples to prove that we had excellent apples pears plums cherries and hops of our own growth before the importation of these articles into  England  by the  London  and  Kentish  gardeners but that the culture of them had been greatly neglected He endeavours to confirm the natural fertility of the land from the memorable instance of the  sea pease  on the beach near  Orford  and  Aldborough  by an immense crop of which the poor were preserved in a time of dearth in the year Of which see further accounts in  Johnson  's GERARD p PARKINSON's "  Theatre  " p and LOBEL's  Illustrationes  p  To conclude Dr Bulleyn's specific knowledge of Botany seems to have been but slender His zeal for the promotion of the useful arts of gardening the general culture of the land and the commercial interests of the kingdom deserved the highest praise and for the information he has left of these affairs in his own time posterity owe him acknowledgments  Although the progress of gardening does not enter into my plan yet I am tempted in this place to remark that notwithstanding culinary herbs and roots and many fruits are said to have been imported in the reign of HENRY  the Eighth  from  Holland  and  France  and that the true aera of improvement in this art cannot be carried at the most remote time beyond the same reign yet it may justly be doubted whether it was then in so low a state as hath been usually represented With other arts in its progression westwards that of Horticulture must be supposed to have reached the  Low Countries  and  France  before  England  and a general and prior superiority to our neighbours may be granted and that a  fashion and a too great fondness for rarities of foreign growth might influence the London market of which the spirit of commerce would not fail to take advantage must likewise be admitted But to the arguments and proofs alledged by  Dr  BULLEYN in defence of the fertility of his native soil and the perfection of our own products and as a proof of the successful cultivation of those times I add that from an inspection of our old Herbals and particularly of PARKINSON's  Paradisus  we find the various species of culinary herbs roots and of fruits multiplied in  England  to such a variety as implies a preceding course of culture carried on for a series of time inconsistent with that poverty of produce which hath been surmised  PENNY  Having introduced to the reader the two first respectable writers on Botany in  England  I cannot but regret my want of sufficient information to rescue from an almost total obscurity the name of Dr  Thomas  PENNY an Englishman of the same age who although not an author himself was indubitably a man of great attainments in the natural history and especially in the Botany of his time GERARD stiles him  "A second  Dioscorides  for his singular knowledge in plants"  I cannot ascertain the date of his birth It appears that he was a fellow of the royal college of physicians and that he had travelled into various parts of  Europe  He had resided in  Switzerland  and had visited if not made some stay in the island of  Majorca  That he had diligently searched both the northern and southern parts of  England  is manifest from the variety of rare plants discovered by him and communicated to LOBEL and GERARD He was personally known to GESNER and CAMERARIUS and afterwards frequently supplied them with rare plants for their respective  Herbaria  and gardens  During his residence in  Switzerland  he collected many plants of that country and from the confines of  France  He assisted GESNER as appears by his observations  and animadversions on that author's tables published by SCHMIEDEL from the collections of TREW in in which the most honourable testimony is given to his abilities I suspect he was in  Switzerland  at the time of GESNER's death and assisted WOLF in arranging the plants and memorials of their deceased friend  There can be no doubt that PENNY and CLUSIUS were also personally acquainted They appear to have had a strict intimacy and the latter was obliged to PENNY for a variety of curious articles inserted in his  Rariores  and in the  Exoticae  Dr PENNY brought from  Majorca  the  hypericum balearicum  which CLUSIUS named  myrtocistus  PENNAEI after him as he did a gentian now the  swertia perennis  The same of the  geranium tuberosum  The  cornus herbacea  that beautiful native of the  Cheviot  hills was first revealed to the curious by this industrious naturalist  Dr PENNY's acquirements in natural history extended beyond the knowledge of plants He is one of the first Englishmen whom I have met with who had studied  insects There are letters witten by him to CAMERARIUS in the year preserved in TREW's collections which prove his knowledge in  entomology  to have been extensive in that day and it is supposed by SCHMIEDEL that GESNER's drawings of  Papilio  's passed into the hands of PENNY This supposition is rendered more probable when it is recollected that the  Theatrum Insectorum  of MOUFET was a work begun by  Dr Edward  WOOTON  Conraae  GESNER and Dr PENNY and received only the finishing hand from MOUFET  Dr PENNY died in and is said by JUNGERMAN to have left his papers to MOUFET and TURNER but in this account there is surely a very striking anachronism since TURNER himself died in the year  MAPLET  John  MAPLET master of arts of  Cambridge  published in the year "A GREEN FOREST or Natural History wherein may be seen the soveraign  vertues of all kinds of stones and metals  herbs trees  beasts fouls and fishes leaves  o  " I have not seen  Maplet  's book but from the title of another work of his "The Dial of Destinie or Influence of the Seven Planets over all Kinds of Creatures here below" published in it may fairly be presumed that he was deep in the fancies of the astrologic sect  MORNING  Between the publication of TURNER's Herbal and that of LYTE I find a book of which not having seen it or been able to refer to any account I can only recite the title "The Treasure of Euonymus by  Peter  MORNING with wooden cuts Imprinted by John Day"  o    CHAP  Lyte  Anecdotes ofNot an original writer in BotanyHis Herbal a translation from  Clusius  's version of  Dodoens  Small accession made to  English  Botany by this work  LYTE  HENRY  LYTE  Esq  of an ancient family at  LytesCarey  in  Somersetshire  was the next after TURNER who published an  English Herbal  He was born in and became a student at  Oxford  in the latter end of  Henry  VIII about the year He afterwards travelled and at length retired to his patrimony where as  Wood  says  "by the advantage of a good foundation of literature made in the university and abroad he became a most excellent scholar in several sorts of learning"  He was the author of various publications of the historical kind which are enumerated in the  Athenae Oxonienses  He died at the age of  and was buried at  CharltonMackerel  in the same county He left a son who drew up a genealogy of  James  I for which the king rewarded him with his picture in gold set with diamonds and the prince afterwards  Charles  I gave him also his picture in gold  Although Mr LYTE does not rank among original writers in Botany his work nevertheless seems to have been well received Even the arrangement alone would instantly give it a great advantage over  Turner  's book It is professedly a translation from the French version of the Dutch Herbal of DODOENS written by the author in and translated by  Clusius  in being the first of his publications Of DODOENS it will be necessary to give some account but I shall defer it till I speak of GERARD as the improved editions of DODOENS's book were the basis of that author's work  The first edition of LYTE's Herbal was published at  Antwerp  It is printed in the black letter and bears the following title  "A NIEWE HERBALL or HISTORIE OF  PLANTES wherein is contayned the whole discourse and perfect description of all sorts of herbs and plantes their divers and sundry kindes their straunge figures fashions and shapes their names natures and operations and vertues and that not only of those which are here growyng in this our countrie of Englande but of all others also of forayne realmes commonly used in physicke First set forth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue by that learned D  Rembert  DODOENS physition to the emperor and now first translated by "  Henry  LYTE  Esquyer  At London by me  Gerard Dewes  "The Colophon "imprinted at  Antwerpe  by me  Henry Loe  bookprinter" pp  Mr LYTE dedicates his work to queen  Elizabeth  and has prefixed the preface and appendix in Latin from DODOENS or DODONAEUS The latter of these is a collection from DIOSCORIDES and CATO but chiefly from PLINY relating to the rise and progress of botanical and agricultural  knowledge among the Romans and in commendation of gardens with rules for laying them out and managing them to advantage  He has followed his original in dividing his subjects into six books and although the general arrangement is confused LYTE has the merit of having introduced a particular order in each chapter or genus much superior to that of TURNER having divided the species description place time names nature and virtues under these several titles into distinct sections This arrangement was adopted by GERARD and PARKINSON  LYTE describes one thousand and fifty species of which eight hundred and seventy are figured The blocks are I believe the same with which CLUSIUS's own translation was printed being as far as those extend copies from the octavo edition of FUCHSIUS Most of TURNER's figures are found in LYTE The remainder are such as had been cut for the subsequent works of DODOENS and afterwards embellished the  Pemptades  of that author and GERARD's  history The English translator added about thirty new ones Among these several are in a style superior to those of CLUSIUS and GERARD such are particularly the  Salvia Aethiops  the  Stratiotes aloides  the  Rha  or  Centaurea Rhaponticum  and others  Some are original I cite only the  Erica Tetralix  of which I find no figure prior to  Lyte  's that of GERARD or which is the same of  Clusius  applied to it by JOHNSON being certainly intended to represent another species and is accordingly referred to the  Mediterranea  by LINNAEUS  The first edition of  Lyte  is adorned with a finelycut impression in wood of DODOENS in the thirtyfifth year of his age and a large engraving of Mr  Lyte  's coat of arms  This first edition was undoubtedly printed at  Antwerp  to receive the advantage of the figures The subsequent editions therefore afterwards printed in  England  are without figures It was reprinted as  Ames  informs us in and in and according to  Wood  by  Ninion Newton  at  London  in in quarto also without  cuts I find editions mentioned with the dates and which if genuine and not in the titlepage only is a proof of its popularity and that it was not superseded by the larger work of GERARD in SEGUIER even quotes one so late as the year  As in the interval between the publication of CLUSIUS's French translation in and the English version of it by LYTE in the author had at different times compleated the several parts of his  Historiae Plantarum  it may be presumed that LYTE profited by those works From some of the commendatory verses prefixed it should seem that  Dodoens  himself communicated additions to LYTE As I have not had an opportunity of comparing the French version of  Clusius  with LYTE I cannot notice the nature of his alterations or the extent of his additions The introduction of the English names was a necessary augmentation  In the mean time there seems to be no ground for the criticism of THRELKELD who accuses LYTE of having omitted the  Purgantium Historia  of DODONAEUS of which LYTE appears unquestionably to have introduced the most material subjects  English Botany however received little or no accession from LYTE himself It is not in more than about twenty instances that he has even pointed out the local situation of any rare English plants and in these instances there is scarcely one which had not been thus  specifically  recorded by TURNER and LOBEL before him  Hence I am not able to give LYTE the credit although he lived at so early a period of being the first discoverer of a single species of rare growth Yet as it is but justice to suppose him well acquainted with all the common plants so a large number of these which had been unnoticed by TURNER or are not easily ascertained in his work will be found first announced to the English Botanist in LYTE I confess however that it is extremely difficult to determine in a variety of instances whether the general places of growth as mentioned in this author are inserted from his own knowledge or whether they stand as  translated by him from CLUSIUS It is this doubt that has induced me not unfrequently to ascribe to GERARD or JOHNSON the first knowledge of many common plants certainly ascertained by them that occur nevertheless in LYTE's work  This author furnishes very few observations which tend to illustrate the state of the science between the time of TURNER and his own Nor does he mention in more than one or two instances any of his contemporaries Under the article  Verbascum  he speaks of  "the pleasant garden of  James Champaigne  the deer friende and lover of plantes"  but without any information of his character or place of abode And under that of  Sweet Trefoil  "the garden of maister Rich"  CHAP  Lobel  Anecdotes ofOf  Flemish  extraction but lived chiefly in  England  Travelled with  Lord Zouch  Entitled Botanist

Botany that he justly claims attention in the object of this work LOBEL was of Flemish extraction and was born in at  Lisle  where his father was in the profession of the law  He informs us that at the age of sixteen he was enamoured with the love of  plants and had an unconquerable desire to know the names and properties of those used in physic He studied at  Montpelier  under the famous RONDELETIUS During his residence there he travelled over the south of  France  in search of simples  At  Narbone  he formed a connection with  Peter  PENA who was jointly concerned with him in his first work the  Adversaria  On leaving  France  he extended his researches by travelling over  Switzerland  the county of  Tyrol  some parts of  Germany  and  Italy  and on his return settled as a physician at  Antwerp  and afterwards at  Delft  He was then made physician to  William  Prince of  Orange  and to the States of  Holland  On what occasion he removed into  England  or at what period of his life I cannot ascertain From the circumstance however of the  Adversaria  bearing date at  London  in it should seem to have been before that time which opinion is somewhat corroborated by his informing us that Dr TURNER had given him "long before" the seeds of the  sea kale  In  England  he obtained the patronage of  Lord Zouch  whom he attended in in his embassy to the court of  Denmark  This tour furnished him with further means of augmenting his knowledge in Botany and through the correspondence he formed there of introducing into  England  several exotic rarities before that time unknown to this country He had the superintendance of a garden at  Hackney  which he calls a physicgarden cultivated at the expence of his patron He was afterwards stiled Botanist to King  James  as appears by the  imprimatur  to the second edition of the  Adversaria  and by his own letter prefixed to GERARD's "Herbal" Whether any emolument was annexed to this title I am unable to decide He had a daughter married to a Mr  James  COEL who lived at  Highgate  near  London  and it is probable from the very frequent mention that LOBEL makes of that place in his last work the  Illustrationes  that he resided in the latter years of his life with his soninlaw  He died in aged There was a print of LOBEL but it is very scarce I have  only seen it in the collection of the late Mr  Gulston  The first of LOBEL's publications and which more eminently agrees with the design of this work as it brought a large accession to English Botany was the  Stirpium Adversaria  The professed intention of this work was to investigate the Botany and  materia medica  of the antients and particularly of DIOSCORIDES and LOBEL is judged to have corrected the errors of MATTHIOLUS upon that author in many instances  As PENA was jointly concerned with LOBEL in this work it is become impossible at this time to assign to each their separate share The first edition of the  Adversaria  dated at  London  was dedicated to the queen This dedication was omitted in an edition printed at  Antwerp  in Editions bearing date are recorded but it may be doubted whether these were more than titlepage alterations To that of the whole  Adversaria  which bears date London by  Purfoot  also is prefixed LOBEL's  Animadversiones  in Rondeletii methodicam Pharmaceuticam officinam  containing pages After this the title and a dedication to the professors at  Montpelier  printed by  Purfoot  but the succeeding first part of the  Adversaria  is on a much better paper and in a finer type and evidently printed by  Plantin  as far as to page to which succeeds one leaf added in  Purfoot  's type containing the account of the  Plocamos  of  Portland  and of the  Barnacle  the fabulous history of which he relates without wholly denying it Then follows the pages being continued the second part of the  Adversaria  now first printed by the  London  printer To which is annexed LOBEL's "Tract on the Balsams Cinnamon Cassia" and various other matters with a small treatise on the dropsy and the  elephantiasis  written by his much reverenced master RONDELETIUS  The second edition bears the following title "

Reprinted at Frankfort in  In the execution of this work there is exhibited I believe the first sketch rude as it is of a natural method of arrangement which however extends no farther than throwing the plants into large tribes families or orders according to the external appearance or habit of the whole plant or flower without establishing any definitions or characters The whole forms fortyfour tribes Some contain  the plants of one or two modern  genera  others many and some it must be confessed very incongruous to each other On the whole they are much superior to DODOENS's divisions and sufficiently testify that the author was sensible of the want of a better arrangement than the mere alphabetic order or that formed from the supposed qualities and uses in medicine  At the head of each tribe or family he prefixes a synoptical view of all the species to be described under it His method then is to give the  Greek  and  Latin  name and wherever he can the name of the genus and species in  German Dutch French  and  English  Then the description of the plant the time of flowering the country in which it grows spontaneously and in  England  he points out the particular spot where some of the more rare are found Mr RAY however has remarked that in this respect LOBEL has been inaccurate or trusted too much to his memory since many have been sought for in vain in the situations he specified Frequent reference is made in the margin to the figures in  FUCHSIUS MATTHIOLUS DODONAEUS as far as p after which this assistance is wanting LOBEL's own figures are small and insufficient in many cases to express the habit of the plant the delineation of which was almost the extent of the efforts of those days  LOBEL having carefully studied the antients on the  Materia Medica  having travelled much and seen plants in various countries was enabled to exercise critical skill and to detect numerous errors in the dispensation of simples which he does not fail to point out His strong attachment to the study interested him powerfully in the investigation of new plants and enabled him to make large accessions to knowledge He travelled over various parts of  England  and discovered many vegetables before unnoticed He added to the  grasses  a number of new species and although his stile is universally condemned as harsh and incorrect and his descriptions frequently obscure and insufficient the  Adversaria  has on the whole great merit abounding with much curious intelligence and some new discoveries  The second part of the  Adversaria  is but a small part of the whole It presents us with a list of one hundred and thirty species of grasses known to the author this is followed by the figures and descriptions of some new and rare kinds of the same tribe A number of new plants of the liliaceous and bulbousrooted order a copious account with a figure of the  yucca  lately introduced concluding with a catalogue from CLUSIUS of thirtyeight varieties of  Anemone  a proof of the flourishing state of the Florist's art in the beginning of the last century at which time it is certain from LOBEL's book that many people were very assiduous in the cultivation of exotics  In LOBEL published a book well known and much quoted since by the name of "OBSERVATIONES  sive Stirpium Historiae cui annexum est Adversariorum Volumen In fol cum Iconibus  "  By the assistance of  Plantin  this volume was accompanied with figures which had been cut for the works of CLUSIUS MATTHIOLUS and DODONAEUS  In it was translated into Dutch together  with the  Adversaria  and the figures augmented to the number of The same year the  icons  were separately cast off on paper of the oblong form the figures amounting to Some of these impressions were accompanied with an index in seven languages which rendered it a very popular book for many years It preserves some value to this day as being the edition that LINNAEUS quotes throughout his works  LOBEL had meditated a very large work which was to have borne the title of "ILLUSTRATIONES PLANTARUM" but he lived not to finish it Some of his papers fell into the hands of PARKINSON and were incorporated into his  Theatrum  A fragment of the abovementioned work was published by Dr How in which contains the descriptions of many grasses and other plants newly discovered or lately introduced Of the grasses many here recorded were first discovered by LOBEL The preface contains some severe censures on GERARD and reflexions on the treatment LOBEL had received from booksellers all  written in a stile very reprehensible in a man of letters He may be justly accused of uncandid and disingenuous conduct towards GERARD whom while living he had treated with the appearance of friendship and esteem and of whose abilities and zeal he had spoken in the highest terms as is manifest in various parts of the  Adversaria  in the attestation to the catalogue of GERARD's Garden and by the recommendatory letter prefixed to his Herbal  I regret that I am not able to do more than barely enumerate the following persons who were zealous promoters of gardening and botanical knowledge in the time of LOBEL and liberal in their communications to him  Dr  James  CARGIL of  Aberdeen  of whom however some brief mention will be made hereafter  Edward  SAINTLOO  Esq  of  Somersetshire  whom he speaks of as much attached to studies of this kind  James  CO  I of Highgate soninlaw to LOBEL  J  NASMYTH surgeon to James the First  John De  FRANQUEVILLE a merchant in London a celebrated florist and a great lover of all rare plants as well as flowers from whose care as Parkinson says  "is sprung the greatest store that is now flourishing in this kingdom"  Hugh  MORGAN apothecary to queen  Elizabeth  of whose garden very frequent mention occurs in both parts of the  Adversaria  and also in GERARD's History afterwards who stiles him  "a curious conservator of simples"  William  COYS of  Stubbers  in the parish of  North Okington  in  Essex  possessed a garden which both LOBEL  The name of LOBEL was perpetuated by PLUMIER who gave it to a plant which is a native of both the Indies since denominated  Scaevola  But the Swede has preserved the name to a numerous set of plants of the  syngenesious  class among which rank the  cardinal  flowers and two English species  PLUMIER also commemorated PENA by giving his name to one of his new American plants which as it proved to be a species of  Polygala  was transferred by the author of the sexual system to an Ethiopian plant of the tetrandrous class though allied in habit to the  Ericae  and  Passerinae  and GERARD inform us was richly stored with exotics Under his care the  yucca  first flowered in  England  in the year  To these must be added the wellknown names of GERARD and PARKINSON  NEWTON  There is "an Herbal to the Bible" said to be written by  Thomas  NEWTON and printed in  o  This author after having practised physic became a divine and schoolmaster at  Ilford  in  Essex  where he died in His book I believe is only a translation of "LEVINI LEMNII  Explicatia Similitudinum quae in Bibliis ex herbis et arboribus sumuntur  " LEMNIUS who was a physician in the province of  Zealand  briefly describes the plants of the holy Scriptures and produces a number of curious philological observations respecting the uses of plants in ceremonial and sacred rites He also wrote a memorable work  De Miraculis occultis Naturae  The singular property  of madder in colouring red the bones of animals that are fed with it appears to have been known to  Lemnius  but whether he learnt it from  Mizaldus  or the latter from him I know not His book was among the earliest productions in its way and seems to have been well received as may be judged by its passing through twelve or thirteen editions from its first publication in to  I conceive this  Thomas  NEWTON to have been the writer of those commendatory lines prefixed to LYTE's  Herbal  in which after complimenting the author for his judicious selection of useful knowledge from former writers he has  versified  in less than two pages the names of more than two hundred worthies in medical science from the earliest antiquity to his own times  CHAP  Account of  Dodoens  and his  Pemptades  as introductory to the  Herbal  of  Gerard  Circumstances of the times favourable to  Gerard  Account of  Gerard  The catalogue of his gardenAccount of his  Herbal  a popular work for more than a centuryContemporary Botanists  HeskethGaret  the correspondent of  ClusiusLete  and others  GERARD  LOBEL's writings howsoever esteemed by the learned having never been translated into English could not become popular and at the conclusion of the sixteenth century TURNER's book was probably no less obsolete than LYTE's was imperfect These circumstances conspiring with the growing taste of the times for gardening it may be presumed incited GERARD to undertake his Herbal a work which maintained its credit and esteem for more than a century and pleasing as it is to reflect on the rapid progress and improvement of Botany within the last half century yet there are many now living who  can recollect that when they were young in science there was no better source of Botanical intelligence in the  English  tongue than the Herbals of GERARD and PARKINSON  It has been observed that the early edition of DODOENS's book as translated by CLUSIUS had been the basis of LYTE's Herbal and as the last edition of the same author became the foundation of GERARD's this circumstance renders it not unsuitable here to take some notice of an author although a foreigner to whom he owed so much of that credit which has preserved his memory to the present times  Rembert  DODOENS or DODONAEUS was born in near  Mechlin  in  Flanders  He became conspicuous for his various erudition when young was physician for some time to the Emperor  Maximilian  and his son  Rodolph  II The importunity of his friends procured his dismission from the Emperor's service and he settled at  Antwerp  was afterwards professor at  Leyden  and died in He wrote on astronomy geography and physic but is remembered  now principally by his botanical works His attachment to this study and the opportunities he enjoyed of gratifying it enabled him to turn it to the most advantageous purposes He began to publish in and continued his accessions and improvements to the year when he collected all his writings on this subject into one volume under the following title "STIRPIUM HISTORIAE PEMPTADES  Sex sive Libri  XXX  Ant ex officin Plant  "  in folio cum icon    pp  Each Pemptade is divided into five books  The st comprehends a number of dissimilar plants in alphabetic order  Flowergarden plants and the umbelliferous tribe  Medicinal roots purgative plants climbing and poisonous plants ferns mosses and fungi  Grain pulse grasses water and marsh plants  Edible plants gourd plants esculent roots oleraceous thistles and spinose plants  Shrubs and trees  It was reprinted in and with  some small additions and being translated also into Dutch with great enlargement became a popular book in that language  The judicious selection of all that was useful relating to the supposed plants of the  Materia Medica  of DIOSCORIDES and of the Arabians the introduction of all the new species from CLUSIUS and other discoveries of the time added to the instruction and embellishment derived from the figures which exceeded in number those of any preceding author rendered  Dodoens  's book useful to the medical profession throughout the world It still preserves some value as being referred to by LINNAEUS for the illustration of the European plants  As GERARD could not attempt an entire new work there was then extant no other to which he could give the preference as a basis to his design for as such only it must be considered since the interval of time between the publication of DODONAEUS's work in and the printing of his own "Herbal" had given him opportunities to intersperse large additions both in exotic and indigenous Botany In this interval  the science had been augmented and not less enriched by the writings of CAESALPINUS in by the  Epitomé  of CAMERARIUS in by the  Historia Lugdunensis  of DALECHAMP in by the  Sylva Harcynia  of THALIUS and especially by the  Historia  and  Icones  of TABERNAEMONTANUS in and  To these may be added a number of collateral resources which the growing commerce and spirit of the times rendered favourable to his purposes I will briefly mention the following the  Materia Medica  had for a series of years been perpetually augmenting by a variety of new drugs which were eagerly sought after the origin of which notwithstanding was in many instances obscure and in others as yet unknown At length the publication of GARCIAS  ab  HORTO on the simples of the East Indies of MONARDES on those of the West and afterwards of  Christopher à  COSTA's book satisfied for a time the impatience of the public  These authors were translated into English  James  FRAMPTON a merchant of  London who had resided long at  Seville  from whence he returned in translated MONARDES into English the next year under the title of "Joyful News out of the New Founde World from the Spanish of  Monardus  " in  o  CLUSIUS put GARCIAS  ab  HORTO into Latin in and  James  GARET had also translated from the Spanish the work of  à  COSTA These books were incentives to curiosity and the thousand novelties which were brought into  England  by our circumnavigators RALEIGH and CAVENDISH in and excited a degree of attention which at this day cannot without the aid of considerable recollection be easily conceived RALEIGH himself appears to have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of nature than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period And posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to this kingdom in having been the means if tradition may be credited of introducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the service of man A voyage round the globe howsoever  familiarized in ours was in that age a most interesting and fruitful occasion of enquiry  The return of RALEIGH and the fame of his manifold discoveries and collections brought over from the continent the celebrated CLUSIUS then in the th year of his age He who added more to the stock of Botany in his day than all his contemporaries united visited ENGLAND for the third time to partake at this critical juncture in the general gratification  At this eventful period GERARD was in the vigour of life and without doubt felt the influence and reaped the advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated  John  GERARD was born at  Nantwich  in  Cheshire  in the year and was educated a surgeon He removed to  London  where he obtained the patronage of the great  Lord Burleigh  who was himself a lover of plants and had the best collection in his garden of any nobleman in the kingdom GERARD had the superintendance of this fine garden and retained his employment as he tells us himself for twenty  years He lived in  Holborn  where also he had a large  physic  garden of his own which was probably the first of the kind in  England  for the number and variety of its productions It should seem that in his younger days he had taken a voyage into the Baltic since he mentions having seen the wild pines growing about  Narva  GERARD appears also to have been favoured by the college of physicians and is highly extolled by Dr BULLEYN Both LOBEL and Dr BROWNE physician to the queen wrote in Latin commendatory letters to him on the publication of his Herbal He attained to such eminence in his profession as to be chosen master of the company He died about the year  There is a half sheet print of GERARD prefixed to his own edition of the "Herbal" done in the d year of his age and a small oval one at the bottom of a full half sheet frontispiece before JOHNSON's edition  The earliest publication of GERARD was the list of his own garden in Holborn  under the following title "  Catalogus Arborum Fruticum ac Plantarum tam indigenarum quam exoticarum in horto  JOHANNIS GERARDI  civis ac chirurgi Londinensis nascentium  Impensis J Norton "  o  and again in  The first edition was dedicated to Lord BURLEIGH but that nobleman dying before the publication of the second it was inscribed to his patron  Sir Walter  RALEIGH  This little piece from the nature of the publication is become very scarce I believe there is only a manuscript copy of it in the collection of  Sir  JOSEPH BANKS  We are informed in the life of Dr BULLEYN that GERARD's Garden contained near eleven hundred sorts of plants of foreign and domestic growth from whence says Mr  Oldys  "it may appear that our ground would produce other fruits besides hips and haws acorns and pignuts"  for at this time  "kitchengarden wares were imported from Holland and fruits from France"  There are one thousand  and thirtythree species in this Catalogue and the following attestation written by LOBEL is annexed  "  Herbas stirpes frutices suffrutices et arbusculas hoc catalogo recensitas quamplurimas ac fere omnes me vidisse Londini in horto Johanni  GERARDI  chirurgi et botanici peroptimi non enim omnes eodem sed variis temporibus anni pullulascunt enascuntur et florent Attestor Matthias De  LOBELL  ipsis calendis Junii  "  In came out his "HERBAL or GENERAL HISTORY OF PLANTS" printed by John Norton in folio and some authors mention another impression in  That the foundation of this work was a translation of DODOENS's Herbal a comparison of the two ascertains beyond a doubt LOBEL both in his animadversions on RONDELETIUS and in his  Stirpium Illustrationes  informs us that Dr PRIEST at the expence of Mr  Norton  had been engaged to make a translation of DODONAEUS's  Pemptades  and dying soon after he had finished it the manuscript came into GERARD's  hands who has been censured for having endeavoured to conceal his possessing these papers and for assuming to himself the merit of the translation when it is generally agreed that his knowledge of the Latin language was not equal to such an undertaking LOBEL indeed judged the same of Dr PRIEST and points out instances of his insufficiency It must however be allowed that GERARD is not backward in confessing his want of skill in the learned languages LOBEL farther informs us that when the work was in the press and that part of the first book printed relating to grasses his friend  James  GARET a person eminently skilled in flowers and exotics admonished  Norton  of some gross errors on which the printer engaged LOBEL to superintend the work that he actually did correct it "in a thousand places" and that there were many other mistakes which GERARD would not allow him to alter alleging that it was sufficiently correct and that  "LOBEL had forgotten the English language"  In order further to conceal his plagiarism  LOBEL adds that he has inverted the distribution of the chapters in DODOENS's book and adopted that of the  Adversaria  This may be considered as a futile objection and even turned into an approbation of LOBEL's method but he charges him also with largely plundering the  Adversaria  without any acknowledgment  GERARD comprises the whole vegetable kingdom in three books The  first  contains the grasses grain rushes reeds flags and bulbousrooted plants The  second  all herbs used in diet physic or for ornament and pleasure The  third  trees shrubs fruitbearing plants rosins gums roses heaths mosses mushrooms and sea plants The whole divided into upwards of eight hundred chapters which in the arrangement of that time may if the expression is allowable be considered as so many genera  In each chapter the several species are described then follow the place time of flowering names and virtues  The figures Mr  Norton  procured from  Frankfort  being the same blocks which had been used for the Dutch Herbal of TABERNAEMONTANUS  in In this manner GERARD with DODOENS for his foundation by taking in also many plants from CLUSIUS and from LOBEL by the addition of some from his own stock published a volume which from its being well timed from its comprehending almost the whole of the subjects then known by being written in English and ornamented with a more numerous set of figures than had ever accompanied any work of the kind in this kingdom obtained great repute To this we must add the fortunate circumstance of its acquiring afterwards so learned an editor as JOHNSON which established the character of it and gave it precedence as a popular book for more than a century And notwithstanding his manifest inferiority to LOBEL in point of learning it must yet be owned that GERARD contributed greatly to bring forward the knowledge of plants in  England  His connection with the great and his situation in  London  favoured an extensive correspondence both with foreigners and his own countrymen and his success in procuring new exotics as well as scarce  indigenous plants was equal to his diligence and assiduity In fact we owe to GERARD and his friends the discovery of many new English plants and his name will be remembered by botanists with esteem when the utility of his Herbal is superseded That he was considered as possessing a very extensive share of this science we are justified in believing on the testimony of Mr  George  BAKER chief surgeon to the queen who assures us that he saw him  "tried with one of the best strangers that ever came into  England  and was accounted in  Paris  the only man being recommended to me" says BAKER "by that famous man AMBROSE PAREY and he being here was desirous to go abroad with some of our herbarists for the which I was the mean to bring them together and one whole day we spent therein searching the rarest simples but when it came to the trial my Frenchman did not know one to his four  PLUMIER gave the name GERARDIA to a plant of the  didynamous  class discovered in thetropical regions of America to which LINNAEUS has since added five species  "  Among the many who promoted GERARD's work by their communications I must not omit the names of  Thomas  HESKETH of  Lancashire Thomas  EDWARDS apothecary at  Exeter  both skilled in the knowledge of English plants  James  GARET of  London  apothecary "a curious searcher of simples" He was the correspondent of CLUSIUS to whom he communicated a great number of natural curiosities particularly of exotic growth and is mentioned with great respect by that learned foreigner in numerous places of his  Libri Exoticorum  He seems to have been one of the principal cultivators of tulips which he propagated by seeds and bulbs for twenty years every season bringing forth as GERARD observes  "new plants of sundry colours not before seen all which to describe particularly were to roll  Sisiphus  's stone or number the sands"  I find three persons of the same name  James  GARET the father and  James  the son and  Peter  as I suppose the brother of  James  the elder PARKINSON speaking probably of the last informs us that he was originally a druggist in Limestreet  He was I believe the translator of  à  COSTA as hath been before noted  Mr Bredwell  "practitioner in physic a learned and diligent searcher of simples"  in the west of  England  Mr  Nicholas  LETE a merchant of London  "greatly in love with rare and faire flowers for which he doth carefully send into  Syria  having a servant there at  Aleppo  and in many other countries for which myself and the whole land are much bound unto him"  Dr  John  MERSHE of  Cambridge  Mr  James  COLE a merchant of  London  "a lover of plants and very skilful in the knowledge of them"  Among those of eminent station who patronised the science GERARD does due honour to Sir  Walter  RALEIGH Lord  Edward  ZOUCH the patron of LOBEL who brought plants and seeds with him from  Constantinople  and to Lord HUNSDON Lord High Chamberlain of  England  who he says  "is worthy of triple honour for his care in getting as also for his curious keeping such rare and strange things from the farthest parts of the world"  CHAP  Johnson  the improver of  Gerard's  bookAnecdotes ofHis  Iter

by his unwearied pains advanced with good natural parts" says Mr  Wood  "he attained to be the best herbalist of his age in  England  "  He was first announced to the public by a small piece under the title of "ITER IN AGRUM CANTIANUM  et  ERICETUM HAMSTEDIANUM which  were the first local catalogues published in  England  He soon after acquired great credit by his new edition and emendation of GERARD's "Herbal"  In the civil wars his zeal for the royal cause led him into the army in which he greatly distinguished himself and the university of  Oxford  in consideration of his merit and learning added to that of his loyalty conferred upon him the degree of doctor of physic May  In the army he had the rank of lieutenant colonel to Sir  Marmaduke  RAWDON governor of  Basinghouse  Mr  Granger  informs us that  "he set fire to the  Grange  near that fortress which consisted of twenty houses and killed and burnt about three hundred of Sir William  Waller  's men wounded five hundred more and took arms ammunition and provisions from the enemy"  Wood adds  "that going with a party on the th of September to succour certain of the forces belonging to that house which went to the town of  Basing  to fetch provisions thence but beaten back by the  enemy headed by that notorious rebel Colonel  Richard Norton  he received a shot in the shoulder of which he died in a fortnight after At which time his worth did justly challenge funeral tears being then no less eminent in the garrison for his valour and conduct as a soldier than famous through the kingdom for his excellency as an herbalist and physician"  I have mentioned Johnson's  Iter Cantianum  and  Ericetum Hamstedianum  but not having seen either I can give no account of them  In he published his improved edition of GERARD under the title of "The HERBAL  or  GENERAL HISTORY  of  PLANTS gathered by  John  GERARD of  London  very much enlarged and amended by  Thomas  JOHNSON citizen and apothecary of  London  for Islip and Norton" fol and again pp  An interval of thirtysix years from the date of  Gerard's  work had effected a great change in the state of botanical knowledge  many new plants had been introduced and many valuable works published on the continent particularly the  Hortus Eystettensis  in and the  Prodromus  of Bauhine in No publications had appeared at home except such as were adapted to the Florist and Gardener  Gaspar Bauhine  's invaluable  Pinax  had facilitated and shortened the labour of consulting preceding authors All these circumstances were favourable to JOHNSON and his acknowledged superiority to GERARD in the learned languages might justly raise the expectation of the public insomuch that it becomes a matter of speculation why JOHNSON acquiesced in the character of an editor only It may indeed be converted into a strong presumption of the value set by the public on GERARD which probably prevented the risk of a new title  The general expectation was not disappointed The advantages above noted enabled JOHNSON to amplify and improve his author to such a degree that his book eminently deserves the  encomium  that HALLER has bestowed upon it when he calls  it  "  dignum opus et totius rei herbariae eo aevo notae compendium  "  After what has been said of the plan as it stands in GERARD it remains only to shew briefly what JOHNSON has done In about twelve pages he has prefixed a concise candid and judicious account of the most material writers on the subject from the earliest ages to the time in which he wrote concluding with a particular account of his own work from its origin in Dr PRIEST's translation After this follows a table pointing out with great precision all his additions by which we learn that he enriched the work with more than eight hundred plants not in GERARD and upwards of seven hundred figures besides innumerable corrections By procuring the same cuts that GERARD used to which collection a considerable accession had been made and by having some new blocks cut his work contained a greater number of figures than any Herbal extant the whole amounting to He informs us in an apology he makes for not inserting his additional matter in the edition of  that he intended to travel throughout the kingdom in search of the more rare plants and afterwards to comprise all his discoveries in an appendix  In he published "MERCURIUS BOTANICUS  sive  PLANTARUM  gratia suscepti Itineris anno  DESCRIPTIO  cum earum Nominibus Latinis et Anglicis  "  Lond  vo pp  It is dedicated to  Sir Theodore  MAYERNE and others of the college in his own and the names of his associates in the excursion who were all of the company of the Apothecaries It was the result of a journey through  Oxford  to  Bath  and  Bristol  and back by  Southampton  the Isle of  Wight  and  Guildford  made with the professed design to investigate rare plants He has described in not inelegant Latin their rout which took up only twelve days and the agreeable reception they met with among their medical acquaintance We meet with a list of exotics amounting to cultivated by Mr  George  GIBBS a surgeon at  Bath  who had made a voyage to  Virginia  from whence he brought many new plants which as it exhibits the advanced state of  gardening in this country at that time is now a matter of curiosity  The plants of spontaneous growth enumerated in this short tour varieties being excluded exceed six hundred which at a time when the  cryptogamiae  were scarcely noticed and in the season when neither the very early nor late plants could be seen is no inconsiderable number In this catalogue are several not discovered in  England  before With this tour JOHNSON gave his small tract "  De Thermis Bathonicis sive earum descriptio vires utendi tempus modus  c" Lond pp There are three small plans of the baths and one of the city which seem to be copied from Speed's map These are now pleasing curiosities to the lovers of antiquity and to all who contemplate the astonishing increase of the city since that time  This was followed by "PARS ALTERA  sive  PLANTARUM  gratia suscepti Itineris in Cambriam seu Walliam  DESCRIPTIO" Lond  o    JOHNSON if not the first was among the earliest Botanists who visited  Wales  and  Snowdon  with the sole intention of  discovering the rarities of that country in the vegetable kingdom The journey seems to have answered his purpose and afforded him a rich harvest In this expedition he first found the yellow poppy  papaver cambricum  mountain sawwort  serratula alpina  roseroot  rhodiola rosea  and several other plants  I cannot ascertain the age of JOHNSON at his death but there is reason to think he could not be far advanced in life if indeed he was arrived at the meridian of it I ground my opinion on the circumstance of LOBEL's total silence relating to him in his  Adversaria  printed in Engaged as JOHNSON was in the exercise of a profession which independent of the calls of duty demands much sacrifice of time to the forms and civilities of life his HERBAL is an ample testimony of zeal and industry I do not find that he was the author of any other publications than those of which I have given some account but he translated the works of  Ambrose  PAREY which he published at  London  in They were reprinted if I mistake not  for the last time in This excellent man who in the character of surgeon successively served four sovereigns of  France  was attached to the protestant cause and for his extraordinary merit and his having cured  Charles  IX of a tendon wounded in bleeding was saved from the massacre of St  Bartholomew  He survived this event years and died in His works were collected by himself in in folio and ran through nine or ten editions on the continent PAREY's improvements in his profession had been singularly important there can be no doubt therefore that our author performed a very acceptable service to his countrymen by putting his writings into an English dress  MILLER consecrated the name of JOHNSON by assigning it to a berrybearing shrub of  Carolina  belonging to the  tetrandrous  class first figured by PLUKENET  tab  f and since by CATESBY  vol    tab  The English Botanists who must consider JOHNSON as entitled to so honourable a distinction among their worthies will regret that his name should not be retained in the Linnaean system in preference to  Callicarpa  by which term this shrub is now well known in the English gardens    Before JOHNSON is dismissed it would be unjust not to notice some of those to whom the author was especially indebted for assistance and for the communication of English plants Among these the first place is due to Mr  John  GOODYER of  Maple Durham  in  Hampshire  whose name occurs repeatedly in GERARD's "Herbal" and very frequently in PARKINSON's in which he is stiled  "a great lover and curious searcher of plants who besides this" speaking of the  geranium saxatile  "hath found in our country many other plants not imagined to grow in our land"  He seems not only to have been what may be called a  practical  Botanist but learned and critically versed in the history of the science This may be fairly inferred from his curious communication relating to the manuscripts under the name of APULEIUS  Madaurensis  and from his observations on the  saxifrage  of the ancients inserted at p The great number of rare English plants which Mr GOODYER first brought to light entitles  him to the most reputable rank among those who have advanced the botanical knowledge of this kingdom  Mr  George  BOWLES of  Chisselhurst  in  Kent  also distinguished himself by his successful investigation of many new plants He spent some time in  Wales  where his discoveries were very ample and he is mentioned with particular attention in numerous instances by our author  The names of JOHNSON's associates in his Kentish and other simpling excursions occur in the preface and in the body of the work we meet also with the following  John  TRADESCANT the elder who became famous afterwards for his fine garden and museum of natural curiosities  Sir  John  TUNSTAL gentleman usher to the queen is recorded as possessing a garden at  Edgcome  in Surrey stored with plants which are said to have belonged to the queen  Mr  Thomas  GLYN who first found that elegant plant the  gnaphalium marinum  on the coast of Wales  Mr  Hugh  MORGAN apothecary to the queen before mentioned under the article of LOBEL  Mr  Robert  ABBOT of  Hatfield  near St  Albans  a learned preacher and an excellent and diligent herbarist  BOELIUS or BOEL of whom further notice more properly comes under the article of PARKINSON  Mr  John  REDMAN  "a skilful herbarist"  an inhabitant of the northern part of England  Frequent and respectable notice is also taken of Mr  John  PARKINSON the subject of the succeeding article His  Paradisus Terrestris  is much commended and his garden referred to as abounding in choice plants  CHAP  Parkinson  Brief account of his lifeHis  Paradisus  the best view of the state of the flower garden in that age  Theatrum Botanicum  a more original and laboured performance than  Gerard's Herbal  Its merit not sufficiently acknowledged by his successors  Boel  and other contemporaries of  Parkinson  PARKINSON  JOHN  PARKINSON was born in I regret that I am not enabled to supply a more ample account of this laborious man whose learning and abilities appear to me not to have been justly appreciated He was bred an apothecary and lived in  London  He was contemporary with GERARD and LOBEL during the latter part of their lives and survived JOHNSON several years LOBEL in the second part of his  Adversaria  and JOHNSON in his  Gerardus Emaculatus  speak of him as a man of eminence in his profession and as possessed of  a garden well stored with rarities In fact he rose to such a degree of reputation as to be appointed apothecary to King  James  and at the publication of his "Theatre of Plants" he obtained as we learn by Sir  Theodore  MAYERNE's commendatory letter prefixed to it the title from  Charles  the First of  Botanicus Regius Primarius  The time of his death I cannot ascertain but as his "Herbal" was published in and he appears to be living at that time he must have attained his d year There is a print of him prefixed to his  Paradisus  in the d year of his age and a small oval one in the title of his "Herbal" or "Theatre of Plants"  His first publication was the "PARADISI IN SOLE PARADISUS TERRESTRIS or a garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our English ayre will permit to be nursed up with a kitchen garden of all manner of herbs roots and fruits for meat or sause used with us and an orchard of all sorte of fruitbearing trees and shrubbes fit for our land together with the right ordering planting and preserving  of them and their uses and vertues Collected by  John  PARKINSON apothecary of London " Folio pp  There was a second edition published after the author's death corrected and enlarged in  As the subject of this book interests the florist and gardener merely it comes less within the scope of this work than his "Herbal" It is dedicated to Queen  Elizabeth  and agreeably to the panegyrical custom of the times is set off with recommendatory verses among which we meet with some in Latin from  Thomas  JOHNSON doubtless the editor of GERARD and a Latin letter in a high strain of eulogy from Sir  Theodore  MAYERNE  The plants are arranged without any other order than that expressed in the title page Garden flowers are divided into chapters according to the generical names of the time kitchen plants into chapters fruit trees and shrubs into chapters and a corollary of species Nearly one thousand plants are separately described of which seven hundred and eighty are figured  on one hundred and nine tables which appear to have been cut on purpose for this work Many are copied from CLUSIUS and LOBEL The figures are less commendable for the design than the execution and are much inferior on the whole to those of GERARD's "Herbal" In the Latin names the author has made use principally of  Casper  BAUHINE some are taken from LOBEL The mode of arrangement in each chapter is similar to that of GERARD After the description of all the species follow the place time of flowering synonyms and virtues Less is spoken of the culture than seems to be requisite  Several Englishmen had written on gardening and agriculture in the sixteenth century of whom the first on husbandry as far as I can find was  Antony  FITZHERBERT a famous lawyer and justice of the King's Bench whose "Booke of Husbandrie" was printed first in One of the earliest if not the first on gardening is  Thomas  HILL "His profytable Art of Gardening" printed in The next was "The new Orchard and Garden" by  William LAWSON in In Sir  Hugh  PLATT the author of many other useful tracts put forth his "Garden of Eden" a book of great merit in its time All these passed through numerous editions and the last preserved credit to the end of the century  PARKINSON however as I apprehend was the first author who separately described and figured the subjects of the  Flower Garden  The  Paradisus Terrestris  is therefore at this time a valuable curiosity as exhibiting the most compleat view of the extent of the English garden at the beginning of the last century Intertropical productions had been but sparingly imported The real stove plants are very rare throughout the book There are some American species and particularly from  Virginia  as being a part of that continent with which  England  had the most frequent intercourse But the principal productions of the English gardens were exotic European and Grecian plants some Asiatic and a few from the northern coasts of  Africa  A modern florist wholly unacquainted  with the state of the art at the time PARKINSON wrote would perhaps be surprized to find that his predecessors could enumerate besides sixteen described as distinct species one hundred and twenty varieties of the  tulip  sixty  anemonies  more than ninety of the  narcissus  tribe fifty  hyacinths  fifty  carnations  twenty  pinks  thirty  crocuses  and above forty of the  iris  genus In the orchard we find above sixty kinds of  plums  as many  apples  and  pears  thirty  cherries  and more than twenty  peaches  In PARKINSON published his "THEATRUM BOTANICUM or Theatre of Plants or an Herbal of a large extent containing therein a more ample and exact history and declaration of the physical herbs and plants that are in other authors encreased by the access of many hundreds of new rare and strange plants from all the parts of the world with sundry gummes and other physical materials than hath been hitherto published by any before and a most large demonstration of their nature and virtues Shewing withal the many errors differences  and oversights of sundry authors that have formerly written of them and a certain confidence or most probable conjecture of the true and genuine herbs and plants distributed into sundry classes or tribes for the more easy knowledge of the many herbs of one nature and property with the chief notes of Dr  Lobel  Dr  Bonham  and others inserted therein" London Folio pp SEGUIER mentions and edition in which I never saw and suspect it was not a new impression  This work was the labour of PARKINSON's life and was not published until he was arrived at a very advanced period He tells us in the preface that owing  "to the disastrous times"  and other impediments the printing of it was long retarded Originally it was intended to have contained only the medicinal herbs under the title of "A physical Garden of Simples" but he enlarged his plan and endeavoured to comprehend all the Botany of his time It is manifest even from a cursory view of it that it is a work of much more originality  than that of GERARD and it contains abundantly more matter than the last edition of that author with all JOHNSON's augmentations In the general disposition of the subject the order is chiefly founded on the known or supposed qualities and virtues of the plants being divided into seventeen tribes as follow    Plantae odoratoe  Sweetsmelling plants    Catharticae  Purging plants    Venenatae narcoticae nocivae et alexipharmicae  Venemous sleepy and hurtful plants and their counterpoisons    Saxifragae  Saxifrages or breakstone plants    Vulnerariae  Wound herbs    Resrigerantes et intubaceae  Cooling and succorylike herbes    Calidae et acres  Hot and sharpbiting plants    Umbelliferae  Umbelliferous    Cardui et spinosae  Thistles and thorny plants    Filices et herbae capillares  Ferns and capillary herbes    Legumina  Pulses    Cerealia  Corn    Gramina junci arundines  Grasses rushes and reeds    Paludosae aquaticae marinae musci et fungi  Marsh water and sea plants mosses and mushrooms    Miscellaneae  The unordered tribe    Arbores et frutices  Trees and shrubbes    Exoticae et peregrinae  Outlandish plants    Appendix  This heterogeneous classification which seems to be founded on that of  Dodoens  sometimes on the medicinal qualities sometimes on the habit and on the place of growth shews the small advances that had been made towards any truly scientific distribution On the contrary both GERARD JOHNSON and PARKINSON had rather gone back by not sufficiently pursuing the example of LOBEL  In the particular disposition of the subjects under each chapter or genus PARKINSON follows the rules of GERARD and JOHNSON by giving after the Latin and English name the descriptions at large then the place of growth and time of flowering the synonyms and lastly the virtues and uses  Nice discrimination of species from each other or from varieties must not be expected in this work more than in GERARD or his  Emaculator  Almost every Botanist was then a Florist too CLUSIUS himself who had enlarged the science by his own discoveries beyond any other man continued to raise tulips from seed for more than years PARKINSON's "  Paradisus  " proves his attachment to the Flower Garden in the early part of his life and this bias influenced him throughout the "Theatre of Plants" As yet no line had been drawn with sufficient accuracy between species and variety between nature and the effect of culture or of soil and situation nor was this brought about till the essential parts of vegetables the flower and the fruit became  objects of classification instead of the vague distinctions hitherto observed of which it may be sufficient to adduce one example out of hundreds equally futile The sea cabbage  brassica orientalis  a  siliquose  plant is ranked by GERARD and JOHNSON as well as by PARKINSON even contrary to the examples of CLUSIUS and DODONAEUS under the same generical name with the thorow wax  bupleurum  an  umbelliferous  plant merely because the leaf is of the  persoliate  kind  These are defects common to the age and PARKINSON must not be appreciated by modern improvement but by comparison with his contemporaries In this view if I am not mistaken he will appear more of an original author than GERARD or JOHNSON independent of the advantages he might derive from being posterior to them His "  Theatre  " was carried on thro' a long series of years and he profited by the works of some late authors which though equally in JOHNSON's power he had neglected to use PARKINSON's descriptions in many instances appear to be new He is  more particular in pointing out the places of growth In the enumeration of the synonyms he has not only given nearly the whole of BAUHINE's "  Pinax  " but very frequently has himself consulted the original authors and enters minutely into a discussion of their doubts In the account of the virtues and uses PARKINSON is diffuse It was his professed design to make his work a  Materia Medica  and if in him we meet with the qualities of plants estimated on Galenical principles by the degrees of hot and cold moist and dry c it was the theory os the day from which authors of higher eminence were not emancipated He not only gives the opinions of the Greek and Roman physicians but of the Arabians and has translated from the moderns and his contemporaries whatever could illustrate his subject and render it as perfect as the intelligence of the times would allow To this end he has extracted largely from CLUSIUS's "Exotics" from D'ACOSTA MONARDES and GARCIAS  ab  HORTO on the drugs and simples of the East and West Indies of which at that  time many were newly introduced and imperfectly known  PARKINSON's work is much more extensive than JOHNSON's in the number of subjects described he having taken as before observed advantages which the  Emaculator  of GERARD neglected Many of the plants of  Aegypt  from  Prosper  ALPINUS many of the North American or Canadian plants from CORNUTUS and some from COLUMNA's work are introduced He neglected no opportunities of procuring new plants from abroad The nature of his profession did not allow him to make distant or frequent excursions in  England  but by the assistance of his correspondents and some of LOBEL's posthumous writings which he purchased he was enabled to enlarge not only the catalogue of British plants but to introduce many exotics before unknown  JOHNSON had described about plants PARKINSON has near These accumulations rendered the "THEATRUM BOTANICUM" the most copious book on the subject in the English language  and it may be presumed that it gained equally the approbation of medical people and of all those who were curious and inquisitive in this kind of knowledge Both this work and GERARD's afterwards acquired consequence by the references of Mr RAY who may be said in the language of the  Catalogus Oxoniensis  to have raised them to classical eminence in English Botany and preserved them from oblivion as long as his own works remain Without any design of depriving JOHNSON of his due praise yet it is obvious from the recollection of certain circumstances that PARKINSON laboured under disadvantages and impediments which probably tended to depress his work at the time although it had undoubtedly been carrying on through a longer series of years than  Johnson  's and was more copious in its design  JOHNSON had the opportunity that GERARD himself obtained of procuring all the cuts from abroad PARKINSON's on the other hand though copied from the same figures appear to have been cut anew purposely for his work The delay occasioned  by this circumstance besides the great expence was probably among the obstacles the author complains of which so long retarded the publication of his work Add to this that the figures were after all inferior to the old tables both in number and execution JOHNSON's exceed those of PARKINSON by more than an hundred Both these works may be considered as  Digests  of the Botany of the age in the English tongue but it is to be feared the same censure lies against them which  Caspar  BAUHINE lodged against DALECHAMP's history published in in which he demonstrated that more than plants were twice described  Nor is it wonderful that the attempt to comprehend and discriminate the whole vegetable kingdom was a plan too extensive for one man especially in the augmented state in which PARKINSON found it The magnitude of the design necessarily involved a multitude of errors and exposed both GERARD and PARKINSON to the censures of malignant critics Had the candour of LOBEL been equal to his  learning and knowledge he had spared much of his acrimony against these industrious writers whose laudable endeavours rather merited his applause  Among those contemporaries whose collateral assistance is acknowledged by PARKINSON Mr or as he is stiled in some parts of the work  Dr    William  BOEL claims particular notice He was a native of the Low Countries and had travelled into various parts of  Germany  and  Spain  had been in  Barbary  resided at  Tunis  and at the publication of "the Herbal" lived at  Lisbon  From all these countries he sent seeds of many plants before unknown in  England  He was the correspondent of CLUSIUS and seems to have been very zealous for the improvement of natural knowledge  Mr  John  GORDIER  "a great lover and curious searcher of plants who besides this" speaking of the  Geranium lucidum  "hath found in our country other plants not imagined to grow in our land"  In PARKINSON's works we also find the  name of Mrs  Thomazin  TUNSTAL a lady whom he celebrates not only for her taste in cultivating a garden which was well stored with exotics but for her knowledge of  English  botany and her discoveries of several curious vegetables found about  Ingleborough Hill  in  Lancashire  which were not known before to grow in  England  Whether she was allied to Sir  John  TUNSTAL noticed in the account of JOHNSON I cannot ascertain  Besides the names of BOWLES GOODYER TRADESCANT and others mentioned by JOHNSON we meet with the following as having contributed to the general stock  John  NEWTON surgeon at  Colliton Somersetshire  Dr  Antony  SADLER physician at  Exeter  Mr  William  QUICK apothecary  London  Mr BRADSHAUGH of  Yorkshire  Mr SILLIARD of  Dublin  and divers others  PARKINSON is commemorated for his botanical labours by PLUMIER in having his name applied to a  decandrous  tree a native of the  Caribbee  islands and of the adjacent continent well known in the English stoves and called in Jamaica the  Jerusalem thorn    CHAP  History of wooden cuts of plants  Plantin  's accumulation of these figuresFate of  Gesner  's excellent engravingsOf those to the Herbals of  Turner Gerard  and  ParkinsonParkinson  's the last of importance except  Salmon  's which were exhibited in  England  First copperplates of plants  WOODEN CUTS  AS we are now arrived at the period when wooden cuts were about to be superseded by engravings on metal PARKINSON's "Herbal" being the last of any importance in which they were used in  England  it may not be incongruous to our plan to notice the origin and progress of that art which contributed not a little to facilitate the knowledge of plants Rude as these representations were compared with the elegance of modern times yet in an age when specific distinctions were not fixed and the diagnostic of the plant depended  so much on habit they spoke to the eye and often discriminated the subject when the laboured description failed  It has been before observed that SEGUIER is of opinion the first Herbal with wooden cuts was the "  Buch der Natur  " "The Book of Nature" printed at  Augsburgh  in if not three years earlier These are thought to have passed into the HERBARIUS printed at  Mentz  in from which book was compiled the ORTUS SANITATIS printed at the same place in with improvements in the work in general and better figures by CUBA Of this work some notice has before been taken as the foundation of the English "Grete Herbal" first printed here in  The HORTUS SANITATIS was translated into various languages and in some newmodelled without concealing its origin according to the fancy of different editors and printers and passed through innumerable editions on the Continent having been the popular book on the subject as the "  Grete Herbal  " was in England for fisty or sixty years  It does not appear that CUBA was publicly known as the author of the HORTUS SANITATIS until EGENOLF a bookseller of  Frankfort  gave an improved edition with an entirely new set of figures under the care of EUCHARIUS RHODION or ROESLIN a physician of the same city in  Egenolf  's book passed through various editions until a better work was composed by DORSTEN under the title of "  Botanicon  " in at  Frankfort  in which the same figures were employed They were used also in the "  Encyclopaedia Medica  " of J DRYANDER in and in the succeeding year in an edition of DIOSCORIDES by  Hermann Ryff  printed by  Egenolf  Finally ADAM LONICER the soninlaw of  Egenolf  having totally reformed the work of CUBA employed them in his  Herbal  printed in In succeeding editions he introduced new figures took others from TRAGUS to the number in the whole of and composed a work which passed through a great number of editions and was not superseded in the present century as appears by an edition  printed so lately as in and even in  We are informed by TRAGUS that  Egenolf  spared no expence in the encouragement of artists to procure these icons rude and imperfect as they appear to us He secured to himself by this means the monopoly of printing  Herbals  for a succession of years and acquired both fame and riches  At length these were all superseded by those of BRUNSFELSIUS to his Herbal printed in which were drawn from nature and appear to have been the first that were worthy of notice These were however greatly excelled by FUCHSIUS in whose figures although only outlines are uncommonly beautiful and not less just They consist of five hundred figures in folio of the most common and useful plants and were copied in a smaller scale by many succeeding authors TRAGUS took most of them into his "History of German Plants" to which he added many new ones to the amount in all of Those of TRAGUS are little more  than outlines and allowing for the time they sufficiently well express the habit of most of the subjects  Egenolf  having set the example printers after this time themselves bore the expence of cutting the blocks by which means certain printers monopolised the printing of  Herbals  and a kind of commerce between them and authors took place and mutual exchanges were made for the use of each other's books Among these no one possessed at length a greater collection than the famous PLANTIN of  Antwerp  who recommended himself so highly by the excellency of his types and mode of executing his works Hence he became the common printer to several of the celebrated botanic writers of the sixteenth century When CLUSIUS published his French translation of DODOENS with  Loe  at  Antwerp  he gave figures copied from FUCHSIUS all which  Plantin  bought He afterwards acquired the figures cut for CLUSIUS's own works and those of LOBEL DODONAEUS besides some new blocks had the use of all the above in the "  Pemptades  " in which work contains figures TABERNAEMONTANUS  obtained the use of this collection namely those of FUCHSIUS CLUSIUS LOBEL and DODONAEUS to which he added those of MATTHIOLUS insomuch that his Herbal printed at  Frankfort  in comprehends more than two thousand figures DALECHAMP in his "General History of Plants" printed about the same time augmented them to near two thousand seven hundred  The fate of GESNER's excellent figures I can but briefly mention it forms a mortifying but curious anecdote in the literary history of the science Of the fifteen hundred figures left by GESNER prepared for his "History of Plants" at his death in a large share passed into the "  Epitome Matthioli  " published by CAMERARIUS in which contained in the whole figures and in the same year as also into a second edition in they embellished an abridged translation of MATTHIOLUS printed under the name of the "German Herbal" In the same blocks were used by  Uffenbach  for the Herbal of CASTOR DURANTES printed at  Frankfort  This publication however  comprehends only of these icons nearly another hundred being introduced of very inferior merit After this period CAMERARIUS the younger being dead these blocks were purchased by  Goerlin  a bookseller of  Ulm  and next served for the "  Parnassus Medicinalis illustratus  " of BECHER printed at that city in the second part of which work contains all those of the "  Epitome  " except six figures In they were taken into a German Herbal made up from MATTHIOLUS by  Bernard  VERZASCHA printed at  Basil  and such was the excellency of the materials and workmanship of these blocks that they were exhibited a sixth time in the "  Theatrum Botanicum  " or Kräuterbuch of ZWINGER being an amended edition of VERZASCHA printed also at  Basil  in with the addition of more than one hundred new blocks copied from C BAUHINE and TABERNAEMONTANUS and finally into a new edition of the same work so late as the year  Thus did the genius and labours of GESNER add dignity and ornament to the works of other men and even of some whose enmity he had experienced during his lifetime  Besides the above mentioned GESNER left five volumes consisting entirely of figures which after various vicissitudes became the property of TREW of  Norimberg  Sensible that whether we view the extent of GESNER's knowledge and learning or his singular industry such must be the veneration for his character that any of his remains must claim the attention of the curious the possessor gratified the public by the pen of Dr SCHMIEDEL with an ample specimen published in  Thus far for foreigners The rude icons of the "Grete Herbal" it has been observed were evidently copied from those in the HORTUS SANITATIS for that they were not the same tables appears from the diminished size Of the figures in TURNER's History which amount to upwards of the greater part are those of FUCHSIUS's octavo set and the remainder nearly were new LYTE printed his translation of DODOENS with  Loe  at  Antwerp  for the conveniency of his figures which are also borrowed from FUCHSIUS to which LYTE added about thirty new ones  GERARD in and JOHNSON his  "  Emaculator  " afterwards in and procured all the blocks from  Frankfort  with which the Herbal of TABERNAEMONTANUS had been illustrated JOHNSON by this means accumulated upwards of cuts  The blocks for PARKINSON's "  Theatrum  " and his "  Paradisus  " were I apprehend cut in  England  and those for the first seem to be copies from GERARD though much inferior in execution The last of the kind used in  England  were a new set cut for SALMON's "Herbal" in except I believe those for a very indifferent performance under the name of "An Herbal" published since that time in quarto  The earliest copperplates of plants on the Continent are said to be those of  Columna  in his "  Phytobasanos  " in In  England  except some single figures and the few plates in the first edition of PLOT's "Oxfordshire" in those of the "  Historia Oxoniensis  " are the first exhibition of any great work and of these the grasses are to this time perhaps unparalleled in the neatness and accuracy of the execution  CHAP  The botanical Garden founded at  Oxford  by  Henry  Earl of  DanbyJacob Bobart  the first IntendantTwo editions of the  Catalogus Oxoniensis  Account of the authors

received no encouragement from any public institutions but the time was now arrived when it acquired additional vigour and improvement from the foundation of a physicgarden at  Oxford  These elegant and necessary aids to science had considerably multiplied since the first foundations of  the kind before noticed in  Italy  and elsewhere Several universities in the more northern and western parts of  Europe  had procured the establishment of gardens  Paris  in  Leyden  in  Leipsic  in  Montpelier  in  Jena  in and  Oxford  in the year This last was owing to the munificence of HENRY  Earl  of  Danby  who gave for this purpose five acres of ground built greenhouses and stoves and an house for the accommodation of the gardener endowed the establishment and placed in it as the supervisor  Jacob  BOBART a German from  Brunswick  who lived as WOOD tells us in the gardenhouse and died there on February A list of the plants was published under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM  Horti medici  OXONIENSIS  Latinoanglicus et Anglicolatinus alphabetico ordine  " Oxon  o  pp and DILLENIUS informs us that BOBART drew up this catalogue In the preface we are told the garden contained species by which must be understood both exotic and indigenous including varieties of each The  plants are barely enumerated without any synonyms or references to any author The number of English species recited extends to or nearly The copiousness of this catalogue sets the zeal and diligence of BOBART in a favourable light Under his care and that of his son the garden of  Oxford  continued to flourish for many years  The CATALOGUS OXONIENSIS was republished in the year in a much improved state by the joint assistance of Dr STEPHENS Mr  William  BROWNE and the two BOBARTS father and son under the following title "CATALOGUS HORTI BOTANICI OXONIENSIS  alphabetice digestus duas praeterpropter plantarum chiliadas complectens priore duplo auctior idemque elimatior nec non etymologiis qua

eminent in botanical science He was born at the  Devizes  in  Wiltshire  and was first of St Alban's Hall  Oxon  afterwards made Fellow of New College by the visitors and became Principal of  Magdalen Hall  He died at  London  after the Restoration  MERRET without any notice of Dr STEPHENS expressly calls Mr BROWNE the author of this  Catalogue  and  Wood  says that he had the chief hand in it  William  BROWNE was a native of  Oxsord  became Bachelor of Divinity and Senior Fellow of Magdalen College He died in March aged about and was buried in the outer chapel of his college  In this enlarged edition the authors have in every instance where it was possible not only adopted the specifical appellations given by GERARD and PARKINSON to each  plant but quoted the page of their works This is the first book as far as I know on the subject printed in  England  in which the latter of these circumstances takes place It is remarkable that so obvious an assistance after having been introduced by  Caspar  BAUHINE in his "  Phytopinax  " should be wanting in the "  Pinax  " itself Had GERARD and PARKINSON retained throughout their works the exact synonyms of the authors from whom they transferred their plants and quoted the pages they would unquestionably have rendered their writings much more useful to posterity and have preserved them from disuse and oblivion for a much longer period The same may be observed of Mr RAY who has totally neglected this valuable improvement So novel was the practice that the authors of the HORTUS OXONIENSIS thought it necessary to apologise for it and shield themselves under the authority of the "  Hortus Eystettensis  "  There are many dubious and illascertained plants in this Catalogue and those marked as new are almost wholly varieties English Botany seems to have received little  or no accession by it and I am not aware of one indigenous plant first mentioned in this list  The second part or alphabetical list of English names is intended only to lead to the Latin generical term in the first part  HOW  Until this period no attempts had been made in  England  to separate the indigenous from exotic botany It is true Dr JOHNSON as before mentioned had published local catalogues of the plants of certain districts but no one had essayed a general list or description of the English plants alone in the way of what is now called a  Flora  a term which as far as I can find was first adopted by  Simon  PAULI for a catalogue of the plants of  Denmark  published in It is to Dr How that we owe the first sketch of a work of this kind and though he does not entitle his book  Flora  he yet mentions that term in his preface  William  How was born in  London  in the year and educated at Merchant Taylors school He became a commoner of St John's college  Oxford  at eighteen he  took his bachelor's degree in and that of master of arts in and entered on the physical line It does not appear that he ever took his doctor's degree though he was commonly called Dr How With many other scholars of that time he entered into the king's army and for his loyalty was promoted to the rank of captain in a troop of horse Upon the decline of the royal cause he prosecuted his studies in physic and practised in that faculty He lived first in St Lawrence Lane and afterwards in Milk Street He died about the beginning of September and was buried by the grave of his mother in St Margaret's church  Westminster  leaving behind him as Mr  Wood  says  "a choice library of books of his faculty and the character of a noted herbalist"  Dr How's principal publication and for which he is here recorded bears the following title  "PHYTOLOGIA BRITANNICA  natales exhibens indigenarum Stirpium sponte emergentium  " Lond  o  pp  The plants are arranged in the alphabetical order of the  Latin  names with one or  two synonyms taken as best pleased the author from various writers on the continent as well as from GERARD PARKINSON and LOBEL The place of growth to each plant is noticed and the particular spots where the rare ones grow are specified The list contains plants which as few mosses and fungi are enumerated is a copious catalogue for that time even admitting the varieties which the present state of botany would reject  The author of this little volume was unquestionably a man of very considerable learning and had a strong passion for the knowledge of plants but his situation in life does not seem to have allowed him the opportunity of travelling into the various parts of  England  to gratify his taste in  English  botany with which he was not critically and extensively acquainted Mr RAY in the preface to his "  Catalogus Plantarum Angliae  " has given a list of more than thirty species in the "  Phytologia  " which have no title to a place as indigenous plants of  England  Some of these being inhabitants of  Southern Europe others evidently the accidental outcasts of gardens and some as certainly mistaken for other plants as appeared from the impossibility of finding them in the spots which How had pointed out  The rare plants were almost wholly communicated by his friends Mr STONEHOUSE Dr BOWLES Mr HEATON Mr LOGGINS Mr GOODYER and others He drew some from a manuscript of Dr JOHNSON the editor of GERARD I wish it were in my power to commemorate these persons in a more ample manner who at an early period contributed to extend and illustrate English botany Mr STONEHOUSE in particular has deserved highly of the lovers of this science He appears to have travelled much in  England  from his recording the plants discovered by him in many counties In  Yorkshire  he was particularly conversant and I conjecture he lived at a place called  Darfield  near  Barnsley  in that county  Dr BOWLES and Mr GOODYER are I believe the same persons mentioned under  the article of JOHNSON Of Mr HEATON I shall take further notice in the sequel of these anecdotes  It has been observed that some of LOBEL's papers fell into the hands of PARKINSON and some into Dr How's possession These were the fragment of LOBEL's great work which How published in under the subsequent title  "  Matthiae de  LOBEL  MD botanographi regii eximii  STIRPIUM ILLUSTRATIONES  plurimas elaborantes inauditas plantas subreptitiis Joh  PARKINSONI  rapsodiis ex codice MS insalutato sparsim gravatae

which the editor has affixed would almost persuade the reader that he had published the work with a view to take an invidious retrospect of PARKINSON's "Theatre" In the preface to the "  Phytologia  " and in that of this work both written in a flowery and bombast stile as well  as throughout the notes he speaks of PARKINSON in very contemptuous language and represents him as having made LOBEL's observations his own without acknowledgment Whatever may have been the case in particular instances the attack on the whole was uncandid since PARKINSON in the very title of his "  Theatre  " professes to have made use of and inserted Dr LOBEL's notes together with those of Dr BONHAM and others In fact there is a petulance and an acrimony in the stile both of the author and of the editor of this work which howsoever exampled in the last age is happily much less frequently the language of literature in the present  CHAP  Some account of the  Tradescants  father and sonThe first who

materially to amplify what is more especially meant by English Botany or the discovery and illustration of the plants spontaneously growing in  England  yet in a work devoted to the commemoration of Botanists their name stands too high not to demand an honourable notice since they contributed at an early period by their  garden and museum to raise a curiosity that was eminently useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general  John  TRADESCANT was by birth a Dutch man as we are informed by A  Wood  On what occasion and at what period he came into  England  is not precisely ascertained He is said to have been for a considerable time in the service of Lord Treasurer SALISBURY and Lord WOOTON He travelled several years and into various parts of  Europe  as far eastward as into  Russia  He was in a fleet that was sent against the  Algerines  in and mention is made of his collecting plants in  Barbary  and in the isles of the Mediterranean He is said to have brought the  trifolium stellatum Lin  from the isle of  Fermentera  and his name frequently occurs in the second edition of GERARD by JOHNSON in PARKINSON's "Theatre of Plants" and in his "Garden of Flowers" printed in But I conjecture that TRADESCANT was not resident in  England  in the time of GERARD himself or known to him  He appears however to have been established  in  England  and his garden founded at  Lambeth  about the year he obtained the title of gardener to  Charles  I TRADESCANT was a man of extraordinary curiosity and the first in this country who made any considerable collection of the subjects of natural history He had a son of the same name who took a voyage to  Virginia  from whence he returned with many new plants They were the means of introducing a variety of curious species into this kingdom several of which bore their name  Tradescant's Spiderwort Tradescant's Aster  are well known to this day and LINNAEUS has immortalized them among the Botanists by making a new genus under their name of the  Spiderwort  which had before been called  Ephemeron  His Museum called  Tradescant  's Ark attracted the curiosity of the age and was much frequented by the great by whose means it was also much enlarged as appears by the list of his benefactors printed at the end of "his MUSEUM TRADESCANTIANUM" among whom after the names of the king and queen are found those of many of the first nobility  This small volume the author entitled  "MUSEUM TRADESCANTIANUM or a Collection of Rarities preserved at South  Lambeth  near  London  By  John  TRADESCANT"  o  It contains lists of his birds quadrupeds fish shells insects minerals fruits artificial and miscellaneous curiosities war instruments habits utensils coins and medals These are followed by a catalogue in English and Latin of the plants of his garden and a list of his benefactors The reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden drawn up in the year by the late Sir  William  WATSON and printed in the th volume of the Philosophical Transactions Prefixed to this volume were the prints of both father and son which from the circumstance of being engraved by HOLLAR has rendered the book well known to the collectors of prints by whom most of the copies have been plundered of the impressions  In what year the elder TRADESCANT died is not certain but his print abovementioned represents him as a man advanced in age  The son inherited the  museum  and bequeathed  it by a deed of gift to Mr ASHMOLE who lodged in  Tradescant  's house It afterwards became part of the  Ashmolean museum  and the name of TRADESCANT was unjustly sunk in that of  Ashmole  John the son died in His widow erected a curious monument in memory of the family in  Lambeth  church yard of which a large account and engravings from a drawing of it in the  Pepysian  library at  Cambridge  are given by the late learned Dr DUCARREL in the d volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  The name TRADESCANTIA was first applied by RUPPIUS a German in his  Flora Jenensis  to a plant introduced into the English gardens by TRADESCANT himself and sufficiently known by the appellation of  Tradescant's Spiderwort  to which genus LINNAEUS has since reduced six other species    R TURNER CULPEPPER and LOVELL  The influence of Astrology in Physic and Botany was far from being worn out in the middle of this age By the credulity and superstition of some and the dishonesty of others it still maintained its ground Several  physicians and other men of learning shewed some bias towards it Many practitioners of an inferior class and numerous empirics were still advocates for astrological influence in the preparation and application of simples  There is an Herbal written by  Robert  TURNER who calls himself  Botanologiae Studiosus  under the title of "BOTANOLOGIA the British Physician or The Nature and Vertues of English Plants exactly describing such as grow naturally in the land with their several names Greek Latin or English natures places where they flourish and are most proper to be gathered their degrees of temperature applications and vertues physical and

the manual of good ladies in the country is well known and to do the author justice his descriptions of common plants were drawn up with a  clearness and distinction that would not have disgraced a better pen  Yet there is one author of this order whose respectability might exempt him from total oblivion  Robert  LOVELL's "compleat Herbal" although said to be written by him whilst a young man is of so singular a complexion as to merit notice in a work of this kind were it only to regret the misapplication of talents which demonstrate an extensive knowledge of books a wonderful industry in the collection of his materials and not less judgment in the arrangement The first edition was printed in the second in in  o  at  Oxsord  pp exclusive of the introduction of pages and bears the following title "PAMBOTANOLOGIA  sive Enchiridion Botanicum  or A compleat Herbal containing the sum of antient and modern authors both Galenical and Chymical touching trees shrubs plants fruits flowers c in an

leans that way it may not be easy to direct them to a more concise or more perfectly methodical arrangement of simples according to the Galenical principles of the four elements temperaments and qualities than may be met with in the introduction to this book  The arrangement of the matter in the work itself is according to the alphabet of the English names to which is subjoined the place of growth the time of flowering then the name in Greek and the Latin officinal term There are no descriptions of the plants but the qualities and uses of each are collected from a profusion of authors and applied to all the species under each generical term the form in which the medicine should be given the authority for each carefully cited and the officinal  compounds into which they enter assiduously noticed The author includes simples both of exotic and of indigenous growth  He professes to have cited near two hundred and fifty authors of which he gives the list At p begins an appendix on the drugs of the East and West Indies extracted from the Arabians and from HERNANDEZ A copious index of names to all the plants of his "Herbal" with the synonyms especially of the older authors of such as are mentioned in TRADESCANT BAUHINE's  Pinax  of those which are in the foreign botanical gardens and not in that of  Oxford  and lastly of those in the PHYTOLOGIA BRITANNICA The work concludes with a large index of diseases with the appropriate remedies from the simples of his work In his catalogue of authors he gives the number of figures contained in their works which I transcribe as a matter of curiosity that cannot fail to gratify the botanical reader  Apollinaris s Albertus    Alpinus Prosper    Bauhinu J    Brunsfelsius    Camerarius    Clusius Rariores

at  Amsterdam  the same year and in The descriptions which are short are taken from RAY's history the virtues from a variety of authors The natural places of growth of the English plants are specified but the author betrays his want of botanical knowledge by enumerating several indigenous as exotic plants PECHEY was the first who introduced into use the  casumunar  of which he is said to have made a secret and considered it as a corrector of the  Peruvian bark  In the same year was published "PHILOBOTANOLOGIA  s Historia Vegetabilium sacra  or A Scriptural Herbal By  William  WESTMACOTT"  o  Not having seen this volume I can give no further account of it  SALMON  If my readers will excuse the anachronism I am here tempted to anticipate the name of an author the complexion of whose  writings renders it not improper to notice him after CULPEPPER and LOVELL although in the time he lived the influence of astrology had lost still more of its power To the fastidious critic in Botany it might need some apology that I introduce into these anecdotes the name of SALMON well known as a multifarious writer and author of numerous publications in physic all of the empirical cast I confess however I could not pass over in total silence a writer to whom although no praise can be due as a botanist yet the commendation of industry ought not to be withheld from a man who could bestow twenty years labour in the compilation of "an Herbal" of pages in folio I will recite the title which will sufficiently shew the nature of his work  "The ENGLISH HERBAL or History of Plants

choice increase and way of management as well for profit as delectation adorned with exquisite icons or figures of the most considerable species By  William  SALMON MD"  London  fol vol  The order of SALMON's book is alphabetical and as it is a work of mere compilation he professes to have consulted all the botanical authors of repute and enumerates the names of such His design was to treat on medicinal herbs principally As a botanical work it is beneath all criticism the errors in this way being enormous both in multitude and degree In detailing the powers of simples he follows the Galenic terms of expression ufed by the writers of the preceding century and distributes with a lavish hand extraordinary and numerous powers to almost every herb he describes Exclusive of his industry some merit is due to SALMON for the regular arrangement of  his subjects subordinate to his method qualities which under the direction of more skill in Botany and a sounder judgement in discriminating the properties of simples might have enabled him to have executed more effectually what seems to have been his purpose that of superseding the Herbals of GERARD and PARKINSON in which he totally failed His tables I have noticed heretofore in speaking on wooden cuts But from these authors I return to writers of dignity and importance and with peculiar satisfaction to the view especially of a character from whose penetrating genius and persevering industry not Botany alone but Zoology may date a new aera On this occasion I singularly lament that I am not furnished with any new materials to illustrate the life of RAY of whom it may with truth be maintained that in these branches of natural history he became without the patronage of an  Alexander  the  Aristotle  of  England  and the  Linnaeus  of the time  CHAP  Retrospective view of botanical science in the period immediately antecedent to  Ray  A detailed account of the life and writings of  Ray  His  Catalogus CantabrigiensisRay  's three first botanical toursAppendixes to the  Cambridge Catalogue  Foreign travelsFourth tour in  England  Elected fellow of the Royal Society  RAY  IF we here take a retrospective view of the progress of botany during the first period of the seventeenth century we find that however particular individuals both in  England  and on the continent might have laboured in its advancement it was not on the whole in a flourishing state either here or in any other part of  Europe  From the time of the BAUHINES even to that of RAY its progress as a science was slow The Remains of  John  BAUHINE his "  Historia Plantarum Universalis  " printed in in three large  folio volumes at the expence of florins defrayed by F L  à Graffenreid  was the principal performance on the continent and that indeed was invaluable It is a monument of learning and industry of which few examples can be expected in any one age That which GESNER performed for zoology  John  BAUHINE effected in botany It is in reality a repository of all that was valuable in the ancients in his immediate predecessors and in the discoveries of his own time relating to the history of vegetables and is executed with that accuracy and critical judgment which can only be exhibited by superior talents  The obstacles to the improvement of botany were various  Europe  had been involved in war the perpetual enemy to free intercourse among the learned and to commerce which is ever friendly to natural science Simples were neglected in physic for medicines drawn from chymistry Even alchymy yet employed the industry of many in every nation of  Europe  Botanical gardens although several both public and private had been established did not however  flourish The  Indies  had not yet poured in their treasures with that liberal hand which was soon after experienced Even the passion of the florist for varieties assisted in depressing the genuine spirit of the botanist But the time was now approaching when botany was about to receive a capital advantage and embellishment by the introduction and establishment of  system  of the rise and progress of which it will not be incongruous to my plan to give a short account since this great revolution formed a new aera in the history of the science As the revival of it however did not take place till the time of Mr RAY and Dr MORISON I will postpone what I have to say on this subject till I have given some account of the writings of those justly celebrated naturalists by whose labours system itself was restored and improved  The earliest anecdotes of Mr RAY to which I can refer are some brief outlines of his life in the "Compleat History of Europe for the year " A more connected account of this learned and excellent man may be seen in the "General Dictionary"  and the "Biographia Britannica" but the most detailed relation is that of Dr SCOTT published in from materials collected by Dr DERHAM This is well abridged in the  Biographical Dictionary  It is much to be regretted that our curiosity has not been more amply gratified than by these short and imperfect memoirs  A more circumstantial narrative of the life of Mr RAY would even at this distance of time be a valuable accession to biography and highly grateful to those who are sensible of the great improvements which he gave to the science of natural history in general nor could sufficient justice be done to his manifold talents discoveries and writings but by a pen of the first eminence in biographical literature  The limits of my plan will not allow of more than a general detail of the principal events of his life as connected in chronological order with his writings  John  Wray  or as he always spelt his name after the year RAY was born at  Black Notley  near  Braintree  in  Essex  Nov  His father though in so humble a situation as that of a blacksmith sent his son to the grammarschool at  Braintree  and in entered him at Catherine Hall in  Cambridge  from whence he removed in less than two years to Trinity College where the politer sciences were more cultivated Dr BARROW was his fellow pupil and intimate friend and on account of their early proficiencies both were the favourites of their learned tutor Dr DUPORT He was chosen minorfellow of Trinity in in was made Greek lecturer of the college in mathematical lecturer and in humanity reader These appointments were sufficient testimonies of his talents and abilities at this early period He afterwards passed through the offices of the college and became tutor to many gentlemen of honourable birth and attainments who gave him due praise and acknowledgments for his watchful care of them He also distinguished himself while in college as a sensible and rational preacher and a sound divine As his favourite study was the  works of God he laid at this time in his college lectures the foundation of his "Wisdom of God in the Creation" and of his "Three Physicotheological Discourses" which were afterwards so well received by the public  At the period when Mr RAY turned his attention to the study of nature the knowledge of plants was not highly superior to the state in which TURNER had found it in the same place more than a century before In this study RAY could find no master I am not able to say that a single publication of a scientific nature on the subject of plants had ever appeared at  Cambridge  for  Maplet  's "Green Forest" will scarcely be thought worthy of that appellation  Oxford  had indeed not only experienced the benefit of private encouragement but of public munificence in the establishment of a Garden But at the sister university Mr RAY stood alone himself indeed an host Selftaught as he was and full of ardour he so forcibly displayed the utility of botanical knowledge and its intimate connection with the arts and conveniences  of life independent even of those charms which the views of nature ever afford to contemplative minds that he soon made it an object of attention and numbered among his associates in these studies Mr NID a senior fellow of his own college Mr  Francis  WILLUGHBY and Mr  Peter  COURTHOPE The first of these gentlemen became his inseparable companion but he had the misfortune to deplore his death a little time before the publication of his first work which came out under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM CIRCA CANTABRIGIAM NASCENTIUM"  Cantab  " pp  cum Indicibus  c pp  o    This little volume contains all the plants which the author had observed spontaneously growing in the neighbourhood of  Cambridge  amounting to all varieties and dubious plants excluded The number is small when compared with many modern catalogues but not so when it is recollected that at that period a very few of the  Cryptogamia  class and not many of  the  Graminaceous  tribe had been investigated  The plants are disposed in the alphabetical order of the  Latin  names and the synonyms of the four principal authors then in use given at length These are GERARD and PARKINSON and the two BAUHINES nor are others wanting when characteristic of the plant Prefixed is a list of the authors so accurately and instructively drawn up as not to have lost its utility to this day Mr RAY has interspersed many select observations on the medicinal and oeconomical uses of the plants on the structure of the flower on varieties and has not only described some new plants discovered by himself but given accurate distinctions of many before imperfectly known Subjoined the reader finds an index of the  English  names preceding the  Latin  an index specifying the particular places of the more rare plants then a copious etymology of the names and an explanation of the terms used in the science In fine he has done every thing to facilitate the labour  of the student in this part as in the former to instruct and entertain the more erudite reader  I have been the more diffuse on this small volume as the author has observed nearly the same plan in his subsequent catalogues and SYNOPSIS  Moles parva Vis magna  When the time in which this publication was made and the meagre structure of preceding catalogues is considered I may safely appeal to modern judges whether this was not an extraordinary production Few local catalogues had been published at home and I believe not one abroad that displayed any thing like a comparable share of science and erudition so aptly united  Among the variety of notes in this catalogue there is one possibly not of public notoriety Mr RAY informs us that the people of  Norwich  had long excelled in the culture and production of fine flowers and that in those days the florists held their annual feasts and crowned the best flower with a premium as at present  There can be no doubt that this volume met with the most favourable reception  from the learned in this way that it promoted the study of plants and by raising the reputation of its author encouraged him to prosecute his studies with vigour  These occupations however did not divert Mr RAY from his object of entering into the ministry He was in Dec ordained both deacon and priest by Dr  Sanderson  bishop of  Lincoln  and continued fellow of  Trinity College  till the Bartholomew act which as he did not subscribe necessarily superseded him This event took place Sept  The desire Mr RAY had to extend his knowledge of  English  botany had induced him in the autumn of to take a journey which he performed alone through the midland counties of  England  and the northern part of  Wales  in search of plants This tour held him from August to September Of this and of two other tours Mr RAY preserved some short memorandums in which he has noticed his daily progress some remarkable facts that occurred some observations on the antiquities that he met with and some of the rare  plants Dr SCOTT has published these  Itineraries  with his life  In his subsequent journies he was commonly accompanied by some friends of a congenial taste thus in his second tour in the autumn of Mr WILLUGHBY and some other gentlemen travelled with Mr RAY into  Scotland  through the counties of  Durham  and  Northumberland  to  Edinburgh Glasgow  and back through  Cumberland  and  Westmorland  This journey held six weeks from July to August In Mr RAY accompanied by Mr WILLUGHBY took his third and most extensive  English  tour through the middle counties of  England  into  Cheshire  thence into  North Wales  and through the middle  Welch  counties into  Pembrokeshire  coasting the southern part to  Bath  and  Bristol  thence to the  Land's End  through  Somerset  and  Devon  returning through  Dorsetshire Wiltshire  and  Hampshire  They were absent in this excursion from May to July and Mr RAY gathered a plentiful harvest which afterwards enabled him to enrich his general "Catalogue of  English  Plants"  then in meditation nor did he omit to avail himself of every opportunity particularly at  Tenby  in  Wales  and in  Cornwall  of describing such birds and fishes as were less frequent in other parts preparatory to his intended publications in the zoological way  In he published an  Appendix  to the "Cambridge Catalogue" containing emendations and the addition of fortytwo plants And in came out another  Appendix  with the addition of sixty more not noticed before which were principally communicated by Mr DENT of  Cambridge  These little tracts are become very scarce Those who are curious to see what these additional plants were may find them distinguished from the others in Professor MARTYN's "  Plantae Cantabrigienses  "  Being now at liberty from the constraints and business of a college life he was led to accompany Mr WILLUGHBY Mr SKIPPON and Mr  Nathaniel  BACON two of them his pupils to the continent Mr RAY was absent from April to March during which time they  visited  France Holland Germany Switzerland Italy  and extended their journey to  Sicily  and to  Malta  The fruit of this expedition will afterwards appear  On his return from the continent he spent the summer of between his friends in  Essex  and  Sussex  and in reading the publications which had appeared in  England  during the three years of his absence The winter passed in reviewing and arranging the museum of his friend and pupil Mr WILLUGHBY rich in animal and fossil productions in arranging his own catalogues for his general list of  English  vegetables and in framing the tables for Dr WILKINS's "Real or Universal Character"  In the summer of Mr RAY accompanied by his muchhonoured friend Mr WILLUGHBY made his fourth excursion into the distant counties They left  Middleton Park  on June and took their route to the  Land's End  through the counties of  Worcester Gloucester  and  Somerset  and returned through  Hants  to  London  on September In this journey besides the  pointed objects of their pursuit they took notes on the mines and smelting and on the method of making salt and Mr RAY did not omit to make as he had done before ample additions for his collections of proverbs and of local  English  words  On Nov of this year he was chosen fellow of the Royal Society and was prevailed on by Bishop WILKINS to translate his "Real Character" into  Latin  This he performed though it was never published and the manuscript is extant in the library of the Royal Society The latter end of the year and the beginning of he spent with gentlemen who had all been his pupils at Trinity Mr BURREL and Mr COURTHOPE at  Danny  in  Sussex  Sir  Robert  BARNHAM at  Bocton  in  Kent  and with Mr WILLUGHBY in  Warwickshire  In the autumn of this year he took his fifth journey alone into  Yorkshire  and  Westmorland  returning in September to  Middleton Hall  and spent the winter with Mr WILLUGHBY then lately married  CHAP  Account of  Ray  continuedMakes experiments on the motion of the sap  Catalogus Plantarum Angliae  Sixth tour in  England  Decease of his friend  Mr Willughby  and of  Bp WilkinsNomenclator Classicus  His marriage  His Observations topographical and moral  c made in his foreign travels with the  Catalogus Stirpium Exoticarum  annexed  RAY  ABOUT this time Dr TONGE Dr BEAL and some other philosophical gentlemen in  England  were busied in experiments relating to the motion of the sap in trees Among these also in the spring of Mr RAY and Mr WILLUGHBY entered upon a set of the like experiments and induced Mr afterwards Dr LISTER to prosecute the same These experiments were made on the birch the sycamore or greater maple the alder the ash the hasel chesnut walnut and willow of which the two first  were found to be the best adapted to the purpose from their bleeding most freely  The experiments of Mr RAY and Mr WILLUGHBY which were printed in the fourth volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  proved the ascent and descent as well as the lateral course of the sap but these gentlemen declined giving any decisive opinion as to a real circulation upwards by the vessels of the wood and downwards by those between the wood and the bark which was the doctrine maintained soon after this time by GREW and MALPHIGI and indeed afterwards adopted by Mr RAY himself  This doctrine of the circulation of the sap I need scarcely remark gave way to the experiments of Dr HALES and others which teaches that the sap rises and falls in the same system of vessels as it is affected by the joint operations of air and warmth Yet there have not been wanting ingenious men of late years also who conceiving the analogy between animals and vegetables to be greater than is usually imagined and even that plants not only live but feel have  advanced it as still probable that there is a real circulation of the juices the  succus communis  rising from the roots and the  succus proprius  descending towards them Whether these physiologies will yield to the  prolepsis plantarum  of the LINNAEAN school time must evince  When Mr RAY was at  Chester  in he availed himself of an opportunity of viewing a young porpess and of attending the dissection of it Of the anatomical structure of this animal he communicated a circumstantial account to the R S in and it was printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  and  In Mr RAY wrote a paper printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  on the subject of "Spontaneous Generation" a point of philosophy which had been much discussed and to which some among the learned were yet attached It appears from this paper that he very early rejected this doctrine and was confirmed in his opinion by the experiments of REDI  We are now to reap the fruit of Mr RAY's repeated journies into the various  parts of  England  taken with a professed view to ascertain the  loci natales  of all the native plants more accurately than had yet been done to investigate the more rare and perchance to discover new ones In each of these departments he had proved successful and in this year drew up his "Catalogue" and dedicated it to his friend and Maecenas Mr WILLUGHBY under the following title "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM ANGLIAE  et insularum adjacentium tum indigenas tum in agris passim cultas complectens  "  Lond  pp  o    This work is modelled after the  Cambridge  Catalogue in general as to the order of the subject except that the author has been much more sparing of the synonyms from all authors but the four classial writers GERARD PARKINSON and the two BAUHINES Several new plants are described in this volume and many doubtful ones discriminated with that critical accuracy which so singularly marked his pen and which had not before been seen in any  English  writer  Hitherto the  cryptogamous  and  graminaceous  tribe had engaged but little attention and in this volume these classes do not far exceed the number registered in the  Cambridge  Catalogue The whole number of plants in this list amount to about only This small number had been owing to the extreme caution of Mr RAY not to admit any varieties to hold the place of species and to exclude all others on doubtful authority How in his "  Phytologia  " has upwards of and MERRETT in his "  Pinax  " upwards of certain proofs that the authors had not sufficiently studied the nicer distinctions which guided the judgment of Mr RAY and as a proof it may be observed that many of their plants are to this day undiscovered Sensible as Mr RAY was of the errors of MERRETT's "  Pinax  " he purposely omitted quoting it as he writes to Dr LISTER that he might avoid that censure of it which could not properly have been withheld had he given his impartial opinion of that performance  In this year he informs Dr LISTER that he had what he thought a most liberal offer of one hundred pounds a year and  all his expences defrayed to accompany three young gentlemen abroad But he declined it although he much wished to have taken a review of the alpine plants Indisposition had some share in this refusal and we find that in the next spring he suffered much from a jaundice He was so far recovered however before  July  as to be able to set off on his sixth journey in which he took with him  Thomas  WILLISEL an unlettered man but one whose love for plants and his zeal and assiduity in collecting them merits commemoration They travelled through  Derbyshire Yorkshire  and all the northern counties as far as to  Berwick  and back through the bishoprick of  Durham  In the same year died to the unspeakable loss and grief of Mr RAY his most valuable friend  Francis  WILLUGHBY  Esq  on  July  d in the th year of his age The strictest intimacy had subsisted between them from the time of their being fellow collegians and it was cemented by a congeniality of taste which not unfrequently forms a stronger bond of union than the  ties of blood Mr WILLUGHBY had imbibed very early a strong taste for the study of the animal kingdom and had made extraordinary collections for compleating the "History of Birds and Fishes" in which he had ever been assisted by his friend Mr RAY who experienced his high attachment and confidence in being left one of his executors and charged with the education of his two sons the eldest of whom was not four years of age To this care he liberally annexed an annuity of sixty pounds per annum for life which was ever regularly paid  Immediately after this melancholy event he desisted from journeying again into the western counties as he had intended and refused an invitation from Dr LISTER to live with him at  York  in order to give himself up to the faithful discharge of his trust  For the use of these young gentlemen Mr RAY drew up in his  Nomenclator Classicus  induced thereto by observing the multitude of errors in the names of plants and animals in the manuals of daily use This compilation had authority  enough to recommend itself to subsequent writers of dictionaries and lexicons and has been reprinted several times  On  November  th he sustained in the death of Bishop WILKINS the loss of another of his best friends For this candid ingenious and learned man he had a sincere esteem and veneration  In the lot of human life such chasms are not easily filled up after the age of fortyfive It is however not unreasonable to conjecture that these privations added strength to his motives for domestic retirement and accelerated at least that connexion he made the next year when he married Margaret the daughter of Mr  John Oakely  of  Launton  in  Oxfordshire  They were married in the church of  Middleton  on  June  the th  In the same year Mr RAY gave to the public the fruit of his foreign travels under the title of "Observations topographical moral and physiological made in a journey through part of the Low Countries  Germany Italy  and  France  "  London    o  pp  The great object of accompanying his  three associates in this tour was the enlargement of his knowledge in natural history and particularly in the vegetable kingdom and the great number of plants observed and collected by him exceeded as he informs us his expectation not that any opportunities escaped him of describing the birds and fishes of the several countries they passed through in aid of Mr WILLUGHBY's plans His notes concerning those of  Germany  were unfortunately lost The volume before us however is by no means confined to natural history Mr RAY treats on the manners of the people and expatiates often on the excellencies and defects of the several governments particularly of the cities on the continent and on the state of the academies and universities He does not omit to notice the antiquities that occurred and of those at  Rome  he gives a very methodical account Besides many miscellaneous remarks on various other parts of natural history he has taken occasion to make a digression which at that time must have been of a very interesting nature on the most remarkable places  where petrified shells and figured fossils are found both in  England  and elsewhere and on the various opinions of authors relating to the origin of these bodies He freely declares his sentiments that they are the remains of onceorganized bodies in opposition to those who imagined them to be the product of what they called a  plastic  power He afterwards confirms his positions by additional arguments recited in a letter to Dr ROBINSON See  Letters  p  In the course of their journey he every where notices those plants that are not natives of  England  and gives copious catalogues of them They spent in the whole six months at  Geneva  which gave Mr RAY an opportunity of informing himself largely relating to the plants of  Switzerland  particularly those of Mount  Saleve  the  Dole  and of Mount  Jura  He even discovered some that were unknown to the preceding botanists although these were the regions of GESNER and the BAUHINES  The celebrated HALLER even ranks  him among those who made large accessions to the Botany of that country and gives the strongest testimony of his skill fidelity and judgment in discriminating describing and extricating the plants of that fruitful region  To the end of these "Observations" is affixed an alphabetical list of the plants mentioned in the body of the book under the title of "CATALOGUS STIRPIUM IN EXTERIS REGIONIBUS  à nobis observatarum quae vel omnino vel parcè admodum in Anglia sponte proveniunt  " pp  In the arrangement he cites the same authors for synonyms as in his preceding catalogues and occasionally introduces observations

RAY  THE talents of Mr RAY were not confined to natural history He had a relish among other departments of literature for philological enquiries and the genius of the  English  language had engaged much of his attention Of his pursuits in this way he has left memorials which have extended his reputation beyond the sphere of natural history and made him known to the learned world in general  I refer to his "Collection of  English  Proverbs" and to his "Collection of  English  Words" The foundation of these publications was laid in his various tours through the different parts of  England  His "Proverbs" were finished for the press in but not published till and a second edition much enlarged in under the following title "A COLLECTION OF ENGLISH PROVERBS digested into a convenient method for the speedy finding one upon occasion with short annotations Whereunto are added local proverbs with their explications old proverbial rhythmes less known or exotic proverbial sentences and  Scottish  proverbs Enlarged by the addition of many hundred  English  and an appendix of  Hebrew  proverbs with annotations and parallels"  Cambridge    o  pp  It has been reprinted many times and I think so lately as in the year  To collect these sententious maxims of knowledge both of a moral prudential and even a jocular nature has not been deemed unworthy employment by men of eminent learning and intelligence The Adagies of ERASMUS furnish a sufficient  example of the estimation he gave them They were an oral and traditionary kind of didactics which bore a greater value before the diffusion of knowledge by the use of printing and in oriental countries are still a favourite and usual mode of instruction  Of such as have been handed down in  Britain  from father to son through numerous generations Mr RAY's collection contains an ample store It is I believe the principal in its way and the author has interspersed many notes which illustrate the origin and sense of these aphoristic lessons and throw no small light on the manners and customs of various people  In was published his "COLLECTION OF ENGLISH WORDS not generally used with their significations and original in two alphabetical catalogues one of the northern and the other of the southern counties To which is added an account of the preparing and refining such metals and minerals as are gotten in  England  "  London    o    This little volume is dedicated to his friend Mr COURTHOPE at whose suggestion  he tells us it was undertaken and who contributed largely to augment it In the first edition was a catalogue of the  English  birds and fishes but this was omitted in a subsequent improved and enlarged edition in Mr RAY having then projected his "  Synopsis Animalium  "  This is one of those philological collections which tends to amuse and gratify general curiosity is of use not only to strangers and those who travel but to those who stay much at home while it contributes to enlarge the extent and illustrate the construction of the  English  tongue Mr  Thoresby  of  Leeds  sent to Mr  Ray  a large addition to this list in the year which was printed in his "Philosophical Letters" by Dr  Derham  In he communicated to the  Royal Society  some experiments made I believe by Mr WILLUGHBY accompanied with his own observations tending to ascertain the true use of the  airbladder  in fishes They are such as the present physiology of fishes have confirmed and were printed in the Philosophical Transactions N  o    In the year his "Catalogue of  English  plants" being out of print he gave another edition augmented with new observations and the addition of species of the more perfect plants and  funguses  several of these were new discoveries He here also gives the figures of the  pentaphylloides fruticosa potentilla fruticosa Lin  and the  fungus phalloides phallus impudicus Lin  Mr RAY continued after his marriage to reside at  Middleton Hall  where his engagements at this period of his life were such as called forth all the talents of his literary abilities and demanded all his care as a faithful guardian He was employed in a double duty that of his trust to the sons of his late estimable friend and of editor to the remains of their father "On the History of Birds and Fishes" The  Ornithology  was first published to which as it consisted of loose papers written in  Latin  and in an undigested state Mr RAY gave method and supplied from his own observations a large share of valuable materials It was published under the following title "ORNITHOLOGIAE LIBRI TRES  in quibus  Aves omnes hactenus cognitae in methodum naturis suis convenientem redactae accuratè describuntur Iconibus elegantissimis et vivarum avium simillimis aeri incisis illustrantur Totum opus recognovit digessit supplevit Johannes  RAIUS"  Lond  fol pp t f  Mr RAY translated this work into  English  and published it with large additions in with figures engraved at the expence of Mrs WILLUGHBY The execution of the figures was wholly inadequate to the merit of the work These occupations however did not prevent him from renewing a correspondence with Mr OLDENBURGH secretary of the Royal Society a learned German who after having resided some time at  Oxford  had been chosen into that office at the first establishment of the society Mr RAY in the year was induced to engage at the request of the society with other distant members to furnish observations on the subjects of natural history to be read at their meetings the society notwithstanding the extreme diligence of the secretary and some few  others being at this juncture rather in a languishing state  On this occasion he wrote several papers of which some were afterwards printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  Among those which were not published as we find by his letters were the following "On the Acid of Ants On a Fossil of the figured Kind found in  Malta  and known by the name of St  Paul's Bastoons Letters  p On the  Trochites  On Mushrooms On the Darting of Spiders On the Seeds of Plants and on the specific Differences of Plants"  On the death of the mother of his friend the Dowager Lady WILLUGHBY and the removal of his sons from under Mr RAY's tuition he retired some time in the year to  Sutton Cofield  about four miles distant from  Middleton Hall  where he remained till Michaelmas He then made a second removal to  Falkborne Hall  near  Black Notley  at which last place he built a house and finally settled  June    Mr WILLUGHBY's  Icthyology  remaining  yet unpublished Mr RAY in arranged the materials which had been left in a very imperfect and indigested state Perhaps no one but Mr RAY could have fulfilled this posthumous office certainly no man so effectually since Mr RAY had not only himself entirely furnished Mr WILLUGHBY with many but even the remainder had chiefly been collected during their almost daily intercourse and whilst travelling together  He wrote the two first books himself revised methodised and enlarged the whole and sent it to the Royal Society the members of which contributed to furnish the plates and by the assistance of Bishop FELL it was printed at  Oxford  the Royal Society being at the whole expence It came out under the following title  "  Francisci  WILLOUGHBEII  Armig De  HISTORIA PISCIUM LIBRI  quatuor jussu et sumptu  S RAY  Lond editi Totum opus recognovit coaptavit supplevit librum etiam primum et secundum integros adjecit  J RAIUS" Oxon fol pp  CHAP  Account of Mr  Ray  continuedMeditates the writing of his  General History of PlantsMethodus Plantarum  as introductory to that workTwo first volumes of the  History  in which are described near seven thousand plants  Fasciculus Stirpium  First edition of the  Synopsis Stirpium Britannicarum  RAY  MR RAY being settled at  Black Notley  and delivered from that anxiety which had attended him since Mr WILLUGHBY's death resumed with great vigour his wonted study of plants and having already acquired a reputation that justified any expectation his friends might have formed he in compliance with their wishes attached himself seriously to write "A General History of Plants"  Preparatory to this great work which he intended to arrange systematically he put forth in his "METHODUS PLANTARUM" enlarged and improved from the  synoptical tables which he had printed in Bishop WILKINS's "Real Character" in It bears the following title  "METHODUS PLANTARUM NOVA  brevitatis et perspicuitatis causâ synoptice in tabulis exhibita cum notis Generum tum summorum tum subalternorum characteristicis Observationibus nonnullis de seminibus Plantarum et indice copioso  " Lond  o  pp  LINNAEUS on what authority I know not mentions an edition of this work with the date of totally separate from that of but as that is earlier than Bishop WILKINS's Table it is probably a mistake  The first principle of Mr RAY in this work is to preserve all plants together as far as possible in the natural characters arising from conformity in the fructification and in the general habit Hence arose with him in common as with others too great a neglect of the flower and too much attention to the leaves He adheres to the ancient division of the vegetable kingdom into trees shrubs and herbaceous plants  ranking however with the latter such as had been called  Suffrutices  or shrubby  Trees  he divides into nine classes accounting the last anomalous  Shrubs  into six and  Herbs  into fortyseven  In the progress of his improvements afterwards he reduced these classes to thirtythree His method which is indeed extremely elaborate will best be seen by a view of the classes It will however be but justice to refer the account to the last edition that it may appear in the greatest perfection which he gave it  To this book Mr RAY has subjoined a clear concise view and a synoptical table of the system of CAESALPINE and gives his reasons for not adopting it although he candidly confesses his obligations to the author whom he acknowledges to be the parent of system  In and Mr RAY and Dr  Tancred  ROBINSON exchanged several letters while the latter was on a foreign tour relating to various undetermined facts in natural history among which it had been difficult to settle the exact species of the  Macruse  a bird allowed by the Roman Catholics to be eaten in Lent Their observations relating to this particular were published in the  Phil Trans  for in No It proved to be the  Scoter  or  Anas nigra Linnaei  We are now come to that performance which LINNAEUS and HALLER so justly stile  Opus immensi laboris  and which considered as the work of one man has perhaps been exceeded by none unless indeed by that of  John  BAUHINE who however did not live to put the finishing hand to his labour  Mr RAY informs us that it was at the persuasion of his friend Mr WILLUGHBY that he began to collect materials with a view to a General History of Plants But that after the loss of his friend in he relaxed and on hearing that Dr MORISON was employed on a similar design from which considerable expectations were formed at length gave up his purpose On the decease of Dr MORISON in who left the much greater part of his work unfinished by the persuasion of his friends  and particularly of Mr HOTTON to whom it was dedicated he resumed his design and prosecuted the work with vigour We cannot sufficiently admire the wonderful assiduity and address of this great man which enabled him in four years to collect such a stock of matter as to furnish two folio volumes of near one thousand pages each It even does not appear that he had the assistance of an amanuensis in this labour which he effected however with a skill and judgment that gained him the applause of all succeeding masters in the science  This important undertaking was intended by the author to comprehend the whole botany of the age by describing separately and reducing to his own system all the plants of the BAUHINES and of those who had enlarged the stock by subsequent discoveries These at the publication of RAY's first volume were the plants of  Mexico  from HERNANDEZ those of  Brasil  from PISO and MARCGRAAVE and of the  East Indies  from BONTIUS The rare plants of  Italy  from ZANONI the new plants of MORISON BREYNIUS and MENTZEL  The  Sicilian  plants of BOCCONE but above all the vast treasure of the six first volumes of the HORTUS MALABARICUS with many from works of lesser note  After prefixing an instructive list of the writings of near an hundred botanical authors quoted by him in the body of the book and giving an explanation of terms there follows a very comprehensive account of the philosophy of vegetables in which the anatomy and physiology of plants from MALPHIGI from GREW and from his own experiments the differences of the parts of vegetables from JUNGIUS and others are explained and illustrated with that judgment and knowledge of the subject and with that conciseness and methodical accuracy which I believe had rarely if ever been equalled by preceding writers This has rendered the introduction to his History a choice compendium of all that was valuable in the science of his day nor is the information it conveys so far superseded by any subsequent discoveries as to render it even now an uninteresting tract It is not easy to refer the modern student to a  more perfect view of the state of this science near the close of the last century than will here be found while the work itself exhibits the great improvement it had received since the beginning of the same period and to which the author had himself contributed in an eminent degree  The first volume was published in the year under the following title "HISTORIA PLANTARUM GENERALIS  species hactenus editas aliasque insuper multas noviter inventas et descriptas complectens in qua agitur primò de plantis in genere earumque partibus accidentibus et differentiis▪ deinde genera omnia tum

indicibus necessariis nominum morborum et remediorum  " Folio Vol I pp Vol II pp  preter indices    In the general arrangement of the subject according to his own system he has in various instances improved the classes At the head of each book or class is prefixed a synoptical table of all the chapters or  genera  In the particular disposition after prefixing to each chapter the etymology of the generical name he gives the character of the  genus  and in the enumeration of the species quotes at length the synonyms of  Caspar  BAUHINE from his "  Pinax  " and those of  John  BAUHINE GERARD and PARKINSON from their respective histories seldom introducing others where the plant was known to any of these writers  His descriptions of the old plants are taken from the abovementioned authors They are commonly abridged however and in numberless instances amended from his own knowledge of the plants He fails not to notice from whom they are taken and has every where distinguished the  British  plants from the exotics He has carefully marked all such as he had not had an opportunity of inspecting himself He adds the places of  growth and times of flowering and subjoins select observations from the most respectable authorities relating to the qualities and various uses of them  In the "History of Trees" the nobler and more capital parts of the vegetable kingdom as being dignified by the variety of their uses in human oeconomy he has extended his researches and collected with much assiduity a greater variety of interesting particulars Mr RAY has purposely avoided entering into nice and critical disquisitions relating to the species for besides that this would have swelled his work to an enormous bulk it was become less necessary after the descriptions given by  John  BAUHINE CLUSIUS and others so much superior to those of their predecessors and the more curious and critical examiner might be referred to these authors for ample scope to his curiosity  Mr RAY has described in these volumes about plants including however in this number many which modern botanists have since considered as varieties  The  Addenda  to the second volume contain several interesting catalogues such are those of ZANONI's History consisting of new  Italian Swiss  and  Milanese  plants those of BREYNIUS a catalogue of the plants of  Virginia  observed by Mr BANISTER and a compend of those of  Mexico  from HERNANDEZ who at the expence of sixty thousand ducats had procured the paintings of species which perished in a fire of the Escurial  In the preface to the first volume Mr RAY acknowledges his obligations for assistance received from many of his friends Among those who had more essentially contributed to enrich his work were Sir  Edward  HULSE Dr  Tancred  ROBINSON Dr SLOANE and his near neighbour Mr DALE To these he adds in the second volume the names of  William  COURTINE  Esq  of the Middle Temple Dr PLUKENET Mr DOODY and Mr PETIVER  There are copies of RAY's History with the date of but I believe the titlepage only to be new the remaining  copies of the impression by  Faithorne  falling into the hands of  Smith  and  Walford  about that time Foreign writers mention an edition so late as but this I suspect to be a mistake or owing to another transfer of the copies  After the first edition of the "  Catalogus Plantarum Angliae  " was out of print Mr RAY had been exhorted by his friend Dr  Ralph  JOHNSON to arrange the second according to system but not having sufficiently elaborated his method at that time he declined it and it came out in in the alphabetical order  A third edition being wanted however after the publication of the "History of Plants" he meditated throwing it into the systematic sorm and in the mean time put forth in "FASCICULUS STIRPIUM BRITANNICARUM  posl editum Plantarum Angliae Catalogum observatarum  " Lond  o  By this little volume a considerable accession was made to  English  botany several very rare mountainous or  Alpine  plants from  Wales  some scarce ones  from  Cornwall  sea plants new fungi mosses and grasses make their first appearance in this little catalogue  The "SYNOPSIS" although finished for the press soon after this "  Fasciculus  " was not published owing to the delay of the printer till when it appeared under this title "SYNOPSIS METHODICA STIRPIUM BRITANNICARUM  in qua tum notae generum characteristicae traduntur tum species singulae breviter describuntur    plus minus novae species partim suis locis inserantur partim in appendice seorsim exhibentur cum indice et virium epitome  "  o  pp  As Mr RAY had dedicated the "  Alphabetical Catalogue  " to his great friend and  Mecaenas Francis  WILLUGHBY  Esq  so he now shews the same respect to  Thomas  the only surviving son of his muchhonoured patron whom he exhorts to pursue the example of his excellent father and for whom he pours forth in the most energetic language all those ardent wishes which gratitude and respect for the memory of the father and love for the pupil could alone inspire  In the preface Mr RAY acknowledges the assistance he received from Mr BOBART superintendant of the garden

corrections and additions he held himself eminently obliged  The  Appendix  contains a list of scarce plants communicated by Mr BOBART some new plants by Mr SHERARD a list of those of  Jersey  by the same new and rare species with critical observations from Dr PLUKENET  musci  and rare plants by  Mr DOODY emendations and additions by Dr  Tancred  ROBINSON and a catalogue of thirtyfour species common both to  England  and  Jamaica  communicated by Dr SLOANE In this work Mr RAY has thrown the observations on the qualities and uses into the index  From this time the "SYNOPSIS" became the pocket companion of every  English  botanist It contributed not a little both to facilitate and improve the science It diffused the knowledge of system and by obliging those who wished for improvement to attend more minutely to generical characters led to a nicer discrimination of both  genera  and  species  CHAP  Account of  Ray  's works continued  Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the

SynopsisDe variis Plantarum MethodisEpistola ad Rivinum  His  Persuasive to a Holy Life  RAY  TO this period Mr RAY had appeared to the public principally as a naturalist but he now united to this character that of the theologist It is needless to say that he succeeded in this department perhaps beyond most of those who had before written on the same subject His first publication of this kind we are told was  originally and in its outlines  College Exercises  only or  Common Places  These he now wrought up and enlarged into a convenient volume and trusted it to the care of his friend Dr  Tancred  ROBINSON who procured five hundred copies to be printed under the following title "THE WISDOM OF GOD MANIFESTED IN THE WORKS OF THE CREATION"  o  It was reprinted the next year The eleventh edition was published in and a twelfth in and I believe several times since and it has been translated into foreign languages These are sufficient testimonies of the esteem with which it was received by the public  It is not immediately within my plan to enlarge on this work or to determine whether the arguments  à priori  or  à posteriori  are best calculated to obtain the object of it "Demonstration of the Being of a God" "  Qui historiam naturae naturae etiam Creatorem colit  " I may be allowed to observe that Mr RAY from that comprehensive view of nature which his mind embraced was singularly well qualified to display the manifold  wonders of the creation and the wisdom of its omnipotent Author And thus while his penetrating views enabled him to unfold the various oeconomy and evolutions of nature to the greatest advantage his piety and humility give a force to his reasonings and deductions that carries with it a conviction of that great truth he so sincerely wished to inculcate  The favourable acceptance the public gave to the "Demonstration" encouraged Mr RAY to publish the next year his "THREE PHYSICOTHEOLOGICAL DISCOURSES concerning the primitive Chaos and Creation of the World The general Deluge its causes and effects The Dissolution of the World and future Conflagration"  o  and pp It is embellished with a plate of the  Apamaean  medal and three tables of figured fossils and is dedicated to Archbishop TILLOTSON  This work is a convincing proof of the extensive reading the various erudition and multifarious knowledge of this great and good man Independent of all the theories  it contains this volume exhibits such an assemblage of facts relating to the structure of this globe to the changes it has undergone and to the history of figured fossils that it may be read to advantage even in this age of advanced curiosity and knowledge in the professed object of this book Even the fastidious critic who is versed in all the more modern theories down to the "Epochas of Nature" and those of  M De  LUC and  De  SOULAVIE will allow that this volume when respect is had to the time of its publication must have conveyed a large share of intelligence to those who were capable of gratification from disquisitions of this nature and that with a deference to the opinions of the day there is yet a freedom of enquiry that distinguishes the author as a friend to true philosophy and as a modest and candid enquirer after truth in those points of natural history which still continue and probably long will to be involved in great obscurity  In this year Mr RAY wrote some "Observations on the Planting of  Maize  instead of  Pease  " occasioned by a proposal  of Sir  Richard  BULKLEY in which he says that he had found the greatest yield of pease to be twenty barrels reaped for one sown whereas from one grain of  Indian wheat  he had calculated the produce would be upwards of grains for one These Observations were printed in the  Phil Trans  N  o  Mr RAY was not sanguine in his expectations from the culture of that grain neither have subsequent trials proved the utility of it in this climate  The botanical labours of this eminent man were now remitted at least for some time and we find that after the publication of his "  History  " and the "  Synopsis  " his exertions were turned into another channel in which he also stood unrivalled in his day It was not botany alone that he raised from a drooping state to zoology considered as a science he might be said to have given birth in these kingdoms since except what himself and Mr WILLUGHBY had performed nothing of importance on the history of animals existed  TOPSELL's "Abridgment of GESNER"  MOFFAT's "Book on Insects" and the short and imperfect essays of CHARLETON in his "  Onomasticon  " and of MERRET in his "  Pinax  " were almost the only  English  writers to be consulted To assert that better helps were wanted is not to injure or to degrade those authors Mr RAY had been urged by his friends and particularly by Dr ROBINSON to undertake an entire FAUNA ANGLICA and a history of  Fossils  also but age and infirmities began now to oppress him and he thought himself inadequate to the attempt He lived however to perform more than his fears or his humility permitted him to hope  In he published his "SYNOPSIS METHODICA ANIMALIUM QUADRUPEDUM  et  SERPENTINI GENERIS  vulgarium notas characteristicas rariorum descriptiones integras exhibens cum historiis et observationibus anatomicis perquam curiosis Praemittuntur nonnulla de animalium in genere sensu generatione divisione c  " Lond  o  pp  In this volume we see the first truly systematic arrangement of animals since the days of ARISTOTLE an arrangement which  his successors in the same line have equally applauded and availed themselves of It is professedly the basis of that method by which the present eminent zoologist of this nation has chosen to convey his learned publications and by which he has not less happily diffused a taste for this science than he has successfully improved its store  In treating on animals in general introductory to his work he discusses some important questions which had not then ceased to agitate the philosophical world He controverts with extreme force of reasoning the ideas of equivocal or spontaneous generation the  Lewenhoekian  hypothesis and that of all animals being created from eternity and only latent in an involved state I know not where the reader can see these questions discussed with equal conciseness and judgment united  Mr RAY's Distribution of Animals is not wholly founded as to the grand divisions on the  Aristotelian  distinctions though he admits many of them It is not within my plan to enter on this subject it is sufficient to observe that  Quadrupeds  here form two great  divisions as they are  boofed  or  digitated  the former as they are  whole  or cloven the latter as they are  divided  into more or fewer claws admitting also of subdivisions or  genera  from the number of the claws and in some from the consideration of the teeth  At the time when Mr RAY lived few people had acquired a taste for this kind of knowledge and commerce had not lent her friendly aid as in later times What animals came under his own inspection he has described with his accustomed accuracy from GESNER and ALDROVAND he borrows his descriptions of others and many later discovered subjects he drew from PISO and MARCGRAAVE from CLUSIUS HERNANDEZ LAET and NIEREMBERG  In the course of this work he has in various instances given the anatomical structure from Dr TYSON from the "  Parisian  Dissections" and other works Throughout the whole he has shewn how intimately he was acquainted with the learning of the ancients and particularly with ARISTOTLE  whom as the parent of zoological knowledge he failed not to consult on all occasions but by no means implicitly to follow in his subtleties and obscurities  On finishing the "Synopsis of Quadrupeds" Mr RAY immediately drew up that of the  Birds  and  Fishes  This was an easier task at this time since they are to be considered as compends of his preceding labours with his friend Mr WILLUGHBY although there were many things new in both and that of the Fishes was very greatly improved as to the arrangement and method He informs us that the additions were the  Mexican  birds from HERNANDEZ some descriptions of new species out of NIEUHOFF MARTIN's Birds and Fishes of  Greenland  SIBBALD's Whales SLOANE's  Jamaica  Birds and Fishes and some from the  Leyden  Catalogue by Dr ROBINSON  In these branches of nature Mr RAY again appears as the parent of method The accurate BRISSON regards RAY and WILLUGHBY as the first true systematic writers on birds These works were finished  in the year or as we learn from Mr RAY's letters and from the testimony of his friend and neighbour Mr DALE Yet excellent as they were so scanty was the taste for natural history at this period that the manuscripts lay unpublished in the booksellers hands till they were purchased by Mr INNYS and prepared for the press by Dr DERHAM who added the figures and inserted Mr BUCKLEY's Birds from  Madrass  and Mr JAGO's  Cornish  Fishes They were published in under the titles of "SYNOPSIS METHODICA AVIUM"  o  pp t and "SYNOPSIS METHODICA PISCIUM"  o  pp t  In the same year Mr RAY became the editor of a translation of "Dr RAUWOLF's Travels" This physician who was the next after BELON whom the love of natural history alone led to travel into the east spent the years in traversing  Syria Mesopotamia Palestine  and  Aegypt  induced as he tells us by his desire to behold in the native places the plants of the  Greek  and  Arabian  physicians  His "Travels" having been published in in the  German  language had hitherto been locked up from the  English  reader Sir  Hans  SLOANE having however read them was induced in concert with Capt HATTON to procure a translation of them which was done by  Nicholas  STAPHORST This version was put into Mr RAY's hands to revise and correct He did more he made a choice selection from other authors who had made the same tour BELON ALPINUS Sir  George  WHELER c and he drew up a Catalogue of the more rare Plants of those countries through which RAUWOLF travelled and added lists of those of  Aegypt  and  Crete  From this circumstance the book has gone by the name of "RAY's COLLECTION OF TRAVELS" and it was reprinted with his own "Observations" in RAUWOLF made an "  Herbarium  " while in the east which with his  European  plants constituted four large volumes These became the property of Queen  Christina  and afterwards by her means probably of  Isaac  VOSSIUS who informed  Capt HATTON that  l  sterling had been offered for them They were purchased of his heirs by the university of  Leyden  and the late Dr  Frederick  GRONOVIUS constructed from them an elegant and learned "  Flora Orientalis  " of which he much enhanced the value by prefixing to it  Melchier  ADAMS's "Life of RAUWOLF" with large additions of his own  The "CATALOGUS STIRPIUM IN EXTERIS REGIONIBUS OBSERVATARUM" being out of print Mr RAY was induced to give a new edition of it with such large augmentations as to make it a new work He added from CLUSIUS from the BAUHINES and other authors a number of plants growing in those regions through which he passed in his tour and so many catalogues from other authors as to render it a tolerably complete list of all the  European  plants not natives of  England  As it does not immediately respect  English  botany it will be sufficient to recite the titlepage from which its scope may be understood  "STIRPIUM EUROPAEARUM  extra Britannias  nascentium  SYLLOGE  Quas partim observavit ipse

collegit J  RAIUS  Adjiciuntur Catalogi rariorum Alpinarum et Pyrenaicarum Baldensium Hispanicarum Grisleii Graecarum et Orientalium Creticarum Aegyptiacarum aliique ab eodem  " Lond  o  pp  In the preface to this work Mr RAY for the first time entered into controversy having taken occasion to throw out some strictures on the method of botany published by RIVINUS in It is not enough interesting at this day to dwell on the nature of it It is sufficient to observe that our veteran in science was dissatisfied with the  German  for throwing the trees promiscuously into the classes with other plants and for breaking into the natural orders for the sake of agreement in the flower alone In fact RIVINUS's method being founded wholly on the flower to  which part RAY had paid but small regard the sources of controversy were endless since the fundamental principles of each were totally irreconcileable  About this time Mr RAY communicated "The Provincial Catalogues of Plants" printed at the end of each county in the edition of "CAMBDEN's  Britannia  " published in by Mr GIBSON His repeated travels throughout most parts of  England  for the sole purpose of investigating the subjects of nature had enabled him to accomplish more than had been done by any man before his time and his unquestionable skill and accuracy added an authenticity to these lists which could not easily have been derived from any other hand  To the county of  Cornwall  Mr RAY added many other particulars which however were not printed probably because the corresponding circumstances could not be procured from other counties These were "Catalogues of the Sea Fish and Sea Fowl with the synonyms" some account of two or three sorts of stone dug there of sea sand as manure an account of the  hurlers  and other stones and notices respecting the manners and language of the inhabitants  Such as are conversant with that science which was the favourite object of Mr RAY must be sensible that nothing could have happened more conducive to the revival and improvement of it at this juncture than the circumstance of its having been taken up by a man of such patient industry capable at the same time of giving it all the embellishments and advantages that learning could afford They will readily grant that his writings and example alone added more vigour and brought more disciples to this school of natural science in  England  than all the exertions of foregoing writers  I cannot confirm and illustrate the truth of this position more effectually than by calling to the attention of the curious in this kind of knowledge the vast augmentation it acquired in the interval between the publication of Mr RAY's "  Catalogus Plantarum Angliae  " and that of the "  Synopsis  " and more especially between the time of the first and second edition of the  latter work during which exclusive of the discovery of many subjects among what were called the  more perfect  plants a new and very extensive field had been opened by exciting attention to the  less perfect  as they were then accounted and minuter kinds of vegetables the  Fungi Fuci Musci  and  Algae  known now by the name of  Cryptogamiae  During the first of these periods species had been added to the  English Flora  and the accession in the last exceeded that number  In no part of  Europe  had the same progress been made in the investigation of these hitherto muchneglected subjects as in  England  during the period above mentioned This is sufficiently evinced by comparing the second edition of the "SYNOPSIS" with the contemporary writings of foreign botanists  This second edition of the "SYNOPSIS" was printed in  o  pp Mr RAY himself had but a small share in the augmentations that were made to this edition His advancing years and infirmities prevented him from making excursions His  principal auxiliaries are mentioned in the preface in which additional to the names in the former "SYNOPSIS" we meet with those of Mr  Edward  LLHWYD  Walter  MOYLE  Esq  and Mr  William  VERNON fellow of St  Peter  's College  Cambridge  To those who are sensible of the obligations which the science owes to Mr RAY it cannot but be grateful to read with what satisfaction the good man records in this preface the progress he had lived to see his favourite study make in his own country and with what delight he augurs and contemplates its future improvement In the space of little more than twenty years and under his own pen he had seen the  English Flora  acquire an accession of upwards of new subjects The "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM ANGLIAE" of containing about and the second edition of the "SYNOPSIS" in full species and notwithstanding these have not all stood the test of the discriminating character of the present age yet in justice to this great man and his associates it must be acknowledged  that the retrenchments are comparatively few  With this edition of the "SYNOPSIS" was published the "DISSERTATIO DE VARIIS PLANTARUM METHODIS BREVIS" in which Mr RAY shews that the separation of plants into classes and  genera  from the fructification alone must be a very gradual and progressive affair that it was not easy to exclude the habit from having a share in this distribution since there were many plants that were seldom or never seen in flower by the early botanists He also observes that numberless plants which agree in the structure of the flower differ materially in habit and others  vice versa  And although his own method is principally founded on the fruit yet he freely acknowledges its imperfections but thinks the same objections hold against the flower which he illustrates by shewing in TOURNEFORT's system the uncertainty of the bounds between the  Flores infundibuliformes hypocrateriformes  and the  caryophyllei  If Mr RAY paid less regard to the flower than its importance seemed to demand it seems rather to have arisen from  the principles of his method than from his want of opportunities of examination owing to his distance from botanical gardens as was alledged by his opponents a circumstance however which he very feelingly laments in the preface to his "METHODUS" and elsewhere  To this is annexed "EPISTOLA  de  METHODO PLANTARUM  viri clarissimi D A Q Rivini ad Raium cum ejusdem responsoria in qua D Jos Pitton Tournefortii M D Elementa Botanica tanguntur  "  On the method of RIVINUS Mr RAY as was before noticed had thrown out some strictures in the preface to his "  Sylloge  " which drew from that author the answer here published and Mr RAY's reply in which our author takes occasion also to defend his method from the objections of TOURNEFORT who had been unbecomingly severe in some animadversions made in the "  Elements of Botany  " published in TOURNEFORT however afterwards did ample justice to the merits of our author  The modern botanist sees that all these controversies are become too little interesting  to dwell upon at this time The principles of the  Corollistae  and the  Fructistae  as LINNAEUS styles them can never be assimilated and all attempts to reduce the whole vegetable kingdom into natural classes have hitherto failed  In he wrote "Some Observations on the Poisonous Effects of a Root eaten instead of Parsneps" supposed to have been that of the Hemlock but of which Mr RAY had some doubt alledging that it was more probably the  Cicutaria vulgaris Chaerophyllum sylvestre  Lin See  Phil Trans  N  o  In N  o  he communicated "Remarks on the Poisonous Effects of the  Oenanthe crocata  " too fatally confirmed by later mistakes of the same kind  In the year Mr RAY published "A PERSUASIVE TO A HOLY LIFE from the Happiness which attends it both in this World and in the World to come" Lond  o  Reprinted in pp He tells us it was drawn up at the request of his friend Mr  Edmund Elys  and that it is composed on the model of Bishop WILKINS's  "Treatise on Natural Religion" It is wholly of a moral and practical nature written in a plain but forcible and argumentative style and is entirely destitute of any of those enthusiastic or mystical opinions which so highly tinctured the writings of many divines of the last century On the contrary Mr RAY ever consistent and rational although he deduces his principal motives to the practice of virtue as conducive to happiness even in this life from the precepts of Christianity yet does not disdain particularly in treating on pleasure on riches and the advantages of temperance to enforce his arguments by opinions and apophthegms from the writings of the philosophers and moralists of ancient  Greece  and  Rome  CHAP  Account of  Ray  continuedImproved edition of the  Methodus Plantarum  Outlines of  Ray's  systemThird volume of the  Historia PlantarumMethodus Insectorum  His Death and Character  RAY  THE peaceable mind of Mr RAY could not delight in the contentious field of controversy on the contrary he regretted the occasions that drew him into it yet were they not without use since they unquestionably stimulated him to purify and correct his own  Methodus  This he effected in the year although at this time much declined in his health being afflicted with ulcers of the lower extremities the pain of which rendered his nights frequently sleepless and wholly prevented him from making excursions to  London  as he much desired to examine the gardens and  herbaria  of the curious  So small however was the demand for books in this science at the entrance of this century that the  London  booksellers were unwilling to risk the printing of it and it was finally sent to  Holland  and printed at  Amsterdam  under the care of Dr HOTTON the botanical professor at  Leyden  who supervised the press and procured copies to be thrown off under the title of "METHODUS PLANTARUM EMENDATA ET AUCTA  accedit Methodus Graminum Juncorum et Cyperorum specialis  "  o  pp Dr HOTTON gave a further sanction to the system of his friend he taught it in his lectures to the pupils of that university and informed Mr RAY of the good acceptance it met with on the continent particularly in  Italy  This volume was reprinted at  Amsterdam  in and at  Tubingen  in  In the preface he recapitulates his own progress in the formation of his system and dates it from the tables drawn up in for the use of Bishop WILKINS He very justly reprehends Dr MORISON for affecting to have formed his method entirely  from his own observations without acknowledging the smallest aid from former writers briefly recites his objections to the methods of RIVINUS TOURNEFORT and HERMAN and defends his own He establishes some axioms to be observed in framing a system of botany In fact Mr RAY's method though he assumes the fruit as the foundation is an elaborate attempt for that time to fix natural classes He establishes it as a rule that no plant is to be separated from its tribe for a single note of difference but that all are to be assimilated as far as habit will allow The characters of the  genera  are however highly incongruous they are taken from vague principles such as the shape of the leaf colour of the flower taste smell and sometimes from the size of the plant and other as unstable distinctions  In this amended edition Mr RAY still adheres to the ancient division into trees and herbaceous plants having dropped the distinction of shrubs preserved in the first edition Here all herbaceous and shrubbystalked plants are divided into twentyfive  genera  or classes as follow    Submarinae    Fungi  In the first  Methodus  these two classes were formed into one class or synoptical table    Musci    Capillares    Apetalae  Before in two tables    Planipetalae lactescentes    Discoideae  Before in two classes    Corymbiferae  Before in two classes    Capitatae  Before in two classes    Herbae semine nudo solitario flore simplici perfecto    Umbelliferae    Stellatae    Asperifoliae    Verticillatae  Before divided into two  Herbaceae et Fruticosae    Polyspermae  Formerly in two classes    Pomiferae    Bacciferae    Multisiliquae    Vasculiferae Monopetalae  Before in three classes  et Dipetalae    Siliquosae et Siliculosae  Formerly in three classes  et Anomalae    Papilionaceae s Leguminosae  Formerly in four classes    Pentapetalae  Before in two classes    Floriferae Graminifoliae  Formerly in four classes  et Bulbosis affines    Stamineae Graminifoliae  Before in three tables    Anomalae  Trees and Shrubs    Arundinaceae    Flore a fructu remoto seu Apetalae    Fructu umbilicato s Pomiferae et Bacciferae    Fructu non umbilicato s Pruniferae    Fructu sicco non siliquoso nec umbilicato et Miscellaneae    Siliquosae non Papilionaceae    Siliquosae Papilionaceae    Anomalae  At this time the consideration of Mr RAY's method is a matter of mere curiosity yet in justice to this great man it must be remarked that his system though less artificial than that of CAESALPINE is  much more highly elaborated than that of MORISON and though Mr RAY must have taken infinite pains with it yet is it difficult in practice since the bases of the classes are not uniform Of the thirtythree however twelve are nearly composed of natural orders Such are the following  Fungi  Musci  Capillares  Planipetalae  Umbelliferae  Stellatae  Asperifoliae  Verticillatae  Pomiferae  Siliquosae  Leguminosae  Culmiferae  The remaining classes are combined of subjects less connected by habit and structure and are therefore subject to more arbitrary rules drawn from the consideration of some one or more parts in the fructifition  In the "METHODUS  Graminum Juncorum et Cyperorum specialis  " annexed to this book Mr RAY's distribution rests principally on what may be called the habit of the fructification all those  genera  which  in the  Linnaean  system are known by the names of  Phalaris Alopecurus Dactylis Agrostis Aia Poa Briza  c being called  Gramen  simply with the epithets of the old authors annexed expressive of the mode of bearing the parts of the fructification whether in spikes or panicles as  Gramen triticeum Gramen loliaceum typhinum Gramen paniculatum miliaceum  c In this  Conspectus  however all the species are introduced to the amount of two hundred  Sixteen years had now elapsed since the publication of his "History of Plants" in which interval botany had assumed a new face and experienced a much greater revolution and accession than had ever taken place before System had been studied and in some measure established both at home and abroad An incredible number of new plants had been introduced from all parts of the world and cultivated with extreme care in the gardens of  Europe  In the mean time these circumstances had given rise to a great number of valuable publications The remaining six volumes of  that inestimable work the "HORTUS MALABARICUS" had appeared BREYNIUS HERMAN TOURNEFORT PLUMIER PLUKENET BOCCONE COMMELINE BOBART CUPANI VOLKAMER and RIVINUS had enriched botany with valuable performances These large augmentations to the science induced Mr RAY notwithstanding his advanced years and ill health to attempt a collection of these scattered materials in order to form a supplemental volume to his "History" and his industry enabled him to effect his purpose Additional to the assistances derived from all these printed works he had access by the favour of Sir  Hans  SLOANE to the MS of his "History of  Jamaica  Plants" of which the "  Prodromus  " had been published in with liberty to select what he thought proper to his design  From the same gentleman he enjoyed the benefit of an  Herbarium  of several hundred new and undescribed plants collected in  Maryland  by Mr VERNON and Mr KREIG who had made a voyage thither for the  sole purpose of gratifying their taste in botany Mr PETIVER freely communicated his stores at that time very ample though afterwards abundantly more so and Dr SHERARD engaged besides supplying more than a thousand species himself to take the trouble of inspecting the whole work before it went to the press and of making such corrections and additions as he judged proper  It was the last of his works published in his lifetime and came out in with the following title  "HISTORIAE PLANTARUM TOMUS TERTIUS  qui est  SUPPLEMENTUM  duorum praecedentium species omnes vel omissas vel post volumina illa evulgata editas praeter innumeras fere novas et indictas ab amicis communicatas complectens cum synonymis necessariis et usibus in cibo medicina et mechanicis  " Lond folio pp and the "  Dendrologia  " pp App pp  The distribution is the same as that of the two former volumes In a compilation of this kind collected from so numerous a set of authors and in many instances from dried and imperfect specimens there must  necessarily arise a multitude of repetitions The author was sufficiently aware of this but it was unavoidable In this volume there are upwards of plants enumerated  The Appendix contains several catalogues which must have been interesting to the curious at that time Father CAMELL a learned Jesuit of  Manila  who had not only described but delineated a great number of the plants of  Luzone  transmitted his work to Mr RAY and it forms an extensive part of this Appendix It must have been much regretted that the Rev Father had not been furnished with books to have enabled him to adapt the synonyms since there are few instances in which any other names occur than the  Spanish  and the indigenous appellations of the natives and  Malays  Mr RAY then gives a list of TOURNEFORT's oriental discoveries from the "  Corollarium  " those of DAMPIER from  New Holland  and elsewhere and of MARTENS's  Greenland  Plants of COMMELINE's Rare Exotics a copious Catalogue of  Chinese  Madrass  and  African  Plants communicated by Mr PETIVER of which those from  Madrass  had been collected by Mr BROWNE a surgeon at that settlement and lastly a list of the new or hitherto very imperfectly described species contained in Mr PETIVER's  Hortus Siccus  amounting to upwards of  An advertisement had been printed at the end of the first volume of Mr RAY's "History" in inviting to a subscription for a set of figures to the work and it was proposed that those belonging to each tribe or class should be published in regular succession but it did not succeed The scheme was again revived while the Supplement was printing and among other of Mr RAY's friends Dr COMPTON bishop of  London  had given his patronage and strongly recommended it Conferences were held with Dr SHERARD Sir  Hans  SLOANE Dr ROBINSON and Mr PETIVER relating to it but it was relinquished as impracticable  Mr RAY's infirmities were very pressing upon him during the later years of his life  In a letter written in the spring of he informs Mr DERHAM that he had not been half a mile from his own house for four years Yet under these circumstances he wrote his supplemental volume to his "History of Plants" which he says had engrossed almost his whole time for two years  We have now brought Mr RAY's botanical works to a conclusion but his labours did not cease here His active and indefatigable mind prompted him at the age of seventyfive to begin a work on  Insects  to which he had been encouraged by Dr DERHAM and for which he had been accumulating materials during many years This was intended to comprehend only the  English  species although at the same time his friends were wishing to engage him to describe the exotics of the  London Musea  which were then beginning to abound in these subjects  He had paid some attention to the history of  Spiders  indeed many years before when intimately connected with Dr  LISTER but the greater part of his work was drawn up from his own actual descriptions and partly from Mr WILLUGHBY's papers and the contributions of friends Mr PETIVER Mr DANDRIDGE Dr SLOANE Mr MORTON and Mr STONEFLEET  He tells us that in the later years of his life he had discovered kinds of  Papilios  diurnal and nocturnal and knew there were many more The  Beetles  he observes were as numerous and the  Flies  not less so I mention these circumstances to prove the extensive knowledge of nature which this extraordinary man possessed at an aera when he stood so nearly alone in these branches of science He did not live to finish this work It was published by Dr DERHAM in in  o  pp  I believe Mr RAY was the first who gave to these minuter animals a real and scientific distribution He had drawn up a short "METHODUS INSECTORUM" which was published the year after his death Of the history itself it is sufficient to say that it bears all the characters of that accurate  discriminating and systematic genius which guided him in all his researches in the field of nature and that it is every where quoted by the eminent  Swede  with the highest commendations for the faithful descriptions it contains  Mr RAY's infirmities and afflictions painful and grievous as they were did not we are told prevent him from prosecuting his studies till within about three months before his death which event took place on Jan  He died at  Black Notley  and was buried as Dr DERHAM says according to his own desire in the church of that parish The writers of the "General Dictionary" in the mean time inform us that  "although the rector of the parish offered him a place of interment in the chancel of the church yet he modestly refused it choosing rather to be buried in the churchyard with his ancestors where a monument was erected to him"  as Dr DERHAM relates at the charge of some of his friends with a  Latin  inscription which may be seen in the "General Dictionary" and in Mr SCOTT's  "Remains" and of which I insert a copy below  The Inscription on Mr RAY's Monument  Eruditissimi Viri JOHANNIS RAII MA  Quiequid mortale fuit  Hoc in angusto Tumulo reconditum est  At scripta  Non unica continet Regio  Et Fama undiquaque

monument beginning to want repair by standing exposed in the churchyard was removed and set up in the chancel of the church and to the epitaph is added on the table of the east side what follows  Hoc

RAY  Nat Nov  Ob Jan    As Mr RAY did not inherit any paternal estate and had often refused preferment his circumstances could never have been affluent and the legacy of Mr WILLUGHBY is said to have been the greatest part of what he enjoyed His own estate whatever that might be he settled on his wife  He had four daughters three of whom survived him  "He left a small legacy to the poor of his own parish and five pounds to Trinity College in  Cambridge  to purchase books for the library there All his collections of natural curiosities he  bestowed on his friend and neighbour Mr  Samuel  DALE author of the  Pharmacologia  to whom they were delivered about a week before his death"  Mr RAY's posthumous papers were entrusted  by his widow to the care of Dr DERHAM who after publishing the "HISTORIA INSECTORUM" selected a number of his letters and printed them in under the title of "PHILOSOPHICAL LETTERS between the learned Mr RAY and several of his Correspondents natives and foreigners"  o  pp  This collection contains letters of which sixtyeight were written by Mr RAY himself Among his correspondents the most frequent were Dr LISTER Sir  Philip  SKIPPON Dr  Tancred  ROBINSON Sir  Hans  SLOANE Mr LLWYD Mr JESSOP Mr JOHNSON and Mr OLDENBURGH The first of Mr RAY's letters bears date in the last in  The correspondence of learned and scientific men seldom fails to be a welcome present to those of similar literature and pursuits for besides the personal interest we take in their concerns they commonly delineate in the most faithful colours the characters of the writers frequently ascertain discoveries and enable their successors to trace the progress of knowledge in a  more interesting manner than by historical detail  As the general subject of these letters is natural history so botany bears a prevailing portion Besides numberless critical observations that occur on particular species we meet with a long catalogue of the rare plants of the north of  England  by Mr LAWSON Dr PLUKENET's Observations on the first edition of the "  Synopsis  " those of Dr PRESTON on various  British  Plants a paper of  Thomas  WILLISEL's specifying the different kinds of trees on which in his travels he had seen the  Misseltoe  growing and a list of such exotics as were thought rare at that time in the  Chelsea  Garden and at  Fulham  There is moreover among these letters an interesting paper written by Mr RAY himself in answer to the question  "What number of plants there are in the world"  in which he discusses the difficulty or impossibility of gaining satisfaction on this point arising from the want of sufficient bounds between species and variety He communicated to the Royal Society some  remarks on this head which were printed by Dr BIRCH in the third volume of the "History of the Royal Society"  Dr DERHAM meditated writing the life of Mr RAY but he appears not to have fully executed his plan His papers however were published by Mr SCOTT in under the title of "Select Remains of the learned  John  RAY"  o  pp To these are annexed three of the  Itineraries  which constitute the greater part of the book They are evidently short notes only never intended for the public eye Some of Mr RAY's devotional pieces accompany this collection and three letters to Dr DERHAM with a  Latin  letter of advice and instructions to his pupils the Mr WILLUGHBYS  There is said to be still extant a manuscript of Mr RAY's under the title of "  Catalogus Plantarum domesticarum quae aluntur Catabrigiae in hortis academicorum et oppidanorum  " In this he chiefly makes use of the  synonyma  of the two BAUHINES and of GERARD and PARKINSON  Mr RAY had the singular happiness of  devoting fifty years of his life to the cultivation of the sciences he loved Incited by the most ardent genius which overcame innumerable difficulties and discouragements his labours were in the end crowned with a success before almost unequalled He totally reformed the studies of botany and zoology he raised them to the dignity of a science and placed them in an advantageous point of view and by his own investigations added more real improvement to them in  England  than any of his predecessors  He invented and defined many terms expressive of ideas before unknown to the naturalists of  England  and introduced many others from writers of the best note As he wrote  Latin  in great purity and with great facility he gave his subjects all the embellishments that learning could bestow and his extensive erudition and knowledge of philosophy at large enabled him to add many collateral ornaments and useful observations with an aptitude and judgment that has been much applauded  The extent of his improvements in science procured him the admiration of his  contemporaries and have justly transmitted his name to posterity among those who have done honour to their age and country Even learned foreigners have been eloquent in his praise  French  writers have stiled him the "  English  TOURNEFORT" an eulogy that sufficiently evinced the high opinion they had of his merit And the late eminent HALLER not only attributes to RAY the merit of improving and elevating botanical knowledge but from his life dates a new aera in the records of the science  But Mr RAY's enquiries were not limited to natural knowledge His Foreign Travels and his Itineraries prove that antiquities polity government and legislation attracted a share of his regard as his philological books are evidences of his attention to language and of his desire to improve and illustrate his native tongue  To all these endowments he joined an unremitting industry and perseverance in the prosecution of his studies and what marks a fortitude of mind as uncommon as it is enviable his assiduity seemed to strengthen  with his age and to bid a defiance to the encroachments of infirmity and the prospect of dissolution I call to witness the magnitude of the attempt and successful issue of his exertions in writing the supplemental volume to his "History of Plants" and in beginning the "  Historia Insectorum  " at so late a period of his life  His singular modesty affability and communicative disposition secured to him the esteem of all who knew him and his eminent talents as a naturalist and a philosopher procured him many patrons and friends and preserved him from that obscurity which would otherwise probably have been his lot for notwithstanding his learning and probity as his principles did not accord with those of the times they were adverse to his fortune and he gained no emoluments in the church He had relinquished his fellowship at the commencement of the  Bartholomew  act not as some imagined from his having taken the  Solemn League and Covenant  for that he never did and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath but because he could not declare  agreeably to the terms of the act that the oath was not binding on those who had taken it Hence too his constant refusal of preferment afterwards occasioned him to be ranked by many among the nonconformists although he lived and died in the communion of the church of  England  He had seen with deep regret the disorders of the commonwealth and the usurpation and afterwards not less the threatening aspect of the reign of  James  II  His strong attachment to the principles of civil and religious liberty is manifested by his animated stile in the preface to his "  Synopsis  " where he expresses in glowing terms his joy and gratitude for having lived to see those blessings established by the Revolution  The character of Mr RAY cannot be contemplated by those who have a true relish for the studies of nature without a high sentiment of respect and gratitude nor by those who consider the exemplariness of his life as a man and his qualifications as a divine without veneration  There are two engraved portraits of Mr  RAY prefixed to his works both from a painting by  Faithorne  one by  W Elder  before his "SYLLOGE" in which seems to have been copied for the "METHODUS EMENDATA" in and the other by  Vertue  in prefixed to the "Physicotheological Discourses" In both these he is represented as Mr AMES describes it in  "an oval frame with hair whiskers band and canonical habit"  These engravings represent Mr RAY in the latter stage of his life  In dedicating plants to the worthies of botanical science the name of RAY challenged a dignified place and the liberalminded foreigner whose name has before occurred on these occasions forgot not so just a tribute PLUMIER called a new plant of the  dioecious  class which bears the habit of  bryony  and is nearly allied to the  yams  which he first discovered in the isle of  Domingo  by the name of JANRAJA in honour of our illustrious countryman LINNAEUS who had comparatively few opportunities of correcting PLUMIER established the  genus  but more aptly changed it to RAJANIA and enumerates three species He could not adopt the still more analogous term of RAIA since it had long been preoccupied in the animal kingdom and it had been justly constituted an axiom by the  Fundamenta Botanica  N  o  not to form in the vegetable kingdom any generical terms synonymous to such as were employed in zoology or mineralogy    CHAP  Poetical botanists  Cowley  Account of his poems on plantsNot deeply versed in the botany of his timeIntimate knowledge of natural history necessary to accomplish  "the poet of nature"  COWLEY  IN all times from VIRGIL and AEMILIUS MACER of the Augustan age from the spurious MACER and STRABUS the monk of  St Gall  in the twelfth century to modern times the beauties of flowers and the virtues of plants have been celebrated in verse  Marcus  NAEVIANUS first a physician and then a priest of  Flanders  sung the qualities of plants in his "  Poemation  " of and THUANUS the great historian amused himself with praising the  violet  and the  lily  in metre In our own country in  George  KNOWLES described plants of the  Materia Medica  in  Latin  verse and didactically applied them to their uses in medicine  But to proceed That  England  and  France  in the same age might not want their botanical laureats COWLEY in the one and RAPIN in the other arose to celebrate this theme  COWLEY after having found reasons for studying physic  "considering botany" as we are told by his late eminent biographer "as necessary to a physician retired into  Kent  to gather plants"  Here he wrote before the Restoration his "Two first Books on Plants" although they were not published till the year The remaining four were added in the edition of and the whole were republished with other poems in  o  pp  In the  first  book he celebrates the powers of various medicinal herbs more especially of those which gave ampler scope to his muse from antient renown of their virtue and were yet in frequent use and high esteem Such were betony wormwood water lily misseltoe and various others  In the  second  he invokes the goddesses  Luna Lucina Jana  and  Mena  and sings the praises of simples appropriated to the  diseases of the sex in which both antient superstition and modern belief supplied his muse with exuberant sources of gratification  In the  third Flora  calls forth all his powers in the narcissus the anemone the violet and the tulip with a variety of other ornaments of the parterre from the  coronary  tribe  In the  fourth  a more numerous set of the subordinate embellishments of the garden are recorded in various measure among which the attributes of the moly the lily poppy sunflower saffron and amaranth attract his muse with more than ordinary attention  In the  fifth  he celebrates in heroic measure the gifts of  Pomona  from the native products of  England  to the date of the east and the  tuna  of the west terminating his poem with near two hundred lines on  Columbus  on the  Spaniards  on the new continent and in expressing his hopes that to the devastations of conquest will soon succeed peace religion arts and science  In the  last  he displays the sylvan scene  from the oak of  Boscobel  to the lowly juniper and having constituted his druidical monarch the sovereign of the forest he makes him the oracle for a train of reflections on the usurpation the exile of  Charles  the Second his restoration and the  Dutch  war  His poems are accompanied by notes illustrating the etymology the names synonyms descriptions faculties and uses of the plants confirmed by authorities drawn from classical botanical and medical writers Of these he professes in his preface that PLINY among the antients and FERNELIUS among the moderns have been his chief resources Of botanical authors GERARD and PARKINSON are sparingly mentioned and they are the principal of that class  Great eminence in science is seldom attainable unless its foundation be laid in a devotedness of mind to its object in the early scene of life COWLEY did not enter on the study of physic till the middle age of man and then as is probable not with interested views towards practice Hence  it may fairly be presumed that he satisfied himself with moderate acquisition What was true of the whole may by fair analogy be applicable to a particular branch of it He had doubtless that portion of knowledge in the  materia medica  of plants which may be considered as adequate to the usual demand  But that COWLEY in his retirement should obtain an extensive and critical knowledge of botany as it stood as a science even in his day could not be expected His fervid genius could scarcely stoop to that patient investigation of nature by which alone it could be acquired Neither do the text nor the notes manifest sufficient proof of his intimate acquaintance with those authors of true same among the moderns through whose assistance the want of that information might in some measure have been supplied  Nevertheless as in the language of Dr JOHNSON  "Botany in the mind of COWLEY turned into poetry"  to those who are alike enamoured with the charms of both the poems of COWLEY must yield  delight since his fertile imagination has adorned his subject with all the beautiful allusions that antient poets and mythologists could supply and even the fancies of the modern  Signatores  of BAPTISTA PORTA CROLLIUS and their disciples who saw the virtues of plants in the physiognomy or agreement in colour or external forms with the parts of the human body assisted to embellish his verse Nor did he fail by these elegant productions to honour his subject his name and his country  I close these observations by remarking that poetry as it ever hath so it ever must derive from nature some of its most pleasing scenes of entertainment In the vegetable world the most expanded imagination of poetic genius will even without the aid of fiction so emphatically stiled the soul of poetry find a field sufficiently ample for the display of the brightest talents THOMSON witnesses this truth while in him we lament the want of that botanical knowledge without which the poet must ever be deprived of numberless sources of the  most beautiful imagery and such as would add peculiar grace and the most instructive power to his muse  And although the talent of the poet hath not often been united to that of the really scientific botanist there are not wanting instances of this union I might mention since the discovery of the sexes of plants the ode dedicated to CAMERARIUS and printed in his "  Epistola de Sexu Plantarum  " of which a translation by Dr MARTYN when a young man may be seen in BLAIR's "Botanick Essays" Professor  Van  ROYEN in published an elegant poem "  De Plantarum Amoribus et Connubiis  " And CUNO an ingenious merchant of  Amsterdam  in a volume of pages described in the plants of his own garden in verse for which he received the laurel from LINNAEUS by a new genus inscribed to his name  Whilst I am now writing I have the pleasure of congratulating all those whose love of poetry is aided by a taste for botanical science on a most elegant production in  our own country The beautiful display of the principles of the  Linnaean  system in the "Botanic Garden" under the delicate analogy of the "Loves of the Plants" in which the didactic design of the author is so happily embellished by  Ovidian  imagery as to have given that energy and ornament to the subject which has been hitherto wanting to all similar productions in the  English  language  CHAP  Merret  brief anecdotes ofHis  Pinax Rerum Naturalium  intended to supply the deficiencies of  How  's  Phytologia  Assisted by  Willisel Goodyer's  manuscripts  Merret  's other writingsHis papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  MERRET  "  CHRISTOPHER  the son of  Christopher  MERRET was born at  Winchcombe  in  Gloucestershire  Feb He became a student in  Gloucester  Hall in the beginning of the year two years after which time he translated himself to  Oriel  College and took the degree of BA in Afterwards retiring again to  Gloucester  Hall he applied to the study of physic and was created doctor in that faculty in About this time he settled in  London  and came into considerable practice was a fellow of the College of Physicians and of the Royal Society  He died at his house near the chapel in  Hatton Garden  in  Holborne  near  London  Aug and was buried twelve feet deep in the church of  St Andrew's Holborne  "  Thus far Mr  Wood  The publication which entitles Dr  Merret  to a place in these anecdotes is his "PINAX RERUM NATURALIUM BRITANNICARUM  continens  VEGETABILIA  Animalia et Fossilia in hac Insula reperta  "  o  pp  This is not noticed in the title as a second edition although there is one recorded by authors with the date of However I suspect it to be a mistake as no such edition is quoted by RAY He dates his book from the College of Physicians and is mentioned by MORISON under the title of "  Musei Herbiani Custos  "  Dr MERRET informs us that he undertook this work at the request of a bookseller to supply the deficiencies of How's "  Phytologia  " after that work was out of print and that it was intended to have been done jointly with Dr DALE whose death soon after the design was formed  threw the whole into his own hands He says he had purchased figures which JOHNSON had caused to be engraved with which the work was to have been embellished Why they did not appear no cause is assigned nor do I find any further notices of them Dr MERRET though unquestionably a man of learning taste and considerable information in natural history seems to have engaged in it too late in life to admit of his making that proficiency which the design required Add to this that being fixed in  London  and closely engaged in the practice of his profession he was rendered incapable of investigating plants in the distant parts of the kingdom He however engaged  Thomas  WILLISEL to travel for him and he tells us that WILLISEL was employed by him for five successive summers His son  Christopher  MERRET also made excursions for the same purpose and Mr  Yauldon  GOODYER furnished him with the manuscripts of his grandfather By these assistances Dr MERRET procured a large number of  English  plants and a knowledge of the  Loci Natales  Nevertheless he was not possessed of that critical and intimate acquaintance with the subject which might have enabled him to distinguish with sufficient accuracy the species from varieties He ranges the plants alphabetically according to the  Latin  names and has given few synonyms except those of GERARD and PARKINSON to which after the example of the writers of the "  Hortus Oxoniensis  " he has very commendably annexed the page He gives the general places of growth and specifies the particular spots where the rare plants are found  At the end of the Catalogue is subjoined a rude disposition of vegetables into classes somewhat like that of  John  BAUHINE This he hoped to have improved against the time of a second edition which probably Mr RAY's publications superseded Then follows a brief  Synopsis Etymologica  and a useful list of the plants as they flower in each month pointing out the duration of the time Dr MERRET has in this  Pinax  introduced many plants as new which on subsequent examination proved to be  only varieties a number of exotics evidently the accidental offspring of gardens and many that could never be met with by succeeding botanists in the places specified by him He enumerates upwards of species of  English  plants whilst the accurate Mr RAY only three years afterwards confines the number to Nevertheless several  British  plants make their first appearance in this  Pinax  and Dr MERRET would probably have secured his title to some others if he had not totally omitted to give descriptions of those which he introduces as new  The zoological part of this  Pinax  is exextremely superficial consisting merely of the  Latin  and  English  name with a reference to ALDROVANDUS GESNER JOHNSTON and MOUFFETT The mineralogy is not less brief and imperfect  Before the publication of this work Dr MERRET had printed "A Collection of Acts of Parliament Charters Trials at Law and Judges Opinions concerning those Grants to the College of Physicians"  o  This became the basis  as Mr  Wood  says of Dr GOODALL's book printed in  In he wrote "A short View of the Frauds and Abuses committed by Apothecaries in relation to Patients and Physicians"  o  This treatise engaged him in a controversy with the famous  Henry  STUBBE It may be presumed that all discussions of this kind howsoever well meant can have but little effect in reforming the abuses hinted at while the customary and legal constitution and polity of physic remain in the present state in  Great Britain  In he translated into  English  "The Art of Glass how to colour Glass Enamels Lakes c"  o  written by  Ant  NERI accompanied with an account of the Glass Dross And in the same work was published in  Latin  with Dr MERRET's "Observations and Notes" equal in extent to the work itself  Amst    o    Mr  Wood  informs us that he also printed in one sheet  o  "The Character of a compleat Physician or Naturalist"  Dr MERRET was among the earliest  members of the Royal Society after its incorporation and contributed several papers which were printed in the "  Philosophical Transactions  "  He made experiments on vegetation in the year by which he found that square sections of the bark from ash and maple whether separated on three sides only or wholly would firmly unite if tightly secured by plaister and packthread  Experiments on the loss of weight which a plant of the  Aloe Americana  with eleven leaves suffered by hanging up in the kitchen for five years In the first year it lost near two ounces and an half the second upwards of three ounces decreasing afterwards nearly in the same

work the  Historia Plantarum Oxoniensis  Outlines of his method  Jacob Bobart  the continuator of  Morison's History  Brief anecdotes of  MORISON  ROBERT  MORISON was born at  Aberdeen  in was educated in the same university and in took the degree of doctor in philosophy equivalent to that of MA He first applied to mathematics and was designed by his parents for the theological line but his taste for botany and physic superseded their intentions His attachment to the royal cause led him into the army and he received a dangerous wound in the head in the battle at  Brigg  near  Aberdeen  Upon his recovery he went to  Paris  the asylum of his countrymen Here he was first employed as a tutor to the son of a counsellor  Bizet  and in the mean time assiduously applied to the study of anatomy botany and zoology In he took the doctor's degree in physic at  Angers  He became so much distinguished by his skill in botany that at the recommendation of M ROBINS the king's botanist he was taken into the patronage of the Duke of  Orleans  uncle to  Lewis  XIV and appointed intendant of his fine garden at  Blois  with a handsome salary This establishment took place in and he held it until the death of the Duke in Here we are told MORISON laid open to the Duke his method of botany and was liberally encouraged by him to prosecute it The Duke also sent him into various provinces of  France  to search for new plants He travelled into  Burgundy  the  Lyonnois  and  Languedoc  and into  Britanny  the coasts and isles of which he carefully investigated and by these journies enriched the garden with many rare and some new plants  It was in this situation that he became known to  Charles  II who in on the death of his uncle the Duke invited MORISON into  England  and although solicited by the treasurer  Fouquet  on the most honourable and ample conditions to remain in  France  the love of his country overcame all temptations and he returned to  England Charles  II gave him the title of king's physician and royal professor of botany with an appointment of l a year and a house as superintendant of the royal gardens He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and acquired much fame for his knowledge of botany In this situation he remained till the year when having made an acquaintance with Mr  Obadiah  WALKER of University College with the Dean of Christ Church and other leading men of the university he was by their interest elected botanic professor at Oxford Dec and incorporated doctor of physic the day following He read his first lecture in the physic school in September and then removed to the physic garden where he  lectured three times a week to a considerable audience In this occupation and in conducting his great work the "  Historia Plantarum Oxoniensis  " he laboured to the time of his death which was thought to have been occasioned by a bruise received by the pole of a coach in crossing the street Nov He died at his house in  Greenstreet Leicester Fields  the next day and was buried in the church of  St Martin's in the Fields Westminster  SEGUIER seems to have placed improperly among MORISON's works the first edition of the "  Hortus Blesensis  " which he gives as published in the year when MORISON must have been only fifteen years of age This may have been a typographical error but the book in fact was the work of  Abel  BRUYNER physician to the Duke of  Orleans  and was not published till MORISON's first publication was a second edition of this catalogue under the following title "HORTUS REGIUS BLESENSIS  auctus accessit Index Plantarum in Horto contentarum nemini Scriptarum et  Observationes generaliores seu Praeludiorum pars prior  " Lond  o    The "HORTUS BLESENSIS" raised the author's character and contributed as the writer of his life observes to recommend him to the station he afterwards held at  Oxford  It contains the rudiments of his method of classification He professes to give a list of new plants but many of them proved to be only varieties and others such as were well known before There were nevertheless some new and rare plants of exotic as well as indigenous origin the latter such as he had himself first discovered in  France  In this work is also given his "HALLUCINATIONES  in  CASPARI BAUHINI  Pinacem tam in digerendis quam denominandis Plantis et his Animadversiones in tres Tomos Historiae Plantarum  JOHANNIS BAUHINI" a work which  Haller  calls "  Invidiosum Opus  " and which while it proves both the accuracy and diligence of the author must be confessed to be unbecomingly severe on these two illustrious writers who  as they did not profess to write a system are here too rigidly tried by rules not invented when they wrote and of consequence the validity of which they could not have acknowledged  In a dialogue at the end of the "  Hortus Blesensis  " MORISON teaches that the genera of plants should be established on characters drawn from the fruit and not on any sensible qualities or supposed medicinal virtue He also learnedly defends the doctrine that all vegetables arise from seed a proposition not universally allowed the doctrine of equivocal or spontaneous generation having at that time many advocates among the learned  Dr MORISON during his residence in  France  in his occasional journies to  Paris  about the year became familiar in the family of Lord HATTON then resident at  St Germains  and whose second son  Charles  was much attached to natural history and became a voluntary and zealous disciple of our author Sixteen years afterwards Mr  Charles  HATTON sent over at the author's request a treatise with the plates already engraved  written by  Paul  BOCCONE on plants discovered by him in the southern parts of  Europe  principally in  Sicily  of which some were rare and some new BOCCONE was originally of  Savona  in the  Genoese  district and was born in He became a  Cistertian  monk of  Palermo  and was a man of singular and various erudition in natural history He visited  Corsica  and  Malta  travelled into  England Holland  and  Germany  and was for some time botanist to the Duke of  Tuscany  He was the author of several very curious works and died in He wrote on fossils but his botanical writings have greater originality and were of high value MORISON after having caused the seven last plates to be reengraved published the work alluded to above under the following title  "ICONES  et  DESCRIPTIONES RARIORUM PLANTARUM  Melitae Galliae et Italiae Auctore Paulo  BOCCONE  panormitano siculo serenissimi magni Etruriae Ducis olim Botanico  " Oxon  o  pp t fig  MORISON prefixed to this work a dedication  to Mr HATTON in which he defends not only the doctrine in general that all plants spring from seed but particularly against DIOSCORIDES and some of the restorers of science among whom were CAESALPINUS that all the ferns are furnished with flowers and seed  The plants described and figured in this book are most of them such as had not been noticed by foregoing authors A few of these are common to  Britain  The figures are small and neither well delineated nor well engraven but the work had its use as containing some plants of Southern  Europe  not to be met with in any other author and on this account derives some value to those who are curious in pursuing the history of plants in the sexual system as being quoted by LINNAEUS  As a specimen of his great work meditated under the name of "  Historia Plantarum Universalis Oxoniensis  " MORISON next published "PLANTARUM UMBELLIFERARUM DISTRIBUTIO NOVA  per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis ex libro Naturae observata et detecta  " Oxon fol  pp t The umbelliferous tribe is here divided into nine orders the genera of which are distinguished by the figure of the seed assisted in some of the subdivisions by the form of the leaf They are illustrated by figures of different seeds  The author has subjoined what he names  "Umbelliferous Plants improperly so called"  Such are  Valeriana Thalictrum Filipendula Valeriana graeca Pimpinella Sanguisorba  all which are very different both in character and habit except the  Valerian  from the natural class of which he treats  This specimen excited the attention of the learned augmented MORISON's patronage both abroad and at home and encouraged him to prosecute with vigour his great work of which the first volume came out under the following title "PLANTARUM HISTORIAE UNIVERSALIS OXONIENSIS  Pars secunda seu Herbarum Distributio nova per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis ex libro Naturae observata et detecta  " Fol pp The first part of the History on Trees and Shrubs was never printed Some have doubted whether it  was ever written but SCHELHAMMER  In additamentis ad CONRINGIUM  tells us that he saw the whole work perfect in the hands of the author MORISON himself assigns as a reason for publishing the Herbaceous Division first the greater magnitude of the undertaking arising from the vast number and consequent difficulty of finding proper distinctions and characters and because he was unwilling to leave the most difficult and abstruse part of his work behind him unfinished as happened to DELECHAMP and  John  BAUHINE Unhappily however MORISON's untimely death subjected his work to the same lot and did not allow him to finish more than nine out of the fifteen classes of his own system  He divides all herbaceous plants into fifteen classes under the following titles    Scandentes    Leguminosae    Siliquosae    Tricapsulares Hexapetalae    Tricapsulares aliae    Corymbiferae    Papposae Lactescentes    Culmiferae    Umbelliferae    Tricoccae Purgatrices    Galeatae et Verticillatae    Multisiliquae et Multicapsulares    Bacciferae    Capillares    Anomalae  From an inspection of this table it appears that his method is not uniformly founded on the fruit in fact much less so than that of CAESALPINUS but on the fruit and the habit conjointly since the  Corymbiferae Umbelliferae  and  Galeatae  with the  Verticillatae  arise from the disposition of the flower the  Scandentes Culmiferae  and  Capillares  from the habit the seventh class from the qualities partly and partly from the seed Hence we see that only half the classes are founded on the fruit the fifteenth being truly an heteroclite assemblage His method would have approached much nearer to perfection on his own principles had he enlarged the number of his classes since in several instances they embrace natural orders much too distinct to be ranged together The orders or subdivisions of the classes are in some instances grounded on differences in the  seedvessel in others on the root habit and frequently on less scientific discriminations In the conduct of the work itself MORISON makes a separate chapter for each genus He begins by referring to the antients under each plant frequently subjoining the etymology The generical characters if indeed they can be so called are very vague and though taken from the parts of fructification are too often assisted by distinctions from the root leaves and mode of growth After the generical note follows a synoptical table of the species referring to the plates The descriptions are sometimes borrowed from  John  BAUHINE and others To most of the plants he affixes new specific characters and subjoins the  synonyma  of several authors He introduces at the end of the chapters the animadversions on the BAUHINES and an account of the virtues and uses of the plants  The five first classes only were published by the author who left the four succeeding ones finished These with the remaining classes were finished and published after an interval of nineteen years by  Jacob  BOBART  MORISON had the advantage of powerful patronage He was liberally encouraged by the university and enabled to embellish his work with a numerous set of tables on which are engraven about plants The figures are chiefly copied from other authors The new figures occur principally in the latter part of this work and are therefore to be attributed to the care of BOBART The six tables of  Mosses Fuci Corallines  and  Corals  at the end are except the few wooden cuts of GERARD the first of the kind graved in  England  and have great merit as the productions of that time All those of COLUMNA and CORNUTUS are copied in this work Those engraved by  Burghers  excel the rest and the figures of the grasses and mosses are incomparably beyond any other that are to be met with on the same scale the habit being admirably well expressed The republication of these tables with references to LINNAEUS's writings would even at this period be a benefit to the science  The third part or more properly the second volume of the "Oxford History of  Plants" was published by  Jacob  BOBART in fol pp A life of MORISON is prefixed to this volume and an engraving of him done by  White  with Dr PITCAIRN's Tetrastic underneath In the preface which is signed  Jacob  BOBART the reader is presented with a general view of the writers on botany from THEOPHRASTUS to the time of MORISON enumerating throughout the several nations of  Europe  in a chronological order the most learned authors on the subject The writer then informs us of the patronage and encouragement which MORISON received from the university to undertake this work and after lamenting the untimely death of the author and expressing his grateful sense of the honour he received in being appointed to continue the undertaking he lays before the reader the assistances he received in the prosecution of it An interval of near twenty years had given BOBART an opportunity of inserting a great number of plants unknown to MORISON from the works of RAY HERMAN PLUKENET the "  Hortus Malabaricus  " and other works  With respect to  English  botany great communications had been made by SLOANE PETIVER DOODY SHERARD and others By these means this volume contains nearly double the number of the former but the latter part of it proves too evidently that it did not receive the finishing hand of the original author since it appears in a very abridged form compared with what MORISON  The name of MORISON is perpetuated by PLUMIER in the application of it to a West Indian tree of the  monadelphous  class hitherto described only by himself and JACQUIN  himself had done  BOBART  Jacob  BOBART the continuator of MORISON's History was the son of  Jacob  the first superintendant of the Garden upon its foundation in Both the father and son filled their station with great credit to themselves and no less emolument to the Garden The elder is said to have been the author of the first edition of the "  Hortus Oxoniensis  " and his name is joined in the second edition as an associate in the work with Dr STEPHENS and Mr  BROWNE Mr GRANGER relates a humorous circumstance in his manners that  "on rejoycing days he used to have his beard tagged with silver"  He died in at the age of eightyone and left besides  Jacob  another son named  Tillemant  who was also employed in the Physic Garden  I cannot ascertain the time of BOBART's death but from the story related of him by Dr  Grey  in his edition of "Hudibras  Part I Canto ii l  " he must have been living in He had transformed a dead rat into the feigned figure of a dragon which imposed upon the learned so far that  "several fine copies of verses were wrote on so rare a subject"  BOBART afterwards owned the cheat but it was preserved for some years as a masterpiece of art There is a print of the elder BOBART with a distich dated by  Burghers  which confirms his German origin but it is very scarce  The name of BOBARTIA was given by LINNAEUS to a plant of the  graminaceous  tribe which he first discovered in HERMAN's collection of the plants of  Zeylon    CHAP  A short history of the rise and progress of  system method  or  classification  of plants from its origin to its revival in  England  General state of arrangements before  GESNER  and  CAESALPINERAY  and  MORISON  both laboured in the revival of  method  at the same timeAdvantages of  system  Various methods of  classification  enumerated  METHOD  AGREEABLY to my purpose I now proceed to give a concise account of the rise and progress of what is understood by  method system  or  classification  of plants arising from agreement in the parts of fructification independent of any association from the  sacies externa  or habit of the plant To this I shall add as brief an history of another important discovery that of the  sexes of plants  in consequence of which system itself has been carried to a much higher degree of perfection  There are no traces of what the moderns  call  system  in the writings of the antients by whom are preeminently signified THEOPHRASTUS DIOSCORIDES and PLINY Their knowledge of vegetables was confined to a few that were used in medicine and in the arts and conveniences of life and in treating on them their subjects are placed in great and inordinate divisions without the smallest approach to what is now meant by  classisication  THEOPHRASTUS treats his subject in general philosophically In his book "  De Causis Plantarum  " he considers the propagation culture qualities and uses of Plants in general but describes very few In his "  Historia Plantarum  " in which are described or enumerated about species he begins with the organization the generation and propagation of Vegetables He then treats largely in his  third  and  fourth  books on Trees In the  fifth  on Timber and the choice of the best In the  sixth  on Shrubs thorny Plants Roses and other ornaments of gardens In the  seventh  on oleraceous Plants and wild Plants In the  eighth  copiously on Grain of all kinds  And in the  last  on Gums Exudations and the methods of obtaining them  The object of DIOSCORIDES being solely the  Materia Medica  he discusses each subject specifically and in a separate chapter dividing the whole into five books in which as far as any order takes place they arrange into aromatic alimentary and medicinal plants His descriptions are taken chiefly from colour size mode of growing comparison of the leaves and roots with other plants well known and therefore left undescribed In general they are short and frequently insufficient to determine the species Hence arose the endless and irreconcileable contentions among the commentators In this manner he has described near plants to which he subjoins the virtues and uses To DIOSCORIDES all posterity have appealed as decisive on the subject  PLINY who treats of plants from the twelfth to the twentyseventh book inclusive of his "History" has drawn his resources principally from Grecian authors He is the historian of antient botany and recites the names of several hundreds not  mentioned by foregoing writers but many of these are unknown There is no scientific order in the disposition of his subject and the great value of PLINY's work consists in having preserved to us the remains of antient knowledge on the subject and in particular the application of it to the arts of life in those remote times  After the revival of learning in the fifteenth century the first cultivators of botany studied plants more in the writings of these fathers than in the book of nature and were solely anxious about extricating the plants of the  Materia Medica  scarcely adverting to those striking discriminations in the general port mein or habit the mode of growing and other obvious relations which mark the great natural families in the vegetable kingdom but were content to arrange them some according to the alphabetical nomenclature others from the structure of the root the time of flowering the places of growth the supposed qualities and uses in medicine or from other as unstable distinctions With them as with the antients there were nearly as many  genera  as  species  and if they gave the same common appellation to two or more plants they were led to it by some rude external resemblance such as size form of the root agreement in the colour of the flower and in the description of the species were frequently satisfied with comparing it to another plant well known to themselves and therefore left undescribed in their writings  This mode of arrangement though in a somewhat improved state is exemplified above in the order observed by DODONAEUS and is seen in our old  English  herbalists GERARD and PARKINSON  LOBEL in his  Adversaria  seems to have been the first who attempted to distribute plants into large families or classes from the general consent of habit or external form and mode of growing This he has done in an imperfect synoptical way and several of his families contain natural orders or classes nearly entire but frequently interrupted by great anomalies His arrangement was not sufficiently attended to at the time it was then excellent and was gradually improved until we see it in  its last and best form as exhibited by  Caspar  BAUHINE in his  Pinax  and especially by  John  BAUHINE in his  Historia Plantarum Universalis    As natural characters arose from similarity in the general port or habit of the plant and from an obvious agreement in the disposition of the stalk leaves stems and from that of the flower fruit and seed so they at length forced themselves to observation Thus the general habit of all  grasses  the plants with a  papilionaceous  flower such as pease and vetches the  siliquose  plants such as mustard cresses turneps c the  verticillated  as mint baum hyssop germander c the  umbellated  tribe parsley carrots hemlock angelica the  conebearing trees  and several other tribes were too striking not to be seen even by a superficial observer But as these constitute only a part of the whole so no characters were formed for those plants which the eye could not immediately refer to some of these classes Still less had any generical agreement arising from uniformity in the fructification been detected Had all the species of plants arranged themselves under  natural classes a natural method would easily have followed but the intermediate links notwithstanding the efforts of the most skilful are yet unknown Hence arose the necessity of artificial systems which are now become but too numerous Some have imagined that the more pure any artificial system preserves the natural classes the greater is its excellence but experience does not confirm this idea Those arrangements are found to lead more immediately to the plant sought for the classes and subdivisions of which are simple and drawn each uniformly from the same parts of the fructification  Conrad  GESNER the LINNAEUS of the age in which he lived is universally agreed to have been the first who suggested this true principle of classical distinction and generical character as is manifest from various passages in the  Epistles  of that great man  Epist Medicinal à  Wolphio  ed p et passim  He instances the agreement of the  Staphisagria  with the  Consolida  the  Scorzonera  with the  Tragopogon  the  Molucca  with the  Lamium  the  Dulcamara  with  the  Solanum  the  Calceolus  with the  Orchides  and he expressly says that the character should be formed from the flower and the seed rather than from the leaves This was in the year Other passages occur by which it appears he had the same ideas so early as But perhaps there is no proof of the importance he gave to these parts more indubitable than his having been the first who delineated them separately with the figures of his plants of which numerous instances may be seen in the tables published by SCHMIEDEL  But GESNER did not live to improve the hints he thus drew from nature and what is wonderful they were neglected by those great luminaries of the science CLUSIUS and the BAUHINES It was reserved for CAESALPINUS a man in whom was united an exquisite knowledge of plants with a truly philosophical genius He had been the disciple of GHINUS and was afterwards physician to Pope  Clement  VIII He described with exquisite skill the plants of his own country and left an  Herbarium  of  species He extended GESNER's idea and commenced the period of systematic arrangement In his "  Libri xvi de Plantis  " published he has arranged upwards of plants into  classes  founded after the general division of the trees from herbs on characters drawn from the fruit particularly from the number of the capsules and cells the number shape and disposition of the seeds and from the situation of the  corculum radicle  or eye of the seed which he raised to great estimation The  orders  or subdivisions are formed on still more various relations  Fabius  COLUMNA improved this doctrine of  classification  in by extending it to the formation of  genera  which CAESALPINUS had not effected all his species being separately described COLUMNA indeed did not exhibit a system but he shewed the way to complete it by the union of species under one common name from similarity in the flower and fruit and he invented several of the terms now in use to denominate those parts This noble invention  nevertheless lay dormant for near a century and the glory of reviving and improving it was reserved for  Britain  RAY and MORISON both laboured in it at the same time and with them must commence the aera of systematic botany in  England  It was an object thought worth contending for and each of these writers had their partizans who respectively bestowed the laurel as they were led by their various motives or attachments I shall not enter into the merits of their claims further than to observe that both seem to have turned their attention to the subject nearly about the same time and that Mr RAY had certainly priority in point of publication if it may be allowed that the tables which he drew up for Bishop WILKINS's "Real or Universal Character" which was published in contain the outlines of a system And certainly these rudiments though hastily done as Mr RAY confesses sufficiently prove that he had bestowed no small attention on the subject That foreign writers have more commonly attributed to MORISON the revival of method  may have arisen from their being less acquainted with Bishop WILKINS's work which was extant only in the  English  tongue Mr RAY informs us in the second edition of his  Catalogus Plantarum Angliae  that Dr WILKINS meditated a translation of his "Universal Character" into  Latin  with figures for the use of foreigners and Mr RAY himself performed it but the death of this good prelate in prevented the completion of the design He adds that his Method in a more elaborate state had been delivered into the Bishop's hands for the abovementioned work  Dr MORISON exhibited the outlines of his scheme in the "  Hortus Blesensis  " the year after the publication of the Bishop's book and exemplified it in his "History of Plants" in Mr RAY did not detail his till the year in the "  Methodus  " in which he freely acknowledges the assistance he received from CAESALPINUS COLUMNA JUNGIUS and even from MORISON's work On the contrary Dr MORISON assumes to himself the merit of having drawn all his resources in the fabrication  of his system wholly from nature and his own observations preserving every where the utmost silence respecting any assistance derived from former writers Assumptions which could with difficulty be acceded to and which drew upon him the censures of TOURNEFORT and other masters of the science who were well acquainted with the fountains of knowledge that were then open to him and the assistances he must have drawn from GESNER CAESALPINUS and others  At this distance of time and under the present enlightened state of science the systems of RAY and of MORISON must not be scrupulously examined CAESALPINUS laid a foundationstone on which if our  British  architects raised a  Gothic  structure their successors have improved it to a style of greater symmetry and elegance  The introduction of  system  was fortunate for science as it brought with it by degrees the establishment of generical characters on a like assemblage of essential parts in several species As new plants  were daily discovered in the old continent and were pouring in from the new the nomenclature of botany was in danger of being again overwhelmed with that chaos in which  Caspar  BAUHINE found it when he reduced it into some order by his laborious and incomparable  Pinax  System  enabled botanists to refer new species to  genera  already formed and restrained that licence before taken of giving a new generical appellation to each new plant for although in the multitude of methods which followed this discovery plants of the same genus in one system were frequently referable to a different genus in another yet with this inconvenience annexed they were more readily investigated than under the vague distinctions of the older writers  The restoration of  system  was in the words of LINNAEUS the beginning of the golden age of botany and the revival of it having taken place in  England  presently raised up several learned men among us who gave new life and vigour to the whole science The names of SLOANE PLUKENET  SHERARD and PETIVER will ever remain illustrious in the annals of botanic knowledge  It also turned the attention of the learned on the continent to the subject Rival systems were soon constructed some on the  fruit  as the basis of the classes in conformity to the systems of CAESALPINUS RAY and MORISON and others on the  flower  Thus  Christopher  KNAUT in and HERMAN in fixed on the  fruit  whose systems were improved by BOERHAAVE in  RIVINUS in chose the  flower  alone considering the  number  and  regularity  of the  petals  as the base of his classical characters and was followed by RUPPIUS in and LUDWIG in TOURNEFORT who elaborated his  method  beyond his predecessors in chose the  figure  of the  corolla  as the principle of  classification  and MAGNOL in took the  calyx  alone  If it should be enquired on this occasion in what the  methods  of CAESALPINUS RAY and MORISON differ from the arrangements  used before their time by DODONAEUS LOBEL and  John  BAUHINE since those also are established on the habit and in which many of the natural classes are tolerably well preserved it may be answered in a summary way that habit even in BAUHINE's order the most perfect of them is the prevailing principle without regard to agreement in the parts of fructification except in those classes where nature has joined both together this is a difference much more essential than may at first be apprehended and what is still less accurate than a regard to habit alone some of their classes if they are worthy of that appellation no definitions of them being prefixed take their name merely from the mode of growing as  Scandentes  from the structure of the leaf  Nervifoliae Rotundifoliae Crassifoliae  place of growth  Aquaticae  and what is still less eligible the aspect and supposed agreement in the qualities such are  Malignae Mollientes Papavera  under all of which are promiscuously collected plants as dissimilar as possible in the structure of the flower and fruit  CHAP  History of the discovery of the  sexes  of plantsThe doctrine of the antients on this headTheir knowledge very limitedThe universality of this processThe discovery of  Millington  and  Grew  Subsequent writers who have confirmed or opposed the doctrinePresent idea of it exhibited  SEX OF PLANTS  TO the revival and establishment of  method  succeeded a discovery of the highest importance to botanical science I mean what is with great justice called analogically The doctrine of the  sexes  of plants or the knowledge that throughout the vegetable kingdom the influence of the dust of the  antherae  upon the  stigma  was necessary in order to produce fertile seed By the establishment of this fact not only the physiology of vegetables was greatly advanced but in the end practical botany equally improved since on this foundation has been built that system of the great  Swede  which is now so universally followed Of the rise and progress of this investigation I proceed to give a concise account before I pursue the sketch of  British  authors  A vague and indecisive opinion concerning the  sexes  of plants prevailed among the antient philosophers of  Greece  We are informed by ARISTOTLE that EMPEDOCLES particularly taught  "that the sexes were united in plants"  This opinion was a natural consequence of the doctrine which this philosopher in common with ANAXAGORAS DEMOCRITUS and PLATO taught  "that plants were sentient and animated beings"  This idea has met with ingenious advocates among the moderns who have been induced to favour it not only from the general analogy existing between animals and vegetables and the difficulty of fixing the limits between them but from the more striking instances of apparent irritability and obedience to the action of certain  stimuli  such are the general affection plants have for light the rotatory motion of many towards the sun the faculty of others in closing the leaves  at night called not unaptly the  sleep of plants  and the opening and shutting of many flowers at stated times with equal propriety denominated  vigiliae florum  the rising of the flower of aquatic plants out of the water every morning during the state of florescence as instanced in the  Nymphaea  and still more signally in the  Vallisneria  To these may be added the more remarkable examples in the  Mimosa  and  Oxalis sensitiva  in the  Dionaea muscipula  the  Drosera  and the  Hedysarum gyrans  and finally in the exquisite irritability of the  stamina  and  antherae  in various species EMPEDOCLES nevertherless though he maintained the doctrine of the  sexes  does not attempt to confirm it by any facts or reasonings deduced from the knowledge of the uses of the separate parts in flowers but from analogical deduction founded merely on his general doctrine  ARISTOTLE or rather the author of the  Books on Plants  which bear his name combats the opinions of EMPEDOCLES and his followers respecting the sentient and animated principle in vegetables yet it is evident  he had himself no decisive ideas or specific knowledge drawn from nature relating to the  sex  of plants He placed it in some instances in the different habit alone or in other discriminations foreign to the consideration of the flower and though he shews an inaccurate knowledge of the particular circumstances of the palm and the figtree yet he denies in another place that either of them produce flowers  This imperfect idea of the  sex  of flowers in the  Date  and even in the  Figtree  is of high antiquity being recorded by HERODOTUS THEOPHRASTUS and PLINY The necessity which the antient cultivators of the  Datetree  were under of promoting the action of the maleflowers on the female which operation held also in some measure in the  Figtree  the  Pistachia  and the  Mastic  would almost necessarily suggest the application of this analogy with the animal kingdom Nevertheless although the fact was thus obtruded on their senses inattentive to the structure of flowers and ignorant of the offices of the several parts they remained unacquainted with the true operations  of nature in this phaenomenon though daily present to their observation  The antient fathers of botany and particularly DIOSCORIDES it is true applied the distinction of male and female to many other plants but it was entirely without regard to true analogy or discrimination of functions in the flower It was frequently applied to such as carry all the parts of the flower within the same  calyx  or on the same stalk on account of stature greater degree of fertility or other marks unconnected with the fructification In the  diaecious  or such as have the  stamina  and  pistils  on separate plants of the same species the real male plant was in some cases denominated the female of which the  Mercurialis  may be mentioned as one instance among several others  Exclusive of a numerous set of plants in which the  stamina  and  pistils  are separately placed either on different parts of the same individual or on different plants of the same species constituting the  Monaecious  and  Dioecious  classes of LINNAEUS the  following  genera  from other tribes as recited below  Arundo  Anagallis  Aristolochia  Cistus  Filix  Mandragora  Paeonia  Polygonum  Tithymalus  Verbascum c c  To which have been added by others  Abrotanum  Abies  Amaranthus  Balsamina  Caltha  Cornus  Crista Galli  Ferula  Nicotiana  Orchis  Pulegium  Quercus  Symphytum  Tilia  Veronica c c  contain species to which DIOSCORIDES has applied the distinction of male and female from circumstances having no analogy with those of the  Datetree  This doctrine of the sexual analogy between plants and animals made but little progress with the  literati  in botany upon the revival of science since the first of those who mention it is CAESALPINUS This critical and learned author notices male and female plants in the  Oxycedrus  Taxus Mercurialis Urtica  and  Cannabis  of which he says the barren plants are males and the fertile females adding that the latter as is observed in the  Datetree  becomes more fruitful by being planted near the males from thence receiving a genial  effluvium  which excites a stronger fertility From this observation it may almost be inferred that he had instituted experiments on some of these kinds but we do not find that he carried the idea beyond the abovementioned species to vegetables in general  Adam  ZALUZIANSKY a  Polish  writer in is said by some to have distinguished the  sexes  of plants I have not seen his book but from what is found relating to his opinion in other writers I conjecture that his observations if not wholly taken from CAESALPINUS do not exhibit any original matter on this subject In fact no further progress was made for near an hundred years after this time and the honour of the discovery  "that this sexual process was universal in the vegetable kingdom and that the dust of the  antherae  was endowed with an impregnating power"  is due to  England  Whether the true idea of this process originated with Sir  Thomas  MILLINGTON to whom it has been ascribed may justly admit of a doubt since Sir  Thomas  has left no written testimony on the subject and Dr GREW's mention of him does not imply that he actually received the idea from him Add to this that Mr RAY in the summary view of all GREW's discoveries which he has prefixed to his "History of Plants" does not once mention Sir  Thomas  MILLINGTON's name Interested as we must suppose Mr RAY to have been in every discovery relating to vegetables and candid as he was in his general conduct to the learned it is not likely that he should have failed in this instance to render praise where it was so justly due When we further recollect that Dr GREW had been some years engaged in those microscopical experiments on the anatomy of plants which have rendered his name estimable with all posterity that whilst he was thus employed in studying so intimately  the organization of vegetables and had observed that in whatsoever parts the flower might be deficient the attire or  stamina  and  apices  is ever present it is not strange that the true idea of its use should have been suggested to him  Dr GREW laid his opinion before the Royal Society in a lecture on the anatomy of flowers read Nov in which he maintained  "That the primary and chief use of the dust of the  apices  is such as has respect to the plant itself and so appears to be very great and necessary because even those plants which have no flower or foliature are yet some way or other  attired  so that it seems to perform its service to the seed as the foliature to the fruit In discourse hereof with our learned  Savilian  professor Sir  Thomas  MILLINGTON he told me that he conceived that the  attire  doth serve as the male for the generation of the seed I immediately replied that I was of the same opinion gave him some reasons for it and answered some objections that might oppose them"  He then explains  himself farther and advances that this foecundating power was not effected by the actual admission of the  farina  into the seedvessel but by means  "of subtle and vivific effluvia"  Mr RAY admitted the opinion of Dr GREW but at first with all that caution which becomes a philosopher as appears in his "  Historia Plantarum  " vol i p  Nos ut verisimilem tantum admittimus  He assents to it with less reserve in his "  Synopsis Stirpium Britannicarum  " edit p and in the preface to his "  Sylloge Stirpium Europaearum  " published in we find him producing his reasons for the truth of it and yielding his full approbation to it  In  Rudolph Jacob  CAMERARIUS professor of botany and physic at  Tubingen  in his "  Epistola de Sexu Plantarum  " appears among the early advocates for this analogy and being convinced by the arguments of GREW and RAY seems to have been the first who gave stability to the whole by experiments These he made on  Maize  the  Mulberry  the  Ricinus  and the  Mercurialis  the three first of which he  deprived of the staminiferous flowers and the last he separated far from the female and found in all that the fruit did not ripen CAMERARIUS however very fairly produces also some objections against the doctrine founded on experiments which at this day have little weight since they were made on plants of the  Cryptogamous  or  Dioecious  classes in the last of which it is now known that sometimes a flower or two of a different sex may be found intermixed with others  In Mr  Samuel  MORLAND desirous as it should seem of extending the  Lewenhoekian  system of generation into the vegetable kingdom produced a paper before the  Royal Society  in which he advancesthat the  farina  is a  congeries  of seminal plants one of which must be conveyed through the style into every  ovum  or seed before it can become prolific Mr MORLAND's hypothesis tended to confirm the general doctrine by exciting curiosity on the subject at a time when  Lewenhoek  's theory was popular but was not admissible in itself since few styles are hollow or if  perceptibly tubular not pervious enough to admit particles of the usual magnitude of the  farina  After this time several of the learned on the continent entered into researches on this subject  M  GEOFFROY in in a paper read before the  Royal Academy of Sciences  after having formed a theory by conciliating GREW's and MORLAND's into one concludes by assertingthat the germ is never to be seen in the seed till the  farina  is shed and that if the plant is deprived of the  stamina  before this dust is fallen the seed will either not ripen or will not prove fertile  It is matter of surprize that the illustrious TOURNEFORT should wholly reject the doctrine of the  sexes  of plants So far even from acknowledging this function of the  farina  that he held it to be excrementitious See  Isagoge in Rem Herbariam  p  Julius  PONTEDERA a strenuous follower of TOURNEFORT a noble  Italian  of  Pisa  illustrious for his knowledge of the antient languages and antiquities of  Italy  and not less celebrated for botanical knowledge  and literature combats also the notion of this analogy and uses of the  stamina  through the whole second book of his "  Anthologia  " In the end he rejects the sexual analogy and considers it as entirely chimerical But finding all flowers furnished with a style or tube he advances that it serves to convey the air to the fruit by which an intestine and fertilizing motion is excited in the seed or ovary  In Mons VAILLANT published "  Sermo de Structura Florum horum Differentia usuque Partium  " which had been read the year before at the opening of the Royal Garden In this discourse he describes the bursting of the  antherae  in a style too florid for philosophical narration He relates several of his own discoveries on the nature of the  farina  and the exploding power of the  antherae  and concludes with assenting entirely to Dr GREW's sentiment though without naming him that impregnation is performed by means of a subtle  aura  and not by the transmission of the dust through the style alledging against it those  reasons I have mentioned in speaking of MORLAND's opinion  In  England  about the same time Dr  Patrick  BLAIR by his "Botanick Essays" contributed greatly to extend the knowledge and confirm the truth of this subject BRADLEY FAIRCHILD MILLER and others assisted in the same design and since that period I believe it has met with few opposers One of the most formidable was the late learned Dr  Alston  professor of botany at  Edinburgh  from whose laboured disquisition the adversaries to this opinion of the  sex  of flowers may furnish themselves with the most cogent arguments that an intimate knowledge of the subject hath enabled a very diligent and learned writer to produce  The more recent experiments made by the Abbe SPALANZANI with a direct view to impugn this doctrine do not appear to have been conducted with that degree of skill and accuracy which is sufficient to outweigh the numerous train that may be thrown into the opposite scale Even  some of the Abbe's own experiments seem rather to strengthen the opinion he means to overthrow  Having traced the history of this important process in the economy of vegetables to the time of LINNAEUS I judge it will be unnecessary to accompany the reader through a particular detail of authors below this period In LINNAEUS founded his system on this doctrine and the additional arguments and experiments produced by himself his pupils and followers have established the truth of it to the compleat satisfaction of impartial enquirers Those however who wish to peruse the most perfect summary of all the arguments and experiments in favour of this analogy are referred to the "  Sponsalia Plantarum  " written in the year and printed in the first volume of the "  Amoenitates Academicae  " and to the "Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants" written by LINNAEUS in which obtained the premium of the Academy of  Petersburgh  and has lately been translated into  English  by the ingenious and learned possessor of the  Linnaean  collection  To which may be added the writings of KOELRUTER in the succeeding year which have not a little tended to confirm the subject in question  It would be unjust to the memory of Dr GREW to conclude this history without remarking that the result of the latest and best experiments have confirmed his idea  "that the  farina  itself is not carried to the  rudiment  of the seed"  but that foecundation is effected by the effluvia This will appear by citing the summary view of the doctrine as exhibited by LINNAEUS himself in the Dissertation above mentioned  "While plants are in flower the  pollen  falls from the  antherae  and is dispersed abroad At the same time that the  pollen  is scattered the  stigma  is then in its highest vigour and for a portion of the day at least is moistened with a fine dew The  pollen  easily finds access to the  stigma  where it not only adheres by means of the dew of the part but the moisture occasions its bursting by which means its contents are discharged What issued  from it being mixed with the  fluid  of the  stigma  is conveyed to the  rudiments  of the  seed  "  I remark before I conclude that how just soever it may have been in a philosophical view to consider the  stamina  and  pistils  as answering to the respective functions of  sex  in the animal kingdom it should not have been forgotten that in animals this process is voluntary but that in vegetables notwithstanding all that the ingenuity of the antients and moderns have urged in defence of the sentient principle we are not  yet  justified in referring this process to any other than what we are accustomed to call a mechanical cause  The principle of this it will not be expected that I should explain It may be conjectured that after a perfect elaboration of the juices in the  antherae  and  stigmata  some species of attraction takes place between them perhaps of the electrical kind somewhat like this having been manifested in the flashings observable in some flowers in the evenings The reader will easily perceive that I refer to the appearance first  seen in the  Indian Cresses Tropaeolum majus  by  Elizabeth Christina  the daughter of LINNAEUS as related in the  Swedish Acts  in and since confirmed in the  Garden Marigold Calendela Officinalis  the  Orange  or  bulbiserous Lily Lilium bulbiferum  and the  African Marigold Tagetes patula et erecta  by the observations of  M  HAGGREN And as in the universe at large the phaenomena of electricity are sensibly manifested to us by particular modifications of the principle occasionally excited although unquestionably ever active so possibly the same principle may prevail through the whole vegetable creation in the process above mentioned though unobserved hitherto except in these instances Be this as it may that general decorum which is due to philosophical subjects ought to have restrained that reprehensible language used by  Vaillant  and some other writers on this subject and even by LINNAEUS himself which has justly disgusted many readers and prejudiced the instruction they meant to convey  CHAP  Willisel  Collects plants for  Merret Morison

WILLISEL  IT is not to the sons of erudition alone that botany is indebted for all its discoveries and improvements The love of plants has not unfrequently seized with uncommon ardour the minds of many on whom the light of learning had not shed its influence and spurred them on in the pursuit of this knowledge to attainments that have been highly beneficial to the science  From such let not the pride of learning withhold that praise which is so justly due One of the most remarkable instances of this kind is well known to those who are conversant with the writings of MERRET RAY and MORISON and I feel regret at not being able to commemorate the name of  Thomas  WILLISEL with some of the circumstances of his life since I am uninformed of the time and place both of his birth and of his death This industrious man seems to have devoted much of his life to the investigation of  English  plants and as he lived at a time when  British  botany was yet imperfect he added largely to the stock of new discoveries He was employed by Dr MORISON soon after his establishment at  Oxford  to collect rare  English  plants and Dr MERRET informs us as hath been noticed that he travelled five summers at his expence into the different parts of  England  to make collections for his "  Pinax  " which appears to have been greatly enriched with many of the most rare species by the labours of WILLISEL  I believe he was once sent into  Ireland  by Dr SHERARD Mr RAY was benefited by his researches and if I do not mistake he accompanied that celebrated naturalist in one of his tours The emolument arising from these employments was probably among the principal means of his subsistence  His knowledge was not confined to the vegetable kingdom since Mr RAY informs us that  "he was employed by the  Royal Society  in the search of natural rarities both animals plants and minerals for which purposes he was the fittest man in  England  both for his skill and industry"  In the letters of Mr RAY there occurs an observation made by WILLISEL of the various trees on which he had found the  Misseltoe  growing I enumerate them below  Oak  Ash  Lime  Hasel  Willow  White Beam

that of  Oxfordshire  and  Staffordshire  although not professedly a writer in the botanic line cannot be omitted in a work of this kind  He was born at  Borden  near  Sittingborne  in  Kent  and educated at  Wye  in the same county entered a student in  Magdalen Hall  in and in took the degree of doctor of laws He became fellow of the  Royal Society  and was made one of the secretaries in In the same year he was constituted the first keeper of the  Ashmolean  Museum and professor of chymistry all which places he kept till having also in been appointed  Mowbray  herald extraordinary and register to the earl marshal or court of honour then newly revived after having lain dormant from the year He died April There is a whole length portrait of  him the last of the right hand group in the  Oxsord  Almanack for the year  Dr PLOTT was a man of various erudition but is at this time best known for his natural histories of  Oxfordshire  and of  Staffordshire  The first of these was published in in folio and again in with the author's corrections and additions by his soninlaw Mr  Burman  vicar of  Newington  in  Kent  The natural history of  Staffordshire  in in folio and reprinted in In each of these volumes he records the rare plants of the county describes the dubious ones and such as he took sor nondescripts and figures several of them To these works the  English  botanist owes the first knowledge of some  English  plants and this circumstance justly entitles him to a place in this work  It is amusing to remark the price of literature a century ago The subscription for PLOTT's  Staffordshire  was a penny a sheet a penny a plate and six pence the map  He conducted the publication of the  Philosophical Transactions  during part of his secretaryship to the Society and wrote the following papers  A Paper on the Formation of Salt and Sand from Brine of the Pits in  Staffordshire  Printed in N  o    On Perpetual Lamps in imitation of the sepulchral

justice to add that with due allowance for the time when he wrote he has not  been excelled by any subsequent writer It were to be wished that more examples of the like kind might be adduced but there are few exactly of the same scope After Bishop GIBSON in his edition of CAMDEN printed in had inserted the provincial lists of plants drawn up by Mr RAY several writers of county histories have either from their own knowledge of the subject or by the aid of friends inserted catalogues of the  more rare  plants in their respective works As these form in an especial manner a part of  English  botany it is incumbent upon me to enumerate them  The first after CAMDEN is "The Natural History of  Lancashire Cheshire  and the Peak in  Derbyshire  " Oxford fol By  Charles  LEIGH MD The author takes into his catalogue the maritime plants with the others and briefly recites the virtues and the medicinal classes to which the subjects belong He subjoins his conjectures on the food of vegetables and contests the opinion of Dr WOODWARD  that plants are nourished by the earthy principle alone  "An Essay towards a Natural History of  Westmorland  and  Cumberland  wherein an account is given of their

been mentioned before as a correspondent of Mr RAY He here enumerates professedly the plants not mentioned in the  Synopsis  of that author amounting to about twenty of which however some were only varieties  "The Natural History of  Northamptonshire  with some account of the Antiquities" By  John  MORETON AM FRS rector of  Oxendon  in the same county Lond fol This is a work of merit In the list

rare plants are the Verticillate Knotgrass the Roman Nettle the Gunhilly Heath and the Cornish Pennywort of which last there is a very indifferent figure in tab f Under the article Sundew  Drosera  there is a curious and interesting observation made by Dr BORLACE in which he asserts that the wellknown pernicious quality of that vegetable in producing the rot among sheep where it abounds does not arise from any caustic power in the vegetable but from an insect which lays its eggs and feeds on the  plant From his account this insect appears to be the  Dropsy Worm  of Dr TYSON or the  Hydra

their discoveries in the indigenous botany of  Britain  alone I cannot therefore omit to mention so eminent a man as Sir  George  WHELER He was the son of Col WHELER of  Charing  in  Kent  and was born in at  Breda  his parents being there in exile with the royal family At the age of seventeen he became a commoner of  Lincoln College Oxford  and before he took any degree went on his travels He spent near two years in  France  and  Italy  and in travelled into  Greece  and  Asia Minor  from whence he returned in  November  He was knighted before he took his master of arts degree which was conferred upon him in in consideration of his learning and in return for a present of antiquities collected in his travels He afterwards took  some valuable preferments in the church was created doctor of divinity in and died Feb  In was published "A Journey into  Greece  by  George  WHELER Esq in company of Dr SPON of  Lyons  in six books with four tables of coins and many other sculptures" Fol pp  These gentlemen travelled with PAUSANIAS in their hands by whose means they corrected and explained several of the antiquities and traditions of  Greece  The primary objects of these learned travellers were to copy the inscriptions and describe the antiquities and coins of  Greece  and  Asia Minor  and particularly of  Athens  where they sojourned a month These travels are highly valued for their authenticity and are replete with sound and instructive erudition to the medallist and antiquary  Mr WHELER appears on all occasions to have been attentive to the natural history of  Greece  and particularly to the plants of which he enumerates several hundreds in this volume and giv  the engravings of some These catalogues sufficiently evince  his knowledge of the botany of his time He brought from the East several which had not been cultivated in  Britain  before Among these the  Hypericum olympicum  St John's Wort of Olympus is a wellknown plant introduced by this learned traveller RAY MORISON and PLUKENET all acknowledge their obligations for curious plants received from him  After Sir  George  WHELER entered into the church he published "An Account of the Churches

extant in those Parts with a seasonable Application" Lond  The Rev  Granville  WHELER of  Otterden Place Kent  and rector of  Leak  in  Nottinghamshire  who died in was the third son of Sir  George  WHELER and became his heir He distinguished himself as a gentleman of science and a polite scholar He was the friend and patron of Mr  Stephen  GRAY who jointly with him contributed to revive the study of electricity in  England  Let me be allowed to add that I wish to mention the name of this gentleman with gratitude from the recollection of that encouragement which I personally received from him in my pursuits of natural history at a very early period of life and which was of such a nature as seldom fails to animate the minds of the young to exertion and improvement  END OF THE FIRST
