ear the man of rhimes  Should always speak the language of the times  And little else hath been of late in hearing  Than terms and phrases of Electioneering  Our author therefore sends me to assure ye  Worthy and free electors of Old Drury  How happy he should prove if it content you  That he be one of those who represent you  The state  Poetic  laws and legislature  Like the  Political  in form and nature  Phoebus the Nine and Bards of reputation  King Peerage Commons of the scribbling nation  Now from Parnassus' throne the Prince of Wit  It seems hath issued out his royal writ  For a new memberNo offence to give  To a late worthy representative  Who ris'n to favour hath from us retreated  And 'mongst the Lords of t'other house is seated  His service lost presuming you may need him  The present candidate would fain succeed him  Not that he vainly boasts on this occasion  He met encouragement from your persuasion  Or that both friends who love and foes who hate him  Have been unanimous to nominate him  'Tis for this loyal borough his affection  And patriot zeal that make him risk th' election  To his constituents subject to controul  With whose good leave he means to stand the poll  Trusting secure to their impartial choice  The town uncanvass'd for a single voice  Nay brib'd no brother burgess bard of note  Nor by corruption gain'd one critick's vote  Too proud to beg too modest to demand  By merit only would he fall or stand  Nor enmity nor friendship interfering  He only asks a fair and candid hearing  If after that you should with scorn reject him  Or make one honest scruple to elect him  He'll lay his unadvised scheme aside  And frankly own himself  NOT QUALIFIED  Dramatis Personae  Lord  Courtly  Mr  J AICKIN  General  Melmoth  Mr  HOLLAND  Alderman

Mineral  IS there any thing in the papers Barrister  Furn  Nothing but medical nostrums and lists of idle company at these watering placesOne would think the whole kingdom was infected with the plague  Giving  Mineral  the newspaper  Min  With two at least credulity and dissipation  Furn  By both which doctor we thrive and have therefore no reason to complain  Min  I don't know thatmdashthey are useful indeed to you liberal adventurers who depend on tre doctrine of chances  Furn  Ay and to you medical adventurers too The practice of physick depends as much on the doctrine of chances as that of gaming Besides credulity breeds quacks as dissipation does gamesters and both may become too general for us regular practitioners  Min  They may sobut you seem Barrister to have thrown up the cards with regard to public parties at leastyou play a higher game I suppose in private eh  Furn  Why faith cards and dice are but paultry tools in the hands of a real artist The passions and foibles of mankind are not only more effectual but more entertaining implements  Min  True but you can play upon them at the cardtable I have seen you do it Barrister I have seen you do it  Furn  What when you were at the same game doctorAh You spiders of the faculty spin your thread as fine as any of the fraternity woe be to the poor flies that are entangled in your web  Min  Nay but we physicians do let our patients recover  Furn  Ay sometimes as we gamesters let novices win and for the same reason to hook them only deeper into play Do you ever cure any body of coming to Bath  Min  Why to be sure we have some regard to the prosperity of the corporation  Furn  And to your own doctorEvery crazy constitution that arrives becomes to you physicians a good annuity a copyhold inheritance of which you are tenants for life For your own sakes therefore you must keep the tottering tenements from tumbling But that's all if you patch them up to stand wind and weather from season to season it is as much as you require A thorough repair might bring on a writ of ejectment and undo you  Min  Nay Barrister you are now too severe do you think the faculty quite void of the milk of human kindness Have we no nature  Furn  The milk of human kindness ha ha ha Yes yes you make a fine milch cow of poor nature indeedBut come let us hear who are our new comers  Min  Ay let us see  Reads the newspaper  arrived since our last the duke and duchess of Danglecourt the earl and countess of Squanderfield count Splenetic baron Podagra lord and lady Dupe lord CourtlyO pray is not that he who had such an ill run the last meeting at Newmarket  Furn  The samesix thousand upon Gimcrack and four upon SilverLegsfaith the turf was a little cruel to him considering the state of his finances  Min  So I suppose he has now mortgaged his estate and is come to take his revenge of Newmarket races on the rooms at Bath  Furn  Entre nous doctor his estate was dipped before but let that go no farther I am under obligations to his lordship and have the honour of his confidenceHave we any more of the right honourables  Min  No but commoners like herrings at Shetland in shoals  Reads again  Sir Peregrine Peevish and lady Mr alderman Lombard Mr and Mrs Fretful the two Miss Drinkwaters Master and Miss Ricketty and so on with Mr and Mrs Master and Miss to the end of the catalogueDo you know any of these I have mentioned  Furn  Yes the alderman is consigned to me do you know him  Min  Oh very well I was called in when he was last at Bath and sound him laid up with the gout We set him upon his legs again with difficulty in a month But the boisterous wretch swore our sees were so exorbitant that he would hobble upon crutches through the ward of Cripplegate all his lifetime  sooner than be so fleeced again by any waterdoctors in Christendom  Furn  Ha ha ha well said Mr Alderman you must know he is a kind of witHe is come down now to stand candidate for a vacant borough here in the West to which he is gone over to shew himself to the constituentsHe is recommended to me by our old friend Scrutiny Canvass of Lincoln'sInn who tells me the curmudgeon rolls in wealth and though covetous as a miser in any laudable pursuit is lavish as a prodigal in the prosecution of any absurd project of his own at present it seems he is disposed to empty his coffers to get into parliament so that if money will effect it he is in a fair way of becoming a limb of the legislative body of GreatBritain  Min  And a lame one he is likely to prove however I wish you success with himEgad here he comes  Furn  As I expected He was to meet me here on his return to settle the business of the canvass  Min  WellI shall only just renew my acquaintance and take leave of you  Furn  Nay I believe you need not withdraw I shall affect no secrets for whenever a man wants to take the advantage of another his surest mode of deception is the appearance of openness and plaindealing  Mineral  walks to the back of the stage and puts the news paper in his pocket  Enter Alderman  Lombard  Furn  Mr Alderman your humble servant  Lomb  Oh counsellor your servantWell I havebut  seeing Mineral  you are not alone I see  Furn  Only a particular friend of mine and I find an old acquaintance of yours too Mr Alderman  Min  coming forward  Mr Lombard your most obsequiousI hope I have the satisfaction to see you well  Lomb  Oh your servant doctor your servant Tolerably well I thank you my supporters are pretty stout at present if you can reap any satisfaction from seeing thatI do from feeling it I assure you  Stamps sturdily on the ground  Min  And I from hearing it believe me Mr Alderman  Lomb  Indeed doctor I can't but no compliments I don't come to Bath this time to be made such a fool of as I was the last  Min  Aside  It will be well for you if you are not made a worse considering how much better hands you have fallen into  Lomb  Wou'd you think it Squire Furnival when I was here two years ago this worthy physician and his associates had the conscience to take above a hundred guineas of me only for coaxing the cramp out of my great toe  Min  A violent paroxysm of the gout  Lomb  You gave it that formidable name indeed to enhance the merit of your prescriptions but what did you administer but a dozen or two of innocent slip slops and as many gallons of insipid warm water  Furn  Nothing more  Min  Oh Sir Mr Lombard's was a bad case a very bad case indeed we had frequent consultations of the faculty upon it  Lomb  Yes yes my case was a bad one sure enough for while you and your accomplices had your hand in my purse and merited the discipline of the horsepond you hurried me without mercy to be duck'd and pump'd like a pickpocket  Min  You are pleased to be sarcastical Mr Lombard but when the sit returns I shall find you of a  different opinion So 'till then your most obsequious humble servant  Exit  Lomb  Oh good day to you Sir  Furn  I am sorry Mr Alderman you were so severe on my friend Mineral The doctor has more interest in the borough of Gluttonbury than you imagine  Lomb  Has he  Furn  He cures the mayor and aldermen of at least a dozen surfeits in a year They cannot possibly live without him  Lomb  Odso I am sorry for that and yet I am partly glad of it too as you say he is your friend you may easily excuse my raillerytell him it is my way that's an excuse for any thing you know or egad for the matter of that if I thought 'twou'd secure him in our interest I'd be taken with a slight touch of the gout tomorrow morning  Furn  Not just now Mr Alderman if you please Electioneering is bustling work and if we shou'd be hard run you may have a use for your feet you know  Lomb  Ha ha hawell I have been to Gluttonbury  Furn  I hope to good purpose Mr Alderman  Lomb  Egad I am afraid to very little You shall judge As I was quite a stranger in the place I naturally inquired you know for the mayor of the corporation who received me kindly enough for a stranger and civilly offered to call a meeting of the principal town'speople the next day Accordingly I got a speech ready for them at my inn over night and met his worship with Mr recorder and the rest in the townhall in the morning  Furn  Good  Lomb  Ay so far so good but you shall hear I assured them as usual on these occasions of my firm attachment to my king and country in general and of my regard for Gluttonbury in particular  Then I talked to them a good deal about the constitution and the revolution and the protestant succession and all thatgiving them now and then a little liberty and property trade and prosperity and so forth and egad upon the whole I thought I acquitted myself with energy  Furn  And what effect had it  Lomb  No effect at all Sir  Furn  No  Lomb  No  Furn  You surprize me  Lomb  No effect at all in the world Sir I assure you You may well be surprized indeed  Furn  And yet its not so very surprizing neither Oratory like every thing else has its day We have seen some of our greatest speakers talk themselves out of breath till they talked themselves out of credit For after all words are but wind you know Mr AldermanHad you no bankpape rabout you a written plea has sometimes a better effect than one delivered viva voce not all the rhetorical flourishes of Cicero and Demosthenes put together have half the pathos of the plain handwriting of three or four petty clerks in Threadneedlestreetbanknotes banknotes Mr Lombard are now adays the only prevailing arguments  Lomb  Egad Mr Furnival I begin to think we citizens don't rightly understand these mattersYou gentlemen of the law know how to go about them much better For my part I own it is a little out of my way All I can say therefore is that if you will undertake the canvass you shall want no materials that I can furnishBut pray what is my rival candidate He is a man of war I finddoes he carry any weight of metalHas he the summum bonum about him ha  Furn  It seems he has a good estate Sir besides his commissionHe bears a very great character in the neighbourhood They tell me he is a patriot a  man of public spirit one whose motto is Dulce e  decorum  Lomb  pro patria morum Ha Mr Furnival Ay I remember the passageI have construed it formerly at MerchantTaylor'stho' by the way I remember I thought it mighty silly even in those days Die for one's country ha ha haThat might be patriotism among the ancient Romans but we modern patriots live upon our country Mr Furnival Ha ha ha  Furn  Ha ha ha very well very well indeed Mr LombardBut as to men of your antagonist's profession they are bound in honour you know to die at the word of command without grumbling  Lomb  Right counsellor rightBut whathe has a regiment he is a colonel I think  Furn  A bloodyminded colonel I assure you Mr Lombard one who makes it his boast that he is ready to spill the last drop in his veins in defence of his constituents He'll bleed for 'em Mr Lombard  Lomb  Bleed for them Ha ha ha Yes yes he must bleed for them and that pretty freely too let me tell him if he intends to stand the poll with me But stay here's company coming suppose we adjourn to my lodgings and there settle our plan of business  Furn  Or to mine Sir which are nearer  Lomb  With all my heart  Exeunt  SCENE II Mrs Mildmay's lodgings  Enter  Narcissa  and  Sophia  Narc  So cousin Sophy your papa I find is arrived at Bath we shall now see what account you will give of yourself for having contracted a violent inclination for a man without his knowledge and that too for a man whom he never saw  Soph  I contract a violent inclination for a man Narcissa what I suppose because Colonel Camply has repeated his visits pretty frequently of late  Narc  Nay nay it is too late to retract now It is to no purpose to play the prude with me or the coquet with him any longer Have not you said an hundred times that you preferred colonel Camply to all the men in the world  Soph  I must have talked in my sleep then Narcissa for I am certain my tongue never so betrayed my heart while I was waking  Narc  Oho you confess then it wou'd have betrayed your heart if it had talked so Ah cousin Sophy  Soph  Pshaw that's provoking now  Narc  Ha ha ha a little slip of that same tongue my dear But make yourself easy for waking or sleeping I believe it is very innocent of betraying your regard for colonel Camply my information is founded on better authority I assure you Those speaking eyes of yours Sophy are apter telltalesWhat you reckon nothing it seems on the significant nods expressive smiles and languishing looks the colonel and you have been reciprocally exchanging these three months past  Soph  Go go you are a giddy girl Narcissa  Narc  And you a sober stay'd prudent unmarried gentlewoman just turn'd of twenty Prithee cast off this formality of countenance and leave it to the wear of mincing abigails and maiden aunts with their other weatherbeaten remnants of antiquity I tell you it does not at all become a girl hardly out of her teens and little older than myself Believe me those who affect to be grave when they are young will be glad to be merry when they are old excuse me my dear but I am a little in spirits this morning  Soph  Indeed you have always an astonishing flow of them  Narc  Have not IWell but come How is it to be The colonel will break the matter I suppose to your father the bargain will be struck the  match hustled up cloaths bought jewels presented and the day fix'd immediately I shall be all impatience till it be settled and we stand up to dance at your wedding I have not had a country dance no not this half century as lady Pedigree says  Soph  And yet this business which you seem to have dispatched so expeditiously may be longer in settling than you imagine if indeed it be ever settled at all  Narc  Hey day What's the matter now Your lover and you are I am sure so far agreed that you need only tell each other your minds if you have not done it already He has a fine fortune of his own and is satisfied with yours though not a penny be added to your grandfather's legacy And then your papa who loves you so tenderly as to see you once a year and write to you by some of his clerks once a quarter will hardly plead paternal fondness to keep you longer on his hands  Soph  I don't know how it will be There is like to be a strange revolution in my father's affairs I learn he is going to be married himself  Narc  Himself well but I hope he'll be so good as to see you married first  Soph  At the same time I suppose my dear to save charges for I hear he has partly made up a match for me with some noble lord  Sighs  Narc  And do you sigh for that Sophy Now for my part were I in your case I should think it mighty clever that is on a supposition the lord were deserving of the lady For as you have no violent inclination you know for colonel Camply it is an easy matter to break through a slight one for a private gentleman in favour of a peerO gad that I had but an independent fortune of thirty thousand pounds as you have and that two or three of these lords wou'd pay their court to me  Soph  Why what wou'd you do Wou'd you have one of them  Narc  Yes if I lik'd them well enough Otherwise I should be apt to shew myself a daughter of Eve and repeat the first sin of disobedience if any father of mine should take upon him to know what I lik'd better than I did myself But why do I talk Poor I that am dependent and can expect barely half that sum  Soph  Have yet a viscount for one admirer and a commoner for another worth e'er a lord of them all  Narc  I don't say thatI have not the vanity to compare Mr Melmoth my Sir Frederic that may be to the flower of the British nobility tho' I own I would not exchange him for the best of the bunch of baronetsBut yonder comes the colonel in his usual sorrowful saunter with his hands in his bosom and such a penitential countenance What in the name of wonder can be the matter with him now Had you a quarrel with him last night Did he win of you at cards tear the mount of your fan tread upon the train of your new sack or make a loud whisper of a secret that has been publicly talked of among your acquaintance for these four months  Soph  Prithee what can that be Narcissa  Narc  Oh the old story man's constancy and woman's caprice the subject of half the love songs and halfpenny ballads that has been chanted since Cupid was an arch wag and his mother an errant jilt Upon my word Sophy you sometimes treat that poor gentleman very ill and if you don't behave more consistently I will as surely tell him as it is true that your cruelty is all affected that you are as much in love with him as he is with you and in short that you doat on him to absurdity Therefore look to it Sophy look to it  Exit  Soph  Go thy ways my chearful chatty agreeable cousin  Enter Colonel  Camply  Soph  Good morrow colonel  Camp  My dearest Sophia good morrow  Soph  You look grave Mr Camply  Aside  But I guess the reason and will for once divert myself with it  Camp  It is impossible I should not be concerned at every accident that throws an obstacle in the way between me and my Sophia  Soph  Oh Sir obstacles are to be surmounted the more difficulty the more honour  Camp  Yes Madam and the more danger too  Soph  O fie colonel a soldier and apprehensive of danger  Camp  Of whatever I may be apprehensive Madam I fear none but that of losing you  Soph  And is there any danger of that Methinks I should be glad of an accident of that kind that I might see how gallantly you wou'd behave on the occasion For to say the truth I have been so sparing of giving you trouble colonel that if I should yield so I am afraid you would hardly set any store by what cost you so very very little pains in the acquisition  Cam  How can you take a delight Sophia in giving pain to a heart so intirely devoted to your pleasure  Soph  Poor heart well come tell us its grievance What is the matter with it What are these dreadful obstacles you talk of Are they of my raising  Cam  No my dearest Sophia I have so much confidence in your generosity that I believe I should not  uneasy at any difficulties of your  Soph  is  olerably presuming however  and confident enough in all conscience  Yet whatever you may think Sir those obstacles wou'd be the hardest for you to remove I assure you and you may depend on it 'twill be your own fault if any difficulties thrown in the way by others prove either formidable or dangerous  Camp  Kind generous Sophia a thousand times let me thank thee for that assurance  Seizes her hand and eagerly kisses it  Oh how this declaration revives me  Soph  Well then colonel as you are now come to yourself again tell me plainly what's the matter You have been already with my father I suppose  Camp  No Madam but I purpose to do myself that honour tomorrow tho' it is probable from what I have heard today it will be to no manner of purpose  Soph  What you have heard I suppose that he intends to marry me to a title  Camp  I have Sophia and this piece of intelligence is attended with that of another unlucky circumstance Mr Lombard is come down to canvass in the borough for which I have declared myself a candidate  Soph  Call you that an unlucky circumstance If you have a mind to take any advantage of it it may on the contrary prove a lucky one for if I know any thing of my father he will certainly give up to you all his authority over his daughter Sophy if you will give up to him all your interest in the borough of GluttonburyAnd indeed now I think on't you are rather too young colonel for a senator Besides I should not chuse to have a husband taken up with the business of the nation when he should be employed in mine  Camp  Sophia  Soph  It seems as if you intended to be no longer my humble servant when you are so ready to enter into the service of your constituents  Camp  By heavens Madam if you require it  Soph  You'd give up your country for your mistress I supposeI thank you SirNo no colonel I did but jest with you I am not so unreasonable as that comes to neither Here's my hand I have made my election do you go and do your best to make sure of yours or stay I was just going to take my chocolate Will you drink a dish before you go  Camp  With pleasure MadamMy dearest Sophia  Exeunt  Enter Mrs  Mildmay  and  Narcissa  Narc  Bless me mama what harm can there be in the indulgence of a little harmless mirth Is it possible my chearfulness can give any body offence  Mrs Mild  I am fearful my dear lest it should offend nobody so much as yourself When I was of your age I was just such another wild unthinking thing as you are Careless of censure and presumptuous that while I preserved my innocence I might laugh at decorum as mere formality but the world is come to such a pass Narcissa that virtue itself is often of less consequence to the peace and happiness of our lives than the appearance of it It is not enough to be innocent unless we seem so  Narc  And in what do I appear so heinously guilty madam In laughing at the rueful dejection of the poor colonel or in giving encouragement to the addresses of Mr Melmoth to whom you have never before made any objection  Mrs Mild  It is true my dear I have hitherto made none because I wou'd not assume too great an influence over you in making a choice of so much  importance to the future happiness of your life But I shou'd but ill discharge the duty of a mother Narcissa if I did not confess and that without any particular objection to Mr Melmoth that I think you would be much happier with my lord Courtly who hath made the fairest offers and of whose regard for you I am now more than ever convinced  Narc  I am obliged to lord Courtly Madam for his good opinion of me and under other circumstances he might possibly have had less reason to complain of my indifference  Mrs Mild  Well my dear I only speak my sentiments I have no objection to your engaging the affections or encouraging the addresses of any deserving lover but I must insist on your indulging yourself less in raillery at the expence of your friends  Narc  But I shou'd think Madam one's friends would be the least apt to take offence and that the behaviour you complain of might be a good method to put their friendship to the proof  Mrs Mild  Then you think wrong Narcissa I know by woful experience the danger of trifling with a heart that loves one It was this fatal indiscretion in me that gave rise to a groundless jealousy in the breast of the fondest of husbands and deprived you of the tender affections of a father  Narc  I am happy Madam in having that loss so well supplied by yours that I never felt it but my dear mama why do you so often touch of late on this subject You know it always makes you melancholy If my father were living indeed but that is surely impossible  Mrs Mild  And yet I know not of a certainty that he is dead tho' I own 'tis most probable as I learned he embarked for India near twelve years ago and as I before have told you I have not once heard of him since  Narc  What pity Madam you did not retain his name for now if even living and anxious for reconciliation his patience might be exhausted in fruitless inquiries after you  Mrs Mild  Under the forgotten name of Wildman True Narcissa but your rigid uncle to whose kindness we are nevertheless indebted for our whole fortune so highly resented your father's injurious usage of me that he insisted on my renouncing the name and if possible even the memory of a man who had so cruelly wronged me  Narc  And yet I have heard you say my father was not altogether to blame  Mrs Mild  No my dear Narcissa It is the recollection of the share I had in contributing to that fatal separation that distresses me It is that which makes me look upon your union with Frederic Melmoth under the most fearful apprehensions lest a similar disposition to mine shou'd make you fall into the same errorsGood heav'n what wou'd have become of us if my relations satisfied of the innocence of my conduct had not forgiven its absurdity and continued their protection to me after the departure of Mr Wildmanunhappy Wildman fond frantic manAnd yet favoured as I have been ever by them how have I since lived in the eye of the worldin a state of solitary neglected doubtful widowhoodI had once a son too and you a brother but whether he be living or lost to us for ever with his father heav'n only knows  Narc  Nay my dear mama you now carry your surmises too far You certainly do us wrong to indulge your melancholy as I my chearfulness  Mrs Mild  I cannot help it Narcissa In you my hopes are now all centered Let me not be deprived of the only comfort left me in the prospect of your happiness  Narc  Be assured mama that if it depend on me you shall not I will check the vivacity of my temper and be more on the reserve  Mrs Mild  Do my dear and in return be assured that I shall be no farther an advocate for lord Courtly than his merit will justify But you must excuse my still indulging a wish that you had less partiality for young Melmoth  Narc  Indeed madam he is possessed of so much goodness of heart that I shou'd hope it out of his power to make a bad husband  Mrs Mild  I hope so too but the goodness of a man's heart Narcissa is not always a sufficient guard against the impetuosity of his passions witness your unhappy father  Narc  Pray mama no more I beg of you Let us join the colonel and my cousin Sophy  Mrs Mild  I have done my dear lead the way  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I Young  Melmoth's  lodgings  Enter  Lombard  followed by a servant in livery  Lombard    as he enters    NOT know whether your master be at home  Serv Mr  Syllogism his gentleman is at home Sir  Lomb  His gentleman ehWhat the supercilious coxcomb with the starch phyz that called at my lodgings this morning I supposeAn affected formal rascalI had a good mind to have broken his head for the flippancy of his tongue and the impertinent gravity of his countenancewell send him to me then  Serv  Here Mr Syllogism comes Sir  Exit  Enter  Syllogism  Lomb  Is your master within fellow  Syllog  Sir my godfathers gave me a name and you see I wear my own livery  Lamb  But you have a master notwithstanding such a one as he is  Syllog  True Sir such as he is talis qualis herus non magister nec preceptor He learned more of me than of his tutor and is too grateful to treat me as a menial  Lomb  Zounds Sir was not you at my lodgings an hour ago with a draught from Frederic MelmothDon't you serve him  Syllog  Faithfully and all his secrets keep  Lomb  Is it a secret then if he be within  Syllog  None Sir unless he were within and then there might be a doubt whether he was within or no But when he is actually gone out Sir there's no mistery in the case it is clear as daylight that he is not at home  Lomb  What pedantic puppy are you Some catchpenny casuist that our young spendthrist picked up among the starving bookworms at college I suppose  Syllog  I was indeed a servitor at BrazenNose when Mr Melmoth was matriculated  Lomb  And was expelled for a pimp when he was rusticated for a rake ha  Syllog  I can't deny Sir that I took more to him than either of us did to our books and being thought too disorderly to enter into orders I determined to abandon short commons and the classicks to follow the fortunes of my young master That Sir is my history  Lomb  And so you may now deservedly starve together Tell your master that from me  Syllog  I hope Sir you are not goingIt is so very civil a message that I should take it as a particular favour if you might be prevailed on to stay a minute or two and tell him yourselfI expect him in every moment to dress so that if your worship pleases to step into the next room and just sit down a little  Lomb  I think I will as I have something to say to him  Aside  that may prevent his troubling me with any more of his draughts  Exit  Syllog  Now if any thing should have touched the heart of this old Turk and sent him hither with the money for the bill he refused to accept just now But Oh here comes my master  Enter Young  Melmoth  Y Melm  Well Syllogism have you presented the draught with my compliments to alderman Lombard as I ordered you  Syllog  Yes Sir and he accepted the compliments civilly enough but the draught itself he has churlishly protested  Y Melm  Protested how  Syllog  Why Sir he protested he would not pay it and though there was no notary by I am afraid he will be as good as his word  Y Melm  Impertinent This covetous old fellow can't bear the thoughts of my spending my father's money though he gets so much per cent for its remittance Did you tell him I was under an immediate necessity for it  Syllog  I did Sir and for that reason he said if he had no other he would not accept it  Y Melm  What can the penurious old scoundrel mean  Syllog  So I thought to myself Sir exactly What cap this penurious old scoundrel mean thought I But to save us both the trouble of guessing Sir suppose we ask him he is but in the next room waiting your honour's return  Y Melm  Why did you not tell me that before Go and let him know I am here  Exit  Syllogism    What can have brought the churl hither good manners or ill nature It must be the latter for of the former he has not a single grain  Reenter  Lombard  and  Syllogism  Lomb  Well young gentleman  Y Melm  I think not quite so well old gentleman You refused it seems to pay the bill I drew upon you this morning  Lomb  I did so and shall refuse to pay any other you may draw in the afternoon  Y Melm  Come come Mr Alderman you may think you are acting the part of my father's friend in these indirect endeavours to restrain what you are pleased to call my extravagance But if I know any thing of his disposition from the tenour of his correspondence with me he'll not think himself obliged to you for reducing me to the necessity of applying elsewhere for the supplies requisite to support the character of a gentleman  Lomb  Your father's friend No Sir I act as my own friend as you ought to do and as every wise man will doThe character of a gentleman I should be glad to know how many cent perannum your modesty thinks necessary to the support of this fine character It is not a month since you drew for the last five hundred and now you are pressed for another By the exigence of the present demand indeed this shou'd seem destined to stop some gaming gap to pay some debt of honour that right or wrong must be instantly discharged to support the character of a gentleman  Y Melm  It is in part Sir therefore without any more words let me have the money or a bill upon your house in London may do as well  Lomb  May it Sir But for the future you will please to discharge your debts of honour with your own bills of creditTo be plain with you young man I am very sorry your father did not take my advice in having you bred up to some creditable employmentHad you condescended to have been one of my clerks you might by constantly fingering of money for seven years together have learned the value of itOr had you been bound apprentice to  Y Melm  Sir  Lomb  I say Sir had you been brought up to any profession but that idle and unprofitable one of a  gentleman as you call it you might have had a proper resource when any sinister accident had befallen you  Y Melm  What accident then hath befallen me  Lamb  Oh none but what is very naturalSir John Melmoth your father is dead  Y Melm  My father dead I am sorry for it  Lomb  You have reason for he hath with great justice cut you off with a shilling  Y Melm  You astonish meBut it cannot be I'll not believe it  Syllog  Aside  Nor Ifor it does not seem to be orthodox  Lomb  You may Sir I have seen the copy of his will which hath been duly authenticated and by which he hath bequeathed his whole fortune to the lady his second wife to whom he was married some time before his decease  Y Melm  Married again Bequeathed his whole fortune to his wife and forgot his son  Lomb  Forgot him No no Did not I tell you he had remembered him in a very moderate bequest which is expressly justified by the mention of his profligate character  Y Melm  Profligate So then I am reduced to beggary by your malicious misrepresentations of my conduct What a wicked vile incendiary  Lomb  Nay nay young man don't be abusive and call names Don't put yourself in a passionTo convince you I am more your friend than you are disposed to think me I will recommend you to the favour of lady Melmoth your motherinlaw who is returned to England and has put the management of her affairs into my hands Nay with her ladyship's good leave I may probably soon stand in a nearer relation to you myself than you are aware of in which case I shall take proper care of you on your good behaviourin the mean time as you are  short of cash there there's a note for a hundred But no more five hundreds to pay gaming debts and support the character of a gentlemanMark that  Y Melm  Taking the note and throwing it contemptuously on the ground  And there Sir take your paultry paper again I scorn to be obliged to a man who has acted by me so base so villainous a part No Sir if what you have told me be true I must bear my misfortune as I may Yet even then I hope to find friends that will set me above being indebted to my greatest enemy  Walks about in great agitation  Lomb  Nay if you are so proud and prodigal as that comes toto throw bankbills under foot I have done with you  Stoops to pick up the note in the mean time  Syllogism  who stood behind snatches it up and makes him a low bow  Syllog  Excuse me Sir your worship seems to misunderstand us here a little My master by no means intended you should take the trouble to stoop so low he would not affront you so much Sir The truth of the matter is he never carries such trifling bits of paper as these in his pockets for fear of flirting them out with his handkerchief The conservation of these Sir is my duty as his pursebearer Depend on it I'll take proper care of it Testudo intra tegumen tuta est  Putting up the note in his pocketbook  Lomb  Well well as it is the last you are likely to receive and I can place it to account I leave you to make your best of it  Exit  Syllog  Young Melmoth still walking about in great agitation  Ha gone and left the note behind Let us see if it be no imposture no sham upon us No Good as the Bank itselfNow do I shrewdly suspect that all this old fellow has been telling us is apocryphal if not a downright lie Would this tenpercent  Mammon else so readily trust a disinherited spendthrist with an hundred pounds on the mere verbal security of his valetdechambreThis story is certainly trumped up to carry on some scheme of Sir John's to restrain the extravagance of his son He has a mind I suppose to make the youngster bite on the bridle a bitEgad a laudable design and it cannot be for my interest or his to spoil the project  Aside  Y Melm  Throwing himself into a chair  Dead my father dead  Syllog  Aside  He takes it sadly to heart But as there is certainly nothing in the story I'll venture to humour it without taking part in his afflictions  To young Melmoth  Dead Sir and cut your honour off with a shilling  Y Melm  Starting up and walking about  It is impossible  Syllog  Impossible To be sure Sir it is impossible for a man to die Such a thing never happens the graverails in the churchyard and the tombs in the abby are all lyars Haud disputandum est Indeed fathers do sometimes cut off their sons with a shilling Mine did so by me  Y Melm  Prithee hold thy peace I am shocked at your insensibility But if my ruin cannot affect you sure your own might which is involved in it  Syllog  Believe me Sir I am very sorry that yours should be so unhappily connected but it would be impertinent in me to repine at being found in such good company  Y Melm  Cease your ribaldry I am in no disposition to bear with it  Syllog  I wish with all my heart you were Sir you would be in a better temper But I beg your pardon I only meant to divert your melancholy  Y Melm  What an unfeeling mortal  A knocking without  See who knocks there  Syllog  Is your honour pleased to be at home Sir  Y Melm  To colonel Camply only  Exit Syllegism  What an unaccountable being is this fellow grateful and sincere in his attachment to others yet as insensible of their sufferings as destitute of all regard to himself so much is he taken up with the ludicrous display of the peculiarity of his disposition If we were not too unfeeling ever to be happy I shou'd envy his indifference  Enter colonel  Camply  Camp  My dear Frederic how do you do this morning  Y Melm  Faith melancholly enough and with reason  Camp  Then I am not the first messenger of illnewsyou have heard of your father's death I suppose But come though it be an afflicting circumstance you parted from him too early in life to feel much for his personal loss  Y Melm  I own it and had his fortune died with him I shou'd have supported the loss of that too with equanimity but to receive such a cruel instance of his want of paternal regard as that of bequeathing the whole of it away from me  Camp  I heard nothing of this By a letter I received from general Melmoth a relation of your father's just now arrived from India I learn that Sir John is dead but nothing more  Y Melm  Sir I have learned much more It seems the late Sir John Melmoth no long before his death was married to a second wife to whom he left his whole fortune  Camp  Are you well assured of this  Y Melm  Too well assured of it A father heavens and earth  Camp  Nay but compose yourself Things may not be so bad as you apprehendI expect the general himself hourly in Bath who I dare say when he comes to know your real character will if things are thus circumstanced be your friend At worst if you have a mind for the army I will engage on my own interest to set you presently at the head of a company Then Narcissa will have a handsome fortune and I cannot suppose after matters have been carried so far between you that this accident will prove any obstacle to your marriage  Y Melm  It is there there my dear colonel I feel this reverse of fortune the most severely For though Narcissa should be too generous to reject me merely from mercenary motives ought I to have less generosity than she ought I to take the advantage of her partiality for me to make a prey of her fortune and permit her to throw herself away on a young fellow without a penny in his pocket or a profession by which he might have the prospect of getting one No colonel till I am master of a competency at least equal to hers I will relinquish my pretensionsBut when that may be or what may happen in the interval O colonel  Camp  Prithee Frederic  T Melm  What a cruel disappointment is this When Narcissa had just consented to reward my passion and I expected my father in England to ratify our fond engagements  Camp  Nay but no more of this Why should you distress yourself at the doubtful consequences of perhaps an imaginary evil I cannot help thinking you are under some mistake but be it as it will I will venture to answer for it Narcissa is still yours Keep only this piece of information a secret from her 'till it be farther confirmed When I see you again we may be able to judge of it and proceed with more certainty  Exit  Young  Melmoth  solus  Keep it a secret from NarcissaNo I will fly and disclose it to her immediately she may else hear of it from some other quarter and I would not be thought guilty of deceiving her in the slightest instance She shall know the worst of my misfortune without delayWho waits there  Enter  Syllogism  Here Syllogism get ready to dress I am going out  Syllog  I don't think I can equip your honour decently with mourning 'till tomorrow Sir  Y Melm  No matter let me have the clothes I wore yesterday I am only going to acquaint Narcissa of my ill fortune  Syllog  Under correction Sir would it not be as well if she heard of it from somebody else Or if she never was to hear of it at all I should think it might be better still Narcissa is undoubtedly a worthy young lady but I would not have you place too great a confidence on the generosity of the sex If you have lost your fortune abroad Sir it is probable you will not find your mistress at home  Y Melm  Then shall I know the utmost rigour of my fate and that at once  Syllog  But to what purpose SirThings may not possibly be so desperate as you conceive or if they are why make them worse by bringing one misfortune so close on the heels of another  Y Melm  Inhuman father Attend me I say in the dressingroom  Exeunt  SCENE II Colonel  Camply's  Lodgings  Enter General  Melmoth  and Colonel  Camply  G Melm  I am glad my dear colonel to find you thus happily situated and also to hear that Mr Melmoth has merit enough to engage you so warmly in his favour A young fellow capable of making such valuable friendships can never be so bad as he has been represented I own we had but very sorry accounts of my wild kinsman transmitted us to India  Camp  My friend Frederic Sir is young and volatile but having sense and principle is in the way of reformation for he has not only good qualites enough to make himself friends among the men but to engage the esteem of a young lady of the first distinction for personal merit  G Melm  I am pleased to hear it An amiable and virtuous monitor of the other sex is certainly the best reformer of ours  Camp  And I am no less pleased for the sake of both to find his father hath not left him destitute as he hath been informed  G Melm  And yet if lady Melmoth his new motherinlaw had not set out for England before Sir John's decease that would probably have been the case her ladyship having taken advantage of the boy's irregularities to get her husband to make his will intirely in her favour Being no stranger however to her art and avarice I prevailed on him to make a subsequent testament just before his death by which the lady is more moderately provided for and the bulk of his fortune more equitably left to his son I am myself executor to this last will and shall take a proper opportunity to undeceive the young man as well as his father's agent on whom I find  the widow hath greatly imposed by means of the former will  Camp  This will be most agreeable news to my young friendI am impatient to communicate it  G Melm  With your leave colonel I had rather that were deferred I could not hope indeed to find a youth of his education and fortune as grave and prudential as a rigid moralist yet having received such an indifferent impression of his character I could wish to put his disposition a little to the proof His present mistake affords a favourable opportunity I wou'd therefore have him kept a while in the dark as to his real circumstances  Camp  Will not that be cruel generalConsider the young gentleman's anxiety  G Melm  I do but he will be so much the happier for it when he comes to be undeceived Besides I have my reasons and you may depend on it if he has real merit the required delay will turn out to his advantage It may be the means also of trying the disposition of his mistress whom I should wish to have a disinterested regard for him If she loves him in spite of his supposed poverty her constancy may be rewarded with a better fortune  Camp  Nay Sir I shall be ruled by you since you seem so much concerned for his welfare  G Melm  I am indeed greatly concerned for it colonel for though I am but a distant relation to him he is perhaps the nearest now living to me Besides I am bound to it in gratitude to his father to whose friendship I was much indebted for my own success in life Nay I am not only obliged to Sir John Melmoth for my fortune but even for his name which I long ago assumed on my departure from Europe  Camp  Assumed his name was yours not always Melmoth  G Melm  No Camply Many years before you knew me it was Wildman which on the supposition of having kill'd my antagonist in a duel I chang'd and wish'd might be forgotten  Camp  You raise my curiosity general  G Melm  Another time I may be more explicit for oh my Campley I have a painful secret labouring here that needs a friendly ear and heart like thine to ease me of its burthenGood heav'n or have or have I not a wife or daughter  Aside  Camp  I am sorry to see you thus affected general but I hope at nothing very essential to your happiness Yet whatever it be you know you may command my confidence and service  G Melm  I know it colonel but I now must leave you Some letters that arrived at Bath before me require immediate attention those dispatch'd I'll call on you again Nay no ceremony  Exeunt  SCENE III Mrs  Mildmay's  lodgings  Enter  Narcissa  and  Sophia  preparing to go out  Narc  A message from your papa Sophy  Soph  Yes my dear he is returned from his borough it seems and must speak with me  Narc  What does he want you to canvass for him or to produce you to your lordly husband that is to be Pray do you know who he is  Soph  What think you of lord Sweepstakes  Narc  A gamester  Soph  A Gamester child What imputation is that among people of fashion  Narc  Nay but if what I have heard of his lordship be true he'd give up his pretensions to any of our sex for the queen of trumps at any time  Soph  Then we shall never make a match that's certain but in obedience to my papa you know it is my duty to hear what he has to say for himself  Narc  Oh commend me to your obedience a most dutiful daughter I profess witness your attachment to colonel Camply my dear  Soph  I wou'd not be so firmly attached to colonel Camply as you are to Frederic Melmoth for all the world  Narc  Yes you would Sophy for one half of it nay for either of the four quarters Europe Asia Africa or America The world is a great thing child and contains a number of pretty little things in it  Soph  The best of which I wou'd venture to lay if I had it that you have some appointment this morning with your lover  Narc  I make appointments with men my dear oh fie but I shall stumble upon him by accident ten to one else at your aunt Pedigree's To tell you the truth I want my spark to do something to get himself into the good graces of my mama He does not stand so fair in her books as I cou'd wish and his rival lord Courtly has a powerful advocate of her  Enter Servant  Ser  Ladies the chairs are at the door  Narc  Ay come Sophy we only lose time here Let us about our business  Exeunt  Enter  Susan  with papers in her hand  Sus  So there they go to pay their morning visits and have left me to set things to rights after  themWhat a litter do these girls make with their loveletters and their billetdoux I protest if it were not for the pleasure that some people take in knowing other people's business I would not stoop to pick up their blottingpapers off the floor but Mrs Sift my lady's woman would lead me an uncomfortable life of it if I did not furnish constant information for her inquisitive temperWhat a pity 'tis I can't read writing myselfI might then perhaps take as much pleasure in these things as she does But she has the advantages of education and was brought up at a boardingschool To be sure the daughter of a Quaker clergywoman as she is Ods my life here's somebody coming  Crumpling up the papers and cramming them into her pocket  Enter Mrs  Mildmay  indisposed supported by

seized with such a fit of trembling that I had much ado to support her homeBut she recovers  Mrs Mild  Speaking wildly and laying hold of  Sift  's hand  And do I live to see thee once again To hold

Furnival'  s Lodgings  Enter  Furnival  and  Lombard  Furnival  THIS message from lord Courtly comes very opportunely Mr Lombard and the expedient it has suggested is a most admirable one  Lomb  Why as you say if his lordship has the electors of Gluttonbury under his thumb and is looking out for a wife I don't know that we could both do better than to make up a match between him and my daughter Sophy For as I am also going to marry again a daughter by a first wife will be a kind of incumbrance on the family you know I had partly agreed indeed with lord Sweepstakes to take her off my hands for sixty thousand poundsThe girl has thirty of her own left her by her grandFather  Furn  Lord Sweepstakes  Lomb  AyIn going to market for titles I thought one lord as good as another  Furn  Of the same rank I grant you but a viscount is as much preferable to a baron as seven pearls on a coronet are to four which is almost two to one so that the odds in a match with lord Courtly will be greatly in your favour  Lomb  Then I'll be off with the baron  Furn  By all meansI'll take the first opportunity of making the proposal to my lord Courtly and depend on't you shall be return'd member for Gluttonbury  But here his lordship comes I'll introduce you to him  Enter lord  Courtly  introduced by a Servant  Furn  My lord Courtly you lordship's most obedient servant  Court  Well Furnival you arrived before me I seeSir  Bowing to  Lombard  who bows very low  Furn  The worshipful Mr Lombard my lord alderman of London Give me leave to present him to your lordship as a profess'd admirer of your character and virtues  Lomb  My lord your lordship's humble servant  Court  You are well met at Bath Mr Alderman what you are come for the waters I suppose You citizens live so luxuriously since the increased importation of turtle that you soon have a good excuse for visiting Bath  Lomb  No faith my lord that's not my errand now  Court  Pray what might bring you hither then Mr Lombard  Lomb  What brought me hither my lord my own carriage my lord my own carriage I assure you ha ha ha  Furn  That is Mr Lombard never travels in the stages my lord  Lomb  No never travel in the stages my lord except now and then to Hampstead or Camberwell when my horses are out of order  Court  Well Mr Alderman and pray what wind blew your carriage hither then  Lomb  Wind my lordgood again faith very good indeed It was a wind my lorda whirlwind my lord a whirlwind It took us up at Hydeparkcorner and set us down here at the town's endJehu we came envelop'd with clouds of dirt all the way  Court  I thought you were more tender of your horses Mr Lombard  Lomb  Ay my lord my own horses but these were hacks my lord hacks four legged machines that are wound up every morning with a few oats and a whisp of hay and set going along a turnpikeroad with a boy on their backs all day till like a Dutch clock they run themselves down at night Whywhysome of our heathen philosophers say we are not much better ourselves my lord ha ha ha  Court  It is Mr Alderman's way I presume to be jocular  Lomb  Nay my lord I hope no offence I use no ceremony to be sure And indeed as Mr deputy Purseproud says a man that has the revenue of a Subah in his pocket need not stand upon ceremony with any body but the Great Mogul  Court  True Mr Alderman therefore stand upon no ceremony with me  Lomb  I won't my lord I won't for though your lordship may be a great man at court I am a great man in the city and the courtiers and citizens have always been upon a footing to carry on a smuggling trade together It has been the custom time out of mind to make an exchange between your manners and our money my lord and egad you generally have had the better of the bargain too let me tell you that  Court  Your friend is quite a wit Barrister I did not think the spirit of raillery had been so prevalent within Templebar  Furn  Oh my lord there have been strange revolutions of late in the city The citizens have their wits and men of letters among them now a days as well as the courtiers  Lomb  Men of letters ay and letters of credit too my lord which is more than can be said by most of the literati at your end of the town Yes  my lord and we have made great improvements in the arts too  Court  Nay I thought the city was always famous for the arts  Lomb  What the arts of pinmaking and the manufacturing of thimbles ha ha ha No my lad no these have been long ago trundled down in the broadwheeled waggons to Birmingham to make room for architecture painting paving and sculpture  Court  Sculpture Mr Alderman sure the grim savages at St Dunstan's still stand centinel to strike the hours on the clockThen the giants in Guildhall look as tremendous as ever Gog and Magog are but bad proofs of your improved taste in sculpture Mr Alderman Those monuments of Gothic barbarism shou'd be demolished before you set up for Virtù  Lomb  Egad that's true I thank your lordship for the hint they must come down But you know my lord Rome was not built in a daybut when I come to be lordmayor or get into parliament  Court  How Sir not in parliament  Furn  It is indeed a loss to our country my lord a man of Mr Lombard's abilities cou'd not fail of making a shining figure  Lomb  You are very obliging Mr Furnival but though I am not at present in the house I hope with yours and his lordship's assistance I shan't be long out of it  Court  With my assistance Mr Alderman  Furn  Yes my lord Mr Lombard has offered himself a candidate for the borough of Gluttonbury in which I know your lordship has great interest  Court  Then you are better acquainted with my interest than I am BarristerI hope Mr Lombard does not mean to solicit my influence  Furn    To  Lombard  aside    You see his lordship is on the reverse Mr Lombard it wou'd be better perhaps  you were out of the way while I break the ice for you  Lomb  Egad like enough I'll leave you  aside to  Furnival    Why my lord to be sure I have but small pretensions but as a man who wou'd exert his utmost abilities in the service of his country if your lordship shou'd think favourably of me I shall be ready to fulfil any engagements Mr Furnival may enter into in my behalfAnd so my lord your lordship's most obedient  Going returns  And depend on't my lord that as soon as ever I come to the chair or get into the house I'll attack the giants  Exit  Court  Ha ha ha what a mixture of wit and absurdity Prithee Barrister what do you mean by bringing me acquainted with this heterogeneous animal You know I have no interest in his dirty borough of Gluttonbury  Furn  That's true my lord but he does not know it and as I am likely to reap some emolument from him myself my regard for your lordship suggested a thought may possibly be agreeable to you  Court  Take care Furnival of making my honour a cloak for your knavery you have done it too often even to the wearing it so threadbare that if I were not kept in countenance by the example of other persons of rank I should be really ashamed of myself  Furn  Nay but the present expedient is an honourable one my lord  Court  For the first then of your suggesting pray let us know what it is  Furn  You will excuse me my lord if I am mistaken as I don't mean to be impertinent but I own I conceived that either your lordship's constitution or estate might by this time have suggested the expediency of your entering again into the state of matrimony I took the liberty therefore to give a hint of your having such an intention to Mr Lombard  who has a marriageable daughter with whom he seems disposed to give at least sixty thousand pounds  Court  I understand you and so you would have me impose on him as having influence enough to get him returned member in order to prevail on him to accept me for a soninlaw a very honourable expedient truly  Furn  Why not my lord as I dare say we shall be sure of carrying our electionBut I beg pardon if your lordship does not choose  Court  I own Barrister there are prudential reasons for my repairing my fortune with that of a wife but so long as Narcissa keeps such hold of my heart I can't resolve on making my addresses to any other women  Furn  I thought my lord that her avowed preference of a rival had determined you to think no more of her  Court  I thought so too but I find my passion to be insuperable At the same time her mother gives me encouragement so that till her hand be actually given to another I cannot think of putting it out of my power to receive it  Furn  I am sorry my lord my intention to oblige you is frustrated  Court  And yet Furnival I stand in present need of your assistance I want money ready money to supply the common exigences of public places My cursed ill luck has made a beggar of me  Furn  Alderman Lombard will furnish you with any sum you require  Court  I am afraid not He knows better than to lend his money to a losing gamester without more substantial security than I can easily give him  Furn  Never sear my lord I will so manage him that he shall be your spaniel to fetch and carry and lay down his bankbills at your feet Don't your lordship see that Mr Lombard is a wit  Court  And do you urge that as a proof of his folly  Furn  I do my lordWhen animals are once out of their element their very strength degenerates into weakness A man's forte becomes his foible Now probity and plain common sense I take to be the proper element of worthy citizens and worshipful commoncouncilmen if any one of them soars therefore after artificial qualifications beyond those he becomes like a bladderblown fish that floats on the surface of the water till he is snapped up by a sea gull  Court  Well he is in good hands but be sparing of him as you canYou will let me know how you proceed  Furn  Assuredly my lord I can do nothing without you  Exeunt  SCENE II Mrs  Mildmay's  Lodgings  Enter Mrs  Mildmay  Mrs Mild  A little thought has calm'd my ruffled spiritsKind Providence I thank thee But whether thou hast gratified my longing eyes to make me happy or miserable thou only knowest If my once fond husband should still harbour his groundless resentment against me yet that I can remove by the clearest proofs of my innocencebut if thinking me unworthy of his heart he should indeed have bestowed it on another it were in vain to discover myselfNo if it be so I will retire from the world unseen and unknown  Enter  Sift  Sift  I am glad to find your ladyship so purely recovered Ma'amWhat could put you into such a tremulous taking  Mrs Mild  A sudden surprize SiftI thought I saw a gentleman supposed to have been dead and buried many years ago  Sift  Dead and buried Ma'am It must then have been his ghostDid I see it Ma'am I protest I begin to be surpriz'd too  Mrs  Mild No Sift it was no ghost the object I saw was certainly livinghis looks are hardly altered he is almost the same in appearance he was twelve years ago  Sift  O Lord Ma'am men are often so much alike in appearance that we might be sadly deceived indeed if we trusted to our eyesBesides Ma'am if he looks the same as he did twelve years ago he must either be a ghost or a sad cheat for there must be a prodigious difference in him in reality  Mrs  Mild Did you take notice of the gentleman who got into his coach at colonel Camply's door as we came by  Sift  In scarlet Madam with the mulatto servants Yes Ma'am some India governor or other I suppose or perhaps it is Sir John Melmoth Mr Frederic's fatherYou know Ma'am he was daily expected  Mrs Mild  No Sift that gentleman's name is not Melmoth  Enter a Servant  Serv  Doctor Mineral Madam  Exit Servant  Mrs Mild  Doctor Mineral  Sift  Yes Madam I sent for him in my flurry when your ladyship was ill  Mrs Mild  Well let him come up then  Exit  Sift    Now must I bear with a little formal impertinence  Enter Dr  Mineral  Min  Madam your most obsequiousI am extremely glad to find you better than I expected I should have been here sooner but  Mrs Mild  They need not have troubled you I believe doctor I was only taken with a fainting occasioned by a little surprize which is now gone off  Min  I don't know that Madam I don't know that Give me leave  Laying hold of her hand  I will be bold to say there is not a gentleman of the faculty has the tactus eruditus in a higher perfection than myself  Looking at Mrs Mildmay very earnestly  Why Madam you must have been terribly surprized indeed your very pulse is frighted out of its wits It is absolutely afraid to beat Low low very low upon my word  Mrs Mild  Indeed doctor I find myself too much indisposed to bear with trifling  Min  True Madam to be sure cases of this kind are not be trifled with I believe I have hit upon yours to an Iota Leave the remedy to meI only wish I had been sent for a little sooner though I should have been here at least half an hour ago had I not been detained at colonel Camply's  Mrs Mild  Colonel Camply's Sir  Min  Yes Ma'am I call'd in there as I was going my rounds this morning and was very agreeably detained by the conversation of a gentleman who has been these twelve years a Nabobhunting in Bengal and is now returned home loaden with the spoils of the chase one general Melmoth Madam who as far as I cou'd learn for I am never inquisitive is a very near relation if not own father to Mr Frederic Melmoth with whom you are well acquainted  Mrs Mild  Oh gracious providence  Min  You seem affected MadamI hope no return of your disorder  Mrs Mild  I fear it may doctor therefore if you think of any thing that may prevent it I shou'd be glad you wou'd hasten your prescription  Min  I will Madam your most obsequiousI shall dispatch my servant immediately with some of my nervous elixir Ma'am the most powerful analeptick in the whole materia medica  Exit  Mrs Mild  Can my eyes have deceived me Cou'd I mistakemistake the features of that well known faceAh no it was my husband He too hath changed his name thinking perhaps even still he killed his friend but Frederic Melmoth is he too my son is he Narcissa's brother If so how timely this discoveryO for a clue to guide me through the maze which yet I fear to enterYet I must know moreSift is close and trustyshe shall inquire into circumstances and if his hand and heart are not another's I may yet be happy  Enter  Sift  Come hither Sift  Sift  Yes Ma'am  Mrs Mild  That gentleman Sift we were speaking of who came out of colonel Camply's  Sift  Yes Ma'am  Aside  My lady's mightily concerned about this strange gentlemanShe cannot at her time of life surely be taken with a red coat and a featherPerhaps it is some old sweetheart Ha like enough  Mrs Mild  You observed him Sift  Sift  I did Ma'am a fine personable gentleman indeed  Mrs Mild  Doctor Mineral tells me his name is really Melmoth  Sift  I told you Ma'am you know how easily you might be deceivedAnd so Ma'am it was not  the person you imagined and you were frighted for nothing  Mrs Mild  The doctor tells me the gentleman we saw is young Melmoth's father  Sift  As I guessed Ma'am I have a remarkable good guess  Mrs Mild  But cou'd not you Sift enquire a little into particulars Mr Melmoth you know passes for an only son but if his father should marry again or be married alreadyor  Mrs Mild  True Ma'am but intrust me with the commission and I'll inform you of every thing you want to know I warrant you  Mrs Mild  Well then attend me presently at my toilet and I'll give you more particular instructions  Sift  And if I don't fulfil them if the gentleman has either man woman or child about him with a tongue in their heads say my name is not  Mrs Mild  But you'll mind Sift to be no less cautious than curious in your enquiries and communicate nothing of what you hear to any one but meAt the same time you may caution Susan and the rest of the servants to say nothing to the young ladies when they return of my sudden indisposition It is not expedient they should know any thing of the matter  Aside  'Till I know my own fate Narcissa shall be kept ignorant of hers  Sift  You may depend upon Sift Ma'am But I see a chair coming into the hall I fancy one of them is come home  Exit  Mrs Mild  Poor Narcissa If I were less anxious for myself I should be strangely concerned for her It may not be improper however to take some step to abate the ardour of her passion for Mr Melmoth as a lover  Enter  Narcissa  Narc  I see you are returned before me Madam  Mrs Mild  Yes my dear I seldom make my morning visits so long as yours I suppose you have been whiling away your time some where with Mr Melmoth  Narc  Nay I have not once set eyes on him today Though to say the truth Mamma I believe I waited for him half an hour or so at lady Pedigree's for as I expected he would call there I did not find myself hastily disposed to come away  Mrs Mild  And you promised to meet him there  Narc  He promised to meet me there  Mrs Mild  Fie NarcissaIs this keeping your promise with me Is this being more on the reserve  Narc  I did not think Madam you required me to alter my behaviour to Mr Melmoth  Mrs Mild  Indeed indeed Narcissa I do require it and if you have that sense of duty a fond mother could wish you to entertain you will not think I lay you under any severe restraint  Nar  Doth this new injunction proceed madam from the generally supposed want of discretion in me or from any particular reason you may have to change your good opinion of Mr Melmoth  Mrs Mild  Perhaps both You must have heard that Frederic hath been very wild he left the university at best but abruptly then he plays deep and it is very natural to suppose he may have intrigues enough to make it imprudent for a young woman to place too great a confidence in his professions of love  Narc  Bless us Madam you shock me Intrigues  Mrs Mild  Nay my dear don't be too much alarmed Mr Melmoth may be as deserving as most  young gentlemen of the age but for all that I would not have you set your heart upon him I have my reasons and those prevailing ones therefore reflect Narcissa and be well advised  Exit  Narc  Reflect and be well advised What need of so much reflection and advice My mamma hath surely met with something to ruffle her temper this morning I protest she is quite peevishNot set my heart on Mr MelmothThat advice comes now too late Yet still she seems to allow him as much merit as any young gentleman of the age How unreasonable is this If I am to be married at all can I expect a better husband than the market affords and if I am satisfied with my bargain what is that to my mamma I wonder Oh here he comes I'll rattle him off for not being where he promised and thence exposing me to this lecture  Enter Young  Melmoth  So Sir Frederic and lover of mine you are punctual to your appointments I see  Y Melm  Aside  Sir Frederic and with such formality too She hath heard of my loss then already  Turning to Narcissa  Yet I could not have thought my Narcissa would have triumphed over my misfortune I could not have thought she would so soon begin to upbraid and receive me coldly Oh woman woman  Narc  Hoity toity what's the matter now The man's seriously sorrowful as I live  Y Melm  Cruel Narcissa what can I think of this  Narc  Think of it Upon my word I am full as much at loss what to think of it as you are Sure the people are all at crosspurposes or are eat up with the vapours this morning My mama was here just now and peevishly chid me forsooth for being too kind to you and now you come in woful sadness  to complain of my cruelty What in the name of consistency am I to do with you both  Y Melm  I don't wonder Narcissa that your mama hath changed her thoughts of me A reverse of fortune is with fathers and mothers a sufficient motive for a reverse of sentiments But can they whose vows have been reciprocally exchang'd whose hearts have been once united can they my Narcissa be ever divided from motives of sordid interest What tho' my father be dead and through dotard fondness has reduced his son to beggary I have still friends real friends able and willing to serve me  Narc  Your father dead reduced to beggary I now understand you Sir  Aside  Disingenuous mama These then were your reasons for depreciating the character of my lover  To Frederic  Indeed Sir I beg your pardon I had heard nothing of your father's death nor of any change in your circumstances but I own the conversation I had just now with my mama a good deal surprized me  Y Melm  Then she must have heard it  Narc  No doubt of it and that accouuts for her behaviour  Aside  She may find however that people may sometimes be as much too reserved as too open  To Frederic  But can it really be Sir as you say  Y Melm  Too certainly though I received the news myself from my father's agent but this morning and came directly to impart it to you  Narc  Was that prudent to yourself at least was it impossible to conceal it from me 'till after our marriage  Y Melm  It was Narcissa though no human being had known it but myself Thoughtless and indiscreet as I am my heart is too faithful to you and too just to the world to suffer me to act the part of an impostor a single moment Nay I come now with a design to relinquish my pretensions 'till the happier circumstances  of some future day might entitle me to aspire to the heighth from which I am fallen  Narc  To give up your pretensions Mr Melmoth and was that so easy a task as to be readily resolved on  Y Melm  However rashly resolved you have seen it was not so easy to be executed For what have I done but solicit for that which I came to resign  Narc  And you would now marry me notwithstanding I may have fifteen thousand pounds to my fortune and you as you say not a farthing  Y Melm  Narcissa  Narc  Oh you hesitate do youTo he sure there is some little inequality of condition in the case but to let you see that I am more aspiring I am ready to venture with you on the same terms  Y Melm  And is it possible you can be so good as to rate my merit above your fortune  Narc  Nay don't give me time to weigh one against the other Money is heavy and worth is light you know if you take me at my word I shall keep it but if I am left to cool and ponderate I won't answer for myselfGrave faces and good advice may have a strange effect upon me At present I say I'll venture with you  Y Melm  Generous Narcissa But whether will you venture  Narc  Any whereto Scotland if you are so rash as to insist upon it  Y Melm  Spirited girl charming Narcissa but when  Narc  Now this very day as soon as you please My mama has dealt disingenuously by me I will therefore beg leave of duty to stand aside a little 'till I pay the debt I owe to love and honour If it be a fault I shall trust to her forgiveness this one time It is a fault one cannot make a practice of you knowSo come let us go in and concert proper measures for our expedition  Y Melm  Charming creature I'll accompany you to the world's end  Narc  O yes I intend you shall if we should live to the end of the world  Exeunt  SCENE III Young  Melmoth  's Lodgings  Enter  Syllogism  So so so I have been playing with a seeming dead coal that hath been all the while burning my fingers A plague of these potential cauteries say ISir John Melmoth it seems is really dead my young master is a beggar and I may carry his wallet Sic transit gloria mundi Had I thought the old baronet really defunct I should not have been so pleasant with the young one's circumstances But he is a deserving youth and though I am horribly disappointed in my own expectations I declare I am Iess sorry for myself than for himWhat will become of himFor my own part I am qualified to struggle with the worldOh here comes Sir Fredericin a mighty good humour too what the devil sure his father's not come to life again  Enter Young  Melmoth  Y Melm  Well Syllogism who hath called since I have been out  Syllog  Nobody SirI expected to have been able to present your honour with at least a hundred visiting cards full of compliments of condolance but I find the world is not so impertinent it civily chuses to leave people under misfortunes to comfort themselves  Y Melm  It is the improved mode of good manners Syllogism not to be troublesome You seem however to stand in need of consolation what's  the meaning of this It is not above an hour or two ago since you braved the storns of fortune with the fortitude of a stoick and recommended patience to me with the eloquence of a Seneca  Syllog  Yes Sir but like Seneca too I find I cou'd preach that to others which I cannot practice myself But surely Sir I may conclude from the pleasantry of your present disposition that what you heard in the morning cannot be true  Y Melm  True Syllogism How shou'd it be true when you know you observed it to be impossible  Syllog  Nay but Sir joking apart if your father be dead how do you intend to live now he has disinherited you  Y Melm  I shall do the best to supply my wants by industry I shall find friends to put me in a way and am only sorry it will be out of my power to reward your sidelity as it deserves  Syllog  Nay Sir make yourself easy about me a philosopher is easily provided for Jacta est alea Sir When I have the misfortune to leave your service I devote myself immediately to that of the muses  Y Melm  What turn poet then art thou condemned to be poor as long as thou livest Why the poverty of poets man is notorious it hath been a hackneyed jest for ages  Syllog  Yes Sir it hath been hackneyed so long that it is fairly worn out When poets had no patrons but the great the poor devils sure enough were obliged to live upon little but since the publick have taken them under their protection a bard like another man may have two coats to his back and every thing handsome about him  Y Melm  And yet Syllogism 'till the lawyers can decide the dispute about literary property  Syllog  I grant you Sir that a freehold on Parnassus does not intitle the possessor to vote for member of parliament but let a man of genius once merit the  favour of the town and he may levy contributions on it whenever his affairs require it  Y Melm  Levy contributions is not that too arbitrary I thought the convocation of criticks had something to do in the system of literary legislation  Syllog  Yes Sir they are the lower house and have the privilege of deciding in all moneymatters They hold their sessions in the pit at the representation of every new play and proceed directly to the consideration of ways and meansTo be sure Sir we cannot raise a shilling without the consent of the houseBut if they approve the bill they pass it with a plaudit and their generosity is boundless  Y Melm  Well Syllogism if you are obliged to go upon the town I can only wish you success but perhaps you may be better provided for yet in the mean time you must not leave me abruptlyI shall want your service for some time at least I am going a journey of three hundred miles an end will you go with me if I should have occasion for you  Syllog  Te duce Teucro to the antipodes Sir  Y Melm  Come this way then you must take a let er for me to Narcissa  Syllog  Of leave I suppose ah poor girl she'll be disappointed too Oh 'tis a bitter business  Exeunt  SCENE IV Colonel  Camply's  Lodgings  Enter General  Melmoth  and Colonel  Camply  G Melm  So then I find colonel you are engaged in a matrimonial expedition as well as my kinsman Well I wish you success and if you need my assistance command me  Camp  I thank you general and hope ere long to be able to return the compliment Come come  when you have recovered your spirits a little we shall have you looking out for a wife as well as we younger folks  G Melm  Ah my dear colonel  Sighs  Camp  Ah my dear colonel with a sigh too I have hit the mark then general What did you leave your heart in India or hath a sudden conquest been made of it since your arrival in Europe  G Melm  Neither Camply I was married many years ago and was too unhappy in that state ever to think of entering into it again even if I knew myself at liberty  Camp  I never heard you had been married general  G Mel  Yes colonel when I went over to India I left a wife and infant daughter in England behind me  Camp  And are they living  G Melm  Alas heaven knows I have heard nothing of them for years except from the very man of whom being absurdly jealous I thought I had killedHe came over with our troops some time ago to Bengal and convinced me by a number of corroborating circumstances that I had injured both him and my wife but to my sorrow he could give me no farther information of her  Camp  How fruitless then was that  G Melm  Fruitless as unhappy for though my heart was something lighter from knowing he had recovered of the wounds I had given him yet I shou'd have much easier supported the reflection of having killed an adulterer than that of having injured abandoned and perhaps ultimately destroyed am innocent wife and daughter  Camp  But why destroyed from this relation it is not impossible they may still be living  G Melm  I dare not flatter myself with such a suggestion Nay I hardly know whether I ought to wish it true for if she lives must she not long since have  transferred that heart to anothet which I so unjustly suspected so cruelly slighted  Camp  But what success has attended your enquiries since  G Melm  None though I have made every enquiry the distance of time and place would admit  Camp  Perhaps in your long absence thinking you were dead she may have married again and thus by her change of name have eluded your researches  G Melm  If it be so I will be no intruder on her happinessI will therefore carry on my future search in person that if I should succeed in it I may be enabled to act as circumstances shall determine But what a task How dreadful is't to seek that which we hope and yet we fear to find Though to be certain even of what we fear is better far than labouring still in doubt  Enter Servant  Ser  Mr Melmoth Sir desires to know if your honour is alone  Camp  Your kinsman general Shall he come up  G Melm  By all means He may have some business with you I'll retire into your study till you have done with him you know I have my reasons for declining to see him at present  Exit  Camp  How unlucky is thisI must not tell Melmoth who is so near and yet if I don't 'tis ten to one he'll say some extravagant thing or other which if overheard may give the general no good opinion of him I wish my old friend were at Bengal again only for one half hour with all my heart  Enter Young  Melmoth  Y Melm  My dear colonel how is it  Camp  Nay how is it with you You seem in raptures and it is not three hours ago since I left you in a state of despondency  Y Melm  Ay you grave rogue youyou stare to see a young fellow dejected at his ill luck in the morning intoxicated with his good fortune before noon But Narcissa's my own my boy  Camp  Who doubted it  Y Melm  No it wou'd have been a sacrilege to doubt itSo that as to my father  Camp  Nay but Mr Melmoth nothing against your father I beg of you  Aside  The general will certainly overhear himTo Melmoth Well but you did not tell Narcissa of your being disinherited  Y Melm  Did not IBut I did I told her the whole story  Camp  The deuce you did  Y Melm  Without omitting a single circumstance  Camp  Andandand  Aside  Egad I believe I had better ask him no more questionsHe seems in a humour to say any thing  Y Melm  Andandandwhat a plague do you mean by your andandandWhy do you look so confoundedly serious What the devil is the matter with youAh colonel colonel if you did but know all  Camp  Nay but I don't desire to know all  Aside  This spark's going to say some wild thing or other now  Y  Nay but you shall know all for I came on purpose to tell you  Camp  Well then some other time  Y Melm  No no other time will do for I intend to be in Scotland by to morrow night if possible  Camp  In Scotland  Y Melm  Ay I am going off with Narcissa to Scotland and am come to borrow your chaise if you'll lend it me  Camp  And what are you going to do there  Y Melm  Ha ha ha There's a question I thought every body knew what pennyless young fellows took girls of fortune to Scotland for  Camp  Well but  Y Melm  Nay nay will you lend me your chaise I'll tell you more of the affair by and byI shall want a couple of your servants too as for reasons of state I shall take none of my own with me  Camp  Yes if I am to see you againAside any thing to get rid of you now  To Melmoth  but I shall certainly see you again before you go  Y Melm  CertainlyCertainly  Exit  Colonel  Camply  solus  To Scotland egad Narcissa has an enterprizing spirit If the general hath overheard nothing of our conversation I must communicate this piece of intelligence to him it may perhaps induce him to vary his plan of operation and save them the trouble of the journey  Reenter General  Melmoth  G Mel  So colonel your young friend hath soon left youI thought I heard high words within I hope no new cause of discontent  Camp  Oh no Sir quite the reverse Your lively kinsman is now as much elated with joy as he was in the morning depressed with sorrow  G Mel  How so He can have heard nothing sure of the real state of his circumstances  Cam  Nothing at all but it seems he hath informed his mistress of his supposed loss of his father's fortune and she like a generous girl hath agreed to give him her own instead of it  G Melm  Indeed  Camp  They are just going to set off for Scotland he came to borrow my chaise  G Melm  And you shall lend it them or I will clap six horses to my own travelling coach and that shall convey them I like their spirit and would encourage their expedition were the young lady ev'n my own daughter  Camp  Nay but general why let them take so unnecessary a stepThey will certainly be better pleased if you should discover Mr Melmoth's real situation and prevent them  G Melm  I know not that No let them a while enjoy the satisfaction they feel in their mutual love and gratitude There is more pleasure in the display of true generosity than in the possession of mines of wealth Let them proceed therefore on their journey I warrant it will be a pleasant oneIn the mean time however if it be necessary I'll endeavour to reconcile the young lady's relations to the consequences of itBut come I called to take you home to dinner with me we will there toast the young couple and drink success to their spirited enterprize  Exeunt  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I Mrs  Mildmay  's Lodgings  Enter  Syllogism  and  Sift  meeting  Sift  So Mr Syllogism you are going to have old doings at your house I suppose  Syllog  No no Mrs Sift our old doings won't do any longer we must have new doings now if we intend to keep doing at all  Sift  What do you mean Mr Syllogism  Syllog  Nay what do you mean Mrs Sift if you come to that  Sift  Mean why rejoicings entertainments to be sure  Syllog  Rejoicings entertainments  Aside  O the jade has heard of our misfortune I find and has a mind to be merry with it  To Sift  You are pleased to banter I see Mrs SiftPray what should we rejoice at  Sift  Rejoice at why the arrival of Mr Melmoth's father from the IndiesHave you not expected him any time these six months  Syllog  Oh yes and he set out from thence it seems near a twelve month ago but which road he took or whether he is arrived at his journey's end is at present a little problematical  Sift  Problematical I am sure you scholars Mr Syllogism are very pragmatical Will you persuade  me I did not hear the bells ring for him this morning  Syllog  The bells ring for him O lud only think of tolling the bell at Bath for a man who died at Bengal  Sift  Dead Sir What would you insinuate  Syllog  What you know I find as well as I and therefore I may venture to tell youMy old master is dead and hath left my young one nothing to live upon  Sift  Nay nay Mr Syllogism I see you have a mind to banter me now but come to business You have brought something for Narcissa I suppose  Syllog  Yes I have got a letter for her  Sift  Takes the letter turns it about and holds it up to the light  Why there's no reading this letter without opening it  Syllog  What do you think it is sealed up for but to hinder you  Sift  Pooh I would not give a farthing to carry such letters Sealed What did you never open a letter without breaking the seal Did you never take off the impression on wax nor coax it with a hot tobacco pipe  Syllog  No Mrs Sift they are arts I have not been bred to  Sift  Well I have done it an hundred times who was never bred to the arts at all though I remember I once lost the best place I ever had in my life for breaking open a letter and sealing it up again with my thimble  Syllog  And deservedly  Sift  Yes I paid for my peeping that time it's true but I should have done it had I been to die for it I am astonished to think how any body can have so little curiosity as not to long to know every thing that other people want to keep from them  Syllog  I would as soon put my hand into my master's purse as pry into his secrets and think a servant deserves to be hanged as much for the one as the other  Sift  That is if it be done with intent to betray them Mr Syllogism but otherwiseand yet to be sure one does sometimes do a deal of mischief by getting into secrets by halves but that is the fault of one's masters and mistresses you know in not trusting us with the wholeYou will not pretend to tell me however that you have no curiosity to know your master's business  Syllog  Faith I have no curiosity to know more than he thinks proper to intrust me with I have plague and trouble enough with that if I knew less I should live a much easier life for what between his moneymatters and those of his mistress which you know Sift are both ticklish affairs I have but a very troublesome time on't  While Syllogism is speaking Sift is looking at the letter and turning it about in her hand  Sift  There must be something very curious Syllogism in this letter It is doubled into so many pleats and folded up as carefully as the Welchman's guineathere is certainly something choice in it  Syllog  Ay all love I suppose Sift  Sift  Love ehthat's choice stuff to be sure Well I see the direction  Syllog  And you'll deliver it safelyyou understand meyou need not be at the trouble of quartering my master's coat of arms with the milliner's  Sift  O the thimble no upon my honour  Syllog  You see the crest is a lion rampant beware of the top of your middle finger  Sift  Nay but when I say upon my honour Mr Syllogism  Syllog  I beg your honour's pardon Madam To be sure after having so frankly confessed its influence over your curiosity in these cases it wou'd be  cruel to distrust you  Aside as he goes out  If I had my letter again however I would as soon leave it with the printer of the Public Advertiser  Exit  Sift  solus  They think they are mighty close hereIt is written with lemon juice surelyWell I have a trick for that my mistress shan't set me upon the enquiry for nothing I am too good a servant for that too Ha our young ladies coming this wayI am determined to have another peep at it be the consequence what it will  Exit  Enter  Narcissa  and  Sophia  Narc  Well really Sophia this is something extraordinary that you shou'd affect to tutor me for disobedience to my mama in the preference I give to Mr Melmoth hath not she 'till this very day always approved of his addresses  Soph  Therefore I am afraid Narcissa she has some better reasons for her sudden change of behaviour than you are aware of at least I shou'd be for coming to a farther explanation with her before I took so irretrievable a step as you are going inconsiderately to do  Narc  Oh my dear we shall take a great many steps before we get to Scotland We shall not be across the Tweed so soon as we might be at the next parish church I shall have time to consider of it again and again therefore before the business is done yetNay I can assure you that even when we get there if I shou'd not happen to be perfectly of the opinion I am in at present we may come back again no wiser than we set out If the matrimonial apparatus does not wear a very agreeable aspectif MessJohn does not put on one of his best faces and his cleanest bandor  Soph  Nay but be serious  Narc  Well I am and say as I did before that if there were really any thing wrong in what I am going to do you shou'd be the last person in the world my dear Sophy to dissuade me from it  Sopht  Why so  Narc  Because I should never listen to a lecture on disobedience from one as disobedient as myself  Soph  How cannot I entertain a proper regard for colonel Camply without incurring the guilt of disobedience I don't intend to run away with him or even to marry him without my father's consent  Narc  Not unless he refuses to give it you there is no occasion for't my dear But if by a proper regard you mean that the colonel is in possession of your heart I warrant your hand will soon follow And tho' you may want courage to scamper away to the North before you come of age you may only have just patience enough to stay in the South 'till you do when we shall find you sneaking into the backdoor of Walbrookchurch or St Swithins to commit the like horrid sin of disobedience  Soph  I find my dear there is no talking to you on this subject so like a naughty girl you must go on your own way  Narc  And you like a naughty girl Sophy wou'd go my way too if you dar'd  Enter  Sift  Sift  The devil take the inventors of sealingwax and invisible inkI can pick nothing out of this letter so I think may as well give it to my young mistress If she can read it I may possibly pick something of it out of her and that will do as wellA letter for you Madam  gives Narcissa the letter  Narc  From Mr Melmoth  Sift  Yes Madam  Narc  You will excuse me Sophy I must go and read my billetdoux it may possibly require an answer  Exit  Sift  Speaking aside as she follows Narcissa  Sonow for a peep over the left shoulderLet the writing be but any how visible and if young madam reads any more of it than I why then I am grown shortsightedthat's all  Exit  Sophia  solus  Was ever any thing so determinedly inconsiderate and yet Narcissa does not want for prudence when the vivacity of her temper will suffer her to make use of itI wish I cou'd any how prevent this rash expedition without betraying the confidence she has placed in me  Exit  SCENE II The Parade  Enter Lord  Courtly  and  Furnival  Court  Urge this affair no farther Furnival I can be of no service to you in itI have consulted my heart and find it repugnant to all my sentiments The love I bear Narcissa and the regard due to my own honour both forbid it  Furn  Give me leave to say my lord your scruples are too refined for a man so well acquainted with the world  Court  Yes barrister I know the world too well to sacrifice so much of my own happiness either to its pleasures or opinions as I have done  Furn  But if your lordship has no hopes of Narcissa what objection can be made to your repairing your fortune by marrying another Surely my lord neither the laws of love or honour forbid this  Court  Perhaps not but I feel an invincible reluctance to the making my addresses elsewhere It is  true Narcissa herself gives me no encouragement but her mother is still my friend and affords me hopes that something may turn out in my favour I have even just now received a message from her desiring to see me in the evening on particular business Who knows what may have happened But be it as it may I cannot resolve to devote myself to another 'till it be impossible for Narcissa to be mine  Furn  And your lordship is determined to decline the obliging offers of Mr alderman Lombard with regard to the money matters I was speaking of  Court  If they are made on a presumption that I shall serve him where I have neither the power nor inclination  Furn  I am heartily sorry for it my lord as this is not the way to pay off the mortgage on your estate  Court  Then it must remain unpaid barrister 'till a more honourable method offers for its discharge  Exit  Furnival  solus  His lordship is in one of his moral moods to day I must resume the subject at a gayer moment And yet I'm half afraid he's lostThese partial attachments to the sex are the ruin of many a noble spirit While he was only a general lover he was the most enterprizing genius on the turfBut now'Tis strange but we sometimes find it in the power of one virtuous woman to reform in a few months what the libertine part of both sexes have been labouring to corrupt for yearsThese modest wenches make as many converts as the methodist parsonsWhom have we herethe very ladies in question as I liveand engaged in earnest discourseIt may be worth listening to I have an excellent knack of hearing at a distance  Retires  Enter  Narcissa  and  Sophia  Soph  And you are really determined Narcissa to put this wild scheme in execution  Narc  Positively my dear SophiaI shall not break my word with Mr Melmoth if he keep his with me We are to have your colonel's chaise waiting for us at the town's end I shall just go to the rooms with you for form's sake and see you set in for cards and then vanish slip into a chair and be with my spark in a twinkling leaving you my dear or your colonel to make the best apology you can for me to my mamaI have left a short one indeed myself in a letter she will find on her return in the evening  Soph  As you have made me your confident my dear I shall not betray you But I cannot say I approve of this step Indeed I really think it unnecessary I am certain your mama might be brought to give her consent to your marriage  Narc  Nay then there is the less harm my dear in going to be married without it If she has no objections you know but what might be removed by solicitation the solicitation would be merely a matter of form a piece of childish ceremonyBesides my dear Sophy to answer all your petty scruples about disobedience at once I am determined on the thing precisely because I would not be disobedient  Soph  Ay make that out Narcissa  Narc  Very plainlyMy mama has not yet positively told me she would not have me marry Mr Melmothon the contrary she has hitherto encouraged his addresses but as I shrewdly suspect she might tell me so in plain terms the next time we converse on the subject I don't intend to give her an opportunity of laying me under any such injunction Because in that case you know it would be  downright disobedience to act directly against her positive commands  Soph  Well for such a madcap thou art certainly a very extraordinary casuistSo joy go with you  Narc  I warrant it will I only wish we may bring it back again and make it last as long as the wedding ring and the parson's benizon hold us together So come along  Exeunt  Reenter Mr  Furnival  So so soHere's an affair broke out What will his scrupulous lordship say to this Egad we just nicked the time The bird is feathered and just on the wing But the lime and twigs shall be ready my dear No no my pretty flutterer you must not take flight and leave us yet neitherWhat if I worked by stratagem and entrapped my little lapwing in her own snare Her chairmen may possibly be prevailed on to mistake the place of rendezvousIf I can but decoy her to his lordship's apartments he may set her at liberty himself if he chuses it It is a pretty Canarybird and would become a gilt cage mightily  Exit  SCENE III Mrs  Mildmay  's Lodgings  Enter Mrs  Mildmay  with an open letter in her hand followed by  Sift  and  Susan  Mrs Mild  To Scotland and with young Melmothrash unadvised girlDispatch somebody to colonel Camply Tell him I must speak with him instantly on business of the utmost censequence  Susan  Yes Madam  Exit  Mrs Mild  Oh Narcissa  Walking about in disorder  Sift  But why Madam should you make yourself so very uneasy Mr Melmoth is a worthy young gentleman  Mrs Mild  Talk not to me of his worth  Sift  And the young people heaven bless them were passionately fond of one another  Mrs  Mild  Ah too passionately  Sift  Then Mr Melmoth is  Mrs Mild  You know not what he is Sift nor can I tell you  Enter Servant  Serv  My lord Courtly Madam  Mrs Mild  Shew him up  Exit servant  See that colonel Camply be found immediately Sift  Exit Sift  Enter Lord  Courtly  Oh my lord I am the most terrified and distressed of women The delight of my heart the wish of yours my darling Narcissa  Court  Narcissa what of Narcissa Madam you alarm me beyond expression Surely no accident  Mrs Mild  Yes the most dreadful accident in the most sudden and unexpected manner is she gone off with young Melmoth for Scotland  Court  Then are my hopes at an end  Mrs Mild  Not so my lord if their design be prevented They cannot be got far as yet Your lordship will assist me in immediately pursuing them  Court  If my preventing Narcissa's marriage with Mr Melmoth might induce her to bestow her heart on me Madam you might command me but I fear hearts are not to be transferred and she has now  given a sufficient proof on whom she has freely bestowed hers I cannot therefore think of robbing another of what he has so good a right to possess because I had not the merit of a successful rival  Mrs Mild  Alas my lord Mr Melmoth can be no rival  Court  You flattered me indeed Madam with the discovery of a circumstance in my favour  Mrs Mild  It is this very circumstance my lord that aggravates my present distresses as I now fear that instead of contributing to your happiness it will only tend to my misery  Court  What is it then Madam  Mrs Mild  In the present situation of things my lord I cannot refuse to impart it to you though I have reason for concealing it a while from all the world besidesMr Melmoth isNarcissa's brother  Court  Narcissa's brother  Mrs Mild  By the most providential means I this day discovered it therefore my lord  Court  Nay Madam if that be the casebut are you

account of my time Your servants will assist me to procure the means of pursuit and be assured you shall speedily hear from me  Mrs Mild  One thing more my lord If either persuasion or force may effect their return let the circumstance of their affinity be as yet kept a secret from them I have particular reasons for it  Court  I shall obey your commands Madam  Exit  Mrs Mild  Who waits there John Thomas attend upon his lordshipWell now I am something easier The inconsiderate sugitives will be  overtaken Inconsiderate indeed but alas had it been otherwise how innocent had been their crime Yet happy is it that through all the various accidents of life there is an overruling providence which often preserves us from the ill consequences even of our own indiscretions  Exit  SCENE IV A Street near Lord  Courtly's  House  Enter  Furnival  disguised in a Cloak followed by a chair with the curtains drawn  Furn  This way Patrick  In a low voice and exit  st Chairm  Which way your honour pleases  d Chairm  Ay I thought young madam would not be after going out of town to night  Exeunt  Enter  Syllogism  half drunk  Syllog  What a roundabout way have these fellows taken but I was only bid to follow them and and so ite pre sequar  Going off stops short  Hey day they turn into a houseSure that is more than we bargained forI hope there is no mistake hereDrinking to besure depresses the judgment though it elevates the imagination if potation however deprives a man of his discretion it gives him courage to face the peril it leads him into Not that I am so tipsy as to be very valiant neither though I did get rather a cup too much in waiting ere the dogtrotting scoundrels were put in motionBut I have classical authority for taking a chearful glass in the evening Ut vites poenam de polibus incipe caenam  Enter young  Melmoth  Y Melm  Syllogism What are you doing here Where is Narcissa Did not I bid you watch her coming out of the rooms and follow her chair  Syllog  You did Sir and so I have It is just gone into that house  Y Melm  Into a house you must have mistaken some other chair for her's What a blockhead why you're half drunkyou can't see  Syllog  No no Sir it is no deception as sure as you stand there I saw the chair that brought Narcissa from the rooms go into that house  E Melm  Is't possible For heaven's sake who lives there  Syllog  Why Sir that I was posing myself about when you came in  Y Melm  As I live lord Courtly's old lodgings  Syllog  Yes Sir and now I recollect I believe his new ones too I think I saw some of his servants about the door today  Y Melm  Was she brought hither by her own direction  Syllog  Faith Sir I can't tell but it certainly must be with her own consent or otherwise she would have prevented it  Y Melm  And why did not you  Syllog  Nay Sir you know my orders were only to see the chair safe where it was carried to and there to leave it So Sir I walked a chalk after it as still as a mouse all the way  Y Melm  But you knew whither it was going why did not you make the fellows keep strait forward  Syllog  Upon my word Sir I found it a little difficult to keep quite strait forward myself Besides Sir I thought these fellows must know their way about the town better than I did  Y Melm  What can be the meaning of this Sure Narcissa does not intend to jilt me to give her hand to lord Courtly after all O no that is impossible  Goes out at the side of the scene looking up at the house  Syllog  Impossible ah Sir so you said you know when you heard of your father's death but under correction Sir it is just as possible for a young lady to give away her heart as for an old gentleman to give up the ghostInconstancy and intemperance are both fatal in their consequences  Hicups  But then those consequences are so very common that there are matches broke off and funerals performed to every part of England daily and for that matter Sir under correction  Y Melm  Returning  Ha the door opens stand back Syllogism somebody is coming  They retire to the back of the scenes  Narcissa  and  Furnival  Narc  Speaking entering  I insist upon going Sir let go my hand Sir What is the meaning of this insolence  Furn  You must not risk the danger Madam of going at this time of night alone  Narc  I can be no where in so much danger as in staying with you  Furn  Nay but Mr Melmoth will be here immediately Madam  Y Melm  Coming forward  He is here already Sir  Furn  Ha  Narc  Oh Mr Melmoth what a villainous trick has been play'd us  Y Melm  Pray Sir how came this lady here and to what purpose  Furn  You shou'd ask the one of the chairmen who brought her Sir and the other of the lady who doubtless directed them  Y Melm  Come Sir no shuffling How came you to mention my name as a pretence for detaining  herExpect to be called to a severe account for this piece of treachery  Furn  Faith Sir my design was merely to oblige my friend lord Courtly in preventing the lady's elopement  Y Melm  And what right had either you or he Sir to pry into or controul her actions  Furn  Nay Sir I shall not enter into the matter of right as the lady has nothing to complain of but being prevented committing an act of disobedience But yonder I see comes my lord himself with the servants of the family to conduct the young lady home  Y Melm  Confusion how cou'd we be thus betray'd  Narc  Betray'd indeed and by what infamous means I did not think my lord Courtly cou'd have descended to such baseness or my mama have abetted it But they shall reap no advantage from the success of itLead the way Mr Melmoth and I'll follow you through all opposition  Y Melm  Syllogism stand to your arms  Syllog  Yes Sir and I'll make any body else stand too or fall that offers to molest you  Brandishing a cudgel  Enter Lord  Courtly  with servants  Court  Ha Narcissa and Mr Melmoth fortunate encounter  To the servants  Stand back till you are called for  Servants retire  Y Melm  Perhaps not so fortunate as you imagine my lord  Court  For you I am sure it is and as for myself the service I may do you both will at least entitle me to your gratitude  Narc  If you are serious my lord your absurdity borders on impertinence if you mean to be ironical you are extremely ridiculous  Court  I flatter myself Madam you will soon think otherwise and that however unsuccessful I have hitherto been I shall for my assiduity to night be rewarded with your good opinion  Narc  Indeed my lord you are egregiously mistaken What extravagance To employ your base parasite to decoy me to your house and flatter yourself to obtain my good opinion of it Indeed indeed my lord this is one of the grossest instances of selfadulation I ever met with  Court  Decoy you to my house Madam I don't understand you  Furn  Indeed Madam  To Narcissa  I can answer for his lordship's innocence in that particular  Narc  Yes yes we shall certainly take your word for his innocence  Y Melm  Be prepared Sir to answer for your own But come Narcissa  offering to go  we lose time  Court  interposing  Let me intreat you not to be too precipitate Mrs Mildmay entreats nay insists that you will proceed no farther without consulting your friends  Y Melm  One of which I presume is to be your lordship No no my lord we have lost too much time by your contrivance alreadyTherefore stand aside if you please  Court  Nay but for your own sakes  Narc  For our own sakes my lord or yours Ha ha ha  Court  This is no place to enforce my own pretenions I act now only in obedience to Mrs Mildmay who charged me to say that all laws human and divine oppose your union  Y Melm  Very pathetic indeed my lord Ha ha ha  Furn  Aside  I must second this motion  to young Melmoth  Yes Sir and as the lady is a minor the laws of England too  YMelm  Oh Sir we shall not venture to break the laws of England 'till we get into Scotland so that you may spare your rhetorick  Court  On my honour Madam you cannot be the wife of Mr Melmoth  Narc  But I suppose I might be your's my lord if I aspired to that dignity and so in return for your extraordinary friendship I promise you that when I find I cannot be Mr Melmoth's I will give my hand to your lordship  Court  If I should take you at your word Madam  Narc  I will certainly keep it and so now I hope you are satisfied  Going  Court  But Narcissa  Narc  Your humble servant my lord  Court  Mr Melmoth  Y Melm  My lord your most obedientCome Narcissa we'll take this waypoor lord Courtly Ha ha ha  Exit young Melmoth and Narcissa  Court  Madness and folly How rash and resolute At all hazard they must be prevented Mrs Mildmay must unfold the secretAdvance thereBarrister pursue and detain them till I return with the lady's mother  Exit  Furn  Follow me  Furnival and servants going  advance  Syllog  advancing  Hold hold Mr Barrister not a step farther if you pleaseand you gentlemen keep back I charge you as you set a store by your respective pericraniums  Brandishing his endgel the sevents make a shew of resisting with their sticks  Furn  What does the fellow mean  Syllog  I'll shew you that Mr Lawyer  Throwing open his great coat and shewing a blunderbuss slung over his shoulders  Do you see this curious piece of casuistry it contains very weighty reasons against you I assure you  Furn  A blunderbuss loaded with slugs I suppose a powerful way of arguing indeed  Syllog  This Sir is the ultima ratio dialectici and and is the most effectual argumentum ad hominem in the whole system of logic  Presents the piece to the servants who start back  Furn  Is the man mad or drunk  Serv  Be which he will Sir we had better retire for fear of mischief  Syllog  Yes Sir you had better take good advice and retire for fear of mischief  Furn  Wou'd the wretch commit murder  Syllog  Not downright murdrum Mr Barrister as you wou'd call it but being a little inebriated one's hand is liable to shake and this damned trigger here has no catch  Plays with the lock of the piece with the mouth turned towards  Furnival    Besides Sir I am placed here upon duty and by all the rules of war and logic if you proceed vi et armis I must oppose you by the same mode of ratiocination therefore give up the point ye scoundrels  Turning round and presenting the piece at the servants  or I will let fly such a shower of majors and minors among you that shall make you tremble for the consequences  The servants run off  Furn  What all gone then I think I may as well withdraw my plea too His lordship will certainly be nonsuited  Sneaks off  Syllogism  solus  So the enemy hath made his retreat and the day's my own Egad I think I have displayed my prowiss pretty well hereI hope by this time my general hath carried off the spoils of the field and then I shall have nothing to do but make an end of my supper and sing Te deum for the victory with a health to the KingTol de rol tol de rol  Shoulders his blunderbuss and struts off singing the tune of the Belleisle march  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE  the  Parade  Enter general  Melmoth  and colonel  Camply  General Melmoth  THAT was unlucky coloneland so the young folks were intercepted in their flight  G Camp  By the lady's mother Sir who being early informed of their intention was by the aid and advice of lord Courtly at the place of rendezvous before they set off For my own part apprehensive that my assistance would be called for I purposely kept out of the way  G Mel  And how takes my kinsman his rival's interposition in this affair Have you seen him to day  C Cam  Just now and horribly mortified at his disappointment I assure you He had just dispatch'd a note to lord Courtly  G Mel  A challenge ha colonela mettled spark But we must have no fighting if it can be decently prevented the consequences may be fatal  C Cam  I don't see how Mr Melmoth can recede general he must call his lordship to account for his last night's misbehaviour  G Mel  Well but you may be his second colonel and prolong the ceremonials 'till I have had some talk with the young lady's mother I promised yesterday to endeavour to conciliate matters with her relations had she gone off with my kinsman to Scotland  I can do no less than try how far my influence may extend now If Mrs Mildmay's objections to young Melmoth be merely founded on his supposed want of fortune they are readily obviated and if lord Courtly be as you say a man of sense and principle he will give up the point and no longer endeavour to divide two young people whose hearts seem form'd for each other O here comes Mr Alderman Lombard  G Mel  I had a meeting with him last night to settle the affair of my executorship when I took an opportunity to mention yours with his daughter Sophia as also your electioneering business in which he does not meet with the encouragement he expected so that you may not find him so refractory as you imaginedI have taken some steps towards your reconciliation  C Cam  This is so kind and obliging in you general  G Mel  Nay no compliments my dear colonel while dead to family connexions myself I live but for the service of my friends  Enter alderman  Lombard  Goodmorrow Mr Alderman  Lomb  Goodmorrow to you general  to Camply  your humble servant Sir  G Mel  Colonel Camply Mr Lombard a gentleman extremely desirous of a more intimate acquaintance with you  Lomb  I know it SirTho' a stranger to his person I am none to his name and pretensions  G Mel  To both which Sir I hope you will soon be reconciled  Lomb  I don't know that SirYou set up for a borough it seems that I want to get for myself  C Cam  I do Sir at the general request of the constituents  Lomb  And you put up for a daughter too whom perhaps I have a mind to keep to myself  G Mel  What if you can dispose of her to advantage and make her happy in a good husband Mr Lombard No no I dare say you are too good a father for that  Lomb  Why to be sure general if I could promote her happiness and my influence in the borough at the same time  G Mel  Both which I dare say you will in conciliating matters with my friend the colonel You own Mr Lombard the force of the arguments I made use of last nightI shall now therefore leave the discussion of the matter to yourselves having some business of consequence to dispatch elsewhere Mr Lombard your most obedient  Exit  Lomb  General your servantWell young gentleman what is it you have to propose  C Cam  Sir if you please to step to my lodging we may there talk the matter over a little  Lomb  Look'ye Sir if you love my daughter you must give up the borough  C Cam  Sir I have the highest regard for both and doubt not I shall be able to satisfy you  Lomb  I am not so soon satisfied Sir  C Cam  This way Sir if you please  Lom  My daughter or the borough Sir take your choiceSophy or Gluttonburymind I stick to that  Exeunt  SCENE II Mrs  Mildmay's  Enter Mrs  Mildmay  and  Sift  Mrs Mild  Well Sift and can you learn whether the story Mr Melmoth hath told Narcissa be true  Sift  O lord Madam it is exactly as I guess'd yesterday What Mr Melmoth told Narcissa Mr Syllogism told me but I knew it was a sib the moment I heard it  Mrs Mild  But how are you assur'd of it today  Sift  From colonel Camply's own mouth madam who call'd me into the parlour this morning and began to catechise me like a schoolmaster Mrs Sift says he what makes you abroad so early What your ladies have sent you out upon the enquiry I suppose I know they are curious and inquisitiveIndeed Sir says I you know no lady in our house half so inquisitive as myself Well says he what's the news then at home Why Sir says I we hear that Mr Melmoth's father is dead and has disinherited him Disinherited him says he an idle story Sift an idle story there is nothing in itSo I thought an please your honour said I for I understood Mr Melmoth was son to the strange gentleman who visited you yesterday Ay Sift says he while that gentleman lives Mr Melmoth's fortunes are in the hands of a fatherOh ma'am I'm positively certain it is as I first suggested  Mrs Mild  Then so far all is well but did you learn nothing more  Sift  Oh yes ma'am you wanted to know if the gentleman was married or not but that seems to be a doubt  Mrs Mild  A doubt Did colonel Camply say it was a doubt  Sift  No madam I did not think that a proper question to put to the colonel But Mrs Tiptoe his honour's housekeeper with whom I had a little confab afterwards overheard the gentleman tell her master yesterday that he was married  Mrs Mild  How then is it a doubt  aside  Oh no my fears are true and I must still be wretched  Sift  Why it seems madam the gentleman has lost his wife  Mrs Mild  Lost her How  Sift  Nay ma'am I know nothing more than that he can't find her so that at least she is lost to him He has not seen her I find these twelve years past though by his own account which is a little extraordinary he has been looking for her almost from one end of the world to the other  Mrs Mild  Good heavens my hopes revive  Sift  The colonel advises him if he don't find her soon to look out for another but he is one of your constant swains it seems and declares that if his first love cannot be found she shall certainly be his last Whether the gentleman will keep his word or not is another affair But this is all I could learn of the matter madam as it stands at present  Mrs Mild  I am satisfied  aside  Is he then true to one he thought unfaithful and can he still remember me with tenderness  to Sift  Go leave me Sift I see Narcissa coming  Exit Sift  Enter  Narcissa  Well Narcissa I hope that on reflection you are convinc'd of the danger and impropriety of your behaviour Think my dear into what frightful perils your indiscretion had betray'd you Believe me child such unadvis'd proceeding differs little from wilful disobedience  Narc  Indeed madam I shudder at the reflection and am hardly recover'd from the terrour into which your relation had thrown meBut with regard to Mr Melmoth's affinity how was it possible for me to have any suspicion of it  Mrs Mild  It certainly was not but in a matter of so much importance you should not have acted so precipitately  Narc  Nor should I mama had not you been so much on the reserve and spoken of Mr Melmoth so disrespectfully yesterday morningBut for the future I am all obedienceHow would you have me behave to him nowas you said so little to him last night he will undoubtedly make me a visit this morning How am I to resist his solicitations without giving him my reasons for it  Mrs Mild  Cannot you turn the conversation on another subject I shall now very soon come to an explanation with your father  Narc  My father madam  Mrs Mild  Yes Narcissa that longlost father whom you have heard me so often lament is now in Bath I saw him yesterday by accident and today intend to procure an interview which should have been over before I had imparted this circumstance had not your last night's adventure anticipated the discovery of Mr Melmoth's being your brother  Narc  But is it not strange madam that he should say nothing to me of his father's arrival But on the contrary should tell me he was dead and had disinherited him  Mrs Mild  I cannot divine his reasons for such behaviour But men in love Narcissa are strange creatures He might do it possibly to make a trial of your regard for him  Nar  It must have been a scheme sure to mislead me into that dangerous project of elopement which might have prov'd so fatal  Mrs Mild  It might be so and therefore it would not be amiss my dear if you affect to resent it as such nay I would have yon do it were it only to give a preparatory check to his passion before he knows that you're his sister It will be improper for me to see him yet as well in regard to what has pass'd as to the danger of betraying a mother's affection too soon I must speak first with your father  Narc  In what a situation then madam do you leave your Narcissa Is it for me to act so hard a part Can I affect to treat with disregard the man so late I lov'd Alas I find his image wanting here The void it left no brother can supplyOh my poor heart  Mrs Mild  I share my dear Narcissa your distress and would not task you with a mother's weakness But for this once call up your resolution an explanation yet were prematureBut here he comesI must retire  Exit  Narc  Then let my duty teach me to dissemble  Enter young  Melmoth  As he enters Narcissa and alone I feared this happiness had been denied meMy dear Narcissa I am glad to see you look so charmingly todayI was afraid the ill success of our last night's adventure might have had an effect upon your spirits  Narc  In a trembling voice being greatly disturbed  Not at all Sir I never was in better spirit in my life  Y Mel  Indeed I wish I could say sobut our unlucky disappointment  Narc  Still in perturbation  Unlucky  Y Mel  Cruelly so we might ere this have been halfway on our journey and in a few hours more at the end of itwhere we might have put it out of the power of accident to part us  Narc  For that very reason Mr Melmoth may it not be as well we were preventedWhat to be tied together for life never to be parted Might we not in time have been tir'd of one another and after that have been most disagreeable companions  Y Mel  Glad we were prevented tir'd of one another disagreeable companions How different is this language and this behaviour Narcissa to that of yesterday  Narc  What if I should have chang'd my mind since yesterday Sir  Y Mel  Chang'd your mind Narcissa  Narc  Is it impossible SirDid you never hear of a woman's changing her mind  Y Mel  Yes madam I have heard of wonderful changes in women's mindsbut you are not in earnest Narcissa  Narc  Indeed Sir I am at present in no disposition for jesting  Very gravely and confused as through the whole scene  Y Mel  And you are really glad we were prevented going to Scotland to be married Surely you dissemble with me  Narc  Not in that believe me SirI would not have gone off with you to Scotland and been married to you for the world  Y Mel  Nay then there is a change indeedBut for heaven's sake why What can have work'd this astonishing alteration What have I done or said or thought How am I chang'd that such a change should have happened in you Some villain envious of my happiness must have unjustly traduc'd and blacken'd my reputation  Narc  Why something has been said of you it must be confess'd But it was so far from being to your disadvantage that had I never had any knowledge of you before it would have induc'd me to love and esteem you as a brotherBut with regard to your own behaviour to me Mr Melmoth I  must own it has been very exceptionable How could you tell me Sir that your father was dead  Y Mel  He is Narcissa  Narc  Fie fie Mr MelmothI am well assur'd your father is still living and must freely declare that were there not another man in the world I would not give my hand to his son  aside bursting into tears  Now I hope my mama will be satisfied  Exit  Y Mel  Do I live Am I awake  looking after her with astonishment  Was that Narcissa or am I Frederic Melmoth What can be the meaning of all thisIf she be lost I know at least who to thank for itLord Courtly shall pay dear for this officiousness I must and will have this behaviour explained  Exit  SCENE III Another apartment in the same house  Enter General  Melmoth  shewn in by a servant  Serv  Please to walk this way SirMrs Mildmay desires to be at present excus'd but my young mistress will wait on you immediately  Exit servant  Enter  Narcissa  G Mel  Madam your most obedient  Nar  Aside  Another painful task Is this my father certainly it ishe strikes me with an awe I never felt before  G Mel  I am sorry madam I cannot have the pleasure of seeing Mrs Mildmay  Nar  Hesitating and confused as thro' the whole of this scen  ▪  You have then business with my mama Sir  G Mel  I have madam but as you are principally concerned in it I shall with your leave impart it to you  Nar  If it be of immediate consequencc Sir otherwise I should rather  G Mel  Nay but young lady it is of consequence and to you too I am not to learn with regard to your late generous behaviour to Mr MelmothI am a relation of his and apprehending your last night's disappointment might have some disagreeable consequences which I am able to remove I have taken the liberty of the present intrusion  Narc  This openness of behaviour on your part Sir would be a reproach to any mean reserve on mine But I am only at liberty to say that the disappointment as you call it was a fortunate one  G Mel  Is it possible you can think so Then must I have been misinform'd  Narc  You will excuse me Sir but my mama hath fully convinc'd me that my intended marriage with Mr Melmoth would have been highly improper  G Mel  Improper  Narc  Dreadful  G Mel  You astonish me madamDreadful What new folly hath he committed then to what baseness descended that should make an alliance with him deserving such an epithet  Narc  Don't mistake me SirI have still the highest esteem for Mr Melmoth but my mama  G Mel  Objects to his want of fortune I know it But if I convince her she is mistaken  Narc  Yet even then Sir notwithstanding the sincere regard I still entertain for Mr Melmoth and the great respect which though a stranger I feel for yon I could not be induc'd to listen to the solicitations of eitherNo Sir I never can marry any man who calls you fatherBut I can explain myself no farther My mama is by this time disengag'd and will herself attend you  Exit  G Mel  What is all this Respect for menot marry any man who calls me fatherI am not young  Melmoth's father and if I were what thenunless but here comes the mother she may speak more plainly  Enter Mrs  Mildmay  Who stands at a distance and looks at him with tenderness  I beg pardon madam but  bowing ceremoniously and advancing 'till looking full in

never never  Mrs Mid  Hast thou forgiven me too  G Mel  Forgiven thee loveWhy thou didst never wrong me  Mrs Mild  Indeed I did not even when you thought me guilty I was innocent  G Mel  I know thou wast and 'tis in knowing that that I've so long been wretchedYes thou wast innocent but it was I 'twas I forgot the father and the husband and wrong'd both thee and thine  Mrs Mild  Yet I was indiscreet and much to blame  G M  Idle recrimination no you never were to blameand yet your name is Mildmay  Turning from her  Mrs Mild  Nay turn not from meI perceive your doubts but they are vain and groundless my name's assum'd like thineFor your embraces  form'd and yours alone these have been widow'd arms e'er since you lest me  G Mel  My faithful wife Come then again to mine and dwell for ever there  Embracing  Mrs Mild  Alas my love this meeting's like a vision You seem as one new risen from the dead  G Mel  'Tis the reunion of departed souls favour'd by heav'n to meet again above with joy unutterable  Mrs Mild  Oh let us then thank heav'n for such a meeting  G Mel  I cannot thank it better than I do Heav'n knows the heart and from the fulness of my present joy sees mine o'erflow with gratitude  Enter  Narcissa  Mrs Mild  Narcissa come and take a father's blessing  G Mel  Is this my daughter too  Narc  Oh my father  Kneeling  G Mel  I will but need not bless thee Heaven hath been so much kinder to thee than thy father  Raises her up and embraces her  Enter young  Melmoth  Mrs Mild  Welcome my Frederic to a mother's arms  Y Mel  Do you then give your daughter to my wishes Thus let me thank you for the precious gift  Kneeling and kissing Mrs Midmay's hand then rising and turning to Narcissa  But will Narcissa ratify the grant  Narc  In a tone of great concern  Indeed brother I know not what to say  Y Mel  Brother Narcissa  G Mel  Whence this mistake  to Mrs Mildmay  We have alas no son our Frederic died poor boy long since in India  Mrs Mild  Then have my hopes and fears alike been fruitless  Narc  Aside in a tone of joy and surprize  Again I feel my swelling heart replete  Y Mel  How what  Narc  And you are not my brother then at last  To Young Melmoth  Y Mel  Your brother Narcissa No dear as I might love a sister I would not be your brother for the world I see through the whole of your strange behaviour now  G Mel  To Mrs Mildmay  This young gentleman my dear is son to a distant relation lately dead to whose fortune he is heir and to whose last will I am executor  Narc  Hoity toity here's a tangled skain unravell'd  Y Mel  Aside  And general Melmoth is Narcissa's father  Enter lord  Courtly  introduc'd by servant  Serv  Lord Courtly madam  Exit Serv  Court  Ladies and gentlemen your servant Happily assembled I hopeturning to Young Melmoth I presume Mr Melmoth is by this time convinc'd of the impropriety of the angry billet he sent me this morning  Y Mel  The mistake we both lay under my lord at once justifies your behaviour and my resentment  Court  Fortunately for me however that mistake drew a promise from the amiable Narcissa which I flatter myself she is too generous to forget  Narc  It is true my lord I did promise to give you my hand if Mr Melmoth could not accept it and if you had come some few minutes ago I should have been terribly puzzl'd what to say to you But I can now keep my word without your reaping any advantage from my promise  Court  Madam Mrs Mildmay what have I to hope  Mrs Mild  Indeed my lord my present perplexity of joy and surprize makes me as incapable of expressing my obligations as the event puts it out of my power to requite them Narcissa is not Mr Melmoth's sister but instead of a brother she hath found a father and I a husband to whose guidance and protection we now are subject  G Mel  With your leave then madam Mr Melmoth shall be yet your son  Y Mel  Then have I found instead of lost a father  Bowing to general Melmoth who advances to embrace him  Mrs Mild  As to the preference I once gave your lordship  Court  It lays me under an obligation madam that in the present circumstances makes all apology needless  Narc  Generously said is not it Mr Melmoth Indeed my lord I wish you a better wife than I should have made you  Court  And I you madam all happiness with a husband that deserves you  T Mel  I shall endeavour to merit the compliment my lord  Enter alderman  Lombard  colonel  Camply  and  Sophia  Lomb  Your servant gentlemen and ladies You seem to be mighty well pleas'd here my daughter Sophy and the colonel have let me a little into something  G Mel  Oh Camply oh my friend behold my injur'd muchwrong'd wife and daughter  Camp  Is it possible  Lomb  How how the widow Mildmay general Melmoth's wife  G Mel  I see you're fill'd with wonder I could indeed relate a tale most wonderful but that excess of joy prevents its utterance  Lomb  Well then we'll wait general 'till you are a little more sorrowfulIn the mean time I must inform you that I have settled matters with your friend Camply  G Mel  I am glad of it Sir  Lomb  Ay ay my daughter and the borough go together There take her colonel and make her just as good a husband as she proves a wifefor my own part I shall defer my matrimonial project to another opportunity and I think it would not be amiss if his lordship follows my example  Court  Sir I hope I shall always have generosity of temper enough to rejoice in the happiness of others though not directly conducive to my own  G Mel  Such a disposition my lord cannot go long unrewarded Your lordship will do me honour in permitting me to cultivate a farther acquaintance with it But from the events of today we may see how ineffectual are all attempts to separate those whom love hath united and

Each quick pulsation for  Narcissa  beats  When she went offthey scarce could keep their seats  When  Lombard  talk'd of bribes how felt you that  To the pit  Some pulses in this house went pat pat pat  If this our night's prescription you have taken  Without wry faces or your heads much shaken  If you perceive some character some wit  With plot and humour  quantum sufficit  Mix'd up with salvolatile of satire  Let it  quotidie nocte repetatur    'Tis by  our  nostrums you are kept alive  Pursue the regimen of doctor  CLIVE
