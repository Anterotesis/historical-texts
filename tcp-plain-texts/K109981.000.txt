 A DIALOGUE Between A  Japonese  and a  Formosan  About some Points of The RELIGION of the TIME Price One Shilling  A DIALOGUE Between A  JAPONESE  AND A  FORMOSAN  About some Points of The RELIGION of the TIME  By  G Pmr  Quid rides  Fabula  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT at the  CrossKeys  next  Nando  's CoffeeHouse  Fleetstreet    THE PREFACE  THE chief Thing I purpose in the following Lines is to vindicate the  Japoneses  from that unjust Character this Part of the World is pleased to give them  viz  of being a People much given to Superstition What Reasons they had who first spoke so of them I cannot tell but this I am sure of that no People under the Sun are farther from it than they are as will more fully appear by the following Dialogue  'Tis true indeed the meaner sort of People are wholly led by Priestcraft and so are made to believe what the  Bonzes  please But as for the finer and better Sort they  would have you to know they scorn to captivate their Reasons to a few Writings of their Lawgivers construed and altered as they humbly conceive by the Priests whose Interest is to keep People in the greatest Ignorance and Subjection  I hope therefore that my setting of 'em in a fair Light will be taken by the World as a great Argument of my Candor and Generosity and having this  Colloquium  fresh still in my Memory which I know will go a greater Way by far in vindicating them than all I could say of my own Head I thought it would agree better with the Character I hope to gain by this to publish it just as I heard it because you have here the  Japanner  standing up for his Nation as well as himself and also a  Formosan  making his Objections with the  Japonese  's Answers to them so that the whole Matter being justly and impartially laid before you the Reader may the better judge as he shall see meet and that I take to be the only honest way of dealing with Readers  And I must confess that tho' I was Conscious of my Ignorance of the  English  Tongue yet I would by no means suffer any Body to methodize or correct it because I was afraid lest the Reader should hence find Occasion of suspecting the Sincerity of my Narrative Wherefore I here must beg of him to excuse all the Faults he shall find in the Language which he cannot reasonably expect a Stranger to be free from especially in such a refin'd one as the  English  at present is  I flatter my self with the Hopes  that it will be not a little entertaining the Questions therein handled bearing so near a Resemblance to the Disputes which make so much Noise here at present You'll see a  Japanner  who out of meer Friendship and kindness comes to free a Man from the Bondage of Priestcraft Prejudice and Ignorance and on the other side you'll see a  Formosan  like a willing Prisoner endeavouring to bring his Friend unto the same Condition as he is himself and both using all the Arguments they are Masters of towards effecting their Design  However that the Reader may not expect more of me than he is likely to find at the long run and so be obliged to throw away the Book in a Fury it will be very necessary to tell him that tho' I was so fortunate to be present at the opening  of the Conference yet I was unluckily call'd away upon some very earnest Business so that I could not stay for the Conclusion which was however so near at Hand that if he will take the same Liberty of guessing as I have done he'll be able to find out which way the Victory turned However 'twill still answer my Design which is to vindicate the  Japanner  when the Reader observes him all along arguing not like a Bigot but like a Man of a  free born Understanding  One Favour more I must beg of my Reader is that if he finds either of my  Disputants  to be out in his  Logick Philosophy  or  Divinity  he would not think the worse of me or think me guilty of the same Errors in my private Opinions as  v g  if one of them should happen to affirm Fire to be  bot contrary to the Modern Philosophers who affirm it to be cold For as I have resolved not to omit any of their Arguments or diminish the Strength of 'em so neither will I add any thing to it but such Blunders as they shall commit let them answer for themselves  A DIALOGUE Between A  Japonese  and a  Formosan  About some Points of The RELIGION of the TIME  Formosan  SIR you are heartily welcome to  Formosa  it is so long since we were blest with your Company that I almost despair'd ever of enjoying it again  Japonese  Sir I value yours so much that had I not been detain'd by Business I had not been so great a Stranger But to tell you the Truth I fell into the Acquaintance of some Gentlemen of great Parts who made me freely acquainted with some new Notions of theirs which  put me for some time into a brown Study till at last partly by their help and partly by my own Application I came to settle my Mind on the Matter  Formosan  Now you talk of Learned Men pray give me leave to ask you how your Friend does  Japonese  Meaning who  Formosan  Why the Priest that was here last time with you do not you remember  Japonese  Oh yes Why I think he's well but have seen him but once since I was here last For you must know we fell out mightily that time upon certain Points of Religion and I believe never will be reconciled at least I never will with him whatever he does with me  Formosan  How fallen out with a Priest I am sorry for that with all my Heart I thought you had more Respect for Men of his  Robe  and  Dignity  Japonese  A Fig for their Dignity and all that belongs to them they shall never catch me with such Chimeras again I'll promise you I have been their Fool and Slave long enough to my shame be it spoken but now I thank my Stars I am grown a little wiser and have shook off the Yoak and set my self free from their pretended Authority and to be plain with you this is the very Business These Gentlemen I was telling you of communicated me and which indeed did give me no little Trouble but I am at present so satisfied of the Priest's Confidence in claiming any Authority that I wonder how any Man can be so besotted as to acknowledge it Neither is this my Opinion only but also that of the greatest Wits of our Age tho' indeed I must own it never broke out so plainly as it has done within these Two Years yet you must needs think it had been a long while a brewing before  Formosan  This is a sudden alteration indeed and such as I little dreamed of but for Gd's sake Sir do you consider what you are a doing Do not you know that Priests derive their Authority from the Lawgivers and their Lawgivers from God So that you cannot deny that of the one without rebelling at the same time against the Two others  Japonese  Pho One may see plain enough You live in a Land of Darkness and Ignorance wholly influenced by Priestcraft were you but to live Months in  Yedo  or  Meako  you would see what a refined Air we breath and what a Learned Age we live in and I don't doubt but the changing of Climate would make you alter your Notions You cannot go into any Bookseller's Shop but you may see there some Books against the Authority of the Priests nay even of the Lawgivers themselves so that in a short time I hope we'll send them both a packing  which Work if once done will immortalize this Generation insomuch that I would not for the whole Empire be to be born in the next  Formosan  Nay if these be the Effects of your Climate I'll e'en tarry at home  Japonese  You may do what you please for that but I'll assure you what I say is positively true and the Authority of the Lawgivers as well as of the Priests is sinking down as fast as  Formosan  You fill me with wonders I protestWhat all the Writings of the Lawgivers which have been so long in the greatest Veneration and Credit opposed now with such Violence I thought it was so well grounded and so universally received so well confirm'd by Miracles that it was not in the Power of Man to overthrow it But pray what Arguments do they make use of to overthrow the Authority of such great Men as  Amida Xakha Cambadoxi  and the rest who have ever been reverenc'd as Gods from the Time of their leaving the World And what do the Priests say to all these Do they not oppose it with all their Strength and Might I should think 'tis their Interest as well as their Duty  Japonese  There have been a few who have endeavoured to do it but after such a way that it does more Good than Disservice to our Cause The generality of them hold their Tongues but however this is agreed on by all the judicious Persons that our Arguments are unanswerable I should have told you that there is one not a Priest who pretends to answer it not all at once but piece by piece  viz  to Day one to Morrow another but his Character is already so blackned  Formosan  I suppose by some of your Party on purpose to render him odious and so hinder People from reading his Papers But pray what are these Arguments of yours that you say all judicious Persons  own to be unanswerable how do you know but if they appear so to me I'll be one of your Proselytes  Japonese  My Arguments You mistake me Sir I do not give them you as my own neither would I have you to think that I am of their Mind for they go upon one Ground and I upon another Besides I don't carry the thing so far by half as they do I do assure you but however you shall hear what they say  First says one If the Writings of  Amida Xakha Cambadoxi  and other Lawgivers do give the least Authority to the Priests over the People then we may safely say they are of their own inventing or else these Lawgivers in the stead of being encouraged and admired while alive and deified and worshipped after their Deaths deserved rather to be punished and made to suffer the most ignominious Deaths that ever Slave was put to as being Usurpers of that Power lodg'd in every Man  Formosan  What Power do they mean  Japonese  Why Sir you must know they'll have it to be that neither Kings nor God himself has any Power over Men but what they have receiv'd from them Now what do you say to this  Formosan  So then God's Dominion and Power over us is as much denied as that of the Priests Is it not what I told you from the first that we could not refuse our Submission to the latter without turning Rebels to the former However I did not much wonder at People rebelling against the Priests But that Men should attack God's Authority so publickly is something amazing to me For I never thought that Men in their Senses would go to deny that as they had to their Cost so often felt I mean the Judgments he has sent to Men for their Sins The  Chineses  tell us of an universal Flood We can produce some such Punishments  in our History and as for yours it is brimful of 'em Now this is a certain Sign of God's Power over us Therefore either we must say that it was evilly gotten namely by Usurpation or else we must submit to it  Besides Reason as well as the Writings of the Lawgivers tells us indeed that God did give us Being but not that he did give us any Power over it and much less that we gave it him back again and if we have not this Power in us how can we pretend to give it to Kings or any Body else No Body can give what he has not himself  But farther granting that Reason goes very near to tell us that we have a Power over our selves yet if the Writings of our Prophets whom we have all the Reasons in the World to believe were sent from God do assure us of the contrary ought not our Reason to give place to them Besides that same Reason that tells me I have that Power tells me also that he who gave me Being gave me that Power over it and if so he can take it from us when ever he pleases So that which  way soever we look we'll find  God  's Power and Authority  to be over all his Works  One thing I wonder mightily at is that neither the Emperor nor the High Priests should hinder such Doctrines from taking Ground For if People are once perswaded that the Power of Kings and Priests is derived from the People nothing can hinder them from withdrawing it when ever they see Occasion so that neither of 'em can be safe on their Thrones  Then as to the Argument  viz  that if the Writings of  Amida c  does give any Power to the Priests then it is of their own inventing is to me not only a very bold but also a most senseless Assertion For how is it possible that such a Nation as yours should have all these Stories imposed upon you by a few Priests nay not only yours but also other neighbouring Nations such as  China Tartary  c in a Time when Learning seemed to flourish in every one of 'em erected and made other Countries erect Statues  to these pretended Gods suppose their Writings which as it might be made appear the  Chineses  themselves copied while the Authors of them were alive all these and several other Circumstances make it a Demonstration to me that it was not in the Power of the Priests to put such notorious Cheats upon so many Nations together  Neither can it be said that the Priests did alter these Writings for as I told you before so many other People having had Copies of 'em from the Beginning and kept 'em ever since and since they do all agree it is unreasonable to think that ever they did suffer the least Corruption  Besides do but consider the various Sects that are and have been in  Japan  ever since the Departure of the Lawgivers which Sects are in continual Disputes one with another about some Points of Religion These Disputes do not arise from any Difference of the Copies but from the Darkness of the Writings Now had any one of the Sects gone to make any Alteration  to serve their Turn the others would have immediately exposed them or done the same themselves neither of which can be proved Therefore it must be owned that these Writings are the same that  Amida Xakha  c wrote themselves  And since it does appear by all the Circumstances that accompanied their Lives as well during as before and after it that they were Men sent from the Great GOD to give Laws and to establish his Worship And since as I have proved GOD has a Power over his Creatures if these Prophets did claim any to themselves we ought to think that they had it from GOD and that whomsoever they did communicate it to might justly nay were bound to exercise it in their several Stations Which leads me to the rest of the Argument namely that if  Amida  c are the true Authors of these Writings they deserv'd to be put to Death for pretending to any Authority or to give it to others which is indeed a very severe and unjust Sentence For these that were sent  from GOD must surely know better to whom that Power belonged and consequently could lay the surer Foundations and yet we see that they were so far from pretending to any Authority in Matters of Civil Government that they renounced it as contrary to their Profession nay they enjoin'd all their Followers to obey those that were put in Authority over 'em and settled the King's Rights upon the best and surest Foundations that ever were  viz  on God's Authority and Commands his Rewards and Punishments Now therefore since all the Authority they claim is only concerning Spiritual Matters can any body be so unjust as to think them guilty of Death Or so incredulous as to refuse them their Obedience and shut their Eyes to the great Proofs they bring of their just Right to such Authority  Japonese  But Sir hear what another Learned Author says to this  There being such great Reasons for respecting and reverencing those Men who are  sent from GOD this might very well have pushed on some proud ambitious Fellows to pretend to such Mission But however continueth he if these Men do claim to themselves any Power over Men we may justly and lawfully suspect them  Formosan  What I have said to the last Argument will in some Measure answer this however I'll add this that as it is not these Men's bare Saying they are sent from God that ought to make us believe them so neither can such a silly Exception as that of their pretending to some Authority be a sufficient Pretence for our rejecting of 'em Every Man that pretends to be sent from GOD must do something to confirm his Mission Wherefore we see that all of 'em have wrought some kind of Miracles then is it left to us to judge whether these Miracles were real and true ones such as none but GOD or them whom his Hand was with could work or whether they were meer jugling Tricks Now that there have been some of the latter Stamp every  where must be owned because they have been discovered and some received their Punishment in this World But however this can never be an Argument against the former What Miracles  Amida Cambadoxy  c have wrought is sufficiently known to the World and by every impartial Man own'd to be above every Power but GOD's It will be also granted that God will never help Men in so particular a manner to deceive People and confirm an Imposture it will therefore follow that these Prophets challenging a Power in Ecclesiastical Matters can be no sufficent Bulwark against those strong Proofs given us by God himself in behalf of them How ridiculous then would it look in me because I believe without any or to speak more properly against all Reason that I am my own King and that no Body has Power over me but him whom I give it to how foolish I say would it be in me to go to deny such strong Evidence Because forsooth it contradicts that Notion of mine and demands that Submission of me which I thought I did owe no Body  but whom I pleased to give it freely  Now farther I would ask you whether you know of any Lawgiver that did not pretend to this Authority I don't believe you can produce one So then we must at that Rate throw away all manner of Revelation and go to the Play of  Blindmansbuff  or rather to the Childrens Play of  Hide and Seek  we must shut our Eyes to this Light we have and let our shallow Brains go and look for another Now what can such a shortleg'd Jade as Reason ridden and led by Interest Selflove and many other such Blind and Sinister Rulers find but a Religion suitable to every one of them and consequently as far from God as he is from them You see therefore that while we endeavour to set Reason free as we think we rather make her the more a Slave and in the stead of one Master  viz  GOD we find her Forty such as Pride Ambition Interest Selflove and Four and Thirty more of the like nature  To conclude therefore since we find by woeful Experience how shortsighted and weak our Reason is and how unable of it self of finding the right Worship of God and secondly that God in Compassion to this our Infirmity did inspire some Men to come and teach it and has confirm'd their Doctrine with so many Signs and Wonders such as do not leave us the least Occasion to doubt of it's coming from him it will follow that these inspired Men as well as their Successors not only might justly but also were and are in Duty bound to exercise this Authority which God gave 'em in their several Stations and all the rest are of Consequence obliged to obey  Japonese  But now Sir my last quoted Author will tell you that the Doorkeeper of the Temple has as much Right to pray preach and offer sacrifices to God as the best Priest of 'em all Therefore they should in the stead of boasting of their Authority own themselves no better than Servants  hired and payed by the People For doing of these things that belong to God's Worship and so any body that will may as well be a Priest in his own Family and perform all the Divine Rites there as well as the Priest at Church  Formosan  If the foregoing Arguments had been as you said  all ingenious Persons own  unanswerable then this would have followed of Course But as we have stated this Power  viz  upon the incontestable Power of the Lawgiver which was immediately and undoubtedly derived from God their Author had as good tell me that I have as much Right to go and sit in the Emperor's PrivyCouncil or to lead his Army as those whom he has chosen to it However not to take too much upon me in pretending to know Religion better than your self You may satisfie your self this way if by the Writings of the  Lawgivers  and other Authentick Histories it do not appear that  Amida Xakha  c chose themselves Successors from among  their DIsciples whom and whom alone they communicated this Power to But on the contrary if it does appear that they gave Power to every one and that they accordingly made use of it then your Hypothesis stands firm enough then the Doorkeeper's Cookmaid can claim as much Right as the Priest but if I mistake not both the Prophet's Writings and the History of those Times tell us quite different things In the First we read that they chose some Men whom in a particular manner they invested with that Power of Preaching and performing the Ceremonies of Divine Worship and that these Chosen Men did do the same to others as the Doctrine did propagate In the Second we have no mention of any particular Congregation which was not with a Priest not chosen as  a Servant  but ordained by other Priests in a higher Degree which has continued from that time till this  Now if you can from what has been said find out your Author to be in the right you had as good be of his Mind still but if the contrary  then I would advise you to put up that Pride of yours and return to your primitive State and consider that these Priests are as Ambassadors from God and consequently ought to keep up their Dignity and Authority without bating one jot of it considering whom they represent And if some Envoys have been severely punished by their Sovereigns for doing of Things unworthy the Persons they represented much more ought these Vicegerents of God to fear lest by their too much facility they make the People despise them Respect we cannot shew 'em too much but we can and I am afraid generally do shew 'em too little However this may always be said for us that 'tis no Affront either to our Reason or our Manhood to reverence and obey the Priests under the notion of Legates of the Almighty because then all our Submission is directly paid to him whose Power and Authority over us none but Fools and Madmen can call in question But Sir however I am glad to hear of what you told me  viz  that these were none of your Arguments and I wish  they may not be your Principles neither But however tho' you tell me you don't carry the Thing so far as these Authors yet you seem to have but a mean Opinion of the Priests or rather do intirely rebel against their Authority Wherefore I should be glad to hear your Complaints against 'em for I have more reason to care for you than for those Gentlemen who have drawn you away  Japonese  To be plain with you Sir what these Gentlemen and I were alledging against the Priests was their imposing upon Mens Reasons things quite contrary to it under the notions of Mysteries which they must be either Fools for believing or Kns for making others believe And this was the Thing that I told my  quondam  Friend that time we fell out whereupon he was so exasperated at what I said to him that he went away and never came to me again and I to be sure was not such a Fool to go after him Now therefore the Grounds I go upon are these the Priests cannot stretch their  Authority beyond the set Bounds of it without turning Usurpers Tyrants Deceivers  c  Now when they are once liable to all these Denominations they do no more answer the Intention of him that ordained 'em and therefore we may safely deny them that Submission which they might have challenged had they kept within their Compass Now that they do deserve the aforesaid Appellations does sufficiently appear by the Absurdities they crowd in their  Creeds  and oblige every one under pain of Damnation most firmly to believe Therefore I hope you won't condemn me for taking my leave of them  Formosan  Before we call 'em all these odious Names we ought to consider Things First whether the Writings on which our Faith is grounded be true or not If they be true whether they oblige us to believe these Mysteries under pain of Damnation For if they do then the Priests affirm no more than the Scriptures do Now as for the Truth of these Writings I believe we have  sufficiently settled neither do you seem to deny that Point And as for their affirming such Doctrines any body may be satisfied that reads them  Japonese  What then if these Writings do tell me Contradictions and Things that shock my Reason I must believe them must I  Formosan  But Sir do but see how your great Zeal against Contradictions leads you into a notorious one You own these Writings to be of Authority and at the same time say If they teach meContradictions Which is as plain a one as can be  Japonese  Well then to speak plainer my Opinion is that God cannot oblige us to believe Things contrary to Reason If therefore there is any thing of that nature in these Writings I'll very fairly reject it  Formosan  You must be very sure however that these Things proposed do imply that Contradiction before you reject them for there is no doubt but if you find fault with one part of the Writings you do quite overthrow the Credit and Authority of the rest  Japonese  I beg your Pardon for that I may reject one part of them and yet believe the other as fast as you do your whole Creed For I don't think the whole Mass of Writings to be of that same Authority Some there be that are undoubtedly and unquestionably true and of Divine Inspiration others that may be reckoned Apocriphas tho' the Priests would make them pass for Canonical and there be others which are apparently false which might perhaps have been very true and Authentick when first written but afterwards either by the Carelesness of the Transcribers or the Malice of the Keepers have been so corrupted that at present we may lawfully reject them as false  Formosan  As to the first I can't say much there may be Mistakes committed by the Transcribers yet I should think there is yet enough left of the Writings in which all Copies do agree to prove these Doctrines but as for the latter  viz  of their being corrupted by the Keepers so as to render them liable to Suspicion I thought I had proved unfeasible But yet grant all this what  Kriterion  will you make use of to know which is which That seems to me a very difficult matter and if you can furnish me with any Rules for the distinguishing the one from the other  eris mihi magnus Apollo  Japonese  Well then to shew you I am not unprovided with that neither I'll give you Three Rules which indeed are not the Product of my Brain for I had 'em from one of our Party who wrote sometime ago a Book concerning  Inspiration  The whole would be worth your Reading and if you did I don't believe you would go away with your Bigotry but to the Rules  The First is that  Amida  being the greatest Lawgiver the greatest Demigod and all the rest being only Witnesses as 'twere to him we are obliged to believe no more than  Amida  's own Writings and that with this  Second Rule that we ought to believe no more even of  Amida  but what we find all the Copies to agree in and whatever we find in one of the Copies which is not or is otherwise in another that we may safely reject  The Third Rule is that when we have summon'd up all that the Copies do agree in I mean of  Amida  's only we are bound to believe no more of that neither than we find agreeable to our Reason Now these be the Three Rules  Formosan  And very good ones too I protest But Sir do you not perceive what a  Credulous  Man you are grown when even you intend to be the Reverse you will not believe what God has revealed  because it seems to you against your Reason But you can take these Rules nay I am confident a great part of your Gentlemen as well as your self can believe Things upon the Authority of another Man Now what would you think if a Man should overthrow these your Rules you depend so much on  Japonese  I should think he has at once undone what another has been a long while a hamering but that I think impossible  Formosan  However 'tis worth aiming at and to begin your Author says that  Amida  being the greatest God and the rest only Witnesses to him you'll believe the former but not the latter that's a Contradiction For First before you can believe in  Amida  you must be sure that those that witnessed of him are true Prophets and do not lie And then how can you unbelieve that again  Secondly these Witnesses did prove the Truth of their Testimony by Signs  and Miracles as well as  Amida  and consequently their Authority must be equal as being both confirmed by God for a Thing let it be ever so true can amount to no more than a Truth I'll allow you therefore that  Amida  is a greater Hero in Dignity but not in Credit than the rest  Thirdly You know very well that  Amida  refers the Authority of his Mission to the Prophets that were before him and bore witness of him so that if any of the Two may be questioned it should be the former Besides we see that  Amida  speaks with all the Respect in the World of these Lawgivers commends them and in short bears as much witness of them as they did of him Now that a Man may be mistaken in another Man may be well said but that a Prophet inspired by God should give a good Character to an Impostor is absurd therefore the Authority of both depending so much upon one another we cannot pull out one of the Pillars without bringing the whole House upon our Heads  As to your Second Rule  viz  that you'll have all the Copies agree in one Article before you believe it I'll tell you what the Consequence of it will be you must first take the Trouble to romage all the extant Copies compare them very exactly which by the way is no easy task before you can settle your Religion which when done may be in a little time altogether destroyed For it is but bribing some Booksellers or Transcribers to make a new Copy contradicting one of your settled Articles then off must it go out of the Book till at last by throwing out one Article after another you proceed Religionless  And your Third Rule  viz  of believing nothing but what is agreeable to your Reason is as comical a one as ever was invented For first if it is a true one and may be depended on what need is there for the Two foregoing ones If you'll believe nothing but what appears to you reasonable you need not trouble your self who it is that writ these Things nor whether  the Copies do agree in For let the Author be who he will let the Copies contradict one another ever so much what is agreeable to Reason will be so still for all that and consequently will challenge our Belief  dly this is asmuch as if you should say I'll believe no more of these Lawgivers than I will of any other Man nay less For when to my knowledge you have been told by several Men that in very cold Countries they had seen the Water grow so hard that a Cart went over it You have believ'd it upon the Honesty of these Relators tho' I don't know how you'll make this and Reason agree  If so what need have you to talk so much of Inspiration Divine Authority  c  since it appears by this Rule that  Amida Xakha  and whosoever do pretend to any may e'en go whistle with it You'll assoon if not rather believe any honest Men as you will them with all their Divine Inspiration You had as good therefore coin your  Three Rules into this one  viz That we are not obliged to make a Distinction between a Man sent from God and an honest Learned Man that speaks of his own Head but believe as much of either as our Reason will admit  What Necessity was there then for God's working so many and great Miracles to confirm the Doctrine he revealed unto us if after all it is left to every body to serve it as People do a Market chuse what best pleases their Palate and leave the rest for less nice Customers we might all have done that without the help of one single Miracle  Farther if God designed to reveal nothing to us but what was agreeable to our Reason then that very Revelation was needless for our Reason could have found it out of it self But however let that pass as a Supposition because it is not much to the present purpose whether it be true or no this will however follow that without the Help of any Supernatural Conviction we might have given our  Assent to such reasonable Propositions  My Opinion therefore is that these Lawgivers were to declare to us something above Reason for which the Power of working Miracles was given them that they might challenge our Belief to a Thing which Reason doth not comprehend which when declar'd unto us we must not expect to understand better than before they will be above our Reach still as the Men who told you of the Water growing hard in cold Countries they gained indeed your Assent as to the matter of Fact but as to the manner how they left you as ignorant as they found you  Besides you must own that▪ the Name of  Mystery  is used in the Writings of the Lawgivers under what Notion must we understand it Can we say that what they call great and high Mysteries are only Things agreeable to Reason but only more Sublime than the common Truths Still does not this answer the Notion of Mystery Let us therefore  conclude that when the Priests do teach us any thing that is above our Reason under the Notion of Mysteries they do no more than the Lawgivers themselves have done And if these Doctrines were Mysteries to them that had besides Divine Inspiration a great many other Advantages we want well may they be so unto us and well may we be thought very presumptions to reject them because our shallow Reason can't reach them  Let me therefore make bold to give you the following Advice  First always to distinguish those Things that are above Reason from those that are against it We call that Thing against Reason that contradicts our former Ideas framed on a due Consideration or on selfevident Principles as for Instance to say that Fire is cold is against Reason because we have upon good Grounds conceived the Idea of Fire as of a hot Thing But when we come to speak of God and of his Nature there is nothing can properly be said to contradict our Idea  because we never did frame one that we could say was to be depended upon  Now if we are to set so great Value upon those Ideas our Reason has framed how come Men all generally to agree in the Worship of God which is certainly against those Ideas we had or ought to have framed of him The Worship of God consists in praising of him in praying to him for what we stand in need of and in giving Thanks for what we have received The Idea we have of a God is of a Being infinitely Good Merciful Just  c  We reckon up all the Excellencies that we find in Men and attribute them to God in an infinite manner When then we praise God and tell of his Attributes may not that shock his Modesty as praising a Man before his Face To pray to him for any Blessings contradicts the Ideas we had of his Goodness and Liberality He is no generous Person that knows another to be in Necessity and will not relieve him till he asks for it And so to give Thanks to a generous Spirit for any Favour is a kind of an Affront to them like  praising of 'em and much more to God if we follow our Ideas before fram'd I wonder therefore that it never came into your Heads to abolish the Worship of God as contrary to Reason and then you'll have a very lazy Religion and a good Time on't  Nay what do you think to believe that God is a Spirit is not that quite contradicting all the Ideas we had framed And that same may also be said of believing God to be Infinite Eternal  c  For our Understanding is too little to receive any Ideas but what are limited to Time Place  c  and Infinity Eternity being infinitely too large to squeeze into such narrow Compass are forced to lie without Doors Farther ask that Reason of yours that will believe nothing that contradicts it how she comes to believe God's  Essence  and his Attributes to be the same without Composition for it is certain it will always apprehend his Wisdom and Power as distinct his  Justice  and  Mercy  as opposite How can we believe God to be intire in all Places and yet not circumscribed to  any that he penetrates all Substance and is mixed with none that he understands without the Reception of any  Idea  that he loves without Passion is angry without Disturbance repents without Change and so many other Perfections that are essential to his Godhead ask your Reason I say whether it does fully understand them and it will answer negatively why then do you believe 'em It is evident therefore that it was left even to Reason to clip Religion till it thought it enough it would not cease till it had made it imperceptible to the nicest Eye  Sccondly before we can positively affirm that a Proposition implies a Contradiction we must be sure that the contradictory Idea we had fram'd before is well grounded For Instance before we can say that 'tis a Contradiction to assirm that the Sun is cold or dark we must be sure that he is both hot and light But when we come to speak of Things above Reason's reach we cannot say that the Doctrine of  Amida  concerning God  contradicts our Reason because we can never be so confident of our former Notion of his Being but we may reject them upon better Authority without offering any Affront to our Reason Therefore tho' we might very well think our Notions extraordinary good and firm at first  i e  before the Revelation yet when God's Authority comes and tells us the contrary I think  Reason  her self will think it most  reasonable  to give place  Thirdly how do you know but one time or other if not here at least in the next World our Understandings will be opened so that tho' at present they cannot so much as see the possibility of these  Arcana  yet then they shall see all these plainly even so far as to be ashamed of our Dulness while on this side the Grave and yet this is the Promise of one of the Disciples of  Amida  What a heavy Rout would not a raw untaught Country Plowman make if you should go to perswade him that the World turneth round as  Meat round the Spit How many Objections would he make which tho' to you would appear very silly and impertinent yet to him would seem very wise and substantial ones Now how do you know but whilst you are crying out  Absurdity Absurdity  those blessed Men who for ought we know are already admitted to the Sight of all these Things we see here but thro' a Glass darkly would laugh or at least which would be more agreeable to their State pity us for our Blindness but much more for our Incredulity if they were to behold our wise Proceedings here  How many Things are there which have appeared contrary to Reason impossible  c  which either by a more mature Consideration or by experience have been made as clear as the Sun And if we may be allow'd to compare mean little Things to great ones I'll tell you a Story not foreign to our purpose A Centleman in  Europe  having a mind to make himself merry with some of his FellowMathematicians came one Day to 'em  with a chearful Countenance and told them He had found the way to make an Egg stand on end on a Table without any other Support at all upon which they all stood amaz'd and after having debated the Matter seriously they voted it  Nemine Contradicente  impossible and thought he was in jest wherefore to shew he was in earnest took the Egg and broke one end flat and so set it to stand upon the Table  Japonese  Ha ha ha ha  Formosan  When they saw the Thing done the next Word one spoke was I could have done it Bless me cries another that I should not have thought on't You see by this a Thing which appeared impossible to a whole Company of truly learned Men which when shewn nothing seems easier I need not make any Application  A certain Gentleman of your Party wrote a Book in vindication of your  Opinion and concludes with these Words That he refers his farther Conviction till the next World I would not advise you to do the same it will not be time then And I had as good fancy first that a Man may be saved without Holiness and so wallow in Sin all his Lifetime and refer his farther Conviction and if need be his Conversion till the Day of Judgment I think their Case would not be much unlike unless it be that the first might have more Right to plead Ignothan the latter You see I have been obliged to stand up for your Religion as much as if it had my own and that because we in our Religion have our Mysteries as well as you in yours and are bound to obey respect and reveverence our Priests as well as you yours But what was you going to say for I have done  Japonese  But now Sir  Here at last we are come to that fatal Minute in which I was unfortunately call'd away without staying  to see the Conclusion and therefore I must here leave off entreating the kind Reader not to censure me for making the  Japanner  begin a Speech and not end it as if I should go by the common Proverb which says that ParishClerks Women and Fools will always speak the last Word which was very far from my Thoughts but intending from the beginning to be as just in this Relation as I could I thought it would be took as an Argument of my great Sincerity not to omit even Three such insignificant Words as  But now Sir  FINIS  BOOKS printed for Bernard
