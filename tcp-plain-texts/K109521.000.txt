Aqua Tinta from Views taken on the Road to and at that Place  LONDON  PRINTED WITH THE TYPES OF STEPHENSON's BRITISH LETTERFOUNDRY FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCXC  INTRODUCTION  THE following descriptive Account of an Excursion to  Brighthelmstone  is intended to give those who have not visited that delightfully situated Town and its Environs an Idea of the Pleasures with which a lively and feeling Mind will be impressed on viewing those Scenes which the Authors have endeavoured to illustrate  Brighthelmstone  formerly an insignificant Village is now become highly interesting on several AccountsThe purity of the Air the evervarying Prospect of the Sea the excellent Accommodations for Strangers and the acknowledged Superiority of the Bathing Machinesthese and many other Considerations will always have a powerful Influence on Persons of true Tastebut when we also consider that a Personage as remarkable for Generosity and Affability and as distinguished for discerning and rewarding Merit as he is exalted by his Birth has fixed upon this chearful and salu∣brious Spot for his Summer Residence we are not surprised at seeing a Multitude of Persons of both Sexes the Pride and Admiration of  Britain  following the Royal Visitor to the  English Baiae  Of the Roads which lead to  Bright∣helmstone  that immediately from  London  being most frequented the Authors have endeavoured to familiarize it to the Traveller by the Pen and Pencil  The various Scenes which are introduced are slightly represented and intended merely to impress the Mind with the general Effects of NatureIt is in short a Conversation Narrative illustrated occasionally with  SKETCHES  of those Scenes and Incidents which seemed most worthy of Notice  AN  EXCURSION TO BRIGHTHELMSTONE  CROSSING the  Thames  over  WestminsterBridge  we entered the County of  Surry  of which we think it necessary to prefix a general but concise Description  SURRY is terminated on the West by  Hampshire  on the South by  Sussex  on the East by  Kent  and on the North by the River  Thames  It is Miles in Length from  Rotherhithe  in the East to  Trensham  in the West and Miles in breadth from the  Thames  in the North to  Awfold  in the South and Miles in Circumference It contains Square Miles or about Acres near Houses Hundreds Parishes Market Towns    Villages and Hamlets and about Inhabitants  In this County are several Royal Palaces and a great Number of Noblemen and Gentlemen's VillasThe Air and the Soil in the interior Parts are very different from what they are at the ExtremitiesOn the Borders the Air is Mild and healthy and the Soil fertile in Corn and Hay with a Proportion of Woodlandespecially in the  South about  Holmsdale  and in the North near the  Thames  But in the interior Parts the Air is bleak and the Soil in general sandy and sterileThe Principal Rivers which abound with Fish are exclusive of the  Thames  the Mole the Wey and the Wandle The Mole which rises in the South East of the County obtained its Name from its Sinking in the Earth at the Foot of  BoxHill  and after having run under Ground for two Miles emerging again at  Leatherhead  from whence it continues its Course Northwards and falls into the  Thames  at a Village called  Moulsey  The Wey enters this County from  Hampshire  near  Farnham  and runs Eastward to  Godalming  there turning to the North it becomes navigable to  Weybridge  where it falls into the  Thames  The Wandle rises near  Carshalton  and runs with a clear though small Stream famous for Trout by  MertonAbbey  to  Wandsworth  where it falls into the  Thames  The first Place that deserves Notice after we had passed  WestminsterBridge  was KENNINGTON a Village near  Lambeth  and one of the Eight Precincts of that ParishOn the Common of the same Name a temporary Gibbet is frequently erected for the Execution of Criminals in the County of  Surry  About Miles farther and Miles and a half from  London  is CLAPHAM a very agreeable VillageOn the adjacent Common are many neat and pleasantly situated Houses chiefly inhabited by Citizens who enjoy a pure Country air at a convenient Distance from the Center of Business  London  Here a handsome Church was built in by the Contribution of the Parishioners a Schoolhouse also was formerly built for the Education of poor Children  Passing through BALLAM situated about one Mile beyond  Clapham  and proceeding rather more than a Mile beyond we arrived at UPPERTOOTING a delightful VillageThere is however besides its situation nothing remarkable in it except an Almshouse built in by the Mother of Sir  John Bateman  Lord Mayor of  London  for the Reception of Six poor Women to be nominated by the Heir of the Family  SUTTON  About a Mile and a half South East is LOWER TOOTING not worthy of particular Notice  Not far from  UpperTooting  at a Village called MARTIN or MERTON  Kenulph  King of the  West Saxons  was murdered in the House of a Lady whom he tenderly lovedIt is also celebrated for a stately Abbey erected here by  Henry  the First for the Reception of Canons of the Order of St  Augustin  Part of the Walls remain but very insufficient to convey an Idea of its ancient Magnificence  Pursuing our Journeyabout Miles beyond  LowerTooting  we arrived at MITCHAM a well inhabited Village and extremely well situatedThe following Anecdote curious in its Circumstances we hope will not be misplaced One  H Smith  who by the Occupation of a Silversmith in  London  had acquired a considerable Fortune formed the strange Resolution of spending the Remainder of his Days as a Common Beggar He confined his Limits to the County of  Surry  where he was known by the Appellation of  "Dog Smith"  but having given Offence to an Inhabitant of this Town he was by a Justice of the Peace ordered to be publickly whipp'd This he resented so much that he left at his Death Fifty Pounds a Year or One Thousand Pounds in Money to every MarketTown in the County  Mitcham  excepted  Here is a Fair on the th of  August  for Cattle Toys c  SUTTON Miles from  London  is the first Post StageThe  Cock  kept by  Fuller  is an excellent Inn where the Traveller may be supplied with good Chaises and able HorsesThis Village is very pleasantly situated and the Air is no pure and healthy that with the additional Inducement of eating the celebrated  BansteadDown  Mutton many of the Citizens of  London  resort here on Sundays  Proceeding over  WaltonHeath  about Miles beyond  Sutton  we came to  ReigateHill  a remarkably bold Ele∣vation from whence is a delightful Prospect of the South Downs in  Sussex  But near the Road which is scoop'd out of the Hill the Declivity is so steep and abrupt that the Spectator cannot help being struck with Terror though softened by AdmirationThe Sublime and the Beautiful are here perfectly united Imagination is fully exercised and the Mind delighted  REIGATE the second Post Stage is Miles from  London  It is situated in the Vale of  Holmsdale  and beautifully surrounded with Hills is an Ancient Borough by Prescription and is governed by a Bailiff chosen annually at the Manor CourtHere is a handsome Church a Charity School and a Market House This last was formerly a Chapel dedicated to Thomas à BecketThere are also some inconsiderable Remains of a very ancient Castle in one of the Apartments of which the Barons who were in Arms against King  John  are said to have held their private Meetings  At the  WhiteHart  the Traveller is certain of meeting with every Accommodation he can wish good Posthorses an excellent Larder genuine Wines c which have rendered Mrs  Sully  worthy the Encouragement she meets withHis ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES in his Excursions to  Brighthelmstone  frequently dines here  A Fair is held at  Reigate  on  Whitmonday  and another on the th of  September  In the Reign of King  Henry  the Third  William Warren  Earl of  Surry  founded a Priory of Black Canons at the bottom of a Hill adjoining to  Reigate  which is now a DwellingHouse  Near  Reigate  are two Boroughs GATTON and BLECHINGLEYeach of which sends two Members to Parliament  GATTON is a Borough by Prescription near which Place some Roman Coins have been found  BLECHINGLEY has nothing particularly remarkable  We therefore proceeded on our Journey 'till we arrived on the Borders of SUSSEX of which County it may not be improper before we enter it to give a short Description  The Name of SUSSEX is derived from a Word which signified the County of the  South Saxons  It is terminated on the North by  Surry  on the East and North East by  Kent  on the South by the  British Channel  and on the West by  Hampshire  Its length is Miles its breadth and its Circumference containing square Miles divided into Rapes or Laths to each of which there formerly belonged a Castle a River and a Forest It is besides subdivided into Hundreds which include Parishes City MarketTowns Villages and Hamlets and has Houses  The Air of this County is in general wholesome though to Strangers it is sometimes productive of Agues In the North Parts it is rather foggy but healthy and upon the Downs it is remarkably pure The hilly Parts are naturally less fertile than the others but the Vales and especially the  Weald  are highly productiveThe  South Downs  from whence is a beautiful prospect are generally covered with Sheep remarkable for the fineness of their Wool a great Quantity of which is too often clandestinely smuggled into  France  notwithstanding the Atten∣tion of the Legislature to this great Object to the great Injury of the  British  Woollen Manufactures The Middle  Part of the County is beautifully interspersed with Meadows Pasture Grounds Woods and Corn Fields the last of which produce great Abundance of Wheat and Barley The North Part abounds in Woods which furnish the DockYards with large Quantities of valuable Timber and supply the IronWorks in the Eastern Part of the County with CharcoalThe principal Rivers are the  Arun  the  Adur  the  Ouse  and the  Rother  The smaller Rivers are the  Lavant  the  Cuchmeer  the  Ashburn  and the  Astem  SUSSEX is in the Province of  Canterbury  and in the Diocese of  Chichester  CRAWLEY Miles from  London  is the first Town in SUSSEX which we visited but not meeting any thing here particularly worthy of Notice continued our Route 'till we arrived at CUCKFIELD Miles distant from  London  Here a Fair is held in  September  resorted to by a great Number of pretty rustic Females and by a multitude of happy Swains  From  Cuckfield  to  Brighthelmstone  about Miles distant the Country is chearful and the Prospects various and extensive  PRESTON Mile from  Brighthelmstone  is a beautiful Spot adorned with a great Number of venerable Elms  PrestonHouse  is said to have been the Residence of  Anne of Cleves  Consort to  Henry  the Eighth from hence she retired to a Convent at  Falmer  about Miles distant where she died and was buried  From hence the bending Sky is seen at an immeasurable Distance meeting the Surface of the Ocean and forming the grand Curve of the sensible Horizon  From the great Number of human Bones which have been dug up in the Neighbourhood of  Brighthelmstone  we may naturally suppose it to have been the Scene of some great Battle and as the Coast of  Sussex  was certainly the Place where the  Belgians  often landed and at last effected a Settlement there is no doubt but the  Ancient Britons  had frequent Disputes with them and that many Battles were fought one of which probably might have been near this Town  In the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  when the Kingdom was threatened with an Invasion from  Spain  this was thought a Place of Importance and there are yet Remains of a Wall near the Sea which seems to have been erected about that Time  When  Charles  the Second escaped from the Battle of  Worcester  he wandered through different Parts of the Kingdom seeking an opportunity to escape to  France  and coming to this Place attended by Lord  Wilmot  and a few other faithful Friends so disguised that without being known by any of the Inhabitants he was by means of a fishing Boat safely landed in  France  Julius Caesar  is said to have landed here in one of his Expeditions against  Britain  A great number of  Druidical  Monuments and Altars have been discovered in this Neighbourhood  BRIGHTHELMSTONE one of the most Southern Towns in the County of  Sussex  is situated in a Bay terminated by  BeachyHead  on the East and by  WorthingPoint  on the West The  Stein  at  Brighthelmstone  is most beau∣tifully situated Three Sides of it are formed by very neat and convenient LodgingHouses cThe fourth is open to the Sea The rising Downs behind are a Shelter and Ornament The white Cliffs are seen trending to the East as far as  Seaforth  and on the West the Eye ranges over the Liquid Expanse and reaches  PortsdownHill Spithead  the Eastern Part of the  Isle of Wight  c  The Marine Pavilion of HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES on the West Side of the  Stein  is a striking Object and is admirably calculated for the Summer Residence of the Royal Personage for whom it was built and whose Munificence and Affability endear him to all who are not biassed by Party blinded by Prejudice or hostile to dignified Merit This Pavilion correctly designed and elegantly executed was begun and compleated in five MonthsThe Furniture is adapted with great Taste to the Stile of the Building The grand Saloon is beautifully decorated with Paintings by  Rebecca  executed in his best Manner The  toul ensemble  of the Building is in short perfect Harmony The Whole was executed by Mr  Holland  under the immediate Inspection and Direction of Mr  Weltjie  whose Attachment to his Royal Master was faithful and disinterested The Stables belonging to his Royal Highness are built in a Stile of convenient Simplicity correspondent with that of the other Buildings  The Bathing Machines are under the Care of the attentive  Smoaker  The number of beautiful Women who every Morning court the Embraces of the Watery God far exceeds that of any other Bathing Place in the Kingdom  The Market is plentifully stocked with all Kinds of excellent Provisions and culinary Vegetables at a very reasonable Price  The  Theatre  is situated in  NorthStreet  The Company of Actors is in general very respectable most of the favourite dramatic Pieces selected from the  London  Theatres are performed in the Course of the Season with great Propriety  There are two excellent Libraries on the  Stein  kept by Messrs  Crauford  and  Dulot  also a good PrintShop by Mrs  Lay  which with Miss  Currie's  Shop in  NorthStreet  are the Places of polite Resort From the various and excellent Assortments of useful and ornamental Commodities at the above Places Selections are frequently made for a Raffle  A good Band of Music plays on the  Stein  for some Time twice a DayThe lovely Throng of Females in all the Elegance of a light Summer's Dress woven in Fancy's Loom who here suffer the Sea Breezes to riot on their Charms is exceedingly numerous  In the Town is a Hot and a Cold BathOne Mile out of Town is an excellent Chalybeate Spring possessing all the Properties of the celebrated  Tunbridge  Waters  Of LodgingHouses those erected on the  Stein  being most beautifully situated are consequently most expensive but there are others suitable to Persons of all Ranks and Fortunes  At the RoomsWhist and other Clubs meet Those who prefer Dice may also enjoy their favourite Amusement  The Wheatears so called from a corrupted Translation of the  French Cul blanc  are taken in great Numbers on the Downs near  Brighthelmstone  during the Summer Months  The Race Ground is exceedingly well adapted to the Purpose for which it was intended and is one of the most beautifully situated Spots in the World The Prospect is wonderfully extensive and magnificent  The Races are in  July  There are always Three Fifties besides several Sweepstakes Matches c A handsome and convenient Stand sufficiently capacious to receive a great Number of Spectators is erected on the Course  At a small Distance from the Race Ground there was formerly a  Roman  Station now called WHITEHAWKE some Vestages of which of a circular Form are still visible  Four Miles East of  Brighthelmstone  is a delightful Village called ROTTINGDEANE it's Situation on a Cliff is remarkably bold and striking and at a convenient Distance to receive the Overflow of Strangers from  Brighthelm∣stone  who may here be accommodated with Lodgings and Bathing MachinesThe Road which leads to this Village over the Downs is extremely pleasant and the Prospect beautiful  The  Devil's Dyke  formerly a  Roman  Encampment about Miles Northwest of  Brighthelmstone  is a won∣derful SituationThe Prospect from hence is so very extensive that the Eye takes in successively a circumference of Milescomprehending a great Number of Spires Towns and Villages  At HOOVEbetween  Brighthelmstone  and  New Shoreham  are the remains of a Church which seems to have been originally a Structure of great Beauty and Grandeur  New SHOREHAMabout Miles from  Brighthelmstone  Westward is noted for Shipbuilding in which Art the Inhabitants are allowed to excell  NEWHAVENabout Miles East of  Brighthelmstone  is situated at the Mouth of the River  Ouse  was formerly famous for its safe and commodious Harbour which is now unfortunately choaked up with Mud and Sand but we may expect that from the laudable Exertions of the Inhabitants of the Town it will in Time recover its former Celebrity  FINIS
