 CAESAR  's CAMP OR St  GEORGE  's HILL A POEM  By the Reverend Mr  DUCK RECTOR  of  Byfleet  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  And sold by M COOPER in  PaternosterRow    CAESAR's CAMP OR St GEORGE'S HILL A POEM  IF lofty hills the tuneful Muse delight  Ye tuneful Muses hither take your flight  Forsake Parnassus and your virgin spring  And soar where Caesar's eagles spread their wing  When mad Ambition fir'd the warrior's brain  To seek new conquests o'er the British main  What tho' few laurels on the mountains grow  A thousand fruitful landscapes smile below  Where Phoebus' trees perpetual honours wear  And cedars flourish verdant all the year  Rich pasture  here  adorns the flow'ry mead  There golden Ceres waves her bending head  A mingled scene of profit and delight  Which chears the peasant charms the poet's sight  His sight which o'er the various prospect roves  Now pleas'd with gardens and now pleas'd with groves  Now wanders over Guilford's lovely plain  Where the fleet courser stretches every vein  He paws he pants impatient for the chace  Then sweeps along the scarcelybending grass  Not swifter swallows skim along the flood  To seize the wanton fly their destin'd food  Than o'er the plain the nimble coursers bound  And champ the shining bit and toss their foam around  Let lofty Pindar sing the Grecian steed  Britannia glories in as choice a breed  As gallant heroes too adorn her coast  As fam'd Olympia's plain could ever boast  Thy groves O Weston next the Muse invite  Thy beechen groves must ev'ry Muse delight  Here may she tune her lyre beneath the shade  Or meditate along thy open glade  Where once she  The house now Mr Weston's was formerly Sir Walter Raleigh's  Raleigh's noble soul inspir'd  When he from business war or courts retir'd  Raleigh whose actions merit deathless fame  The nation's glory and the monarch's shame  Ah what avail wit wisdom learning arts  Superior courage and sublimer parts  The wit the scholar statesman hero sage  Falls a sad victim to Iberian rage  Yet still he's pleas'd to see his beauteous grove  If aught below can please the bless'd above  Reward the gen'rous virtue of a son  Who for a father's good despis'd his own  Here when the golden autumn's ripen'd stores  Have plenteously enrich'd the farmer's floors  Soon as Aurora ushers in the day  While pearly dews embellish every spray  The wellbreath'd beagles snuff the scented air  Before them swiftly flies the tim'rous hare  O'er hills and vales the sprightly coursers bound  While varioussounding musick floats around  The joyous youth pursue the noble chace  Fresh health and vigor blooming in their face  Unknown to those who drink the night away  And waste in dozing idleness the day  As o'er the chequer'd landscape Fancy strays  Nature a thousand sylvan scenes displays  Plantations risethe hills and vallies smile  With various groves that suit the various soil  Dry rising ground the spreading beech improves  Wet spungy earth the weeping willow loves  In vales the stately elms delight to grow  And pines rejoice upon the mountain's brow  So should the parent with judicious care  If tender youth with plants we may compare  Explore the temper of his children's mind  And six them where their genius seems inclin'd  This  son delights the flaming sword to wield  And longs to thunder in the martial field  A merchant  that  and plows the foaming main  While milder natures cultivate the plain  Nor woods alone the pleasing prospect grace  The Naiads and the Dryads oft embrace  See thro' the groves descend the winding streams  To pay their liquid tribute to the Thames  First chalky Wey for rav'nous pikes renown'd  Rolls thro' the meads and fructifies the ground  His milky waves enrich the thirsty soil  And joyous crops reward the mower's toil  Next gentle Mole thro' shady vallies strays  And under ground her silent wave conveys  The Muse shall sing the cause if fame be true  And tell what judgments Avarice pursue  Mole once a woodnymph beautiful and vain  Like modern beauties thirsted after gain  The sordid passion mov'd her to explore  Hills vallies rocks and caves for glitt'ring ore  And as she o'er the Surry mountains rov'd  Pan saw the beauteous dame he saw and lov'd  In tender verse he fung his pleasing pains  And tun'd his oaten pipe to am'rous strains  Ten thousand fleecy flocks he cry'd are mine  Indulge my flame my fleecy flocks are thine  In vain he strives her cruel breast to move  She scorns alike his musick and his love  Next old Sylvanus left his sacred wood  And smitten with her charms the nymph pursu'd  Return my passion lovely maid he cry'd  Nor scorn the forests where the gods reside  In vain he strives her cruel breast to move  She scorns alike his forests and his love  Apollo next advancing to the dame  In tuneful numbers told his am'rous flame  Long sung the god and long the list'ning maid  Was pleas'd to hear the courtship Phoebus paid  Till grasping eager to enjoy her charms  She swiftly turn'd and glided from his arms  When from a cave a dusky Gnome arose  And various rocks of gold and di'mond shows  And here says he delight your eyes behold  These flaming jewels this attractive gold  Ten thousand treasures in my palace shine  Love me ten thousand treasures shall be thine  So saying down the cave he shot in haste  The yielding damsel follow'd him as fast  Then quickly sunk into his longing arms  And in a golden grot resign'd her charms  Apollo to revenge his slighted flame  Into a sullen stream converts the dame  And since she durst despise the god of day  The god depriv'd her of his chearful ray  Condemn'd her justly under ground to flow  And visit mines of glitt'ring dirt below  'Tis hence her lazy waves impurely glide  Till Thames refines them in his crystal tide  Thames on whose banks a stately  Hampton court which was first built by cardinal Wolsey enlarg'd by K Henry the th and nobly finish'd by K William the d  frame appears  Finish'd by glorious William's gen'rous cares  The stern imperious monarch of our isle  Eliza's sire enlarg'd the noble pile  And made it wear a more majestic face  Yet still it wanted symmetry and grace  Till William form'd the spacious courts complete  Bade strength and order use and beauty meet  And rais'd the fabric uniformly great  By equal steps our church and state improv'd  'Twas Henry first the papal yoke remov'd  But government religion and the law  Were settled by the wisdom of Nassau  For this he bravely cross'd the stormy main  Whilst adverse winds and waves oppos'd in vain  When kings deceiv'd with dreams of right divine  Had stretch'd their pow'r beyond its true design  When laws and liberty expiring lay  And Britain mourn'd an arbitrary sway  Great William born to succour human race  Reform'd our government and fix'd it's base  Restor'd our laws made freedom smile again  And to confirm them bade Augustus reign  O'er Twit'nam bow'rs I next direct my sight  Where nature art and elegance unite  Three graces which on Radnor's will attend  To deck the mansion of their noble friend  From hence a lofty  Richmond hill  hill attracts my eyes  Round which a thousand various beauties rise  Yet tho' it can such various beauties boast  Extensive bounty dignifies it most  Rise Muse and catch a spark of heav'nly flame  To celebrate the gen'rous Richmond  Mrs Knipe of Richmond whose truely christian virtues and extensive charities should I describe particularly the note would  longer than the poem  dame  Who modish pleasures bravely has withstood  And dares be most unfashionably good  Who feeds the hungry succours the distress'd  Is daily blessing others daily bless'd  Nor to their bodies is her care confin'd  Her care with christian knowledge forms the mind  Her pious  Religious books which this lady sends to America  treasures reach remotest lands  New worlds are bless'd with bounties from her hands  O would the deathless Muse my tongue inspire  Or Phoebus warm me with celestial fire  To sing her virtues and record her praise  Her fame should live immortal in my lays  The man of Ross's celebrated name  Should yield in honour to the Richmond dame  Not far remote appear the  Richmond gardens  verdant scenes  The groves which once imbow'r'd the best of queens  Whose bounty rais'd the meanest Muse's wing  And bade the poorest bard rejoyce and sing  While flocks in vernal pastures shall delight  While sun and moon divide the day and night  While mem'ry holds her traces in the brain  My grateful heart her goodness shall retain  Muse quit the subject nor renew the tide  Of tears that flow'd when Carolina dy'd  Then wept the willows sigh'd the conscious bow'rs  Then droop'd the myrtles and decay'd the flow'rs  Again the flow'rs a blooming aspect wear  Is she return'd or is Augusta here  Yes here Augusta with her children roves  A widow'd Venus with her little loves  Who round their mother fondly sport and toy  Their mother smiles  rejoycing in their joy  Here could the grateful Muse contemplate long  But other subjects claim the Muse's song  Windsor that wing'd the nervous Denham's flight  Adorn'd with lofty tow'rs attracts the sight  Where strength and dignity and beauty meet  Gracefully bold majestically sweet  Thy forests Windsor equal praises claim  And  now  shall flourish in immortal fame  Since GEORGE has thither sent his martial son  To plant the laurels which his valour won  When on Culloden's field he bravely stood  'Mid storms of fire and deluges of blood  Pouring his Father's thunder on his foes  To rescue Albion from impending woes  But now rebellious wars and tumults cease  He cultivates the milder arts of peace  Embellishes the hills with waving woods  And thro' the valley leads expansive floods  Or bids the stately Belvidere ascend  Or wond'rous arches o'er the water bend  Subdues the rude rough wildness of the soil  Adorns the waste with groves and bids the desart smile  Thrice happy had it been for human kind  Had Caesar thus employ'd his martial mind  Had he like glorious Cumberland subdu'd  His country's foes then peaceful arts pursu'd  His hostile eagles ne'er had stretch'd their wings  To ravage Albion and dethrone her kings  Nor had the Druids mourn'd their groves when round  This Hill he form'd his military mound  As thoughts like these revolv'd within my breast  Intruding sleep my weary eyes opprest  Yet mimic Fancy still pursu'd her theme  And painted Caesar present in my dream  My dream the faithful Muse remembers well  And what the Muse remembers she shall tell  As round this Hill the Roman army lay  The neighb'ring vale became their destin'd prey  To feed them fruitful fields their harvests lend  To fence their Camp the lofty woods descend  But while the legions fell'd a sacred oak  Thus to the chief a captive Druid spoke  Illustrious Robber when shall ruin cease  Thou enemy to property and peace  Is't not sufficient that your eagles soar  From Asia's empire to Iberia's shore  But must you shake  our  island with alarms  Must Britain  too  submit to Roman arms  Must all our crops be ravish'd from the land  Must all our forests fall beneath your hand  Yet tho' they fall by thy ambitious crimes  Again restor'd they rise in future times  I see those future timesI see with joy  Those who can faster plant than thou destroy  Thy Camp where now embattled legions shine  Shall bear the spreading beech and tow'ring pine  Roll swift ye yearsproduce the men of taste  To crown with verdant woods the barren waste  And lo they comeI see the sylvan swains  Whose shady groves shall decorate the plains  And owe their beauty many ages hence  To nature's children Hamilton and Spence  Spence shall in Nature's choicest mould be cast  Of manners gentle elegant of taste  In whom the passions shall so sweetly blend  He ne'er shall make a foe or lose a friend  Judicious learned and sincere of heart  Skill'd in the poet's and the planter's art  Whose care and culture shall rejoice the soil  And make the gloomy marshes round him smile  What pleasure shall he feel to form his grove  To plant new beauties and the old improve  To open vistas to the circling hill  Or wind about his mount the pleasing rill  Or shape the rounding walk that gently bends  Encompassing his  Alluding to a field of Mr Spence's which he calls the Field of Friendship  field of happy friends  Where oft he shall employ his virtuous mind  Contriving how to serve or mend mankind  Prescient of future times my mental eyes  See heroes statesmen peers and patriots rise  Who round thy Camp shall noble structures raise  And plant the paradise of latter days  When GEORGE the  If any person should be displeas'd with the word  Honest  and think it too common and vulgar an epithet for the best of monarchs I would beg the favour of him to read over the following passage which I have quoted from a French prelate's sermon preach'd before the parliament of Normandy and which is perhaps the boldest if not the best performance of the kind that has been published in France for some yearsAfter the good  Bp of Lizieux  bishop had been commending the French monarch he says Let us at the same time do justice to our neighbour king Let us speak of him as a king of wisdom and mercyLet us stile him GEORGE THE HONEST for if the general voice of sensible men and the voice of the representatives of a sensible people are to be credited he likewise merits that title A title rever'd by the greatest  Mr Pope  poet of his realm who truly says An honest man's the noblest work of God  HONEST shall the realm command  When York shall sit the themis of the land  An honour'd Briton Hamilton his name  Shall nobly beautify that silent stream  Whose curious

admire his stately woods  Delighted to survey the chequer'd scene  Of flow'ry lawns and groves for ever green  And vineyards pregnant with the gen'rous bowl  To chear the drooping heart and warm the frozen soul  Time shall produce a valiant Ligonier  Whom kings shall love and enemies shall fear  A glorious chief nor Caesar would disdain  Had fate allow'd to meet him on the plain  I see him calmly bold humanely brave  Expert to conquer generous to save  Intrepid when the martial trumpets sound  Content in peace to ornament the ground  To plant his woods to spread the lawn or lead  The docile river round his flow'ry mead  To open prospects from the mount above  Or walks below meand'ring thro' his grove  Such rural arts the hero shall engage  Arts nobler far than war's destructive rage  Cornwall shall cultivate the plain below  And make the lazy currents swifter flow  Hence to the poor his bounty shall be spread  The naked shall be cloath'd the hungry fed  That spacious field Newcastle shall adorn  And Plenty o'er it pour her copious horn  Hesperian fables are but types to show  What golden fruits shall in his garden grow  In vision  now  the whiten'd turrets rear  Their heads and shine conspicuous from afar  Shade above shade the lofty woods ascend  Below the lofty woods the lawns extend  Lawns open ample free as if design'd  An emblem of the lib'ral master's mind  While verdant groves around the whole unite  At once affording shelter and delight  But see his brotherpilot of the state  Anxious to steer the bark of Britain's fate  Upon the banks of Mole his mansion stands  Obedient nature aiding his commands  The rising hills adorn'd with waving woods  The sloping vales with flocks with fish the floods  A sweet variety with graceful ease  Contriv'd at once to profit and to please  Here sigh'd the sage as tho' his pensive breast  Labour'd with sorrows not to be exprest  Then thusUncertain state of humankind  How short the pleasures that employ their mind  Too soon must Pelham leave his beauteous scenes behind  And yet if pray'rs could move celestial Pow'rs  He longer should enjoy his Esher bow'rs  But pray'rs are vain in vain his children dear  And duteous wife shall pour the tender tear  In vain Britannia would prolong his breath  Her honest faithful statesman yields to death  Yet death adds lustre to his virtuous fame  As darkness gives the stars a brighter flame  Beneath thy Camp in distant times a  Mr Frederick  swain  With vivid greens shall plant the russet plain  The russet plain shall variegate the scenes  And add new beauties to the vivid greens  While gazing shepherds walk delighted by  Charm'd with the contrast grateful to their eye  Near him a noble  The Earl of Middlesex  bard his woods shall raise  And in their shades tune sweet his am'rous lays  Love's tender strains his bosom shall inspire  And animate his song with Dorset's fire  Portmore shall form another Cyprian grove  Where other lovely Venuses shall rove  Shall beautify the banks of silver Thames  And thro' his meadows call the winding streams  The rivergods obedient to his will  Shall thro' his garden roll the crystal rill  Lav'd with their urns the branching pines shall rise  And tall majestic cedars climb the skies  A farm shall turn a Tempe of delight  While gazing Naiads wonder at the sight  But who is he approaching thro' the shades  Whom handmaid Art attends and Nature leads  This shall be Southcoteeminently skill'd  To fix the rule of taste in Woburn field  I see his losty oaks advance their heads  I see the slope rejoice beneath their shades  The temple that adorns the rising brow  The lovely lawnembracing stream below  That gently winds and smoothly ling'ring moves  Unwilling to forsake the blissful groves  The terrace where the branching pines arise  Where op'ning prospects suddenly surprize  The soft acacias with their varied green  Diffusing shades around the sylvan scene  Acanthus jessamine and blushing rose  A blooming beauteous wilderness compose  While fragrant flow'rs embroider all the ground  Embellishing the walks and breathing odors round  What noble prospects open to my sight  Stupendous objects striking with delight  See Decker's arch magnificently bend  Decker the Public's voluntary friend  How opposite the motives of your mind  'Tis thine to ruin his to serve mankind  Not far remote a venerable sage  Woodford the silver'd ornament of age  Shall fix his seat in Nature's artless bow'rs  And there improve his philosophic hours  Till hoary Time shall end his studious days  In peaceful honour dignity and ease  What cannot art and human toil produce  Converting useless things to public use  A  The new river made navigable from Weybridge to Guilford  river o'er that barren heath shall flow  And vessels swim where pointed thistles grow  Upon the pleasing borders of the flood  I see a rising hospitable wood  Where glades shall open verdant lawns extend  And northern pines to kiss the elouds ascend  Where birds and beasts at liberty shall rove  And future ages call it Cote's grove  Where wanton fawns shall skip and tim'rous hares  Shall feed securely and forget their fears  But ah their fears returnwho gave them food  Pursues them thro' the field and echoing wood  To hunt the puny prey his bosom glows  The only cruel joy his bosom knows  Here paus'd the Druid for his heaving breast  Now swell'd with scenes superior to the rest  Then thus againWhat noble prospects rise  What majesty and beauty strike my eyes  The grand and amiable together meet  The awful terrace and the happy seat  The slope descending to the plain below  Where gently winding waters calmly flow  Till lost in shades the broad extensive streams  Look like a bending bay of silver Thames  Here Nature's boldest beauties are design'd  Fly swistly Timelet Lincoln bless mankind  He comes humanely gen'rous and polite  In whom the courtier patron friend unite  Bless'd with a consort gracefully serene  Who walks a goddess o'er the vendant scene  Wak'd with the pleasing sound of Lincoln's name  I felt my bosom glow with grateful flame  For after many storms and tempests past  He brought me to this quiet port at last  My fondest wish was such a rural scene  The sage's pray'r was such a golden mean  Above pale Poverty's dejected state  Below the storms which often wreck the great  Remote from giddy crowds and noisy strife  Yet near the few whose converse sweetens life  Here let me livebe mindful of my end  Adore my Maker and enjoy my friend  That friend to whomofficious Muse forbear  Nor with distasteful numbers wound his ear  His ear too delicate to hear the lay  His virtues claim and gratitude would pay  FINIS
