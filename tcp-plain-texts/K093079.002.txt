 A COLLECTION of POEMS  THE SECOND EDITION  VOL II  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN FOUR VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed for G PEARCH No CHEAPSIDE MDCCLXX  Isaac Taylor del et sculp  ORIENTAL ECLOGUES  BY MR WILLIAM COLLINS  ECLOGUE I  SELIM OR THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL  SCENE A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT TIME THE MORNING  YE Persian maids attend your Poet's lays  And hear how shepherds pass their golden days  Not all are blest whom Fortune's hand sustains  With wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains  Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell  'Tis virtue makes the bliss where'er we dwell  Thus Selim sung by sacred Truth inspir'd  Nor praise but such as Truth bestow'd desir'd  Wise in himself his meaning songs convey'd  Informing morals to the shepherd maid  Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find  What groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind  When sweet and blushing like a virgin bride  The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride  When wanton gales along the vallies play  Breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away  By Tygris' wandering waves he sat and sung  This useful lesson for the fair and young  Ye Persian dames he said to you belong  Well may they please the morals of my song  No fairer maids I trust than you are found  Grac'd with soft arts the peopled world around  The morn that lights you to your loves supplies  Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes  For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow  And yours the love that kings delight to know  Yet think not these all beauteous as they are  The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair  Who trust alone in Beauty's feeble ray  Boast but the worth  The gulph of that name famous for the pearl fishery  Balsora's pearls display  Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright  But dark within they drink no lustrous light  Such are the maids and such the charms they boast  By sense unaided or to virtue lost  Selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain  That Love shall blind when once he fires the swain  Or hope a lover by your faults to win  As spots on ermin beautify the skin  Who seeks secure to rule be first her care  Each softer virtue that adorns the fair  Each tender passion man delights to find  The lov'd perfection of a female mind  Blest were the days when Wisdom held her reign  And shepherds sought her on the silent plain  With Truth she wedded in the secret grove  Immortal Truth and daughters bless'd their love  O haste fair maids ye Virtues come away  Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way  The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore  By Ind excell'd or Araby no more  Lost to our fields for so the Fates ordain  The dear deserters shall return again  Come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear  To lead the train sweet Modesty appear  Here make thy court amidst our rural scene  And shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen  With thee be Chastity of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious maid  But man the mostnot more the mountain doe  Holds the swift salcon for her deadly foe  Cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew  A silken veil conceals her from the view  No wild desires amidst thy train be known  But Faith whose heart is fix'd on one alone  Desponding Meekness with her downcast eyes  And friendly Pity full of tender sighs  And Love the last by these your hearts approve  These are the virtues that must lead to love  Thus sung the swain and ancient legends say  The maids of Bagdat verified the lay  Dear to the plains the Virtues came along  The shepherds lov'd and Selim bless'd his song  ECLOGUE II  HASSAN OR THE CAMELDRIVER  SCENE THE DESERT TIME MIDDAY  IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste  The driver Hassan with his camels past  One cruise of water on his back he bore  And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store  A fan of painted feathers in his hand  To guard his shaded face from scorching sand  The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky  And not a tree and not an herb was nigh  The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue  Shrill roar'd the winds and dreary was the view  With desperate sorrow wild th' affrighted man  Thrice sigh'd thrice struck his breast and thus began  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Ah little thought I of the blasting wind  The thirst or pinching hunger that I find  Bethink thee Hassan where shall thirst asswage  When fails this cruise his unrelenting rage  Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign  Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine  Ye mute companions of my toils that bear  In all my griefs a more than equal share  Here where no springs in murmurs break away  Or mosscrown'd fountains mitigate the day  In vain ye hope the green delights to know  Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow  Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are sound  And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Curst be the gold and silver which persuade  Weak men to follow farfatiguing trade  The lilly peace outshines the silver store  And life is dearer than the golden ore  Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown  To every distant mart and wealthy town  Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea  And are we only yet repay'd by thee  Ah why this ruin so attractive made  Or why fond man so easily betray'd  Why heed we not while mad we haste along  The gentle voice of Peace or Pleasure's song  Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side  The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O cease my fearsall frantic as I go  When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe  What if the lion in his rage I meet  Oft in the dust I view his printed feet  And fearful oft when Day's declining light  Yields her pale empire to the mourner Night  By hunger rous'd he scours the groaning plain  Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train  Before them Death with shrieks directs their way  Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep  If aught of rest I find upon my sleep  Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around  And wake to anguish with a burning wound  Thrice happy they the wise contented poor  From lust of wealth and dread of death secure  They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find  Peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O hapless youth for she thy love hath won  The tender Zara will be most undone  Big swell'd my heart and own'd the powerful maid  When fast she dropt her tears as thus she said  " Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  " Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain  " Yet as thou go'st may every blast arise  " Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  " Safe o'er the wild no perils may'st thou see  " No griefs endure nor weep false youth like me"  O let me safely to the fair return  Say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn  O let me teach my heart to lose its fears  Recall'd by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears  He said and call'd on heaven to bless the day  When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way  ECLOGUE III  ABRA OR THE GEORGIAN SULTANA  SCENE A FOREST TIME THE EVENING  IN Georgia's land where Tefflis' towers are seen  In distant view along the level green  While evening dews enrich the glittering glade  And the tall forests cast a longer shade  What time 'tis sweet o'er fields of rice to stray  Or scent the breathing maize at setting day  Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove  Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love  Of Abra first began the tender strain  Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain  At morn she came those willing flocks to lead  Where lillies rear them in the watery mead  From early dawn the livelong hours she told  'Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold  Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade  A various wreathe of odorous flowers she made  That these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of Persia see the Modern History of the ingenious Mr Salmon  Gay motley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose  The violet blue that on the mossbank grows  Allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there  The finish'd chaplet well adorn'd her hair  Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray  By love conducted from the chace away  Among the vocal vales he heard her song  And sought the vales and echoing groves among  At length he found and wooed the rural maid  She knew the monarch and with fear obey'd  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  The royal lover bore her from the plain  Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her view  And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu  Fair happy maid to other scenes remove  To richer scenes of golden power and love  Go leave the simple pipe and shepherd's strain  With love delight thee and with Abbas reign  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Yet midst the blaze of courts she fix'd her love  On the cool fountain or the shady grove  Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind  To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclin'd  And oft as Spring renew'd the plains with flowers  Breath'd his soft gales and led the fragrant Hours  With sure return she sought the sylvan scene  The breezy mountains and the forests green  Her maids around her mov'd a duteous band  Each bore a crook allrural in her hand  Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung  With joy the mountain and the forest rung  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  And oft the royal lover left the care  And thorns of state attendant on the fair  Oft to the shades and low roof'd cots retir'd  Or sought the vale where first his heart was fir'd  A russet mantle like a swain he wore  And thought of crowns and busy courts no more  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Blest was the life that royal Abbas led  Sweet was his love and innocent his bed  What if in wealth the noble maid excel  The simple shepherd girl can love as well  Let those who rule on Persia's jewell'd throne  Be fam'd for love and gentlest love alone  Or wreathe like Abbas full of fair renown  The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown  O happy days the maids around her say  O haste profuse of blessings haste away  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  ECLOGUE IV  AGIB AND SECANDER OR THE FUGITIVES  SCENE A MOUNTAIN IN CIRCASSIA TIME MIDNIGHT  IN fair Circassia where to love inclin'd  Each swain was blest for every maid was kind  At that still hour when awful midnight reigns  And none but wretches haunt the twilight plains  What time the moon had hung her lamp on high  And past in radiance thro' the cloudless sky  Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds sled  Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led  Fast as they prest their flight behind them lay  Wide ravag'd plains and vallies stole away  Along the mountain's bending sides they ran  'Till faint and weak Secander thus began  SECANDER  O stay thee Agib for my feet deny  No longer friendly to my life to fly  Friend of my heart O turn thee and survey  Trace our sad flight thro' all its length of way  And first review that longextended plain  And yon wide groves already past with pain  Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried  And last this lofty mountain's weary side  AGIB  Weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know  The toils of flight or some severer woe  Still as I haste the Tartar shouts behind  And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind  In rage of heart with ruin in his hand  He blasts our harvests and deforms our land  Yon citron grove whence first in fear we came  Drops its fair honours to the conquering flame  Far fly the swains like us in deep despair  And leave to russian bands their fleecy care  SECANDER  Unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword  In vain unheard thou call'st thy Persian lord  In vain thou court'st him helpless to thine aid  To shield the shepherd and protect the maid  Far off in thoughtless indolence resign'd  Soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind  'Midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy  No wars alarm him and no fears annoy  AGIB  Yet these green hills in summer's sultry heat  Have lent the monarch oft a cool retreat  Sweet to the sight is Zabra's flowery plain  And once by maids and shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the virgins shall delight to rove  By Sargis' banks or Irwan's shady grove  On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale  Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale  Fair scenes but ah no more with peace possest  With ease alluring and with plenty blest  No more the shepherds whitening tents appear  Nor the kind products of a bounteous year  No more the date with snowy blossoms crown'd  But Ruin spreads her baleful fires around  SECANDER  In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair  Their eyes blue languish and their golden hair  Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send  Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend  AGIB  Ye Georgian swains that piteous learn from far  Circassia's ruin and the waste of war  Some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare  To shield your harvests and defend your fair  The Turk and Tartar like designs pursue  Fix'd to destroy and stedfast to undo  Wild as his land in native deserts bred  By lust incited or by malice led  The villain Arab as he prowls for prey  Oft marks with blood and wasting flames the way  Yet none so cruel as the Tartar foe  To death inur'd and nurs'd in scenes of woe  He said when loud along the vale was heard  A shriller shriek and nearer fires appear'd  Th' affrighted shepherds thro' the dews of night  Wide o'er the moonlight hills renew'd their flight  ODE ON THE DEATH OF MR JAMES THOMSON  BY THE SAME  IN yonder  The scene of the following stanzas is supposed to lie on the Thames near Richmond  grove a Druid lies  Where slowly winds the stealing wave  The year's best sweets shall duteous rise  To deck its Poet's sylvan grave  In yon deep bed of whispering reeds  His airy harp  The harp of Aeolus of which see a description in the Castle of Indolence  shall now be laid  That he whose heart in sorrow bleeds  May love thro' life the soothing shade  Then maids and youths shall linger here  And while its sounds at distance swell  Shall sadly seem in Pity's ear  To hear the woodland pilgrim's knell  Remembrance oft shall haunt the shore  When Thames in summer wreaths is drest  And oft suspend the dashing oar  To bid his gentle spirit rest  And oft as Ease and Health retire  To breezy lawn or forest deep  The friend shall view yon whitening  Richmond church  spire  And mid the varied landscape weep  But thou who own'st that earthy bed  Ah what will every dirge avail  Or tears which Love and Pity shed  That mourn beneath the gliding sail  Yet lives there one whose heedless eye  Shall scorn thy pale shrine glimmering near  With him sweet Bard may Fancy die  And Joy desert the blooming year  But thou lorn stream whose sullen tide  No sedgecrown'd Sisters now attend  Now waft me from the greenhill's side  Whose cold turf hides the buried friend  And see the fairy valleys fade  Dun Night has veil'd the solemn view  Yet once again dear parted shade  Meek Nature's child again adieu  The genial meads assign'd to bless  Thy life shall mourn thy early doom  Their hinds and shepherdgirls shall dress  With simple hands thy rural tomb  Long long thy stone and pointed clay  Shall melt the musing Briton's eyes  O vales and wild woods shall he say  In yonder grave your Druid lies  ODE TO PITY  BY THE SAME  O Thou the friend of man assign'd  With balmy hands his wounds to bind  And charm his frantic woe  When first Distress with dagger keen  Broke forth to waste his destin'd scene  His wild unsated foe  By Pella's  Euripides  bard a magic name  By all the griefs his thought could frame  Receive my humble rite  Long Pity let the nations view  Thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue  And eyes of dewy light  But wherefore need I wander wide  To old Ilissus' distant side  Deserted stream and mute  Wild Arun  A river in Sussex  too has heard thy strains  And Echo 'midst my native plains  Been sooth'd by Pity's lute  There first the wren thy myrtles shed  On gentlest Otway's infant head  To him thy cell was shown  And while he sung the female heart  With youth's soft notes unspoil'd by art  Thy turtles mix'd their own  Come Pity come by Fancy's aid  Even now my thoughts relenting maid  Thy temple's pride design  Its southern site its truth compleat  Shall raise a wild enthusiast heat  In all who view the shrine  There Picture's toils shall well relate  How chance or hard involving fate  O'er mortal bliss prevail  The buskin'd Muse shall near her stand  And sighing prompt her tender hand  With each disastrous tale  There let me oft retir'd by day  In dreams of passion melt away  Allow'd with thee to dwell  There waste the mournful lamp of night  Till Virgin thou again delight  To hear a British shell  ODE TO SIMPLICITY  BY THE SAME  O Thou by Nature taught  To breathe her genuine thought  In numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong  Who first on mountains wild  In Fancy loveliest child  Thy babe or Pleasure's nurs'd the powers of song  Thou who with hermit heart  Disdain'st the wealth of Art  And gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall  But com'st a decent maid  In Attic robe array'd  O chaste unboastful nymph to thee I call  By all the honey'd store  On Hybla's thymy shore  By all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear  By her whose lovelorn woe  In evening musings slow  Sooth'd sweetly sad Electra's poet's ear  By old Cephisus deep  Who spread his wavy sweep  In warbled wanderings round the green retreat  On whose enamel'd side  When holy Freedom died  No equal haunt allur'd thy future feet  O sister meek of Truth  To my admiring youth  Thy sober aid and native charms infuse  The flowers that sweetest breathe  Tho' Beauty cull'd the wreath  Still ask thy hand to range their order'd hues  While Rome could none esteem  But Virtue's patriot theme  You lov'd her hills and led the laureat band  But staid to sing alone  To one distinguish'd throne  And turn'd thy face and fled her alter'd land  No more in hall or bower  The passions own thy power  Love only love her forceless numbers mean  For thou hast left her shrine  Nor olive more nor vine  Shall gain thy feet to bless the servile scene  Tho' Taste tho' Genius bless  To some divine excess  Faint's the cold work till thou inspire the whole  What each what all supply  May court may charm your eye  Thou only thou canst raise the meeting soul  Of these let others ask  To aid some mighty task  I only seek to find thy temperate vale  Where oft my reed might sound  To maids and shepherds round  And all thy sons O Nature learn my tale  ODE TO PEACE  BY THE SAME  O Thou who bad'st thy turtles bear  Swift from his grasp thy golden hair  And sought'st thy native skies  When War by vultures drawn from far  To Britain bent his iron car  And bad his storms arise  Tir'd of his rude tyrannic sway  Our youth shall fix some festive day  His sullen shrines to burn  But thou who hear'st the turning spheres  What sounds may charm thy partial ears  And gain thy blest return  O Peace thy injur'd robes upbind  O rise and leave not one behind  Of all thy beamy train  The British lion goddess sweet  Lies stretch'd on earth to kiss thy feet  And own thy holier reign  Let others court thy transient smile  But come to grace thy western isle  By warlike Honour led  And while around her ports rejoice  While all her sons adore thy choice  With him for ever wed  ODE TO MERCY  BY THE SAME  STROPHE  O Thou who sit'st a smiling bride  By Valour's arm'd and awsul side  Gentlest of skyborn forms and best ador'd  Who oft with songs divine to hear  Win'st from his fatal grasp the spear  And hid'st in wreaths of flowers his bloodless sword  Thou who amidst the deathful field  By godlike chiefs alone beheld  Oft with thy bosom bare art found  Pleading for him the youth who sinks to ground  See Mercy see with pure and loaded hands  Before thy shrine my country's Genius stands  And decks thy altar still tho' pierc'd with many a wound  ANTISTROPHE  When he whom even our joys provoke  The Fiend of Nature join'd his yoke  And rush'd in wrath to make our isle his prey  Thy form from out thy sweet abode  O'ertook him on his blasted road  And stopp'd his wheels and look'd his rage away  I see recoil his sable steeds  That bore him swift to savage deeds  Thy tender melting eyes they own  O Maid for all thy love to Britain shown  Where Justice bars her iron tower  To thee we build a roseate bower  Thou thou shalt rule our queen and share our monarch's throne  ODE TO LIBERTY  BY THE SAME  STROPHE  WHO shall awake the Spartan fife  And call in solemn sounds to life  The youths whose locks divinely spreading  Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue  At once the breath of fear and virtue shedding  Applauding Freedom lov'd of old to view  What new Alcaeus  Alluding to a beautiful fragment of Alcaeus  fancyblest  Shall sing the sword in myrtles drest  At Wisdom's shrine awhile its flame concealing  What place so fit to seal a deed renown'd  Till she her brightest lightnings round revealing  It leap'd in glory forth and dealt her prompted wound  O Goddess in that feeling hour  When most its sounds would court thy ears  Let not my shell's misguided power  E'er draw thy sad thy mindful tears  No Freedom no I will not tell  How Rome before thy weeping face  With heaviest sound a giantstatue fell  Push'd by a wild and artless race  From off its wide ambitious base  When Time his northern sons of spoil awoke  And all the blended work of strength and grace  With many a rude repeated stroke  And many a barbarous yell to thousand fragments broke  EPODE  Yet even where'er the least appear'd  Th' admiring world thy hand rever'd  Still 'midst the scatter'd states around  Some remnants of her strength were found  They saw by what escap'd the storm  How wonderous rose her perfect form  How in the great the labour'd whole  Each mighty master pour'd his soul  For sunny Florence seat of art  Beneath her vines preserv'd a part  Till they  The family of the Medici  whom Science lov'd to name  O who could fear it i quench'd her flame  And lo an humbler relic laid  In jealous Pisa's olive shade  See small Marino  The little republic of San Marino  joins the theme  Tho' least not last in thy esteem  Strike louder strike th' ennobling strings  To those  The Venetians  whose merchant sons were kings  To him  The Doge of Venice  who deck'd with pearly pride  In Adria weds his greenhair'd bride  Hail port of glory wealth and pleasure  Ne'er let me change this Lydian measure  Nor e'er her former pride relate  To sad Liguria's  Genoa  bleeding state  Ah no more pleas'd thy haunts I seek  On wild Helvetia's  Switzerland  mountains bleak  Where when the favour'd of thy choice  The daring archer heard thy voice  Forth from his eyrie rous'd in dread  The ravening eagle northward fled  Or dwell in willow'd meads more near  With those  The Dutch among whom there are very severe penalties for those who are convicted of killing this bird They are kept tame in almost all their towns and particularly at the Hague of the arms of which they make a part The common people of Holland are said to entertain a superstitious sentiment that if the whole species of them shou'd become extinct they should lose their liberties  to whom thy stork is dear  Those whom the rod of Alva bruis'd  Whose crown a British queen  Queen Elizabeth  refus'd  The magic works thou feel'st the strains  One holier name alone remains  The perfect spell shall then avail  Hail nymph ador'd by Britain hail  ANTISTROPHE  Beyond the measure vast of thought  The works the wizzard Time has wrought  The Gaul 'tis held of antique story  Saw Britain link'd to his now adverse strand  This tradition is mentioned by several of our old historians Some naturalists too have endeavoured to support the probability of the fact by arguments drawn from the correspondent disposition of the two opposite coasts I do not remember that any poetical use has been hitherto made of it    No sea between nor cliff sublime and hoary  He pass'd with unwet feet thro' all our land  To the blown Baltic then they say  The wild waves found another way  Where Orcas howls his wolfish mountains rounding  Till all the banded West at once 'gan rise  A wide wild storm even Nature's self confounding  Withering her giant sons with strange uncouth surprise  This pillar'd earth so firm and wide  By winds and inward labours torn  In thunders dread was push'd aside  And down the should'ring billows born  And see like gems her laughing train  The little isles on every side  Mona  There is a tradition in the isle of Man that a mermaid becoming enamoured of a young man of extraordinary beauty took an opportunity of meeting him one day as he walked on the shore and opened her passion to him but was received with a coldness occasioned by his horror and surprise at her appearance This however was so misconstrued by the sealady that in revenge for his treatment of her she punish'd the whole island by covering it with a mist so that all who attempted to carry on any commerce with it either never arrived at it but wandered up and down the sea or were on a sudden wrecked upon its cliffs  once hid from those who search the main  Where thousand elsin shapes abide  And Wight who checks the westering tide  For thee consenting heaven has each bestow'd  A fair attendant on her sovereign pride  To thee this blest divorce she ow'd  For thou hast made her vales thy lov'd thy last abode  SECOND EPODE  Then too 'tis said an hoary pile  'Midst the green navel of our isle  Thy shrine in some religious wood  O soulenforcing goddess stood  There oft the painted native's feet  Were wont thy form celestial meet  Tho' now with hopeless toil we trace  Time's backward rolls to find its place  Whether the fierytressed Dane  Or Roman's self o'erturn'd the fane  Or in what heavenleft age it fell  'Twere hard for modern song to tell  Yet still if Truth those beams infuse  Which guide at once and charm the Muse  Beyond yon braided clouds that lie  Paving the lightembroider'd sky  Amidst the Bright pavillion'd plains  The beauteous model still remains  There happier than in islands blest  Or bowers by Spring or Hebe drest  The chiefs who fill our Albion's story  In warlike weeds retir'd in glory  Hear their consorted Druids sing  Their triumphs to th' immortal string  How may the poet now unfold  What never tongue or numbers told  How learn delighted and amaz'd  What hands unknown that fabric rais'd  Even now before his favour'd eyes  In Gothic pride it seems to rise  Yet Graecia's graceful orders join  Majestic thro' the mix'd design  The secret builder knew to chuse  Each spherefound gem of richest hues  Whate'er heaven's purer mould contains  When nearer suns emblaze its veins  There on the walls the patriot's sight  May ever hang with fresh delight  And grav'd with some prophetic rage  Read Albion's same thro' every age  Ye forms divine ye laureat band  That near her inmost altar stand  Now sooth her to her blisssul train  Blythe Concord's social form to gain  Concord whose myrtle wand can steep  Even Anger's bloodshot eyes in sleep  Before whose breathing bosom's balm  Rage drops his steel and storms grow calm  Her let our sires and matrons hoar  Welcome to Britain's ravag'd shore  Our youths enamour'd of the fair  Play with the tangles of her hair  Till in one loud applauding found  The nations shout to her around  O how supremely art thou blest  Thou Lady thou shalt rule the west  ODE TO FEAR  BY THE SAME  THOU to whom the world unknown  With all its shadowy shapes is shown  Who seest appall'd th' unreal scene  While Fancy lifts the veil between  Ah Fear ah frantic Fear  I see I see thee near  I know thy hurried step thy haggard eye  Like thee I start like thee disorder'd fly  For lo what monsrers in thy train appear  Danger whose limbs of giant mold  What mortal eye can fix'd behold  Who stalks his round an hideous form  Howling amidst the midnight storm  Or throws him on the ridgy steep  Of some loose hanging rock to sleep  And with him thousand phantoms join'd  Who prompt to deeds accurs'd the mind  And those the fiends who near allied  O'er Nature's wounds and wrecks preside  While Vengeance in the lurid air  Lifts her red arm expos'd and bare  On whom that ravening brood of Fate  Who lap the blood of Sorrow wait  Who Fear this ghastly train can see  And look not madly wild like thee  EPODE  In earliest Greece to thee with partial choice  The grieffull Muse addrest her infant tongue  The maids and matrons on her awful voice  Silent and pale in wild amazement hung  Yet he the Bard  Aeschylus  who first invok'd thy name  Disdain'd in Marathon its power to feel  For not alone he nurs'd the poet's flame  But reach'd from Virtue's hand the patriot's steel  But who is he whom later garlands grace  Who left awhile o'er Hybla's dews to rove  With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace  Where thou and furies shar'd the baleful grove  Wrapt in thy cloudy veil th' incestuous Queen  Jocasta  Sigh'd the sad call her son and husband heard  When once alone it broke the silent scene  And he the wretch of Thebes no more appear'd  O Fear I know thee by my throbbing heart  Thy withering power inspir'd each mournful line  Tho' gentle Pity claim her mingled part  Yet all the thunders of the scene are thine  ANTISTROPHE  Thou who such weary lengths hast past  Where wilt thou rest mad Nymph at last  Say wilt thou shroud in haunted cell  Where gloomy Rape and Murder dwell  Or in some hallow'd seat  'Gainst which the big waves beat  Hear drowning seamens cries in tempests brought  Dark Power with shuddering meek submitted thought  Be mine to read the visions old  Which thy awakening bards have told  And lest thou meet my blasted view  Hold each strange tale devoutly true  Ne'er be I found by thee o'eraw'd  In that thricehallow'd eve abroad  When ghosts as cottagemaids believe  Their pebbled beds permitted leave  And goblins haunt from fire or fen  Or mine or flood the walks of men  O thou whose spirit most possest  The sacred seat of Shakespear's breast  By all that from thy Prophet broke  In thy divine emotions spoke  Hither again thy fury deal  Teach me but once like him to feel  His cypress wreath my meed decree  And I O Fear will dwell with thee  ODE ON THE POETICAL CHARACTER  BY THE SAME  AS once if not with light regard  I read aright that gifted Bard  Him whose school above the rest  His loveliest Elsin queen has blest  One only one unrivall'd fair  Florimel See Spenser Leg th  Might hope the magic girdle wear  At solemn turney hung on high  The wish of each lovedarting eye  Lo to each other nymp in turn applied  As if in air unseen some hovering hand  Some chaste and angelfriend to virgin fame  With whisper'd spell had burst the starting band  It left unblest her loath'd dishonour'd side  Happier hopeless fair if never  Her baffled hand with vain endeavour  Had touch'd that fatal zone to her denied  Young Fancy thus to me divinest name  To whom prepar'd and bath'd in heaven  The cest of amplest power is given  To few the god like gift assignt  To gird their blest prophetic loins  And gaze her visions wild and feel unmix'd her flame  The band as fairy legends say  Was wove on that creating day  When he who call'd with thought to birth  Yon tented sky this laughing earth  And drest with springs and forests tall  And pour'd the main engirting all  Long by the lov'd enthusiast woo'd  Himself in some diviner mood  Retiring sat with her alone  And plac'd her on his saphire throne  The whiles the vaulted shrine around  Seraphic wires were heard to sound  Now sublimest triumph swelling  Now on love and mercy dwelling  And she from out the veiling cloud  Breath'd her magic notes aloud  And thou thou richhair'd youth of morn  And all thy subject life was born  The dangerous passions kept aloof  Far from the sainted growing woof  But near it sat ecstatic Wonder  Listening the deep applauding thunder  And Truth in sunny vest array'd  By whose the Tarsol's eyes were made  All the shadowy tribes of Mind  In braided dance their murmurs join'd  And all the bright uncounted Powers  Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers  Where is the Bard whose soul can now  Its high presuming hopes avow  Where he who thinks with rapture blind  This hallow'd work for him design'd  High on some cliff to heaven uppil'd  Of rude access of prospect wild  Where tangled round the jealous steep  Strange shades o'erbrow the vallies deep  And holy Genii guard the rock  Its glooms embrown its springs unlock  While on its rich ambitious head  An Eden like his own lies spread  I view that oak the fancy'd glades among  By which as Milton lay his evening ear  From many a cloud that dropp'd ethereal dew  Nigh spher'd in heaven its native strains could hear  On which that antient trump he reach'd was hung  Thither of his glory greeting  From Waller's myrtle shades retreating  With many a vow from Hope's aspiring tongue  My trembling feet his guiding steps pursue  In vainSuch bliss to one alone  Of all the sons of soul was known  And Heaven and Fancy kindred powers  Have now o'erturn'd th' inspiring bowers  Or curtain'd close such scene from every future view  THE MANNERS AN ODE  BY THE SAME  FArewell for clearer ken design'd  The dimdiscover'd tracts of mind  Truths which from action's paths retir'd  My silent search in vain requir'd  No more my sail that deep explores  No more I search those magic shores  What regions part the world of soul  Or whence thy streams Opinion roll  If e'er I round such fairy field  Some Power impart the spear and shield  At which the wizzard Passions fly  By which the giant Follies die  Farewell the porch whose roof is seen  Arch'd with th' enlivening olive's green  Where Science prank'd in tissu'd vest  By Reason Pride and Fancy drest  Comes like a bride so trim array'd  To wed with Doubt in Plato's shade  Youth of the quick uncheated sight  Thy walks Observance more invite  O thou who lov'st that ampler range  Where life's wide prospects round thee change  And with her mingling sons allied  Throw'st the prattling page aside  To me in converse sweet impart  To read in man the native heart  To learn where Science sure is found  From Nature as she lives around  And gazing oft her mirror true  By turns each shifting image view  Till meddling Art's officious lore  Reverse the lessons taught before  Alluring from a safer rule  To dream in her enchanted school  Thou heaven whate'er of great we boast  Hast blest this social science most  Retiring hence to thoughtful cell  As Fancy breathes her potent spell  Not vain she finds the charmful task  In pageant quaint in motley mask  Behold before her musing eyes  The countless Manners round her rise  While ever varying as they pass  To some Contempt applies her glass  With these the whiterob'd Maids combine  And those the laughing Satyrs join  But who is he whom now she views  In robe of wild contending hues  Thou by the Passions nurs'd I greet  The comic sock that binds thy feet  O Humour thou whose name is known  To Britain's favour'd isle alone  Me too amidst thy band admit  There where the youngey'd healthful Wit  Whose jewels in his crisped hair  Are plac'd each other's beams to share  Whom no delights from thee divide  In laughter loos'd attends thy side  By old Miletus  Alluding to the Milesian tales some of the earliest romances  who so long  Has ceas'd his loveinwoven song  By all you taught the Tuscan maids  In chang'd Italia's modern shades  By him  Cervantes  whose knight's distinguish'd name  Refin'd a nation's lust of fame  Whose tales even now with echoes sweet  Castilia's Moorish h lls repeat  Or him  Monsieur Le Sage author of the incomparable adventures of Gii Blas de Santillane who died in Paris in the year  whom Seine's blue nymphs deplore  In watchet weeds on Gallia's shore  Who drew the sad Sicilian maid  By virtues in her sire betray'd  O Nature boon from proceed  Each forceful thought each prompted deed  If but from thee I hope to feel  On all my heart imprint thy seal  Let some retreating Cynic find  Those oftturn'd scrolls I leave behind  The Sports and I this hour agree  To rove thy scenefull world with thee  THE PASSIONS AN ODE  BY THE SAME  WHEN Music heavenly maid was young  While yet in early Greece she sung  The Passions oft to hear her shell  Throng'd around her magic cell  Exulting trembling raging fainting  Possest beyond the Muse's painting  By turns they felt the glowing mind  Disturb'd delighted rais'd refin'd  Till once 'tis said when all were fir'd  Fill'd with fury rapt inspir'd  From the supporting myrtles round  They snatch'd her instruments of sound  And as they oft had heard apart  Sweet lessons of her sorceful art  Each for madness rul'd the hour  Would prove his own expressive power  First Fear his hand its skill to try  Amid the chords bewilder'd laid  And back recoil'd he knew not why  Even at the sound himself had made  Next Anger rush'd his eyes on fire  In lightnings own'd his secret stings  In one rude clash he struck the lyre  And swept with hurried hand the strings  With woeful measures wan Despair  Low sullen sounds his grief beguil'd  A solemn strange and mingled air  'Twas sad by fits by starts 'twas wild  But thou O Hope with eyes so fair  What was thy delighted measure  Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure  And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail  Still would her touch the strain prolong  And from the rocks the woods the vale  She call'd on Echo still thro' all the song  And where her sweetest theme she chose  A soft responsive voice was heard at every close  And Hope enchanted smil'd and wav'd her golden hair  And longer had she sungbut with a frown  Revenge impatient rose  He threw his bloodstain'd sword in thunder down  And with a withering look  The war denouncing trumpet took  And blew a blast so loud and dread  Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe  And ever and anon he beat  The doubling drum with furious heat  And tho' sometimes each dreary pause between  Dejected Pity at his side  Her soulsubduing voice applied  Yet still he kept his wild unalter'd mien  While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head  Thy numbers Jealousy to nought were fix'd  Sad proof of thy distressful state  Of differing themes the veering song was mix'd  And now it courted Love now raving call'd on Hate  With eyes uprais'd as one inspir'd  Pale Melancholy sat retir'd  And from her wild sequester'd seat  In notes by distance made more sweet  Pour'd thro' the mellow horn her pensive soul  And dashing soft from rocks around  Bubbling runnels join'd the sound  Thro' glades and glooms the mingled measure stole  Or o'er some haunted streams with fond delay  Round an holy calm diffusing  Love of peace and lonely musing  In hollow murmurs died away  But O how alter'd was its sprightlier tone  When Chearfulness a nymph of healthiest hue  Her bow across her shoulder flung  Her buskins gemm'd with morning dew  Blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung  The hunter's call to Faun and Dryad known  The oakcrown'd Sisters and their chasteeyed Queen  Satyrs and Sylvan boys were seen  Peeping from forth their alleys green  Brown Exercise rejoic'd to hear  And Sport leapt up and seiz'd his beechen spear  Last came Joy's ecstatic trial  He with viny crown advancing  First to the lively pipe his hand addrest  But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol  Whose sweet entrancing voice he lov'd the best  They would have thought who heard the strain  They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids  Amidst the festal sounding shades  To some unwearied minstrel dancing  While as his flying fingers kiss'd the strings  Love fram'd with Mirth a gay fantastic round  Loose were her tresses seen her zone unbound  And he amidst his frolic play  As if he would the charming air repay  Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings  O Music spheredescended maid  Friend of pleasure wisdom's aid  Why Goddess why to us denied  Lay'st thou thy antient lyre aside  As in that lov'd Athenian bower  You learn'd an allcommanding power  Thy mimic soul O nymph endear'd  Can well recall what then it heard  Where is thy native simple heart  Devote to virtue fancy art  Arise as in that elder time  Warm energic chaste sublime  Thy wonders in that godlike age  Fill thy recording Sister's page  'Tis said and I believe the tale  Thy humblest reed could more prevail  Had more of strength divinder rage  Than all which charms this laggard age  Even all at once together found  Caecilia's mingled world of sound  O bid our vain endeavours cease  Revive the just designs of Greece  Return in all thy simple state  Confirm the tales her sons relate  WRITTEN ON A PAPER WHICH CONTAINED A PIECE OF BRIDE CAKE GIVEN TO THE AUTHOR BY A LADY  BY THE SAME  YE curious hands that hid from vulgar eyes  By search profane shall find this hallow'd cake  With Virtue's awe forbear the sacred prize  Nor dare a theft for Love and Pity's sake  This precious relick form'd by magic power  Beneath the shepherd's haunted pillow laid  Was meant by Love to charm the silent hour  The secret present of a matchless maid  The Cyprian queen at Hymen's fond request  Each nice ingredient chose with happiest art  Fears sighs and wishes of th' enamour'd breast  And pains that please are mixt in every part  With rosy hand the spicy fruit she brought  From Paphian hills and fair Cythera's isle  And temper'd sweet with these the melting thought  The kiss ambrosial and the yielding smile  Ambiguous looks that scorn and yet relent  Denials mild and firm unalter'd truth  Reluctant pride and amorous faint consent  And meeting ardours and exulting youth  Sleep wayward God hath sworn while these remain  With flattering dreams to dry his nightly tear  And chearful Hope so oft invok'd in vain  With fairy songs shall sooth his pensive ear  If bound by vows to Friendship's gentle side  And fond of soul thou hop'st an equal grace  If youth or maid thy joys and griefs divide  O much intreated leave this fatal place  Sweet Peace who long hath shunn'd my plaintive day  Consents at length to bring me short delight  Thy careless steps may scare her doves away  And Grief with raven note usurp the night  LONDON OR THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE  BY MR GLOVER  YE northern blasts and  The east wind  Eurus

My freighted vessels to the destin'd shore  Safe o'er th' unruffled main let every thought  Which may disquiet and alarm my breast  Be absent now that dispossess'd of care  And free from every tumult of the mind  With each disturbing passion hush'd to peace  I may pour all my spirit on the theme  Which opens now before me and demands  The loftiest strain The eagle when he tow'rs  Beyond the clouds the fleecy robes of heaven  Disdains all objects but the golden sun  Full on th' effulgent orb directs his eye  And sails exulting through the blaze of day  So while her wing attempts the boldest flight  Rejecting each inferior theme of praise  Thee ornament of Europe Albion's pride  Fair seat of wealth and freedom thee my Muse  Shall celebrate O London thee she hails  Thou lov'd abode of Commerce last retreat  Whence she contemplates with a tranquil mind  Her various wanderings from the fated hour  That she abandon'd her maternal clime  Neptunian Commerce whom Phoenice bore  Illustrious nymph that nam'd the fertile plains  Along the sounding main extended far  Which flowery Carmel with its sweet perfumes  And with its cedars Libanus o'ershades  Her from the bottom of the watry world  As once she stood in radiant beauties grac'd  To mark the heaving tide the piercing eye  Of Neptune view'd enamour'd from the deep  The God ascending rushes to the beach  And clasps th' affrighted virgin From that day  Soon as the paly regent of the night  Nine times her monthly progress had renew'd  Thro' heaven's illumin'd vault Phoenice led  By shame once more the seaworn margin sought  There pac'd with painful steps the barren sands  A solitary mourner and the surge  Which gently roll'd beside her now no more  With placid eyes beholding thus exclaim'd  Ye fragrant shrubs and cedars lofty shade  Which crown my native hills ye spreading palms  That rise majestic on these fruitful meads  With you who gave the lost Phoenice birth  And you who bear th' endearing name of friends  Once faithful partners of my chaster hours  Farewell To thee perfidious God I come  Bent down with pain and anguish on thy sands  I come thy suppliant death is all I crave  Bid thy devouring waves inwrap my head  And to the bottom whelm my cares and shame  She ceas'd when sudden from th' inclosing deep  A crystal car emerg'd with glitt'ring shells  Cull'd from their oozy beds by Tethys' train  And blushing coral deck'd whose ruddy glow  Mix'd with the watry lustre of the pearl  A smiling band of seaborn nymphs attend  Who from the shore with gentle hands convey  The fearsubdu'd Phoenice and along  The lucid chariot place As there with dread  All mute and struggling with her painful throes  She lay the winds by Neptune's high command  Were silent round her not a zephyr dar'd  To wanton o'er the cedar's branching top  Nor on the plain the stately palm was seen  To wave its graceful verdure o'er the main  No undulation broke the smooth expanse  But all was hush'd and motionless around  All but the lightlysliding ear impell'd  Along the level azure by the strength  Of active Tritons rivalling in speed  The rapid meteor whose sulphureous train  Glides o'er the brow of darkness and appears  The livid ruins of a falling star  Beneath the Lybian skies a blissful isle  By  Triton a river and lake of antient Lybia  Triton's floods encircled Nysa lay  Here youthful Nature wanton'd in delights  And here the guardians of the bounteous horn  While it was now the infancy of time  Nor yet th' uncultivated globe had learn'd  To smile  Fruitfulness  Eucarpé  Plenty  Dapsiléa dwelt  With all the nymphs whose secret care had nurs'd  The eldest Bacchus From the flow'ry shore  A turfclad valley opens and along  Its verdure mild the willing feet allures  While on its sloping sides ascends the pride  Of hoary groves higharching o'er the vale  With dayrejecting gloom The solemn shade  Half round a spacious lawn at length expands  This whole description of the rock and grotto is taken from Diod Siculus lib pag  Clos'd by a tow'ring cliff whose forehead glows  With azure purple and ten thousand dyes  From its resplendent fragments beaming round  Nor less irradiate colours from beneath  On every side an ample grot reflects  As down the perforated rock the sun  Pours his meridian blaze rever'd abode  Of Nysa's nymphs with every plant attir'd  That wears undying green refresh'd with rills  From everliving fountains and enrich'd  With all Pomona's bloom unfading flowers  Glow on the mead and spicy shrubs perfume  With inexhausted sweets the cooling gale  Which breathes incessant there while every bird  Of tuneful note his gay or plaintive song  Blends with the warble of meandring streams  Which o'er their pebbled channels murm'ring lave  The

Which lifts th' ennobled spirit near to heaven  Laws learning wisdom nature's works reveal'd  By godlike Sages all Minerva's arts  Apollo's music and th' eternal voice  Of Virtue sounding from the

 Receives the gather'd riches of the world  In vain whole climates bow beneath its rule  Behold the toil of centuries to Rome  I  glories yields and mould'ring leaves no trace  Of its deeprooted

Ebro gath'ring all their powers  To crush this daring populace The pride  Of fiercest kings with more inflam'd revenge  Ne'er menac'd freedom nor since dauntless Greece  And Rome's stern offspring none hath e'er surpass'd  The bold  The Dutch  Batavian in his glorious toil  For liberty or death At once the thought  Of longlamented Carthage flies thy breast  And ardent Goddess thou dost speed to

VIRTUE A SATIRE  " LET venal annals boast a Caesar's reign  " When Rome's great genius hugg'd th' imperial chain  " Freedom gay Goddess glads our happier isle  " Peace smooths her brow as Plenty decks her smile  " In every son th' inspirer lives confess'd  " And lights up all the patriot in his breast  " Breathes the same social warmth from soul to soul  " Till widening Nature pants but for a whole  " Shines he in life's meridian beam display'd  " Or gives his milder virtues to the shade  " Glares the proud ribbon nods the martial crest  " Or flaunt the tatters on his motly vest  " The godlike Briton fills his every sphere  " Without a frailty and without a fear  " If rich Bright image of the Eternal Mind  " His opening bosom takes in all mankind  " Where'er he comes Health triumphs o'er Disease  " Hope glads Despair and Anguish melts to ease  " Is Knowledge his He lends his every art  " To rear the genius and to mould the heart  " Fondly pursues with Boyle's auspicious blaze  " Truth thro' her masques and Nature thro' her maze  " To heedless Justice gives the wellpoiz'd scale  " And raises Commerce as he guides the sail  " Is power his orb He lives but to defend  " The statesman only dignifies the friend  " Disarms Oppression prunes Ambition's wing  " And stifles Faction ere she darts her sting  " Enriches every coffer but his own  " And shields the cottage while he guards the throne  " Sees at his nod our plunder'd rights restor'd  " And Europe trembling when he grasps the sword"  Thus sung the Muse when Fancy vigorous ran  And warm'd the youth ere Reason form'd the

kind Nature felt her power  Soft blew the zephyr and soft sprung the flower  A brighter freshness hung on every green  And a new Eden stole upon the scene  Awhile she paus'd and with a frown survey'd  The mingling swarm of tatters and brocade  When as the Goddess wav'd th' ethereal spear  Pride dropt her smile and Artifice her tear  Lust threw aside Religion's borrow'd grace  A leering Satyr gloated in her face  The prude who fainted at the name of vice  Now hugg'd the bottle and now grasp'd the dice  While tortur'd with the town's obscener ail  A Saint stood melting o'er a luscious tale

Thanks to their rage my days will happier flow  And my joys brighten when a knave's my foe  Yet think not that the Muse to spleen resign'd  Aims monsterlike to swallow up mankind  Bids her keen shafts with baleful vengeance fly  Taint the pure breeze and poison half the sky  Or fond to spread destruction thro' the land  Exults with Nero as she lights the brand  With honest warmth she wishes to controul  Each deadly weed that blossoms on the soul  That wildly vigorous mocks at Virtue's toil  That choaks the scion and that robs the soil  But sadly conscious that just heaven has made  Each grace to border on its kindred shade  That in the gem some sullying vein will run  And the disk darken while there shines a sun  The melting image gains upon her heart  And spite of justice half

opening in her Paphos or the stew  Lethargic Justice on the bench assail  Edge the dull sword and poise th' unequal scale  With Rabelais' jest display th' officious knave  In life's mad vortex

TO THE MEMORY OF MRS MARGARET WOFFINGTON  She died the th of March    BY JOHN HOOLE  Flebilis indignos elegia solve capillos  Ah nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit  OVID  THERE fled the fair that all beholders charm'd  Whose beauty fir'd us and whose spirit warm'd  In that sad sigh th' unwilling breath retir'd  The grace the glory of our scene expir'd  And shall she die the Muse's rites unpaid  No grateful lays to deck her parting shade  While on her bier the sister Graces mourn  And weeping Tragedy bedews her urn  While Comedy her chearful vein foregoes  And learns to melt with unaccustom'd woes  Accept O once admir'd these artless lays  Accept this mite of tributary praise  Oh could I paint thee with a master's hand  And give thee all thy merits could demand  These lines should glow with true poetic flame  Bright as thy eyes and faultless as thy frame  We mourn'd thy absence from our scene retir'd  Each longing heart again thy charms desir'd  Yet still alas we hop'd again to view  Our wish our pleasure every joy in you  Again thy looks might grace the tragic rage  Again thy spirit fill the comic stage  But lo Disease hangs hovering o'er thy head  Dire Danger stalks around thy frighted bed  Those starry eyes have lost each beamy ray  And ghastly Sickness makes the fair her prey  Death shuts the sceneand all our hopes are o'er  Those beauties now must glad the sight no more  Say ye whose features youthful lustre bloom  Whose lips exhale Arabia's soft perfume  Must every gift in silent dust be lost  No more the wish of man or female boast  Ah me with time must every grace be fled  She once the pride of all our stage is dead  Clos'd are those eyes that every bosom fir'd  Pale are those charms that every heart inspir'd  Where now the mien with majesty endu'd  Which oft surpriz'd a ravish'd audience view'd  What forms too oft the tragic scene disgrace  What tasteless airs the comic scene deface  Tho' tuneful Cibber still the Muse sustains  By nature fram'd to pour the moving strains  Tho' from her eye each heartfelt passion breaks  And more than music warbles when she speaks  When shall we view again like thine conjoin'd  A form angelic and a piercing mind  Alike in every mimic scene to steer  The gay the grave the lively and severe  Thy judgment saw thy taste each beauty caught  No senseless parrot of the poet's thought  Thy bosom well cou'd heave with fancy'd woe  And from thy own our tears were taught to flow  Whene'er we view'd the Roman's sullied same  Thy beauty justify'd the hero's shame  What heart but then must Anthony approve  And own the world was nobly lost for love  What ears could hear in vain thy cause implor'd  When soothing arts appeas'd thy angry lord  Each tender breast the rough Ventidius blam'd  And Egypt gain'd the sigh Octavia claim'd  Thy eloquence each hush'd attention drew  While Love usurp'd the tears to Virtue due  See Phaedra rise majestic o'er the scene  What raging pangs distract the hapless Queen  How does thy sense the poet's thought refine  Beam thro' each word and brighten every line  What nerve what vigour glows in every part  While classic lays appear with classic art  Who now can bid the proud Roxana rise  With love and anger sparkling in her eyes  Who now shall bid her breast in fury glow  With all the semblance of imperial woe  While the big passion raging in her veins  Would hold the master of the world in chains  But Alexander now forsakes our coast  And ah Roxana is for ever lost  Nor less thy power when rigid Virtue fir'd  The chaster bard and purer thoughts inspir'd  What kneeling form appears with stedfast eyes  Her bosom heaving with Devotion's sighs  Tis she In thee we own the mournful scene  The fair resemblance of a martyr  Lady Jane Grey Act V  queen  Here Guido's skill might mark thy speaking frame  And catch from thee the painter's magic flame  Blest in each art by nature form'd to please  With beauty sense with elegance and ease  Whose piercing genius study'd all mankind  All Shakespear opening to thy vigorous mind  In every scene of comic humour known  In sprightly sallies wit was all thy own  Whether you seem'd the cit's more humble wife  Or shone in Townly's higher sphere of life  Alike thy spirit knew each turn of wit  And gave new force to all the poet writ  Nor was thy worth to public scenes confin'd  Thou knew'st the noblest feelings of the mind  Thy ears were ever open to distress  Thy ready hand was ever stretch'd to bless  The breast humane for each unhappy felt  Thy heart for other's sorrows prone to melt  In vain did Envy point her scorpion sting  In vain did Malice shake her blasting wing  Each generous breast disdain'd th' unpleasing tale  And cast o'er every fault Oblivion's veil  Consess'd thro' every cloud thy deeds to shine  And own'd the virtues of Compassion thine  Saw mild Benevolence her wand disclose  And touch thy heart at every sufferer's woes  Saw meekey'd Charity thy steps attend  And guide thy hand the wretched to befriend  Go ask the breast that teems with mournful sighs  Who wip'd the sorrows from Affliction's eyes  Go ask the wretch in want and sickness laid  Whose goodness brighten'd once Misfortune's shade  O snatch me hence to lone sequester'd scenes  To arching grottoes and embowering greens  Where scarce a ray can pierce the dusky shade  Where scarce a footstep marks the dewy glade  Where palehu'd Grief her secret dwelling keeps  Where the chill blood with lazy horror creeps  Where awful Silence spreads her noiseless wing  And Sorrow's harp may tune the dismal string  Or rather lead my steps to distant plains  Where closing earth enfolds her last remains  What time the moon displays her silver beam  And groves and floods reflect the milder gleam  When Contemplation broods with thought profound  And fairy visions haunt the sylvan ground  Lo Fancy now on airy pinions spread  With scenes ideal hovers o'er my head  I see I see more pleasing themes arise  What mystic shadows flit before my eyes  Imagination paints the sacred grove  The place devote to poesy and love  Here grateful poets hail the actors' name  And pay the rightful tribute to their fame  Around their tomb in generous sorrow mourn  And twine the laurels o'er the favour'd urn  Methinks I view the last sepulchral frame  That bears inscrib'd her much lamented name  See to my view the Drama's sons display'd  What laurell'd phantoms croud the awful shade  First of the choir immortal Shakespear stands  Whose searching eye all Nature's scene commands  Bright in his look celestial spirit blooms  And Genius o'er him waves his eagle plumes  Next tender Southern skill'd the soul to move  And gentle Rowe who tunes the breast to love  The witty Congreve near with sprightly mien  And easy Farquhar with his lighter scene  A numerous train of bards the shrine surround  In tragic strains and comic lore renown'd  See on the tomb yon pensive form appear  Heave the full sigh and drop the frequent tear  The garments loose her throbbing bosom show  Dispers'd in air her careless tresses flow  Round her pale brows a myrtle wreath is spread  A gloomy cypress nods above her head  See while her hand a solemn lyre sustains  Her trembling fingers wake the languid strains  Soft to the touch the vocal strings reply  And tune the notes to answer every sigh  She child of Grief at human misery weeps  At every death her dismal vigil keeps  But chief she mourns when Fate's relentless doom  Gives Wit and Beauty victims to the tomb  Her lays their merits and their loss proclaim  A mournful task and Elegy her name  Now bending o'er the pile she vents her moan  And pours these sorrows o'er the senseless stone  Ah lost for ever lost the breath that warm'd  The wit that ravish'd and the mien that charm'd  Here sleeps beneath the fairest of the fair  The Graces' darling and the Muses' care  Who once could fix a thousand gazers eyes  Now cold and lifeless unregarded lies  Who once the soul in bonds of love detain'd  Now lies alas in stronger bonds restrain'd  Pale Death has risled all her pleasing store  And Nature loaths a sorm so lov'd before  Is there a fair whose features point the dart  Charm the six'd eye and fascinate the heart  Behold what soon disarms the childish sting  And plucks the wanton plume from Cupid's wing  Then boast no longer Wit's fallacious store  The sweets of sprightly Converse boast no more  Those lips so fram'd to each persuasive art  No more shall touch the ear and win the heart  Let Beauty here her transient blessing weigh  Let humbled Wit her pitying tribute pay  Let Female Grace vouchsafe the kindly tear  Wit Grace and Beauty once were center'd here  Ye sacred Bards who tun'd the drama's lays  Here pay your incense of distinguish'd praise  She gave your scenes with every grace to shine  She gave new feeling to the nervous line  Her beauties well supply'd each tragic lore  And shew'd those charms your Muse but feign'd before  Here round her shrine your votive wreaths bestow  Around her shrine eternal greens shall grow  The listning groves shall learn her name to sing  And zephyrs wast it on their downy wing  Till every shade these doleful sounds return  And every gale in sullen dirges mourn  The mourner ends with sighs her hand she rears  And with her vesture dries the gushing tears  Behold each Bard the soft contagion feels  From every eye the trickling sorrow steals  See Nature's son lament her hapless doom  See Shakespear bending o'er his favourite's tomb  Each shadowy form declines his awful head  And scatters roses on the funeral bed  In slow procession round the shrine they move  And chant her praises thro' the tuneful grove  Farewel the glory of a wondering age  The second Oldfield of a sinking stage  Farewel the boast and envy of thy kind  A female softness and a manly mind  Long as the Muses can record thy praise  Thy fame shall last to far succeeding days  While wit survives thy name shall ever bloom  And wreaths unfading flourish round thy tomb  While thus I tune the plaintive notes in vain  For her whose worth demands a nobler strain  Lo to my thought some warning Genius cries  Attempt not swain beyond thy flight to rise  Shall thy weak skill attempt to raise our woes  Or paint a loss that every bosom knows  'Tis not thy lays can teach us tears to shed  What eye

by their mates sit and sing  And are danc'd by the breeze on each spray  When gently descending the rain in soft showers  With its moisture refreshes the ground  And the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers  Like rich gems beam a lustre around  When the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe  And the cuckow proclaims with his voice  That Nature marks this for the season to wooe  And for all that can love to rejoice  In a cottage at night may I spend all my time  In the fields and the meadows all day  With a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime  Young as April and blooming as May  When the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn  May my fairest and I sweetly wake  View the far distant hills which the sun beams adorn  Then arise and our cottage forsake  When the sun shines so warm that my charmer and I  May recline on the turf without fear  Let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy  While we breathe the first sweets of the year  Be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side  Bubble out and transparently flow  Creep gently along in meanders and glide  Thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below  While the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips  And the violets their sweetness impart  Let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips  The rich cordial that thrills to the heart  While the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate  Which the fowler has caught in his snares  May we think ourselves blest that it is not our fate  To endure such an absence as theirs  May I listen to all her soft tender sweet notes  When she sings and no sounds interfere  But the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats  Are at strife to be louder than her  When the daisies and cowslips and primroses blow  And checquer the meads and the lawns  May we see bounding there the swift lightfooted doe  And pursue with our eye the young fawns  When the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run  And the sirstlings are all at their play  And the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun  Let us then be as frolic as they  When I talk of my love should I chance to espy  That she seems to mistrust what I say  By a tear that is ready to fall from her eye  With my lips let me wipe it away  If we sit or we walk may I cast round my eyes  And let no single beauty escape  But see none to create so much love and surprize  As her eyes and her face and her shape  Thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves  And the meadows around us are mown  When the lass on the sweetsmelling haycock receives  What she afterwards blushes to own  When evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads  With the dew then no longer we'll roam  With my arm round her waist in a path thro' the meads  Let us hasten to find our way home  When the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings  Each one by the side of its mate  When a mist that arises a drowsiness brings  Upon all but the owl and the bat  When soft rest is requir'd and the stars lend their light  And all Nature lies quiet and still  When no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night  But at distance the clack of a mill  With peace for our pillow and free from all noise  So that voices in whispers are known  Let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys  That are mus'd on by lovers alone  SUMMER  BY THE SAME  WHERE the light cannot pierce in a grove of all trees  With my fair one as blooming as May  Undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze  Let me pass the hot noon of the day  When the sun less intense to the westward inclines  For the meadows the groves we'll forsake  And see the rays dance as inverted he shines  On the face of some river or lake  Where my fairest and I on its verge as we pass  For 'tis she that must still be my theme  Our two shadows may view on the watery glass  While the fish are at play in the stream  May the herds cease to lowe and the lambkins to bleat  When she sings me some amorous strain  All be silent and husht unless Echo repeat  The kind words and sweet sounds back again  And when we return to our cottage at night  Hand in hand as we sauntering stray  Let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light  Just direct us and chequer our way  Let the Nightingale warble its notes in our walk  As thus gently and slowly we move  And let no single thought be express'd in our talk  But of friendship improv'd into love  Thus enchanted each day with these rural delights  And secure from Ambition's alarms  Soft love and repose shall divide all our nights  And each morning shall rise with new charms  AUTUMN  BY THE SAME  THO' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find  What all must confess to be rare  A female still chearful and faithful and kind  The blessings of Autumn to share  Let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine  Overspread with its branches and shade  Whose clusters appear more transparent and fine  As its leaves are beginning to sade  When the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load  In our orchard surrounded with pales  In a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd  For a tart that in Winter regales  When the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn  Seem to hang on its surface like smoak  'Till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn  Within doors let us prattle and joke  But when we see clear all the hues of the leaves  And at work in the fields are all hands  Some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves  Let us carelesly stroll o'er the lands  How pleasing the sight of the toiling they make  To collect what kind Nature has sent  Heaven grant we may not of their labour partake  But oh give us their happy content  And sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook  Let us silently sit at our ease  And there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook  Struggles hard to procure its release  And now when the husbandman sings harvest home  And the corn's all got into the house  When the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come  To frolic and feast and carouse  When the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed  And are leaving the branches all bare  Either strew'd at the roots shrivell'd wither'd and dead  Or else blown to and fro in the air  When the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem  And the axletree's ready to break  While the waggoner whistles in stopping his team  And then claps the poor jades on the neck  In the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds  Or the fearful young covey beset  Which tho' skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds  Are becoming a prey to the net  Let's enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords  Still amus'd with these innocent sports  Nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords  With their grand entertainments in courts  In the evening when lovers are leaning on stiles  Deep engag'd in some amorous chat  And 'tis very well known by his grin and her smiles  What they both have a mind to be at  To our dwelling tho' homely wellpleas'd to repair  Let our mutual endearments revive  And let no single action or look but declare  How contented and happy we live  Should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul  Let soft music the phantoms remove  For 'tis harmony only has force to controul  And unite all the passions in love  With her eyes but half open her cap all awry  When the lass is preparing for bed  And the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by  Sometimes rouzes and scratches his head  In the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy and dark  And the labourers snore as they lie  Not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark  In the farm or the village hard by  At the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this  Ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids  Let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss  Which the sunshine and daylight forbids  WINTER  BY THE SAME  WHEN the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen  And the meadows their beauty have lost  When Nature's disrob'd of her mantle of green  And the streams are fast bound with the frost  While the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold  As bleak the winds northerly blow  And the innocent flocks run for warmth to the fold  With their fleeces besprinkled with snow  In the yard when the cattle are fodder'd with straw  And they send forth their breath like a steam  And the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw  Flakes of ice that she finds in the cream  When the sweet countrymaiden as fresh as a rose  As she carelessly trips often slides  And the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shews  All the charms that her modesty hides  When the lads and the lasses for company join'd  In a croud round the embers are met  Talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind  And of ghosts till they're all in a sweat  Heaven grant in this season it may be my lot  With the nymph whom I love and admire  While the icicles hang from the eves of my cot  I may thither in safety retire  Where in neatness and quietand free from surprize  We may live and no hardships endure  Nor feel any turbulent passions arise  But such as each other may cure  THE CURE OF SAUL A SACRED ODE  BY DR BROWN  " VENGEANCE arise from thy infernal bed  " And pour thy tempest on his guilty head"  Thus heaven's decree in thunder's sound  Shook the dark abyss profound  The unchain'd Furies come  Pale Melancholy stalks from hell  Th' abortive offspring of her womb  Despair and Anguish round her yell  By sleepless terror Saul possess'd  Deep feels the fiend within his tortur'd breast  Midnight spectres round him howl  Before his eyes  In troops they rise  And seas of horror overwhelm his soul  Haste to Jesse's son repair  He best can sweep the lyre  Wake the solemnsounding air  And lead the vocal choir  On every string softbreathing raptures dwell  To sooth the throbbings of the troubled breast  Whose magic voice can bid the tides of passion swell  Or lull the raging storm to rest  Sunk on his couch and loathing day  The heavenforsaken monarch lay  To the sad couch the shepherd now drew near  And while th' obedient choir stood round  Prepar'd to catch the soulcommanding sound  He dropp'd a generous tear  Thy pitying aid O God impart  For lo thy poison'd arrows drink his heart  The mighty song from chaos rose  Around his throne the formless atoms sleep  And drowzy Darkness broods upon the deep  Confusion wake  Bid the realms of Chaos shake  Rouse him from his dread repose  Hark loud Discord breaks her chain  The hostile atoms clash with deafning roar  Her hoarse voice thunders thro' the drear domain  And kindles every element to war  " Tumult cease  " Sink to peace  " Let there be light"th' Almighty said  And lo the radiant Sun  Flaming from his orient bed  His endless course begun  See the twinkling Pleiads rise  Thy star Orion reddens in the skies  While slow around the northern plain  Arcturus wheels his nightly wane  Thy glories too refulgent moon he sung  Thy mystic mazes and thy changeful ray  O fairest of the starry throng  Thy solemn orb of light  Guides the triumphant carr of Night  O'er silver clouds and sheds a softer day  Ye planets and each circling constellation  In songs harmonious tell your generation  Oh while yon radiant Seraph turns the spheres  And on the stedfast polestar stands sublime  Wheel your rounds  To heavenly sounds  And sooth his songenchanted ears  With your celestial chime  In dumb surprize the listning monarch lay  His woe suspended by sweet Music's sway  And awe struck with uplifted eye  Mus'd on the newborn wonders of the sky  Lead the soothing verse along  He feels he feels the power of song  Ocean hastens to his bed  The lab'ring mountain rears his rockencumber'd head  Down his steep and shaggy side  The torrent rolls his thundering tide  Then smooth and clear along the fertile plain  Winds his majestic waters to the distant main  Flocks and herds the hills adorn  The lark highsoaring hails the morn  And while along yon crimsonclouded steep  The slow sun steals into the golden deep  Hark the solemn Nightingale  Warbles to the woodland dale  See descending angels shower  Heaven's own bliss on Eden's bower  Peace on Nature's lap reposes  Pleasure strews her guiltless roses  Joys divine in circles move  Link'd with Innocence and Love  Hail happy Love with Innocence combin'd  All hail ye sinless parents of mankind  They paus'dthe monarch prostrate on his bed  Submissive bow'd his head  Ador'd the works of boundless power divine  Then anguishstruck he cry'd an smote his breast  Why why is peace the welcome guest  Of every heart but mine  Now let the solemn numbers flow  'Till he feel that guilt is woe  Heavenly harp in mournful strain  O'er yon weeping bower complain  What sounds of bitter pangs I hear  What lamentations wound mine ear  In vain devoted pair these tears ye shed  Peace with Innocence is fled  The messengers of Grace depart  Death glares and shakes the dreadful dart  Ah whither fly ye by yourselves abhorr'd  To shun that frowning cherub's fiery sword  Lo  Hapless hapless pair  Goaded by despair  Forlorn thro' desart climes they go  Wake my lyre can Pity sleep  When heaven is mov'd and angels weep  Flow ye melting numbers flow  Till he feel that guilt is woe  The king with pride and shame and anguish torn  Shot fury from his eyes and scorn  The glowing youth  Bold in truth  So still should Virtue guilty power engage  With brow undaunted met his rage  See his cheek kindles into generous fire  Stern he bends him o'er his lyre  And while the doom of guilt he sings  Shakes horror from the tortur'd strings  What sounds of terror and distress  Rend yon howling wilderness  The dreadful thunders sound  The forked lightnings flash along the ground  Why yawns that deep'ning gulph below  'Tis for heaven's rebellious foe  Fly ye sons of Israel fly  Who dwells in Korah's guilty tents must die  They sinkHave mercy LordTheir cries  In dreadful tumult rise  Hark from the deep their loud laments I hear  They lessen now and lessen on the ear  Now destruction's strife is o'er  The countless host  For ever lost  The gulph is clos'dTheir cries are heard no more  But oh my lyre what accents can relate  Sinful man's appointed sate  He comes he comes th' avenging God  Clouds and darkness round him roll  Tremble earth Ye mountains nod  He bows the skies and shakes the pole  The gloomy banners of his wrath unfurl'd  He calls the floods to drown a guilty world  " Ruin lift thy baleful head  " Rouze the guilty world from sleep  " Lead up thy billows from their cavern'd bed  " And burst the rocks that chain thee in the deep  Now th' impetuous torrents rise  The hoarseascending deluge roars  Down rush the cataracts from the skies  The swelling waves o'erwhelm the shores  Just O God is thy decree  Shall guilty man contend with thee  Lo Hate and Envy seaentomb'd  And Rage with Lust in ruin sleep  And scoffing Luxury is doom'd  To glut the vast and ravenous deep  In vain from Fate th' astonish'd remnant flies  " Shrink ye rocks Ye oceans rise"  The tottering cliffs no more the floods controul  Sea following sea ingulphs the ball  O'er the sunk hills the watry mountains roll  And wide Destruction swallows all  Now fiercer let th' impassion'd numbers glow  Swell the song ye mighty choir  Wing your dreadful darts with fire  Hear me monarchGuilt is woe  Thus while the frowning shepherd pour'd along  The deep impetuous torrent of his song  Saul stung by dire despair  Gnash'd his teeth and tore his hair  From his blood by horror chill'd  A cold and agonizing sweat distill'd  Then foaming with unutterable smart  He aim'd a dagger at his heart  His watchful train prevent the blow  And call each lenient balm to sooth his frantic woe  But pleas'd the shepherd now beheld  His pride by heaven's own terrors quell'd  Then bade his potent lyre controul  The mighty storm that rent his soul  Cease your cares the body's pain  A sweet relief may find  But gums and lenient balms are vain  To heal the wounded mind  Come fair Repentance from the skies  O sainted maid with upcast eyes  Descend in thy celestial shrowd  Vested in a weeping cloud  Holy guide descend and bring  Mercy from th' Eternal King  To his soul your beams impart  And whisper comfort to his heart  They come O King thine ear incline  Listen to their voice divine  Their voice shall every pang compose  To gentle sorrow sooth thy woes  Till each pure wish to heaven shall soar  And Peace return to part no more  Behold obedient to their great command  The lifted dagger quits his trembling hand  Smooth'd is his brow where sullen Care  And furrow'd Horror couch'd with fell Despair  No more his eyes with fury glow  But heavenly grief succeeds to hellborn woe  See the signs of grace appear  See the soft relenting tear  Trickling at sweet Mercy's call  Catch it angels ere it fall  And let the heartsent offering rise  Heaven's bestaccepted sacrifice  Yet yet againAh see the pang returns  Again with inward fire his heaving bosom burns  Now shepherd wake a mightier strain  Search the deep heartrending pain  Till the large floods of sorrow roll  And quench the tortures of his soul  Almighty Lord accept his pang sincere  Let heavenly hope dispel each dark temptation  And while he pours the penitential tear  O visit him with thy salvation  Stoop from heaven ye raptur'd throng  Sink ye swelling tides of song  For lo dissolv'd by Music's melting power  Celestial Sorrow rolls her plenteous shower  O'er his wan cheek the colours rise  And beams of comfort brighten in his eyes  Happy king thy woes are o'er  Thy God shall wound thy soul no more  The pitying Father of mankind  Meets the purereturning mind  No more shall black Despair afflict his soul  Each gentler sound ye shepherds now combine  Sweetly let the numbers roll  Sooth him into hope divine  Now lowly let the rustic measure glide  To quell the dark remains of selfconsuming Pride  Till Nature's homesprung blessings he confess  And own that calm content is happiness  Ye woods and lakes ye cliffs and mountains  Haunted grots and living fountains  Listen to your shepherd's lay  Whose artless carols close the day  Bounding kids around him throng  The steep rock echoes back his song  While all unseen to mortal eye  Sliding down the evening sky  Holy Peace tho' born above  Daughter of Innocence and Love  Quits her throne and mansion bright  Her crown of stars and robe of light  Serene in gentle smiles array'd  To dwell beneath his palmtree shade  Hail meek angel awful guest  Still pour thy radiance o'er my breast  Pride and Hate in courts may shine  The shepherd's calm and blameless tent is thine  Softly softly breathe your numbers  And wrap his weary'd soul in slumbers  Gentle Sleep becalm his breast  And close his eyes in healing rest  Descend celestial visions ye who wait  God's ministring powers at heaven's eternal gate  Ye who nightly vigils keep  And rule the silent realms of Sleep  Exalt the just to joys refin'd  And plunge in woe the guilty mind  DescendOh waft him to the skies  And open all heaven's glories to his eyes  Beyond yon starry roof by seraphs trod  Where Light's unclouded fountains blaze  Where choirs immortal hymn their God  Intranc'd in extasy of ceaseless praise  Angels heal his anguish  Your harps and voices join  His grief to bliss shall languish  When sooth'd by sounds divine  Behold with dawning joy each feature glows  See the blissful tear o'erflows  The fiend is fledLet music's rapture rise  Now Harmony thy every nerve employ  Shake the dome and pierce the skies  Wake him wake him into joy  What power can every Passion's throne controul  What power can boast the charm divine  To still the tempest of the soul  Celestial Harmony that mighty charm is thine  She heavenlyborn came down to visit earth  When from God's eternal throne  The beam of allcreative Wisdom shone  And spake fair Order into birth  At Wisdom's call she robed yon glittering skies  Attun'd the spheres and taught consenting orbs to rise  Angels wrapt in wonder stood  And saw that all was fair and all was good  'Twas then ye sons of God in bright array  Ye shouted o'er creation's day  Then kindling into joy  The morning stars together sung  And thro'the vast ethereal sky  Seraphic hymns and loud hosannahs rung  AN INSCRIPTION WRITTEN AT A FAVOURITE RETIREMENT IN MAY MDCCLVIII  BY THE SAME  WHAT tho' nor glittering turret rise  Nor Splendor gild these mild retreats  Yet Nature here in modest guise  Displays her unambitious sweets  Along each gentle swelling lawn  She strays with rustic garlands crown'd  And wakes the flowers at early dawn  To fling their bosom'd fragrance round  Here teach thy votary blameless guide  To trace thy step serene and free  To shun the toilsome heights of Pride  Thro' these calm scenes to follow thee  His silent walk do thou adorn  O'er these green slopes from tumult far  Whether he greet the blushing morn  Or welcome up you evening star  Intent while thro' these tufted bowers  Thy generous whispers charm his ear  To hail from heaven thy kindred powers  And meet fair Peace and Freedom here  Yet prompt to stay his country's fall  The stormy city's war he'll join  When thou and Truth and Freedom call  For Freedom's voice and Truth's are thine  AN ELEGY WRITTEN AMONG THE RUINS OF AN ABBEY  BY MR JERNINGHAM  WHERE sighs the zephyr to you lonely tree  A solemn grove its leafy mantle spread  Where bend you mouldering turrets o'er the sea  A venerable dome once rear'd its head  The solemn grove the venerable dome  Were erst frequented by a numerous train  Ev'n chaste as they who Dian's mountain roam  But not subjected to her gentle reign  Far other Goddess did this train obey  Far other temples other altars rais'd  Far other meaning breath'd their choral lay  Far other incense on their altars blaz'd  Veil'd Superstition wak'd her magic sound  Bad Albion's sons sorsake the splendid court  Forsake Amusement's variegated round  And to her sable standard here resort  Alas obsequious to her stern command  A sullenpensive brotherhood they came  Refus'd to trace the paths by Nature plann'd  And raz'd from Glory's page their ancient name  Nor these alone were found incloister'd here  Here also dwelt the simpleminded swain  Who wrapt in sloth dream'd out the lazy year  While Industry sat weeping on the plain  The many temples rising fair to view  Which towering Superstition call'd her own  With hand unerring radiant Truth o'erthrew  And snatch'd th' impostor from her tinsell'd throne  On yon dustlevell'd spire the crafty maid  With indignation brooding in her breast  Sits gloomilyHer votaries all are fled  Her lamps extinguish'd and her rites suppress'd  Within her hand a vacant string she holds  That once connected many a hallow'd bead  The blotted scroll the other hand unfolds  Contain'd the maxims of her slighted creed  Couch'd at her feet behold a mouldering shrine  Of various relics once the dread abode  Where runs the spider o'er his treacherous line  Where lurks the beetle and the loathso me toad  On Darkness' wing now sails the midnight hour  When for the grateful sound of choral prayer  The shrieking owl from you disparted tower  With notes of horror wakes her trembling ear  Of human grandeur mark the fleeting day  How frail each purpose and each wish how vain  The strongbuilt domes the cloister'd fanes decay  And ruin hovers round the desert scene  The path that leads to yonder shatter'd pile  Is now perplex'd with many a sordid brier  No crowd is seen within the sacred isle  The Sabbath mourns its longdeserted choir  The golden crozier blended with the dust  In horrid folds the serpent clasps around  The powerful image and the sainted bust  Desam'd unhallow'd press the weedy ground  Not distant far her gold encircled tower  Th' inviolable dame majestic rear'd  On whose dread altar breath'd some hidden power  By Terror guarded and by kings rever'd  To which asylum ev'n th' assassin came  His hand audacious still imbru'd with gore  The boon of full impunity to claim  While feeble Justice wept her baffled lore  So Truth at once dissolv'd the mental chain  And banish'd Error from th' enlighten'd shore  So clos'd at length the busyacted scene  The curtain dropp'd and Folly's mask was o'er  The gladsome Ceres rais'd her drooping head  While yellow harvests gilt the smiling plain  Beheld a youthful band around her spread  With sickles arm'd to reap the bearded grain  The warrior then beneath the trailing vest  The peaceful cessock or the drowsy cowl  No longer quench'd the flame within his breast  Or lull'd the purpose of his daring soul  But rush'd undaunted to the doubtful war  Pursu'd where Glory led the radiant way  Till Neptune rising on his coral car  Resign'd his watry world to Britain's sway  The virgin fair by venal guardians doom'd  By error prompted or subdu'd by force  No more in cloisters drear their days consum'd  Like flow'rets strew'd around the senseless corse  Triumphant Hymen hail'd the blissful hour  And saw a whiterob'd social train approach  For whom the Pleasures dress'd the happy bower  And scatter'd roses o'er the destin'd couch  Still other blessings from this change appear'd  No injur'd family did then behold  On loitering monks its native wealth conferr'd  Nor spacious altars cover'd with its gold  Full many trod that crooked path to Fame  Yet from her hand receiv'd no lasting meed  She from her annals rends their fading name  And gives to Infamy the worthless deed  But Vengeance some pursu'd with dire disgrace  Pursu'd beyond the circle of its sphere  Even to the cementery's dark recess  Nor spar'd them sleeping on the peaceful bier  Beside the spreading of that sombrous yew  Where yawns with hideous chasm the vaulted cave  Presenting to the fix'd astonish'd view  The profanation of a rifled grave  The largeendowing Rufus lay inurn'd  With many a sculputur'd image on his shrine  That smit with sorrow o'er his ashes mourn'd  The SisterGraces and the tuneful Nine  Imprinted on Tradition's storied leaf  Is found to this sepulchral spot confin'd  A terrorbreathing tale that wins belief  And oft repeated by the neighb'ring hind  From where yon mountain shades the dreary plain  Attracted by the scent of human blood  A troop of wolves voracious scour'd amain  And at this charnelvault requir'd their food  When horrid to relate they burst the tomb  And swift descending to the deepest shade  Uptore the shrowded tenant from its womb  And o'er the mangled corse relentless prey'd  The paly stars with dim reluctant light  Like tapers glimmer'd on their orgies foul  While gliding spectres scream'd with wild affright  Reecho'd loud by their tremendous howl  Ah what avail'd the solemnmoving hearse  The sable mantled cars the funeral throng  Grav'd on his monument the soothing verse  The priests the torches and the choral song  Misjudging wretch while thou with hand profuse  Thy treasures on this mansion didst entail  And pour down riches on the vow'd recluse  Thine orphan babes partook a scanty meal  Thy widow'd fair her cheek bedew'd with tears  Approach'd with suppliant knee the cloistergate  There ost disclos'd in vain her poignant cares  Returning still to weep her hapless fate  IL LATTE AN ELEGY  BY THE SAME  YE fair for whom the hands of Hymen weave  The nuptial wreath to deck your virgin brow  While pleasing pains the conscious bosom heave  And on the kindling cheeks the blushes glow  Whose spotless soul contains the better dower  Whose life unstain'd full many virtues vouch  For whom now Venus frames the fragrant bower  And scatters roses o'er th' expecting couch  To you I singAh ere the raptur'd youth  With trembling hand removes the jealous veil  Where long regardless of the vows of truth  Unsocial coyness stamp'd th' ungrateful soul  A low the Poet round your flowing hair  Cull'd from an humble vale a wreath to twine  To Beauty's altar with the Loves repair  And wake the lute beside that living shrine  That sacred shrine where female virtue glows  Where ev'n the Graces all their treasures bring  And where the lilly temper'd with the rose  Harmonious contrast breathes an Eden spring  That shrine where Nature with presaging aim  What time her friendly aid Lucina brings  The snowy nectar pours delightful stream  Where fluttering Cupids dip their purple wings  For you who bear a Mother's sacred name  Whose cradled offspring in lamenting strain  With artless eloquence asserts his claim  The boon of Nature but asserts in vain  Say why illustrious daughters of the great  Lives not the nursling at your tender breast  By you protected in his frail estate  By you attended and by you caress'd  To foreign hands alas can you resign  The parent's task the mother's pleasing care  To foreign hands the smiling babe consign  While Nature starts and Hymen sheds a tear  When 'mid the polish'd circle ye rejoice  Or roving join fantastic Pleasure's train  Unheard perchance the nursling lifts his voice  His tears unnotic'd and unsooth'd his pain  Ah what avails the coral crown'd with gold  In heedless infancy the title vain  The colours gay the purfled scarfs unfold  The splendid nursery and th' attendant train  Far better hadst thou first beheld the light  Beneath the rafter of some roof obscure  There in a mother's eye to read delight  And in her cradling arm repos'd secure  No wonder should Hygeia blissful Queen  Her wonted salutary gifts recall  While haggard Pain applies his dagger keen  And o'er the cradle Death unfolds his pall  The flowret ravish'd from its native air  And bid to flourish in a foreign vale  Does it not oft elude the planter's care  And breathe its dying odours on the gale  For you ye plighted fair when Hymen crowns  With tender offspring your unshaken love  Behold them not with Rigour's chilling frowns  Nor from your sight unfeelingly remove  Unsway'd by Fashion's dull unseemly jest  Still to the bosom let your infant cling  There banquet oft an everwelcome guest  Unblam'd inebriate at that healthful spring  With fond solicitude each pain asswage  Explain the look awake the ready smile  Unfeign'd attachment so shall you engage  To crown with gratitude maternal toil  So shall your daughters in affliction's day  When o'er your form the gloom of age shall spread  With lenient converse chase the hours away  And soothe with Duty's hand the widow'd bed  Approach compassionate the voice of Grief  And whisper patience to the closing ear  From Comfort's chalice minister relief  And in the potion drop a filial tear  So shall your sons when beauty is no more  When fades the languid lustre in your eye  When Flattery shuns her dulcet notes to pour  The want of beauty and of praise supply  Ev'n from the wreathe that decks the warrior's brow  Some chosen leaves your peaceful walks shall strew  And ev'n the flowers on classic ground that blow  Shall all unfold their choicest sweets for you  When to th' embattled host the trumpet blows  While at the call fair Albion's gallant train  Dare to the field their triplenumber'd foes  And chase them speeding o'er the frighten'd plain  The mother kindles at the glorious thought  And to her son's renown adjoins her name  For at the nurturing breast the hero caught  The love of virtue and the love of fame  Or in the senate when Britannia's cause  With generous themes inspires the glowing mind  While listening Freedom grateful looks applause  Pale Slavery drops her chain and sculks behind  With conscious joy the tender parent fraught  Still to her son's renown adjoins her name  For at the nurturing breast the patriot caught  The love of virtue and the love of same  THE TRANSFORMATION OF LYCON AND EUPHORMIUS  BY WILLIAM MELMOTH ESQ  DEEM not ye plaintive crew that suffer wrong  Ne thou O man who deal'st the tort misween  The equal gods who heaven's skymansions throng  Though viewless to the eyne they distant sheen  Spectators reckless of our actions been  Turning the volumes of grave sages old  Where auncient saws in fable may be seen  This truth I fond in paynim tale enroll'd  Which for ensample drad my muse shall here unfold  What time Arcadia's flowret vallies fam'd  Pelasgus first of monarchs old obey'd  There wonn'd a wight and Lycon was he nam'd  Unaw'd by conscience of no gods afraid  Ne justice rul'd his heart ne mercy sway'd  Some held him kin to that abhorred race  Which heaven's high towers with mad emprize assay'd  And some his cruel lynage did ytrace  From fell Erynnis join'd in Pluto's dire embrace  But he perdy far other tale did feign  And claim'd alliaunce with the Sisters nine  And deem'd himself what deems not pride so vain  The peerless paragon of wit divine  Vaunting that every foe should rue its tine  Right doughty wight yet sooth withouten smart  All powerless fell the losel's shafts malign  'Tis Vertue's arm to wield Wit's heavenly dart  Point its keen barb with force and send it to the heart  One only impe he had Pastora hight  Whose sweet amenaunce pleas'd each shepherd's eye▪  Yet pleas'd she not base Lycon's evil spright  Tho blame in her not Malice moten spy  Clear without spot as summer's cloudless sky  Hence poets feign'd Lycean Pan array'd  In Lycon's form enflam'd with passion high  Deceiv'd her mother in the covert glade  And from the stoln embrace ysprong the heavenly maid  Thus fabling they mean while the damsel fair  A shepherd youth remark'd as o'er the plain  She deffly pac'd elong so debonair  Seem'd she as one of Dian's chosen train  Full many a fond excuse he knew to feign  In sweet converse to while with her the day  'Till love unwares his heedless heart did gain  Nor dempt he simple wight no mortal may  The blinded god once harbour'd when he list foresay  Now much he meditates if yet to speak  And now resolves his passion to conceal  But sure quoth he my seely heart will break  If aye I smother what I aye must feel  At length by hope embolden'd to reveal  The labouring secret dropped from his tong  Whiles frequent singults check'd his faltring tale  In modest wise her head Pastora hong  For never maid more chaste inspired shepherd's song  What needs me to recount in long detail  The tender parley which these lemans held  How oft he vowed his love her ne'er should fail  How oft the stream from forth her eyne outwell'd  Doubting if constancy yet ever dwell'd  In heart of youthful wight suffice to know  Each rising doubt he in her bosome quell'd  So parted they more blithsome both I trow  For rankling love conceal'd me seems is deadly woe  Eftsoons to Lycon swift the youth did fare  Lagg'd ever youth when Cupid urg'd his way

 It chanc'd as once with serious ken  He view'd from thence the ways of men  He saw and pity touch'd his breast  The world by three foul fiends possest  Pale Discord there and Folly vain  With haggard Vice upheld their reign  Then forth he sent his summons high  And call'd a senate of the sky  Round as the winged orders prest  Jove thus his sacred mind exprest  " Say which of all this shining train

zeal arose  The triple tyrants to oppose  That instant from the realms of day  With generous speed they took their way  To Britain's isle direct their car  And enter'd with the evening star  Beside the road a mansion stood  Defended by a circling wood  Hither disguis'd their steps they bend  In hopes perchance to find a friend  Nor vain their hope for records say  Worth ne'er from thence was

amorous youths around thee bow  Nor flattering verse conveys the faithless vow  To graver notes will Sappho's soul attend  And ere she hears the lover hear the friend  Let maids less bless'd employ their meaner arts  To reign proud tyrants o'er unnumber'd hearts  May Sappho learn for nobler triumphs born  Those little conquests of her sex to scorn  To form thy bosom to each generous deed  To plant thy mind with every useful seed  Be these thy arts nor spare the grateful toil  Where Nature's hand has bless'd the happy soil  So shalt thou know with pleasing skill to blend  The lovely mistress and instructive friend  So shalt thou know when unrelenting Time  Shall spoil those charms yet opening to their prime  To ease the loss of Beauty's transient flower  While reason keeps what rapture gave before  And oh while Wit fair dawning spreads its ray  Serenely rising to a glorious day  To hail the growing lustre oft be mine  Thou early favourite of the sacred Nine  And shall the Muse with blameless boast pretend  In Youth's gay bloom that Sappho call'd me friend  That urg'd by me she shunn'd the dangerous way  Where heedless maids in endless error stray  That scorning soon her sex's idler art  Fair Praise inspir'd and Virtue warm'd her heart  That fond to reach the distant paths of Fame  I taught her infant genius where to aim  Thus when the feather'd choir first tempt the sky  And all unskill'd their feeble pinions try  Th' experienc'd sire prescribes th' adventurous height  Guides the young wing and pleas'd attends the flight  VERSES WRITTEN IN LONDON ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING  EARLY the sun his radiant axle guides  Sloping his steep course with the Pleiades  On every fragant briar the flowret blooms  And the wild woodlark chaunts his early song  In heedless carol to the smiling Hours  Young Maia's festive train their wavy dance  She jocund leads and from her horn profuse  Pours roses violets woodbines eglantine  Fair Flora's dower what time the youthful Spring  Clasp'd her allblushing in a secret bower  Thou the mild offspring of their warm embrace  Oh lovely May and these thine heritage  Which bounteous thou with an unsparing hand  Scatterest to all tho' chief thou lov'st to deck  The village Phaebe's brow and fairer far  Is thy adorning than the sunny glow  Of eastern ruby ill assorted grace  That decks not but deforms the faded cheek  Of the wan courtierFar more raptur'd greets  Fancy's sond ear where'er she musing roves  Thy minstrelsy untutor'd than the trill  And languid descant of Italian art  Yet fings the woodlark and the hawthorn blooms  Unheard the song the fragrance unperceiv'd  By me tho' not among the sons of men  There lives who listens with more raptur'd ear  Or feels more lively Nature's varied boon  For tho' confined in the city walls  To dwell with busy Care and with him watch  The call of Interest is my lot affix'd  Far happier seems to me the peasant's life  Who treads the furrow labouring yet his mind  Vacant of thought can muse of what around  Strikes his rapt eye with beauty or his ear  With pleasing song than if a golden mine  Disclos'd its boundless treasures but condemn'd  My carking thought to watch the gilded mischief  And cunningly devise t' increase the store  Bereav'd of every pleasure Nature gives  Each plain but heartfelt rapture what is wealth  In artful mazes we but toil for bliss  True Pleasure dwells not in the arched roof  She fings no carol to the midnight ball  The loaded board and Bacchus' flustering draughts  In vain are tryed for ah she dwells not there  She dwells not with such rude illmanner'd mirth  But seeks with her mild sister Chearfulness  The russet plain there prompts the virgin's song  Breathes the brisk carol from the cottage reed  Strikes the quick tabor glad with echoing pulse  And animates the village holiday  Nor then alone but when his honest labour  Calls the good swain she early joins his step  For the mild radiance of the opening dawn  Gives to her sight the wideextended view  Of hill and dale hoar forest flowering heath  Rich harvest verdant meadow where the stream  Rolls far its plenteous wave and all around  To Pleasure's ear most grateful thousand birds  Lark linnet thrush and thou of all the grove  The sweetest songster witching Philomel  Art rising to hymn out thy morning song  Thou too at eve when all his labour o'er  He at the furrow's end unyokes the steer  And seeks with weary step his rest at home  Dost with thy tranquil warble sooth his soul  Best prelude to the peace his cottage gives  There at the door his numerous offspring watch  Their sire's return and eager run to tell  The tyding of his coming while his dame  Plys her glad evening care to deck the board  With food uncater'd by the baleful hand  Of Luxury and fittest to refresh  His toilworn spirit and her smiling welcome  Gives its due relish to the simple fare  What are to this the proud luxurious feasts  The City's boast where distant colonies  Of East and Western worlds must be explor'd  To strike the sickly palate's feeble sense  With faint delight Oh what are all our joys  Ev'n those of monarchs to the thousand beauties  That strike the rapt soul of the rudest hind  Can Art's best mimicry their form express  Can rich Loraine mix up the glowing tint  Bright as Aurora Can he form a shade  To strike the fancy with a gloom so solemn  As every thicket copse or secret grove  At twilight hour affords Can savage Rosa  With aught so wildly noble fill the mind  As where the ancient oak in the wood's depth  Has shed his leafy honours and around  The woodman with fell axe has lower'd the pride  Of many a tall tree he deserted stands  A barren trunk while rude winds howl around  And dreary torrents lash his naked limbs  Mean time the rifting thunder dreadful roars  The livid lightnings flash and elements  Conjoin'd pour out their wrath as if to rend  The lone defenceless aged feeble oak  Such scenes awake Imagination's powers  To sacred thought such Rosa cannot paint  'Tis his alone to show the shatter'd trunk  The winds keen howl the thunder's aweful sound  The dreary rain these mock the pencil's power  Can aught of artful music sooth the soul  To so serene a temper as the flight  Of songsters in the grove or can thy strain  Tho' there Enchantment strike the magic chord  Oh matchless Purcell with so wild a charm  Transport the mind as when at dusk of eve  From the hoar battlement the lone owl's cry  Pierces the awful silence and the fall'n  And timeworn hollow towers convey the sound  To the near wood where in the devious path  Retired Fancy wanders on her ear  The faint sound murmurs strait the distant low  Of unyok'd heifer strait the cuckow's note  She hears while oft the roving Zephyr's tread  Rustling alarms her and the measur'd step  Of the slow steer who brushes thro' the thicket  To seek his food beats duly regular  As on he wanders thro' the opening bower  He sees the pale moon rising clouds on clouds  Pil'd mountainous awhile obstruct her beam  Till labouring thence she lifts her silver brow  And pours her full ray on the ivy'd steeple  And hark its bell now tolls the minute knell  And thro' the churchway path the surplic'd priest  Walks slowly forward while the snowy pall  Covering the relicks of some love lorn virgin  Passes with aweful pace along the glade  Wrapt harmonist what tho' thy studied chord  Can sound the slow knell echo to the note  The lone owl utters breathe the heifer's low  And mark the funeral step with pausing cadence  And music can no more where is the tower  O'erhung withivy seen by the pale moon  Whose faint beam glimmers on the snowy pall  Where are the rocky clouds from whence she breaks  Yet do not these does not the rustling breeze  And the slowtreading heifer add delight  Do not accordant senses join to fill  The musing mind with calm and holy rapture  And can the city by the utmost force  Of mimic art with labour'd imitation  So soothe the soul or give such mild delight  Ye gay and sportive votaries of Joy  Forgive the thoughtless Muse for she has led me  To talk of pleasing horror and the bliss  Which melancholy gives ye cannot form  Amid the circling follies which urge on  Your laughing hours perhaps ye cannot form  A notion of these joys and with a taunt  Of high contempt despise the wild enthusiasm  Yet on the welltrod stage have ye not seen  Your Roscius fired by the natural bard  Immortal Shakespear wander the bleak heath  A poor and outcast king nor blame the winds  Whose keen tooth seiz'd his age nor chide the elements  For their unkindness while the ruffling storm  Tore the proud garments from his shivering trunk  And the fierce lightnings fir'd his maddening brain  Have you not then felt horror Would ye not  Change your rich pomp for Edgar's naked hovel  And be the poor king's hostHave ye not wish'd  To range with Rosaline the forest wild  Or live beneath the shelter of some oak  With melancholy Jaques Tell me why then  Ye look'd on wealth and greatness with a scorn  Why but because the Muse with native strength  Pour'd truth on Fancy's eye and yet the Muse  Can only boast in the most warm description  A faint resemblance nor has she such force  To strike as Nature has Alas her voice  But wakes remembrance of our absent bliss  And when she sings of incensebreathing Spring  She wafts no odours to the longing sense  But only prompts our sigh that we must dwell  Confin'd in the full city distant far  From every scene of rural innocence  Whose woods whose shades whose storms or funerals  Ev'n raise a sense of pleasure What can then  The brighter views what can the happy hour  That gives the blushing bride to the true arms  Of faithful Damon Thenot pleas'd revives  To former youth and gayest of the day  Provokes the village mirth and from his soul  Enjoys the spousal of his boy who scarce  O'ercome with rapture can himself conduct  His festival and but for busy Thenot  Each due right were neglected and the guests  Unbidden by the tabor's sprightly sound  To seek the green and in the jocund dance  Each maiden with her youth breathe sport and joy  Save the still happier pair their greater bliss  Fills the whole breast nor leaves a vacant place  For lighter mirth Unnotic'd speaks the pipe  They hear no sound but the endearing voice  Of mutual love they do not mark the joy  In every face around for their attention  Fix'd on each other watches every glance  Diffused by the lovely languid eye  Well may all else be unperceiv'd for who  Observes bright Hesper dart his pointed ray  When riding high mild Cynthia pours serene  Her steady beam Oh tell me when compar'd  To these true raptures what's the shadowy pomp  And artful splendour when the golden shackles  Fetter two venal souls by interest call'd  To prostitute the everhallow'd rites  Of holy HymenOn the village plain  Nought joins but mutual love no sordid motive  Promotes unnatural union but the flame  That first united glows throughout their life  A steady fire whose unabating light  Gilds Youth with rapture and with fostering warmth  Chears drooping Age who smiling sees his offspring  Step forth to claim the joys he celebrates  With annual hospitality what time  The circling year brings round the happy day  That shower'd down blessings on him when it gave  To his fond vow the willing Sylvia's charms  Then blooming young now hoary but her heart  Unchang'd by time for still the same desire  To add to every joy or fondly soothe  Each woe he feels reigns unabated there  His social roof receives each welcome guest  His open heart diffuses round his pleasure  And each plain neighbour with unfeigning tongue  Congratulates his bliss Who would not leave  For these sincere delights the pageant pomp  The rich array the courtly formal speech  Unutter'd by the heart the birthday wish  Of venal hirelings who for interest croud  The glittering levee Happier Reason deems  View'd in each light the simple village life  Than all that courtiers wish or kings bestow  Kings cannot give a boon of so rich price  As are thy smiles O lovely Health and thou  Shunning the tumult to the rural green  Retirest There not built by mortal hand  Stands on the southern slope of the fresh hill  Thy temple from whose roof the eglantine  And vagrant woodbine hang and at the porch  Sits thy good priestess Ease administring  To Exercise who up the gentle slope  By moderate footing moves the holy cup  Of Temperance nymph of the crystal spring  That dwells beneath thy altar and from thence  Warbling with gentle lapse joins the full stream  That winding wild delays its silver course  In the rich mead whose bank the peasant oft  Approaches to allay his thirst and quaffs  The simple beverage from the limpid fount  Bright virgin thee of all the Powers who range  The rural plain I woo with constant vow  Most ardent Deign around my temples bind  Thy fragrant wreath and deck my purpled cheek  With thy rich glow Then undisturb'd the mind  Musing pursues its holy meditation  And rapt in trance can trace a thousand gifts  Shower'd by the gracious hand of Nature's King  To deck the various field The wondering eye  Roams o'er the fair creation then to heaven  Unbidden soars for the full soul imprest  With holy transport there directs its view  From whence its blessings flow and the rapt voice  Accordant hymns the grateful song of praise  The rapid gusts of passion which or pride  Or folly or the thousand varying forms  Of courtly affectation ever raise  Here all subside and the composed breast  Expands with love and to its utmost power  Diffuses blessings to mankind nor fears  Ingratitude should check or pride should spurn  The offer'd bounties of the generous heart  Bless'd be the day and doubly bless'd the hour  When my Fidele with unfeigned vow  Gave her fond hand and own'd her constant love  Tho' since that hour already thrice the sun  From every sign has seen our growing bliss  And tho' thy smile of unaffected love  Adds joy to every joy and charms to ease  The brow of Care tho' thou art all that heaven  Could give in woman tenderness and truth  And all my heart e'er wish'd when warmest Fancy  Form'd the fond future view of houshold bliss  Yet happier still perhaps our lot had been  Hadst thou beneath the rural thatch receiv'd  My faithful vow and we had never heard  Of town or city life a Marian thou  And rustic Corin I Then on the plain  Contented we had pass'd Life's little day  While Youth with sprightly beam illum'd her hours  They would move on with joy and when at noon  Firm Manhood call'd us forth to till the soil  And with our labouring hand direct the plough  We would be ready nor refuse the task  Due tribute to the public till at eve  Our vigour lost when Age came creeping on  We would unyoke our heifers and retire  To welcome ease our best skill then employ'd  At our own home attentive there to thatch  The chinks which Time had made and to root up  Each foul weed that deform'd our little plot  This business over calm we should attend  Th' approaching hour of our eternal rest  And when it came borne to our peaceful grave  By the plain villager what tho' no tomb  Of sculptur'd marble call'd the passing eye  To read our story yet the cottage tear  Should on our ashes fall and the good heart  O'erflow sincerely for a neighbour lost  Upon our bier the virgin troop would hang  Freshwoven chaplets of the sweetest flowers  Green turf should deck our grave and every year  In springtime would some friendly hand with care  Bind the fresh briar around to guard the place  From the rude insult of the careless step  And faithful Memory to late time record  We were the happiest pair of human kind  WOODSTOCK AN ELEGY  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLIX  AH me what is this mortal life I cry'd  What changes croud the page of flitting Time  What dire reverse of Fate have numbers try'd  What youth what beauty wither'd in the prime  Inexorable Destiny pursues  And levels in the chace with rapid wing    Pity in vain or Mirth or Merit sues  Equally vain the beggar and the king  Ah what is Fame the idol of the great  No solid Pleasure can she e'er bestow  If just to Worth that justice comes too late  Prompt is her malice but her mercy slow  Thus on the winding Isis' willowed bank  The varying scenes of Fortune I deplore  Wasting in fruitless sighs the evening dank  Tears adding water to the river's store  A gloomy mansion open to the view  Disclosing horror heighten'd by the shade  Where round the nodding walls the mournful yew  Points to the vault where Rosamond was laid  Where with her birds of night haggard and foul  In sullen fellowship together dwell  The bat ambiguous and illomen'd owl  Screaming to nighted swains a dreadful knell  Intent I gaz'd till Terror ruling sight  Rear'd a pale spectre from the yawning tomb  A faint delusion of the murky night  Begot and bred in Fancy's fruitful womb  Semblance of virgin elegance and grace  The mimic shape in every part adorn'd  But wan and languid seem'd the beauteous face  Which Elen envy'd and which Henry mourn'd  Now gently gliding o'er the hallow'd ground  Close by my side the phantom made a stand  Piercing the nightstill'd air An awful sound  And claim'd attention with uplifted hand  " I once was blest with Love's deluding joy  " I also felt the worst extreme of hate  " And can no length of time she cry'd destroy  " Remembrance of my love and of my fate  " O had Oblivion in her peaceful cell  " Shrouded from every eye my mouldering dust  " That on the chissel'd stone no verse might tell  " My crime how great my punishment how just  " But Woodstock's blooming bowers still remain  " The scenes to me of pleasure and of woe  " And Godstow's walls perpetuate the stain  " My name reproaching whilst my grave they shew  " O Woodstock fated long to be the seat  " Of all the charms that Wit and Beauty boast  " The hero's guerdon and his soft retreat  " Yielding content in fields and senates lost  " Thy glories now are levell'd low in earth  " No longer Beauty doth thy bowers adorn  " No more thy woods resound the voice of Mirth  " The laurel from thy victor brow is torn  " But thou whose bosom foreign sorrow heaves  " Whose eyes can stream for anguish not thine own  " Whose heart the whiterob'd fugitive receives  " When forc'd by awful Rigour from her throne  " The scourge of vice the good man's destiny  " The wreck of fortune and the waste of years  " The miseries thou mournest thou shalt see  " Sad consolation granted to thy tears"  Now on the summit of a cloudbuilt height  Methought I stood and from an opening glade  With faultering ray gleam'd forth a magic light  And round the plain in lambent circles play'd  Sudden the ground with inbred motion shook  A solemn murmur rustled thro' the trees  And on the pebbled shore the surging brook  Dash'd angry waves unconscious of a breeze▪  Daedalian mystery from the parted soil  A labyrinth 'rose to sounds of melting note  A moment's labour mocking all the toil  Of nations old and monarchs long forgot  High overarch'd in Summer's gayest weed  Meandering alleys form the wonderous maze  And puzzle most when best they seem to lead  The untaught foot that in their precincts strays  Deep in a vale impervious to all tread  Save by a flowerhid path a grotto stood  And ancient oaks their foliage round it spread  O'ershading with their tops the neighbouring wood  And Nature sporting with a lavish hand  This little spot in gay profusion grac'd  With every wanton variation plann'd  Luxuriant Fancy yielding but to Taste  Here on the brink of a pellucid stream  Circling in eddies o'er its mossgrown bed  Where ever and anon a quivering beam  Piercing the covert on the surface play'd  A Beauty lay surpassing all the train  Of virgin Delia or Idalia's queen  Or what of dryads poets sweetly feign  On Ida or thessalian Oeta seen  And by her side a form imperial lay  With roses and with myrtle garlands crown'd  The wither'd laurel cast in scorn away  The pomp of war in Lydian measures drown'd  The little Loves that flutter'd on the boughs  In grateful bondage did their limbs entwine  And strove to join them closer than their vows  With woodbine sweet and twisted eglantine  But weak all bonds when those of Beauty fail  The monarch sated left the flowery bed  Nor griev'd to see the maid his loss bewail  Nor mingled parting tears with those she shed  Now swift advancing to the guilty bower  With frantic step the injur'd queen drew nigh  And arm'd for vengeance seiz'd the fatal hour  When all things slept but rage and jealousy  Each eager hand a deadly weapon fill'd  A pointed dagger and a poison'd bowl  My ebbing blood her mad demeanor chill'd  And anguish unallay'd possess'd my soul  Ah stop inhuman with a faultering tongue  And inarticulate voice as in a dream  I cry'd and strait the rattling thunder rung  And livid lightnings in the welkin gleam  No more the mazy grove or bower appear'd  But all around a waste and barren plain  The scatter'd trees of leaves and branches bar'd  And blanch'd by srowning winds and beating rain  And Murder shrieking hideous wander'd there  And ruthless Envy and relentless Hate  With snaky locks and shrivell'd bosoms bare  Whilst lurking felons on their motions wait  And soon the landscape shifting like a cloud  To less'ning distance bore the hellish crew  Now twang in fainter sounds their yellings loud  Now vanish'd quite a milder scene I view  Of chequer'd light and shade a sober dawn  Faint thro' a lingering vapour did disclose  A hamlet seated on an open lawn  And from each roof the pillar'd smoke arose  For now with freqent challenge had the cock  His rivals menacing awak'd the swain  Now in the pen impatient bleats the flock  And ruddy streaks the horizon distain  The crouching dog the moon no longer bays  But stretch'd supine upon the social hearth  He lies rejoicing in the crackling blaze  Whilst slaunting sunbeams dry the moisten'd earth  Whilst to the strain of rural minstrelsy  A band forth issuing to a neighbouring hill  Welcom'd the morn with decent jollity  And all the air their youthful carrols fill  With unskill'd hands a simple crown they wove  Of vervain and the neversading bay  And rais'd a throne within a rude alcove  To grace the parent of the British lay  Old Chaucer who in rough unequal verse  Sung quaint allusion and sacetious tale  And ever as his jests he would rehearse  Loud peals of laughter echo'd thro' the vale  And eager gap'd the rustic listening throng  And still their joy and laughter they renew  And warlike barons soften'd by the song  From loud alarms to mute attention drew  But shortliv'd pleasure soon to sorrow chang'd  For melody a sigh for mirth a tear  And now the swains in solemn order rang'd  Surround the bard extended on his bier  What tho' succeeding poets as their sire  Revere his memory and approve his wit  Tho' Spenser's elegance and Dryden's fire  His name to ages far remote transmit  His tuneless numbers hardly now survive  As

ascend  Trees half obscuring columns intervene  And real boughs with sculptur'd fruitage blend  And arched windows shine with torches clear  Soothing the wanderer A delusive home  And busy crouds of ministers appear  Decking with jocund haste a festive room  And now of sprightly youths and damsels gay  A wanton bevy at the board was set  And all intent they seem'd on amorous play  For kindling glances kindling glances met  Their volant fingers o'er the chorded lyre  With modulating touch the artists ply  Pursuing still to animate desire  Strains that in thrilling undulations die  And every cheek with deep suffusion glow'd  Denoting thought inflam'd and troubled breast  And passion in seducing sighs avow'd  Mutual yet still by decency represt  But soon excess to madding riot led  Ensuing meaning jest and licence bold  Till comely Order from the banquet fled  Asham'd the lustful orgies to behold  A youth exalted high above the rest  In bad preeminence conspicuous shone  And blind submission to his lewd behest  Unrivall'd lewdness from them all had won  And deeply was he skill'd in wanton lore  With sertile thought suggesting every art  To make impurer fires impure before

Dread consequence of being great  Wild Heptarchy began her reign  Till overaw'd she yields her scepter to the Dane  Awhile in ignorance she lay  The pagan worlds obscur'd her day  The Goths a wild

 How all her valour sunk and boasting heroes fell  Fam'd Dettingen still reeks with blood  Where like a God great Brunswick stood  Triumphant Fame on silken wing  Rode smiling on before the king  Like Mars he shook the pointed spear  The Gauls retreat and all their battle shrunk with fear  Tremendous Death and Horror stride  Close by intrepid William's side  William he bled and soldiers griev'd  " Revenge they cry the wound receiv'd"  Bright Venus mourn'd her favourite care  And quick she bid her nymphs the healing drugs prepare  The Cyprian goddess stood confest  As when Aeneas' wound she

That dare their country's laws oppose  Their lives and fortunes not their own  But given in mercy from the throne  Do they ungrateful men presume  To act the scheme of France or play the part of Rome  Discord and Horror stalk along  With pale Rebellion in the throng  Bellona stains the purple field  And Mars displays his brazen shield  William his brothergod appears  To curb the traitorous war and

Albion dreads no foreign foe  Her fleets but ask propitious gales  But ask and Conquest swells her sails  France strikes the flag our colours near  Whitens her golden flowers and shrinks with coward fear  Britons united by their laws  Can never swerve from Freedom's cause  Blest in great George we guard his reign  And Gallic insolence disdain  Well may we guard th' imperial throne  Which every Briton's voice and Virtue made his own  Calm as a god behold him there  Express his soft paternal care  Mercy sits mourning on his face  To see severer Law take place  And whilst rebellious subjects die  Sighs swell his royal breast and tears his pitying eye  Such Brunswick is who rules our land  Such is the monarch we defend  Blessing and bless'd a mutual good  By Britons only understood  Late may he England's scepter wield  Protect our laws at home and guard us in the field  A long illustrious race of kings  From Frederick and Augusta springs  This Brunswick views with joyous eye  And

Stretch'd on my weary bed I wakeful lay  Sad troublous thoughts like hornets stung my breast  And brush'd the dews of balmy sleep away  Ah what avails I cry'd with painful toil  By Virtue's stedfast star the bark to guide  Far from  Spenser's Faery Queen Book II  Acrasia's wilywandering isle  Where ease and pleasure the frail heart divide  If Life's short voyage undistinguish'd tends  To darkness

drown reflection in the mantling bowl  'Gainst wind and tide let Stoic dulness sail  Be mine the calmest sea and Pleasure's briskest gale  Pensive I mus'd 'till rose the blushing Morn  And spread her saffron mantle o'er the skies  When pitying Morpheus shook his opiate horn  And slumbrous humours drown'd my weary'd eyes  Yet Fancy still awake to sooth my pain  Sweet scenes of joy in liveliest hue pourtray'd  She call'd forth all her bright ideal train  And pleasing truths in mystic dreams convey'd  Oh fail me not thou fair enchanting Power  At Sorrow's grim approach and Care's distressful hour  Born thro' the yielding air methought I flew  To some more blissful clime sequester'd far  From this frail world that just appear'd to view  Like the faint glimmering of a distant star  Deep in the sea's encircling wave 'twas plac'd  As gems in silver hoary Ocean smil'd  Chear'd with the pleasing sight    Pind  and from his breast  Sent his sweet children breezes fresh and mild  No clouds nor darkness veil'd the chearful scene  Nor wintry blasts deform'd the ground's eternal green  Lo to the West a large and spacious plain  Where meet in concert wood and hill and dale  Brighter than all

rills of dulcet wine  And honey'd streams revolve their milky stores  Fresh bleeding myrrh and cassia shed perfume  Ananas swell with sweets and wild pomegranates bloom  Fast by a fount  Called by the

Immortal joys that never know to pall  " Come then ah come thy weary limbs recline  " On silken beds of roses sweetly strow'd  " Where to thy touch compliant bows the vine  " All faint and labouring

From cold Potosi's mines retire  From rugged rocks and darkling caves  When scarce the panting lungs respire  To citronshades they take their pensive way  Where bath'd in odorous winds their listless

more  Quencht is the generous heat the rapturous throbs are o'er  II  'Twas thou O nymph that ledd'st along  The fair Dione's wanton choir  While to thy blithest softest song  Ten thousand Cupids strung the lyre  Aloft in air the cherubs play'd  What time in Cypria's myrtleshade  Young Adonis slumbering lay  On a bed of blushing flowers  Call'd to life by early May  And the rosybosomed Hours  The Queen of love beheld her darling boy  In amorous mood she nestled to his side  And thus to melt his frozen breast to joy  Her wanton art she gaylysmiling try'd  II  From the muskrose wet with dew  And the lilly's opening bell  From fresh eglantine she drew  Sweets of aromatic smell  Part of that honey next she took  Which  Theoer  Cupid too adventurous stole  When stung his throbbing hand he shook  And felt the anguish to his soul  His mother laught to hear the elf complain  Yet still she pity'd and reliev'd his pain  She drest the wound with balm of sovereign might  And bath'd him in the well of dear delight  Ah who would fear to be so bath'd in bliss  More agonizing smart and deeper wounds than this  III  Her magic zone she next unbound  And wav'd it in the air around  Then cull'd from everfrolic smiles  That live in Beauty's dimpled cheek  Such sweetness as the heart beguiles  And turns the mighty strong to weak  To these ambrosial dew she join'd  And o'er the flame of warm desire  Fann'd by soft sighs Love's gentlest wind  Dissolv'd and made the charm entire  O'er her moist lips that blush'd with heavenly red  The Graces' friendly hand the blest ingredients spread  III  Adonis wak'dhe saw the fair  And felt unusual tumults rise  His bosom heav'd with amorous care  And humid languor veil'd his eyes  Driven by some strong impulsive power  He sought the most sequester'd bower  Where diffus'd on Venus' breast  First he felt extatic bliss  First her balmy lips he prest  And devour'd the newmade Kiss  But O my Muse thy tattling tongue restrain  Her sacred rites what mortal dares to tell  She crowns the silent leads the blabbing swain  To doubts desires and fears the feverish lover's hell  III  Change then sweetest nymph of nine  Change the song and fraught with pleasures  String anew thy silver twine  To the softest Lydian measures  My Cynthia calls whose natal hour  Th' assistant Graces saw and smil'd  Then deign'd this Cyprian charm to pour  With lavish bounty o'er the child  Sithence where'er the Siren moves along  In pleasing wonder chain'd is every tongue  Love's soft effusion dims the aching eyes  Love's subtlest flame thro' every artery flies  Our trembling limbs th' unequal pulse betray  We gaze in transport lostthen faint and die away  ODE ON DESPAIR  BY THE SAME  SAVE meWhat means you grisly shade  Her stony eyeballs staring wide  In soul and tatter'd patches clad  With dirt and gore and venom dy'd  A burning brand she whirls around  And stamps and raves and tears the ground  And madly rends her clotted hair  While thro' her canker'd breast are seen  Myriads of serpents bred within  The cursed spawn of self consuming Care  'Twas thus  Vide Musaeum    O poor enamour'd maid  The Stygian fiend approach'd the seagirt tower  What time in sad misfortune's evil hour  The faithless lamp Love's cynosure decay'd  " And why" the ghastly phantom cries  " Wilt thou deluded Hero wait  " Leander's wish'd return forbid by Fate  " See floating on his watery bier he lies  " Pale are his cheeks where Love was wont to play  " And clos'd those radiant eyes that late outshone the day"  The woeforeboding voice she heard  And wishing trembling pray'd for morn  When lo the bleeding corse appear'd  By savage rocks all rudely torn  Where were ye Nymphs O tell me where  Daughters of Nereus fresh and fair  And why sweet silverfooted Queen  Would'st thou not leave thy coral cave  And sooth the rough remorseless wave  Ere Death had seiz'd thy best thy boldest swain  With haggard eyes allstreaming blood  Distracted Hero saw her lover slain  And thrice indignant view'd the guilty main  And thrice accus'd each merciless watry God  Aye me in vainFor "see she cry'd  " My dear Leander's beckoning shade  " And canst thou live O lost O wretched maid  " Shall envious Fate so fond a pair divide  " Forbid it Love"Then headlong from the tower  Deep in the ruthless flood she plung'd to rise no more  With scenes of woe O cursed Power  How are thy greedy eyes regal'd  How did thy heart exult of yore  When heaven's vindictive rod assail'd  See the account which is given by Thucydides of the plague at Athens  The Queen of artsWith giantstride  Contagion stalks and lo the bride  The virginbride unpity'd dies  Claspt to his daughter's throbbing breast  The father breathes his soul to rest  And sorrowing sons compose the widow'd mother's eyes  Scar'd by the Daemon's spotted hand  The eagle scream'd the famish'd vulture fled  The hungry wolf forsook th' unburied dead  And pale diseases shivering left the land  What cries and piercing shrieks resound  Thro' every street at every fane  Yet ah they weep they weary heaven in vain  Death and Distraction stare on all around  The wretched few whom poisonous Pestilence spares  Of moody madness die and heartdistracting fears  These are thy deeds O fell Despair  Thou tyrant of the tortur'd soul  According to the table of Cebes  is the Sister of    Sister of paleey'd Grief and Care  At whose command impetuous roll  Passion's rough tides and swelling high  Burst thro' each dear and sacred tye  And every pleasing thought o'erwhelm  Anon the crazy bark is born  Of winds and waves and rocks the scorn  For Reason shrinks appall'd and trembling quits the helm  O fly thou first born child of hell  To some far distant dreary doleful plain  Where starting Fear and agonizing Pain  And black Remorse and sullen Sorrows dwell  Where arm'd with poison racks and death  Stern Horror rears his Gorgon head  And writhing dreadful on the iron bed  The purple Furies grind their canker'd teeth  While percht on stubs of trees the shriekowl sings  And screaming deadly hoarse nightravens flap their wings  Thither embost with varied woe  Misfortune's pallid slave retires  Hark hark he ravesThy tablet shew  Charg'd with damn'd ghosts and sulphurous fires  Oh mercy heavenUpstarting stands  His grisly hair his nerveless hands  Shake o'er his face the curdled blood  From his swoln heart with tidings flies  " Give me another horse" he cries  " Oh bring the poison'd bowl let loose Life's crimson flood"  Sad sacred wretchThou Power divine  Whose godlike word from chaos dark and dread  Bad Discord fly and Light sweetsmiling spread  Her orient wing controul this breast of mine  And still when gloomy thoughts prevail  Oh short and partial be their sway  And beam'd from thee let Pleasure's gladsome ray  The mournful progeny of Grief dispel  So shall the checquer'd scenes of Life delight  As morning brighter peers preceded still by night  ODE TO THE MUSE  BY THE SAME  I  YET once more sweetest Queen of Song  Thy humble suppliant lead along  Thro' Fancy's flowery plains  Oh bear me to th' ideal grove  Where hand in hand the Graces rove  And sooth me with seraphic strains  'Tis thine harmonious maid to cull  Delicious balm to heal our cares  'Tis thine to take the prison'd soul  And lap it in Elysian airs  While quick as thought at thy divine command  The realms of Grace and Harmony expand  I  And lo before my ravish'd eyes  The visionary scenes arise  I hear the tender lute complain  While Sappho breathes her amorous pain  O guard me from such fierce desires  Thou God of Raptures God of Fires  I hear Anacreon's honey'd tongue  To Love and Wine repeat the song  His flight sublime the Theban swan prepares  And louder music wakes the wondering spheres  I  But hark how sweet the numbers swell  While Homer waves his soulenchanting wand  Entranc'd the listening Passions stand  Charm'd with the magic of his shell  Whether to arms his trump resounds  The heart with martial ardor bounds  Or sprightly themes his hand employ  Instant we catch the spreading joy  Or when in notes majestic deep and slow  He bids the solemn streams of Sorrow flow  Amaz'd we hear the sadlypleasing strain  While tender anguish steals thro' every vein  II  Father of Verse whose eagle flight  Fatigues the gazer's aching sight  And strains th' aspiring mind  Teach me thy wonderous heights to view  With trembling wings thy steps pursue  And leave the lessening world behind  Fond foolish wishCan human eyes  The rapid arrow's track descry  Can gross Mortality arise  And spring beyond the vaulted sky  Lost is the momentary path and bound  By cumbrous chains we creep along the ground  II  Yet some there are with power endow'd  To soar above the groveling croud  By thee fair Fancy rapturous maid  By thee O sweet enthusiast led  Sublime beyond the milky way  With strong seraphic plumes they stray  Or pierce within the sacred shade  Where Nature's plastic forms are laid  Then strike with daring hand the magic strings  And warm to life a new creation springs  II  Hail chosen few whose happier birth  The Muse beheld and bad your due feet climb  Fame's slippery hill and paths sublime  Untrod by vulgar sons of earth  When Virtue droops all sick and pale  In bleak Misfortune's desart vale  'Tis yours to steal away her care  And softly sooth the pensive fair  'Tis yours to cull from Fancy's fairy stores  The brightest gems and sweetestbreathing flowers  Then bind with Daedal art such wreaths divine  As bloom secure on Truth's immortal shrine  III  Haste thenfor soft Etesian gales  Supply the  Pind  pilot's welcome sails  And waft him o'er the main  And gentle showers the daughters fair  Of pregnant clouds and balmy air  Rejoice the faint and thirsty plain  O haste your sweetest numbers shed  Fraught with the genial dew of praise  On Glory's favourite sons who tread  Unweary'd Danger's thorny maze  Who tear fresh laurels from War's ghastly brow  Or steer the stedfast bark tho' tides of Faction flow  III  But O ye delegates of Jove  Sent from the starry realms above  To guard the clime with dragon eyes  When all the Muse's treasures rise  Should Gothic Ignorance invade  With lawless foot the virgin shade  And too incontinent presume  Rashly to pluck the golden bloom  Wide wave the flaming sword and send O send  Your brightest shafts to quell the Stygian fiend  III  With holy dread ye guardians of her store  Fulfil your charge not too profuse of praise  Embalm with her immortal lays  The carrion corps of Pride or Power  Let Dulness her vain favours shed  On smiling Folly's kindred head  Or Vice in tinsel trappings drest  Promote the wretch who flatters best  Disdain the crewand in some distant grove  To Worth afflicted friendless raise your voice  So shall the Muse your honest songs approve  And deathless Fame reward your uncorrupted choice  THE WISH AN ELEGY  TO URANIA  BY THOMAS BLACKLOCK D D  LET others travel with incessant pain  The wealth of earth and ocean to secure  Then with fond hopes caress the precious bane  In grandeur abject and in affluence poor  But soon too soon in Fancy's timid eyes  Wild waves shall roll and conflagrations spread  While bright in arms and of gigantic size  The fearform'd robber haunts the thorny bed  Let me in dreadless poverty retir'd  The real joys of life unenvied share  Favour'd by Love and by the Muse inspir'd  I'll yield to Wealth its jealousy and care  On rising ground the prospect to command  Unting'd with smoke where vernal breezes blow  In rural neatness let my cottage stand  Here wave a wood and there a river flow  Oft from the neighbouring hills and pastures round  Let sheep with tender bleat salute my ear  Nor fox insidious haunt the guiltless ground  Nor man pursue the trade of murder near  Far hence kind heaven expel the savage train  Inur'd to blood and eager to destroy  Who pointed steel with recent slaughter stain  And place in groans and death their cruel joy  Ye Powers of social life and tender song  To you devoted shall my fields remain  Here undisturb'd the peaceful day prolong  Nor own a smart but Love's delightful pain  For you my trees shall wave their leafy shade  For you my gardens tinge the lenient air  For you be Autumn's blushing gifts display'd  And all that Nature yields of sweet or fair  But O if plaints which love and grief inspire  In heavenly breasts could e'er compassion find  Grant me ah grant my heart's supreme desire  And teach my dear Urania to be kind  For her black Sadness clouds my brightest day  For her in tears the midnight vigils roll  For her cold horrors melt my powers away  And chill the living vigour of my soul  Beneath her scorn each youthful ardor dies  Its joys its wishes and its hopes expire  In vain the fields of Science tempt my eyes  In vain for me the Muses string the lyre  O let her oft my humble dwelling grace  Humble no more if there she deign to shine  For heaven unlimited by time or place  Still waits on godlike worth and charms divine  Amid the cooling fragrance of the morn  How sweet with her through lonely fields to stray  Her charms the loveliest landskip shall adorn  And add new glories to the rising day  With her all Nature shines in heighten'd bloom  The silver stream in sweeter music flows  Odours more rich the fanning gales perfume  And deeper tinctures paint the spreading rose  With her the shades of night their horrors lose  Its deepest silence charms if she be by  Her voice the music of the dawn renews  Its lambent radiance sparkles in her eye  How sweet with her in Wisdom's calm recess  To brighten soft desire with wit refin'd  Kind Nature's laws with sacred Ashley trace  And view the fairest features of the mind  Or borne on Milton's flight as heaven sublime  View its full blaze in open prospect glow  Bless the first pair in Eden's happy clime  Or drop the human tear for endless woe  And when in virtue and in peace grown old  No arts the languid lamp of life restore  Her let me grasp with hands convuls'd and cold  Till every nerve relax'd can hold no more  Long long on her my dying eyes suspend  Till the last beam shall vibrate on my sight  Then soar where only greater joys attend  And bear her image to eternal light  Fond man ah whither would thy fancy rove  'Tis thine to languish in unpitied smart  'Tis thine alas eternal scorn to prove  Nor feel one gleam of comfort warm thy heart  But if my fair this cruel law impose  Pleas'd to her will I all my soul resign  To walk beneath the burden of my woes  Or sink in death nor at my fate repine  Yet when with woes unmingled and sincere  To Earth's cold womb in silence I descend  Let her to grace my obsequies appear  And with the weeping throng her sorrows blend  Ah no be all her hours with pleasure crown'd  And all her soul from every anguish free  Should my sad fate that gentle bosom wound  The joys of heaven would be no joys to me  AN HYMN TO FORTITUDE  BY THE SAME  NIGHT brooding o'er her mute domain  In aweful silence wraps her reign  Clouds press on clouds and as they rise  Condense to solid gloom the skies  Portentous thro' the foggy air  To wake the Daemon of Despair  The raven hoarse and boding owl  To Hecate curst anthems howl  Intent with execrable art  To burn the veins and tear the heart  The witch unhallowed bones to raise  Through funeral vaults and charnels strays  Calls the damn'd shade from every cell  And adds new labours to their hell  And shield me heaven what hollow sound  Like Fate's dread knell runs echoing round  The bell strikes one that magic hour  When rising fiends exert their power  And now sure now some cause unblest  Breathes more than horror thro' my breast  How deep the breeze how dim the light  What spectres swim before my sight  My frozen limbs pale Terror chains  And in wild eddies wheels my brains  My icy blood forgets to roll  And Death e'en seems to seize my soul  What sacred power what healing art  Shall bid my soul herself assert  Shall rouze th' immortal active flame  And teach her whence her being came  O Fortitude divinely bright  O Virtue's child and man's delight  Descend an amicable guest  And with thy firmness steel my breast  Descend propitious to my lays  And while my lyre resounds thy praise  With energy divinely strong  Exalt my soul and warm my song  When raving in eternal pains  And loaded with ten thousand chains  Vice deep in Phlegeton yet lay  Nor with her visage blasted day  No fear to guiltless man was known  For God and Virtue reign'd alone  But when from native flames and night  The cursed monster wing'd her flight  Pale Fear among her hideous train  Chas'd sweet Contentment from her reign  Plac'd Death and Hell before each eye  And wrapt in mist the golden sky  Banish'd from day each dear delight  And shook with conscious starts the night  When from th' imperial seats on high  The Lord of Nature turn'd his eye  To view the state of things below  Still blest to make his creatures so  From earth he saw Astraea fly  And seek her mansions in the sky  Peace crown'd with olives left her throne  And white rob'd Innocence was gone  While Vice reveal'd in open day  Sole tyrant rul'd with iron sway  And Virtue veil'd her weeping charms  And fled for refuge to his arms  Her altars scorn'd her shrines defac'd  Whom thus th' Essential Good address'd  " Thou whom my soul adores alone  Effulgent sharer of my throne  Fair Empress of Eternity  Who uncreated reign'st like me  Whom I who sole and boundless sway  With pleasure infinite obey  To yon diurnal scenes below  Who feel their folly in their woe  Again propitious turn thy flight  Again oppose yon tyrant's might  To earth thy cloudless charms disclose  Revive thy friends and blast thy foes  Thy triumphs man shall raptur'd see  Act suffer live and die for thee  But since all crimes their hell contain  Since all must feel who merit pain  Let Fortitude thy steps attend  And be like thee to man a friend  To urge him on the arduous road  That leads to virtue bliss and God  To blunt the sting of every grief  And be to all a near relief"  He said and she with smiles divine  Which made all heaven more brightly shine  To earth return'd with all her train  And brought the golden age again  Since erring mortals unconstrain'd  The God that warms their breast profan'd  She guardian of their joys no more  Could only leave them and deplore  They now the easy prey of Pain  Curst in their wish their choice obtain  Till arm'd with heaven and fate she came  Her destin'd honours to reclaim  Vice and her slaves beheld her flight  And fled like birds obscene from light  Back to th' abode of plagues return  To sin and smart blaspheme and burn  Thou Goddess since with sacred aid  Hast every grief and pain allay'd  To joy converted every smart  And plac'd a heaven in every heart  By thee we act by thee sustain  Thou sacred antidote of Pain  At thy great nod the  Alluding to the history of Hannibal  Alps subside  Reluctant rivers turn their tide  With all thy force Alcides warm'd  His hand against Oppression arm'd  By thee his mighty nerves were strung  By thee his strength for ever young  And whilst on brutal force he press'd  His vigour with his foes increas'd  By thee like Jove's almighty hand  Ambition's havock to withstand  Timoleon having long in vain importuned his brother to resign the despotism of Corinth at last restored the liberty of the people by stabbing him Vid Plut  Timoleon rose the scourge of fate  And hurl'd a tyrant from his state  The brother in his soul subdu'd  And warm'd the poniard in his blood  A soul by so much virtue fir'd  Not Greece alone but heaven admir'd  But in these dregs of human kind  These days to guilt and fear resign'd  How rare such views the heart elate  To brave the last extremes of fate  Like heaven's almighty power serene  With fix'd regard to view the scene  When Nature quakes beneath the storm  And Horror wears its direst form  Tho' future worlds are now descry'd  Though Paul has writ and Jesus dy'd  Dispell'd the dark infernal shade  And all the heaven of heavens display'd  Curst with unnumber'd groundless fears  How pale yon shivering wretch appears  For him the daylight shines in vain  For him the fields no joys contain  Nature's whole charms to him are lost  No more the woods their Music boast  No more the meads their vernal bloom  No more the gales their rich perfume  Impending mists deform the sky  And beauty withers in his eye  In hopes his terror to elude  By day he mingles with the croud  Yet finds his soul to fears a prey  In busy crouds and open day  If night his lonely walk surprize  What horrid visions round him rise  That blasted oak which meets his way  Shown by the meteor's sudden ray  The midnight murderer's known retreat  Felt heaven's avengeful bolt of late  The clashing chain the groan profound  Loud from yon ruin'd tower resound  And now the spot he seems to tread  Where some selfslaughter'd corse was laid  He feels fixt Earth beneath him bend  Deep murmurs from her caves ascend  Till all his soul by fancy sway'd  Sees lurid phantoms croud the shade  While shrouded manes palely stare  And beckoning wish to breathe their care  Thus real woes from false he bears  And feels the death the hell he fears  O thou whose spirit warms my song  With energy divinely strong  Erect his soul confirm his breast  And let him know the sweets of rest  Till every human pain and care  All that may be and all that are  But false imagin'd ills appear  Beneath our hope our grief or fear  And if I right invoke thy aid  By thee be all my woes allay'd  With scorn instruct me to defy  Imposing fear and lawless joy  To struggle thro' this scene of strife  The pains of death the pangs of life  With constant brow to meet my fate  And meet still more Euanthe's hate  And when some swain her charms shall claim  Who feels not half my generous flame  Whose cares her angelvoice beguiles  On whom she bends her heavenly smiles  For whom she weeps for whom she glows  On whom her treasur'd soul bestows  When perfect mutual joy they share  Ah joy enhanc'd by my despair  Mix beings in each flaming kiss  And blest still rise to higher bliss  Then then exert my utmost power  And teach me being to endure  Lest reason from the helm should start  And lawless fury rule my heart  Lest madness all my soul subdue  To ask her Maker What dost thou  Yet couldst thou in that dreadful hour  On my rack'd soul all Lethe pour  Or fan me with the gelid breeze  That chains in ice th' indignant seas  Or wrap my heart in tensold steel  I still am man and still must feel  ODE AGAINST ILLNATURE  BY CHRISTOPHER SMART M A  I

unshaven wood  Within an hoary mossgrown cell  He lays his careless limbs without reserve  And strikes impetuous strikes each querulous nerve  Of his resounding shell  In all the woods in all the plains  Around a lively stillness reigns  The deer approach the secret scene  And weave their way thro' labyrinths green  While Philomela learns the lay  And answers from the neighbouring bay  But Medway melancholy mute  Gently on his urn reclines  And allattentive to the lute  In uncomplaining anguish pines  The crystal waters weep away  And bear the tidings to the sea  Neptune in the

ditties sing  And hop in buxom youth from spray to spray  Proud as Sir Paridel of rich array  The little wantons that draw Venus team  Chirp amorous thro' the grove in beavies gay  And he who erst gain'd Leda's fond esteem  Now sails on Thamis' tide the glory of the stream  Proud as the Turkish soldan chaunticleer  Sees with delight his numerous race around  He grants fresh favours to each female near  For love as well as cherisaunce renown'd  The waddling dame that did the Gauls confound  Her tawny sons doth lead to rivers cold  While Juno's  Darling  dearling with majestic bound  To charm his  Lover  leman doth his train unfold  That glows with vivid green that flames with burning gold  The balmy cowslip gilds the smiling plain  The virgin snowdrop boasts her silver hue  An hundred tints the gaudy daisy stain  And the meek violet in amis blue  Creeps low to earth and hides from public view  But the rank nettle rears her crest on high  So ribaulds loose their front unblushing shew  While modest merit doth neglected lie  And pines in lonely shade unseen of vulgar eye  See all around the gallless  Doves  culvers bill  Mean while the nightingale's becalming lays  Mix with the plaintive music of the rill  The which in various  Circles or windings  gyres the meadow  Bathes  bays  Behold the welkin bursts into a blaze  Fast by the car of light the nimble Hours  In songs of triumph hail his genial rays  And as they  Go  wend to Thetis cooling bowers  They bound along the sky and strew the heavens with flowers  And now the human bosom melts to love  The raptur'd Bard awakes his skilful lyre  By running streams or in the laurel grove  He tunes to amorous notes his sounding wire  All all his harmony and all desire  The happy numbers charm the blooming maid  Her blushing cheeks pronounce her heart on fire  She now consents then shuns th' embowering shade  With faint reluctance yields desirous yet afraid  Now rustic Cuddy with untutor'd throat  Tho' much admir'd I ween of nymph and swain  By various songs would various ends promote  Seeks he to prove that woman's vows are vain  He Bateman's fortune tells a baleful strain  And if to honour Britain he be led  He sings a 'prentice bold in londs profane  Who all unarm'd did strike two lions dead  Tore forth their savage hearts and did a princess wed  But hark the bagpipe summons to the green  The jocund bagpipe that awaketh sport  The blithesome lasses as the morning sheen  Around the flowercrown'd maypole quick resort  The Gods of pleasure here have fix'd their court  Quick on the wing the flying moment seize  Nor build up ample schemes for life is short  Short as the whisper of the passing breeze  Yet ah in vain I preachmine heart is ill at ease  SUMMER  BENEATH yon  Knotty  snubby oak's extended shade  Safe let me hide me from the eye of day  Nor shall the dogstar this retreat invade  As thro' the heavens he speeds his burning way  The sultry lion rages for his prey  Ah Phoebus quench thy wild destroying fire  Each flower each shrub doth sink beneath thy ray  Save the fresh laurel that shall ne'er expire  The leaves that crown a bard may brave celestial ire  Or shall I hie to mine own hermitage  Round which the wanton vine her arms doth wind  There may I lonely turn the sacred page  Improve my reason and amend my mind  Here 'gainst Life's ills a remedy I find  An hundred flowers emboss the verdant ground  A little brook doth my sweet cottage bind  Its waters yield a melancholy sound  And sooth to study deep or lull to sleep profound  The playful insect hopping in the grass  Doth tire the hearer with his sonnet shrill  The poolsprung gnat on sounding wing doth pass  And on the  Starting flyingout  ramping steed doth suck his fill  Ah me can little creatures work such ill  The patient cow doth to eschew the heat  Her body steep within the neighbouring rill  And while the lambs in fainter voices bleat  Their mothers hang their head in doleful plight I weet  Careless  Rechless of seasons see the lusty swains  Along the meadow spread the tawny hay  The maidens too undaunted seek the plains  Ne fear to show their faces to the ray  But all the honest badge of toil display  See how they mould the haycock's rising head  While wanton Colin full of amorous play  Down throweth Susan who doth shriek for dread  Fear notthou canst be hurt upon so soft a bed  At length the sun doth hasten to repose  And all the vault of heaven is streak'd with light  In flamy gold the ruddy welkin glows  And for the noonday heat our pains doth  Requite  quite  For all is calm serene and passing bright  Favonius gentle skims along the grove  And sheds sweet odours from his pennons light  The little bat in giddy orbs doth rove  And loud the screechowl shrieks to rouse her blueey'd love  Menalcas came to taste the evening gale  His cheeks impurpled with the rose of youth  He won each damsel with his piteous tale  They thought they listen'd to the words of truth  Yet their belief did work them muchel  Sorrow  ruth  His oaths were light as gossimer or air  His tongue was poisonous as an aspic's tooth  Ah cease to promise joy and give despair  'Tis brave to smite

Well pleas'd he wanders o'er the fallow lea  And views each rural object with delight  Ne'er be my lot the brawling courts to see  Who trusts to lawyer's tongue doth much  Judges ill  misween perdy

babbling music of her tongue  The lonely woodcock seeks the splashy glen  Each mountain head with fleecy snow is hung  The snipe and duck enjoy the moorish fen  Like  Hermits  Eremites they live and shun the sight of men  The  Stupified  wareless sheep no longer bite the mead  No more the ploughboy turns the stubborn ground  At the full crib the horned labourers feed  Their nostrils cast black clouds of smoak around  A squalid coat doth the lean steed surround  The wily fox doth prowl abroad for prey  Rechless of snares or of th' avenging hound  And trusty Lightfoot now no longer gay  Sleeps at the kitchen hearth his cheerless hours away  Where erst the boat and slowly moving barge  Did with delight cut thro' the dimpling plain  Now wanton boys and men do roam at large  The rivergods quit their usurp'd domain  And of the wrong at Neptune's court complain  There mote you see mild Avon crown'd with flowers  And milky Wey withouten spot or stain  There the fair stream that washes Hampton's bowers  And Isis who with pride beholds her learned towers  Intent on sport the ever jocund throng  Quit their warm cots and for the game prepare  Behold the restless football whirls along  Now near the earth now mounted high in air  Thus often men in life's wild lottery fare  Who quit true bliss to grasp an empty toy  Our honest swains for wealth nor titles care  But lusty health in exercise employ  The distant village hears the rude tumultuous joy  The careful hedger looks the fields around  To see what labour may his skill demand  He mends the fence repairs the sinking mound  Or in long drains he cuts the lower land  That shall henceforth all sudden floods withstand  Mean while at home his dame with silver hair  Doth sit incircled by a goodly band  Of lovely maids who various works prepare  All chaste as Jove's wise child as Cupid's mother fair  She them discourses not of fashions nice  Nor of the trilling notes which eunuchs sing  Allurements vain that prompt the soul to vice  Ne tells she them of Kesar or of king  Too great the subject for so mean a ring  Her lessons teach to swell the capon's size  To make the hen a numerous offspring bring  Or how the wayward mother to chastise  When from her vetchy nest the weetless vagrant hies  When glistering spangles deck the robe of night  And all their kine in pens avoid the cold  The buxom troops still

rude winds those lips of softness kiss  Will Eurus stern the charms of beauty spare  No he will hurt my rosyfeatur'd fair  If aught so bright dares rugged carl invade  Too tender thou such rough

Pleasure and laughterloving Health  Whitemantled Peace with olivewand  Young Joy and diamondscepter'd Wealth  Blithe Plenty with her loaded horn  With Science brightey'd as the morn  In Britain which for ages past  Has been thy choicest darling care  Who mad'st her wise and strong and fair  May thy best blessings ever last  For thee the pining prisoner mourns  Depriv'd of food of mirth of light  For thee pale slaves to galleys chain'd  That ply tough oars from morn to night  Thee the proud Sultan's beauteous train  By eunuchs guarded weep in vain  Tearing the roses from their locks  And Guinea's captive kings lament  By Christian lords to labour sent  Whipt like the dull unfeeling ox  Inspir'd by thee deaf to fond Nature's cries  Stern Brutus when Rome's Genius loudly spoke  Gave her the matchless filial sacrifice  Nor turn'd nor trembled at the deathful stroke  And he of later age but equal fame  Dar'd stab the tyrant tho' he lov'd the friend  How burnt the  Leonidas  Spartan with warm patriotflame  In thy great cause his valorous life to end  How burst Gustavus from the Swedish mine  Like light from chaos dark eternally to shine  When heaven to all thy joys bestows  And graves upon our heartsBe free  Shall coward man those joys resign  And dare reverse this great decree  Submit him to some idolking  Some selfish passionguided thing  Abhorring man by man abhorr'd  Around whose throne stands trembling Doubt  Whose jealous eyes still rowl about  And Murder with his reeking sword  Where trampling Tyranny with Fate  And black Revenge gigantic goes  Hark how the dying infants shriek  How hopeless Age is sunk in woes  Fly mortals from that fated land  Tho' rivers roll o'er golden sand  Tho' birds in shades of Cassia sing  Harvests and fruits spontaneous rise  No storms disturb the smiling skies  And each sost breeze rich odours bring  Britannia watchremember peerless Rome  Her hightower'd head dash'd meanly to the ground  Remember Freedom's guardian Grecia's doom  Whom weeping the despotic Turk has bound  May ne'er thy oakcrown'd hills rich meads and downs  Fame Virtue Courage Poverty forgot  Thy peaceful villages and bufy towns  Be doom'd some deathdispensing tyrant's lot  On deep foundations may thy freedom stand  Long as the surge shall lash thy seaencircled land  ODE TO HEALTH  WRITTEN ON A RECOVERY FROM THE SMALLPOX  BY THE SAME  O Whether with laborious clowns  In meads and woods thou lov'st to dwell  In noisy merchantcrouded towns  Or in the temperate Brachman's cell  Who from the meads of Ganges' fruitful flood  Wet with sweet dews collects his flowery food  In Bath or in Montpellier's plains  Or rich Bermudas' balmy isle  Or the cold North whose furclad swains  Ne'er saw the purple Autumn smile  Who over Alps of snow and desarts drear  By twinkling starlight drive the flying deer  O lovely queen of mirth and ease  Whom absent beauty banquets wine  Wit music pomp nor science please  And kings on ivory couches pine  Nature's kind nurse to whom by gracious heaven  To sooth the pangs of toilsome life 'tis given  To aid a languid wretch repair  Let paleey'd Grief thy presence fly  The restless demon gloomy Care  And meagre Melancholy die  Drive to some lonely rock the giant Pain  And bind him howling with a triple chain  O come restore my aking sight  Yet let me not on Laura gaze  Soon must I quit that dear delight  O'erpower'd by Beauty's piercing rays  Support my feeble feet and largely shed  The oil of gladness on my fainting head  How nearly had my spirit past  Till stopt by Metcalf's skilful hand  To Death's dark regions wide and wast  And the black river's mournful strand  Or to those vales of joy and meadows blest  Where sages heroes patriots poets rest  Where Maro and Musaeus sit  Listening to Milton's loftier song  With sacred silent wonder smit  While monarch of the tuneful throng  Homer in rapture throws his trumpet down  And to the Briton gives his amaranthine crown  ODE TO SUPERSTITION  BY THE SAME  HENCE to some convent's gloomy isles  Where chearful daylight never smiles  Tyrant from Albion haste to slavish Rome  There by dim tapers livid light  At the still solemn hours of night  In pensive musings walk o'er many a sounding tomb  Thy clanking chains thy crimson steel  Thy venom'd darts and barbarous wheel  Malignant fiend bear from this isle away  Nor dare in Error's fetters bind  One active freeborn British mind  That strongly strives to spring indignant from thy sway  Thou bad'st grim Moloch's frowning priest  Snatch screaming infants from the breast  Regardless of the frantic mother's woes  Thou led'st the ruthless sons of Spain  To wondering India's golden plain  From deluges of blood where tenfold harvests rose  But lo how swiftly art thou fled  When Reason lifts his radiant head  When his resounding awful voice they hear  Blind Ignorance thy doating sire  Thy daughter trembling Fear retire  And all thy ghastly train of terrors disappear  So by the Magi hail'd from far  When Phoebus mounts his early car  The shrieking ghosts to their dark charnels slock  The sullgorg'd wolves retreat no more  The prowling lionesses roar  But hasten with their prey to some deep cavern'd rock  Hail then ye friends of Reason hail  Ye foes to Mystery's odious veil  To Truth's high temple guide my steps aright  Where Clarke and Wollaston reside  With Locke and Newton by their side  While Plato sits above enthron'd in endless light  ODE TO A GENTLEMAN UPON HIS TRAVELS THROUGH ITALY  BY THE SAME  WHILE I with fond officious care  For you my chorded shell prepare  And not unmindful frame an humble lay  Where shall this verse my Cynthio find  What scene of art now charms your mind  Say on what sacred spot of Roman ground you stray  Perhaps you cull each valley's bloom  To strew o'er Virgil's laurell'd tomb  Whence oft at midnight echoing voices sound  For at that hour of silence there  The shades of ancient Bards repair  To join in choral song his hallow'd urn around  Or wander in the cooling shade  Of Sabine bowers where Horace stray'd  And oft repeat in eager thought elate  As round in classic search you trace  With curious eye the pleasing place  " That fount he lov'd and there beneath that hill he sate"  How longs my raptur'd breast with you  Great Raphael's magic strokes to view  To whose blest hand each charm the Graces gave  Whence each fair form with beauty glows  Like that of Venus when she rose  Naked in blushing charms from Ocean's hoary  As oft by roving fancy led  To smooth Clitumnus' banks you tread  What awful thoughts his fabled waters raise  While the lowthoughted swain whose flock  Grazes around from some steep rock  With vulgar disregard his mazy course surveys  Now thro' the ruin'd domes my Muse  Your steps with eager flight pursues  That their cleft piles on Tyber's plains present  Among whose hollowwinding cells  Forlorn and wild Rome's Genius dwells  His golden sceptre broke and purple mantle rent  Oft to those mossy mouldering walls  Those caverns dark and silent halls  Let me repair by midnight's paly fires  There muse on Empire's fallen state  And frail Ambition's hapless fate  While more than mortal thoughts the solemn scen    What lust of power from the cold North  Could tempt those Vandalrobbers forth  Fair Italy thy vineclad vales to wast  Whose hands profane with hostile blade  Thy story'd temples dar'd invade  And all thy Parian seats of Attic art defac'd  They weeping Art in fetters bound  And gor'd her breast with many a wound  And veil'd her charms in clouds of thickest night  Sad Poesy muchinjur'd maid  They drove to some dim convent's shade  And quench'd in gloomy mist her lamp's resplendent light  There long she wept to darkness doom'd  'Till Cosmo's hand her light relum'd  That once again in losty Tasso shone  Since has sweet Spenser caught her fire  She breath'd once more in Milton's lyre  And warm'd the soul divine of Shakespear Fancy's son  Nor she mild queen will cease to smile  On her Britannia's muchlov'd isle  Where these her best her favourite three were born  While  The author of the Pleasures of Imagination  Theron warbles Graecian strains  Or polish'd Dodington remains  The drooping train of Arts to cherish and adorn  ODE AGAINST DESPAIR  BY THE SAME  FArewell thou dimpled cherub Joy  Thou rosecrown'd eversmiling boy  Wont thy sister Hope to lead  To dance along the primrose mead  No more berest of happy hours  I seek thy luteresounding bowers  But to yon ruin'd tower repair  To meet the God of groans Despair  Who on that ivydarken'd ground  Still takes at eve his silent round  Or sits yon newmade grave beside  Where lies a frantic Suicide  While labouring sighs my heartstrings break  Thus to the sullen Power I speak  " Haste with thy poison'd dagger haste  " To pierce this sorrowladen breast  " Or lead me at the dead of night  " To some seabeat mountain's height  " Whence with headlong haste I'll leap  " To the dark bosom of the deep  " Or shew me far from human eye  " Some cave to muse in starve and die  " No weeping friend or brother near  " My last fond faultering words to hear"  'Twas thus with weight of woes opprest  I sought to ease my bruised breast  When straight more gloomy grew the shade  And lo a tall majestic maid  Her limbs not delicately fair  Robust and of a martial air  She bore of steel a polish'd shield  Where highlysculptur'd I beheld  Th' Athenian  Socrates  martyr smiling stand  The baleful goblet in his hand  Sparkled her eyes with lively flame  And Patience was the seraph's name  Sternly she look'd and stern began  " Thy sorrows cease complaining man  " Rouse thy weak soul appease thy moan  " Soon are the clouds of sadness gone  " Tho' now in Grief's dark groves you walk  " Where griesly fiends around you stalk  " Beyond a blissful city lies  " Far from whose gates each anguish flies  " Take thou this shield which once of yore  " Ulysses and Alcides wore  " And which in later days I gave  " To Regulus and Raleigh brave  " In exile or in dungeon drear  " Their mighty minds could banish fear  " Thy heart no tenfold woes shall feel  " 'Twas Virtue temper'd the rough steel  " And by her heavenly fingers wrought  " To me the precious present brought"  ODE TO THE NIGHTINGALE  BY THE SAME  O Thou that to the moonlight vale  Warblest oft thy plaintive tale  What time the village murmurs cease  And the still eye is hush'd to peace  When now no busy sound is heard  Contemplation's favourite bird  Chauntress of Night whose amorous song  First heard the tufted groves among  Warns wanton Mabba to begin  Her revels on the circled green  Whene'er by meditation led  I nightly seek some distant mead  A short repose of cares to find  And soothe my lovedistracted mind  O fail not then sweet Philomel  Thy sadlywarbled woes to tell  In sympathetic numbers join  Thy pangs of luckless love with mine  So may no swain's rude hand infest  Thy tender young and rob thy nest  Nor ruthless fowler's guileful snare  Lure thee to leave the fields of air  No more to visit vale or shade  Some barbarous virgin's captive made  ODE TO A LADY WHO HATES THE COUNTRY  BY THE SAME  NOW Summer daughter of the Sun  O'er the gay fields comes dancing on  And earth o'erflows with joys  Too long in routs and drawingrooms  The tasteless hours my fair consumes  'Midst folly flattery noise  Come hear mild Zephyr bid the rose  Her balmybreathing buds disclose  Come hear the falling rill  Observe the honeyloaded Bee  The beechembower'd cottage see  Beside yon' sloping hill  By Health awoke at early morn  We'll brush sweet dews from every thorn  And help unpen the fold  Hence to yon hollow oak we'll stray  Where dwelt as villagefables say  An holy Druid old  Come wildly rove thro' desart dales  To listen how lone Nightingales  In liquid lays complain  Adieu the tender thrilling note  That pants in Monticelli's throat  And Handel's stronger strain  " Insipid pleasures these you cry  " Must I from dear assemblies fly  " To see rude peasants toil  " For operas listen to a bird  " Shall  Arcadia  Sydney's fables be preferr'd  " To my sagacious Hoyle  O falsly fond of what seems great  Of purple pomp and robes of state  And all life's tinsel glare  Rather with humble violets bind  Or give to wanton in the wind  Your length of sable hair  Soon as you reach the rural shade  Will Mirth the sprightly mountain maid  Your days and nights attend  She'll bring fantastic Sport and Song  Nor Cupid will be absent long  Your true ally and friend  ODE TO SOLITUDE  BY THE SAME  THOU that at deep dead of night  Walk'st forth beneath the pale moon's light  In robe of flowing black array'd  While cypressleaves thy brows o'ershade  Listening to the crowing cock  And the distant sounding clock  Or sitting in thy cavern low  Do'st hear the bleak winds loudly blow  Or the hoarse deathboding owl  Or village maistiff's wakeful howl  While through thy melancholy room  A dim lamp casts an awful gloom  Thou that on the meadow green  Or daisy'd upland art not seen  But wandering by the dusky nooks  And the pensivefalling brooks  Or near some rugged herbless rock  Where no shepherd keeps his flock  Musing maid to thee I come  Hating the tradeful city's hum  O let me calmly dwell with thee  From noisy mirth and business free  With meditation seek the skies  This follyfetter'd world despise  HOLKHAM  A seat belonging to the earl of Leicester in the county of Norfolk  A POEM  BY MR POTTER  THE lofty beeches and their sacred shade  O'er Penshurst's flower embroider'd vale display'd  Have yet their glory not that Sidney's hand  " Marshall'd in even ranks th' obsequious band"  Or his fresh garlands in these bowers entwin'd  Whilst all Arcadia open'd on his mind  But here sweet Waller breath'd his amorous flame  And taught the groves his Sacharissa's name  Here met the Muse "while gentle Love was by  " That tun'd his lute and wound the strings so high"  Still with th' entraptur'd strains the valleys ring  And the groves flourish in eternal Spring  Eternal Spring smiles in those green retreats  " No more the Monarch's still the Muse's seats"  Where crown'd with towers majestic Windsor stands  And the wide world beneath her feet commands  Not that her regal rampires boast the fame  Of each great Edward's each great Henry's name  Not that in days of highatchiev'd renown  There Britain's Genius fix'd his aweful throne  Encircled with that glorious blaze that springs  From conquer'd nations and from captive kings  When each proud trophy moulders from the wall  And e'en the imperial dome itself shall fall  When those great names the Warrior and the Sage  Lie clouded in the dark historic page  Then shall the heavenborn Muse to whom belong  The more than mortalmaking powers of Song  Thro' Time's deep shades her sacred light display  And pour the beam of Fame's eternal day  Queen of sweet numbers and melodious strains  If yet thou deign to visit Britain's plains  If yet thy hallow'd haunts partake thy love  Clear spring enamel'd vale or bowery grove  O come and range with me th' aspiring glades  Where Leicester spreads the lawns and forms the shades  On Holkham's plains bid Graecian structures rise  And the tall column shoot into the skies  Beneath whose proud survey extended wide  New scenes new beauties charm on every side  Here crown'd with woods the shaded hills ascend  In open light there the low vales extend  Here in rich harvests waves the ripen'd grain  And there fresh verdure cloaths the pastur'd plain  Sweetly intermix'd and lovely to behold  As the green emerald enchas'd in gold  See where the limpid lake thro' pendant shades  The hills between her liquid treasures leads  And to the boughs that fringe her crisped sides  Holds the clear mirror of her crystal tides  Her crystal tides reflect the waving scene  Their silvery surface darkening into green  As on the steep banks bending o'er the flood  Grotesque and wild up springs th' o'ershadowing wood  Or the slope margent with a softer rise  Shade above shade and rank o'er rank supplies  The verdant basis of yon' champain mound  Its hallow'd head with God's own temple crown'd  The homebound mariner from far descries  Emerging from the waves the tall tower rise  With transport bids the solemn structure hail  And wing'd for Britain speeds the flying sail  In nearer view 'midst the lawn's wide extent  That gently swells with an unforc'd ascent  In just proportion rising on the sight  The stately mansion lifts its towery height  And glitters o'er the groves An oak beneath  That calls the cool gales thro' its boughs to breathe  Where the sun darts his fervid rays in vain  Like the great patriarch on Mamre's plain  The princely Leicester sits the pageant pride  Of cumbrous greatness banish'd from his side  In these blest bowers he plans the great design  With heighten'd charms bids modest nature shine  Shows us magnificence allied to use  Tho' rich yet chaste tho' splendid not profuse  Calls forth each beauty that from order springs  From its lov'd Greece each honour'd Science brings  O'er Art's fair train extends his generous care  And bids each polish'd Grace inhabit here  Nor these alone here Virtue loves to dwell  No cold recluse selfcavern'd in a cell  Active and warm she breathes a noble part  Glows in the breast and opens all the heart  To generous deeds she fires th' empassion'd mind  The substitute of heaven to bless mankind  She thro' desponding Misery's chearless gloom  Pours joy and gives neglected Worth to bloom  She in each bosom stills the rising sigh  And wipes off every tear from every eye  She to yon' almshouse bosom'd in the grove  From toil and cares bids Age and Want remove  There the tir'd eve of labour'd life to rest  Fed by her hand and by her bounty blest  These these are rays that round true greatness shine  And thine bright Clifford the full blaze is thine  Bring the green bay the fragraut myrtle bring  The violet glowing in the lap of spring  Bid the sweet vallies send each honied flower  Each herb each leaf of aromatic power  The Muse's hand shall their mix'd odours spread  And screw the ground where Clifford deigns to tread  In distant prospect sinking from the eye  Low in the tufted dales the hamlets lie  Where virgin Innocence and meekey'd Peace  With calm Content the strawroof'd cottage bless  And strongnerv'd Industry in purest flow  Spreads o'er the vermeil cheek Health's roseate glow  More distant yet the throng'd commercial town  That makes the wealth of other worlds her own  Lifts her proud head and sees with every tide  Richfreighted navies croud her harbour'd side  Or bids the parting vessel spread the sail  Loose to the wind and catch the rising gale  Whilst the vast ocean Albion's utmost bound  Rolls its broad wave a world of waters round  In sweet astonishment th' impatient Mind  Bids her free powers expatiate unconfin'd  From scene to scene in rapid progress flies  Glances from earth to seas from seas to skies  Delights to feel the great ideas roll  Swell on the sense and fill up all the soul  Not such the scene when o'er th' uncultur'd wild  No harvest rose no chearful verdure smil'd  On the bare hill no tree was seen to spread  The graceful foliage of its waving head  No breathing hedgerow form'd the broider'd bound  Nor hawthorn blossom'd on th' unsightly ground  Joy was not here no bird of finer note  Pour'd the thick warblings of his dulcet throat  E'en Hope was fled and o'er the chearless plain  A waste of sand Want held her unbless'd reign  Lo Leicester comes Before his mastering hand  Flies the rude Genius of the savage land  The russet lawns a sudden verdure wear  Starts from the wondering fields the golden ear  Up rise the waving woods and haste to crown  The hill's bare brow and shade the sultry down  The shelter'd traveller sees with glad surprise  O'er trackless wilds th' extended rows arise  And as their hospitable branches spread  Blesses the friendly hand that form'd the shade  Joy blooms around and chears the peasant's toil  As smiling plenty decks the cultur'd soil  The brightning scenes a kinder Genius own  And Nature finishes what Art begun  But can the verse tho' Philomela deign  To breathe the sweet notes thro' the warbled strain  Tho' every Muse and every Grace should smile  And raptures raise the honeysteeped style  Can the verse paint like Nature Can the power  That wakes to life free Fancy's imag'd store  Boast charms like her's or the creative hand  In blended tints such beauteous scenes command  Tho' learned Poussin gives each grace to flow  And bright Lorrain's ethereal colours glow  Yet peerless is the power of sacred song  That bursts in transport from the Muse's tongue  And hark methinks her hallow'd voice I hear  In notes mellifluous stealing on the ear  Now clearer and yet clearer trills the strain  Swells thro' the grove and melts along the plain  " Ye nymphs that love to range the lillied vale  " Where streams the silver fount of Acidale  " Ye that in Pindus' laurel'd groves abide  " Or haunt Cyllene's cypressshaded side  " Or braid your fine wreaths in the pearly caves  " Where fam'd Ilissus rolls his Attic waves  " Whilst the barbarian's rude unletter'd race  " Profane your grottos and your bowers deface  " See Leicester courts you to th' Icenian shore  " Studious your longlost honours to restore  " See the fair rival of your native seats  " Aonian Holkham opens all its sweets  " Deign then ye sacred sisters deign to tread  " The rich embroidery of yon velvet mead  " As fresh as lovely as your lilied vale  " Where streams the silver fount of Acidale  " If old Cyllene's cypressshaded bower  " Or Pindus' laurel'd mount delight you more  " Go sweet enthusiasts softlysilent rove  " The studious mazes of the twilight grove  " Or at the foot of some hoar elm reclin'd  " Wake the high thought that swells the raptur'd mind  " Or pensive listen to the solemn roar  " Of whitening billows breaking on the shore  " If the majestic domes whose towery pride  " Glitter o'er fam'd Ilissus' Attic tide  " Your steps detain yon' princely structure view  " Grac'd with each finer art your Athens knew  " Each finer art to just perfection brought  " All that Vitruvius and Palladio thought  " The trophied arch the porphyrypillar'd hall  " The sculptur'd forms that breathe along the wall  " Lycaean Pan the faun's Arcadian race  " The huntressqueen's inimitable grace  " Athenian Pallas clad in radiant arms  " Heaven's empress conscious of her slighted charms  " Your own Apollo on whose polish'd brow  " Youth blooms and grace and candor's brightning glow  " Gods heroes sages an illustrious train  " Court you to Holkham's consecrated plain  " Haste then ye sacred sisters haste and bring  " The laurel steep'd in the Castalian spring  " On the choice bough a purer fragrance breathe  " And twine for Leicester's brow th' unfading wreath"  She ceas'd the raptur'd strain and dear to fame  Flows the proud verse inscrib'd with Leicester's name  THE POOR MAN's PRAYER  WRITTEN ADDRESSED TO THE EARL OF CHATHAM  AMIDST the more important toils of state  The counsels labouring in thy patriot soul  Tho' Europe from thy voice expect her fate  And thy keen glance extend from pole to pole  O Chatham nurs'd in ancient Virtue's lore  To these sad strains incline a favouring ear  Think on the God whom thou and I adore  Nor turn unpitying from the poor man's prayer  Ah me how blest was once a peasant's life  No lawless passion swell'd my even breast  Far from the stormy waves of civil strife  Sound were my slumbers and my heart at rest  I ne'er for guilty painful pleasures rov'd  But taught by Nature and by choice to wed  From all the hamlet cull'd whom best I lov'd  With her I staid my heart with her my bed  To gild her worth I ask'd no wealthy power  My toil could feed her and my arm defend  In youth or age in pain or pleasure's hour  The same fond husband father brother friend  And she the faithful partner of my care  When ruddy evening streak'd the western sky  Look'd towards the uplands if her mate was there  Or thro' the beechwood cast an anxious eye  Then careful matron heap'd the maple board  With savoury herbs and pick'd the nicer part  From such plain food as Nature could afford  Ere simple Nature was debauch'd by Art  While I contented with my homely cheer  Saw round my knees my prattling children play  And oft with pleas'd attention sat to hear  The little history of their idle day  But ah how chang'd the scene On the cold stones  Where wont at night to blaze the chearful fire  Pale Famine sits and counts her naked bones  Still sighs for food still pines with vain desire  My faithful wife with everstreaming eyes  Hangs on my bosom her dejected head  My helpless infants raise their feeble cries  And from their father claim their daily bread  Dear tender pledges of my honest love  On that bare bed behold your brother lie  Three tedious days with pinching want he strove  The fourth I saw the helpless cherub die  Nor long shall ye remain With visage sour  Our tyrant lord commands us from our home  And arm'd with cruel Law's coercive power  Bids me and mine o'er barren mountains roam  Yet never Chatham have I pass'd a day  In Riot's orgies or in idle ease  Ne'er have I sacrific'd to sport and play  Or wish'd a pamper'd appetite to please  Hard was my fare and constant was my toil  Still with the morning's orient light I rose  Fell'd the stout oak or rais'd the lofty pile  Parch'd in the sun in dark December froze  Is it that Nature with a niggard hand  Witholds her gifts from these once favour'd plains  Has God in vengeance to a guilty land  Sent Dearth and Famine to her labouring swains  Ah no yon hill where daily sweats my brow  A thousand flocks a thousand herds adorn  Yon field where late I drove the painful plow  Feels all her acres crown'd with wavy corn  But what avails that o'er the furrow'd soil  In Autumn's heat the yellow harvests rise  If artificial want elude my toil  Untasted plenty wound my craving eyes  What profits that at distance I behold  My wealthy neighbour's fragrant smoke ascend  If still the griping cormorants withold  The fruits which rain and genial seasons send  If those fell vipers of the public weal  Yet unrelenting on our bowels prey  If still the curse of penury we feel  And in the midst of plenty pine away  In every port the vessel rides secure  That wasts our harvest to a foreign shore  While we the pangs of pressing want endure  The sons of strangers riot on our store  O generous Chatham stop those fatal sails  Once more with outstrecth'd arm thy Britons save  The unheeding crew but wait for favouring gales  O stop them ere they stem Italia's wave  From thee alone I hope for instant aid  'Tis thou alone canst save my childrens breath  O deem not little of our cruel meed  O haste to help us for delay is death  So may nor Spleen nor Envy blast thy name  Nor voice profane thy patriot acts deride  Still may'st thou stand the first in honest fame  Unstung by Folly Vanity or Pride  So may thy languid limbs with strength be brac'd  And glowing Health support thy active soul  With fair renown thy public virtue grac'd  Far as thou bad'st Britannia's thunder roll  Then joy to thee and to thy children peace  The grateful hind shall drink from Plenty's horn  And while they share the cultur'd land's increase  The poor shall bless the day when Pitt was born  FIVE PASTORAL  The scenes of these eclogues are supposed to lie among the shepherds oppressed by the war in Germany  ECLOGUES  ECLOGUE I  LYCAS AND ALPHON  ALPHON  ARISE my Lycas in yon' woody wilds  From a rough rock in deep enclosure hid  Of thickest oaks a gushing fountain falls  And pours its airy stream with torrent pure  Which late returning from the field at eve  I found invited by its dashing sound  As thro' the gloom it struck my passing ear  Thither I mean to drive our languid flocks  Fit place to cool their thirst in midday hour  Due west it rises from that blasted beech  The way but shortcome Lycas rouze thy dog  Let us be gone  LYCAS  Alas my friend of flock  Of spring or shepherd's lore to me is vain  To tell my favourite lamb the solace dear  Of these grey locks my sweet and sole delight  Is snatch'd by cruel fate An armed band  On neighing steeds elate in wide array  Trampled the youngling as the vale along  At eve they pass'd beneath their whelming march  ALPHON  Such throng I heard as in the neighbouring wood  I wander'd to reduce a straggling ewe  Escap'd the fold what time the griesly owl  Her shrieks began and at the wonted elm  The cows awaiting stood Lucilla's hand  When strait with sudden fear alarm'd I start  And listening to the distantechoing steps  Of unseen horsemen with attentive ear  I stand aloof But why this deepfelt grief  Merits such loss these tears and black despair  LYCAS  Alphon no more to Lycas now remains  Since he my last and latest care is lost  Thou know'st my little flock three tender ewes  Were all my mean ambition wish'd or sought  Even now nine days and nine revolving nights  Are past since these the Moldaw's raging flood  Swept with their wattled cotes as o'er its banks  It rose redundant swoln with beating rains  And deep immers'd beneath its whirling wave  I wak'd at early dawn and to the field  I issu'd to pursue my wonted toil  When lo nor flocks nor wattled cotes I saw  But all that met my wondering eyes around  Was desolation sad Here stateliest oaks  Torn from their roots with broken branches lay  In hideous ruin there the fields that laugh'd  With ripening corn of all their charms despoil'd  With oozy fragments scatter'd waste and wild  Were seen I curst the wicked Spirit drear  That in the ruin'd abbey's darkest cell  That stands immur'd amid yon' lonesome piles  I bound with triple chains his magic power  Ofttimes with howling storms and thunder loud  Deforms the night and blackens Nature's face  His tempests swell'd the Moldaw's rising streams  And thus o'erwhelm'd my flockBut this my heart  Had learn'd to bear at length to Comfort's voice  It had obey'd and all its woes forgot  When ah too soon returning woes invade  My breast just rising from its former stroke  When this the sole survivor of my flock  Follows his lost companions while a wretch  I here remain deserted and forlorn  He too had dy'd beneath the whelming surge  Had not the shelter of my lowroof'd cott  That fatal night preserv'd him where at eve  I hap'ly plac'd him with providing care  Lest the fell storm which yet from southern clouds  Threaten'd destruction and to lour began  Might violate his tenderblooming age  ALPHON  With piteous eye and sympathizing heart  Thy tears I viewThese scenes of war and blood  The calm repose of every field invade  Myself had fallen a victim to their rage  As in deep dead of night my cave beneath  I lay dissolv'd in sleep with warning voice  Had not my dog alarm'd with wondering ear  When straight approach'd the cave a savage throng  With barbarous arms and habit fierce and wild  With stern demeanour and defying look  Terrify which the moon's paleglimmering rays  Presented to my sight as in the boughs  Close shrouded of a neighbouring pine I sat  Where sudden fear had driven me to evade  Impending fate unconscious and amaz'd  Secure but trembling and in chilly damps  My limbs bedew'dThe monsters as they past  With dire confusion all the cavern fill'd  Hurl'd to the ground my scrip and beechen cup  Dispers'd the shaggy skins that form my bed  And o'er the trampled floor had scatter'd wide  A hoard of choicest chesnuts which I cull'd  With nicediscerning care and had design'd  A present to my beauteous Rosalind  Alas with them her love had been obtain'd  And me to Myron she had then preferr'd  LYCON  Shepherd on thee has Fortune kindly smil'd  Tis mine to feel her griefinflicting hand  Alas each object that I view around  Recalls my perish'd darling to my sight  And mocks me with his loss See there the spring  Where oft he wont to slake his eager thirst  And there the beech beneath whose breezy shade  He lov'd to lie close covert from the sun  See yet the bark smoothworn and bare remains  Where oft the youngling rubb'd his tender side  Ah what avail'd my care and foresight vain  That day he fell oppress'd by whelming steeds  This hand had built a bower of thickest boughs  Compos'd and wove with intermingling leaves  Impervious to the sun and strew'd the floor  With choicest hay that in the secret shade  He might repose nor feel the dogstar's beam  But why this sad repeated track of woe  I still pursue Farewel my Alphon dear  To distant fields and pastures will I go  Where impious War and Discord nurse of blood  Shall ne'er profane the silence of the groves  ECLOGUE II  ACIS AND ALCYON  ACIS  WHILE in the bosom of this deep recess  The voice of war has lost its madding shouts  Let us improve the transient hour of peace  And calm our troubled minds with mutual songs  While this recess conspiring with the Muse  Invites to peaceful thoughts this cavern deep  And these tall pines that nodding from the rock  Wave o'er its mouth their umbrage black and cast  A venerable gloom with this clear fount  That cleaves the riven stone and fills the cave  With hollowtinkling sounds Repeat the song  Which late Alcyon from thy mouth I heard  As to the spring we drove our thirsting slocks  It tells the charms of grateful Evening mild  Begin Alcyon Acis in return  Shall sing the praises of the dawning Morn  ALCYON  Behind the hills when sinks the western sun  And falling dews breathe fragrance thro' the air  Refreshing every field with coolness mild  Then let me walk the twilight meadows green  Or breezy uplands near thickbranching elms  While the still landscape sooths my soul to rest  And every care subsides to calmest peace  The mists slowrising from the rivers dank  The woods scarce stirring at the whispering wind  The streaky clouds that tinge their darken'd tops  With russet hues and fainter gleams of light  The solitude that all around becalms  The peaceful air conspire to wrap my soul  In musings mild and nought the solemn scene  And the still silence breaks but distant sounds  Of bleating flocks that to their destin'd fold  The shepherd drives meantime the shrilltun'd bell  Of some lone ewe that wanders from the rest  Tinkles far off with solitary sound  The lowing cows that wait the milker's hand  The cottagemastiff's bark the joyous shouts  Of swains that meet to wrestle on the green  Are heard around But ah since ruthless war  Has ravag'd in these fields so tranquil once  Too oft alas the din of clashing arms  And discord fell disturbs the softer scene  Thy sweet approach delights the wearied ox  While in loose traces from the furrow'd field  He comes thy dawn the weary reaper loves  Who long had sainted in the midday sun  Pleas'd with the cooler hour along the vale  Whistling he home returns to kiss his babes  With joyful heart his labour's sweet reward  But ah what sudden fears amaze his soul  When near approaching all before he sees  His lowly cottage and the village 'round  Swept into ruin by the hand of war  Dispers'd his children and his muchlov'd wife  No more to glad his breast with home feltjoys  I too when in my wattled cotes are laid  My supping flock rejoice to meet my dear  My fair Lauretta at the wonted oak  Or haply as her mikingpail she bears  Returning from the field to ease her arm  Sweet office and impart my aiding hand  Thy charms O beauteous Evening shall be sung  As long as these tall pines shall wave their heads  Or this clear fountain cleave the riven stone  ACIS  Sweet are the dews of Eve her fragrance sweet  Sweet are the pinetopt hills at sultry noon  Sweet is the shelter of the friendly grot  To sheep and shepherd at impending storms  But ah less sweet the fragrant dews of Eve  Less sweet the pinetopt hills at sultry noon  Less sweet the shelter of the friendly grots  Than when the rising sun with rosy beam  Peeps o'er the villagetop and o'er the fields  The woods the hills the streams and level meads  Scatters bright splendors and diffusive joy  As to his flock the shepherd issues forth  Printing new footsteps in the dewy vale  Each object of the joyous scene around  Vernal delight inspires and glads his heart  Unknowing of the cause with newfelt glee  The chaunt of early birds on every bush  The steaming odours of the freshblown flowers  ALCYON  Cease Acis cease thy songfrom yonder hill  Whose lofty sides inclose this secret seat  Our flocks that graze along its verdurous brow  Tumultuous rush as struck with sudden fright  And hark methinks I hear the deathful sounds  Of war approaching and its thunders roar  ACIS  Kind heaven preserve my wife and children dear  Alas I fear the sound that louder now  Swells in the wind and comes with fuller din  Is near my cottage which thou know'st my friend  Stands at the spring that issues from beneath  That rising hill fast by the branching elm  ALCYON  See see my friend what darksome spires arise  Of wreathing smoak and blacken all the sky  Nearer and nearer comes the threatening voice  And more distinguish'd strikes our trembling ear  But lo the foes advance above the hill  I see their glittering arms begin to gleam  Come let us slie and in the deepest nook  The inmost cavern of this winding grott  Close shroud ourselves lest in the general stream  Of thousands thronging down we sall opprest  ECLOGUE III  WHEN sable midnight on the fields and woods  Had spread her mantle dark then wander'd forth  The pensive Alcon and the bosom deep  Of a wild wood with solitary steps  There to lament his wretched fate he sought  Him late as o'er the vale at coming eve  Joyful he walk'd with his Lucilla dear  A soldier stern advancing on his steed  Robb'd of his love and to  e the beauteous maid  With brutal hand from his contending arms  Weeping in vain and shricking for his aid  And frowning bore the precious prize away  The wood whose shades the plaintive shepherd sought  Was dark and pathless and by neighbouring seet  Long time untrod for there in ancient days  Two knights of bold emprise and high renown  Met in sierce combat to d  spute the prize  Of beauty bright whose valiant arm should win  A virgin fair whose fairemblazon'd charms  With equal love had smote their rival breasts  The knight who fell beneath the victor's sword  Unhears'd and restless from that fatal day  Wanders the hated shades a spectre pale  And each revolving night are heard to sound  Far from the inmost bower of the deep wood  Loud shrieks and hollow groans and rattling chains  When the dark secrets of the grove he gain'd  Beneath an ancient oak his weary limbs  He laid adown and thus to plain began  This midnight deep to plaintive love accords  This lonesome silence and these hideous shades  That in this darksome hour I dare to tread  And all the horrors of this fearful place  Will suit a wretch abandon'd to despair  But ahwhat means this sudden fear that creeps  In chilly sweats o'er all my trembling limbs  What hollow whispering sounds are those I hear  From yonder gladeDo not I hear his voice  Does not the knight that in these shades was slain  Call me to come and beckon with his hand  Do not I see his visionary sword  Wav'd in bright circles thro' the murky air  Does not he point his woundsBe still my sears  'Tis vain illusion all and phantasie  These sears my lovedistemper'd brain suggests  Alas they will not bring me back my love  Who now perhaps amid the thronging camp  On earth's cold breast reclines her weary head  A helpless virgin subject to the will  Of each rude ravisher and distant far  From her dear Alcon and her native fields  Ill will the hardships of inclement skies  Suit with her tender limbs the various toils  Of painful marches her unwonted ears  How bear the trumpet and the sounds of war  This task is hard indeedbut soon alas  At will her savage lord may cast her off  And leave her to succeeding scenes of woe  I see my dear Lucilla once my own  Naked and hungry tread the pensive steps  Of Desolation doom'd to wander o'er  Helpless and vagabond the friendless earth  I hear her sigh for Alcon and her home  And ask for bread at some proud palacegate  With unavailing voice This toilsome scene  Alas how different from the smoother paths  Of rural life my dear was wont to tread  Forth to the field to bear the milkingpail  Was all her wont to tread the tedded grass  To tend her father's flock beneath the oak  To snatch her dinner sweet and on the green  With the companions of her age to sport  In vain I now expect the coming on  Of dewbath'd Eve to meet my wonted love  No more I hear the woodgirt vallies ring  With her blythe voice that oft has blest mine ear  As in the distant shade I sat unseen  No more I meet her at the wonted spring  Where each revolving noon she daily went  To fill her pitcher with the crystal flood  If in her native fields the hand of death  Had snatch'd her from my arms I could have born  The fatal shoek with less repining heart  For then I could have had one parting kiss  I could have strewn her hearse with fairest flowers  And paid the last sad office to my dear  Return my sweet Lucilla to my arms  At thy return all Nature will rejoice  Together will we walk the verdant vales  And mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet  Come I will climb for thee the knotted oak  To rob the stockdove of his feathery young  I'll shew thee where the softest cowslips spring  And clustering nuts their laden branches bend  Together will we taste the dews of morn  Together seek the grotts at sultry noon  Together from the field at eve return  What have I said what painted scenes of bliss  My vain imagination has display'd  Alas she's gone ah never to return  Farewell my pasteral pipe and my dear flock  Farewell my faithful dog my oncelov'd haunts  Farewell or cave or fountain or fresh shade  Farewell and thou my low  or'd cott farewell  Here will I lie and fellest wolves that roam  This savage forest shall devour my limbs  Unwept unburied in a place unknown"  ECLOGUE IV  MYCON AND PHILANTHES  MYCON  WELCOME Philanthes to thy native fields  Thrice three revolving moons are gone and past  Since first you parted from your father's cott  To drive to pastures far remote your flock  Since that alas how oft has savage war  Disturb'd our dwellings and defac'd our fields  PHILANTHES  Mycon each object that I view around  Speaks ruin and destruction See my friend  The ancient wood whose venerable shades  So oft have shelter'd us from noonday suns  So oft have echo'd to the lowing herds  That fed widewandering in the neighbouring vales  The soldier's ax has levell'd with the ground  And to the sun expos'd its darksome bowers  The distant villages and bluetopt hills  The farstretch'd meads appear and meet mine eyes  That erst were intercepted by the grove  MYCON  How is the wonted face of all things chang'd  Those trees by whose aspiring tops we knew  The sun's ascent at noon unerring mark  No more are seen to tell the coming hour  How naked does the winding rill appear  Whose banks its pendant umbrage deepimbrown'd  And farinvested with its arborous roof  As by its side it roll'd its secret streams  How oft alas those shadowy banks along  Close solitude my Rosalind and I  Have walk'd in converse sweet and link'd in love  But tell me dear Philanthes are the fields  Which late you left like ours by war opprest  Alike in tumult and confusion wrapt  PHILANTHES  Mycon I'll tell thee wonders past belief  It happ'd one morn when first the dawning sun  Began to chear the lightenliven'd earth  Caught with so bright a scene I sought the fields  Before my wonted hour and roving wide  Among the vales the villages and woods  Where'er my fancy led or pleasure call'd  I chanc'd upon a neighbouring hill to stray  To view the glittering prospect from its top  Of the broad Rhine that roll'd his waves beneath  Amid the level of extended meads  When  It m  be supposed that in these lines the shepherd is giving an account of Prince Charles's passing the Rhine  lo ere yet I gain'd its lofty brow  The sound of dashing floods and dashing arms  And neighing steeds confusive struck mine ear  Studious to know what tumult was at hand  With step adventurous I advanc'd and gain'd  With timorous care and cautious ken its top  Sudden a burst of brightness smote my sight  From arms and all th' imblazonrie of war  Reflected far while steeds and men and arms  Seem'd floating wide and stretch'd in vast array  O'er the broad bosom of the bigswoln flood  That dashing roll'd its beamy waves between  The banks promiscuous  m'd with thronging troops  These on the flood embarking those appear'd  Crowding the adverse shore already past  All was confusion all tumultuous    I trembled as I look'd tho' far above  And in one blaze their arms were blended bright  With the broad stream while all the glistening scene  The morn illum'd and in one splendor clad  Struck at the sight I lest with headlong haste  The steepbrow'd hill and o'er th' extended vales  The woodgirt lawns I ran nor slack'd my pace  Till at my flock thickpanting I arriv'd  And drove far off beneath a deeparch'd cave  But come my friend inform me in return  Since this my absence what has here fell out  MYCON  Dost thou remember at the river side  That solitary convent all behind  Hid by the covert of a mantling wood  One night when all was wrapt in darkness deep  An armed troop on rage and rapine bent  Pour'd o'er the fields and ravag'd all they met  Nor did that sacred pile escape their arms  Whose walls the murderous band to ruin swept  And fill'd its caverns deep with armed throngs  Greedy of spoil and snatch'd their treasures old  From their dark seats the shrieking sisters fled  Dispers'd and naked thro' the fields and woods  While sable night conceal'd their wandering steps  Part in my moss grown cottage shelter sought  Which haply scap'd their rage in secret glade  Immersed deepI rose at early morn  With fearful heart to view the ruin'd dome  Where all was desolation all appear'd  The seat of horror and devouring war  The deep recesses and the gloomy nooks  The vaulted isles and shrines of imag'd saints  The caverns worn by holy knees appear'd  And to the sun were op'dIn musing thought  I said as on the pile I bent my brow  " This seat to future ages will appear  " Like that which stands fast by the piny rock  " These silent walls with ivy shall be hung  " And distant times shall view the sacred pile  " Unknowing how it fell with pious awe  " The pilgrim here shall visit and the swain  " Returning from the field at twilight grey  " Shall shun to pass this way subdued by fear  " And slant his course across the adverse vale"  PHILANTHES  Mycon thou see'st that cow which stands in cool  Amid yon rushy lake beneath the shade  Of willow green and ruminates at ease  The watry herbage that around her floats  That way my business leads I go to greet  My father and my wonted cottage dear  MYCON  Come let us go my path is that way too  Come my Philanthes and may piteous heaven  Indulge more happy days and calm our griefs  Alas I thought some trouble was at hand  And long before presag'd the coming storm  Even when the lightning one disastrous night  Blasted the hoary oak whose ample boughs  Imbower my cottage and as on the grass  At noon I slept a serpent's sudden hiss  Broke my sweet restBut come let us be gone  The sun begins to welk in ruddy west  ECLOGUE V  CORIN AND CALISTAN  CORIN  WHICH way Calistan whither dost thou lead  That lamb whom yet his mother scarce has wean'd  CALISTAN  His mother Corin as she wandering fed  With this tender youngling by her side  Fell by a shot which from the battle came  That in the neighbouring fields so lately rag'd  CORIN  Alas What woes that fatal day involv'd  Our suffering village and the fields around  But come Calistan on this rising bank  Come let us sit and on the danger past  Converse secure and number all our griefs  See how the flaunting woodbine shades the bank  And weaves a mantling canopy above  CALISTAN  Corin that day I chanc'd at earlier hour  To rise and drove faroff my flock unpent  To wash them in a spring that late I mark'd  There the first motions of the deathful day  I heard as listening to the trickling wave  I stood attentive when like rising storms  Hoarse hollow murmurs from asar I heard  And undistinguish'd sounds of distant din  Alarm'd I stood unknowing whence it came  And from the fount my flock unwash'd I drove  Suspecting danger when as nearer yet  I came advancing all was tumult loud  All was tempestuous din on every side  And all around the roar of war was up  From rock to rock retost from wood to wood  Not half so loud the tumbling cataract  Is heard to roar that from the pineclad cliff  Precipitates its waves whose distant sounds  I oft have listen'd as at twilight grey  I pent my flocks within their wattled cotes  CORIN  For three revolving days nor voice of bird  Melodious chaunting or the bleat of sheep  Or lowing oxen near the fatal place  Were heard to sound but all was silence sad  The ancient grove of elms deserted stood  Where long had dwelt an aged race of rooks  That with their nests had crowded every branch  We oft have heard them at the dusk of eve  In troops returning to their well known home  In mingled clamours sounding from on high  CALISTAN  Corin thou know'st the firinvested cave  Where late we shelter'd from a gathering storm  Our flocks together driven beneath its shade  I had appointed at sweet eventide  To meet my Delia homeward as she pass'd  Bearing her milkingpail  Alas the thoughts  Of that sweet congress the preceding night  Soften'd my dreams and all my senses lull'd  And with more joyful heart at morn I rose  But ah that tumult cropt my blooming hopes  And in confusion wrapt my love and me  CORIN  That day nor in the fold my flock I pent  Or walk'd at eve the vales or on the turf  Beneath the wonted oak my dinner took  Or slept at noon amid my languid sheep  Repos'd at ease on the green meadow's bed  When sable night came on for not even yet  The tumult had subsided into peace  Even then low sounds and interrupted bursts  Of war we heard and cries of dying men  And a confus'd hum of the ceasing storm  All night closeshrouded in a forest thick  Wakeful I sat my flock around me laid  And of neglected boughs I kindled up  A scanty flame whose darklygleaming blaze  Among th' enlighten'd trees form'd hideous shapes  And spectres pale to my distemper'd mind  How oft I look'd behind with cautious fear  And trembled at each motion of the wind  But where did you Calistan shelter seek  What dark retreat conceal'd your wandering steps  CALISTAN  Corin thou know'st the furclad Hermit's cell  Deeparch'd beneath a rock among the wilds  Thither I bent my flight a welcome guest  And not unknown for when my flock I fed  Of late beneath the neighbouring pastures green  I oft was wont invited at his call  At noon beneath his cavern to retire  From the sun's heat where all the passing hours  The good old man improv'd with converse high  And in my breast enkindled Virtue's love  Nor seldom would his hospitable hand  Afford a short repast of berries cool  Which o'er the wilds his scanty food he pluck'd  Here was my refugeAll the livelong night  Pensive by one pale lonesome lamp we sat  And listen'd to the bleak winds whistling loud  And the shrill crash of forests from without  Soon as the morning dawn'd the craggy height  Of the steep rock I climb'd on whose wild top  His rustic temple stood and mossgrown cross  The sacred object of his pious prayers  Form'd of a tall fir's thunderblasted trunk  Where all beneath th' expansive plains I saw  With white pavilions hid in deep array  There too my little fold which late I left  Standing at eve amid the warlike scene  With tearful eyes affrighted I beheld  Alas how chang'd the scene when there I pitch'd  Those hurdled cotes the night was calm and mild  And all was peaceful I remember well  While there within that fold my flock I pent  How blythe I heard my beauteous Delia sing  Her distant echoing voice how sweetly rung  And all my ravish'd senses wrapt in bliss  CORIN  Hast thou not seen the fatal plain of death  Where rag'd the conflict There they say at eve  Grim ghosts are seen of men that there were slain  Pointing their wounds and shrieking to their mates  Still doom'd to haunt the fields on which they fell  CALISTAN  Corin no more This lamb demands my speed  See how the youngling hangs his sickly head  Tender and fainting for his wonted food  I haste to place him in my sheltering cot  Fed from my hand and cherish'd by my care  And see my friend far off in darken'd west  A cloud comes on and threatens sudden rains  Corin farewell the storm begins to lower  ON THE PEACE OF AIX LA CHAPELLE MDCCXLVIII  BY MR HURD  BE still my fears suggest no false alarms  The Poet's rapture and the lyric fire  Are vain enough that inclination warms  No foreign influence needs the willing Muse inspire  The willing Muse adventurous in her flight  To thee lov'd Peace shall raise the untaught strain  Her thy fair triumphs and thy arts delight  Thy festive branch she bears and joins thy social train  High on some wave worn cliff she views serene  Safe on the deep the freighted navies ride  Old Ocean joys to see the peaceful scene  And bids his billows roll with an exulting tide  Or where Augusta's turrets cleave the skies  She loves to mix with Art's inventive band  Sees Industry in forms unnumber'd rise  To scatter blessings wide and civilize the land  Or flies with transport to her native plain  Sees cornclad fields fresh lawns and pastures fair  Sees Plenty vindicate her ancient reign  And pour forth all her charms to crown the various year  But chief the Muse to Academic groves  Her kindred train and bestlov'd arts invite  Thro' Cam's o'ershadowing bowers intranc'd she roves  Whence sacred Science streams and Genius spreads his light  " Here will I rest she cry'd my laurel here  " Eternal blooms here hangs my golden lyre  " Which erst my Spenser tun'd to shepherd's ear  " And lostiest Milton smote with genuine epic fire  " And O if aught my fond presages shew  " On these lov'd bowers while Peace her influence sheds  " Some hand again shall snatch it from the bough  " Wake each highsounding string and charm the echoing glades  " Then shall be sung the glorious deeds of war  " How Virtue strove where envious Fortune fail'd  " Expecting Fame the conflict view'd from far  " And Britain's valour crown'd tho' Gallia's host prevail'd  " Yet then even then th' indignant verse shall tell  " A surer vengeance rose to whelm the foe  " When hellborn Faction issu'd from her cell  " And on her impious head drew half the destin'd blow  " But hark the loud triumphant strains declare  " How Britain's majesty unrivall'd rose  " When all the glories of the naval war  " Beam'd round her conquering flag and circled Anson's brows"  Till thus the Power by Freedom's sons obey'd  " Let bloodstain'd glory swell the tyrant's breast  " Be mine Compassion's healing wing to spread  " To sheath the wasting sword and give the nations rest  " Then as the Muse inraptur'd shall display  " War's impious roar and Faction's murmurs cease  " His gracious eye sheds lustre on the day  " And lends the quickening beam to chear the arts of Peace"  LAURA OR THE COMPLAINT AN ELEGY  BY JAMES MARRIOTT L L D  YE groves with venerable moss array'd  That o'er yon caverns stretch your pendent shade  Where sacred Silence lulls the rural vale  And Love in whispers tells his tender tale  Ye lonely rocks ye streams that ever flow  Still as my tears and constant as my woe  To you behold the wretched Laura flies  And haunts those seats from whence her sorrows rise  Where lost to love how often has she stray'd  When the fond lover led his blushing maid  When his soft lips too eloquent his art  Pour'd the warm wish and breath'd out all his heart  Ah once lov'd seats your pleasing scenes are o'er  Nor you can charm since he can love no more  Tho' smile your lawns with vernal glories crown'd  In vain gay Nature paints th' enamel'd ground  While through your solitary paths I rove  A prey to grief to sickness and to love  Tho' gentle Zephyrs fan the bending bowers  Tho' breathes the incense of your opening flowers  Nor opening flowers nor gentle Zephyrs charm  Nor beauteous scenes a grief like mine disarm  Fade every flower and languish every sense  Ye have no sweets for fallen innocence  Torn by remorse sad victim of Despair  Where shall I turn or where address my prayer  Far as the morn its early beam displays  Or where the star of evening darts its rays  Far as wide earth is stretch'd or oceans roll  Where blow the winds or heaven invests the pole  In vain my fluttering soul would wing its way  Stern Care pursues where'er the wretched stray  Sost God of Sleep whose everpeaceful reign  Lulls earth and heaven and all the extended main  Powerful to give the labouring heart to rest  To wipe the tear and heal the wounded breast  Say by what crime offended slies from me  Invok'd thy unpropitious Deity  Or dooms on racks of wildest Fancy torn  In dreams my agonizing soul to mourn  Why am I oft on angry billows tost  Now in some wide and dreary desart lost  Why yet in life infernal tortures feel  Bound by fierce demons to some rapid wheel  Now seem to climb while hills on hills arife  In vain or fall in tempests from the skies  Tread burning plains or swim in seas of fire  Just reach the shore then see the shore retire  As oft dear youth thy pleasing form appears  I stretch my arms and wake dissolv'd in tears  Yet waking Fancy all that loss supplies  And still I view thee with a lover's eyes  Entranc'd in thought o'er all thy charms I gaze  See thy bright eyes diffuse their softest rays  Hang on thy hand and on thy breast reclin'd  Play with thy locks that waver with the wind  Joy in thy joy or in thy sorrows join  And on thy lips my spirit mix with thine  Now o'er dark wilds or rugged rocks we stray  Love lights the gloom and smooths the dreary way  Now on soft banks our weary limbs repose  Where every flower of vernal beauty glows  But light as air each pleasing vision flew  Swift as the fun dispels the morning dew  While with the day returns the sense of woe  We wake more wretched when the cheat we know  Imagination mistress of the soul  What powers unseen the active mind controul  And fill the waking thought or busy sleep  When not a breeze disturbs the tranquil deep  Nor lofty pines through all the forest move  Why stir the motions of resistless love  Urg'd by the golden morn the night recedes  And year to year in changeful course succeeds  Nor night nor morn nor years to me restore  The peace which Laura's heart possess'd before  Involv'd in clouds one darksome scene I view  Bleed the same wounds and all my pains renew  O boast of Laura's longforgotten praise  Past are the triumphs of my happier days  When plac'd supreme on Beauty's radiant throne  I saw with conscious pride each heart my own  Where'er I turn'd a thousand nymphs admir'd  Whene'er I smil'd a thousand swains expir'd  I spoke 'twas music dwelt upon my tongue  I mov'd a goddess and an angel sung  My careless steps in joys were taught to rove  Each voice was flattery and each look was love  But Beauty's power too mighty long to last  Fled on the wings of rapid Time is past  As some proud vessel to the prosperous gale  Her streamer waves and spreads the silken sail  While silver oars to flutes soft breathing sweep  With measur'd strokes the scarcely heaving deep  But soon tempestuous clouds the scene deform  And the loud surge remurmurs to the storm  Thus big with hope from dark suspicion free  I sail'd with transport on Life's summer sea  The gay attendants of my happy state  The Smiles the Graces round were seen to wait  And all the moments as they swiftly flew  Shower'd down soft joys and pleasures ever new  How chang'd this fleeting image of a day  How sets in awful gloom the evening ray  While fixt on earth her eye in sad suspence  Pours the deep sigh incessant Penitence  If youthful charms decay with age or pain  Beauty thy crouded worshippers how vain  Why then such crowds of incense round ascend  Why prostrate monarchs at thy altars bend  Why earth's and ocean's mighty bounds explore  At once to win thee and increase thy power  Let sad example Reason's dictates aid  Here see what ruin Grief and Love have made  Even Love who lives by Beauty's smiles carest  Basks in her eyes and wantons on her breast  With cruel force the fatal shaft employs  And soonest what he most adores destroys  How cold I feel Life's idle current flow  Where once the dancing spirits lov'd to glow  No more these eyes with youthful rapture shine  Nor cheeks soft blushing speak a warmth divine  Graceful no more amid the festive dance  My steps with easy dignity advance  And all the glossy locks whose ringlets spread  O'er my fair neck the honours of my head  Cease the neat labours of my hand to know  Ill suits the care of elegance with woe  Why did not Nature when she gave to charm  With unrelenting pride my bosom arm  Why was my soul its tender pity taught  Each soft affection and each generous thought  Hence spring my sorrows hence with sighs I prove  How feeble woman and how fierce is love  In unavailing streams my tears are shed  Sad Laura's bliss is with Lorenzo fled  For thee false youth was every joy resign'd  Young health sweet peace and innocence of mind  Are these the constant vows thy tongue profest  When first thy arms my yielding beauties prest  Thus did thy kiss dispel my empty fears  Or winning voice delight my raptur'd ears  Thus swore thy lips by ocean earth and sky  By hell's dread powers and heaven's allpiercing eye  Yawns not the grave for thee Why sleeps the storm  To blast thy limbs and rend thy perjur'd form  Unmov'd O faithless canst thou hear my pain  Like the proud rocks which brave th' unwearied main  Sooner the shipwreck'd pilot shall appease  With sighs the howling winds with tears the seas  Than Laura's prayers thy heart unfeeling move  O lost to fame to honour and to love  Nurst in dark caverns on some mountain wild  To cruel manhood grew the daring child  No female breast supplied thy infant food  But tygers growling o'er their savage brood  Curs'd be that fatal hour thy charms were seen  While yet this mind was guiltless and serene  With thee false man I urg'd my hasty flight  And dar'd the horrors of tempestuous night  Nor fear'd with thee through plains unknown to rove  Deaf to the dictates of paternal love  In vain for me a parent's tears were shed  And to the grave descends his hoary head  When at my feet entranc'd my lover lay  And pour'd in tender sighs his soul away  Fond foolish heart to think the tale divine  Why started not my hands when prest in thine  Too well Remembrance paints the fatal hour  When Love great conqueror summon'd all his power  When bolder grown your glances flash'd with fire  And your pale lips all trembled with desire  Back to my heart my blood tumultuous flew  From every pore distill'd the chilling dew  When Shame presaging spoke each future pain  And struggling Virtue arm'd my soul in vain  But O let silence all my weakness veil  And burning blushes only tell the tale  Ah faithless man and thou more wretched maid  To guilt and grief and misery betray'd  Far flies thy lover to some distant plain  Now cleaves his bounding bark the peaceful main  Avenging heaven that heard the vows he swore  Bid howl the blackening storm and thunder roar  'Till waves on waves in tumbling mountains roll  Now sink to hell and now ascend the pole  Then on some plank o'er foaming billows borne  Trembling his perjur'd faith the wretch shall mourn  But mourn in vain his vigorous arm shall fail  Guilt sink him down and angry heaven prevail  No friendly hand to earth his limbs convey  But dogs and vultures tear the bloated prey  Yet ah fond heart avert kind heaven the stroke  My heart denies what trembling lips have spoke  The varying accents real nature prove  And only shew how wild a thing is love  Go much lov'd youth with every blessing crown'd  And Laura's wishes ever guard thee round  Me to the silent shades and sad retreat  Where love's expiring flames forget their heat  Death wooes allpowerful ere he parts the clew  Once more thy Laura bids her love adieu  Bids health and affluence every bliss afford  Bids thee be lov'd be happy and ador'd  In ease in mirth glide each glad hour away  No pain to spot thy Fortune's cloudless day  Nor sigh to swell no tear to flow for me  O grant heaven all but grant thee constancy  Yet from my hand this last address receive  This last address is all that hand can give  In vain thy bark with spreading canvas flies  If these sad lines shall meet thy conscious eyes  And taught with winning eloquence to move  The winds and waters waft the voice of love  That voice O grant what dying lips implore  Asks but one tear from thee and asks no more  Then world farewel farewel life's fond desires  False flattering hopes and love's tormenting fires  Already Death before my closing eyes  Thy airy forms and glimmering shades arise  Hark hear I not for me yon' passing bell  Toll forth with frequent pause its sullen knell  Waits not for me yon' sexton on his spade  Blythe whistling o'er the grave his toil has made  Say why in lengthened pomp yon' sable train  With measur'd steps slow stalk along the plain  Say why yon' hearse with fading flowers is crown'd  And midnight gales the deepmouth'd dirge resound  Hail sister worms and thou my kindred dust  Secure to you my weary limbs I trust  Dim burns life's lamp O Death thy work compleat  And give my soul to gain her last retreat  Such as before the birth of Nature sway'd  Ere springing light the first great word obey'd  Let silence reigncome Fate exert thy might  And darkness wrap me in eternal night  RINALDO AND ARMIDA  TO A LADY SINGING  BY THE SAME  THE goldfinch swells his little throat  And loudly pours his rural note  High poiz'd above his nest in air  The shrill lark chaunts his matins clear  At evening brown in woodland dale  Soft gurgling trills her amorous tale  The solitary nightingale  But what avails ye feather'd throng  Of warblers wild your feeble song  Our varying passions can ye move  With warmer hope or fonder love  Or run your notes th' enchanting round  Through all the labyrinths of sound  As breathes some soft angelic strain  When Midnight spreads her solemn reign  Entranc'd the lonely hermit lies  And tastes ideal paradise  When at Armida's feet he lay  So sigh'd Rinaldo's soul away  His tongue in mute attention bound  His ear in rapture drank the sound  While magic numbers lull'd the sense  And held swift thought in sweet suspence  The mimic voice repeat the gales  That sigh along the flowery vales  The flowery vales the falling floods  The rising rocks and waving woods  To the sighing gales reply  Redoubling all the harmony  The Zephyrs ever mild and fair  Who lightly fan the vernal air  Learn from Armida's voice the strain  And whispering tell it to the main  Whene'er the foaming billows flowing  The wintry storms are fiercely blowing  When sable clouds invade the pole  And lightnings dart and thunders roll  Th' enchantress can the rage appease  And clear the skies and smooth the seas  When hurried to th' infernal coast  His beauteous bride the Thracian lost  Sure hapless youth so sweet a spell  Once more had charm'd the powers of hell  Or if such had been the song  Which warbled erst the syren throng  For councils sage the chief renown'd  His warrior limbs had vainly bound  His eyes by love entranc'd no more  Had seen with joy their native shore  The cords had loos'd the magic tale  Had stay'd his oars and furl'd his sail  SACRED ODE  BY THE SAME  HARK thro' yon' fretted vaults and lofty spires  Peal the deep organs to the sacred quires  And now the full the loud hosannas rise  Float in the winds and roll along the skies  The solemn sounds Devotion's ardour raise  Now mounts the spirit with diviner blaze  Heaven opens earth recedes and Nature feels  The ray that fir'd the prophet's glowing wheels  In fiery pomp bright seraphs quit the sky  And wrap the soul in holy extasy  While round the saphire throne th' ethereal train  Adoring prostrate raise the lofty strain  I  Arise O Lord arise  In all thy awful glory stand confest  In thee for ever blest  Behold thy servants veil their dazzled eyes  Night hath for thee no shades  Alike to thee appears the orient day  While one vast light one inexhausted ray  Of thy effulgent power the whole pervades  Then whither shall we stray  Where of thy forming hand no trace is found  Above beneath around  The mighty voice is heard  Where'er the hills are rear'd  Where spreads the vaulted sky  Or foams the deep profound  Thro' Nature's utmost bound  To us her works reply  Proclaim a parent God a present Deity  II  Creation's praise is least  Nature's Restorer to preserve is thine  Whose awful voice divine  Created all when Discord heard and ceas'd  For it is thine to bind  The moral chain of Order's perfect law  And to their course the swerving motions draw  Of changeful things and erring human kind  Death with insatiate jaw  Gnash'd oft his iron phang and by his side  Stalking with ample stride  Vice rear'd his giant size  Uptowering to the skies  The mourning earth was waste  Confusion roll'd her tide  When down the Virtues glide  Soft Mercies urg'd their haste  And o'er the bleeding world the sacred mantle cast  III  Beyond created sense  Mysterious goodness hid in deepest night  In vain our feeble sight  Would pierce the gloom O mighty Providence  Where the deep mazes meet  Beneath thy awful throne no eye hath seen  Where wrapt in darkness sits thy power serene  And the loud thunders roll beneath thy feet  O when shall close the scene  And Hope be lost in Truth's wide bursting ray  O haste auspicious day  O haste to light on earth  Great Nature's second birth  New inmate of the skies  When man renew'd shall shine  With innocence divine  And blest Obedience rise  To snatch the palm that crowns her faithful victories  INSCRIPTION UPON A HERMITAGE  BY THE SAME  BENEATH this rural cell  Sweetsmiling Peace and calm Content  Far from the busy crowd sequester'd dwell  Mortal approaching near  The hallow'd seat revere  Nor bring the loud tumultuous Passions here  For not for these is meant  The sacred silence of the stream  Nor cave prophetic prompting Fancy's dream  If with presumption rude  Thy daring steps intrude  Know that with jealous eye  Peace and Content will fly  The thoughtful Genius of the lone abode  And Guardian Spirit of this solemn wood  Will sure revenge the sacrilegious wrong  Reflection's tear will then in secret flow  And all the haunted solitude belong  To Melancholy's train  Who point the sting of pain  With keen remorse and oft redoubled woe  CANZONETTA  BY THE SAME  SOFT slept the sea within its silver bed  To the scarce breathing gale  The silken sail  With venturous hands I spread  And saw the rocks and pass'd yet felt no fear  All danger distant seem'd which was alas too near  Love calm deceiver seated by my side  His secret fraud enjoy'd  Too ost employ'd  In sport my bark to guide  We reach'd the port the little pilot smil'd  Can Love deceive I said and kiss'd the laughing child  He clapp'd his wings and lightly thro' the air  Flew from my longing eyes  The storms arise  And back my vessel bear  Secure what port can hapless lovers meet  We blame the winds and seas yet clasp the dear deceit  THE LOVER AND THE FRIEND  ENDUED with all that could adorn  Or bless thee first and fairest born  A soul that looks superior down  Let giddy Fortune smile or frown  With Age's wisdom not her years  Stella all excellence appears  Then who can blame me if I blend  The name of Lover with the Friend  Like Noah's dove my busy breast  Has rov'd to find a place of rest  Some faithful bosom to repose  And hush the family of woes  Then do I dream or have I found  The fair and hospitable ground  Ah quit your sex's rules and lend  A Lover's wishes to the Friend  Absence I try'dbut try'd in vain  It heals not but upbraids my pain  For thee I'd bear the reaper's toil  For thee consume the midnight oil  Then to your judgment wou'd I owe  All that I read and write and know  Can those who wish like me pretend  To part the Lover and the Friend  Come then and let us dare to prove  Disinterested sweets of Love  For generous Love no dwelling finds  In poor and mercenary minds  Laugh at Life's idle fiuttering things  Look down with pity upon kings  Careless who like or discommend  Blest in the Lover and the Friend  Oh come and we'll together haste  O'er Life's uncomfortable waste  Bear the sharp thorn to find the rose  And smile at transitory woes  Keep the bright goal of Hope in view  Nor look behind as others do  'Till death and only death shall end  At once the Lover and the Friend  THE ENTHUSIAST AN ODE  BY WM WHITEHEAD ESQ  ONCE I remember well the day  'Twas ere the blooming sweets of May  Had lost their freshest hues  When every flower on every hill  In every vale had drank its fill  Of sunshine and of dews  In short 'twas that sweet season's prime  When Spring gives up the reins of Time  To Summer's glowing hand  And doubting mortals hardly know  By whose command the breezes blow  Which fan the smiling land  'Twas then beside a greenwood shade  Which cloath'd a lawn's aspiring head  I urg'd my devious way  With loitering steps regardless where  So soft so genial was the air  So wonderous bright the day  And now my eyes with transport rove  O'er all the blue expanse above  Unbroken by a cloud  And now beneath delighted pass  Where winding thro' the deepgreen grass  A fullbrim'd river flow'd  I stop I gaze in accents rude  To thee serenest Solitude  Burst forth th' unbidden lay  " Begone vile world the learn'd the wise  The great the busy I despise  And pity e'en the gay  These these are joys alone I cry  'Tis here divine Philosophy  Thou deign'st to fix thy throne  Here Contemplation points the road  Thro' Nature's charms to Nature's God  These these are joys alone  Adieu ye vain lowthoughted cares  Ye human hopes and human fears  Ye pleasures and ye pains"  While thus I spake o'er all my soul  A philosophic calmness stole  A stoic stillness reigns  The tyrant passions all subside  Fear anger pity shame and pride  No more my bosom move  Yet still I felt or seem'd to feel  A kind of visionary zeal  Of universal love  When lo a voice a voice I hear  'Twas Reason whisper'd in my ear  These monitory strains  What mean'st thou man would'st thou unbind  The ties which constitute thy kind  The pleasures and the pains  The same Almighty Power unseen  Who spreads the gay or solemn scene  To Contemplation's eye  Fix'd every movement of the soul  Taught every wish its destin'd goal  And quicken'd every joy  He bids the tyrant passions rage  He bids them war eternal wage  And combat each his foe  Till from dissensions concords rise  And beauties from deformities  And happiness from woe  Art thou not man and dar'st thou find  A bliss which leans not to mankind  Presumptuous thought and vain  Each bliss unshar'd is unenjoy'd  Each power is weak unless employ'd  Some social good to gain  Shall light and shade and warmth and air  With those exalted joys compare  Which active Virtue feels  When on she drags as lawful prize  Contempt and Indolence and Vice  At her triumphant wheels  As rest to labour still succeeds  To man whilst Virtue's glorious deeds  Employ his toilsome day  This fair variety of things  Are merely Life's refreshing springs  To sooth him on his way  Enthusiast go unstring thy lyre  In vain thou sing'st if none admire  How sweet soe'er the strain  And is not thy o'erflowing mind  Unless thou mixest with thy kind  Benevolent in vain  Enthusiast go try every sense  If not thy bliss thy excellence  Thou yet hast learn'd to scan  At least thy wants thy weakness know  And see them all uniting show  That man was made for man"  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME  INDEX TO THE SECOND VOLUME  ORIENTAL Eclogues  By Mr Collins  Eclogue I Selim or the
