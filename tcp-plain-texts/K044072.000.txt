 REMARKS ON THE SPEECH of M DUPONT MADE IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF FRANCE ON THE SUBJECTS OF Religion and Public Education  By HANNAH MORE  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND  M DCC XCIII  Price Two Shillings and Sixpence  ☞ The Profits of this Publication are to be given to the  FRENCH EMIGRANT CLERGY  {inverted ⁂} It is hoped the high Price of this Pamphlet will be excused in consideration of the Object to which it is dedicated  A Prefatory Address TO THE LADIES c of GREAT BRITAIN IN BEHALF OF THE FRENCH EMIGRANT CLERGY  IF it be allowed that there may arise occasions so extraordinary that all the lesser motives of delicacy ought to vanish before them it is presumed that the present emergency will in some measure justify the hardiness of an Address from a private individual who stimulated by the urgency of the case sacrifices inferior considerations  to the ardent desire of raising further supplies towards relieving a distress as pressing as it is unexampled  We are informed by public advertisement that the large sums already so liberally subscribed for the Emigrant Clergy are almost exhausted Authentic information adds that multitudes of distressed Exiles in the island of Jersey are on the point of wanting bread  Very many to whom this Address is made have already contributed O let them not be weary in welldoing Many are making generous exertions for the just and natural claims of the widows and children of our brave seamen and soldiers Let it not be said that the present is an  interfering  claim Those to whom I write have bread enough and to spare You who fare sumptuously every day and yet complain you have little to bestow let not this bounty be  subracted from another bounty but rather from some superfluous expence  The beneficent and rightminded want no arguments to be pressed upon them but I write to those of every description Luxurious habits of living which really furnish the distressed with the fairest grounds for application are too often urged as a motive for withholding assistance and produced as a plea for having little to spare Let her who indulges such habits and pleads such excuses in consequence reflect that by retrenching  one  costly dish from her abundant table the superfluities of  one  expensive desert  one  evening's public amusement she may furnish at least a week's subsistence to more than one person  Mr Bowdler's letter states that about Six Shillings a week includes the expences of each Priest at Winchester  as liberally bred perhaps as herself and who  in his own country may have often tasted how much more blessed it is to give than to receive to a minister of God who has been long accustomed to bestow the nccessaries he is now reduced to solicit  Even your young daughters whom maternal prudence has not yet furnished with the means of bestowing may be cheaply taught the first rudiments of charity together with an important lesson of oeconomy they may be taught to sacrifice a feather a set of ribbons an expensive ornament an idle diversion And if they are thus instructed that there is no true charity without selfdenial they will  gain  more than they are called upon to  give  for the suppression of one luxury for a charitable purpose is the exercise of two virtues and this without any pecuniary expence  Let the sick and afflicted remember how dreadful it must be to be exposed to sufferings without one of the alleviations which mitigate  their  affliction How dreadful it is to be without comforts without necessaries without a home  without a country  While the gay and prosperous would do well to recollect how suddenly and terribly those for whom we plead were by the surprising vicissitudes of life thrown from equal heights of gaiety and prosperity And let those who have husbands fathers sons brothers or friends reflect on the uncertainties of war and the revolution of human affairs It is only by imagining the possibility of those who are dear to us being placed in the same calamitous circumstances that we can obtain an adequate feeling of the woes we are called upon to commiserate  In a distress so wide and comprehensive many are prevented from giving by that  common excuse "That it is but a drop of water in the ocean" But let them reflect that if all the individual drops were withheld there would be no ocean at all and the inability to give much ought not on any occasion to be converted into an excuse for giving nothing Even moderate circumstances need not plead an exemption The industrious tradesman will not even in a political view be eventually a loser by his small contribution The money raised is neither carried out of our country nor dissipated in luxuries but returns again to the community to our shops and to our markets to procure the bare necessaries of life  Some have objected to the difference of  religion  of those for whom we solicit Such an objection hardly deserves a serious answer Surely if the superstitious Tartar hopes to become possessed of the courage and talents of the enemy he slays the  Christian is not afraid of catching or of propagating the error of the sufferer he relievesChristian charity is of no party We plead not for their faith but for their wants And let the more scrupulous who look for desert as well as distress in the objects of their bounty bear in mind that if these men could have sacrificed their conscience to their convenience they had not now been in this country Let us shew them the purity of  our  religion by the benesicence of our actions  If you will permit me to press upon you such high motives and it were to be wished that in every action we were to be influenced by the highest perhaps no act of bounty to which you may be called out can ever come so

following is an exact Translation from a  SPEECH  made in the National Convention at Paris on Friday the th of December in a Debate on the Subject of establishing Public Schools for the Education of Youth by Citizen  DUPONT  a Member of considerable Weight and as the Doctrines contained in it were received with unanimous Applause except from two or three of the Clergy it may be fairly considered as an Exposition of the Creed of that Enlightened Assembly Translated from  Le Moniteur  of Sunday the th of December  WHAT Thrones are overturned Sceptres broken Kings expire And yet the Altars of GOD remain Here there is a murmur from some Members and the Abbé ICHON demands that the person speaking may be called to order  Tyrants in outrage to nature continue to burn an impious incense on those Altars Some murmurs arise but they are lost in the applauses from the majority of the Assembly The Thrones that have been reversed have left these Altars naked unsupported and tottering A single breath of enlightened reason will now be sufficient to make them disappear and if humanity is under obligations to the French nation for the first of these benefits the fall of Kings can it be doubted but that the French people now sovereign will be wise enough in like manner to overthrow those Altars and  those Idols  to which those Kings have hitherto made them subject  Nature  and  Reason  these ought to be the gods of men These are my gods Here the Abbé AUDREIN cried out "There is no bearing this" and rushed out of the AssemblyA great laugh Admire  nature  cultivate  reason  And you Legislators if you desire that the French people should be happy  make haste to propagate these principles and to teach them in your primary schools instead of those fanatical principles which have hitherto been taught The tyranny of Kings was confined to make their people miserable in this lifebut those other tyrants the Priests extend their dominion into another of which they have no other idea than of eternal punishments a doctrine which some men have hitherto had the good nature to believe But the moment of the catastrophe is comeall these prejudices must fall at the same time  We must destroy them or they will destroy us  For myself I honestly avow to the Convention  I am an atheist  Here there is some noise and tumult But a great number of members cry out  What is that to usyou are an honest man  But I defy a single individual amongst the twentyfour millions of Frenchmen to make against me any wellgrounded reproach I doubt whether the Christians  or the Catholics of which the last speaker and those of his opinion have been talking to us can make the same challenge Great applauses There is another considerationParis has had great losses It has been deprived of the commerce of luxury of that factitious splendour which was found at courts and invited strangers hither Well We must repair these losses Let me then represent to you the times that are fast approaching when our philosophers whose names are celebrated throughout Europe PETION SYEYES CONDORCET and otherssurrounded in our Pantheon as the Greek philosophers were at Athens with a crowd of disciples coming from all parts of Europe walking like the Peripatetics and teachingthis man the system of the universe and developing the progress of all human knowledge that perfectioning the social system and shewing in our decree of the Ith of June the seeds of the insurrections  of the th of July and the th of August and of all those insurrections which are spreading with such rapidity throughout Europeso that these young strangers on their return to their respective countries may spread the same lights and may operate  for the happiness of mankind  similar revolutions throughout the world  Numberless applauses arose almost throughout the whole Assembly and in the Galleries  REMARKS ON THE SPEECH of Mr DUPONT ON THE SUBJECTS OF Religion and Public Education  IT is presumed that it may not be thought unseasonable at this critical time to offer to the Public and especially to the more religious part of it a few slight observations occasioned by the late famous Speech of Mr Dupont which exhibits the Confession of Faith of a considerable Member of the French National Convention Though  the Speech itself has been pretty generally read yet it was thought necessary to prefix it to these Remarks lest such as have not already perused it might from an honest reluctance to credit the existence of such principles dispute its authenticity and accuse the Remarks if unaccompanied by the Speech of a spirit of invective and unfair exaggeration At the same time it must be confessed that its impiety is so monstrous that many good men were of opinion it ought not to be made familiar to the minds of Englishmen for there are crimes with which even the imagination should never come in contact  But as an ancient nation intoxicated their slaves and then exposed them before their children in order to increase their horror of intemperance so it is hoped that this piece of impiety may be placed in such a light before the eyes of the Christian reader that in proportion as his detestation is  raised his faith instead of being shaken will be only so much the more strengthened  This celebrated Speech though delivered in an assembly of Politicians is not on a question of politics but on one as superior as the soul is to the body and eternity to time The object here is not to dethrone kings but HIM by whom kings reign It does not here excite the cry of indignation that  Louis  reigns but that  the Lord God omnipotent reigneth  Nor is this the declaration of some obscure and anonymous person but an exposition of the Creed of a public Leader It is not a sentiment hinted in a journal hazarded in a pamphlet or thrown out at a disputing club but it is the implied faith of the rulers of a great nation  Little notice would have been due to this famous Speech if it had conveyed the sentiments  of only  one  vain orator but it should be observed that it was heard received  applauded  with two or three exceptions onlya fact which you who have scarcely believed in the existence of atheism will hardly credit and which for the honour of the eighteenth century it is hoped that our posterity being still more unacquainted with such corrupt opinions will reject as totally incredible  A love of liberty generous in its principle inclines some good men still to favour the proceedings of the National Convention of France They do not yet perceive that the licentious wildness which has been excited in that country is destructive of all true happiness and no more resembles liberty than the tumultuous joys of the drunkard resemble the cheerfulness of a sober and wellregulated mind  To those who do not know of what strange inconsistencies man is made up  who have not considered how some persons having at first been hastily and heedlessly drawn in as approvers by a sort of natural progression soon become principals to those who have never observed by what a variety of strange associations in the mind opinions that seem the most irreconcilable meet at some unsuspected turning and come to be united in the same man to all such it may appear quite incredible that wellmeaning and even pious people should continue to applaud the principles of a set of men who have publicly made known their intention of abolishing Christianity as far as the demolition of altars priests temples and institutions  can  abolish it and as to the religion itself this also they may traduce and for their own part reject but we know from the comfortable promise of an authority still sacred in this country at least that  the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  Let me not be misunderstood by those to whom these slight remarks are principally addressed that class of wellintentioned people who favour at least if they do not adopt the prevailing sentiments of the new Republic You are not here accused of being the wilful abettors of infidelity God forbid  we are persuaded better things of you and things which accompany salvation  But this  ignis fatuus  of liberty and universal brotherhood which the French are madly pursuing with the insignia of freedom in one hand and the bloody bayonet in the other has bewitched your senses and is in danger of misleading your steps You are gazing at a meteor raised by the vapours of vanity which these wild and infatuated wanderers are pursuing to their destruction and though for a moment you mistake it for a heavenborn light which leads to the perfection of human freedom you will should you join in the mad pursuit soon discover that  it will conduct you over dreary wilds and sinking bogs only to plunge you in deep and inevitable ruin  Much very much is to be said in vindication of your favouring in the first instance their political projects The cause they took in hand seemed to be the great cause of human kind Its very name insured its popularity What English heart did not exult at the demolition of the Bastile What lover of his species did not triumph in the warm hope that one of the finest countries in the world would soon be one of the most free Popery and despotism though chained by the gentle influence of Louis the sixteenth had actually slain their thousands Little was it then imagined that anarchy and atheism the monsters who were about to succeed them would soon slay their ten thousands If we cannot regret the defeat of the two former tyrants what must they be who can triumph in the mischiefs of the two latter Who I say that had a head to reason or a heart to  feel did not glow with the hope that from the ruins of tyranny and the rubbish of popery a beautiful and finelyframed edifice would in time have been constructed and that ours would not have been the only country in which the patriots' fair idea of wellunderstood liberty and of the most pure and reasonable as well as the most sublime and exalted Christianity might be realized  But alas it frequently happens that the wise and good are not the most adventurous in attacking the mischiefs which they perceive and lament With a timidity in some respects virtuous they fear attempting any thing which may possibly aggravate the evils they deplore or put to hazard the blessings they already enjoy They dread plucking up the wheat with the tares and are rather apt with a spirit of hopeless resignation  To bear the ills they have  Than fly to others that they know not of  While soberminded and considerate men therefore sat mourning over this complicated mass of error and waited till God in his own good time should open the blind eyes the vast scheme of reformation was left to that set of rash and presumptuous adventurers who are generally watching how they may convert public grievances to their own personal account It was undertaken not upon the broad basis of a wise and welldigested scheme of which all the parts should contribute to the perfection of one consistent whole it was carried on not by those steady measures founded on rational deliberation which are calculated to accomplish so important an end not with a temperance which indicated a sober love of law or a sacred regard for religion but with the most extravagant lust of power and the most inordinate vanity which perhaps ever instigated human measures a lust of power which threatens to extend its defolating  solating influence over the whole globea vanity of the same destructive species with that which stimulated the celebrated incendiary of Ephesus who being weary of his native obscurity and insignificance and preferring infamy to oblivion could contrive no other road to fame and immortality than that of setting fire to the exquisite Temple of Diana He  was  remembered indeed as he desired to be but only to be execrated while the seventh wonder of the world lay prostrate through his crime  It is the same overruling vanity which operates in their politics and in their religion which makes Kersaint  See his Speech enumerating their intended projects  boast of carrying his destructive projects from the Tagus to the Brazils and from Mexico to the shores of the Ganges which makes him menace to outstrip the enterprizes of the most extravagant hero of romance  and almost undertake with the marvellous celerity of the nimblefooted Puck  To put a girdle round about the earth  In forty minutes  It is the same vanity still the masterpassion in the bosom of a Frenchman which leads Dupont and Manuel to undertake in their orations to abolish the Sabbath exterminate the Priesthood erect a Pantheon for the World restore the Peripatetic Philosophy and in short revive every thing of ancient Greece except the pure taste the wisdom the love of virtue the veneration of the laws and that degree of reverence which even virtuous Pagans professed for the Deity  It is surely to be charged to the inadequate and wretched hands into which the work of reformation fell and not to the impossibility of amending the civil and religious  institutions of France that all has succeeded so ill It cannot be denied perhaps that a reforming spirit was wanted in that country their government was not more despotic than their church was superstitious and corrupt  But though this is readily granted and though it may be unfair to blame those who in the  first outset  of the French Revolution rejoiced even on religious motives yet it is astonishing how any pious person even with all the blinding power of prejudice can think without horror of the  present  state of France It is no less wonderful how any rational man could even in the beginning of the Revolution transfer that reasoning however just it might be when applied to France to the case of England For what can be more unreasonable than to draw from different and even opposite premises the same conclusion Must a revolution  be equally necessary in the case of two sorts of Government and two sorts of Religion which are the very reverse of each otheropposite in their genius unlike in their fundamental principles and widely different in each of their component parts  That despotism priestcraft intolerance and superstition are terrible evils no candid Christian it is presumed will deny but blessed be God though these mischiefs are not yet entirely banished from the face of the earth they have scarcely any existence in this country  To guard against a real danger and to cure actual abuses of which the existence has been first plainly proved by the application of a suitable remedy requires diligence as well as courage observation as well as genius patience and temperance as well as zeal and spirit It requires the union  of that clear head and sound heart which constitute the true patriot But to conjure up fancied evils or even greatly to aggravate real ones and then to exhaust our labour in combating them is the characteristic of a distempered imagination and an ungoverned spirit  Romantic crusades the ordeal trial drowning of witches the torture and the Inquisition have been justly reprobated as the foulest stain of the respective periods in which to the disgrace of human reason they existed but would any man be rationally employed who should now stand up gravely to declaim against these as the predominating mischiefs of the present century Even the whimsical Knight of La Mancha himself would not fight windmills that were pulled down yet I will venture to say that the abovenamed evils are at present little more chimerical than some of those now so bitterly complained of among  us It is not as Dryden said when one of his works was unmercifully abused that the piece has not faults enough in it but the critics have not had the wit to fix upon the right ones  It is allowed that as a Nation we have faults enough but our political critics err in the objects of their censure They say little of those real and pressing evils resulting from our own corruption which constitute the actual miseries of life while they gloomily speculate upon a thousand imaginary political grievances and fancy that the reformation of our rulers and our legislators is all that is wanting to make us a happy people  The principles of just and equitable government were perhaps never more fully established nor public justice more exactly administered Pure and undefiled religion was never laid more open to all  than at this day I wish I could say we were a religious people but this at least may be safely asserted that the great truths of religion were never better understood that Christianity was never more completely stripped from all its incumbrances and disguises or more thoroughly purged from human infusions and whatever is debasing in human institutions  In vain we look around us to discover the ravages of religious tyranny or the triumphs of priestcraft or superstition Who attempts to impose any yoke upon our reason Who seeks to put any blind on the eyes of the most illiterate Who fetters the judgment or enslaves the conscience of the meanest of our Protestant brethren Nay such is the power of pure Christianity to enlighten the understanding as well as to reform the heart and such are the advantages which the most abject in this country possess for enjoying its privileges that the poorest  peasant among us if he be as religious as multitudes of his station really are has clearer ideas of God and his own soul purer notions of that true liberty wherewith Christ has made him free than the mere disputer of this world though he possess every splendid advantage which education wisdom and genius can bestow I am not speaking either of a perfect form of Government or a perfect Church Establishment because I am speaking of Institutions which are human and the very idea of their being human involves also the idea of imperfection But I am speaking of the best constituted Government and the best constituted National Church with which we are yet acquainted Time that silent instructor and Experience that great rectifier of the judgment will more and more discover to us what is wanting to the perfection of both And if we may trust to the active genius of Christian Liberty and  to that liberal and candid spirit which is the characteristic of the age we live in there is little doubt but that a temperate and wellregulated zeal will at a convenient season correct whatsoever sound policy shall suggest as wise and expedient  If there are errors in the Church and it does not perhaps require the sharpsightedness of a keen opposer to discover that there are there is at least nothing like fierce intolerance or spiritual usurpation A fiery zeal and an uncharitable bigotry might have furnishied matter for a welldeserved ecclesiastical philippic in other times but thanks to the temper of the present day unless we conjure up a spirit of religious chivalry and sally forth in quest of imaginary evils we shall not apprehend any danger from persecution or enthusiasm If grievances there are they do not appear to be those which  result from polemic pride and rigid bigotry but are of a kind far different  If the warm sun of prosperity has unhappily produced its too common effect in relaxing the vigour of religious exertion if in too many instances security has engendered sloth and affluence produced dissipation let us implore the Divine grace that the present alarming crisis may rouse the careless and quicken the supine that our pastors may be convinced that the Church has less to fear from external violence than from internal decay nay that even the violence of attack is often really beneficial by exciting that activity which enables us to repel danger since increase of diligence is the truest accession of strength that the love of power with which their enemies perhaps unjustly accuse them is not more fatal than the love of pleasure that no degree of orthodoxy in opinion can atone for a too close assimilation  with the manners of the world that heresy without is less to be dreaded than indifference from within that the most regular clerical education the most scrupulous attention to forms and even the strictest conformity to the established opinions of the Church will avail but little to the enlargement of Christ's kingdom without a strict spirit of personal watchfulness habitual selfdenial and laborious exertion  Though it is not here intended to animadvert on any political complaint which is not in some sort connected with religion yet it is presumed it may not be thought quite foreign to the present purpose to remark that among the reigning complaints against our civil administration the most plausible seems to be that excited by the supposed danger of an invasion on the Liberty of the Press Were this apprehension wellfounded we should indeed be threatened by one of the most grievous misfortunes that can  befal a free country It is not only a most noble privilege itself but the guardian of all our other liberties and notwithstanding the abuse which has lately been made of this valuable possession yet every man of a sound unprejudiced mind is well aware that true liberty of every kind is scarcely inferior in importance to any object for which human activity can contend Nay the very abuse of a good often makes us more sensible of its value Fair and wellproportioned Freedom will ever retain all her native beauty to a judicious eye nor will her genuine form be the less prized for our having lately contemplated the distorted features and false colouring of her caricature as presented to us by the daubing hand of Gallic patriots  But highly as the Freedom of the Press ought to be valued would it really be so very heavy a misfortune if corrupt and inflaming publications calculated to destroy  that peace which every good man is anxious to preserve should just at this alarming period be somewhat difficult to be obtained Would it be so very grievous a national calamity if the crooked progeny of treason and blasphemy should find it a little inconvenient to venture forth from their lurkingholes and range abroad in open day Is the cheapness of poison or the facility with which it may be obtained to be reckoned among the real advantages of medicinal repositories And can the easiness of access to seditious or atheistical writings be numbered among the substantial blessings of any country Would France at this day have had much solid cause of regret if many of the writings of Voltaire Rousseau and d'Alembert the prolific seed of their widespreading tree had found more difficulty in getting into the world or been less profusely circulated when in it And might not England at this moment have been just as happy in her  ignorance if the famous orations of Citizen Dupont and Citizen Manuel had been confined to their own enlightened and philosophical countries  Extract from Mons Manuel's Letter to the National Convention dated January  "The priests of a republic are its magistrates the law its gospel What mission can be more august than that of the instructors of youth who having themselves escaped from the hereditary prejudice of all sects point out to the human race their inalienable rights founded upon that sublime wisdom which pervades all nature Religious faith impressed on the mind of an infant seven years old will lead to perfect slavery for dogmas at that age are only arbitrary commands Ah what is belief without examination without conviction It renders men either melancholy or mad c  "Legislators Virtue wants neither temples nor synagogues It is not from priests we learn to do good or noble actions No religion must be taught in schools which are to be national ones To prescribe one would be to prefer it to all others There history must speak of sect as she speaks of other events It would become your wisdom perhaps to order that the pupils of the republic should not enter the temples before the age of seventeen Reason must not be taken by surprise c Hardly were children born before they fell into the hands of priests who first blinded their eyes and then delivered them over to kings Wherever kings cease to govern priests must cease to educate"    To return to these orationsWe have too often in our own nation seen and deplored the mischiefs of irreligion arising incidentally from a neglected or an abused education But what mischiefs will not irreligion produce when in the projected schools of France as announced to us by the two metaphysical legislators abovementioned impiety shall be taught by system When out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the monstrous opinions exhibited by Dupont and Manuel shall be perfected When the fruits of atheism dropping from their newlyplanted tree of liberty shall pollute the very fountains of knowledge When education being poisoned in all her springs the rising generation will be taught to look on atheism as decorous and religion as eccentric When atheism shall be considered as a proof of accomplished breeding and religion as the stamp of a vulgar education When the regular course of obedience  to masters and tutors will be to renounce the hope of everlasting happiness and to deride the idea of future punishment When every man and every child in conformity with the principles professed in the Convention shall presume to say with his tongue what hitherto even the fool has only dared to say in his heart  That there is no God  It is a remarkable circumstance that though the French are continually binding themselves by oaths they have not mentioned the name of GOD in any oath which has been invented since the revolution It may also appear curious to the English reader that though in almost all the addresses of congratulation which were sent by the associated clubs from this country to the National Convention the success of the French arms was in part ascribed to Divine Providence yet in none of the answers was the least notice ever taken of this And to shew how the same spirit spreads itself among every description of men in France their Admiral Latouche after having described the dangers to which his ship was exposed in a storm says  we owe our existence to the tutelary Genius which watches over the destiny of the French republic and the defenders of liberty and equality    My fellow Christians This is not a strife of words this is not a controversy about opinions of comparatively small importance such as you have been accustomed at home to hear even good men dispute upon when perhaps they would have acted a more wise and amiable part had they remained silent sacrificing their mutual differences on the altar of Christian charity But this bold renunciation of the first great fundamental article of faith this daring rejection of the Supreme Creator and Ruler of the World is striking with a vigorous stroke at the root of all human happiness It is tearing up the very foundation of human hope and extirpating every true principle of human excellence It is annihilating the very existence of virtue by annihilating its motives its sanctions its obligations and its end  That atheism will be the favoured and the popular tenet in France seems highly probable  whilst in that wild contempt of all religion which has lately had the arrogance to call itself toleration it is not improbable that Christianity itself may be tolerated in that country as a sect not persecuted indeed but derided It is however far from clear that this will be the case if the new doctrines should become generally prevalent although the great apostles of infidelity Voltaire and his disciples have employed all the acuteness of their wit to convince us that irreligion never persecutes To prove this every art of false citation partial extract suppressed evidence and gross misrepresentation has been put in practice But if this unsupported assertion were true then Polycarp Ignatius Justin Cyprian and Basil did not suffer for the faith once delivered to the Saints Then the famous Christian apologists most of them learned converts from the pagan philosophy idly employed their zeal to abate a clamour which did not exist and  and to propitiate emperors who did not persecute Then Tacitus Trajan Pliny and Julian those bitter enemies to Christianity are suborned witnesses on her side Then Ecclesiastical History is a series of falsehoods and the Book of Martyrs a legend of romance  It may be objected here that this is not applicable to the state of France for that the Roman Emperors were not atheists or deists but polytheists with an established religion To this it may be answered that modern infidels not only deny the ten pagan persecutions but accuse Christianity of being the only persecuting religion and affirm that only those who refuse to embrace it discover a spirit of toleration    That one extravagant mischief should produce its opposite is agreeable to the ordinary course of human events That to the credulity of a dark and superstitious religion a wanton contempt of all decency and an unbridled prophaneness should succeed that to a government absolutely  despotic an utter abhorrence of all restraint and subordination should follow though it is deplorable yet it is not strange The human mind in flying from the extreme verge of one error seldom stops till she has reached the opposite extremity She generally passes by with a lofty disdain the obvious truth which lies directly in her road and which is indeed commonly to be found in the midway between the error she is flying from and the error she is pursuing  Is it a breach of Christian charity to conclude from a view of the present state of the French that since that deluded people have given up GOD GOD by a righteous retribution seems to have renounced them for a time and to have given them over to their own hearts lusts  to work iniquity with greediness  If such is their present  career what is likely to be their appointed end How fearfully applicable to them seems that awful denunciation against an ancient offending people  The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart  It is no part of the present design to enter into a detail of their political conduct but I cannot omit to remark that the very man in their long list of kings who seemed best to have deserved their assumed appellation of  most Christian  was also most favourable to their acquisition of liberty  Of this the French themselves were so well persuaded that the title of  Restorateur de la Libertè Françoise  was solemnly given to Louis the XVIth by the Constituent Assembly  his moderation and humanity facilitated their power which with unparalleled ingratitude they employed to degrade his person and character in the eyes of mankind  by the blackest and most detestable arts and at length to terminate his calamities by a crime which has excited the grief and indignation of all Europe  On the trial and murder of that most unfortunate king and on the inhuman proceedings which accompanied them I shall purposely avoid dwelling for it is not the design of these remarks to excite the passions I will only say that so monstrous has been the inversion of all order law humanity justice received opinion good faith and religion that the conduct of his bloody executioners seems to have exhibited the most scrupulous conformity with the principles announced in the speeches we have been considering In this one instance we must not call the French an inconsequent people Savage brutality treason and murder have been the noxious fruit gathered from these thorns the baneful produce  of these thistles An overturn of all morals has been the wellproportioned offspring of an inversion of all principle  But notwithstanding the consistency in this instance between cause and consequence so new and surprising have been the turns in their extraordinary projects that to foretel what their next enterprise would be from what their last has been has long baffled all calculation and bid defiance to all conjecture Analogy from history a study of past events and an investigation of present principles and passions judgment memory and deduction afford human sagacity but very slender assistance in its endeavours to develope their future plans We have not even the data of consistent wickedness on which to build rational conclusions Their crimes though visibly connected by uniform depravity are yet so surprisingly diversified by interfering  absurdities as to furnish no ground on which reasonable argument can be founded Nay such is their incredible eccentricity that it is hardly extravagant to affirm that improbability is become rather an additional reason for expecting such an event to take place  But let us in this yet happy country learn at least one great and important truth from the errors of this distracted people Their conduct has awfully illustrated a position which is not the less sound for having been often controverted That no degree of wit and learning no progress in commerce no advances in the knowledge of nature or in the embellishments of art can ever thoroughly tame that savage the natural human heart without RELIGION The arts of social life may give a sweetness  to the manners and language and induce in some degree a love of justice truth and humanity but attainments derived from such inferior causes are no more than the semblance and the shadow of the qualities derived from pure Christianity Varnish is an extraneous ornament but true polish is a proof of the solidity of the body it depends greatly on the nature of the substance is not superinduced by accidental causes but in a good measure proceeding from internal soundness  The poets of that country whose style sentiments manners and religion the French so affectedly labour to imitate have left keen and biting satires on the Roman vices Against the late proceedings in France no satirist need employ his pen that of the historian will be quite sufficient Fact will put fable out of countenance and the crimes which are usually held up to our  abhorrence in works of invention will be regarded as flat and feeble by those who shall peruse the records of the tenth of August of the second and third of September and of the twentyfirst of January  If the same astonishing degeneracy in taste principle and practice should ever come to flourish among  us  Britons may still live to exult in the desolation of her cities and in the destruction of her finest monuments of art she may triumph in the peopling of the fortresses of her rocks and her forests may exult in being once more restored to that glorious state of  liberty and equality  when all subsisted by rapine and the chace when all O enviable privilege were equally savage equally indigent and equally naked may extol it as the restoration of reason and the triumph of nature that they are again brought to feed on acorns instead of bread Groves of consecrated  misletoe may happily succeed to useless corn fields and Thor and Woden may hope once more to be invested with all their bloody honours  Let not any serious readers feel indignation as if pains were ungenerously taken to involve their religious with their political opinions Far be it from me to wound unnecessarily the feelings of people whom I so sincerely esteem but it is much to be suspected that certain opinions in politics have a tendency to lead to certain opinions in religion Where so much is at stake they will do well to keep their consciences tender in order to which they should try to keep their discernment acute They will do well to observe that the same restless spirit of innovation is busily operating under various though seemingly unconnected forms To observe that the same impatience of restraint the same contempt of order peace and subordination which makes  makes men bad citizens makes them bad Christians and that to this secret but almost infallible connexion between religious and political sentiment does France owe her present unparalleled anarchy and impiety  There are doubtless in that unhappy country multitudes of virtuous and reasonable men who rather silently acquiesce in the authority of their present turbulent government than embrace its principles or promote its projects from the sober conviction of their own judgment These together with those conscientious exiles whom this nation so honourably protects may yet live to rejoice in the restoration of true liberty and solid peace to their native country when light and order shall spring from the present darkness and confusion and the reign of chaos shall be no more  May I be permitted a short digression on the subject of these exiles It shall only be  to remark that all the boasted conquests of our Edwards and our Henrys over the French nation do not confer such substantial glory on our own country as she derives from having received protected and supported among multitudes of other sufferers at a time and under circumstances so peculiarly disadvantageous to herself  three thousand priests  of a nation habitually her enemy and of a religion intolerant and hostile to her own This is the solid triumph of true Christianity and it is worth remarking that the deeds which poets and historians celebrate as rare and splendid actions and sublime instances of greatness of soul in the heroes of the Pagan world are but the ordinary and habitual virtues which occur in the common course of action among Christians quietly performed without effort or exertion and with no view to renown but resulting naturally and necessarily from the religion they profess  So predominating is the power of an example we have once admired and set up as a standard of imitation and so fascinating has been the ascendancy of the Convention over the minds of those whose approbation of French politics commenced in the earlier periods of the Revolution that it extends to the most trivial circumstances I cannot forbear to notice this in an instance which though inconsiderable in itself yet ceases to be so when we view it in the light of a symptom of the reigning disease  While the fantastic phraseology of the new Republic is such as to be almost as disgusting to sound taste as their doctrines are to sound morals it is curious to observe how deeply the addresses which have been sent to it from the Clubs  See the Collection of Addresses from England  in this country  have been infected with it as far at least as phrases and terms are objects of imitation In other respects it is but justice to the French Convention to confess that they are hitherto without rivals and without imitators for who can aspire to emulate that compound of anarchy and atheism which in their debates is mixed up with the pedantry of schoolboys the jargon of a cabal and the vulgarity and illbreeding of a mob One instance of the prevailing cant may suffice where an hundred might be adduced and it is not the most exceptionableTo demolish every existing law and establishment to destroy the fortunes and ruin the principles of every country into which they are carrying their destructive arms and their frantic doctrines to untie or cut asunder every bond which holds society together to impose their own arbitrary shackles where they succeed and to demolish every thing where they failThis desolating system  by a most unaccountable perversion of language they are pleased to call by the endearing name of  fraternization  and fraternization is one of the favourite terms which their admirers have adopted Little would a simple stranger uninitiated in this new and surprising dialect imagine that the peaceful terms of fellowcitizen and of brother the winning offer of freedom and happiness and the warm embrace of fraternity were only watchwords by which they in effect  Cry havoc  And let slip the dogs of war  In numberless other instances the fashionable language of France at this day would be as unintelligible to the correct writers of the age of Louis the XIVth as their fashionable notions of liberty would be irreconcileable with those of the true Revolution Patriots  of his great contemporary and victorious rival William the Third  Such is indeed their puerile rage for novelty in the invention of new words and the perversion of their taste in the use of old ones that the celebrated Vossius whom Christine of Sweden oddly complimented by saying that he was so learned as not only to know whence all words came but whither they were going would  were be admitted to the honours of a sitting  be obliged to confess that he was equally puzzled to tell the one or to foretel the other  If it shall please the Almighty in his anger to let loose this infatuated people as a scourge for the iniquities of the human race if they are delegated by infinite justice to act as storm and tempest fulfilling his  word if they are commissioned to perform the errand of the destroying lightning or the avenging thunderbolt let us try at least to extract personal benefit from national calamity let every one of us high and low rich and poor enter upon this serious and humbling inquiry how much his own individual offences have contributed to that awful aggregate of public guilt which has required such a visitation Let us carefully examine in what proportion we have separately added to that common stock of abounding iniquity the description of which formed the character of an ancient nation and is so peculiarly applicable to our own  Pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness  Let every one of us humbly inquire in the selfsuspecting language of the disciples to their Divine Master  Lord is it I  Let us learn to fear the fleets and  armies of the enemy much less than those iniquities at home which this alarming dispensation may be intended to chastize  The war which the French have declared against us is of a kind altogether unexampled in every respect insomuch that human wisdom is baffled when it would pretend to conjecture what may be the event But this at least we may safely say that it is not so much the force of French bayonets as the contamination of French principles that ought to excite our apprehensions We trust that through the blessing of GOD we shall be defended from their open hostilities by the temperate wisdom of our Rulers and the bravery of our fleets and armies but the domestic danger arising from licentious and irreligious principles among ourselves can only be guarded against by the personal care and vigilance of every one of us who  who values religion and the good order of society  GOD grant that those who go forth to fight our battles instead of being intimidated by the number of their enemies may hear in mind that "there is no restraint with GOD to save by many or by few" And let the meanest of us who remains at home remember also that even he may contribute to the internal safety of his country by the integrity of his private life and to the success of her defenders by following them with his fervent prayers And in what war can the sincere Christian ever have stronger inducements to pray for the success of his country than in this Without entering far into any political principles the discussion of which would be in a great measure foreign to the design of this little tract it may be remarked that the unchristian principle of revenge is not our motive to this war conquest is not our object  nor have we had recourse to hostility in order to effect a change in the internal government of France  See the Report of Mr Pitt's Speech in the House of Commons on Feb published by Woodfall  The present war is undoubtedly undertaken entirely on defensive principles It is in defence of our King our Constitution our Religion our Laws and consequently our  Liberty  in the sound and rational sense of that term It is to defend ourselves from the savage violence of a crusade made against all Religion as well as all Government If ever therefore a war was undertaken on the ground of selfdefence and necessityif ever men might be literally said to fight  pro  ARIS  et focis  this seems to be the occasion  The ambition of conquerors has been the source of great and extensive evils religious fanaticism of still greater But little as I am disposed to become the apologist of either  the one principle or the other there is no extravagance in asserting that they have seemed incapable of producing even in ages that extent of mischief that comprehensive desolation which  philosophy falsely so called  has produced in three years  Christians it is not a small thing  it is your life  The pestilence of irreligion which you detest will insinuate itself imperceptibly with those manners phrases and principles which you admire and adopt It is the humble wisdom of a Christian to shrink from the most distant approaches to sin to abstain from the very appearance of evil If we would fly from the deadly contagion of Atheism let us fly from those seemingly remote but not very indirect paths which lead to it Let France chuse this day whom she will serve  but as for us and our houses we will serve the Lord  And O gracious and long suffering God before that awful period arrives which  shall exhibit the dreadful effects of such an education as the French nation are instituting before a race of men can be trained up not only without the knowledge of THEE but in the contempt of THY most holy law do THOU in great mercy change the heart of this people as the heart of one man Give them not finally over to their own corrupt imaginations to their own heart's lusts But after having made them a fearful example to all the nations of the earth what a people  can  do who have cast off the fear of THEE do THOU graciously bring them back to a sense of that law which they have violated and to a participation of that mercy which they have abused so that they may happily find while the discovery can be attended with consolation that  doubtless there is a reward for the righteous verily there is a GOD who judgeth the earth  THE END
