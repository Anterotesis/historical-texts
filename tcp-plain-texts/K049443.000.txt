 CALEDONIA A POEM c  IN Northern Hights where Nature seldom smiles  Embrac'd with Scas and  buttress't  All the Western and Northern parts of  Scotland  are fenc'd with small Islands which not only break off the Force of the  Atlantick Ocean  but make excellent Harbours for Shipping and Conveniencies for Trade  round  with Isles  Where lofty Shores  The Shores to the North of  Scotland  may be said to regard the  adjacent Pole  either because it lies directly open to the Great Northern Ocean which no Sailer could ever yet find the Extent of or because it sees that Pole elevated to a great Height  regard th' adjacent  Pole  Where Winds incessant blow and Waves incessant roll  Where  Tyrant  I  call that continual Cold in the Frozen Seas here  Tyrant Cold  because he reigns Uncontroll'd by the Accession of any Heat from the Sun  Cold  in  Glacy Ocean  reigns  And all the Habitable World disdains  Defies the distant Influence of the Sun  And  Shines in Ice  The Ice and Snow always give a kind of Light tho faint and melancholy  shines in Ice  First  Youngest Sister  because the North Capes and the Coast of  Greenland  to be of the same Family but advanc'd farther North  First  youngest a  Licence taken  to exp  ess  Scotland  the first of the Habitable or at least  Sociable  Parts of the World so far North  youngest Sister  to the Frozen Zone  Batter'd by Parent Natures constant Frown▪  Adapt to Hardships and cut out for Toil  The  best worst Climate  and the  worst best Soil  A rough unhewn uncultivated Spot  Of old  so fam'd  and  so of late  forgot  NEGLECTED SCOTLAND shews her awful Brow  Not always  quite so near  to Heaven as now  Circled with dreadful Clifts and Barb'rous Shores  Where the  strong Surff  with high impetuous Roars  Invades the Rocks and  these their Rage disdain  And with  redoubling  Noise they'r hurry'd home again  The hollow Caverns  Mutual Roars  return  And  Baffled Neptune  The Raging of the Sea will often resemble Fire and seem to burn especially as some say on a Southerly Wind  raging  makes the Ocean burn  The furious Elements in vain contend  Unmov'd  the mighty  natural Breastworks  stand  Their awful Hights in threatning Grandeur shine  Emblems of mightier  Hearts of Stone  within  Th' Instructing Rocks  Invincible and Strong  Describe  the Race  that to  these Rocks  belong  And bid the quick retreating Waves declare  And warn the World  against a Northern War  ▪  Tell them the Hopes of Conquest must be vain  When  Hands of Steel  shall  Rocks of Flint  maintain  The high Shores could be in no place more needful to place Bounds proportion'd to the furious and vast Northern Ocean that beat upon  Scotland▪  from whence there is nothing but Water to the very Frozen Zone of the North Pole Those Rocks therefore are the  Lands Defence  and the  Ocems Bridle  and consequently Beauties in their Kind made so by the Necessity of them  These are  th' eternal Bounds  of  Providence  The  Oceans Bridle  and the  Lands Defence  The  Warts  and  Wrinkles  plac'd on  Natures Brow  That her Maternal Care and Conduct show  The meanest parts of Nature  have their Use  And some to Terror some to Strength conduce  Nor is their Ornament at all the less  For Beauty's best describ'd by Usefulness  Behind this Rugged Front  The Situation of  Scotland  is certainly her Defence against either the Fury of the Ocean from the North or of Invaders from the South the dangerous Coast being such that no Fleets care to venture themselves long at Sea that way  securely lies  Blest Caledonia  and with Ease defies  Her  Northern  or her  Southern  Enemies  Fixt by Decree  Her Nature's not to fear  Huge Navies  there  or Icy Mountains  here  Here Towring Clifts and there the Beachy Shoal  Defy the  By the  Monsters of the Pole  may be understood  the Whales  in former times terrible to Mariners as frequently oversetting the small Barks they sailed in  Or  since by the greater Skill in Navigation that fear is at an end it may be taken for the  Monstruous floating Islands of Ice  which by the Fury of the Winds are driven about the Northern Seas  Raging Monsters  of the Pole  There equally they  Floating Worlds  Navys and Fleets of Ships of War to assault that Country and transport Armys to make Descents and Depredations on the Coast  Floating Worlds  defy  Bid them stand off  and live  advance  and die  The Hardy Wretch that sees the Hint too late  Fails not to find his Folly  in his Fate  Behind this Rugged Front securely lies  Old Caledonia  all the Worlds  The Worlds Surprize to find so fine a Countrey so Peopled and so Inhabited behind such terrible places which to the Seaward promise nothing but Desert and abandon'd uninhabited Places  Surprize  Her Native Beauty and her Wealth conceal'd  Waits  The Ʋnion  whereby Improvement shall reveal the hidden Fruitfulness of  Scotland  the blest Hour  when both shall be reveal'd  In Age and Fancy'd Poverty Secure  And yet She's  ever Young  and  never Poor  Here labouring with the Injuries of Time▪  Inclement Air Inhospitable Clime  Foreign Invasions and Intestine Wars  Yet all her Native Beauty still appears  Brittain  's  Scotland  is allowed the Left hand of  Brittain  as to Wealth  England  as her younger Sister in matter of Antiquity must however be allowed the Right hand in Wealth and Trade at least till Union if ever that shall happen make them all one  Left hand  which when she shall unite  As Nature dictates and the Fates Invite  And join  her younger Sister  on the Right  How shall they Mutual Wealth and Strength convey  And with Contempt  the weaker World  Survey  Till THAT BLEST HOUR how does her Injur'd Name  Sleep in the Rubbish of her Ancient Fame  Buried in  The scandalous Reproaches of Authors pretending to describe either her Climate People or Government have been intollerable and have buried her Character with Noise and Slander which being never yet defended in publick or any Attempt made to clear up those things to the World Foreign Nations are too much possest with the Belief of what when the Truth comes to be examined appears meer Fiction and Falsity  Slander  by Reproach laid low  And all the distant World  believes her so  Then let us first survey her Fancy'd Herse  She'll find  some Resurrection  in our Verse  Till rousing from a long declining Fate  WHOLE BRITTAIN shall her Glory reinstate  How have  Cleavland  in his Poem upon  Scotland  has said a Thousand extravagant things on these Heads  we plac'd her  out of Nature's Eye  Where Constant Colds  Few Seeds  of Life supply  Where  Nature Chill'd  some  despicables  dwell  Immur'd with Darkness  and ally'd to Hell  No Moderate Blessings  no  Endowment share  Nothing that's Pleasant  see  nothing delightful  hear  But see  the Horrid  By  the Horrid Bear  is to be understood the Constellation so call'd which  Scotland  being so far North easily sees in its whole Circular Motion round the Pole  Bear  march round the Pole  And feel her Piercing Breath  Congeal the Soul  Their Musick's  Whirlwind  and the shrill Echoing Roar  Of Frozen Seas on the Deserted Shore  Legends of Fables  fill our partial Heads  Of Lands where Grass ne'r grows  or Mortal treads  Where keenest Winds and Storms Incessant blow  On Mountains cover'd with Eternal Snow  Where Nature never blooms and Sun ne'r shines  But Cold with Cold and Frost with Frost Combines  This is as suggested by Foreign Authors in open Injury of  Scotland  and one of the principal Reasons of this Poem  Inhospitable Clime  What Countrey's this And whither are we gone  Bright  Caledonia  where will Fable run  Suffer th' impartial Pen to range thy Shore  And do thee  'Tis presum'd this Part will clear the Author from a Charge of Flattery he designing to say nothing in this Poem but what Justice and the Nature of things require  Justice Nature asks no more  Fitted for Commerce and cut out for Trade  The Seas the Land the Land the Seas invade  The

Caledonia  to be great  Her  Various Aspects  Respecting the Situation of the Coast or the Plan of the Countrey which easily discovers that  Scotland  is equally qualified for Trade with any Nation in the World whether we consider her Openness to all Parts of the Trading World or the Convenience of her Harbours safe Roads and Neighbourhood both to the  German  and  Atlantick  Oceans  various Aspects  the Design explain  And  Her unhappy Circumstances with respect to the rest of  Brittain  have without doubt been the great Obstructions of her Prosperity particularly as to Trade  Circumstances  shall resist in vain  Subject no more to ev'ry cross Event  She shall  be Great  and  Rich  as Nature meant  View next her Seas  from ancient Terrors nam'd  For  Bugbear  Storms by  Bugbear  Sailors fam'd  The Ancients in their sailing these Seas were strangely surprized at two things The Length of the Days which they being generally  Phenicians  and SouthCountrey Merchants had not been used to From whence some of them more addicted to superstitious Observations than the rest blindly imagined that since the farther they went Northward the Days were the longer and in some parts hardly any Night the  Elisium Shades  must needs be thereabouts and that if they should go further they should come at length to Bright Eternal Day They were surpriz'd not with the Storms and Tempests only but with the Tides and Currents which were not only strange to 'em but particularly terrible in that they drove 'em in amongst the Rocks and Shores where they often perish'd not from any Real Danger but for Want of Judgment From whence we have them often expressing themselves in this manner  And BRITISH Seas  II here Storms incessant blow  And Tides uncertain ebbe and flow  Phenician  Sailors wise in Ignorance  That dream't of  Thule  an Island in the north of  Scotland  was frequently fabled among the Ancients to represent the  Elisium  which could be for no other Reason than the

Had they thy  Scally Shoals of Blessings  known  They'd long since chose  thy Shores  and quite sorgot  their own  Thine had been  India  and thy Golden Seas  Had fill'd their Antique Songs  But Fear

uncommon with the rest of Brittain  subservient grown  Calm Tides smooth Surface and a shining Brow  And gentle Gales for Wealth and Commerce blow  These reconcile the once so dreadful Waste  And  Art

The  Practicable Seas  made so by the Improvements of Navigation and particularly the Extraordinary Methods of Building as well as of Managing great Ships sitting them to bear the roughest Sea and to

kept those Seas for so many Ages impracticable doubtless prevented the Discovery of the great Treasure of the Fishery was not that their taking of them could have lessened the Quantity but without doubt Foreign Nations might have been prompted not to have fish'd here only and in time have been too strong to be displac'd but perhaps have taken Possession of the Land for the sake of the Vast Trade And so a more powerful Nation have dispossest the  Scots  both of their Trade and their Country too  the Cold  Had not the Storms and Tempests govern'd here  And fenc'd this  long hid Treasure

accepted Blessings  hear  From the profound unmeasur'd Deeps  Where Nature all her Wonders keeps  Her  Instinct  is here represented as delivering a Message in the Watry Audience and making a Speech to the Fish the Image its hoped is not improper nor is the Liberty taken at all unpoetical so I make no excuse for it but think that what we call  Instinct  may serve to represent Nature in all the Creatures obeying their Times and Seasons exactly according to the great and just Law of Creation and the Influence of Invisible Providence  Handmaid Instinct  this Blest Message gave  To all the

Bid'em Complain  Indeed 'tis strange to think they should let such a Wealth pass by them and at the same time complain of Poverty  no more of Poverty  Upbraid their sloth and then return to me  Visit no other Port it is plain they are not found in any considerable quantity in any Seas but these and 'tis supposed they return to the Northward again where the Prodigious Breed must increase sufficiently to supply for the next Years Voyage  Visit no other Port  Without question they supply very much any Defect of Provisions which either by the Sterillity of the Countrey or rather want of Improvement that People may labour under  The punctual well instructed Fish obey  And  Scaly Squadrons  spread the Northern Sea  Directly point their Course and find the Shore  As if they'd all been

Throng  Too bright for Verse too num'rous for our Song  Our Ancestors had merited in vain  If our new steps did not their old maintain  But as our Modern Virtue stands as high  The present Worthies do the past supply  A  certain Pledge our Name shall never dy  And now with Just regard let's view  the Fair  Beauty can make no Breach of Union here  Th' Equalities agree on either hand  The Ladies  no equivalent  demand  Nor will their Virtue be exhausted here  But still the Sex their just Proportions bear  Blest Mixture equally Devout and Gay  For Virtue only can both smile and pray  No Scale of calculated Right will ly  Betwixt the Quantity and Quality  England  indeed the larger Roll may claim  And  English  Beauty will preserve her Name  But these the Merit equally divide  Have all their Beauty only want their Pride  And now to Wonders turn your listning Ear  Visit the Commonwealth of Learning here  See how  Apollo  's Nurs'ry thrives and how  Wit blooms  in spight of Climat Storms

Inocculate the Seasons tend  And ev'ry fruitful Scyon to its Stock they bend  See here how ev'ry Plant in order thrives  And spight of Clime the tend'rest Blossom lives  Here  Epicks  thick as Groves

is supposed to be effectual to keep Toads and Venemous Creatures from the Sage  Zeal  Fitted her rash Infections to repell  Next this in constant Bloom's a Range of Wit  And ev'ry day  'tis weeded  of Conceit  Kept thin intrench'd and never runs to seed  But ripens gently in its flowry Bed  For Wit's a Plant so apt to grow in haste  It shakes the Root and then decays as fast  Strong Sciences  in

Talk'd of  by many  understood  by few  It's only Help is Honesty and where  That thrives it gets some Strength but's very rare  By Weeds of Self and Jealousie ore'run  'Tis choak'd for want of Air

Feet  Who  extract  Learning then refin't to wit  By the laborious  Lymbeck  of the Brain  Condense the Sp'rit and let the Humid parts remain  No loytring Singsong Muses trifle here  Weaving THIN
