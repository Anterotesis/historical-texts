 THE  CoffeeHouse  Politician OR  THE JUSTICE  Caught in his own  TRAP  A COMEDY As it is Acted at the TheatreRoyal in  Lincoln'sInn Fields  Written by Mr  FIELDING  LONDON  Printed for J WATTS at the PrintingOffice in  WildCourt  near  Lincoln'sInn Fields  MDCCXXX  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr  PAGET  IN ancient  Greece  the Infant  Muse  's School  Where  Vice  first felt the Pen of  Ridicule    With honest Freedom and impartial Blows  The  Muse  attack'd each  Vice  as it arose  No Grandeur could the  Mighty Villain  screen  From the just  Satyr  of the  Comick  Scene  No Titles could the  daring Poet  cool  Nor save the great  Right Honourable Fool  They spar'd not even the Aggressor's Name  And Publick  Villany  felt Publick  Shame  Long hath this gen'rous Method been disus'd  For  Vice  hath grown too great to be abus'd  By Pow'r defended from the Piercing Dart  It reigns and triumphs in the  Lordly Heart    While  Beaus  and  Cits  and  Squires  our Scenes afford  Justice  preserves the  Rogues  who weild the Sword  All  Satyr  against her Tribunal's quash'd  Nor lash the  Bards  for fear of being lash'd  But the Heroick  Muse  who sings Tonight  Through these neglected Tracks attempts her Flight  Vice  cloath'd with Pow'r she combats with her Pen  And fearless dares the  Lyon  in his Den  Then only Reverence to  Pow'r  is due  When  Publick Welfare  is its only View  But when the  Champions  whom the  Publick  arm  For their own Good with  Pow'r  attempt their  Harm    He sure must meet the  general Applause    Who 'gainst those  Traytors  fights the  Publick Cause  And while these Scenes the conscious  Knave  displease  Who feels within the  Criminal  he sees  The  Uncorrupt  and  Good  must smile to find  No Mark for  Satyr  in his  Generous Mind  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs  MULLART  RAPE upon Rape  what Author ever chose  A Name so sure to make the Fair his Foes  And Ladies I can read in all your Faces  Our Author is not much in your good Graces  But pray confess does all this Fury fall  Because these Scenes  Rape upon Rape  we call  Or is itthat we have no Rape at all  Our modern Beaus in Vigour are so hearty  And modern Dames so very full of Vartue  So scarce immodest Women Men so urging  A Rape's almost as common as aVirgin  Oh may our Youth whose Vigour is so parlous  To  Italy  be wafted with  Don Carlos    There should one Victory but give them Scope  They would not leave one Maidenhead for the Pope  Or should some new Pope  Joan  the Chair possess  They'd play the Devil with herHoliness  Rape upon Rape should follow Blows on Blows  And New  Rome  fall by what the Old arose  Lucretia  surely tho' her Fame has sounded  With Ardour for her Country ne'er abounded  Who so abhorr'd what had her Country founded  Heathenish Wretch the Pious Christian Wife  Tho' ravish'd still contents herself with Life  So zealous from SelfMurther we refrain  We live tho' sure of ravishing again  What need has She of Penance or Repenting  Who undergoes it all without consenting  She sure tho' with her Sword  Lucretian  swagger  Requires a Cordial rather than a Dagger  But may no fear of Ravishing affright  The beauteous kind Spectators of Tonight  Safe to your Husbands Arms may you escape  And never know that dreadful thing a  RAPE  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Worthy  Mr  Paget  Squeezum  Mr  Jones  Politick  Mr  Roscoe  Ramble  Mr  Mullart

in  Politick  's House A Table spread with NewsPapers Chairs  Hilaret Cloris  HILARET  _WELL  Cloris  this is a mad Frolick I am horridly frighted at the Thoughts of throwing my self into the Power of a young Fellow  Clo  It is natural to us to be frighted at first I was in a little Terror my self on my WeddingDay but it went all off before the next Morning a Husband like other Bugbears loses all his Horror when we once know him thoroughly  Hil  But if he should not prove a good Husband  Clo  Then you must not prove a good WifeIf he keeps a Mistress do you keep a Gallant if he  stay out with his Friends at a Tavern do you be merry with your Friends at home  Hil  You give fine Advice indeed  Clo  Upon my Word Madam it was such as I followed my self I had a Rogue of a Husband that robbed me of all I had and kept a Mistress under my Nose but I was even with him for it hath been ever my Opinion that a Husband like a Courtier who is above doing the Duties of his Office should keep a Deputy  Hil  But suppose you had been in Love with your Husband  Clo  Why so I was Madam as long as he deserved it but Love like Fire naturally goes out when it hath nothing to feed on  Hil  Well if it be possible to be assured of a Lover's Sincerity I think I may be assured of  Constant  at least it is adviseable to persuade my self of his Truth whom I should Love tho' he wanted itAh  Cloris  you may as easily remove a Rock as a Woman's Passion  Clo  And yet it is very often built on a sandy Foundation  Hil  Love is the same whatever be its Object We as often like Men for imaginary as real Perfections we all look through a Prismatick Glass in Love and whatever Beauties we have once fancied we never lose the Opinion ofour Amorous Faith is as implicit as our Religious  Clo  If I have any Judgment in Mankind and I am sure I have had some Experince in them your Passion could have been no where better fixed Capt  Constant  hath all the Qualities any Woman can desire He hath Youth Beauty Vigour Gallantry Constancy and as Mr  Cowley  says a long  c  SCENE II  Politick Hilaret Cloris  Pol  Ay there it goes tick tack tick tack like the Pendulum of a Clock What Mischief are you hatching  heyIt is impossible that two Women should be together without producing Mischief  Clo  I always thought a Man and Woman the more likely to produce Mischief and yet I think them the properer Company  Pol  I suppose you will tell my Daughter so too  Hil  Indeed Papa she need not for I was always of that Opinion  Pol  You was but I shall prevent your Wishes  Hil  You may be mistaken  Aside  Pol  I do not believe the Head of Cardinal  Fleury  can be more perplexed than mine is with this Girl To govern your self is greater than to govern a Kingdom said an old Philosopher and to govern a Woman is greater than to govern twenty Kingdoms  Hil  I wish you would not perplex your self with Cardinals or Kingdoms I wish you would mind your own Business instead of the Publick's dear Papa don't give your self any more trouble about  Don Carlos  unless you can get him for a SoninLaw  Pol  Not if I were a King I will make you a little sensible who  Don Carlos  is  Hil  Nay I do not understand one Word of your Politicks  Pol  I am sorry you do notA NewsPaper would be a more profitable Entertainment for you than a Romance You would find more in one half Sheet than in the grand  Cyrus  Hil  More Lies very probablyYou know I do read the Home Paragraphs in the  Whitehail  Evening Post and that's the best of them  Pol  If you would be informed in these Matters you must read all that come out about forty every Day and some Days fifty and of a  Saturday  about fourscore Would you continue in such a Course but one Twelvemonth I do not question but you might know as much of Politicks asany Man that comes to our Coffeehouse And I had rather see you a Politician than a Woman of Quality  Hil  If I may speak freely it would have been better for me that you had been less a Politician  Pol  You are deceived very much deceived but some Fool hath put this into your Head You may live to see me one of the greatest Men in  England  Did I not say at the Siege of  Gibraltar  that within one three Years we should see whether we should have Peace or no And yet I am an  Ignoramus  I know nothing I warrant you I had better have continued a Merchant no doubt but then what had become of my Projects where had been all those twenty different Schemes which I have now ready to lay before the Parliament greatly for my own Honour and the Interest of my Country Harkye I have contrived a Method to pay off the Debts of the Nation without a Penny of Money  Hil  And you will not get a Penny by it I dare swear  Pol  No no no certainly tho' I would not take twenty thousand Pounds for the Advantage which will arise to me from it It hath lain these three Years in a Friend's Hands of mine of the House of Commons who assured me not many Days ago that it should be taken shortly into Consideration tho' he believed it could not be this Sessions  Hil  Nor this Age I am confident  Aside  Pol  And how do you think it is to be compassed why by procuring a Machine to carry Ships by Land about a hundred Miles and so prosecute the  EastIndia  Trade thro' the  Mediterranean  Hil  I wish you Success Sir but I must take my leave of you for it grows very late so goodNight Papa  Exit  SCENE III  Politick  Solus  I cannot rest for these Preparations of the  Turks  what can be their DesignIt must be against the EmperorAy ay we shall have another Campaign in  Hungary  I wish we may feel no other  effect from themshould the  Turkish  Gallies once find a Passage through the  Straights  who can tell the Consequence I hope I shall not live to see that Day  SCENE IV  Politick Dabble  Dab  We are all undone Neighbour  Politick  all blown up all ruined  Pol  Protect uswhat is the Matter No News of the  Turks  I hope  Dab  An Express is arrived with an Account of the  Dauphin  's Death  Pol  Worse and worsethis is a finishing Stroke indeed Mr  Dabble  I take this Visit exceeding kindpray be pleased to sit we must confabulate on this Important AccidentPray light your PipeI wish this may not retard the Introduction of  Don Carlos  into  Italy  Dab  I wish it may  Pol  How  Dab  I wish  Don Carlos  do not prove a more formidable Power than is imagined  Pol  Don Carlos  a formidable Power Mr  Dabble  Dab  I wish we do not find him so  Pol  Sir I look on  Don Carlos  to be an errant Blank in the Affairs of  Europe  and let me observe to you the  Turks  give me much greater Uneasiness than  Don Carlos  can What the design of their Preparations can be is difficult to determinethis I know that I know nothing of the matter  Dab  I think we have no need to travel so far for Apprehensions when Danger is so near us the Prospect of Affairs in the  West  is so black that I see no Reason to regard the  East  the monstrous Power which  Don Carlos  may be possessed of by the Death of the  Dauphin    Pol  Rather the monstrous Power which the Emperor may be possessed of  Dab  The Emperorah  Pol  Don Carlos  truly  Both shake their Heads at one another  Dab  I would fain ask one Question Mr  Politick  Prav how large do you take  Tuscany  to be  Pol  How large do I take  Tuscany  to belet me see  Tuscany  ay how large do I take it to behum  Faithful  bring some more Tobacco How large do I take it to bewhy truly I take it to be about as large as the Kingdom of  France  or something larger  Dab  As large as the Kingdom of  France  you might as well compare this TobaccoPipe to a Canon Why  Tuscany  Sir is only a Town a Garrison to be admitted into  Tuscany  that is into the Town of  Tuscany    Pol  Sir I will convince you of your Errorhere  Faithful  bring a Map of  Europe  hither  Dab  I did not think Mr  Politick  you had been so ignorant in Geography  Pol  Sir I believe I know as much as you or any one of it  SCENE V  Politick Dabble Faithful  Faith  Sir Sir your Daughter is gone out of the House no one knows whither  Pol  And give me leave to tell you Sir I wish your own Ignorance in publick Affairs doth not appear to our Cost  Dab  Sir I wish you would send for the Map  Pol  Map me no Maps Sir my Head is a Map a Map of the whole World  Faith  Sir your Daughter  Dab  If your Head be a Map it is a very erroneous one  Pol  Sir I would not have called  Tuscany  a Town in a CoffeeHouse to have been Master of it  Dab  Nor I have compared it to  France  to have been King of both  SCENE VI  Politick Dabble Faithful Porer  Por  Great News Gentlemen all's safe again  Pol  More Deaths  Por  An Express is arrived with a certain Account of the  Dauphin  's being in good Health  Dab  This is good News indeed  Pol  Is there a certain Confirmation  Por  Very certainI came this moment from the Secretary's Office  Pol  Dear Mr  Porer  you are the welcomest Man aliveThis News makes me the happiest Creature living  Faith  I wish Sir my News may not prevent itYour Daughter Sir Miss  Hilaret  is gone out of the House and no one knows whither▪  Pol  My Daughter gone that is some allay to my Happiness I confess but the loss of twenty Daughters would not balance the Recovery of the  Dauphin  However Gentlemen you will excuse me I must go enquire into this Affair  Dab  Be not concerned at any thing after what you have heard let the Priva  e give way to the Publick ever  Exeunt  SCENE VII  The Street  Sotmore Ramble  Sotm  Why thou wilt not leave us yet and sneak away to some nasty little Whore A Pox confound them they have spoiled so many of my Companions and forced me to Bed sober at threeaClock in the Morning so oftenthat if the whole Sex were going to the Devil I would drink a Bumper to their good Journey  Ram  And I would go thither along with them The dear charming Creatures Woman It is the best Word that ever was invented There's Musick there's Magick in it  Mark Anthony  knew well to lay out his Money and when he gave the World for a Womanhe bought a lumping Pennyworth  Sot  If he had given it for a Hogshead of good Claret I would have commended the Purchase more  Ramb  Wine is only the Prologue to Love it only serves to raise our Expectation The Bottle is but a Passport to the Bed of Pleasure Brutes drink to quench their Appetitesbut Lovers to enflame them  Sot  'Tis Pity the generous Liquor should be used to no better a Purpose  Ramb  It is the noblest use of the Grape and the greatest Glory of  Bacchus  is to be Page to  Venus  Sot  Before I go into a Tavern again with a Man who will sneak away after the first Bottle may I be cursed with the odious sight of a Pint as long as I live or become Member of a CityClub where Men drink out of Thimbles that the Fancy may be heightened by the Wine about the same time that the Understanding is improved by the Conversation I'll sooner drink Coffee with a Politician Tea with a fine Lady or 'Rack Punch with a fine Gentleman than thus be made a Whetstone of to sharpen my Friends Inclinations that some little Strumpet may enjoy the Benefit of that good Humour which I have raised  Ramb  Why thou art as illnatured and as angry as a Woman would be who was disappointed in the last Moment when her Expectations were at the highest  Sot  And have I not the same Cause  Ramb  Truly honest  Nol  when a Man's Reason begins to stagger I think him the properest Company for the Women One Bottle more and I had been fit for no Company at all  Sot  Then thou hadst been carried off with GloryAn honest Fellow should no more quit the Tavern while he can stand than a Soldier should the Field but you fine Gentlemen are for preserving your selves safe from both for the Benefit of the Ladies'Sdeath I'll use you with the same Scorn that a Soldier would a Coward So Sir when I meet you next be not surprized if I walk on the other side the way  Ramb  Nay pr'ythee dear  Silenus  be not so enraged I'll but take one refreshing turn and come  back to the Tavern to thee  Burgundy  shall be the Word and I will fight under thy Command till I drop  Sot  Now thou art an honest Fellowand thou shalt Toast whomsoever thou pleasestWe'll bumper up her Health till thou dost enjoy her in Imagination To a warm Imagination there is no Bawd like a Bottle It shall throw into your Arms the soberest Prude or wildest Coquet in Town thou shalt rifle her Charms in spight of her Art Nay thou shalt encrease her Charms more than her Art and when thou art surfeited with the luscious Pleasure wake cooly the next Morning without any Wife by your side or any fear of Children  Ramb  What a luscious Picture hast thou drawn  Sot  And thou shalt have it Boy thou shalt triumph over her Virtue if she be a Woman of Qualityor raise her Blushes if she be a common Strumpet I'll go order a new Recruit upon the Table and expect you with Impatience  Fill every Glass  Sings  Exit  Sotmore  SCENE VIII  Ramble  solus  Ramb  Sure this Fellow's whole Sensation lies in his Throat for he is never pleased but when he is swallowing And yet the Hogshead will be as soon drunk with the Liquor it contains as he I wish it had no other Effect upon me Pox of my Paper Scull I have no sooner buried the Wine in my Belly than its Spirit rises in my HeadI am in a very proper Humour for a Frolick If my good Genius and her evil one would but send some lovely Female in my wayHa the Devil hath heard my Prayers  SCENE IX  Ramble Hilaret  Hil  Was ever any thing so unfortunate to lose this Wench in the Scuffle and not know a step of the WayWhat shall I do  Ramb  By all my love of Glory an Adventure  Hil  Ha who's that who are you Sir  Ramb  A Cavalier Madam a Knight Er  ant rambling about the World in quest of Adventures To plunder Widows and ravish Virgins to lessen the Number of Bullies and encrease that of Cuckolds are the Obligations of my Profession  Hil  I wish you all the Success so worthy an Adventurer deserves  Going  Ramb  But hold Madam I am but just sallied and you are the first Adventure I have met with  Takes hold of her  Hil  Let me go I beseech you Sir I will have nothing to say to any of your Profession  Ramb  That's unkind Madam for as I take it our Professions are pretty nearly allied and like Priest and Nun we are proper Company for one another  Hil  My Profession Sir  Ramb  Yes Madam I believe I am no Stranger to the honourable Rules of your Order Nay 'tis probable I may know your Abbess too for tho' I have not been in Town a Week I am acquainted with half a Dozen  Hil  Nothing but your Drink Sir and Ignorance of my Quality could excuse this Rudeness  Ramb  Whu  whistles  Ignorance of your Quality The Daughter of some Person of Rank I warrant her  Aside  Look'e my Dear I shall not trouble my self with your Quality It is equal to me whether your Father rode in a Coach and Six or drove itI have had as much Joy in the Arms of an honest Boatswain's Wife as with a Relation of the  Great Mogul  Hil  You look Sir so much like a Gentleman that I am persuaded this Usage proceeds only from your mistaking me I own it looks a little odd for a Woman of Virtue to be found alone in the Street at this Hour  Ramb  Yes it does look a little odd indeed  Aside  Hil  But when you know my Story I am confident you will assist me rather than otherwise I have this very Night escaped with my Maid from my Father's House and as I was going to put my self into the Hands of my Lover a Scuffle happening in the Street and both running away in a Fright to avoid it we unluckily separated from each otherNow Sir I relie on the Generosity of your Temper to assist an unhappy Woman for which you shall not only have my Thanks but those of a very pretty Fellow into the Bargain  Ramb  I am that very pretty Fellow's very humble Servant But I find I am too much in Love with you my self to preserve you for another Had you proved what I at first took you for I should have parted with you easily but I read a Coronet in your Eyes she shall be her Grace if she pleases I had rather give her a Title than Money  Aside  Hil  Nay now you mistake me as widely as you did at first  Ramb  Nay by this Frolick Madam you must be either a Woman of Quality or a Woman of the TownYour low mean People who govern themselves by Rules dare not attempt these noble Flights of Pleasure Flights only to be reached by those who boldly soar above Reputation  Hil  This is the maddest Fellow  Aside  Ramb  So my Dear whether you be of Quality or no Quality you and I will go drink one Bottle together at the next Tavern  Hil  I have but one Way to get rid of him  Aside  Ramb  Come my dear Angel Oh this dear soft Hand  Hil  Could I but be assur'd that my Virtue would be safe  Ramb  No where safer I'll give thee any thing in Pawn for itbut my Watch  Aside  Hil  And then my Reputation  Ramb  The Night will take Care of thatVirtue and Reputation these Whores have learnt a strange Cant since I left  England  Aside  Hil  But will you love me always  Ramb  Oh for ever and ever to be sure  Hil  But will youtoo  Ramb  Yes I willtoo  Hil  Will you promise to be civil  Ramb  Oh yes yes I was afraid she would have asked me for Money  Aside  Hil  Well then I will ventureGo you to that corner Tavern I'll follow you  Ramb  Excuse me Madam I know my Duty betterso if you please I'll follow you  Hil  I insist on your going first  Ramb  And so you'll leave me in the Lurch I see you are frighted at the Roughness of my Dress but foregad I am an honest Tar and the Devil take me if I bilk you  Hil  I don't understand you  Ramb  Why then Madam here is a Pound of as good Tea as ever came out of the  Indies  you understand that I hope  Hil  I shall take no Bribes Sir  Ramb  Refuse the Tea I like you now indeed for you cannot have been long upon the Town I'm sure But I grow weary with Impatience If you are a modest Woman and insist on the Ceremony of being carried with all my Heart  Hil  Nay Sir do not proceed to Rudeness  Ramb  In short my Passion will be dallied with no longer Do you consider I am just come on Shore that I have seen nothing but Men and the Clouds this half Year and a Woman is as ravishing a Sight to me as the returning Sun to  Greenland  I am none of your puisny Beaux that can look on a fine Woman like a surfeited Man on an Entertainment My Stomach's sharp and you are an Ortelan and if I do not eat you up may salt Beef be my Fare for ever  Takes her in his Arms  Hil  I'll alarm the Watch  Ramb  You'll be better natur'd than that At least to encounter Danger is my Profession so have at you  my little  Venus  If you don't consent Ill ravish you  Hil  Help there a Rape a Rape  Ramb  Hush hush you call too loud People will think you are in earnest  Hil  Help a Rape  SCENE X  Ramble Hilaret Staff Watch  Staff  That's he there seize him  Ramb  Stand off ye Scoundrels  Staff  Ay Sir you should have stood offDo you charge this Man with a Rape Madam  Hil  I am frighted out of my Senses  Staff  A plain Casethe Rape is sufficiently provedwhat was the Devil in you to ravish a Woman in the Street thus  Hil  Oh dear Mr Constable all I desire is that you would see me safe home  Staff  Never fear Madam you shall not want Evidence  Aside to her  Ramb  Nay if I must lodge with these Gentlemen I am resolved to have your Company Madam Mr Constable I charge that Lady with threatning to swear a Rape against me and laying violent Hands upon my Person whilst I was inoffensively walking along the Street  Hil  How Villain  Ramb  Ay ay Madam you shall be made a severe Example of The Laws are come to a fine Pass truly when a Sober Gentleman can't walk the Streets for Women  Hil  For Heaven's sake Sir don't believe him  Staff  Nay Madam as we have but your bare Affirmation on both Sides we cannot tell which Way to incline our Belief that will be determin'd in the Morning by your CharactersI would not have you dejected you shall not want a Character  Aside to her  Hil  This was the most unfortunate Accident sure that ever befel a Woman of Virtue  Staff  If you are a Woman of Virtue the Gentleman will be hanged for attempting to rob you of it If you are not a Woman of Virtue why you will be whipped for accusing a Gentleman of robbing you of what you had not to lose  Hil  Oh this unfortunate FrightBut Mr Constastable I am very willing that the Gentleman should have his Liberty give me but mine  Staff  That Request Madam is a very colloborating Circumstance against you  Ramb  Guilt will ever discover it self  Staff  Bring them along▪  Watch  She looks like a modest Woman in my Opinion  Ramb  Confound all your modest Women I saya Man can have nothing to do with a modest Woman but he must be married or hanged for't  Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I  SCENE Justice  Squeezum  's a Table Pen Ink Paper  c  Squeezum Quill  Squeez  DID Mother  Bilkum  refuse to pay my Demands say you  Quill  Yes Sir she says she does not value your Worship's Protection of a Farthing for that she can bribe two Juries a Year to acquit her in  Hicks  's  Hall  for half the Money which she hath paid you within these three Months  Squeez  Very fine I shall shew her that I understand something of Juries as well as her self  Quill  make a  Memorandum  against Mother  Bilkum  's Trial that we  may remember to have the Pannel No they are a Set of good Men and true and hearken to no Evidence but mine  Quill  Sir Mr  Snap  the Bailiff's Follower hath set up a Shop and is a Freeholder He hopes your Worship will put him into a Pannel on the first Vacancy  Squeez  Minute him down for No I think half of that Pannel are Bailiffs Followers Thank Heaven the Laws have not excluded those Butchers  Quill  No Sir the Law forbids Butchers to be Jurymen but does not forbid Jurymen to be Butchers  Squeez  Quill  d'ee hear look out for some new Recruits for the Pannel No We shall have a swinging Vacancy there the next SessionsTruly if we do not take some care to regulate the Juries in the  OldBaily  we shall have no Juries for  Hicks  's  Hall  Quill  Very true Sir But that Pannel hath been more particularly unfortunate I believe I remember it hanged at least twice over  Squeez  Ay poor Fellows We must all take our Chance  Quill  The Man who would live in this World must not fear the next The Chance of Peace is d  ubtful as that of War and they who will make their Fortunes at Home should entertain no more Dread of the Bench than a Soldier should of the Field We are all militant here and a Halter hath been fatal to many a great Man as well as a Bullet  SCENE II  Squeezum Quill Staff  Quill  Sir here's Mr  Staff  the Reforming Constable  Staff  An't please your Worship we have been at the GamingHouse in the Alley and have taken Six Prisoners whereof we discharged two who had your Worship's License  Squeez  What are the others  Staff  One is an Halfpay Officer another an Attorney's  Clerk and the other two are young Gentlemen of the  Temple  Squeez  Discharge the Officer and the Clerk there is nothing to be got by the Army or the Law the one hath no Money and the other will part with none But be not too forward to quit the  Templers  Staff  Asking your Worship's Pardon I don't care to run my Finger into the Lion's Mouth I would not willingly have to do with any Limb of the Law  Squeez  Fear not these bear no nearer Affinity to Lawyers than a Militia Regiment of Squires do to Soldiers the one gets no more by his Gown than the other by his Sword These are Men that bring Estates to the  Temple  instead of getting them there  Staff  Nay they are bedawb'd with Lace as fine as Lords  Squeez  Never fear a Lawyer in Lacethe Lawyer that sets out in Lace always ends in Rags  Staff  I'll secure themWe went to the House where your Worship commanded us and heard the Dice into the Street but there were two Coaches with Coronets on them at the Door so we thought it proper not to go in  Squeez  You did right The Laws are Turnpikes only made to stop People who walk on Foot and not to interrupt those who drive through them in their CoachesThe Laws are like a Game at Loo where a Blaze of Court Cards is always secure and the Knaves are the safest Cards in the Pack  Staff  We have taken up a Man for a Rape too  Squeez  What is he  Staff  I fancy he's some great Man for he talks  French  sings  Italian  and swears  English  Squeez  Is he rich  Staff  I believe not for we can't get a Farthing out of him  Squeez  A certain Sign that he is Deep Pockets are like deep Streams and Money like Water never runs faster than in the Shallows  Staff  Then there's another Misfortune too  Squeez  What's that  Staff  The Woman will not swear any thing against him  Squeez  Never fear that I'll make her swear enough for my Purpose What sort of a Woman is she  Staff  A common Whore I believe  Squeez  The properest Person in the World to swear a Rape A modest Woman is as shy of swearing a Rape as a Gentleman is of swearing a BatteryWe will make her swear enough to frighten him into a Composition a small Part of which will satisfie the Woman So go bring them before meBut hold have you been at home since I sent a Prisoner thither this Morning  Staff  Yes an't please your Worship  Squeez  And what says he  Staff  He threatens us confoundedly and says you have committed him without any Accusation I'm afraid we shall get nothing out of him  Squeez  We'll try him till Noon however  SCENE III  Squeezum  Mrs  Squeezum  Mrs Squeez  I desire Mr  Squeezum  you would finish all your dirty Work this Morning for I am resolved to have the House to my self in the Afternoon  Squeez  You shall my Dear and I shall be obliged to you if you can let me have the Coach this Morning  Mrs Squeez  I shall use it my self  Squeez  Then I must get Horses put into the Chariot  Mrs Squeez  I am not determined whether I shall use the Coach or Chariot so it is impossible you should have either Besides a Hack is the properest to do Business in and as I cannot spare you a Servant will look better  Squeez  Well Child well it shall be soLet  me only beg the Favour of Dining a little sooner than ordinary  Mrs Squeez  That is so far from being possible that we cannot Dine 'till an Hour later than usual because I must attend at an Auction or I shall lose a little  China  Basin which is worth its Weight in Jewels and it is probable I may get it for its Weight in Gold which will not be above One Hundred Guineas and those you must give me Child  Squeez  A Hundred Guineas for a  China  Bason Oh the Devil take the  EastIndia  Trade The Clay of the one  Indies  runs away with all the Gold of the other  Mrs Squeez  I may buy it for less but it is good to have rather too much Money about one than too little  Squeez  In short I cannot support your Extravagance  Mrs Squeez  I do not desire you to support my Extravagance  Squeez  I wish you would not  Mrs Squeez  Thus stands the Case You say I am extravagant I say I am not sure my Word will ballance yours every where but at  Hicks  's  Hall  And heark'e my Dear if whenever I ask for a Trifle you object my Extravagance to me I'll be reveng'd I'll blow you up I'll discover all your midnight Intrigues your protecting Ill Houses your bribing Juries your snacking Fees your whole Train of Rogueries If you do not allow me what I ask I'll bid fair to enter on my Jointure Sir  Squeez  Well my Dear this Time you shall be indulgedTrust a Thief or Lawyer with your Purse▪ a Whore or Physician with your Constitution bu  never trust a dangerous Secret with your Wife fo  when once you have put it into her Power to hang you the sooner you are hang'd the better  Aside▪  SCENE IV  Squeezum Quill  Mrs  Squeezum Staff Watch Ramble Hilaret  Staff  An't please your Worship here is a Gentleman hath committed a Rape last Night on this young Woman  Squeez  How a Rape Hath he committed a Rape on you Child  Mrs Squeez  This may be worth hearing  Aside  Hil  Sir I have nothing to say against him I desire you would give us both our Liberty He was a little frolicksome last Night which made me call for these People's Help and when once they had taken hold of us they would not suffer us to go away  Squeez  They did their DutyThe Power of Discharging lieth in us and not in them  Ramb  Sir  Squeez  Sir I beg we may not be interrupted Heark'e young Woman if this Gentleman hath treated you in an ill manner do not let your Modesty prevent the Execution of Justice Consider you will be guilty your self of the next Offence he commits and upon my Word by his Looks it is probable he may commit a Dozen Rapes within this Week  Hil  Sir I assure you he is innocent  Squeez  Mr  Staff  what say you to this Affair  Staff  May it please your Worship I saw the Prisoner behave in a very indecent manner and heard the Woman say he had ravished away her Senses  Squeez  Fye upon you Child will you not swear this  Hil  No Sir but I shall swear something against you unless you discharge us  Squeez  That cannot be Madam the Fact is too plain If you will not swear now the Prisoner must be kept in Custody 'till you will  Staff  If she will not swear we can swear enough to convict him  Ramb  Very fine faith this Justice is worse than a Grand Inquisitor Pray honest formidable Sir what private Pique have you against me that you would compel the Lady to deserve the Pillory in order to promote me higher  Squeez  My Dear did you ever see such a ravishing Look as this Fellow hath Sir if I was a Judge I would hang you without any Evidence at all They are such Fellows as these who sow Dissention between Man and Wife and keep up the Names of Cuckold and Bastard in the Kingdom  Ramb  Nay if that be all you accuse me of I will confess it freely I have employ'd my Time pretty well Tho' as I do not remember ever to have done you the Honour of Dubbing Mr  Justice  I cannot see why you should be so incensed against me for I do not imagine you any otherwise an Enemy to these Amusements than a Popish Priest to Sin or a Doctor to Disease  Mrs Squeez  You are very civil Sir to threaten to dub my Husband before my Face  Ramb  I ask Pardon Madam I did not know with whom I had the Honour to be in Company it was always against my Inclination to affront a Lady but a Woman of your particular Merit must have claimed the most particular Respect  Mrs Squeez  I should have expected no Rudeness from a Gentleman of your Appearance and would much rather attribute any misbecoming Word to Inadvertency than Design  Ramb  Madam I know not how to thank so much Goodness but do assure you I would buy an Introduction to your Acquaintance at a much greater Danger than this Prosecution which I believe you already see the Malice of I hope Madam I stand already acquitted in your Opinion  Mrs Squeez  I hope Sir it will only appear to have been a Frolick I must own I have been always a great Enemy to Forcesince there are so many willing  Ramb  So I find there is no danger of a Rape here  Aside  Mrs Squeez  Well Child can you find any thing against this Gentleman  Squeez  The Woman is difficult of confessing in publick but I fancy when I examine her in private I may get it out of herSo Mr  Constable  withdraw your Prisoner  Mrs Squeez  Nay he appears so much of a Gentleman that till there be stronger Evidence I will take Charge of himCome Sir you shall go drink a dish of Tea with meYou may stay without  To the Constable  c  Ramb  This Kindness of yours Madam will be an Encouragement to Offenders  SCENE V  Squeezum Hilaret  Squeez  Come come Child you had better take the Oath tho' you are not altogether so sure Justice should be rigorous It is better for the Publick that ten Innocent People should suffer than that one Guilty should escape and it becomes every good Person to sacrifice their Conscience to the Benefit of the Publick  Hil  Would you persuade me to perjure my self  Squeez  By no means Not for the World Perjury indeed do you think I do not know what Perjury is better than you He did attempt to Ravish you you own very well He that attempts to do you an Injury hath done it in his Heart Besides a Woman may be Ravished ay and many a Woman hath been Ravished ay and Men been hanged for itwhen she hath not certainly known she hath been Ravished  Hil  You are a great Casuist in Conscience But you may spare your self any further Trouble for I assure you it will be in vain  Squeez  I see where your Hesitation hangs you are afraid of spoiling your TradeYou think Severity to a Customer will keep People from your House  Pray answer me one QuestionHow long have you been upon the Town  Hil  What do you mean  Squeez  Come come I see you are but a Novice and I like you the better For yours is the only Business wherein People do not profit by ExperienceYou are very handsomeIt is Pity you should continue in this abandoned StateGive me a KissNay be not coy to meI protest you are as full of Beauty as the Rose is of Sweetness and I of Love as its Stalk is full BriarsOh that we were as closely joined together too  Hil  Why you will commit a Rape your self Mr  Justice  Squeez  If I thought you would prove constant I would take you into keeping for I have not liked a Woman so much these many Years  Hil  I will humour this old Villain I am resolved  Aside  Squeez  What think you could you be constant to a vigorous healthy middleaged Man heycould this buy thy Affections off from a set of idle Rascals who carry their Gold upon their Backs and have Pockets as empty as their Heads Fellows who are greater Curses on a Woman than the Vapours for as those persuade her into imaginary Diseases these present her with realLet thy Silence give Consent here take this Purse as an Earnest of what I'll do for you  Hil  Well and what shall I do for this  Squeez  You shall doYou shall do nothing I will do I will be a Verb Active and you shall be a Verb Passive  Hil  I wish you be not of the Neuter Gender  Squeez  Why you little arch Rogue do you understand  Latin  Hussy  Hil  A little Sir my Father was a Country Parson and gave all his Children a good Education He taught his Daughters to write and read himself  Squeez  What have you Sisters then  Hil  Alackaday Sir sixteen of us and all in the same way of Business  Squeez  Ay this it is to teach Daughters to write I would as soon put a Sword into the Hand of a Madman as a Pen into those of a Woman for a Pen in the Hand of a Woman is as sure an Instrument of Propagation as a Sword in that of a Madman is of Destruction  Aside  Sure my Dear the Spirit of Love must run very strongly in the Blood of your whole Family  Hil  Oh Sir it was a villanous Man of War that harboured near usMy poor Sisters were ruined by the Officers and I fell a Martyr to the Chaplain  Squeez  Ay ay the Sailors are as fatal to our Women as the Soldiers are One  Venus  rose from the Sea and thousands have set in itBut not  Venus  her self could compare to thee my little Honeysuckle  Hil  Be not so hot Sir  Squeez  Bid the Touchwood be cold behind the Burningglass The Touchwood is not more easily kindled by the Sun than I by your dear Eyes  Hil  The Touch wood is not drier I dare swear  Aside  Squeez  But hark I hear my Wife returningleave word with my Clerk where I shall send to youI will be the kindest of Keepers very constant and very liberal  Hil  Two charming Qualities in a Lover  Squeez  My pretty Nosegay you will find me vastly preferable to idle young Rakehells Besides you are safe with me You are as safe with a Justice in  England  as a Priest abroad Gravity is the best Cloak for Sin in all CountriesBe sure to be punctual to the Time I shall appoint you  Hil  Be not afraid of me  Squeez  Adieu my pretty Charmer I shall burn with Impatience  SCENE VI  Squeezum  solus  Go thy ways for a charming Girl Now if I can get her at this wild Fellow's Expence I shall have performed the part of a shrewd Justice for I would make others  pay for my Sins as well as their own I fancy my Wife hath sufficiently frightned him by this and that he will truckle to any Terms to be acquitted for I must own she will pump a Man much better than IOh here they come I must deal with my Gentleman now in another Style  SCENE VII  Squeezum  Mrs  Squeezum Ramble  Ramb  Well Sir is the Lady determined to swear stoutly  Squeez  Truly it is hard to say what she determines she is gone to ask the Advice of a Divine and a Lawyer  Ramb  Then the odds is against me for the Lawyer will certainly advise her to swear and it is possible the Priest may not contradict her in it  Squeez  It is indeed a ticklish Point and it were advisable to make it up as soon as possible The first Loss is always the least It is better to wet your Coat than your Skin and to run home when the Clouds begin to drop than in the middle of the Storm In short it were better to give a brace of hundred Pounds to to make up the Matter now than to venture the Consequence I am heartily concerned to see a Gentleman in such a Misfortune I am sorry the Age is so corrupt Really I expect to see some grievous and heavy Judgment fall on the Nation We are as bad as ever  Sodom  and  Gomorrah  were and I wish we may not be as miserable  Ramb  Heark'e Justice I take a Sermon to be the first Punishment which a Man undergoes after conviction It is very hard I must be condemned to it beforehand  Mrs Squeez  Nay Sir I am sure Mr  Squeezum  speaks for your goodI shall get a Necklace out of this Affair  Aside  Squeez  Ay that I am sure I do my Interest sways not one way or the otherI would were I in that Gentleman's Circumstances do what I advise him to  Ramb  Faith Sir that I must doubt for were you in my Circumstances you would not be worth the Money  Squeez  Nay Sir now you jest with me a Gentleman can never be at a loss for such a Trifle  Ramb  Faith you mistake I know a great many Gentlemen not worth three Farthings he that resolves to be honest cannot resolve not to be poor  Squeez  A Gentleman and poor Sir they are Contradictions A Man may as well be a Scholar without Learning as a Gentleman without Riches But I have no time to dally with you If you do not understand good Usage while it is dealt you you may when you feel the Reverse The Affair may now be made up for a Trifle the time may come when your whole Fortune would be too littleAn Hour's Delay in the making up an Offence is as dangerous as in the sewing up of a Wound  Ramb  Well you have overpersuaded me I'll take your Advice  Squeez  I'll engage you will not repent itI don't question but you will regard me as your Friend  Ramb  That I do indeed And to give you the most substantial Instance of it I will ask a Favour which is expected only from the most intimate Friendshipwhich is that you would be so kind to lend me the Money  Squeez  Alackaday Sir I have not such a Sum in my Command Besides how must it look in me who am an Officer of Justice to lend a Culprit Money wherewith to evade Justice Alas Sir we must consider our Characters in Life we must act up to our Characters and tho' I deviate a little from mine in giving you Advice it would be entirely forsaking the Character of a Justice to give you Money  Mrs Squeez  I wonder how you could ask it  Ramb  Necessity obliges to any thing Madam Mr  Squeezum  was so kind to shew me the Necessity of giving Money and my Pockets were so cruel to shew me the Impossibility of it  Squeez  Well Sir if you cannot pay for your Transgressions like the Rich you must suffer for them like the PoorHere Constable  SCENE VIII  Squeezum  Mrs  Squeezum Ramble Staff Constables  Squeez  Take away your Prisoner keep him in safe Custody till farther Orders If you come to a wiser Resolution within these two Hours send me Word after that it will be too late  Ramb  Heark'e Mr Justice you had better use me as you ought and acquit me for if you do any thing which you cannot defend hang me if I am not revenged on you  Squeez  Hang youI wish there may not be more Meaning in those Words than you imagine  Ramb  'Sdeath you old Rascal I can scarce forbear rattling those old dry Bones of thine till they crack thy withered Skin  Squeez  Bear Evidence of this I am threatned in the Execution of my Office  Ramb  Come honest Mr Constable Mr nocturnal Justice let me go any where from this Fellowthe Night hath chosen a better Justice than the Day  SCENE IX  Squeezum  Mrs  Squeezum  Squeez  I am afraid I shall make nothing of this Fellow at last I have a Mind to discharge him  Mrs Squeez  Oh by no means for I am sure he hath Money  Squeez  Yes and so am I But suppose he will not part with it it is impossible to take it from him for there is no Law yet in being to skreen a Justice of Peace from a downright Robbery  Mrs Squeez  Try him a little longer however  Squeez  I will 'till the Afternoon but if he should not consent by that Time I must discharge him for  I have no Hopes in the Woman's Swearing She is discharged already  Mrs Squeez  I'll make him a Visit at the Constable's House and try if I can alarm him into a Composition I may make him do more than you imagine  Squeez  Do so my DearI doubt not your PowerGoodmorrow Honey  Mrs Squeez  But my Dear pray remember the Hundred Guineas  Squeez  Yes yes I shall remember them they are not likely to be soon forgottenFollow me to my Escritore  SCENE X  Mrs  Squeezum  sola  Since you are sure of going to the Devil honest Spouse I'll take Care to equip you with a Pair of Horns that you may be as like one another as possible This dear wild Fellow must be mine and shall be mine I like him so well that if he had even ravished me on my Conscience I should have forgiven him  SCENE XI  Mr  Worthy  's  Worthy Politick  Wor  Upon my Word Mr  Politick  I am heartily sorry for this Occasion of renewing our Acquaintance I can imagine the Tenderness of a Parent tho' I never was one  Pol  Indeed Neighbour  Worthy  you cannot imagine half the Troubles without having undergone them Matrimony balks our Expectations every way and our Children as seldom prove Comforts to us as our Wives I had but twowhereof one was hanged long agoand the other I suppose may be in a fair Way by this  Wor  In what manner did she escape from you  Pol  She had taken Leave of me to retire to Rest not half an Hour before I heard of her Departure I impute it all to the wicked Instructions of an Imp of the Devil called a Chambermaid who is the Companion of her Flight  Wor  But do you know of no Lover  Pol  Let me seeheyThere hath been a Fellow in a Red Coat with whom she hath conversed for some time in spite of my Teeth  Wor  Depend on it He is the Occasion of your Loss I can grant you a Warrant against him if you know his Name tho' I fear you are too late  Pol  No Sir I am not too late my Daughter is an Heiress and you know the Punishment for stealing an Heiress If I could hang the Rascal it would be some Satisfaction  Wor  That will be impossible without her Consent and truly if she be married I would advise you to follow the Example of that Emperor who when he discovered something worse than a Marriage between one of his Subjects and his Daughter chose rather to let him enjoy her as his own than punish him  Pol  Pray where did that Emperor reign  Wor  I have almost forgotten but I think it was one of the  Greek  Emperors or one of the  Turks  Pol  Bring me no Example from the  Turks  good Mr  Worthy  I find no such Affinity in our Interests Sir I dread and abhor the  Turks  I wish we do not feel them before we are aware  Wor  But Sir  Pol  But me no butswhat can be the Reason of all this warlike Preparation which all our Newspapers have informed us of Yes and the same Newspapers a hundred times in the same Words Is the Design against  Persia  Is the Design against  Germany  Is the Design against  Italy  Suppose we should see  Turkish  Gallies in the Channel We may feel them yes we may feel them in the midst of our Security  Troy  was taken in its Sleep and so may we  Wor  Sure Sir you are asleep or in a Dream  Pol  Yes yes these things are called idle Dreamsthe justest Apprehensions may be styled Dreamsbut let me tell you Sir Men betray their own Ignorance often in attacking that of other Men  Wor  But what is all this to your Daughter  Pol  Never tell me of my Daughter my Country is dearer to me than a thousand Daughters should the  Turks  come among us what would become of our Daughters then and our Sons and our Wives and our Estates and our Houses and our Religion and our LibertyWhen a  Turkish  Aga should command our Nobility and Janizaries make Grandfathers of Lords Where should we look for  Britain  then  Wor  Truly where I may look for Mr  Politick  now in the Clouds  Pol  Give me leave Sir only to let you a little into the present State of  Turkey  Wor  I must beg to be excused Sir if I can be of any Service to you in relation to your Daughter you may command my Attention I may probably defend you from your own Countrymen but truly from the  Turks  I cannot  Pol  I am glad to hear you have some Apprehension of them as well as my selfThat you are not so stupidly besotted as I meet with some People at the Coffeehouse but perhaps you are not enough apprized of the Danger Give me leave only to shew you how it is possible for the  Grand Signior  to find an Ingress into  Europe  Suppose Sir this Spot I stand on to be  Turkey  then here is  Hungary  Very wellhere is  France  and here is  England  grantedthen we will suppose he had Possession of  Hungary  what then remains but to conquer  France  before we find him at our own CoastBut Sir this is not all the Danger now I will shew you how he can come by Sea to us  Wor  Dear Sir refer that to some other time you have sufficiently satisfied me I assure you  Pol  It is almost time to go to the Coffeehouseso dear Mr  Worthy  I am your most obedient Servant  Wor  Mr  Politick  your very humble Servant  SCENE XII  Worthy  solus  I recollect the Dawnings of this political Humour to have appeared when we were at the  Bath  together but it hath risen finely in these ten Years What an Enthusiasm must it have arrived to when it could make him forget the Loss of his only Daughter The greatest Part of Mankind labour under one Delirium or other And  Don Quixotte  differed from the rest not in Madness but the Species of it The Covetous the Prodigal the Superstitious the Libertine and the Coffeehouse Politician are all  Quixottes  in their several Ways  That Man alone from Madness free we find  Who by no wild unruly Passion blind  To Reason gives the Conduct of his Mind  ACT III  SCENE I  SCENE The Street  Hilaret Cloris  meeting

 How  Clo  It is too true his own Servant told me  Hil  His Servant belied him and so do youshew me where he is if he be in a Dungeon I'll find him out  Clo  Very generous indeed Madam A King should sooner visit a Prisoner for Treason than I a Lover for a Rape  Hil  It would be unpardonable in me to entertain so flagrant a Belief at the first hearing against a Man who hath given me such substantial Proofs of his Constancy Besides an Affair of my own makes me the more doubtful of the Truth of this but if there appear any Proof of such a Fact I will drive him for ever from my Thoughts  Clo  Yes Madam Justice  Squeezum  will take care to have him driven another Way  Hil  Justice  Squeezum  let me hug you for that Information Now I can almost swear he is Innocent I have such an Adventure to surprize you with but let me not lose a Momentcome shew me the way  Clo  Poor Creature She knows the way to her Destruction too wellbut it would be Impertinence in a Servant to put her out of it  Aside  SCENE II  The Constable's House  Constant  alone  I begin to be of that Philosopher's Opinion who said that whoever will entirely consult his own Happiness must be little concerned about the Happiness of others Goodnature is Quixotism and every Princess  Micomicona  will lead her Deliverer into a Cage What had I to do to interpose What harm did the Misfortunes of an unknown Woman bring me that I should  hazard my own Happiness and Reputation on her AccountBut sure to swear a Rape against me for having rescued her from a Ravisher is an unparalelled Piece of Ingratitude  SCENE III  Constant  and Mrs  Staff  Mrs Staff  Will your Honour please to drink a Dram or some 'Rack Punch  Const  Dear Madam do not trouble me I can drink nothing  Mrs Staff  Truly Sir but I can Not trouble you I had never such a Customer here before You a Captain charged with a RapeI should sooner take you for some poor Attorney charged with Forgery and Perjury o a travelling Parson with stealing a Gown and Cassock  Const  Drink what you will and I'll pay what you please  Mrs Staff  Thank your Honour Your Honour will not be offended I hopewe stand at a great Rent and truly since this Gin Act Trade hath been so dull that I have often wished my Husband would live by the Highway himself instead of taking Highwaymen  Const  You are not the only Wife who would give her Husband this Advice I dare swear Nay were Men all so uxorious to take it  Tyburn  would have as much Business as  DoctorsCommons  Mrs Staff  I wish it had more for we must stand and fall by one another no business

Murder no Gentleman need be ashamed of and this is an honest BrotherRavisherI have ravished Women my self formerly but a Wife blunts a Man's Edge When once you are married you will leave off Ravishing I warrant youto be bound in Wedlock is as good a Security against Rapes as to be bound over to the Peace is against Murther  Mrs Staff  My Husband will have his Jest I hope your Honour will pardon him  Staff  But here is the Gentleman  SCENE V  Constant Ramble Staff  Mrs  Staff  Const  Prodigious  Ramb  Dear  Constant  Const  What in the Name of Wonder hath brought you to  England  Ramb  What in the Devil's Name hath brought thee to the  Constable  's    Const  Only a Rape Sir no dishonourable Offence as Mr  Constable  hath it  Ramb  You jest  Staff  No Sir upon my Word the Captain is in earnest  Ramb  Why I should sooner have suspected Ermin or LawnSleeves But I see Gravity and Hypocrisy are inseparableWell give me thy Hand Brother for our Fortunes agree exactly  Staff  And will agree in the End I don't question This is not the first time of their meeting together on this Account a Couple of old Whoremasters I warrant 'em  Aside  Mrs Staff  Will your Honours please to drink any Punch noble Captains it will keep up your Spirits  Staff  Don't force the Gentlemen Wife to drink whether they will or noI wish you well off this Affairin the mean time whatever my House affords is at your Serviceand let me assure you the more you drink the less you will lament your Misfortune  Ramb  Spoken like a true Philosopher  SCENE VI  Constant Ramble  Ramb  But dear  Billy  I hope thou hast not really committed hey  Const  What I heartily repent of I assure you I rescued a Woman in the Street for which she was so kind to swear a Rape against me but it gives me no Uneasiness equal to the Pleasure I enjoy in seeing you  Ramb  Ever kind and goodnatur'd  Const  Yet I wish our Meeting had been on another Occasion for the Freedom of your Life makes me suspect the Consequence of your Confinement may be heavier than mine  Ramb  I can't tell what the Consequence may be nor shall I trouble my self about it But I assure thee no sucking Babe can be more innocent If our Cases differ in any thing it is in this that my Woman hath not sworn  Const  This pleases me indeedBut pray how  came you to leave the  Indies  where I thought you had been settled for Life  Ramb  Why on the same Account that I went thither that I now am here by which I live and for which I live a Woman  Const  A Woman  Ramb  Ay a fine young rich Woman a Widow with Fourscore Thousand Pounds in her

Women we'll cut your Throat and toss Justice in a Murder into the Bargain  Sot  Not speak against Women you shall as soon compel me not to drink you shall sow up my Lips  if you do eitherHere you let the Punch be gotten ready  Staff  It shall an't please your Honour This Gentleman is a rare Customer to a House I wish he would commit a Rape too  Aside  SCENE VIII  Constant Ramble Sotmore  Const  You must not rail against the Ladies  Sotmore  before  Ramble  for he is a married Man  Ramb  And what is better my Wife is at the bottom of the Sea  Sot  And what is worse all her Effects are at the bottom of the Sea with her  Const  How  Ramb  Faith  Sotmore  hath spoken Truth for onceNotwithstanding my Pleasantry the Lady and her Fortune are both gone together she went to the other World Fourscore Thousand strong and if there be any such thing there I don't question but she is married again by this Time  Sot  You would not take my Advice I have cautioned thee never to trust any thing on the same Bottom with a Woman I would not ensure a Ship that had a Woman on Board for double the PriceThe Sins of one Woman are enough to draw down a Judgment on a Fleet  Ramb  Here's a Fellow who like a Prude makes Sin a Handle to his AbuseArt thou not ashamed to mention Sinwho art a Cargo of Iniquity why wilt thou fill thy venom'd Mouth with that of others when thou hast such Stores of thy own  Const  What occasioned your separating  Ramb  A Storm and my ill Stars I left the Ship wherein she was to dine with the Captain of one of our Convoy when a sudden violent Storm arising I lost sight of her Ship and from that Day have never seen or heard of her  Sot  Nor ever willI heartily hope Tho' as for the Innocent Chests those I wish deliver'd out of the  Deep But the Sea knows its own good It will be sure to keep the Money tho' possibly it may refund the Woman for a Woman will swim like a Cork and they are both of the same Value nay the latter is the more valuable as it preserves our Wine which Women often spoil  Const  Why  Sotmore  Wine is the Touchstone of all Merit with thee as Gold is to a Stockjobber and thou would'st as soon sell thy Soul for a Bottle as he for a Guinea  Sot  Wine Sir is as apt a Comparison to every thing that is good as Woman is to every thing that is bad  Const  Fie  Sotmore  this railing against the Ladies will make your Company as scandalous to Gentlemen as railing at Religion would to a Parson  Ramb  Right  Constant  they are my Religion I am the HighPriest of the Sex  Sot  Women and Religion Women and the Devil he leaves his Votaries in the Lurch and so do they  Const  I fancy  Ramble  this Friend of ours will turn Parson one day or other  Ramb  If he was not such a Sot I should think it possible  Sot  Why faith I am almost

the right It was not only a Whore but the most Impudent of all Whoresa modest Whore  Const  A modest Whore let her be married to an honest Attorney by all means  Ramb  And sent together to People His Majesty's Plantations  Sot  Modesty nowadays as often covers Impudence as it doth Ugliness It is as uncertain a sign of Virtue as Quality is or as fine Cloaths are of Quality  Ramb  Yet to do her Right the Persuasions of the Justice could not prevail with her to perjure herself  Sot  Conscientious Strumpet She hopes to pick your Pocket another time which it were Charity to thee to wish she might for if thou escapest this she certainly will have an Opportunity  Ramb  Pray honest  Nol  how didst thou find us out for a Boy would as soon have sent for his Schoolmaster when he was caught in an Orchard as I for thee on this Occasion  Sot  Find you out why the Town rings of youthere is not a Husband or Guardian in it but what is ready to get drunk for Joy If the Woman be not GoldProof she will be bribed to swear against you You are a Nusance Sir I don't believe he hath been in Town Six Days and he hath had above sixteen Women  Ramb  And they are a nobler Pleasure than so many Gallons which thou hast swallowed in that time  Sot  Sir I pay my Vintner and therefore do no Injury  Ramb  And Sir I do no Injury and therefore have no Reason to pay  Sot  Heyday is taking away a Man's Wife or Daughter no Injury  Ramb  Not when the Wife is weary of her Husband and the Daughter longs for one  Constant  Art thou not ashamed  Sotmore  to throw a Man's Sins in his Face while he is suffering for them  Sotm  That is the time Sir besides you see what an effect it hath on him you might as well rail at a Knight of the Post in the Pillory  Ramb  Let him alone the Punch will be here immediately

do I am sufficiently repayed by this Embrace  Const  I can never repay theeWould'st thou have given me Worlds it could not have equall'd the least Favour conferr'd on this Lady  Ramb  I should have conferred some Favours on her indeed if she would have accepted them  Aside  Hil  I am glad it is to Mr  Constant  's Friend I am obliged  Sotm  Yes you are damnably obliged to him for his Character of you  Aside  Const  My dear  Hilaret  shall I beg to hear it all I can have no Pleasure equal to finding new Obligations to this Gentleman  Hil  Since you desire it  Ramb  I fancy Madam your Fright at that time may have occasioned your forgetting some Circumstance therefore since Capt  Constant  desires it I will tell him the StoryI had just parted from this Gentleman when I heard a young Lady's Voice crying out for help I think the Word  Rape  was mentioned but that I cannot perfectly remember upon this making directly to the Place whence the Noise proceeded I found this Lady in the Arms of a very rude Fellow  Hil  The most impudent Fellow sure that ever was born  Ramb  A very impudent Fellow and yet a very cowardly one for the Moment I came up he quitted his Hold and was gone out of Sight in the Twinkling of an Eye  Const  My dear  Ramble  what hast thou done for me  Ramb  No Obligation dear  Constant  I would have done the same for any Man breathing But to proceed the Watch came up who would not be satisfied with what she then said but convey'd us both to the  RoundHouse  whence we were carried in the Morning before Justice  Squeezum  and by him notwithstanding this Lady's Protestations your humble Servant was committed to that Place where he now finds himself with this good Company  Const  Oh my FriendMay Heaven send me an Opportunity of serving thee in the same Manner  Ramb  May that be the only Prayer which it denies to  Constant  SCENE X  Constant Ramble Sotmore Hilaret Staff  Staff  The Punch is ready Gentlemen you may walk down the Liberty of my House is at your Service  Sotm  And that is Liberty enough while thou hast Punch here If thy House were a Sea of Punch I would not prefer any House in Town to it  Staff  Your Honour shall not want that  Sotm  And I shall want nothing more  Staff  Captain a Word with you  To  Ramble    There's Madam  Squeezum  below desires to speak with you alone  Ramb  Bring her up  Sotmore  you must excuse me a few Moments  Constant  and this Lady will entertain you  Sotm  Let the Moments be very few I'll lay Five Gallons to One this Fellow hath another Whore in his Eye  SCENE XI  Ramble  Mrs  Squeezum  Ramb  So my Affair with my Friend's Mistress is happily overThat I should not know a modest Woman But there is so great an Affectation of Modesty in some Women of the Town and so great an Affectation of Impudence in some Women of Fashion that it is not impossible to mistake Now for Mrs  Justice  her Business with me is not exceeding difficult to guess  Mrs Squeez  You will think I have a vast deal of Charity Captain who am not only the Solicitress of your Liberty at home to my Husband but can carry my Goodnature so far as to visit you in your Confinement I cannot say but I have a generous Pity for any one whom I imagine to be accused wrongfully  Ramb  I am obliged to you indeed Madam for that Supposal  Mrs Squeez  You are for the Cause of it Wherefore do you imagine I ventured my self alone with you this Morning  Ramb  From your great Humanity Madam  Mr Squeez  Alas Sir it was to try whether you were really the Man you were reported to be and I am certain I found you as inoffensive quiet civil wellbred a Gentleman as any virtuous Woman could have wished Your Behaviour was so modest that I can never imagine it possible you should have been guilty of a Rape No overgrown Alderman of Sixty or taper Beau of Six and Twenty could have been more innocent Company  Ramb  Whu  Aside  Mrs Squeez  Your then Carriage hath wrought so great an Effect upon me that I have ventured to trust my self here with you nay I could trust my self any where with so modest a Gentleman  Ramb  I'll take care Madam never to forfeit your good Opinion of me you may trust your self with me any where I'll never behave in any other manner than becomes the bestbred Man alive with the bestbred Lady I swear by this soft Hand these Lips and all the Millions of Charms that dwell in this dear Body  Mrs Squeez  What do you mean  Ramb  I know not what I mean Tongue can't express nor Thought conceivewe can only feel the exquisite Pleasures Love has in store  Mrs Squeez  Nay I protest and vow  Ramb  Protestations are as vain as Struggling This Closet hath a Bed in it that would not disgrace a Palace  Sotm  At the Door  Why  Ramble Jack Ramble  Art thou not ashamed to leave thy Friends thus for some little dirty Strumpet If thou dost not come immediately we'll break open the Door and drown her in Punch  Mrs Squeez  Softly  I am undone  Ramb  Fear nothingGo to your Bowl I'll come this Instant  Sotm  I'll not wag without you  Ramb  Then I'll come down break your Bowl and spill all your Liquor  Sot  Bring thy Whore along with thee there's one there already she'll be glad of her Company If you don't come in an Instant I will be back again  Mrs Squeez  What shall I do  Ramb  My Angel Love shall instruct thee  Mrs Squeez  Let me gosome other timeI will not run any Venture here  Ramb  I will not part with you  Mrs Squeez  You shall hear from me in half an Hour You shall have your Liberty and I'll appoint you where to meet me  Ramb  Shall I depend on you  Mrs Squeez  You mayAdieuDon't follow me I can slip out a back Way  Ramb  Farewel my Angel  SCENE XII  Ramble  Solus  Confound this drunken Rascal This is not the first Time he hath spoiled an Intrigue for me But hold as I am to have my Liberty beforehand I don't think this half Hour's Delay at all unlucky That Consideration may sufficiently compensate the staying of my Stomach This Adventure of mine begins to put on a tolerable Aspect An Intrigue with a rich Justice's Wife is not to be slighted by a young Fellow of a desperate Fortune I do not doubt but in a very short Time when I am taken up for the next Rape to bribe the Justice with his own MoneyLend a Man your Gold he may forget the Debt venture your Life for him he may forget the Obligation but once engage his Wife and you secure his Friendship There is no Friend in all Extremity so sure as your  Cuckoldand the surest Hold you can take of a Man as of a Bull is by his Horns  SCENE XIII  Ramble Constant Sotmore Hilaret  Sotm  Ha what's become of thy Wench if thou hadst none thy Absence was the more inexcusable  Const  O  Ramble  this our better Genius hath invented the most notable PlotSuch a Net is laid for the Justice it will at once entangle him and disentangle us Mr  Hoggshead  here is to play his Part too  Ramb  I am sorry we cannot do without him for should there be any Claret in his way he'd disappoint the whole Affair for one Bottle  Sotm  Not for the best  Burgundy  in  France  This Lady hath won my Heart by one BumperBy all the Pleasures of Drinking Madam I like you more than your whole Sex put together There is no Honesty in Man or Woman that will not drink Honesty is tried in Wine as Gold is in the Fire Madam you have made a Conquest of me I'll drink your Health as long as I can stand and that's as long as a reasonable Woman can require  Hil  I am exceedingly proud of my Conquest over a Man of Mr  Sotmore  's good Sense  Const  Upon my Word you may you are the first Woman I believe he ever was civil to  Sotm  It was because they none of them had your Merit a Parcel of Teadrinking SlutsIf I had a Daughter that drank Tea I would turn her out of Doors The Reason that Men are honester than Women is their Liquors are stronger If the Sex were bred up to Brandy and Tobacco if they all liked Drinking as well as you seem to do Madam I should turn a Lover  Ramb  Why  Constant  such another Compliment would make thee jealous  Hil  Upon my Word he hath Reason already  Sotm  Madam I like you and if a Bottle of  Burgundy  were on one side and you on the other I do not know which I should chuse  Const  Thou would'st chuse the Bottle I am sure  Ramb  But I long to hear this Conspiracy  Sotm  Then it must be below I strictly forbid any Secrets to be told but at the CouncilTable The Rose is ever understood over the DrinkingRoom and a Glass is the surest Turnkey to the Lips  Const  That's contrary to the Opinion of Philosophers  Sotm  Of the sober ones it may but all your wise Philosophers were a Set of the most drunken Dogs alive I never knew a sober Fellow but was an Assand your Ass is the soberest of all Animals Your sober Philosophers and their Works have been buried long ago I remember a Saying of that great Philosopher and Poet  Horace  who wrote in  Falernian  instead of Ink  No Verses lastcan long escape the Night  Which the dull scribling Waterdrinkers write  Exeunt  ACT IV  SCENE I  SCENE  Squeezum  's  Squeezum Quill  Squeez  YOU delivered my Letter  Quill  Yes an't please your Worship I left it at the CoffeeHouse where she directed me  Squeez  Very well  Quill  Quill  Sir  Squeez  I think I may trust thee with any Secretand what I am now going to tell will shew thee what  a Confidence I put in theeIn short  Quill  I suspect my Wife  Quill  Of what Sir  Squeez  I am afraid that I am not the only Person free with her and that I am free of the Corporation of Cuckolds  Quill  Then your Worship is free of all the Corporations in  England  Squeez  Now thou knowest that there are very wholesome Laws against Cuckoldom the Advantage of a Man's Horns is that he may shove his Wife out of Doors with them  Quill  And that is no inconsiderable Advantage  Squeez  But there must be a Discovery first It is not enough that a Man knows himself to be a Cuckold the World must know it too He that will keep his Horns in his Pocket must keep his Wife in his Bosom Therefore  Quill  as it is in your Power to observe my Wife I assure you a very handsome Reward on her Conviction for I begin to find that if I do not discover her she will shortly discover me or ruin me by bribing her to hold her Tongue It is not a little Gold will make a Gag for a Woman  Quill  Sir I shall be as diligent as possible  Squeez  And I as liberal on your Success  Exit  Squeezum  SCENE II  Quill  solus  Indeed Justice that Bait will not do I know you too well to trust to your Liberality Your Wife will reward Services better than you Besides I have too much Honour to take Fees on both SidesAnd since I am her Pimp in ordinary I'll go like an honest and dutiful Servant and discover this Conspiracy for should she once be turn'd out of the Family I should make but a slender Market of this closefinger'd Justice whose Covetousness would suffer no Rogues to live but himself  SCENE III  The Constable's House  Ramble Constant  Ramb  This little Mistress of yours is the most dextrous Politician if that drunken Puppy doth not disappoint us  Const  Never fear him he hath Cunning enough and there hath been so long a War in his Head between Wine and his Senses that they seem now to have come to an Agreement that he is never to be quite in them nor ever quite out of them his Life is one continued Scene of being half Drunk  Ramb  Well as we can be of no farther Use in the Affair but must stay here and expect the Issue pr'ythee tell me what hath become of you these three long long Years since you quitted the Service of the  EastIndia  Company and came over to  England  with  Sotmore  Const  Why at my first Return to  England  the Prospect of War was in every one's Eye and not only the Reports of the People but the Augmentation of the Troops assured us of its Approach upon which I resolved to embarque my small Remains of Fortune in the Service of my Country and obtained the same Commission on that Occasion which I had enjoyed in the  Indies  My History is not very full of Adventures I continued therein 'till the Reduction when I shared the Fate of several unhappy brave Fellows and was sent a begging with a red Coat on my Back  Ramb  It is the Faculty of the Cloth to be raggedRed is as apt to be ragged as White to be soil'd It is commonly the Fate of our brave Soldiers to bring home ragged Cloaths as well as Colours and both are rewarded by  WestminsterHall  the one is hung up in it and the other is locked up safe by an Order from it for Heaven be prais'd the Goals are always open Hospitals for us  Const  The only Happiness which hath attended me since my Return is my having contracted an Intimacy with that young Lady whom you saw here which hath proceeded so far that last Night we had appointed to meet in order to our Marriage but as I was just arrived at the Place a Woman welldress'd was attacked in the Street by a Russian I immediately flying to her Assistance the Fellow quitted her and left me alone in the Possession of the Watch who early this Morning carried me before Justice  Squeezum  and by him I was committed hither  Ramb  What did she appear against you  Const  No they said she was ill of some Bruises she had received but desired I might be kept in Custody 'till the Afternoon at which Time she would appear against me But by what  Hilaret  hath told us and by some Methods which have been used to extort Money from me I am inclined to fancy it all a contrived Piece of Villany of the Justice and not of the Woman's as I at first imagined  Ramb  Be assured of itif there be Roguery the Justice hath the chief Part in it But comfort your self with the Expectation of Revenge for I think he cannot possibly escape the Net we have spread unless the Devil have more Gratitude than he is reported to have and will assist his very good Friend at a Crisis  Const  But what do you intend in  England  where you have no Friends  Ramb  I know not yet whether I have or no I left an old Father here and a rich one He thought fit to turn me out of Doors for some Frolicks which it is probable if he yet lives he may have forgiven me by this But what's become of him I know not for I have not heard one Word of him these Ten Years  Const  I think you have been vastly careless in neglecting him so long  Ramb  'Tis as I have acted in all Affairs of Life my Thoughts have ever succeeded my Actions the  Consequence hath caused me to reflect when it was too late I never reasoned on what I should do but what I had done as if my Reason had her Eyes behind and could only see backwards  SCENE IV  Ramble Constant Staff  Staff  Here is a Letter for your Honour  Ramb  Reads it  Ay this is a Letter indeed  Const  What is it  Ramb  My Freedom under a Sign manual from the Queen of these Regions  Const  Explain  Ramb  Then Sir in plain  English  without either Trope or Figure it is a Letter from the Justice's Wife with an Order to the Constable for my Liberty  Reads  SIR  I Was no sooner recovered of the Fright which that unmannerly Friend of yours occasioned than I have performed my Promise you will find me at Home the Constable hath Orders by the Bearer to acquit you  Here's Goodnature for you  Kisses the Letter  Thou dear Wife of a damn'd Rogue of a Justice I fly to thy Arms  Const  Heark'e suppose you brought her to be a Witness to our Designandhere take this Letter of Assignation from the Justice to  Hilaret  it will give your Discovery Credit  Ramb  An admirable Thought I fly to execute it Dear  Constant  goodmorrow I hope when next we meet we shall meet  In happier Climes and on a safer Shore  Where no vile Justice shall invade us more  Const  Success attend you  Exeunt  SCENE V  A Tavern  Squeezum Drawer  Squeez  No Woman been to enquire for Mr  Jones  Draw  Sir I know of none but I'll ask at the Bar if you please  Squeez  Doand leave Word if any such comes to shew her up hitherI have no Reason to doubt her Company but I am impatient for it I protest this Woman hath revived the Vigour of Youth in me sure I must have overreckoned my YearsI cannot be above FortyNine at the mostI wish this dear Girl was comeI am afraid I did wrong in giving her those Five Shillings in a Purse worth above Two Shillings more which who knows but she may be spending on some Bully who will perhaps send another Present to me in return  SCENE VI  Squeezum Hilaret  Squeez  Oh are you comeyou little pretty dear sweet RogueI have been waiting for you thesethese four Hours at least  Hil  Young Lovers are commonly earlier than their Appointment  Squeez  Give me a Kiss for thatThou shalt find me a young Lover a vigorous young Lover tooHit me a Slap in the Face doBowwow Bowwow I'll eat up your CloathsCome what will you drink White or RedWomen love White bestBoy bring half a Pint of  Mountain  Come sit down do sit downCome now let us hear the Story how you were first debauchedComethat I may put it down in my History at Home I have the History of all the Women's Ruin that ever I lay with and I call it  The History of my own Times  Hil  I'll warrant it is as big as a ChurchBible  Squeez  It is really of a good reputable Size I have done Execution in my Time  Hil  And may do Execution still  Boy  Without  Half a Pint of Mountain in the  Lion  score  Squeez  WellBut now let me have the HistoryWhere did your Amour beginat Church I warrant you more Amours begin at Church than end thereOr perhaps you went to see the Man of WarGoing to see Sights hath ruined many a Woman No wonder Children are Lovers of them since so many owe their Being to them  Hil  Aside  I thank you for that remembrance I had forgot my LoverAy Sir it was there indeed I saw him first that was the fatal Scene of our Interview  Squeez  Well and was the Amour managed by Letter or by word of Mouth  Hil  By Letter Sir I believe he writ two Quires of Paper to me before I would send him an Answer I returned him several unopened and then several others openedBut at lasthe obtained an Answer  Squeez  Well and after your Answer what followed then  Hil  Oh he thought himself sure of me as soon as I had answered his Letter  Squeez  Ay I have always observed in my Amours that when I received an Answer I never failed of the Woman a Woman follows her Letter infallibly well and what did he say in the second Letter  Hil  Oh he swore a thousand fond things that his Love should last as long as his Life That his whole Happiness depended on meand a vast deal of that Nature  Squeez  Ay ay just as I have done my self I find Whoring is as Methodical as the Law  Hil  And I fancy as tedious with you old Gentle man  Aside  Squeez  Well and how many Letters did you write to him eybefore  Hil  Not many He did not want much Encouragement  Squeez  Then passing over the rest of the Suit let us come to the last fatal Meeting  Hil  It was of a  Sunday  Morning  Squeez  Right My old method When other People are gone to Church  Hil  In an exceeding hot Day  Squeez  May  or  June  Women and Cherries are commonly gathered in the same Month  Hil  I was fatigued with walking in the Garden and retired to an Arbour to repose my self guess what was my Surprize when I found the dear Perfidious had convey'd himself thither before me  Squeez  A sly Dog My old way again An Ambush is as useful in Love as War  Hil  At my first Entrance he pretended a Surprize at seeing me unexpectedly but on my questioning him how and with what Design he had conveyed himself there he immediately threw off the Cloak and confessed all he flew to me caught me in his Arms with the most eager Raptures and swore the most violent Love and eternal Constancy I in the greatest Agony of Rage repelled him with my utmost Force he redoubled his Attacks I slackened my Resistance he entreated I raved he sighed I cry'd he pressed I swooned he  Squeez  OhI can bear no longer my Angel my Paradise my Honeysuckle my Dove my Darling  Hil  What do you mean Sir  Squeez  I mean to eat you up to swallow you down to squeeze you to Pieces  Hil  Help there a Rape a Rape  SCENE VII  Squeezum Hilaret Sotmore  Sotm  Heyday what in the Devil's name is hereJustice  Squeezum  ravishing a Woman  Hil  Oh for Heaven's sake Sir assist a poor forlorn hapless Maid whom this wicked Man hath treacherously seduced  Squeez  Oh ludOh lud  Sotm  Fie upon you Mr  Squeezum  you who are a Magistrate you who are the Preserver and Executor of our Laws thus to be the Breaker of them  Squeez  Can'st thou accuse me  Hil  You know too well how barbarously you have used me For Pity's sake Sir secure him do not let him escape 'till we send for a Constable If there be any Law for a

never happened but you must go a Whoring with a Pox to you at your Years too with these spindle Shanks that weezle Face that Crane's Neck of a Body Who would have imagined that such an old withered Maypole as thou art should attempt to fall on a Woman Why thou wilt be the Diversion of the whole Town  Grubstreet  will dine a Month on your Account Thou wilt be ushered to  Tyburn  with more Pomp then  Alexander  was ushered into  Babylon  Justice never triumphs so universally as at the Execution of one of her own Officers  Squeez  Sir if there be Truth on Earth I am as innocent  Sotm  All the Innocence on Earth will not save youA Man doth not always draw the Rope by the weight of his Sins Your Innocence will not acquit you in a Court of Justice against her Oath and when you come to the Gallows it will be vain to plead your Innocence All's Fish that comes to the Net there The Gallows so seldom gets its due that it never parts with what it gets  Hil  Can you pretend to Innocence was not this Gentleman an Eyewitness to your Rudeness to the Injuries you offered me  Sotm  Ay ay I can swear to the Rape with as safe a Conscience as I can drink a Glass of Wine  Squeez  I see I am betrayed I am caught in my own Trap There is but one way to escape which is the way I have opened to others  Aside  I see Madam your Design is to extort Money from me I am too well acquainted with the Laws to contend but I hope you will be reasonable for I am poor very poor I assure you it is not for Men of my Honesty to be rich  Hil  Sir if you would give me Millions it should not satisfie my Revenge you shall be hanged for an Example to others  Squeez  Here's a cruel Wretch who prefers my Blood to my Gold which is almost my Blood  Sotm  Heyday what Vehicle is this a Vinegar Bottlehalf a

you lose no Time but send for the Constable immediately  Squeez  I'll do any thing I'll consent to any Terms  Hil  The Constable the Constable  Squeez  Stay dear Sir I'll give you a hundred Guineas I'll do any thing  Hil  Remember your vile Commitment of two Gentlemen this MorningBut I will revenge the Injuries of my FriendsSir I beseech you send for the Officers  Squeez  One is already dismissed from his Confinement and the other shall be dismissed immediately  Hil  It is too late  Sotm  Hearkee Sir will you leave off Whoring and take to Drinking for the future  Squeez  I'll leave them off both  Sotm  Then you shall be hanged but if you will commence honest Fellow and get drunk every Day of your Life I'll intercede with this Lady that on your acquitting the Gentleman you shall be acquitted your self  Squeez  I'll do any thing I'll quit any thing  Sotm  Madam let me persuade you to be merciful this time to this unfortunate and undutiful Servant of Justice  Hil  Sir I can deny you nothing  Squeez  Get me a Pen and Ink I'll send an Order to bring him hither and discharge him instantly  Sotm  Drawer bring Pen Ink and Paper and a Bottle of old Port  Squeez  to  Hil    And

managed this Matter so well that I shall have an Opinion of your Sex's Understanding ever after  Hil  Let a Woman alone for a Plot Mr  Sotmore  Sot  Ay Madam a Woman that will drink a Bumper Wine is the Fountain of Thought and  The more we drink  The more we think  It is a Question with me whether Wine hath done more Good or Physick Harm in the World I would have every Apothecary's Shop in the Town turn'd into a Tavern  Hil  I am afraid the more you have of the one the more you will require of the other  Sot  It is their Drugs that debauch our Wine Wine in it self is as innocent as Water and Physick poisons both It is not the Juice of the Grape but of the Drug that is pernicious Let me advise you Madam leave off your damn'd adulterated Water your Tea and take to Wine It will paint

to bestow on him Yet I must own the Girl hath been ever dutiful to me till she became acquainted with this cursed Fellow in a Red Coat Why should Red have such Charms in the Eyes of a Woman The  Roman  Senate kept their Armies abroad to prevent their sharing in their Lands at home we should do the same to prevent their sharing in our Wives A tall lusty Fellow shall make more work for a Midwife in one Winter at home than he can for a Surgeon in ten Summers abroad  SCENE II  Politick Faithful  Pol  Well any News of my Daughter yet  Faith  No Sir but there is some News from the Secretaries Office a Mail is arrived from  Holland  and you will have the Contents of it in one of the Evening Papers  Pol  Very well I must be patient I think we have three Mails together now I am not satisfied at all with the Affairs in the North The Northern Winds have not blown us any Good lately the Clouds are a little darker in the East too than I could wish them  SCENE III  Politick Dabble  Pol  Mr  Dabble  good Morrow  Dab  Are the Mails come in  Pol  Just arrived  Dab  I have not slept one wink for reflecting on what you told me last Night perhaps this  Dutch  Mail may give some Insight into those Affairs But what says the  LyingPost  Pol  I have had no time to read it yet I wish you would I have only read  The London Journal    the Country Journal    the Weekly Journal  Applebee  's Journal    the  British  Journal    the  British  Gazeteer    the Morning Post    the CoffeeHouse Morning Post    the Daily Post    the Daily PostBoy    the Daily Journal    the Daily Courant    the Gazette  the  Evening Post    the  Whitehall  Evening Post    the  London  Evening Post    and the  St James  's Evening Post  So if you please begin the  Lying Post  Dab  reads  Moscow    January  the fifth 'We learn from  Constantinople  that Affairs continue still in the same doubtful way it is not yet known what Course our Court will take The Empress having been slightly indisposed the other Day took the Air in her own Coach and returned so well recovered that she eat a very hearty Supper'  Pol  Humthere is no mention of the Supper in any other Papers  Dab  Berlin    January  the th 'We hear daily Murmurs here concerning certain Measures taken by a certain Northern Potentate but cannot certainly learn either who that Potentate is or what are the Measures which he hath takenmean time we are well assured that Time will bring them all to light'  Pol  Pray read that last over again  Dab  'Mean time we are well assured that Time will bring them all to light'  Pol  Hum hum  Dab  Marseilles    January  the th 'The Affairs in regard to  Italy  continue still in the same uncertain Condition'  Pol  Hum  Dab  'The Talk of a large Embarkation still runs high'  Pol  Hum  Dab  'The  Spaniards  continue still encamped near  Barcelona  '  Pol  Hum  Shakes his Head  Dab  'And every thing seems tending to a Rupturemean time we expect the Return of a Courier from  Vienna  who 'tis generally expected will bring the News of a general Pacification'  Pol  All is well again  Dab  I like this and some other Papers who disappoint you with good News Where the beginning of a Paragraph threatens you with War and the latter part of it ensures you Peace  Pol  Please to read on  Dab  'However notwithstanding these Assurances 'tis doubted by most People whether the said Courier will not rather bring a Confirmation of the War but this is all guesswork and till such time as we see an actual Hostility committed we must leave our Readers in the same uncertain State we found them'  Pol  Hum There is no Certainty to be come at I find it may be either Peace or War  Dab  Tho' were I to lay a Wager I should chuse War for if you observe we are twice assured of that whereas we have only one Affirmation on the side of Peacebut stay perhaps the next Paragraph which is dated from  Fontainbleau  may decide the Question '  Fontainbleau    January  Yesterday his Majesty went a Hunting today he hears an Opera and tomorrow he hears Mass'  Pol  I don't like that hearing Mass is seldom the Forerunner of good News  Dab  ' It is observable that Cardinal  Fleury  '  Pol  Ay now for it  Dab  'It is observable that Cardinal  Fleury  hath for several Days last past been in close Conference with the Minister of a certain State which causes various Speculations but as we do not know what was the Matter in Debate we cannot say what may be the Consequence thereof Mean time we cannot help observing that it hath occasioned some People to put on very serene Looks who had worn cloudy ones for some time before Some imagine on comparing this with the News from  Marseilles  that a War will be unavoidableothers who are more peaceably inclined are as strenuous Advocates on the other sideWe must refer the whole to the Determination of Time that great Judge in worldly Affairs who never fails with his twoedged Scithe to mow down the Weeds which shadow over the secret Counsels of State and lay them open to the naked Eye of the discerning Politician'  Pol  Shall I beg to hear that over again  SCENE IV  Politick Dabble Faithful  Dab  reads  'We must refer the whole to the Determination'  c

Truth in it so Neighbour  Dabble  you will excuse me I will meet you within an Hour at the Coffeehouse and there we will confer farther  SCENE V  Worthy  's House  Worthy Isabella  Wor  Sure Modesty is quite banished from the Age we live in There was a time when Virtue carried something of a divine Awe with it which no one durst attack but now the Insolence of our Youth is such no Woman dare walk the Streets but those who do it for Bread  Isa  And yet our Laws Brother  Worthy  are as rigorous as those of other Countries and as well executed  Wor  That I wish they were but Golden Sands too often clog the Wheels of Justice and obstruct her Course The very Riches which were the greatest Evidence of his Villany have too often declared the Guilty innocent and Gold hath been found to cut a Halter surer than the sharpest Steel  Isa  Well I am resolved to take care how I venture a step again after it is dark I find the Sun is the only Guard to us Women for however chaste the Moon may be in her self she takes but very little care of ours  Wor  But could the Villain be very rude  Isa  As rude as so short a time would permit I would have given all I was worth in the World to have been here but since I escaped let us forget it  Wor  Forget By Heaven it shocks me that we who boast as wholsome Laws as any Kingdom upon Earth should by the Roguery of some of their Executors lose all their Benefit I long to see the time when here as in  Holland  the Traveller may walk unmolested and carry his Riches openly with him  SCENE VI  Worthy Isabella Squeezum  Squeez  Mr  Worthy  your

is a Conspiracy against me against my self What do you think Brother  Worthy  but that moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil a vile Woman hath conspired to swear a Rape against me  Wor  A Rape against you foolish Jade Why your very Face would acquit youyou have Innocence in your Looks Brother  Squeezum  Squeez  I hope my Character will acquit me against such an Accusation  Wor  I think

no more but I think it incumbent on us all to discountenance any Prosecution of our selves on any Account whatsoever  Wor  To discountenance it by the Innocence of our Lives is indeed laudable but no farther It is a cursed Law which exempts the Maker or the Executor of it from its Penalty  Squeez  Truly Brother  Worthy  I think the Makers of Laws and the Executors of them should be free of them as Authors and Actors are free of the Playhouse  Wor  You are ludicrous Mr  Squeezum  But let me tell you he is the greatest of Villains who hath the Impudence to hold the Sword of Justice while he

Discharge of two Gentlemen whom he had villanously committed to the Custody of that Constable  Wor  For what Crimes do they stand committed Mr Constable  Staff  For two Rapes an't please your Worship
