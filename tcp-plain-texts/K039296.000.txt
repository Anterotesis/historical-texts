 LUCIUS THE FIRST Christian King of  Britain  A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL in  DruryLane  BY His MAJESTY's Servants  By Mrs  MANLEY  LONDON Printed for  John Barber  on  Lambethhill  and sold by  Benj Tooke  at the MiddleTemple Gate  Henry Clements  in St  Paul's  Churchyard and  John Walthoe  jun overagainst the  Royal Exchange Cornhill  TO Sir  RICHARD STEELE  WHEN Men cast their Eyes upon Epistles of this Kind from the Name of the Person who makes the Address and of Him who receives it they usually have Reason to expect Applauses improper either to be given or accepted by the Parties concern'd I fear it will at first Sight be much more so in this Address than any other which has at any Time appear'd but while common Dedications are stuff'd with painful Panegyricks the plain and honest Business of this is only to do an Act of Justice and to End a former Misunderstanding between the Author and Him whom She here makes Her Patron In Consideration that one knows not how far what We have said of each other may affect our Character in the World I take it for an Act of Honour to declare on my Part that I have not known a greater Mortification than when I have reflected upon the Severities which have flow'd from a Pen which is now You see dispos'd as much to celebrate and commend You On Your Part Your sincere Endeavour to promote the Reputation  and Success of this TRAGEDY are infallible Testimonies of the Candour and Friendship you retain for Me I rejoice in this publick Retribution and with Pleasure acknowledge That I find by Experience that some useful Notices which I had the good Fortune to give You for Your Conduct in former Life with some hazard to my Self were not to be blotted out of Your Memory by any Hardships that follow'd them  I KNOW You so well that I am assur'd You already think I have on this Subject said too much and I am confident You believe of Me that did I not conceal much more I should not say so much Be then the very Memory of disagreeable Things forgotten for ever and give Me leave to Thank You for Your Kindness to this PLAY and in return to shew towards Your Merit the same Goodwill But when my Heart is full and my Pen ready to express the kindest Sentiments to Your Advantage I reflect upon what I have formerly heard You say That the Fame of a Gentleman like the Credit of a Merchant must flow from his own intrinsick Value and that all Means to enlarge it which do not arise naturally from That real Worth instead of promoting the Character of either did but lessen and render it suspicious I leave You therefore to the great Opportunities which are daily in Your Power of bestowing on Your Self what no Body else can give You and wishing You Health and Prosperity I omit to dwell upon some very late  Actions of Yours in Publick which unhappy Prejudices made as little expected from You as the Zeal and Sollicitude which You shew'd for my private Interests in the Success of this PLAY I shall say no more trusting to the Gallantry of Your Temper for further Proofs of Friendship and allowing You like a true Woman all the good Qualities in the World now I am Pleas'd with You as well as I gave You all the ill One's when I was Angry with You I remain with the greatest Truth  SIR  Your most humble most faithful and most oblig'd Servant De la Rivier Manley  THE PREFACE  I  Cannot suffer this  PLAY  to pass into the World without expressing my Gratitude to the Ladies who in such a distinguishing Manner graced and supported it So much Beauty and good Nature could not fail of rend'ring that Person happy for whose Benefit they were employ'd I think my self infinitely bless'd in their Smiles since I can be sensible of no greater Glory than to hear that I have had the Honour to Please Them  TO tell the World that Mr  Booth  and Mrs  Oldfield's  Action was admirable in the Parts of  LUCIUS  and  ROSALINDA  is saying nothing New they are so us'd to Charm the Audience and Delight the best Judges of the Theatre However I beg leave to make them my publick Acknowledgments and to please my self with what I have heard reported of their Performance in this  PLAY  which is That tho' they have  often shin'd in several greater Parts yet none ever became them better Mr  Booth's  masterly and graceful Action supported  LUCIUS  whilst Mrs  Oldfield's  Charms and enchanting Manner gave Life and Beauty to the  QUEEN  PROLOGUE  By Sir RICHARD STEELE  NAT Lee  for Buskins fam'd would often say  To StageSuccess He had a certain Way  Something for all the People must be done  And with some Circumstance each Order won  This He thought easy as to make a Treat  And for a Tragedy gave this Receipt  Take me said He a Princess Young and Fair  Then take a Blooming Victor flush'd with War  Let Him not owe to vain Report Renown  But in the Ladies Sight cut Squadrons down  Let Him whom they themselves saw win the Field  Him to whose Sword they saw whole Armies yield  Approach the Heroin with dread Surprise  And own no Valour Proof against bright Eyes  The Boxes are Your ownthe Thing is hit  And Ladies as they near each other sit  Cry oh  How movingly that Scene is writ  For all the Rest with Ease Delights you'll sbape  Write for the Heroes in the Pit a  Rape  Give the First Gallery a  Ghost  on th' Upper  Bestow tho' at that distance a good  Supper  Thus all their Fancies working their own Way  They're Pleas'd and think they owe it to the Play  But the Ambitious Author of these Scenes  With no low Arts to court your Favour means  With Her Success and Disappointment move  On the just Laws of Empire and of Love  PROLOGUE  By a Young GENTLEMAN  Spoken by Mr Walker  IN ancient Days the Time we do not know  It is so very very long ago  Envy  was forc'd to lead an harmless Life  To stay at home a meer  Italian  Wife  Wou'd ye believe it Ladies Tet 'tis true  She had not learn'd to Dress like One of Tou  Nor did she then appear a thoughtless Beau  Nor wore Cockades nor into Armies go  To Playhouses she ne'er presum'd to come  And rarely visited the Drawingroom  Ev'n Masquerades where no One shews the Face  Would not admit of  Envy  in the Place  Ah happy Days when Dulness fear'd no Lash  The Author gave no Wit yet got his Cash  When an Attempt to Please was taken well  And on weak Woman never Critick fell  But our new Taste brings on a new Demand  For Wit alone at present cannot stand  You must have Scandal Politicks and Traps  To raise the Ladies Blush and Footmens Claps  What can poor We expect in such a Case  Dare  English  Tragedy plead Hopes of Grace  No Party favour'd no Designs in view  To make Old Times club Faction with the New  No  double  soft  Entenders  to excite  No Politicks to please the Wise to Night  Such a dull Play could any Modern write  Alas we own the Allegation just  But 'tis to You the shining Fair we trust  As You are Fair our Author hopes to find  You can Forgive and then You will be Kind  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HOnorius

with secret Sorrow mourn  Why thus averse to every Sound of Joy  When  Fortune  crowns you with her choicest Favours  Makes you the Soldiers Pride and Wish of Beauty  The coldest Maid that ever grac'd a Court  At your approach drops all her haughty Airs  New rolls her Eyes new coins her Face in Smiles  And her longpractis'd Scorn is then no more  Luc  O  Albany  I cannot bear thy search  Arm  I must proceed and name the beauteous Queen  Luc  Ha say'st thou What of her  Arminius  Arm  The mourning  Rosalind  in Sorrow dress'd  Can charm beyond the gaudy Smiles of others  Luc  I view indeed the captive Queen with Pity  Arm  My Friend does she not rule thy Soul  Luc  She does she does my charming Queen reigns here  Triumphant in her native Throne my Heart  Diffusive is her Sway War yields to Love  Nor know I any Wish but for her Beauty  Arm  Oh sure Despair as certain Death for me  Aside  Luc  Why sighs my Friend Is she not heav'nly Fair  Arm  Oh Guardian Powers of  Britain  save him now  Oh save the lovely Youth from pleasing Ruin  Hast thou forgot alas the Queen's a Christian  Apostate to our Altars and our Worship  Luc  In her alone all my Devotion centers  My Heart when I such wond'rous Charms survey  In her adores the Allcreating Power  Nor can Perfections great as hers mislead  She cannot be mistaken cannot err  Or if she cou'd with  Rosalind  to err  Were better than believing with another  Arm  Beware the Mischiefs which attend her Love  Thy Father styl'd the cruel King of  Britain  Is to the Christian Sect a most invet'rate Foe  Luc  Love were not Love cou'd it admit of Fear  Arm  Think how when Lord of  Verulam  he slew  The good the rightful Majesty of  Britain  Slew at a peaceful Banquet that brave Monarch  The Queen scarce up from Childbed of a Son  Who soon expir'd he forc'd to his loath'd Bed  In hopes the Prince of  Cambria  her Brother  Wou'd prove a Friend to his bold Usurpation  And yet Heav'n smil'd upon the horrid Nuptials  And bless'd the Tyrant with the Godlike  Lucius  Luc  Tho' sprung from one I have no Tyrant's Soul  Am I to blame Cou'd I direct my Birth  Cou'd I concur to Be Was the Choice mine  My Mother early paid the Debt of Nature  Of me she dy'd may that attone the Crime  Of wedding with her Husband's Murderer  Arm  Still there's a Secret will thy Hopes destroy  Thy Father does himself the Queen adore  His Love began soon after thou wert sent  To aid the  Gallick  King against his Brother  Luc  O fatal War wou'd I had never seen it  Arm  Thy Father at a Royal Interview  Receiv'd a Dart from  Rosalinda's  Eyes  The beauteous Heiress of my Uncle's Crown  Then to the King of  Aquitain  betroth'd  He strove in vain to cross the promis'd Nuptials  For his own Bed courting the destin'd Bride  Long Enmity between the  Picts  and  Britons  Their native Hate and Contract with  Otharius  Caus'd the Refusal of your Father's Suit  Luc  The Fame of this Affront reach'd us abroad  Arm  Love was the secret Motive of the War  Hence he invaded  Albany  with Fury  And with my Uncle's Death the Slight reveng'd  How has he gall'd the  Picts  with heavy Yokes  How every Day oppress'd our conquer'd People  How in these foreign Wars and distant Climes  Forc'd us for him to carry hated Arms  Eager to prosecute his furious Love  He cross'd the Seas to make the Queen a Widow  Too well his Chance in War succeeded here  Otharius  he was slain and we the Victors  Luc  This Morning with the  Gallick  King he comes  Triumphant o'er the Fate of  Aquitain  Arm  Soon as your conqu'ring Arms had forc'd this City  With Orders I was sent to plead his Love  But she with Indignation has refus'd him  I dread to say how ill I have succeeded  His Tyrant Temper will not yield to Reason  Nor can the Name of Son abate his Rage  Cure or conceal your Love or you are lost  Luc  Conceal my Love conceal a raging Fire  Conceal the Blaze when it invades the Sky  As well unbounded Storms may be conceal'd  Arm  Sure this Etherial Fire was struck by  Jove  Oh no the God of Love has greater force  He animates you thus thus moves your Frame  And brings inimitable Graces with him  Feels not the Queen the Force of all those Charms  A Dawn of Joy breaks from her gath'ring Smiles  With all the Softness which foreruns her Sex's Yielding  Luc  Ten Months I've offer'd ineffectual Vows  Ten Months pursu'd the Fair with ardent Love  No morethe Princess  Emmelin  appears  I'll go this very Hour and urge my Fate  Ere my stern Father comes I must be bless'd  Be ever bless'd or else for ever wretched  Haste all ye Loves and Graces to my aid  Dwell on my Voice and languish in my Eyes  Bright  Cytherea  from thy Heav'n look down  Grant  Venus  grant that I her Heart may move  For me thy Slave make her thy Votary  Propitious now thou shalt my Goddess be  And I'll Devote my happy Hours to thee    Exit  Luc  Enter the Princess  Emmelin  Emm  I met the Princehow has thy search succeeded  Arm  Alas too well  Emm  And grows the Hero  Lucius  sick for Love  That stubborn Heart in Camps and Slaughter bred  Unus'd to Beauty and its soft Delights  Oh Sympathy of Sex oh Force of Nature  What haughty Victor stops not at thy Call  What Courage melts not at the sight of Beauty  Oh  Rosalind  how glorious are thy Chains  How much superior to the Crowns of others  Arm  As next of Kindred to the  Alban  Throne  Whilst none but elder Rivals had declar'd  I had some distant Hopes of being heard  Emm  If I have Credit with the King you shall  We are my Brother's Captives not the  Britons  But oh what Hope hast thou to gain her Heart  Where is the Hero that dares rival  Lucius  At the young Warrior's Sight each Virgin Breast  Throbs with an Extacy unutterable  Scarce  Venus  feels more Transport in her Grove  When kindling Wishes hurry on to Love  Arm  I own the Danger of superior Charms  I own his Power and Valour Youth and Form  Are Rivals dreadful to my boldest Hopes  And yet in Counsel with my kinder Stars  Cunning and Conduct may outwit the Hero  And aid my feeble Hand to reach his Heart  Emm  Thou strik'st not there  Arminius  I oppose  And like his better Genius guard the Warrior  Know I have seen him with indulgent Eyes  As thou for  Rosalind  I sigh for him  Arm  Be he immortal then as are your Charms  Within that beauteous Empire ever safe  Emm  Thou hast resolv'd his Fate I read thy Soul  This ten long Months I've study'd thy dark Breast  And know the Want of Vertue in thy Frame  Which must subject thee to the Mind that knows thee  Wherefore I left my Modesty awhile  Reveal'd my virgin Love to guard its Object  Honorius  comes with him the  British  King  Protect my  Lucius  from his Father's Rage  Or by our Nation's Gods thy Queen shall know  'Twas thy illfated Arm which slew  Otharius  Arm  Why with Reproaches does your Highness load me  For what to you alone I have disclos'd  Is this the End of all your promis'd Favour  That promis'd Favour which upheld my Hopes  Yet wherefore should I shrink at your reproach  In Battle bravely did I take his Life  That bar to  Rosalinda's  Throne and Bed  Emm  Spare but young  Lucius  and your Secret's safe  Nay all that I can do to gain the Queen  Arm  Well does the King your Brother love his Sister  Honorius  rules the Fate of  Rosalinda  Direct her to my Arms and  Vortimer  Whose Ear I've gain'd by flatt'ring of his Love  Shall give the Prince to yours  Emm  Oh  Albany  that soars above my Hopes  My haughty Soul would not reveal its Weakness  Yet something must be done I'll think again  But thou my careful Genius guard me well  And thou my Modesty be faithful to me  Heave not my Bosom when the Invader's nigh  Throb not fond Heart to beat to him thy Secret  My Eyes take heed how ye my Pain express  Strike not one Spark that may the Flame confess  He can't despise who does not know our Store  'Tis proffer'd Love makes all our Beauties poor  Exit Emm  Arm  Ha is it so Princess I was to blame  To think a Woman's Friendship void of Int'rest  Th' Advances which she made are now explain'd  She watch'd Prince  Lucius  with a jealous Eye  And taught ev'n me first to suspect his Passion  Be cautious of thy Fate I fear her Cunning  Guard thee my Heart be wary of her search  Else shalt thou never steer amidst these Dangers  Enter  Sylvius  Oh Sister I have News The Prince of  Britain  Adores the widow'd Queen of  Aquitain  Did thy soft Sex and Royal Blood descend  To wear the humble Habit of a Page  To watch each lucky Minute of the Fates  And let another blast thy Brother's Hopes  Syl  I love my Brother with a Sister's Love  As much as e'er a Sister lov'd a Brother  But when compar'd to what I feel for  Lucius  How weak how lambent is the kindred Flame  Then not for thee but him I left my Sex  Left the gay Pleasures of the  British  Court  Thus in a servile Garb to follow  Lucius  To hear his Voice and view his lovely Person  For with the Dawn I took his Beauties in  The vital Air the Sighs which first I breath'd  Were all inform'd were all inspir'd by  Lucius  Arm  Shall  Rosalinda  then possess thy Lover  Syl  Not till  Alenia  dies  Arm  Earth Hell and all aerial Daemons join  Join they with us to blast his hated Passion  Born on the Wings o'th' Wind the Wizard  Alm'rin  Mighty in Spells in Charms and Magick Lore  From  Norway  came to aid our hapless Loves  Ten sleepless Nights in Magick Rites have past  And thus this Morn he has our Doom pronounc'd  "Divide the Lueen and  Lucius  ye are blest  "And in his Arms  Alenia's  Grief shall rest  "For  Rosalinda  thou shalt sigh no more  "If thou with her canst touch thy native Shore  "But oh be swift their stronger Stars may join  "Employ Force Fraud This Day and Night are thine  Syl  The Fates are kind their Oracle is good  Arm  If Scruples weak and vain sway not thy Mind  Alenia  we may yet be blest Oh say  Wilt thou unerring with thy Brother join  In mutual Aid to gain our mutual Loves  Syl  Implicitly I will  Arm  Give me thy Vow  Syl  I swear to act in Concert with my Brother  Arm  Hold'st thou thy Favour with the Queen  Syl  I do She calls me faithful Boy the only one  Of all her vast Retinue she can trust  Embolden'd by this Grace I told the Queen  There was a Prince who always mourn'd her Fate  In Words so tender with a Voice so sweet  I lov'd yet griev'd to hear the moving Story  She ask'd me all transported Is it  Lucius  I sigh'd and paus'd not daring then to name you  Arm  Back dearest Maid and watch their every Glance  Bring me if possible their very Thoughts  That all transparent I may view their Souls  Exit Sylvia  Her Heart for  Lucius  touch'd the Idol bleeds  Tho' tis not fit this Girl shou'd know my Purpose  Arise Invention aid my lab'ring Soul  Fair are all Ways which carry to the Goal  So fir'd by  Venus  Son the Thund'rer  Jove  Of right regardless rushes on his Love  By Fraud or Force he gains the Beauteous Prize  Tasting in various Forms as various Joys  Now as  Alcmena's  Lord their Bed he stains  Then  Spartan Laeda  like a Swan he gains  Europa  by a lovely Bull's betray'd  And in a golden Show'r th' imprison'd Maid  A Dragon curls in bright  Olympia's  Arms  Nor can chaste Vows protect  Calisto's  Charms  Hence Men by Fraud and Artifice succeed  And  Jove's  Example justifies the Deed  Exeunt omnes  End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  The  Queen  and  Irene  Irene  WHY does my charming Mistress thus devote  Her Beauty's Bloom to Sorrow Sighs and Tears  Que  My Husband slain my Country made a Prey  My Guards my Jaylors ev'ry Room a Prison  No faithful Servant left but Thee and  Sylvius  The rest are Spies devoted to the Victors  Ire  And yet those Victors come to break your Chains  Que  Alas they come indeed but 'tis in Triumph  Honorius  call'd the Good has well reveng'd  Th' unjust Attempt which King  Otharius  made  T'enlarge his Empire at his Brother's Cost  Compell'd to wed that most ambitious Prince  I never knew one peaceful Hour in Marriage  Honorius  by his Death the  Romans  vanquish'd  Becomes the first sole Monarch of the  Gauls  A Widow I without a Dow'r or Name  No more the Queen of  Albany  or  Aquitain  Enter  Sylvius  Syl  The Prince of  Britain  to attend your Majesty  Que  Against my self my rebel Passions arm  They bound within my Breast to meet this Victor  Were not my Mind enslav'd were that but free  How could I brave my Chains how calm look down  On those lost Glories which adorn a Crown  Enter  Lucius  He kneels  Why does the conqu'ring Prince of  Britain  kneel  To me no more a Queen a wretched Captive  What wou'd my Lord for I am all Confusion  Luc  I beg a parting Audience and alone  Que  You  Sylvius  and  Irene  both withdraw  Syl  I'll bring the Prince of  Albany  to part ye  Aside  Ex with  Irene  Que  Oh my HeartSure Sir I heard you not aright  Where next does the victorious  Lucius  shine  And which the Kingdom mark'd for Desolation  Luc  I wou'd but oh it dies upon my Tongue  To my lov'd Queen I wou'd discourse of Parting  I wou'd discourse of Night and horrid Gloom  Of dismal Groans and the deep Vault of Death  And when the bitter Cup of Woe is full  I'll summ it all in One and call it Parting  Qu  Beat gently HeartWho sends you hence my Lord  Luc  That awful Virtue which destroys my Hopes  That chilling Coldness which repels my Flame  Henceforth the Joys of Life shall charm no more  No more the dusty Field shall give delight  Triumphant Laurels or the Praise of Beauty  These Robes I'll change to some poor Hermit's Weed  And Herbs and Roots shall be my only Food  My daily Thirst quench'd by some common Stream  No Beam of Light to chear my dismal Cell  But all be dark and joyless as my Fortune  Qu  Why chuse you these Extremes my Lord  Luc  A Convert to that Being which you worship  And which I with my pious Queen adore  I am Christian Follower of your Virtue  At your Command I've heard those holy Men  By that good Prelate  Eleutherius  sent  I've heard their Potent and Coelestial Reasons  Enlighten'd from above my glowing Breast  Bids me undaunted own the sacred Faith  Which when prosess'd I'll take my leave for ever  Of the too cruel  Alban  Queen for ever  Que  What part my Lord when this exalted Change  For which I bow to the informing Pow'rs  Calls you the first of Christian Kings to shine  O'er all the Western World like a bright Star  To bless your People with eternal Knowledge  Luc  For you I quit the Hope of making Converts  For you resign the foremost Rank in Fame  For you I leave the Glories of a Crown  I can no more support this wretched Being  To see such Charms shine forth but not on me  Oh think how absolute my Rival is  Can I from a stern Father's Force preserve you  Unless you will descend to fix my Claim  And let me call you mine e're he arrive  Que  How shall I teach my Tongue against my Heart  Aside  Luc  Am I not worth a Word the least Regard  How many anxious Days and sleepless Nights  Have I devoted to afflicted Beauty  But she regardless pities not my Pain  Or she ungrateful triumphs in my Ruin  Tho' I for her first felt the Sting of Passion  First felt the Force of Charms what strong Desires  And eager Longings are inspir'd by Beauty  Qu  My suff'ring Heart by Sorrow quite possess'd  Can make no Room for any other Thought  Luc  Oh blest  Otharius  happier in thy Death  More happy than the living hated  Lucius  Therefore my Heart be this thy last Effort  Part part and dieFrom those dear Eyes remove  This wretched Object of despairing Love  Qu  We cannot must not part Ye mighty Pow'rs  Tear not this only Good from my poor Heart  Take all besides leave me but him alone  And I no more will think of Crowns and Empires  Luc  Oh full Reward of all my former Pain  Oppress'd I saint

force of Love  'Tis fought and thou hast gain'd the Victory  The Struggles past tho' vanquish'd yet grown bold  I mustI do declareI cannot speak it  Leave me to blush alone for this Confession  Luc  Not 'till the holy Priest has join'd our Hands  Oh my fair Queenthis Night must see me blest  Queen  To Morrow gentle  Lucius  Luc  Let those who set no Value on the Present  With easy Idleness expect to Morrow  Suppose the King grown furious to possess  Shou'd force you to his Bed shou'd force his Joys  As once he did my Royal suff'ring Mother  A Captive you oh how may you resist  Think but of  Lucius  then and his despair  O think my Queen what I wou'd then exchange  For but a Moment of that precious Time  You will not now employ  The conqu'ring Monarch's come I hear their Trumpets  Oh sound sound on it is for  Lucius  Triumph  Yield yield my Fair and all my Fears remove  Quick to thy inmost Chamber fly my Love  Where binding Vows my lasting Truth shall prove  Queen  But if the cruel King command my Death Swear  Lucius  at the Peril of thy Life To guard thy  Rosalinda's  Luc  I swear my Queen by Glory and by Love  I will protect thee tho' against my Father  But now my Fair

Such Vows that  Lucius  ne'er had spoke of Love  That scarce was it a Merit to believe her  Thus was my easy Faith abus'd  Luc  What Proof hast thou of this  Arm  Oh I had ev'ry Proof Her Virgin Heart  Her speaking Eyes her Lips her charming Tongue  And the pale Queen of Night on flow'ry Banks  Whilst we invok'd her Beams beheld our Loves  Each happy Moment witness'd to our Joys  True Emblems of

Lovers shed  By all the Sweets of  Rosalinda  's Arms  Have pity on my Royal Birth and Suff'rings  Confess what I alas too much suspect  Confess you do succeed me in her Favour  That I may wander to
