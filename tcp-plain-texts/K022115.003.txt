ADVERTISEMENT  _I THINK it proper to inform the public that tho' this be a third volume of the  Treatise of Human Nature  yet 'tis in some measure independent of the other two and requires not that the reader shou'd enter into all the abstract reasonings contain'd in them I am hopeful it may be understood by ordinary readers with as little attention as is usually given to any books of reasoning It must only be observ'd that I continue to make use of the terms  impressions  and  ideas  in the same sense as formerly and that by  impressions I mean our stronger perceptions such as our sensations affections and sentiments and by ideas the fainter perceptions or the copies of these in the memory and imagination  THE CONTENTS  BOOK III  Of  MORALS  PART I  Of virtue and vice in

Reason  _THERE is an inconvenience which attends all abstruse reasoning that it may silence without convincing an antagonist and requires the same intense study to  make us sensible of its force that was at first requisite for its invention When we leave our closet and engage in the common affairs of life its conclusions seem to vanish like the phantoms of the night on the appearance of the morning and 'tis difficult for us to retain even that conviction which we had attain'd with difficulty This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of reasoning where we must preserve to the end the evidence of the first propositions and where we often lose sight of all the most receiv'd maxims either of philosophy or common life I am not however without hopes that the present system of philosophy will acquire new force as it advances and that our reasonings concerning  morals  will corroborate whatever has been said concerning the  understanding  and the  passions  Morality is a subject that interests us above all others We fancy the peace of society to be at stake in every decision concerning it and 'tis evident that this concern must make our speculations appear more real and solid than where the subject is in a great measure indifferent to us What affects us we conclude can never be a chimera and as our passion is engag'd on the one side or the other we naturally think  that the question lies within human comprehension which in other cases of this nature we are apt to entertain some doubt of Without this advantage I never should have ventur'd upon a third volume of such abstruse philosophy in an age wherein the greatest part of men seem agreed to convert reading into an amusement and to reject every thing that requires any considerable degree of attention to be comprehended  IT has been observ'd that nothing is ever present to the mind but its perceptions and that all the actions of seeing hearing judging loving hating and thinking fall under this denomination The mind can never exert itself in any action which we may not comprehend under the term of  perception  and consequently that term is no less applicable to those judgments by which we distinguish moral good and evil than to every other operation of the mind To approve of one character to condemn another are only so many different perceptions  NOW as perceptions resolve themselves into two kinds viz  impressions  and  ideas  this distinction gives rise to a question with which we shall open up our present enquiry concerning morals  Whether 'tis by means of  our  ideas  or  impressions  we distinguish betwixt vice and virtue and pronounce an action blameable or praiseworthy  This will immediately cut off all loose discourses and declamations and reduce us to something precise and exact on the present subject  THOSE who affirm that virtue is nothing but a conformity to reason that there are eternal fitnesses and unfitnesses of things which are the same to every rational being that considers them that the immutable measures of right and wrong impose an obligation not only on human creatures but also on the Deity himself All these systems concur in the opinion that morality like truth is discern'd merely by ideas and by their juxtaposition and comparison In order therefore to judge of these systems we need only consider whether it be possible from reason alone to distinguish betwixt moral good and evil or whether there must concur some other principles to enable us to make that distinction  IF morality had naturally no influence on human passions and actions 'twere in vain to take such pains to inculcate it and nothing wou'd be more fruitless than that multitude of rules and precepts with which all moralists abound Philosophy is commonly  divided into  speculative  and  practical  and as morality is always comprehended under the latter division 'tis supposed to influence our passions and actions and to go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the understanding And this is confirm'd by common experience which informs us that men are often govern'd by their duties and are deter'd from some actions by the opinion of injustice and impell'd to others by that of obligation  SINCE morals therefore have an influence on the actions and affections it follows that they cannot be deriv'd from reason and that because reason alone as we have already prov'd can never have any such influence Morals excite passions and produce or prevent actions Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular The rules of morality therefore are not conclusions of our reason  NO one I believe will deny the justness of this inference nor is there any other means of evading it than by denying that principle on which it is founded As long as it is allow'd that reason has no influence on our passions and actions 'tis in vain to pretend that morality is discover'd only by a deduction of reason An active principle  can never be founded on an inactive and if reason be inactive in itself it must remain so in all its shapes and appearances whether it exerts itself in natural or moral subjects whether it considers the powers of external bodies or the actions of rational beings  IT would be tedious to repeat all the arguments by which I have prov'd  Book II Part III Sect  that reason is perfectly inert and can never either prevent or produce any action or affection 'Twill be easy to recollect what has been said upon that subject I shall only recal on this occasion one of these arguments which I shall endeavour to render still more conclusive and more applicable to the present subject  REASON is the discovery of truth or falshood Truth or falshood consists in an agreement or disagreement either to the  real  relations of ideas or to  real  existence and matter of fact Whatever therefore is not susceptible of this argeement or disagreement is incapable of being true or false and can never be an object of our reason Now 'tis evident our passions volitions and actions are not susceptible of any such agreement or disagreement being original facts and realities compleat in themselves and implying  no reference to other passions volitions and actions 'Tis impossible therefore they can be pronounced either true or false and be either contrary or conformable to reason  THIS argument is of double advantage to our present purpose For it proves  directly  that actions do not derive their merit from a conformity to reason nor their blame from a contrariety to it and it proves the same truth more  indirectly  by shewing us that as reason can never immediately prevent or produce any action by contradicting or approving of it it cannot be the source of moral good and evil which are found to have that influence Actions may be laudable or blameable but they cannot be reasonable or unreasonable Laudable or blameable therefore are not the same with reasonable or unreasonable The merit and demerit of actions frequently contradict and sometimes controul our natural propensities But reason has no such influence Moral distinctions therefore are not the offspring of reason Reason is wholly inactive and can never be the source of so active a principle as conscience or a sense of morals  BUT perhaps it may be said that tho' no will or action can be immediately contradictory to reason yet we may find such a  contradiction in some of the attendants of the action that is in its causes or effects The action may cause a judgment or may be  obliquely  caus'd by one when the judgment concurs with a passion and by an abusive way of speaking which philosophy will scarce allow of the same contrariety may upon that account be ascrib'd to the action How far this truth or falshood may be the source of morals 'twill now be proper to consider  IT has been observ'd that reason in a strict and philosophical sense can have an influence on our conduct only after two ways Either when it excites a passion by informing us of the existence of something which is a proper object of it or when it discovers the connexion of causes and effects so as to afford us means of exerting any passion These are the only kinds of judgment which can accompany our actions or can be said to produce them in any manner and it must be allow'd that these judgments may often be false and erroneous A person may be affected with passion by supposing a pain or pleasure to lie in an object which has no tendency to produce either of these sensations or which produces the contrary to what is imagin'd A person may also  take false measures for the attaining his end and may retard by his foolish conduct instead of forwarding the execution of any project These false judgments may be thought to affect the passions and actions which are connected with them and may be said to render them unreasonable in a figurative and improper way of speaking But tho' this be acknowledg'd 'tis easy to observe that these errors are so far from being the source of all immorality that they are commonly very innocent and draw no manner of guilt upon the person who is so unfortunate as to fall into them They extend not beyond a mistake of  fact  which moralists have not generally suppos'd criminal as being perfectly involuntary I am more to be lamented than blam'd if I am mistaken with regard to the influence of objects in producing pain or pleasure or if I know not the proper means of satisfying my desires No one can ever regard such errors as a defect in my moral character A fruit for instance that is really disagreeable appears to me at a distance and thro' mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious Here is one error I choose certain means of reaching this fruit which are not proper for my end Here is a second error nor is there  any third one which can ever possibly enter into our reasonings concerning actions I ask therefore if a man in this situation and guilty of these two errors is to be regarded as vicious and criminal however unavoidable they might have been Or if it be possible to imagine that such errors are the sources of all immorality  AND here it may be proper to observe that if moral distinctions be deriv'd from the truth or falshood of those judgments they must take place wherever we form the judgments nor will there be any difference whether the question be concerning an apple or a kingdom or whether the error be avoidable or unavoidable For as the very essence of morality is suppos'd to consist in an agreement or disagreement to reason the other circumstances are entirely arbitrary and can never either bestow on any action the character of virtuous or vicious or deprive it of that character To which we may add that this agreement or disagreement not admitting of degrees all virtues and vices wou'd of course be equal  SHOU'D it be pretended that tho' a mistake of  fact  be not criminal yet a mistake of  right  often is and that this may be the source of immorality I would answer that  'tis impossible such a mistake can ever be the original source of immorality since it supposes a real right and wrong that is a real distinction in morals independent of these judgments A mistake therefore of right may become a species of immorality but 'tis only a secondary one and is founded on some other antecedent to it  AS to those judgments which are the  effects  of our actions and which when false give occasion to pronounce the actions contrary to truth and reason we may observe that our actions never cause any judgment either true or false in ourselves and that 'tis only on others they have such an influence 'Tis certain that an action on many occasions may give rise to false conclusions in others and that a person who thro' a window sees any lewd behaviour of mine with my neighbour's wife may be so simple as to imagine she is certainly my own In this respect my action resembles somewhat a lye or falshood only with this difference which is material that I perform not the action with any intention of giving rise to a false judgment in another but merely to satisfy my lust and passion It causes however a mistake and false judgment by accident and the falshood of its effects may be ascribed  by some odd figurative way of speaking to the action itself But still I can see no pretext of reason for asserting that the tendency to cause such an error is the first spring or original source of all immorality  One might think it were entirely superfluous to prove this if a late author who has had the good fortune to obtain some reputation had not seriously affirmed that such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity That we may discover the fallacy of his hypothesis we need only consider that a false conclusion is drawn from an action only by means of an obscurity of natural principles which makes a cause be secretly interrupted in its operation by contrary causes and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable Now as a like uncertainty and variety of causes take place even in natural objects and produce a like error in our judgment if that tendency to produce error were the very essence of vice and immorality it shou'd follow that even inanimate objects might be vicious and immoral  'Tis in vain to urge that inanimate objects act without liberty and choice For as liberty and choice are not necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclusion they can be in no respect essential to morality and I do not readily perceive upon this system how they can ever come to be regarded by it If the tendency to cause error be the origin of immorality that tendency and immorality wou'd in every case be inseparable  Add to this that if I had used the precaution of shutting the windows while I indulg'd myself in those liberties with my neighbour's wife I should have been guilty of no immorality and that because my action being perfectly conceal'd wou'd have had no tendency to produce any false conclusion  For the same reason a thief who steals in by a ladder at a window and takes all imaginable care to cause no disturbance is in no respect criminal For either he will not be perceiv'd or if he be 'tis impossible he can produce any error nor will any one from these circumstances take him to be other than what he really is  'Tis well known that those who are squintsighted do very readily cause mistakes in others and that we imagine they salute or are talking to one person while they address themselves to another Are they therefore upon that account immoral  Besides we may easily observe that in all those arguments there is an evident reasoning in a circle A person who takes possession of  another  's goods and uses them as his  own  in a manner declares them to be his own and this falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice But is property or right or obligation intelligible without an antecedent morality  A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor in a manner affirms that he never received any favours from him But in what manner Is it because 'tis his duty to be grateful But this supposes that there is some antecedent rule of duty and morals Is it because human nature is generally grateful and makes us conclude that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harm'd But human nature is not so generally grateful as to justify such a conclusion Or if it were is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal for no other reason than because it is an exception  But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical system is that it leaves us under the same difficulty to give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious as to account for the merit or turpitude of any other action I shall allow if you please that all immorality is derived from this supposed falsehood in action provided you can give me any plausible reason why such a falshood is immoral If you consider rightly of the matter you will find yourself in the same difficulty as at the beginning  This last argument is very conclusive because if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex'd to this species of truth or falshood it can never have any influence upon our actions For who ever thought of forbearing any action because others might possibly draw false conclusions from it Or who ever perform'd any that he might give rise to true conclusions    THUS upon the whole 'tis impossible that the distinction betwixt moral good and evil  can be made by reason since that distinction has an influence upon our actions of which reason alone is incapable Reason and judgment may indeed be the mediate cause of an action by prompting or by directing a  passion But it is not pretended that a judgment of this kind either in its truth or falshood is attended with virtue or vice And as to the judgments which are caused by our judgments they can still less bestow those moral qualities on the actions which are their causes  BUT to be more particular and to shew that those eternal immutable fitnesses and unfitnesses of things cannot be defended by sound philosophy we may weigh the following considerations  IF the thought and understanding were alone capable of fixing the boundaries of right and wrong the character of virtuous and vicious either must lie in some relations of objects or must be a matter of fact which is discovered by our reasoning This consequence is evident As the operations of human understanding divide themselves into two kinds the comparing of ideas and the inferring of matter of fact were virtue discover'd by the understanding it must be an object of one of these operations nor is there any third operation of the understanding which can discover it There has been an opinion very industriously propagated by certain philosophers that morality is susceptible of demonstration and tho' no one has  ever been able to advance a single step in those demonstrations yet 'tis taken for granted that this science may be brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra Upon this supposition vice and virtue must consist in some relations since 'tis allow'd on all hands that no matter of fact is capable of being demonstrated Let us therefore begin with examining this hypothesis and endeavour if possible to fix those moral qualities which have been so long the objects of our fruitless researches Point out distinctly the relations which constitute morality or obligation that we may know wherein they consist and after what manner we must judge of them  IF you assert that vice and virtue consist in relations susceptible of certainty and demonstration you must confine yourself to those  four  relations which alone admit of that degree of evidence and in that case you run into absurdities from which you will never be able to extricate yourself For as you make the very essence of morality to lie in the relations and as there is no one of these relations but what is applicable not only to an irrational but also to an inanimate object it follows that even such objects must be susceptible of merit or demerit  Resemblance contrariety degrees in quality  and  proportions in quantity and number  all these relations belong as properly to matter as to our actions passions and volitions 'Tis unquestionable therefore that morality lies not in any of these relations nor the sense of it in their discovery  As a proof how confus'd our way of thinking on this subject commonly is we may observe that those who assert that morality is demonstrable do not say that morality lies in the relations and that the relations are distinguishable by reason They only say that reason can discover such an action in such relations to be virtuous and such another vicious It seems they thought it sufficient if they cou'd bring the word Relation into the proposition without troubling themselves whether it was to the purpose or not But here I think is plain argument Demonstrative reason discovers only relations But that reason according to this hypothesis discovers also vice and virtue These moral qualities therefore must be relations When we blame any action in any situation the whole complicated object of action and situation must form certain relations wherein the essence of vice consists This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible For what does reason discover when it pronounces any action vicious Does it discover a relation or a matter of fact These questions are decisive and must not be eluded    SHOU'D it be asserted that the sense of morality consists in the discovery of some relation distinct from these and that our enumeration was not compleat when we comprehended all demonstrable relations under four general heads To this I know not what to reply till some one be so good as to point out to me this new relation 'Tis impossible to refute a system which has never  yet been explain'd In such a manner of fighting in the dark a man loses his blows in the air and often places them where the enemy is not present  I MUST therefore on this occasion rest contented with requiring the two following conditions of any one that wou'd undertake to clear up this system  First  As moral good and evil belong only to the actions of the mind and are deriv'd from our situation with regard to external objects the relations from which these moral distinctions arise must lie only betwixt internal actions and external objects and must not be applicable either to internal actions compared among themselves or to external objects when placed in opposition to other external objects For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations if these relations cou'd belong to internal actions consider'd singly it wou'd follow that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves and independent of our situation with respect to the universe And in like manner if these moral relations cou'd be apply'd to external objects it wou'd follow that even inanimate beings wou'd be susceptible of moral beauty and deformity Now it seems difficult to imagine that any relation can be discover'd betwixt our passions  volitions and actions compared to external objects which relation might not belong either to these passions and volitions or to these external objects compar'd among  themselves  BUT it will be still more difficult to fulfil the  second  condition requisite to justify this system According to the principles of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral good and evil and a natural fitness and unfitness of things 'tis not only suppos'd that these relations being eternal and immutable are the same when consider'd by every rational creature but their  effects  are also suppos'd to be necessarily the same and 'tis concluded they have no less or rather a greater influence in directing the will of the deity than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own species These two particulars are evidently distinct 'Tis one thing to know virtue and another to conform the will to it In order therefore to prove that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws  obligatory  on every rational mind 'tis not sufficient to shew the relations upon which they are founded We must also point out the connexion betwixt the relation and the will and must prove that this connexion is so  necessary that in every welldisposed mind it must take place and have its influence tho' the difference betwixt these minds be in other respects immense and infinite Now besides what I have already prov'd that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any action besides this I say it has been shewn in treating of the understanding that there is no connexion of cause and effect such as this is suppos'd to be which is discoverable otherwise than by experience and of which we can pretend to have any security by the simple consideration of the objects All beings in the universe consider'd in themselves appear entirely loose and independent of each other 'Tis only by experience we learn their influence and connexion and this influence we ought never to extend beyond experience  THUS it will be impossible to fulfil the  first  condition required to the system of eternal rational measures of right and wrong because it is impossible to shew those relations upon which such a distinction may be founded And 'tis as impossible to fulfil the  second  condition because we cannot prove  a priori  that these relations if they really existed and were perceiv'd wou'd be universally forcible and obligatory  BUT to make these general reflections more clear and convincing we may illustrate them by some particular instances wherein this character of moral good or evil is the most universally acknowledged Of all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing the most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude especially when it is committed against parents and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death This is acknowledg'd by all mankind philosophers as well as the people the question only arises among philosophers whether the guilt or moral deformity of this action be discover'd by demonstrative reasoning or be felt by an internal sense and by means of some sentiment which the reflecting on such an action naturally occasions This question will soon be decided against the former opinion if we can shew the same relations in other objects without the notion of any guilt or iniquity attending them Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas and the discovery of their relations and if the same relations have different characters it must evidently follow that those characters are not discover'd merely by reason To put the affair therefore to this trial let us chuse any inanimate object  such as an oak or elm and let us suppose that by the dropping of its seed it produces a sapling below it which springing up by degrees at last overtops and destroys the parent tree I ask if in this instance there be wanting any relation which is discoverable in parricide or ingratitude Is not the one tree the cause of the other's existence and the latter the cause of the destruction of the former in the same manner as when a child murders his parent 'Tis not sufficient to reply that a choice or will is wanting For in the case of parricide a will does not give rise to any  different  relations but is only the cause from which the action is deriv'd and consequently produces the  same  relations that in the oak or elm arise from some other principles 'Tis a will or choice that determines a man to kill his parent and they are the laws of matter and motion that determine a sapling to destroy the oak from which it sprung Here then the same relations have different causes but still the relations are the same And as th  discovery is not in both cases attended with a notion of immorality it follows that that notion does not arise from  uch a discovery  BUT to chuse an instance still more resembling I would fain ask any one why incest in the human species is criminal and why the very same action and the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral turpitude and deformity If it be answer'd that this action is innocent in animals because they have not reason sufficient to discover its turpitude but that man being endow'd with that faculty which  ought  to restrain him to his duty the same action instantly becomes criminal to him should this be said I would reply that this is evidently arguing in a circle For before reason can perceive this turpitude the turpitude must exist and consequently is independent of the decisions of our reason and is their object more properly than their effect According to this system then every animal that has sense and appetite and will that is every animal must be susceptible of all the same virtues and vices for which we ascribe praise and blame to human creatures  the difference is that our superior reason may serve to discover the vice or virtue and by that means may augment the blame or praise But still this discovery supposes a separate being in these moral distinctions and a being which depends only on the  will and appetite and which both in thought and reality may be distinguish'd from the reason Animals are susceptible of the same relations with respect to each other as the human species and therefore wou'd also be susceptible of the same morality if the essence of morality consisted in these relations Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality but can never hinder these duties from existing since they must antecedently exist in order to their being perceiv'd Reason must find them and can never produce them This argument deserves to be weigh'd as being in my opinion entirely decisive  NOR does this reasoning only prove that morality consists not in any relations that are the objects of science but if examin'd will prove with equal certainty that it consists not in any  matter of fact  which can be discover'd by the understanding This is the  second  part of our argument and if it can be made evident we may conclude that morality is not an object of reason But can there be any difficulty in proving that vice and virtue are not matters of fact whose existence we can infer by reason Take any action allow'd to be vicious Wilful  murder for instance Examine it in all lights and see if you can find that matter of fact or real existence which you call  vice  In whichever way you take it you find only certain passions motives volitions and thoughts There is no other matter of fact in the case The vice entirely escapes you as long as you consider the object You never can find it till you turn your reflection into your own breast and find a sentiment of disapprobation which arises in you towards this action Here is a matter of fact but 'tis the object of feeling not of reason It lies in yourself not in the object So that when you pronounce any action or character to be vicious you mean nothing but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it Vice and virtue therefore may be compar'd to sounds colours heat and cold which according to modern philosophy are not qualities in objects but perceptions in the mind And this discovery in morals like that other in physics is to be regarded as a considerable advancement of the speculative sciences tho' like that too it has little or no influence on practice Nothing can be more real or concern us more than our  own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness and if these be favourable to virtue and unfavourable to vice no more can be requisite to the regulation of our conduct and behaviour  I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation which may perhaps be found of some importance In every system of morality which I have hitherto met with I have always remark'd that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning and establishes the being of a God or makes observations concerning human affairs when of a sudden I am surpriz'd to find that instead of the usual copulations of propositions  is  and  is not  I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an  ought  or an  ought not  This change is imperceptible but is however of the last consequence For as this  ought  or  ought not  expresses some new relation or affirmation 'tis necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd and at the same time that a reason should be given for what seems altogether inconceivable how this new relation can be a deduction from others which are entirely different from it But as authors do not commonly use this precaution I shall presume to recommend it to the readers  and am persuaded that this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar systems of morality and let us see that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects nor is perceiv'd by reason  SECT II  Moral distinctions deriv'd from a moral sense  THUS the course of the argument leads us to conclude that since vice and virtue are not discoverable merely by reason or the comparison of ideas it must be by means of some impression or sentiment they occasion that we are able to mark the difference betwixt them Our decisions concerning moral rectitude and depravity are evidently perceptions and as all perceptions are either impressions or ideas the exclusion of the one is a convincing argument for the other Morality therefore is more properly felt than judg'd of tho' this feeling or sentiment is commonly so soft and gentle that we are apt to confound it with an idea according to our common  custom of taking all things for the same which have any near resemblance to each other  THE next question is Of what nature are these impressions and after what manner do they operate upon us Here we cannot remain long in suspense but must pronounce the impression arising from virtue to be agreeable and that proceding from vice to be uneasy Every moment's experience must convince us of this There is no spectacle so fair and beautiful as a noble and generous action nor any which gives us more abhorrence than one that is cruel and treacherous No enjoyment equals the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and esteem as the greatest of all punishments is to be oblig'd to pass our lives with those we hate or contemn A very play or romance may afford us instances of this pleasure which virtue conveys to us and pain which arises from vice  NOW since the distinguishing impressions by which moral good or evil is known are nothing but  particular  pains or pleasures it follows that in all enquiries concerning these moral distinctions it will be sufficient to shew the principles which make us feel a satisfaction or uneasiness from the survey of any  character in order to satisfy us why the character is laudable or blameable An action or sentiment or character is virtuous or vicious why because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind In giving a reason therefore for the pleasure or uneasiness we sufficiently explain the vice or virtue To have the sense of virtue is nothing but to  feel  a satisfaction of a particular kind from the contemplation of a character The very  feeling  constitutes our praise or admiration We go no farther nor do we enquire into the cause of the satisfaction We do not infer a character to be virtuous because it pleases But in feeling that it pleases after such a particular manner we in effect feel that it is virtuous The case is the same as in our judgments concerning all kinds of beauty and tastes and sensations Our approbation is imply'd in the immediate pleasure they convey to us  I HAVE objected to the system which establishes eternal rational measures of right and wrong that 'tis impossible to shew in the actions of reasonable creatures any relations which are not found in external objects and therefore if morality always attended these relations 'twere possible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or vicious  Now it may in like manner be objected to the present system that if virtue and vice be determin'd by pleasure and pain these qualities must in every case arise from the sensations and consequently any object whether animate or inanimate rational or irrational might become morally good or evil provided it can excite a satisfaction or uneasiness But tho' this objection seems to be the very same it has by no means the same force in the one case as in the other For  first  'tis evident that under the term  pleasure  we comprehend sensations which are very different from each other and which have only such a distant resemblance as is requisite to make them be express'd by the same abstract term A good composition of music and a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure and what is more their goodness is determin'd merely by the pleasure But shall we say upon that account that the wine is harmonious or the music of a good flavour In like manner an inanimate object and the character or sentiments of any person may both of them give satisfaction but as the satisfaction is different this keeps our sentiments concerning them from being confounded and makes us ascribe virtue to the one and not to the other  Nor is every sentiment of pleasure or pain which arises from characters and actions of that  peculiar  kind which makes us praise or condemn The good qualities of an enemy are hurtful to us but may still command our esteem and respect 'Tis only when a character is considered in general without reference to our particular interest that it causes such a feeling or sentiment as denominates it morally good or evil 'Tis true those sentiments from interest and morals are apt to be confounded and naturally run into one another It seldom happens that we do not think an enemy vicious and can distinguish betwixt his opposition to our interest and real villainy or baseness But this hinders not but that the sentiments are in themselves distinct and a man of temper and judgment may preserve himself from these illusions In like manner tho' 'tis certain a musical voice is nothing but one that naturally gives a  particular  kind of pleasure yet 'tis difficult for a man to be sensible that the voice of an enemy is agreeable or to allow it to be musical But a person of a fine ear who has the command of himself can separate these feelings and give praise to what deserves it  Secondly  We may call to remembrance the preceding system of the passions in order to remark a still more considerable difference among our pains and pleasures Pride and humility love and hatred are excited when there is any thing presented to us that both bears a relation to the object of the passion and produces a separate sensation related to the sensation of the passion Now virtue and vice are attended with these circumstances They must necessarily be plac'd either in ourselves or others and excite either pleasure or uneasiness and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions which clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from inanimate objects that often bear no relation to us And this is perhaps the most considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the human mind  IT may now be ask'd  in general  concerning this pain or pleasure that distinguishes moral good and evil  From what principles is it derived and whence does it arise in the human mind  To this I reply  first  that 'tis absurd to imagine that in every particular instance these sentiments are produc'd by an  original  quality and  primary  constitution For as the number of  our duties is in a manner infinite 'tis impossible that our original instincts should extend to each of them and from our very first infancy impress on the human mind all that multitude of precepts which are contain'd in the compleatest system of ethics Such a method of proceeding is not conformable to the usual maxims by which nature is conducted where a few principles produce all that variety we observe in the universe and every thing is carry'd on in the easiest and most simple manner 'Tis necessary therefore to abridge these primary impulses and find some more general principles upon which all our notions of morals are founded  BUT in the  second  place should it be ask'd Whether we ought to search for these principles in  nature  or whether we must look for them in some other origin I wou'd reply that our answer to this question depends upon the definition of the word Nature than which there is none more ambiguous and equivocal If  nature  be oppos'd to miracles not only the distinction betwixt vice and virtue is natural but also every event which has ever happen'd in the world  excepting those miracles on which our religion is founded  In saying then that the sentiments  of vice and virtue are natural in this sense we make no very extraordinary discovery  BUT  nature  may also be opposed to rare and unusual and in this sense of the word which is the common one there may often arise disputes concerning what is natural or unnatural and one may in general affirm that we are not possess'd of any very precise standard by which these disputes can be decided Frequent and rare depend upon the number of examples we have observ'd and as this number may gradually encrease or diminish 'twill be impossible to fix any exact boundaries betwixt them We may only affirm on this head that if ever there was any thing which cou'd be call'd natural in this sense the sentiments of morality certainly may since there never was any nation of the world nor any single person in any nation who was utterly depriv'd of them and who never in any instance shew'd the least approbation or dislike of manners These sentiments are so rooted in our constitution and temper that without entirely confounding the human mind by disease or madness 'tis impossible to extirpate and destroy them  BUT  nature  may also be opposed to artifice as well as to what is rare and unusual  and in this sense it may be disputed whether the notions of virtue be natural or not We readily forget that the designs and projects and views of men are principles as necessary in their operation as heat and cold moist and dry But taking them to be free and entirely our own 'tis usual for us to set them in opposition to the other principles of nature Shou'd it therefore be demanded whether the sense of virtue be natural or artificial I am of opinion that 'tis impossible for me at present to give any precise answer to this question Perhaps it will appear afterwards that our sense of some virtues is artificial and that of others natural The discussion of this question will be more proper when we enter upon an exact detail of each particular vice and virtue  In the following discourse  natural  is also opposed sometimes to  civil  sometimes to  moral  The opposition will always discover the sense in which it is taken    MEAN while it may not be amiss to observe from these definitions of  natural  and  unnatural  that nothing can be more unphilosophical than those systems which assert that virtue is the same with what is natural and vice with what is unnatural For in the first sense of the word Nature as opposed to miracles both vice and virtue are equally natural and in the second sense as oppos'd to  what is unusual perhaps virtue will be found to be the most unnatural At least it must be own'd that heroic virtue being as unusual is as little natural as the most brutal barbarity As to the third sense of the word 'tis certain that both vice and virtue are equally artificial and out of nature For however it may be disputed whether the notion of a merit or demerit in certain actions be natural or artificial 'tis evident that the actions themselves are artificial and are perform'd with a certain design and intention otherwise they cou'd never be rank'd under any of these denominations 'Tis impossible therefore that the character of natural and unnatural can ever in any sense mark the boundaries of vice and virtue  THUS we are still brought back to our first position that virtue is distinguished by the pleasure and vice by the pain that any action sentiment or character gives us by the mere view and contemplation This decision is very commodious because it reduces us to this simple question  Why any action or sentiment upon the general view or survey gives a certain satisfaction or uneasiness  in order to shew the origin of its moral rectitude or depravity without looking for any incomprehensible relations and qualities  which never did exist in nature nor even in our imagination by any clear and distinct conception I flatter myself I have executed a great part of my present design by a state of the question which appears to me so free from ambiguity and obscurity  PART II  Of justice and injustice  SECT I  Justice whether a natural or artificial virtue  _I HAVE already hinted that our sense of every kind of virtue is not natural but that there are some virtues that produce pleasure and approbation by means of an artifice or contrivance which arises from the circumstances and necessity of mankind Of this kind I assert  justice  to be and shall endeavour to defend this opinion by a short and I hope convincing argument before I examine the nature of the artifice from which the sense of that virtue is derived  'TIS evident that when we praise any actions we regard only the motives that produced them and consider the actions as signs or indications of certain principles in the mind and temper The external performance has no merit We must look within to find the moral quality This we cannot do directly and therefore fix our attention on actions as on external signs But these actions are still considered as signs and the ultimate object of our praise and approbation is the motive that produc'd them  AFTER the same manner when we require any action or blame a person for not performing it we always suppose that one in that situation shou'd be influenc'd by the proper motive of that action and we esteem it vicious in him to be regardless of it If we find upon enquiry that the virtuous motive was still powerful over his breast tho' check'd in its operation by some circumstances unknown to us we retract our blame and have the same esteem for him as if he had actually perform'd the action which we require of him  IT appears therefore that all virtuous actions derive their merit only from virtuous motives and are consider'd merely as signs  of those motives From this principle I conclude that the first virtuous motive which bestows a merit on any action can never be a regard to the virtue of that action but must be some other natural motive or principle To suppose that the mere regard to the virtue of the action may be the first motive which produc'd the action and render'd it virtuous is to reason in a circle Before we can have such a regard the action must be really virtuous and this virtue must be deriv'd from some virtuous motive And consequently the virtuous motive must be different from the regard to the virtue of the action A virtuous motive is requisite to render an action virtuous An action must be virtuous before we can have a regard to its virtue Some virtuous motive therefore must be antecedent to that regard  NOR is this merely a metaphysical subtilty but enters into all our reasonings in common life tho' perhaps we may not be able to place it in such distinct philosophical terms We blame a father for neglecting his child Why because it shews a want of natural affection which is the duty of every parent Were not natural affection a duty the care of children cou'd not be a duty and 'twere impossible we cou'd have the duty  in our eye in the attention we give to our offspring In this case therefore all men suppose a motive to the action distinct from a sense of duty  HERE is a man that does many benevolent actions relieves the distress'd comforts the afflicted and extends his bounty even to the greatest strangers No character can be more amiable and virtuous We regard these actions as proofs of the greatest humanity This humanity bestows a merit on the actions A regard to this merit is therefore a secondary consideration and deriv'd from the antecedent principles of humanity which is meritorious and laudable  IN short it may be establish'd as an undoubted maxim  that no action can be virtuous or morally good unless there be in human nature some motive to produce it distinct from the sense of its morality  BUT may not the sense of morality or duty produce an action without any other motive I answer It may But this is no objection to the present doctrine When any virtuous motive or principle is common in human nature a person who feels his heart devoid of that motive may hate himself upon that account and may perform the action without the motive from a certain  sense of duty in order to acquire by practice that virtuous principle or at least to disguise to himself as much as possible his want of it A man that really feels no gratitude in his temper is still pleas'd to perform grateful actions and thinks he has by that means fulfill'd his duty Actions are at first only consider'd as signs of motives But 'tis usual in this case as in all others to fix our attention on the signs and neglect in some measure the thing signify'd But tho' on some occasions a person may perform an action merely out of regard to its moral obligation yet still this supposes in human nature some distinct principles which are capable of producing the action and whose moral beauty renders the action meritorious  NOW to apply all this to the present case I suppose a person to have lent me a sum of money on condition that it be restor'd in a few days and also suppose that after the expiration of the term agreed on he demands the sum I ask  What reason or motive have I to restore the money  It will perhaps be said that my regard to justice and abhorrence of villainy and knavery are sufficient reasons for me if I have the least grain of honesty or sense of duty and obligation  And this answer no doubt is just and satisfactory to man in his civiliz'd state and when train'd up according to a certain discipline and education But in his rude and more  natural  condition if you are pleas'd to call such a condition natural this answer wou'd be rejected as perfectly unintelligible and sophistical For one in that situation wou'd immediately ask you  Wherein consists this honesty and justice which you find in restoring a loan and abstaining from the property of others  It does not surely lie in the external action It must therefore be plac'd in the motive from which the external action is deriv'd This motive can never be a regard to the honesty of the action For 'tis a plain fallacy to say that a virtuous motive is requisite to render an action honest and at the same time that a regard to the honesty is the motive of the action We can never have a regard to the virtue of an action unless the action be antecedently virtuous No action can be virtuous but so far as it proceeds from a virtuous motive A virtuous motive therefore must precede the regard to the virtue and 'tis impossible that the virtuous motive and the regard to the virtue can be the same  'TIS requisite then to find some motive to acts of justice and honesty distinct from our regard to the honesty and in this lies the great difficulty For shou'd we say that a concern for our private interest or reputation is the legitimate motive to all honest actions it wou'd follow that wherever that concern ceases honesty can no longer have place But 'tis certain that selflove when it acts at its liberty instead of engaging us to honest actions is the source of all injustice and violence nor can a man ever correct those vices without correcting and restraining the  natural  movements of that appetite  BUT shou'd it be affirm'd that the reason or motive of such actions is the  regard to publick interest  to which nothing is more contrary than examples of injustice and dishonesty shou'd this be said I wou'd propose the three following considerations as worthy of our attention  First  public interest is not naturally attach'd to the observation of the rules of justice but is only connected with it after an artificial convention for the establishment of these rules as shall be shewn more at large hereafter  Secondly  if we suppose that the loan was secret and that it is necessary for the interest of  the person that the money be restor'd in the same manner as when the lender wou'd conceal his riches in that case the example ceases and the public is no longer interested in the actions of the borrower tho' I suppose there is no moralist who will affirm that the duty and obligation ceases  Thirdly  experience sufficiently proves that men in the ordinary conduct of life look not so far as the public interest when they pay their creditors perform their promises and abstain from theft and robbery and injustice of every kind That is a motive too remote and too sublime to affect the generality of mankind and operate with any force in actions so contrary to private interest as are frequently those of justice and common honesty  IN general it may be affirm'd that there is no such passion in human minds as the love of mankind merely as such independent of personal qualities of services or of relation to ourself 'Tis true there is no human and indeed no sensible creature whose happiness or misery does not in some measure affect us when brought near to us and represented in lively colours But this proceeds merely from sympathy and is no proof of such an universal affection to mankind  since this concern extends itself beyond our own species An affection betwixt the sexes is a passion evidently implanted in human nature and this passion not only appears in its peculiar symptoms but also in inflaming every other principle of affection and raising a stronger love from beauty wit kindness than what wou'd otherwise flow from them Were there an universal love among all human creatures it wou'd appear after the same manner Any degree of a good quality wou'd cause a stronger affection than the same degree of a bad quality wou'd cause hatred contrary to what we find by experience Men's tempers are different and some have a propensity to the tender and others to the rougher affections But in the main we may affirm that man in general or human nature is nothing but the object both of love and hatred and requires some other cause which by a double relation of impressions and ideas may excite these passions In vain wou'd we endeavour to elude this hypothesis There are no phaenomena that point out any such kind affection to men independent of their merit and every other circumstance We love company in general but 'tis as we love any other amusement An  Englishman  in  Italy  is a friend A  Europaean  in  China  and perhaps a man wou'd be belov'd as such were we to meet him in the moon But this proceeds only from the relation to ourselves which in these cases gathers force by being confined to a few persons  IF public benevolence therefore or a regard to the interests of mankind cannot be the original motive to justice much less can  private benevolence  or a  regard to the interests of the party concern'd  be this motive For what if he be my enemy and has given me just cause to hate him What if he be a vicious man and deserves the hatred of all mankind What if he be a miser and can make no use of what I wou'd deprive him of What if he be a profligate debauchee and wou'd rather receive harm than benefit from large possessions What if I be in necessity and have urgent motives to acquire something to my family In all these cases the original motive to justice wou'd fail and consequently the justice itself and along with it all property right and obligation  A RICH man lies under a moral obligation to communicate to those in necessity a share of his superfluities Were private benevolence the original motive to justice a  man wou'd not be oblig'd to leave others in the possession of more than he is oblig'd to give them At least the difference wou'd be very inconsiderable Men generally fix their affections more on what they are possess'd of than on what they never enjoy'd For this reason it wou'd be greater cruelty to dispossess a man of any thing than not to give it him But who will assert that this is the only foundation of justice  BESIDES we must consider that the chief reason why men attach themselves so much to their possessions is that they consider them as their property and as secur'd to them inviolably by the laws of society But this is a secondary consideration and dependent on the preceding notions of justice and property  A MAN'S property is suppos'd to be fenc'd against every mortal in every possible case But private benevolence is and ought to be weaker in some persons than in others And in many or indeed in most persons must absolutely fail Private benevolence therefore is not the original motive of justice  FROM all this it follows that we have no real or universal motive for observing the laws of equity but the very equity and merit  of that observance and as no action can be equitable or meritorious where it cannot arise from some separate motive there is here an evident sophistry and reasoning in a circle Unless therefore we will allow that nature has establish'd a sophistry and render'd it necessary and unavoidable we must allow that the sense of justice and injustice is not deriv'd from nature but arises artificially tho' necessarily from education and human conventions  I SHALL add as a corollary to this reasoning that since no action can be laudable or blameable without some motives or impelling passions distinct from the sense of morals these distinct passions must have a great influence on that sense 'Tis according to their general force in human nature that we blame or praise In judging of the beauty of animal bodies we always carry in our eye the oeconomy of a certain species and where the limbs and features observe that proportion which is common to the species we pronounce them handsome and beautiful In like manner we always consider the  natural  and  usual  force of the passions when we determine concerning vice and virtue and if the passions depart very much from the common measures on either  side they are always disapprov'd as vicious A man naturally loves his children better than his nephews his nephews better than his cousins his cousins better than strangers where every thing else is equal Hence arise our common measures of duty in preferring the one to the other Our sense of duty always follows the common and natural course of our passions  TO avoid giving offence I must here observe that when I deny justice to be a natural virtue I make use of the word  natural  only as oppos'd to  artificial  In another sense of the word as no principle of the human mind is more natural than a sense of virtue so no virtue is more natural than justice Mankind is an inventive species and where an invention is obvious and absolutely necessary it may as properly be said to be natural as any thing that proceeds immediately from original principles without the intervention of thought or reflection Tho' the rules of justice be  artificial  they are not  arbitrary  Nor is the expression improper to call them  Laws of Nature  if by natural we understand what is common to any species or even if we confine it to mean what is inseparable from the species  SECT II  Of the origin of justice and property  WE now proceed to examine two questions viz  concerning the manner in which the rules of justice are establish'd by the artifice of men  and  concerning the reasons which determine us to attribute to the observance or neglect of these rules a moral beauty and deformity  These questions will appear afterwards to be distinct We shall begin with the former  OF all the animals with which this globe is peopled there is none towards whom nature seems at first sight to have exercis'd more cruelty than towards man in the numberless wants and necessities with which she has loaded him and in the slender means which she affords to the relieving these necessities In other creatures these two particulars generally compensate each other If we consider the lion as a voracious and carnivorous animal we shall easily discover him to be very necessitous but if we turn  our eye to his make and temper his agility his courage his arms and his force we shall find that his advantages hold proportion with his wants The sheep and ox are depriv'd of all these advantages but their appetites are moderate and their food is of easy purchase In man alone this unnatural conjunction of infirmity and of necessity may be observ'd in its greatest perfection Not only the food which is requir'd for his sustenance flies his search and approach or at least requires his labour to be produc'd but he must be possess'd of cloaths and lodging to defend him against the injuries of the weather tho' to consider him only in himself he is provided neither with arms nor force nor other natural abilities which are in any degree answerable to so many necessities  'TIS by society alone he is able to supply his defects and raise himself up to an equality with his fellowcreatures and even acquire a superiority above them By society all his infirmities are compensated and tho' in that situation his wants multiply every moment upon him yet his abilities are still more augmented and leave him in every respect more satisfied and happy than 'tis possible for him in his savage and solitary  condition ever to become When every individual person labours apart and only for himself his force is too small to execute any considerable work his labour being employ'd in supplying all his different necessities he never attains a perfection in any particular art and as his force and success are not at all times equal the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery Society provides a remedy for these  three  inconveniences By the conjunction of forces our power is augmented By the partition of employments our ability encreases And by mutual succour we are less expos'd to fortune and accidents 'Tis by this additional  force ability  and  security  that society becomes advantageous  BUT in order to form society 'tis requisite not only that it be advantageous but also that men be sensible of these advantages and 'tis impossible in their wild uncultivated state that by study and reflection alone they should ever be able to attain this knowledge Most fortunately therefore there is conjoin'd to those necessities whose remedies are remote and obscure another necessity which having a present and more obvious remedy may justly be regarded as  the first and original principle of human society This necessity is no other than that natural appetite betwixt the sexes which unites them together and preserves their union till a new tye takes place in their concern for their common offspring This new concern becomes also a principle of union betwixt the parents and offspring and forms a more numerous society where the parents govern by the advantage of their superior strength and wisdom and at the same time are restrain'd in the exercise of their authority by that natural affection which they bear their children In a little time custom and habit operating on the tender minds of the children makes them sensible of the advantages which they may reap from society as well as fashions them by degrees for it by rubbing off those rough corners and untoward affections which prevent their coalition  FOR it must be confest that however the circumstances of human nature may render an union necessary and however those passions of lust and natural affection may seem to render it unavoidable yet there are other particulars in our  natural temper  and in our  outward circumstances  which are very incommodious and are even contrary to the  requisite conjunction Among the former we may justly esteem our  selfishness  to be the most considerable I am sensible that generally speaking the representations of this quality have been carried much too far and that the descriptions which certain philosophers delight so much to form of mankind in this particular are as wide of nature as any accounts of monsters which we meet with in fables and romances So far from thinking that men have no affection for any thing beyond themselves I am of opinion that tho' it be rare to meet with one who loves any single person better than himself yet 'tis as rare to meet with one in whom all the kind affections taken together do not overbalance all the selfish Consult common experience Do you not see that tho' the whole expence of the family be generally under the direction of the master of it yet there are few that do not bestow the largest part of their fortunes on the pleasures of their wives and the education of their children reserving the smallest portion for their own proper use and entertainment This is what we may observe concerning such as have those endearing ties and may presume that the case would  be the same with others were they plac'd in a like situation  BUT tho' this generosity must be acknowledg'd to the honour of human nature we may at the same time remark that so noble an affection instead of fitting men for large societies is almost as contrary to them as the most narrow selfishness For while each person loves himself better than any other single person and in his love to others bears the greatest affection to his relations and acquaintance this must necessarily produce an opposition of passions and a consequent opposition of actions which cannot but be dangerous to the newestablish'd union  'TIS however worth while to remark that this contrariety of passions wou'd be attended with but small danger did it not concur with a peculiarity in our  outward circumstances  which affords it an opportunity of exerting itself There are three different species of goods which we are possess'd of the internal satisfaction of our minds the external advantages of our body and the enjoyment of such possessions as we have acquir'd by our industry and good fortune We are perfectly secure in the enjoyment of the first The second may be ravish'd from us but can be of no advantage to him who  deprives us of them The last only are both expos'd to the violence of others and may be transferr'd without suffering any loss or alteration while at the same time there is not a sufficient quantity of them to supply every one's desires and necessities As the improvement therefore of these goods is the chief advantage of society so the  instability  of their possession along with their  scarcity  is the chief impediment  IN vain shou'd we expect to find in  uncultivated nature  a remedy to this inconvenience or hope for any inartificial principle of the human mind which might controul those partial affections and make us overcome the temptations arising from cur circumstances The idea of justice can never serve to this purpose or be taken for a natural principle capable of inspiring men with an equitable conduct towards each other That virtue as it is now understood wou'd never have been dream'd of among rude and savage men For the notion of injury or injustice implies an immorality or vice committed against some other person And as every immorality is deriv'd from some defect or unsoundness of the passions and as this defect must be judg'd of in a great measure from the ordinary course of nature in  the constitution of the mind 'twill be easy to know whether we be guilty of any immorality with regard to others by considering the natural and usual force of those several affections which are directed towards them Now it appears that in the original frame of our mind our strongest attention is confin'd to ourselves our next is extended to our relations and acquaintance and 'tis only the weakest which reaches to strangers and indifferent persons This partiality then and unequal affection must not only have an influence on our behaviour and conduct in society but even on our ideas of vice and virtue so as to make us regard any remarkable transgression of such a degree of partiality either by too great an enlargement or contraction of the affections as vicious and immoral This we may observe in our common judgments concerning actions where we blame a person who either centers all his affections in his family or is so regardless of them as in any opposition of interest to give the preference to a stranger or mere chance acquaintance From all which it follows that our natural uncultivated ideas of morality instead of providing a remedy for the partiality of our affections do rather conform themselves to  that partiality and give it an additional force and influence  THE remedy then is not deriv'd from nature but from  artifice  or more properly speaking nature provides a remedy in the judgment and understanding for what is irregular and incommodious in the affections For when men from their early education in society have become sensible of the infinite advantages that result from it and have besides acquir'd a new affection to company and conversation and when they have observ'd that the principal disturbance in society arises from those goods which we call external and from their looseness and easy transition from one person to another they must seek for a remedy by putting these goods as far as possible on the same footing with the fix'd and constant advantages of the mind and body This can be done after no other manner than by a convention enter'd into by all the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of those external goods and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and industry By this means every one knows what he may safely possess and the passions are restrain'd in their partial and contradictory  motions Nor is such a restraint contrary to these passions for if so it cou'd never be enter'd into nor maintain'd but it is only contrary to their heedless and impetuous movement Instead of departing from our own interest or from that of our nearest friends by abstaining from the possessions of others we cannot better consult both these interests than by such a convention because it is by that means we maintain society which is so necessary to their wellbeing and subsistence as well as to our own  THIS convention is not of the nature of a  promise  For even promises themselves as we shall see afterwards arise from human conventions It is only a general sense of common interest which sense all the members of the society express to one another and which induces them to regulate their conduct by certain rules I observe that it will be for my interest to leave another in the possession of his goods  provided  he will act in the same manner with regard to me He is sensible of a like interest in the regulation of his conduct When this common sense of interest is mutually express'd and is known to both it produces a suitable resolution and behaviour And this may properly enough be call'd a convention or agreement  betwixt us tho' without the interposition of a promise since the actions of each of us have a reference to those of the other and are perform'd upon the supposition that something is to be perform'd on the other part Two men who pull the oars of a boat do it by an agreement or convention tho' they have never given promises to each other Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv'd from human conventions that it arises gradually and acquires force by a slow progression and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it On the contrary this experience assures us still more that the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct And 'tis only on the expectation of this that our moderation and abstinence are founded In like manner are languages gradually establish'd by human conventions without any promise In like manner do gold and silver become the common measures of exchange and are esteem'd sufficient payment for what is of a hundred times their value  AFTER this convention concerning abstinence from the possessions of others is enter'd into and every one has acquir'd  a stability in his possessions there immediately arise the ideas of justice and injustice as also those of  property right  and  obligation  The latter are altogether unintelligible without first understanding the former Our property is nothing but those goods whose constant possession is establish'd by the laws of society that is by the laws of justice Those therefore who make use of the words  property  or  right  or  obligation  before they have explain'd the origin of justice or even make use of it in that explication are guilty of a very gross fallacy and can never reason upon any solid foundation A man's property is some object related to him This relation is not natural but moral and founded on justice 'Tis very preposterous therefore to imagine that we can have any idea of property without fully comprehending the nature of justice and shewing its origin in the artifice and contrivance of men The origin of justice explains that of property The same artifice gives rise to both As our first and most natural sentiment of morals is founded on the nature of our passions and gives the preference to ourselves and friends above strangers 'tis impossible there can be naturally any such thing as a fix'd right or property  while the opposite passions of men impel them in contrary directions and are not restrain'd by any convention or agreement  No one can doubt that the convention for the distinction of property and for the stability of possession is of all circumstances the most necessary to the establishment of human society and that after the agreement for the fixing and observing of this rule there remains little or nothing to be done towards settling a perfect harmony and concord All the other passions beside this of interest are either easily restrain'd or are not of such pernicious consequence when indulg'd  Vanity  is rather to be esteem'd a social passion and a bond of union among men  Pity  and  love  are to be consider'd in the same light And as to  envy  and  revenge  tho' pernicious they operate only by intervals and are directed against particular persons whom we consider as our superiors or enemies This avidity alone of acquiring goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends is insatiable perpetual universal and directly destructive of society There scarce is any one who is not actuated by it and there is no one who has not reason to fear from it when it acts without  any restraint and gives way to its first and most natural movements So that upon the whole we are to esteem the difficulties in the establishment of society to be greater or less according to those we encounter in regulating and restraining this passion  'TIS certain that no affection of the human mind has both a sufficient force and a proper direction to counterbalance the love of gain and render men fit members of society by making them abstain from the possessions of others Benevolence to strangers is too weak for this purpose and as to the other passions they rather inflame this avidity when we observe that the larger our possessions are the more ability we have of gratifying all our appetites There is no passion therefore capable of controlling the interested affection but the very affection it self by an alteration of its direction Now this alteration must necessarily take place upon the least reflection since 'tis evident that the passion is much better satisfy'd by its restraint than by its liberty and that in preserving society we make much greater advances in the acquiring possessions than in the solitary and forlorn condition which must follow upon violence and an universal licence The question therefore concerning  the wickedness or goodness of human nature enters not in the least into that other question concerning the origin of society nor is there any thing to be consider'd but the degrees of men's sagacity or folly For whether the passion of selfinterest be esteemed vicious or virtuous 'tis all a case since itself alone restrains it So that if it be virtuous men become social by their virtue if vicious their vice has the same effect  Now as 'tis by establishing the rule for the stability of possession that this passion restrains itself if that rule be very abstruse and of difficult invention society must be esteem'd in a manner accidental and the effect of many ages But if it be found that nothing can be more simple and obvious than that rule that every parent in order to preserve peace among his children must establish it and that these first rudiments of justice must every day be improv'd as the society enlarges If all this appear evident as it certainly must we may conclude that 'tis utterly impossible for men to remain any considerable time in that savage condition which precedes society but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem'd social This however hinders not but that philosophers may if they please  extend their reasoning to the suppos'd  state of nature  provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction which never had and never cou'd have any reality Human nature being compos'd of two principal parts which are requisite in all its actions the affections and understanding 'tis certain that the blind motions of the former without the direction of the latter incapacitate men for society And it may be allow'd us to consider separately the effects that result from the separate operations of these two component parts of the mind The same liberty may be permitted to moral which is allow'd to natural philosophers and 'tis very usual with the latter to consider any motion as compounded and consisting of two parts separate from each other tho' at the same time they acknowledge it to be in itself uncompounded and inseparable  THIS  state of nature  therefore is to be regarded as a mere fiction not unlike that of the  golden age  which poets have invented only with this difference that the former is describ'd as full of war violence and injustice whereas the latter is painted out to us as the most charming and most peaceable condition that can possibly be imagin'd The seasons in that first age of nature  were so temperate if we may believe the poets that there was no necessity for men to provide themselves with cloaths and houses as a security against the violence of heat and cold The rivers flow'd with wine and milk The oaks yielded honey and nature spontaneously produc'd her greatest delicacies Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age The storms and tempests were not alone remov'd from nature but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts which now cause such uproar and engender such confusion Avarice ambition cruelty selfishness were never heard of Cordial affection compassion sympathy were the only movements with which the human mind was yet acquainted Even the distinction of  mine  and  thine  was banish'd from that happy race of mortals and carry'd with them the very notions of property and obligation justice and injustice  THIS no doubt is to be regarded as an idle fiction but yet deserves our attention because nothing can more evidently shew the origin of those virtues which are the subjects of our present enquiry I have already observ'd that justice takes its rise from human conventions and that these are intended  as a remedy to some inconveniences which proceed from the concurrence of certain  qualities  of the human mind with the  situation  of external objects The qualities of the mind are  selfishness  and  limited generosity  And the situation of external objects is their  easy change  join'd to their  scarcity  in comparison of the wants and desires of men But however philosophers may have been bewilder'd in those speculations poets have been guided more infallibly by a certain taste or common instinct which in most kinds of reasoning goes farther than any of that art and philosophy with which we have been yet acquainted They easily perceiv'd if every man had a tender regard for another or if nature supplied abundantly all our wants and desires that the jealousy of interest which justice supposes could no longer have place nor would there be any occasion for those distinctions and limits of property and possession which at present are in use among mankind Encrease to a sufficient degree the benevolence of men or the bounty of nature and you render justice useless by supplying its place with much nobler virtues and more valuable blessings The selfishness of men is animated by the few possessions we have in proportion  to our wants and 'tis to restrain this selfishness that men have been oblig'd to separate themselves from the community and to distinguish betwixt their own goods and those of others  NOR need we have recourse to the fictions of poets to learn this but beside the reason of the thing may discover the same truth by common experience and observation 'Tis easy to remark that a cordial affecton renders all things common among friends and that married people in particular mutually lose their property and are unacquainted with the  mine  and  thine  which are so necessary and yet cause such disturbance in human society The same effect arises from any alteration in the circumstances of mankind as when there is such a plenty of any thing as satisfies all the desires of men In which case the distinction of property is entirely lost and every thing remains in common This we may observe with regard to air and water tho' the most valuable of all external objects and may easily conclude that if men were supplied with every thing in the same abundance or if  every one  had the same affection and tender regard for  every one  as for himself justice and injustice would be equally unknown among mankind  HERE then is a proposition which I think may be regarded as certain  that 'tis only from the selfishness and confin'd generosity of men along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants that justice derives its origin  If we look backward we shall find that this proposition bestows an additional force on some of those observations which we have already made on this subject  First  we may conclude from it that a regard to public interest or a strong extensive benevolence is not our first and original motive for the observation of the rules of justice since 'tis allow'd that if men were endow'd with such a benevolence these rules would never have been dreamt of  Secondly  we may conclude from the same principle that the sense of justice is not founded on reason or on the discovery of certain connexions and relations of ideas which are eternal immutable and universally obligatory For since it is confest that such an alteration as that abovemention'd in the temper and circumstances of mankind wou'd entirely alter our duties and obligations 'tis necessary upon the common system  that the sense of virtue is deriv'd from reason  to shew  the change which this must produce in the relations and ideas But 'tis evident that the only cause why the extensive generosity of man and the perfect abundance of every thing wou'd destroy the very idea of justice is because they render it useless and that on the other hand his confin'd benevolence and his necessitous condition give rise to that virtue only by making it requisite to the publick interest and to that of every individual 'Twas therefore a concern for our own and the publick interest which made us establish the laws of justice and nothing can be more certain than that it is not any relation of ideas which gives us this concern but our impressions and sentiments without which every thing in nature is perfectly indifferent to us and can never in the least affect us The sense of justice therefore is not founded on our ideas but on our impressions  Thirdly  we may farther confirm the foregoing proposition  that those impressions which give rise to this sense of justice are not natural to the mind of man but arise from artifice and human conventions  For since any considerable alteration of temper and circumstances destroys equally justice and injustice and since such an alteration has an  effect only by changing our own and the publick interest it follows that the first establishment of the rules of justice depends on these different interests But if men pursu'd the publick interest naturally and with a hearty affection they wou'd never have dream'd of restraining each other by these rules and if they pursu'd their own interest without any precaution they wou'd run headlong into every kind of injustice and violence These rules therefore are artificial and seek their end in an oblique and indirect manner nor is the interest which gives rise to them of a kind that cou'd be pursu'd by the natural and inartificial passions of men  TO make this more evident consider that tho' the rules of justice are establish'd merely by interest their connexion with interest is somewhat singular and is different from what may be observ'd on other occasions A single act of justice is frequently contrary to  public interest  and were it to stand alone without being follow'd by other acts may in itself be very prejudicial to society When a man of merit of a beneficent disposition restores a great fortune to a miser or a seditious bigot he has acted justly and laudably but the public is a real sufferer Nor is  every single act of justice consider'd apart more conducive to private interest than to public and 'tis easily conceiv'd how a man may impoverish himself by a signal instance of integrity and have reason to wish that with regard to that single act the laws of justice were for a moment suspended in the universe But however single acts of justice may be contrary either to public or private interest 'tis certain that the whole plan or scheme is highly conducive or indeed absolutely requisite both to the support of society and the wellbeing of every individual 'Tis impossible to separate the good from the ill Property must be stable and must be fix'd by general rules Tho' in one instance the public be a sufferer this momentary ill is amply compensated by the steady prosecution of the rule and by the peace and order which it establishes in society And even every individual person must find himself a gainer on ballancing the account since without justice society must immediately dissolve and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition which is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppos'd in society When therefore men have had experience enough to observe that whatever  may be the consequence of any single act of justice perform'd by a single person yet the whole system of actions concurr'd in by the whole society is infinitely advantageous to the whole and to every part it is not long before justice and property take place Every member of society is sensible of this interest Every one expresses this sense to his fellows along with the resolution he has taken of squaring his actions by it on condition that others will do the same No more is requisite to induce any one of them to perform an act of justice who has the first opportunity This becomes an example to others And thus justice establishes itself by a kind of convention or agreement that is by a sense of interest suppos'd to be common to all and where every single act is perform'd in expectation that others are to perform the like Without such a convention no one wou'd ever have dream'd that there was such a virtue as justice or have been induc'd to conform his actions to it Taking any single act my justice may be pernicious in every respect and 'tis only upon the supposition that others are to imitate my example that I can be induc'd to embrace that virtue since nothing but this combination can render justice advantageous  or afford me any motives to conform my self to its rules  WE come now to the  second  question we propos'd  viz Why we annex the idea of virtue to justice and of vice to injustice  This question will not detain us long after the principles which we have already establish'd All we can say of it at present will be dispatch'd in a few words And for farther satisfaction the reader must wait till we come to the  third  part of this book The  natural  obligation to justice  viz  interest has been fully explain'd but as to the  moral  obligation or the sentiment of right and wrong 'twill first be requisite to examine the natural virtues before we can give a full and satisfactory account of it  AFTER men have found by experience that their selfishness and confin'd generosity acting at their liberty totally incapacitate them for society and at the same time have observ'd that society is necessary to the satisfaction of those very passions they are naturally induc'd to lay themselves under the restraint of such rules as may render their commerce more safe and commodious To the imposition then and observance of these rules both in general and in every particular  instance they are at first induc'd only by a regard to interest and this motive on the first formation of society is sufficiently strong and forcible But when society has become numerous and has encreas'd to a tribe or nation this interest is more remote nor do men so readily perceive that disorder and confusion follow upon every breach of these rules as in a more narrow and contracted society But tho' in our own actions we may frequently lose sight of that interest which we have in maintaining order and may follow a lesser and more present interest we never fail to observe the prejudice we receive either mediately or immediately from the injustice of others as not being in that case either blinded by passion or byass'd by any contrary temptation Nay when the injustice is so distant from us as no way to affect our interest it still displeases us because we consider it as prejudicial to human society and pernicious to every one that approaches the person guilty of it We partake of their uneasiness by  sympathy  and as every thing which gives uneasiness in human actions upon the general survey is call'd Vice and whatever produces satisfaction in the same manner is denominated Virtue this is the reason why the sense of moral good and evil follows upon justice and injustice And tho' this sense in  the present case be deriv'd only from contemplating the actions of others yet we sail not to extend it even to our own actions The  general rule  reaches beyond those instances from which it arose while at the same time we naturally  sympathize  with others in the sentiments they entertain of us  Thus selfinterest is the original motive to the  establishment  of justice but a  sympathy  with public interest is the source of the  moral approbation  which attends that virtue  THO' this progress of the sentiments be  natural  and even necessary 'tis certain that it is here forwarded by the artifice of politicians who in order to govern men more easily and preserve peace in human society have endeavour'd to produce an esteem for justice and an abhorrence of injustice This no doubt must have its effect but nothing can be more evident than that the matter has been carry'd too far by certain writers on morals who seem to have employ'd their utmost efforts to extirpate all sense of virtue from among mankind Any artifice of politicians may assist nature in the producing of those sentiments which she suggests to us and may even on some occasions produce alone an approbation or esteem for any particular action but 'tis impossible it should be the sole cause of the dictinction we make betwixt vice and virtue  For if nature did not aid us in this particular 'twou'd be in vain for politicians to talk of  honourable  or  dishonourable praiseworthy  or  blameable  These words wou'd be perfectly unintelligible and wou'd no more have any idea annex'd to them than if they were of a tongue perfectly unknown to us The utmost politicians can perform is to extend the natural sentiments beyond their original bounds but still nature must furnish the materials and give us some notion of moral distinctions  AS publick praise and blame encrease our esteem for justice so private education and instruction contribute to the same effect For as parents easily observe that a man is the more useful both to himself and others the greater degree of probity and honour he is endow'd with and that those principles have greater force when custom and education assist interest and reflection For these reasons they are induc'd to inculcate on their children from their earliest infancy the principles of probity and teach them to regard the observance of those rules by which society is maintain'd as worthy and honourable and their violation as base and infamous By this means the sentiments of honour may take root in their tender minds  and acquire such firmness and solidity that they may fall little short of those principles which are the most essential to our natures and the most deeply radicated in our internal constitution  WHAT farther contributes to encrease their solidity is the interest of our reputation after the opinion  that a merit or demerit attends justice or injustice  is once firmly establish'd among mankind There is nothing which touches us more nearly than our reputation and nothing on which our reputation more depends than our conduct with relation to the property of others For this reason every one who has any regard to his character or who intends to live on good terms with mankind must fix an inviolable law to himself never by any temptation to be induc'd to violate those principles which are essential to a man of probity and honour  I SHALL make only one observation before I leave this subject  viz  that tho' I assert that in the  state of nature  or that imaginary state which preceded society there be neither justice nor injustice yet I assert not that it was allowable in such a state to violate the property of others I only maintain that there was no such thing as property and consequently cou'd be no such  thing as justice or injustice I shall have occasion to make a similar reflection with regard to  promises  when I come to treat of them and I hope this reflection when duly weigh'd will suffice to remove all odium from the foregoing opinions with regard to justice and injustice  SECT III  Of the rules which determine property  THO' the establishment of the rule concerning the stability of possession be not only useful but even absolutely necessary to human society it can never serve to any purpose while it remains in such general terms Some method must be shewn by which we may distinguish what particular goods are to be assign'd to each particular person while the rest of mankind are excluded from their possession and enjoyment Our next business then must be to discover the reasons which modify this general rule and fit it to the common use and practice of the world  'TIS obvious that those reasons are not deriv'd from any utility or advantage which  either the  particular  person or the public may reap from his enjoyment of any  particular  goods beyond what wou'd result from the possession of them by any other person 'Twere better no doubt that every one were possess'd of what is most suitable to him and proper for his use But besides that this relation of fitness may be common to several at once 'tis liable to so many controversies and men are so partial and passionate in judging of these controversies that such a loose and uncertain rule wou'd be absolutely incompatible with the peace of human society The convention concerning the stability of possession is enter'd into in order to cut off all occasions of discord and contention and this end wou'd never be attain'd were we allow'd to apply this rule differently in every particular case according to every particular utility which might be discover'd in such an application Justice in her decisions never regards the fitness or unfitness of objects to particular persons but conducts herself by more extensive views Whether a man be generous or a miser he is equally well receiv'd by her and obtains with the same facility a decision in his favours even for what is entirely useless to him  IT follows therefore that the general rule  that possession must be stable  is not apply'd by particular judgments but by other general rules which must extend to the whole society and be inflexible either by spite or favour To illustrate this I propose the following instance I first consider men in their savage and solitary condition and suppose that being sensible of the misery of that state and foreseeing the advantages that wou'd result from society they seek each other's company and make an offer of mutual protection and assistance I also suppose that they are endow'd with such sagacity as immediately to perceive that the chief impediment to this project of society and partnership lies in the avidity and selfishness of their natural temper to remedy which they enter into a convention for the stability of possession and for mutual restraint and forbearance I am sensible that this method of proceeding is not altogether natural but besides that I here only suppose those reflections to be form'd at once which in fact arise insensibly and by degrees besides this I say 'tis very possible that several persons being by different accidents separated from the societies to which they formerly belong'd may be oblig'd to form a new society  among themselves in which case they are entirely in the situation abovemention'd  'TIS evident then that their first difficulty in this situation after the general convention for the establishment of society and for the constancy of possession is how to separate their possessions and assign to each his particular portion which he must for the future inalterably enjoy This difficulty will not detain them long but it must immediately occur to them as the most natural expedient that every one continue to enjoy what he is at present master of and that property or constant possession be conjoin'd to the immediate possession Such is the effect of custom that it not only reconciles us to any thing we have long enjoy'd but even gives us an affection for it and makes us prefer it to other objects which may be more valuable but are less known to us What has long lain under our eye and has often been employ'd to our advantage  that  we are always the most unwilling to part with but can easily live without possessions which we never have enjoy'd and are not accustom'd to 'Tis evident therefore that men wou'd easily acquiesce in this expedient  that every one continue to enjoy what he is at present possess'd of  and this is the reason why they wou'd so naturally agree in preferring it  No questions in philosophy are more difficult than when a number of causes present themselves for the same phaenomenon to determine which is the principal and predominant There seldom is any very precise argument to fix our choice and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of taste or fancy arising from analogy and a comparison of similar instances Thus in the present case there are no doubt motives of public interest for most of the rules which determine property but still I suspect that these rules are principally fix'd by the imagination or the more frivolous properties of our thought and conception I shall continue to explain these causes leaving it to the reader's choice whether he will prefer those deriv'd from publick utility or those deriv'd from the imagination We shall begin with the right of the present possessor  'Tis a quality which  a Book  I  Part  IV  Sect  I have already observ'd in human nature that when two objects appear in a close relation to each other the mind is apt to ascribe to them any additional relation in order to compleat the union and this inclination is so strong as often to make us run into errors such as that of the conjunction of thought and matter if we find that they can serve to that purpose Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch merely because they are conjoin'd by causation and are already united in the imagination Since therefore we can feign a new relation and even an absurd one in order to compleat any union 'twill easily be imagin'd that if there be any relations which depend on the mind 'twill readily conjoin them to any preceding relation and unite by a new bond such objects as have already an union in the fancy Thus for instance we never fail in our arrangement of bodies to place those which are  resembling  in  contiguity  to each other or at least in  correspondent  points of view because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities And this is easily accounted for from the known properties of human nature When the mind is determin'd to join certain objects but undetermin'd in its choice of the particular objects it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together They are already united in the mind They present themselves at the same time to the conception and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction it wou'd require a very powerful reason to make us overlook this natural affinity This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards when we come to treat of  beauty  In the mean time we may content ourselves with observing that the same love of order and uniformity which arranges the books in a library and the chairs in a parlour contributer to the formation of society and to the wellbeing of mankind by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession And as property forms a relation betwixt a person and an object 'tis natural to found it on some preceding relation and as property is nothing but a constant possession secur'd by the laws of society 'tis natural to add it to the present possession which is a relation that resembles it For this also has its influence If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations 'tis more so to conjoin such relations as are resembling and are related together    BUT we may observe that tho' the rule of the assignment of property to the present possessor be natural and by that means useful  yet its utility extends not beyond the first formation of society nor wou'd any thing be more pernicious than the constant observance of it by which restitution wou'd be excluded and every injustice wou'd be authoriz'd and rewarded We must therefore seek for some other circumstance that may give rise to property after society is once establish'd and of this kind I find four most considerable  viz  Occupation Prescription Accession and Succession We shall  briefly examine each of these beginning with  Occupation  THE possession of all external goods is changeable and uncertain which is one of the most considerable impediments to the establishment of society and is the reason why by universal agreement express or tacite men restrain themselves by what we now call the rules of justice and equity The misery of the condition which precedes this restraint is the cause why we submit to that remedy as quickly as possible and this affords us an easy reason why we annex the idea of property to the first possession or to  occupation  Men are unwilling to leave property in suspence even for the shortest time or open the least door to violence and disorder To which we may add that the first possession always engages the attention most and did we neglect it there wou'd be no colour of reason for assigning property to any succeeding possession  Some philosophers account for the right of occupation by saying that every one has a property in his own labour and when he joins that labour to any thing it gives him the property of the whole But There are several kinds of occupation where we cannot be said to join our labour to the object we acquire As when we possess a meadow by grazing our cattle upon it This accounts for the matter by means of  accession  which is taking a needless circuit We cannot be said to join our labour to any thing but in a figurative sense Properly speaking we only make an alteration on it by our labour This forms a relation betwixt us and the object and thence arises the property according to the preceding principles    THERE remains nothing but to determine exactly what is meant by possession and this is not so easy as may at first sight be imagin'd We are said to be in possession of any thing not only when we immediately touch it but also when we are so situated with respect to it as to have it in our power to use it and may move alter or destroy it according to our present pleasure or advantage This relation then is a species of cause and effect and as property is nothing but a stable possession deriv'd from the rules of justice or the conventions of men 'tis to be consider'd as the same species of relation But here we may observe that as the power of using any object becomes more or less certain according as the interruptions we may meet with are more or less probable and as this probability may increase by insensible degrees 'tis in many cases impossible to determine when possession begins or ends nor is there any certain standard by which we can decide such controversies A wild boar that falls into our snares is deem'd to be in our possession if  it be impossible for him to escape But what do we mean by impossible How do we separate this impossibility from an improbability And how distinguish that exactly from a probability Mark the precise limits of the one and the other and shew the standard by which we may decide all disputes that may arise and as we find by experience frequently do arise upon this subject  If we seek a solution of these difficulties in reason and public interest we never shall find satisfaction and if we look for it in the imagination 'tis evident that the qualities which operate upon that faculty run so insensibly and gradually into each other that 'tis impossible to give them any precise bounds or termination The difficulties on this head must encrease when we consider that our judgment alters very sensibly according to the subject and that the same power and proximity will be deem'd possession in one case which is not esteem'd such in another A person who has hunted a hare to the last degree of weariness wou'd look upon it as an injustice for another to rush in before him and seize his prey But the same person advancing to pluck an apple that hangs within his reach has no reason to complain if another more alert passes him and takes possession What is the reason of this difference but that immobility not being natural to the hare but the effect of industry forms in that case a strong relation with the hunter which is wanting in the other  Here then it appears that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment without touch or some other sensible relation often produces not property And I farther observe that a sensible relation without any present power is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object The sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation and is only regarded as such when the object is hidden or very obscure in which case we find that the view alone conveys a property according to that maxim  that even a whole continent belongs to the nation which first discover'd it  'Tis however remarkable that both in the case of discovery and that of possession the first discoverer and possessor must join to the relation an intention of rendering himself proprietor otherwise the relation will not have its effect and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not so great but that it requires to be help'd by such an intention  From all these circumstances 'tis easy to see how perplex'd many questions may become concerning the acquisition of property by occupation and the least effort of thought may present us with instances which are not susceptible of any reasonable decision If we prefer examples which are real to such as are feign'd we may consider the following one which is to be met with in almost every writer that has treated of the laws of nature Two  Grecian  colonies leaving their native country in search of new seats were inform'd that a city near them was deserted by its inhabitants To know the truth of this report they dispatch'd at once two messengers one from each colony who finding on their approach that their information was true begun a race together with an intention to take possession of the city each of them for his countrymen One of these messengers finding that he was not an equal match for the other launch'd his spear at the gates of the city and was so fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion This produc'd a dispute betwixt the two colonies which of them was the proprietor of the empty city and this dispute still subsists among philosophers For my part I find the dispute impossible to be decided and that because the whole question hangs upon the fancy which in this case is not possess'd of any precise or determinate standard upon which it can give sentence To make this evident let us consider that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies and not messengers or deputies their actions wou'd not have been of any consequence since in that case their relation to the colonies wou'd have been but feeble and imperfect Add to this that nothing determin'd them to run to the gates rather than the walls or any other part of the city but that the gates being the most obvious and remarkable part satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole as we find by the poets who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them Besides we may consider that the touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly possession no more than the piercing the gates with a spear but only forms a relation and there is a relation in the other case equally obvious tho' not perhaps of equal force Which of these relations then conveys a right and property or whether any of them be sufficient for that effect I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than myself    BUT such disputes may not only arise concerning the real existence of property and possession but also concerning their extent and these disputes are often susceptible of no decision or can be decided by no other faculty than the imagination A person who lands on the shore of a small island that is desart and uncultivated is deem'd its possessor from the very first moment and acquires  the property of the whole because the object is there bounded and circumscrib'd in the fancy and at the same time is proportion'd to the new possessor The same person landing on a desart island as large as  Great Britain  extends his property no farther than his immediate possession tho' a numerous colony are esteem'd the proprietors of the whole from the instant of their debarkment  BUT it often happens that the title of first possession becomes obscure thro' time and that 'tis impossible to determine many controversies which may arise concerning it In that case long possession or  prescription  naturally takes place and gives a person a sufficient property in any thing he enjoys The  nature of human society admits not of any great accuracy nor can we always remount to the first origin of things in order to determine their present condition Any considerable space of time sets objects at such a distance that they seem in a manner to lose their reality and have as little influence on the mind as if they never had been in being A man's title that is clear and certain at present will seem obscure and doubtful fifty years hence even tho' the facts on which it is founded shou'd be prov'd with the greatest evidence and certainty The same facts have not the same influence after so long an interval of time And this may be receiv'd as a convincing argument for our preceding doctrine with regard to property and justice Possession during a long tract of time conveys a title to any object But as 'tis certain that however every thing be produc'd in time there is nothing real that is produc'd by time it follows that property being produc'd by time is not any thing real in the objects but is the offspring of the sentiments on which alone time is found to have any influence  Present possession is plainly a relation betwixt a person and an object but is not sufficient to counterballance the relation of first possession unless the former be long and uninterrupted In which case the relation is encreas'd on the side of the present possession by the extent of time and diminish'd on that of first possession by the distance This change in the relation produces a consequent change in the property    WE acquire the property of objects by  accession  when they are connected in an intimate manner with objects that are already our property and at the same time are inferior to them Thus the fruits of our garden the offspring of our cattle and the work of our slaves are all of them esteem'd our property even before possession Where objects are connected together in the imagination they are apt to be put on the same footing and are commonly suppos'd to be endow'd with the same qualities We readily pass from one to the other and make no difference in our judgments concerning them especially if the latter be inferior to the former  This source of property can never be explain'd but from the imaginations and one may affirm that the causes are here unmix'd We shall proceed to explain them more particularly and illustrate them by examples from common life and experience  It has been observ'd above that the mind has a natural propensity to join relations especially resembling ones and finds a kind of fitness and uniformity in such an union From this propensity are deriv'd these laws of nature  that upon the first formation of society property always follows the present possession  and afterwards  that it arises from first or from long possession  Now we may easily observe that relation is not confin'd merely to one degree but that from an object that is related to us we acquire a relation to every other object which is related to it and so on till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress However the relation may weaken by each remove 'tis not immediately destroy'd but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one which is related to both And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the right of  accession  and causes us to acquire the property not only of such objects as we are immediately possess'd of but also of such as are closely connected with them  Suppose a  German  a  Frenchman  and a  Spaniard  to come into a room where there are plac'd upon the table three bottles of wine  Rhenish Burgundy  and  Port  and suppose they shou'd fall a quarrelling about the division of them a person who was chosen for umpire wou'd naturally to shew his impartiality give every one the product of his own country And this from a principle which in some measure is the source of those laws of nature that ascribe property to occupation prescription and accession  In all these cases and particularly that of accession there is first a  natural  union betwixt the idea of the person and that of the object and afterwards a new and  moral  union produc'd by that right or property which we ascribe to the person But here there occurs a difficulty which merits our attention and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning which has been employ'd on the present subject I have already observ'd that the imagination passes with greater facility from little to great than from great to little and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the former case than in the latter Now as the right of accession arises from the easy transition of ideas by which related objects are connected together it shou'd naturally be imagin'd that the right of accession must encrease in strength in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform'd with greater facility It may therefore be thought that when we have acquir'd the property of any small object we shall readily consider any great object related to it as an accession and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one since the transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one and shou'd connect them together in the closest manner But in fact the case is always found to be otherwise The empire of  Great Britain  seems to draw along with it the dominion of the  Orkneys  the  Hebrides  the isle of  Man  and the isle of  Wight  but the authority over those lesser islands does not naturally imply any title to  Great Britain  In short a small object naturally follows a great one as its accession but a great one is never suppos'd to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it merely on account of that property and relation Yet in this latter case the transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object which is his property and from the small object to the great one than in the former case from the proprietor to the great object and from the great one to the small It may therefore be thought that these phaenomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis  that the ascribing of property to accession is nothing but an affect of the relations of ideas and of the smooth transition of the imagination  'Twill be easy to solve this objection if we consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination with the different views in which it is continually placing its objects When we attribute to a person a property in two objects we do not always pass from the person to one object and from that to the other related to it The objects being here to be consider'd as the property of the person we are apt to join them together and place them in the same light Suppose therefore a great and a small object to be related together if a person be strongly related to the great object he will likewise be strongly related to both the objects consider'd together because he is related to the most considerable part On the contrary if he be only related to the small object he will not be strongly related to both consider'd together since his relation lies only with the most trivial part which is not apt to strike us in any great degree when we consider the whole And this is the reason why small objects become accessions to great ones and not great to small  'Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation and that because 'tis impossible to take possession of it or form any such distinct relation with it as may be the foundation of property Where this reason ceases property immediately takes place Thus the most strenuous advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow that friths and bays naturally belong as an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent These have properly no more bond or union with the land than the  pacific  ocean wou'd have but having an union in the fancy and being at the same time  inferior  they are of course regarded as an accession  The property of rivers by the laws of most nations and by the natural turn of our thought is attributed to the proprietors of their banks excepting such vast rivers as the  Rhine  or the  Danube  which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields Yet even these rivers are consider'd as the property of that nation thro' whose dominions they run the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them and bear them such a relation in the fancy  The accessions which are made to lands bordering upon rivers follow the land say the civilians provided it be made by what they call  alluvion  that is insensibly and imperceptibly which are circumstances that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank and join'd to another it becomes not his property whose land it falls on till it unite with the land and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both Before that the imagination does not sufficiently join them  There are other cases which somewhat resemble this of accession but which at the bottom are considerably different and merit our attention Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different persons after such a manner as not to admit of  separation  The question is to whom the united mass must belong  Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of  division  but not of  separation  the decision is natural and easy The whole mass must be suppos'd to be common betwixt the proprietors of the several parts and afterwards must be divided according to the proportions of these parts But here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the  Roman  law in distinguishing betwixt  confusion  and  commixtion  Confusion is an union of two bodies such as different liquors where the parts become entirely undistinguishable Commixtion is the blending of two bodies such as two bushels of corn where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner As in the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the former but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of each this is the reason why the  civil  law tho' it establish'd an entire community in the case of  confusion  and after that a proportional division yet in the case of  commixtion  supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a distinct right however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same division  Quod si frumentum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit siquidem ex voluntate vestra commune est quia singula corpora id est singula grana quae cujusque propria fuerunt ex consensu vestro communicata sunt Quod si casu id mistum fuerit vel Titius id miscuerit sine tua voluntate non videtur id commune esse quia singula corpora in sua substantia durant Sed nec magis istis casibus commune sit frumentum quam grex intelligitur esse communis si pecora Titii tuis pecoribus mista fuerint Sed si ab alterutro vestrûm totum id frumentum retineatur in rem quidem actio pro modo frumenti cujusque competit Arbitrio autem judicis ut ipse aestimet quale cujusque frumentum fuerit  Inst Lib II Tit §  Where the properties of two persons are united after such a manner as neither to admit of  division  nor  separation  as when one builds a house on another's ground in that case the whole must belong to one of the proprietors And here I assert that it naturally is conceiv'd to belong to the proprietor of the most considerable part For however the compound object may have a relation to two different persons and carry our view at once to both of them yet as the most considerable part principally engages our attention and by the strict union draws the inferior along it for this reason the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part and is regarded as his property The only difficulty is what we shall be pleas'd to call the most considerable part and most attractive to the imagination  This quality depends on several different circumstances which have little connexion with each other One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another either because it is more constant and durable because it is of greater value because it is more obvious and remarkable because it is of greater extent or because its existence is more separate and independent 'Twill be easy to conceive that as these circumstances may be conjoin'd and oppos'd in all the different ways and according to all the different degrees which can be imagin'd there will result many cases where the reasons on both sides are so equally ballanc'd that 'tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision Here then is the proper business of municipal laws to fix what the principles of human nature have left undetermin'd  The superficies yields to the soil says the civil law The writing to the paper The canvas to the picture These decisions do not well agree together and are a proof of the contrariety of those principles from which they are deriv'd  But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is that which for so many ages divided the disciples of  Proculus  and  Sabinus  Suppose a person shou'd make a cup from the metal of another or a ship from his wood and suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shou'd demand his goods the question is whether he acquires a title to the cup or ship  Sabinus  maintain'd the affirmative and asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities that it is incorruptible and immortal and therefore superior to the form which is casual and dependent On the other hand  Proculus  observ'd that the form is the most obvious and remarkable part and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular species To which he might have added that the matter or substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain that 'tis utterly impossible to trace it in all its changes For my part I know not from what principles such a controversy can be certainly determin'd I shall therefore content my self with observing that the decision of  Trebonian  seems to me pretty ingenious that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal because it can be brought back to its first form But that the ship belongs to the author of its form for a contrary reason But however ingenious this reason may seem it plainly depends upon the fancy which by the possibility of such a reduction finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood where the substance is more fix'd and unalterable    THE right of  succession  is a very natural one from the presum'd consent of the parent or near relation and from the general interest of mankind which requires that  men's possessions shou'd pass to those who are dearest to them in order to render them more industrious and frugal Perhaps these causes are seconded by the influence of  relation  or the association of ideas by which we are naturally directed to consider the son after the parent's decease and ascribe to him a title to his father's possessions Those goods  must become the property of some body But of  whom  is the question Here 'tis evident the persons children naturally present  themselves to the mind and being already connected to those possessions by means of  their deceas'd parent we are apt to connect them still farther by the relation of property Of this there are many parallel instances  In examining the different titles to authority in government we shall meet with many reasons to convince us that the right of succession depends in a great measure on the imagination Mean while I shall rest contented with observing one example which belongs to the present subject Suppose that a person die without children and that a dispute arises among his relations concerning his inheritance 'tis evident that if his riches be deriv'd partly from his father partly from his mother the most natural way of determining such a dispute is to divide his possessions and assign each part to the family from whence it is deriv'd Now as the person is suppos'd to have been once the full and entire proprietor of those goods I ask what is it makes us find a certain equity and natural reason in this partition except it be the imagination His affection to these families does not depend upon his possessions for which reason his consent can never be presum'd precisely for such a partition And as to the public interest it seems not to be in the least concern'd on the one side or the other    SECT IV  Of the transference of property by consent  HOWEVER useful or even necessary the stability of possession may be to human society 'tis attended with very considerable inconveniences The relation of fitness or suitableness ought never to enter into consideration in distributing the properties of mankind but we must govern ourselves by rules which are more general in their application and more free from doubt and uncertainty Of this kind is  present  possession upon the first establishment of society and afterwards  occupation prescription accession  and  succession  As these depend very much on chance they must frequently prove contradictory both to men's wants and desires and persons and possessions must often be very ill adjusted This is a grand inconvenience which calls for a remedy To apply one directly and allow every man to seize by violence what he judges to be fit for him wou'd destroy society and therefore the rules of justice  seek some medium betwixt a rigid stability and this changeable and uncertain adjustment But there is no medium better than that obvious one that possession and property shou'd always be stable except when the proprietor consents to bestow them on some other person This rule can have no ill consequence in occasioning wars and dissentions since the proprietor's consent who alone is concern'd is taken along in the alienation And it may serve to many good purposes in adjusting property to persons Different parts of the earth produce different commodities and not only so but different men both are by nature fitted for different employments and attain to greater perfection in any one when they confine themselves to it alone All this requires a mutual exchange and commerce for which reason the translation of property by consent is founded on a law of nature as well as its stability without such a consent  So far is determin'd by a plain utility and interest But perhaps 'tis from more trivial reasons that  delivery  or a sensible transference of the object is commonly requir'd by civil laws and also by the laws of nature according to most authors as a requisite circumstance in the translation of property  The property of an object when taken for something real without any reference to morality or the sentiments of the mind is a quality perfectly insensible and even inconceivable nor can we form any distinct notion either of its stability or translation This imperfection of our ideas is less sensibly felt with regard to its stability as it engages less our attention and is easily past over by the mind without any scrupulous examination But as the translation of property from one person to another is a more remarkable event the defect of our ideas becomes more sensible on that occasion and obliges us to turn ourselves on every side in search of some remedy Now as nothing more enlivens any idea than a present impression and a relation betwixt that impression and the idea 'tis natural for us to seek some false light from this quarter In order to aid the imagination in conceiving the transference of property we take the sensible object and actually transfer its possession to the person on whom we wou'd bestow the property The suppos'd resemblance of the actions and the presence of this sensible delivery deceive the mind and make it fancy that it conceives the mysterious transition of the property And that  this explication of the matter is just appears hence that men have invented a  symbolical  delivery to satisfy the fancy where the real one is impracticable Thus the giving the keys of a granary is understood to be the delivery of the corn contain'd in it The giving of stone and earth represents the delivery of a mannor This is a kind of superstitious practice in civil laws and in the laws of nature resembling the  Roman catholic  superstitions in religion As the  Roman catholics  represent the inconceivable mysteries of the  Christian  religion and render them more present to the mind by a taper or habit or grimace which is suppos'd to resemble them so lawyers and moralists have run into like inventions for the same reason and have endeavour'd by those means to satisfy themselves concerning the transference of property by consent  SECT V  Of the obligation of promises  THAT the rule of morality which enjoins the performance of promises is not  natural  will sufficiently appear from  these two propositions which I proceed to prove viz  that a promise wou'd not be intelligible before human conventions had establish'd it  and  that even if it were intelligible it wou'd not be attended with any moral obligation  I SAY  first  that a promise is not intelligible naturally nor antecedent to human conventions and that a man unacquainted with society could never enter into any engagements with another even tho' they could perceive each other's thoughts by intuition If promises be natural and intelligible there must be some act of the mind attending these words  I promise  and on this act of the mind must the obligation depend Let us therefore run over all the faculties of the soul and see which of them is exerted in our promises  THE act of the mind exprest by a promise is not a  resolution  to perform any thing For that alone never imposes any obligation Nor is it a  desire  of such a performance For we may bind ourselves without such a desire or even with an aversion declar'd and avow'd Neither is it the  willing  of that action which we promise to perform For a promise always regards some future time and the will has an influence  only on present actions It follows therefore that since the act of the mind which enters into a promise and produces its obligation is neither the resolving desiring nor willing any particular performance it must necessarily be the  willing  of that  obligation  which arises from the promise Nor is this only a conclusion of philosophy but is entirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of expressing ourselves when we say that we are bound by our own consent and that the obligation arises from our mere will and pleasure The only question then is whether there be not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind and such an absurdity as no man cou'd fall into whose ideas are not confounded with prejudice and the fallacious use of language  ALL morality depends upon our sentiments and when any action or quality of the mind pleases us  after a certain manner  we say it is virtuous and when the neglect or nonperformance of it displeases us  after a like manner  we say that we lie under an obligation to perform it A change of the obligation supposes a change of the sentiment and a creation of a new obligation supposes some new sentiment to arise But 'tis certain we can naturally no more  change our own sentiments than the motions of the heavens nor by a single act of our will that is by a promise render any action agreeable or disagreeable moral or immoral which without that act wou'd have produc'd contrary impressions or have been endow'd with different qualities It wou'd be absurd therefore to will any new obligation that is any new sentiment of pain or pleasure nor is it possible that men cou'd naturally fall into so gross an absurdity A promise therefore is  naturally  something altogether unintelligible nor is there any act of the mind belonging to it  Were morality discoverable by reason and not by sentiment 'twou'd be still more evident that promises cou'd make no alteration upon it Morality is suppos'd to consist in relation Every new imposition of morality therefore must arise from some new relation of objects and consequently the will cou'd not produce  immediately  any change in morals but cou'd have that effect only by producing a change upon the objects But as the moral obligation of a promise is the pure effect of the will without the least change in any part of the universe it follows that promises have no  natural  obligation  Shou'd it be said that this act of the will being in effect a new object produces new relations and new duties I wou'd answer that this is a pure sophism which may be detected by a very moderate share of accuracy and exactness To will a new obligation is to will a new relation of objects and therefore if this new relation of objects were form'd by the volition itself we shou'd in effect will the volition which is plainly absurd and impossible The will has here no object to which it cou'd tend but must return upon itself  in infinitum  The new obligation depends upon new relations The new relations depend upon a new volition The new volition has for object a new obligation and consequently new relations and consequently a new volition which volition again has in view a new obligation relation and volition without any termination 'Tis impossible therefore we cou'd ever will a new obligation and consequently 'tis impossible the will cou'd ever accompany a promise or produce a new obligation of morality    BUT  secondly  if there was any act of the mind belonging to it it could not  naturally  produce any obligation This appears evidently from the foregoing reasoning A promise creates a new obligation A new obligation supposes new sentiments to arise The will never creates new sentiments There could not naturally therefore arise any obligation from a promise even supposing the mind could fall into the absurdity of willing that obligation  THE same truth may be prov'd still more evidently by that reasoning which prov'd justice in general to be an artificial virtue No action can be requir'd of us as our duty unless there be implanted in human nature some actuating passion or motive capable of producing the action This motive cannot be the sense of duty A sense of duty supposes an antecedent obligation And where an action is not requir'd by any natural passion it cannot be requir'd by any natural obligation since it may be omitted without  proving any defect or imperfection in the mind and temper and consequently without any vice Now 'tis evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of promises distinct from a sense of duty If we thought that promises had no moral obligation we never shou'd feel any inclination to observe them This is not the case with the natural virtues Tho' there was no obligation to relieve the miserable our humanity wou'd lead us to it and when we omit that duty the immorality of the omission arises from its being a proof that we want the natural sentiments of humanity A father knows it to be his duty to take care of his children But he has also a natural inclination to it And if no human creature had that inclination no one cou'd lie under any such obligation But as there is naturally no inclination to observe promises distinct from a sense of their obligation it follows that fidelity is no natural virtue and that promises have no force antecedent to human conventions  IF any one dissent from this he must give a regular proof of these two propositions viz  that there is a peculiar act of the mind annext to promises  and  that consequent to this act of the mind there arises an  inclination to perform distinct from a sense of duty  I presume that it is impossible to prove either of these two points and therefore I venture to conclude that promises are human inventions founded on the necessities and interests of society  IN order to discover these necessities and interests we must consider the same qualities of human nature which we have already found to give rise to the preceding laws of society Men being naturally selfish or endow'd only with a confin'd generosity they are not easily induc'd to perform any action for the interest of strangers except with a view to some reciprocal advantage which they had no hope of obtaining but by such a performance Now as it frequently happens that these mutual performances cannot be finish'd at the same instant 'tis necessary that one party be contented to remain in uncertainty and depend upon the gratitude of the other for a return of kindness But so much corruption is there among men that generally speaking this becomes but a slender security and as the benefactor is here suppos'd to bestow his favours with a view to selfinterest this both takes off from the obligation and sets an example of selfishness which is the true  mother of ingratitude Were we therefore to follow the natural course of our passions and inclinations we shou'd perform but few actions for the advantage of others from disinterested views because we are naturally very limited in our kindness and affection And we shou'd perform as few of that kind out of a regard to interest because we cannot depend upon their gratitude Here then is the mutual commerce of good offices in a manner lost among mankind and every one reduc'd to his own skill and industry for his wellbeing and subsistence The invention of the law of nature concerning the  stability  of possession has already render'd men tolerable to each other that of the  transference  of property and possession by consent has begun to render them mutually advantageous But still these laws of nature however strictly observ'd are not sufficient to render them so serviceable to each other as by nature they are fitted to become Tho' possession be  stable  men may often reap but small advantage from it while they are possess'd of a greater quantity of any species of goods than they have occasion for and at the same time suffer by the want of others The  transference  of property which is the proper remedy  for this inconvenience cannot remedy it entirely because it can only take place with regard to such objects as are  present  and  individual  but not to such as are  absent  or  general  One cannot transfer the property of a particular house twenty leagues distant because the consent cannot be attended with delivery which is a requisite circumstance Neither can one transfer the property of ten bushels of corn or five hogsheads of wine by the mere expression and consent because these are only general terms and have no direct relation to any particular heap of corn or barrels of wine Besides the commerce of mankind is not confin'd to the barter of commodities but may extend to services and actions which we may exchange to our mutual interest and advantage Your corn is ripe today mine will be so tomorrow 'Tis profitable for us both that I shou'd labour with you today and that you shou'd aid me tomorrow I have no kindness for you and know you have as little for me I will not therefore take any pains upon your account and should I labour with you upon my own account in expectation of a return I know I shou'd be disappointed and that I shou'd in vain depend upon your gratitude Here then I  leave you to labour alone You treat me in the same manner The seasons change and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and security  ALL this is the effect of the natural and inherent principles and passions of human nature and as these passions and principles are inalterable it may be thought that our conduct which depends on them must be so too and that 'twou'd be in vain either for moralists or politicians to tamper with us or attempt to change the usual course of our actions with a view to public interest And indeed did the success of their designs depend upon their success in correcting the selfishness and ingratitude of men they wou'd never make any progress unless aided by omnipotence which is alone able to newmould the human mind and change its character in such fundamental articles All they can pretend to is to give a new direction to those natural passions and teach us that we can better satisfy our appetites in an oblique and artificial manner than by their headlong and impetuous motion Hence I learn to do a service to another without bearing him any real kindness because I forsee that he will return my service in expectation of another of the same  kind and in order to maintain the same correspondence of good offices with me or with others And accordingly after I have serv'd him and he is in possession of the advantage arising from my action he is induc'd to perform his part as foreseeing the consequences of his refusal  BUT tho' this selfinterested commerce of men begins to take place and to predominate in society it does not entirely abolish the more generous and noble intercourse of friendship and good offices I may still do services to such persons as I love and am more particularly acquainted with without any prospect of advantage and they may make me a return in the same manner without any view but that of recompensing my past services In order therefore to distinguish those two different sorts of commerce the interested and the disinterested there is a  certain form of words  invented for the former by which we bind ourselves to the performance of any action This form of words constitutes what we call a  promise  which is the sanction of the interested commerce of mankind When a man says  he promises any thing  he in effect expresses a  resolution  of performing it and along with that by making use of this  form of words  subjects himself to the penalty of never being trusted again in case of failure A resolution is the natural act of the mind which promises express But were there no more than a resolution in the case promises wou'd only declare our former motives and wou'd not create any new motive or obligation They are the conventions of men which create a new motive when experience has taught us that human affairs wou'd be conducted much more for mutual advantage were there certain  symbols  or  signs  instituted by which we might give each other security of our conduct in any particular incident After these signs are instituted whoever uses them is immediately bound by his interest to execute his engagements and must never expect to be trusted any more if he refuse to perform what he promis'd  NOR is that knowledge which is requisite to make mankind sensible of this interest in the  institution  and  observance  of promises to be esteem'd superior to the capacity of human nature however savage and uncultivated There needs but a very little practice of the world to make us perceive all these consequences and advantages The shortest experience of society discovers them to every mortal and when each individual perceives  the same sense of interest in all his fellows he immediately performs his part of any contract as being assur'd that they will not be wanting in theirs All of them by concert enter into a scheme of actions calculated for common benefit and agree to be true to their word nor is there any thing requisite to form this concert or convention but that every one have a sense of interest in the faithful fulfilling of engagements and express that sense to other members of the society This immediately causes that interest to operate upon them and interest is the  first  obligation to the performance of promises  AFTERWARDS a sentiment of morals concurs with interest and becomes a new obligation upon mankind This sentiment of morality in the performance of promises arises from the same principles as that in the abstinence from the property of others  Public interest education  and  the artifices of politicians  have the same effect in both cases The difficulties that occur to us in supposing a moral obligation to attend promises we either surmount or elude For instance the expression of a resolution is not commonly suppos'd to be obligatory and we cannot readily conceive how the  making use of a certain form of words shou'd be able to cause any material difference Here therefore we  feign  a new act of the mind which we call the  willing  an obligation and on this we suppose the morality to depend But we have prov'd already that there is no such act of the mind and consequently that promises impose no natural obligation  TO confirm this we may subjoin some other reflections concerning that will which is suppos'd to enter into a promise and to cause its obligation 'Tis evident that the will alone is never suppos'd to cause the obligation but must be express'd by words or signs in order to impose a type upon any man The expression being once brought in as subservient to the will soon becomes the principal part of the promise nor will a man be less bound by his word tho' he secretly give a different direction to his intention and withhold himself both from a resolution and from willing an obligation But tho' the expression makes on most occasions the whole of the promise yet it does not always so and one who shou'd make use of any expression of which he knows not the meaning and which he uses without any intention of binding himself wou'd not  certainly be bound by it Nay tho' he knows its meaning yet if he uses it in jest only and with such signs as shew evidently he has no serious intention of binding himself he wou'd not lie under any obligation of performance but 'tis necessary that the words be a perfect expression of the will without any contrary signs Nay even this we must not carry so far as to imagine that one whom by our quickness of understanding we conjecture from certain signs to have an intention of deceiving us is not bound by his expression or verbal promise if we accept of it but must limit this conclusion to those cases where the signs are of a different kind from those of deceit All these contradictions are easily accounted for if the obligation of promises be merely a human invention for the convenience of society but will never be explain'd if it be something  real  and  natural  arising from any action of the mind or body  I SHALL farther observe that since every new promise imposes a new obligation of morality on the person who promises and since this new obligation arises from his will 'tis one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagin'd and may even be compar'd to  transubstantiation  or  holy orders  I mean so far as holy orders are suppos'd to produce the  indelible character  In other respects they are only a legal qualification  where a certain form of words along with a certain intention changes entirely the nature of an external object and even of a human creature But tho' these mysteries be so far alike 'tis very remarkable that they differ widely in other particulars and that this difference may be regarded as a strong proof of the difference of their origins As the obligation of promises is an invention for the interest of society 'tis warp'd into as many different forms as that interest requires and even runs into direct contradictions rather than lose sight of its object But as those other monstrous doctrines are mere priestly inventions and have no public interest in view they are less disturb'd in their progress by new obstacles and it must be own'd that after the first absurdity they follow more directly the current of reason and good sense Theologians clearly perceiv'd that the external form of words being mere sound require an intention to make them have any efficacy and that this intention being once consider'd as a requisite circumstance its absence must equally prevent the  effect whether avow'd or conceal'd whether sincere or deceitful Accordingly they have commonly determin'd that the intention of the priest makes the sacrament and that when he secretly withdraws his intention he is highly criminal in himself but still destroys the baptism or communion or holy orders The terrible consequences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its taking place as the inconvenience of a similar doctrine with regard to promises have prevented that doctrine from establishing itself Men are always more concern'd about the present life than the future and are apt to think the smallest evil which regards the former more important than the greatest which regards the latter  WE may draw the same conclusion concerning the origin of promises from the  force  which is suppos'd to invalidate all contracts and to free us from their obligation Such a principle is a proof that promises have no natural obligation and are mere artificial contrivances for the convenience and advantage of society If we consider aright of the matter force is not essentially different from any other motive of hope or fear which may induce us to engage our word and lay ourselves under any obligation  A man dangerously wounded who promises a competent sum to a surgeon to cure him wou'd certainly be bound to performance tho' the case be not so much different from that of one who promises a sum to a robber as to produce so great a difference in our sentiments of morality if these sentiments were not built entirely on public interest and convenience  SECT VI  Some farther reflections concerning justice and injustice  WE have now run over the three fundamental laws of nature  that of the stability of possession of its transference by consent  and  of the performance of promises  'Tis on the strict observance of those three laws that the peace and security of human society entirely depend nor is there any possibility of establishing a good correspondence among men where these are neglected Society is absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of men and these are as necessary to the support of society Whatever restraint they may impose on the passions of men they are the real offspring of  those passions and are only a more artful and more refin'd way of satisfying them Nothing is more vigilant and inventive than our passions and nothing is more obvious than the convention for the observance of these rules Nature has therefore trusted this affair entirely to the conduct of men and has not plac'd in the mind any peculiar original principles to determine us to a set of actions into which the other principles of our frame and constitution were sufficient to lead us And to convince us the more fully of this truth we may here stop a moment and from a review of the preceding reasonings may draw some new arguments to prove that those laws however necessary are entirely artificial and of human invention and consequently that justice is an artificial and not a natural virtue  I THE first argument I shall make use of is deriv'd from the vulgar definition of justice Justice is commonly defin'd to be  a constant and perpetual will of giving every one his due  In this definition 'tis suppos'd that there are such things as right and property independent of justice and antecedent to it and that they wou'd have subsisted tho' men had never dreamt of practising  such a virtue I have already observ'd in a cursory manner the fallacy of this opinion and shall here continue to open up a little more distinctly my sentiments on that subject  I SHALL begin with observing that this quality which we call  property  is like many of the imaginary qualities of the  peripatetic  philosophy and vanishes upon a more accurate inspection into the subject when consider'd apart from our moral sentiments 'Tis evident property does not consist in any of the sensible qualities of the object For these may continue invariably the same while the property changes Property therefore must consist in some relation of the object But 'tis not in its relation with regard to other external and inanimate objects For these may also continue invariably the same while the property changes This quality therefore consists in the relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings But 'tis not the external and corporeal relation which forms the essence of property For that relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects or with regard to brute creatures tho' in those cases it forms no property 'Tis therefore in some internal relation that the property consists that is  in some influence which the external relations of the object have on the mind and actions Thus the external relation which we call  occupation  or first possession is not of itself imagin'd to be the property of the object but only to cause its property Now 'tis evident this external relation causes nothing in external objects and has only an influence on the mind by giving us a sense of duty in abstaining from that object and in restoring it to the first possessor These actions are properly what we call  justice  and consequently 'tis on that virtue that the nature of property depends and not the virtue on the property  IF any one therefore wou'd assert that justice is a natural virtue and injustice a natural vice he must assert that abstracting from the notions of  property  and  right  and  obligation  a certain conduct and train of actions in certain external relations of objects has naturally a moral beauty or deformity and causes an original pleasure or uneasiness Thus the restoring a man's goods to him is consider'd as virtuous not because nature has annex'd a certain sentiment of pleasure to such a conduct with regard to the property of others but because she has annex'd that sentiment to such a conduct with  regard to those external objects of which others have had the first or long possession or which they have receiv'd by the consent of those who have had first or long possession If nature has given us no such sentiment there is not naturally nor antecedent to human conventions any such thing as property Now tho' it seems sufficiently evident in this dry and accurate consideration of the present subject that nature has annex'd no pleasure or sentiment of approbation to such a conduct yet that I may leave as little room for doubt as possible I shall subjoin a few more arguments to confirm my opinion  First  If nature had given us a pleasure of this kind it wou'd have been as evident and discernible as on every other occasion nor shou'd we have found any difficulty to perceive that the consideration of such actions in such a situation gives a certain pleasure and sentiment of approbation We shou'd not have been oblig'd to have recourse to notions of property in the definition of justice and at the same time make use of the notions of justice in the definition of property This deceitful method of reasoning is a plain proof that there are contain'd in the subject some obscurities and difficulties  which we are not able to surmount and which we desire to evade by this artifice  Secondly  Those rules by which properties rights and obligations are determin'd have in them no marks of a natural origin but many of artifice and contrivance They are too numerous to have proceeded from nature They are changeable by human laws And have all of them a direct and evident tendency to public good and the support of civil society This last circumstance is remarkable upon two accounts  First  because tho' the cause of the establishment of these laws had been a  regard  for the public good as much as the public good is their natural tendency they wou'd still have been artificial as being purposely contriv'd and directed to a certain end  Secondly  because if men had been endow'd with such a strong regard for public good they wou'd never have restrain'd themselves by these rules so that the laws of justice arise from natural principles in a manner still more oblique and artificial 'Tis selflove which is their real origin and as the selflove of one person is naturally contrary to that of another these several interested passions are oblig'd to adjust themselves after such a manner as to concur in some system  of conduct and behaviour This system therefore comprehending the interest of each individual is of course advantageous to the public tho' it be not intended for that purpose by the inventors  II IN the second place we may observe that all kinds of vice and virtue run insensibly into each other and may approach by such imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult if not absolutely impossible to determine when the one ends and the other begins and from this observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing principle For whatever may be the case with regard to all kinds of vice and virtue 'tis certain that rights and obligations and property admit of no such insensible gradation but that a man either has a full and perfect property or none at all and is either entirely oblig'd to perform any action or lies under no manner of obligation However civil laws may talk of a perfect  dominion  and of an imperfect 'tis easy to observe that this arises from a fiction which has no foundation in reason and can never enter into our notions of natural justice and equity A man that hires a horse tho' but for a day has as full a right to  make use of it for that time as he whom we call its proprietor has to make use of it any other day and 'tis evident that however the use may be bounded in time or degree the right itself is not susceptible of any such gradation but is absolute and entire so far as it extends Accordingly we may observe that this right both arises and perishes in an instant and that a man entirely acquires the property of any object by occupation or the consent of the proprietor and loses it by his own consent without any of that insensible gradation which is remarkable in other qualities and relations Since therefore this is the case with regard to property and rights and obligations I ask how it stands with regard to justice and injustice After whatever manner you answer this question you run into inextricable difficulties If you reply that justice and injustice admit of degree and run insensibly into each other you expressly contradict the foregoing position that obligation and property are not susceptible of such a gradation These depend entirely upon justice and injustice and follow them in all their variations Where the justice is entire the property is also entire Where the justice is imperfect the property must also be imperfect  And  vice versa  if the property admit of no such variations they must also be incompatible with justice If you assent therefore to this last proposition and assert that justice and injustice are not susceptible of degrees you in effect assert that they are not  naturally  either vicious or virtuous since vice and virtue moral good and evil and indeed all  natural  qualities run insensibly into each other and are on many occasions undistinguishable  AND here it may be worth while to observe that tho' abstract reasoning and the general maxims of philosophy and law establish this position  that property and right and obligation admit not of degrees  yet in our common and negligent way of thinking we find great difficulty to entertain that opinion and do even  secretly  embrace the contrary principle An object must either be in the possession of one person or another An action must either be perform'd or not The necessity there is of choosing one side in these dilemmas and the impossibility there often is of finding any just medium oblige us when we reflect on the matter to acknowledge that all property and obligations are entire But on the other hand when we consider the origin of property and obligation  and find that they depend on public utility and sometimes on the propensity of the imagination which are seldom entire on any side we are naturally inclin'd to imagine that these moral relations admit of an insensible gradation Hence it is that in references where the consent of the parties leave the referees entire masters of the subject they commonly discover so much equity and justice on both sides as induces them to strike a medium and divide the difference betwixt the parties Civil judges who have not this liberty but are oblig'd to give a decisive sentence on some one side are often at a loss how to determine and are necessitated to proceed on the most frivolous reasons in the world Half rights and obligations which seem so natural in common life are perfect absurdities in their tribunal for which reason they are often oblig'd to take half arguments for whole ones in order to terminate the affair one way or other  III THE third argument of this kind I shall make use of may be explain'd thus If we consider the ordinary course of human actions we shall find that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal rules but acts on most occasions as it is  determin'd by its present motives and inclination As each action is a particular individual event it must proceed from particular principles and from our immediate situation within ourselves and with respect to the rest of the universe If on some occasions we extend our motives beyond those very circumstances which gave rise to them and form something like  general rules  for our conduct 'tis easy to observe that these rules are not perfectly inflexible but allow of many exceptions Since therefore this is the ordinary course of human actions we may conclude that the laws of justice being universal and perfectly inflexible can never be deriv'd from nature nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or inclination No action can be either morally good or evil unless there be some natural passion or motive to impel us to it or deter us from it and 'tis evident that the morality must be susceptible of all the same variations which are natural to the passion Here are two persons who dispute for an estate of whom one is rich a fool and a batchelor the other poor a man of sense and has a numerous family The first is my enemy the second my friend Whether I be actuated in this affair  by a view to public or private interest by friendship or enmity I must be induc'd to do my utmost to procure the estate to the latter Nor wou'd any consideration of the right and property of the persons be able to restrain me were I actuated only by natural motives without any combination or convention with others For as all property depends on morality and as all morality depends on the ordinary course of our passions and actions and as these again are only directed by particular motives 'tis evident such a partial conduct must be suitable to the strictest morality and cou'd never be a violation of property Were men therefore to take the liberty of acting with regard to the laws of society as they do in every other affair they wou'd conduct themselves on most occasions by particular judgments and wou'd take into consideration the characters and circumstances of the persons as well as the general nature of the question But 'tis easy to observe that this wou'd produce an infinite confusion in human society and that the avidity and partiality of men wou'd quickly bring disorder into the world if not restrain'd by some general and inflexible principles 'Twas therefore with a view to this inconvenience  that men have establish'd those principles and have agreed to restrain themselves by general rules which are unchangeable by spite and favour and by particular views of private or public interest These rules then are artificially invented for a certain purpose and are contrary to the common principles of human nature which accommodate themselves to circumstances and have no stated invariable method of operation  NOR do I perceive how I can easily be mistaken in this matter I see evidently that when any man imposes on himself general inflexible rules in his conduct with others he considers certain objects as their property which he supposes to be sacred and inviolable But no proposition can be more evident than that property is perfectly unintelligible without first supposing justice and injustice and that these virtues and vices are as unintelligible unless we have motives independent of the morality to impel us to just actions and deter us from unjust ones Let those motives therefore be what they will they must accommodate themselves to circumstances and must admit of all the variations which human affairs in their incessant revolutions are susceptible of They are consequently a very improper foundation  for such rigid inflexible rules as the laws of nature and 'tis evident these laws can only be deriv'd from human conventions when men have perceiv'd the disorders that result from following their natural and variable principles  UPON the whole then we are to consider this distinction betwixt justice and injustice as having two different foundations  viz  that of  interest  when men observe that 'tis impossible to live in society without restraining themselves by certain rules and that of  morality  when this interest is once observ'd and men receive a pleasure from the view of such actions as tend to the peace of society and an uneasiness from such as are contrary to it 'Tis the voluntary convention and artifice of men which makes the first interest take place and therefore those laws of justice are so far to be consider'd as  artificial  After that interest is once establish'd and acknowledg'd the sense of morality in the observance of these rules follows  naturally  and of itself tho' 'tis certain that it is also augmented by a new  artifice  and that the public instructions of politicians and the private education of parents contribute to the giving a sense of  honour and duty in the strict regulation of our actions with regard to the properties of others  SECT VII  Of the origin of government  NOTHING is more certain than that men are in a great measure govern'd by interest and that even when they extend their concern beyond themselves 'tis not to any great distance nor is it usual for them in common life to look farther than their nearest friends and acquaintance 'Tis no less certain that 'tis impossible for men to consult their interest in so effectual a manner as by an universal and inflexible observance of the rules of justice by which alone they can preserve society and keep themselves from falling into that wretched and savage condition which is commonly represented as the  state of nature  And as this interest which all men have in the upholding of society and the observation of the rules of justice is great so is it palpable and evident even to the most rude and uncultivated of human race and 'tis almost impossible for  any one who has had experience of society to be mistaken in this particular Since therefore men are so sincerely attach'd to their interest and their interest is so much concern'd in the observance of justice and this interest is so certain and avow'd it may be ask'd how any disorder can ever arise in society and what principle there is in human nature so  powerful  as to overcome so strong a passion or so  violent  as to obscure so clear a knowledge  IT has been observ'd in treating of the passions that men are mightily govern'd by the imagination and proportion their affections more to the light under which any object appears to them than to its real and intrinsic value What strikes upon them with a strong and lively idea commonly prevails above what lies in a more obscure light and it must be a great superiority of value that is able to compensate this advantage Now as every thing that is contiguous to us either in space or time strikes upon us with such an idea it has a proportional effect on the will and passions and commonly operates with more force than any object that lies in a more distant and obscure light Tho' we may be fully convinc'd that the latter object excels the former we are not  able to regulate our actions by this judgment but yield to the sollicitations of our passions which always plead in favour of whatever is near and contiguous  THIS is the reason why men so often act in contradiction to their known interest and in particular why they prefer any trivial advantage that is present to the maintenance of order in society which so much depends on the observance of justice The consequences of every breach of equity seem to lie very remote and are not able to counterballance any immediate advantage that may be reap'd from it They are however never the less real for being remote and as all men are in some degree subject to the same weakness it necessarily happens that the violations of equity must become very frequent in society and the commerce of men by that means be render'd very dangerous and uncertain You have the same propension that I have in favour of what is contiguous above what is remote You are therefore naturally carried to commit acts of injustice as well as me Your example both pushes me forward in this way by imitation and also affords me a new reason for any breach of equity by shewing me that I should be the cully of my integrity if I  alone shou'd impose on myself a severe restraint amidst the licentiousness of others  THIS quality therefore of human nature not only is very dangerous to society but also seems on a cursory view to be incapable of any remedy The remedy can only come from the consent of men and if men be incapable of themselves to prefer remote to contiguous they will never consent to any thing which wou'd oblige them to such a choice and contradict in so sensible a manner their natural principles and propensities Whoever chuses the means chuses also the end and if it be impossible for us to prefer what is remote 'tis equally impossible for us to submit to any necessity which wou'd oblige us to such a method of acting  BUT here 'tis observable that this infirmity of human nature becomes a remedy to itself and that we provide against our negligence about remote objects merely because we are naturally inclin'd to that negligence When we consider any objects at a distance all their minute distinctions vanish and we always give the preference to whatever is in itself preferable without considering its situation and circumstances This gives rise to what in an improper sense we  call  reason  which is a principle that is often contradictory to those propensities that display themselves upon the approach of the object In reflecting on any action which I am to perform a twelvemonth hence I always resolve to prefer the greater good whether at that time it will be more contiguous or remote nor does any difference in that particular make a difference in my present intentions and resolutions My distance from the final determination makes all those minute differences vanish nor am I affected by any thing but the general and more discernable qualities of good and evil But on my nearer approach those circumstances which I at first overlook'd begin to appear and have an influence on my conduct and affections A new inclination to the present good springs up and makes it difficult for me to adhere inflexibly to my first purpose and resolution This natural infirmity I may very much regret and I may endeavour by all possible means to free my self from it I may have recourse to study and reflection within myself to the advice of friends to frequent meditation and repeated resolution And having experienc'd how ineffectual all these are I may embrace with pleasure any other expedient by which  I may impose a restraint upon myself and guard against this weakness  THE only difficulty therefore is to find out this expedient by which men cure their natural weakness and lay themselves under the necessity of observing the laws of justice and equity notwithstanding their violent propension to prefer contiguous to remote 'Tis evident such a remedy can never be effectual without correcting this propensity and as 'tis impossible to change or correct any thing material in our nature the utmost we can do is to change our circumstances and situation and render the observance of the laws of justice our nearest interest and their violation our most remote But this being impracticable with respect to all mankind it can only take place with respect to a few whom we thus immediately interest in the execution of justice These are the persons whom we call civil magistrates kings and their ministers our governors and rulers who being indifferent persons to the greatest part of the state have no interest or but a remote one in any act of injustice and being satisfied with their present condition and with their part in society have an immediate interest in every execution of justice which is so necessary to the upholding of  society Here then is the origin of civil government and society Men are not able radically to cure either in themselves or others that narrowness of soul which makes them prefer the present to the remote They cannot change their natures All they can do is to change their situation and render the observance of justice the immediate interest of some particular persons and its violation their more remote These persons then are not only induc'd to observe those rules in their own conduct but also to constrain others to a like regularity and inforce the dictates of equity thro' the whole society And if it be necessary they may also interest others more immediately in the execution of justice and create a number of officers civil and military to assist them in their government  BUT this execution of justice tho' the principal is not the only advantage of government As the violent passions hinders men from seeing distinctly the interest they have in an equitable behaviour towards others so it hinders them from seeing that equity itself and gives them a remarkable partiality in their own favours This inconvenience is corrected in the same manner as that abovemention'd The same persons  who execute the laws of justice will also decide all controversies concerning them and being indifferent to the greatest part of the society will decide them more equitably than every one wou'd in his own case  BY means of these two advantages in the  execution  and  decision  of justice men acquire a security against each others weakness and passion as well as against their own and under the shelter of their governors begin to taste at ease the sweets of society and mutual assistance But government extends farther its beneficial influence and not contented to protect men in those conventions they make for their mutual interest it often obliges them to make such conventions and forces them to seek their own advantage by a concurrence in some common end or purpose There is no quality in human nature which causes more fatal errors in our conduct than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value Two neighbours may agree to drain a meadow which they possess in common because 'tis easy for them to know each others mind and each must perceive that the immediate consequence of his failing in his part is the  abandoning the whole project But 'tis very difficult and indeed impossible that a thousand persons shou'd agree in any such action it being difficult for them to concert so complicated a design and still more difficult for them to execute it while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expence and wou'd lay the whole burden on others Political society easily remedies both these inconveniences Magistrates find an immediate interest in the interest of any considerable part of their subjects They need consult no body but themselves to form any scheme for the promoting of that interest And as the failure of any one piece in the execution is connected tho' not immediately with the failure of the whole they prevent that failure because they find no interest in it either immediate or remote Thus bridges are built harbours open'd ramparts rais'd canals form'd fleets equip'd and armies disciplin'd every where by the care of government which tho' compos'd of men subject to all human infirmities becomes by one of the finest and most subtle inventions imaginable a composition which is in some measure exempted from all these infirmities  SECT VIII  Of the source of allegiance  THOUGH government be an invention very advantageous and even in some circumstances absolutely necessary to mankind it is not necessary in all circumstances nor is it impossible for men to preserve society for some time without having recourse to such an invention Men 'tis true are always much inclin'd to prefer present interest to distant and remote nor is it easy for them to resist the temptation of any advantage that they may immediately enjoy in apprehension of an evil that lies at a distance from them But still this weakness is less conspicuous where the possessions and the pleasures of life are few and of little value as they always are in the infancy of society An  Indian  is but little tempted to dispossess another of his hut or to steal his bow as being already provided of the same advantages and as to any superior fortune which may attend one above another in hunting and fishing 'tis only casual and temporary and will have but small tendency  to disturb society And so far am I from thinking with some philosophers that men are utterly incapable of society without government that I assert the first rudiments of government to arise from quarrels not among men of the same society but among those of different societies A less degree of riches will suffice to this latter effect than is requisite for the former Men fear nothing from public war and violence but the resistance they meet with which because they share it in common seems less terrible and because it comes from strangers seems less pernicious in its consequences than when they are expos'd singly against one whose commerce is advantageous to them and without whose society 'tis impossible they can subsist Now foreign war to a society without government necessarily produces civil war Throw any considerable goods among men they instantly fall a quarrelling while each strives to get possession of what pleases him without regard to the consequences In a foreign war the most considerable of all goods life and limbs are at stake and as every one shuns dangerous ports seizes the best arms seeks excuse for the slightest wounds the laws which may be well enough observ'd while men were calm can  now no longer take place when they are in such commotion  THIS we find verified in the  American  tribes where men live in concord and amity among themselves without any establish'd government and never pay submission to any of their fellows except in time of war when their captain enjoys a shadow of authority which he loses after their return from the field and the establishment of peace with the neighbouring tribes This authority however instructs them in the advantages of government and teaches them to have recourse to it when either by the pillage of war by commerce or by any fortuitous inventions their riches and possessions have become so considerable as to make them forget on every emergence the interest they have in the preservation of peace and justice Hence we may give a plausible reason among others why all governments are at first monarchical without any mixture and variety and why republics arise only from the abuses of monarchy and despotic power Camps are the true mothers of cities and as war cannot be administred by reason of the suddenness of every exigency without some authority in a single person the same kind of authority naturally  takes place in that civil government which succeeds the military And this reason I take to be more natural than the common one deriv'd from patriarchal government or the authority of a father which is said first to take place in one family and to accustom the members of it to the government of a single person The state of society without government is one of the most natural states of men and must subsist with the conjunction of many families and long after the first generation Nothing but an encrease of riches and possessions cou'd oblige men to quit it and so barbarous and uninstructed are all societies on their first formation that many years must elapse before these can encrease to such a degree as to disturb men in the enjoyment of peace and concord  BUT tho' it be possible for men to maintain a small uncultivated society without government 'tis impossible they shou'd maintain a society of any kind without justice and the observance of those three fundamental laws concerning the stability of possession its translation by consent and the performance of promises These are therefore antecedent to government and are suppos'd to impose an obligation before the  duty of allegiance to civil magistrates has once been thought of Nay I shall go farther and assert that government  upon its first establishment  wou'd naturally be suppos'd to derive its obligation from those laws of nature and in particular from that concerning the performance of promises When men have once perceiv'd the necessity of government to maintain peace and execute justice they wou'd naturally assemble together wou'd chuse magistrates determine their power and  promise  them obedience As a promise is suppos'd to be a bond or security already in use and attended with a moral obligation 'tis to be consider'd as the original sanction of government and as the source of the first obligation to obedience This reasoning appears so natural that it has become the foundation of our fashionable system of politics and is in a manner the creed of a party amongst us who pride themselves with reason on the soundness of their philosophy and their liberty of thought  All men  say they  are born free and equal Government and superiority can only be establish'd by consent The consent of men in establishing government imposes on them a new obligation unknown to the laws of nature Men therefore are bound to obey their  magistrates only because they promise it and if they had not given their word either expressly or tacitly to preserve allegiance it would never have become a part of their moral duty  This conclusion however when carried so far as to comprehend government in all its ages and situations is entirely erroneous and I maintain that tho' the duty of allegiance be at first grafted on the obligation of promises and be for some time supported by that obligation yet it quickly takes root of itself and has an original obligation and authority independent of all contracts This is a principle of moment which we must examine with care and attention before we proceed any farther  'TIS reasonable for those philosophers who assert justice to be a natural virtue and antecedent to human conventions to resolve all civil allegiance into the obligation of a promise and assert that 'tis our own consent alone which binds us to any submission to magistracy For as all government is plainly an invention of men and the origin of most governments is known in history 'tis necessary to mount higher in order to find the source of our political duties if we wou'd assert them to have any  natural  obligation of morality These philosophers  therefore quickly observe that society is an antient as the human species and those three fundamental laws of nature as antient as society So that taking advantage of the antiquity and obscure origin of these laws they first deny them to be artificial and voluntary inventions of men and then seek to ingraft on them those other duties which are more plainly artificial But being once undeceiv'd in this particular and having found that  natural  as well as  civil  justice derives its origin from human conventions we shall quickly perceive how fruitless it is to resolve the one into the other and seek in the laws of nature a stronger foundation for our political duties than interest and human conventions while these laws themselves are built on the very same foundation On which ever side we turn this subject we shall find that these two kinds of duty are exactly on the same footing and have the same source both of their  first invention  and  moral obligation  They are contriv'd to remedy like inconveniences and acquire their moral sanction in the same manner from their remedying those inconveniences These are two points which we we shall endeavour to prove as distinctly as possible  WE have already shewn that men  invented  the three fundamental laws of nature when they observ'd the necessity of society to their mutual subsistance and found that 'twas impossible to maintain any correspondence together without some restraint on their natural appetites The same selflove therefore which renders men so incommodious to each other taking a new and more convenient direction produces the rules of justice and is the  first  motive of their observance But when men have observ'd that tho' the rules of justice be sufficient to maintain any society yet 'tis impossible for them of themselves to observe those rules in large and polish'd societies they establish government as a new invention to attain their ends and preserve the old or procure new advantages by a more strict execution of justice So far therefore our  civil  duties are connected with our  natural  that the former are invented chiefly for the sake of the latter and that the principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature In this respect however that law of nature concerning the performance of promises is only compriz'd along with the rest and its exact observance is to be consider'd as an effect of the institution  of government and not the obedience to government as an effect of the obligation of a promise Tho' the object of our civil duties be the enforcing of our natural yet the  First in time not in dignity or force  first  motive of the invention as well as performance of both is nothing but selfinterest And since there is a separate interest in the obedience to government from that in the performance of promises we must also allow of a separate obligation To obey the civil magistrate is requisite to preserve order and concord in society To perform promises is requisite to beget mutual trust and confidence in the common offices of life The ends as well as the means are perfectly distinct nor is the one subordinate to the other  TO make this more evident let us consider that men will often bind themselves by promises to the performance of what it wou'd have been their interest to perform independent of these promises as when they wou'd give others a fuller security by superadding a new obligation of interest to that which they formerly lay under The interest in the performance of promises besides its moral obligation is general avow'd and of the last consequence in life Other  interests may be more particular and doubtful and we are apt to entertain a greater suspicion that men may indulge their humour or passion in acting contrary to them Here therefore promises come naturally in play and are often requir'd for fuller satisfaction and security But supposing those other interests to be as general and avow'd as the interest in the performance of a promise they will be regarded as on the same footing and men will begin to repose the same confidence in them Now this is exactly the case with regard to our civil duties or obedience to the magistrate without which no government cou'd subsist nor any peace or order be maintain'd in large societies where there are so many possessions on the one hand and so many wants real or imaginary on the other Our civil duties therefore must soon detach themselves from our promises and acquire a separate force and influence The interest in both is of the very same kind 'Tis general avow'd and prevails in all times and places There is then no pretext of reason for founding the one upon the other while each of them has a foundation peculiar to itself We might as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the possessions of others into  the obligation of a promise as that of allegiance The interests are not more distinct in the one case than the other A regard to property is not more necessary to natural society than obedience is to civil society or government nor is the former society more necessary to the being of mankind than the latter to their wellbeing and happiness In short if the performance of promises be advantageous so is obedience to government If the former interest be general so is the latter If the one interest be obvious and avow'd so is the other And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of interest each of them must have a peculiar authority independent of the other  BUT 'tis not only the  natural  obligations of interest which are distinct in promises and allegiance but also the  moral  obligations of honour and conscience Nor does the merit or demerit of the one depend in the least upon that of the other And indeed if we consider the close connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations we shall find this conclusion to be entirely unavoidable Our interest is always engag'd on the side of obedience to magistracy and there is nothing but a great present advantage that can lead us to rebellion  by making us overlook the remote interest which we have in the preserving of peace and order in society But tho' a present interest may thus blind us with regard to our own actions it takes not place with regard to those of others nor hinders them from appearing in their true colours as highly prejudicial to public interest and to our own in particular This naturally gives us an uneasiness in considering such seditious and disloyal actions and makes us attach to them the idea of vice and moral deformity 'Tis the same principle which causes us to disapprove of all kinds of private injustice and in particular of the breach of promises We blame all treachery and breach of faith because we consider that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity with regard to promises We blame all disloyalty to magistrates because we perceive that the execution of justice in the stability of possession its translation by consent and the performance of promises is impossible without submission to government As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each other they must give rise to two moral obligations equally separate and independant Tho' there was no such thing as a promise in the world government  wou'd still be necessary in all large and civiliz'd societies and if promises had only their own proper obligation without the separate sanction of government they wou'd have but little efficacy in such societies This separates the boundaries of our public and private duties and shews that the latter are more dependant on the former than the former on the latter  Education  and  the artifice of politicians  concur to bestow a farther morality on loyalty and to brand all rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy Nor is it a wonder that politicians shou'd be very industrious in inculcating such notions where their interest is so particularly concern'd  LEST those arguments shou'd not appear entirely conclusive as I think they are I shall have recourse to authority and shall prove from the universal consent of mankind that the obligation of submission to government is not deriv'd from any promise of the subjects Nor need any one wonder that tho' I have all along endeavour'd to establish my system on pure reason and have scarce ever cited the judgment even of philosophers or historians on any article I shou'd now appeal to popular authority and oppose the sentiments of the rabble to any philosophical  reasoning But it must be observ'd that the opinions of men in this case carry with them a peculiar authority and are in a great measure infallible The distinction of moral good and evil is founded on the pleasure or pain which results from the view of any sentiment or character and as that pleasure or pain cannot be unknown to the person who feels it it follows  This proposition must hold strictly true with regard to every quality that is determin'd merely by sentiment In what sense we can talk either of a  right  or a  wrong  taste in morals eloquence or beauty shall be consider'd afterwards In the mean time it may be observ'd that there is such an uniformity in the  general  sentiments of mankind as to render such questions of but small importance  that there is just so much vice or virtue in any character as every one places in it and that 'tis impossible in this particular we can ever be mistaken And tho' our judgments concerning the  origin  of any vice or virtue be not so certain as those concerning their  degrees  yet since the question in this case regards not any philosophical origin of an obligation but a plain matter of fact 'tis not easily conceiv'd how we can fall into an error A man who acknowledges himself to be bound to another for a certain sum must certainly know whether it be by his own bond or that of his father whether it be of his mere goodwill or for money lent  him and under what conditions and for what purposes he has bound himself In like manner it being certain that there is a moral obligation to submit to government because every one thinks so it must be as certain that this obligation arises not from a promise since no one whose judgment has not been led astray by too strict adherence to a system of philosophy has ever yet dreamt of ascribing it to that origin Neither magistrates nor subjects have form'd this idea of our civil duties  WE find that magistrates are so far from deriving their authority and the obligation to obedience in their subjects from the foundation of a promise or original contract that they conceal as far as possible from their people especially from the vulgar that they have their origin from thence Were this the sanction of government our rulers wou'd never receive it tacitly which is the utmost that can be pretended since what is given tacitly and insensibly can never have such influence on mankind as what is perform'd expressly and openly A tacit promise is where the will is signified by other more diffuse signs than those of speech but a will there must certainly be in the case and that can never escape the person's notice  who exerted it however silent or tacit But were you to ask the far greatest part of the nation whether they had ever consented to the authority of their rulers or promis'd to obey them they wou'd be inclin'd to think very strangely of you and wou'd certainly reply that the affair depended not on their consent but that they were born to such an obedience In consequence of this opinion we frequently see them imagine such persons to be their natural rulers as are at that time depriv'd of all power and authority and whom no man however foolish wou'd voluntarily chuse and this merely because they are in that line which rul'd before and in that degree of it which us'd to succeed tho' perhaps in so distant a period that scarce any man alive cou'd ever have given any promise of obedience Has a government then no authority over such as these because they never consented to it and wou'd esteem the very attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety We find by experience that it punishes them very freely for what it calls treason and rebellion which it seems according to this system reduces itself to common injustice If you say that by dwelling in its dominions they in effect consented to  the establish'd government I answer that this can only be where they think the affair depends on their choice which few or none beside those philosophers have ever yet imagin'd It never was pleaded as an excuse for a rebel that the first act he perform'd after he came to years of discretion was to levy war against the sovereign of the state and that while he was a child he cou'd not bind himself by his own consent and having become a man show'd plainly by the first act he perform'd that he had no design to impose on himself any obligation to obedience We find on the contrary that civil laws punish this crime at the same age as any other which is criminal of itself without our consent that is when the person is come to the full use of reason Whereas to this crime it ought in justice to allow some intermediate time in which a tacit consent at least might be suppos'd To which we may add that a man living under an absolute government wou'd owe it no allegiance since by its very nature it depends not on consent But as that is as  natural  and  common  a government as any it must certainly occasion some obligation and 'tis plain from experience that men who are subjected to it do always think  so This is a clear proof that we do not commonly esteem our allegiance to be deriv'd from our consent or promise and a farther proof is that when our promise is upon any account expressly engag'd we always distinguish exactly betwixt the two obligations and believe the one to add more force to the other than in a repetition of the same promise Where no promise is given a man looks not on his faith as broken in private matters upon account of rebellion but keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly distinct and separate As the uniting of them was thought by these philosophers a very subtle invention this is a convincing proof that 'tis not a true one since no man can either give a promise or be restrain'd by its sanction and obligation unknown to himself  SECT IX  Of the measures of allegiance  THOSE political writers who have had recourse to a promise or original contract as the source of our allegiance to government intended to establish a principle which is perfectly just and reasonable  tho' the reasoning upon which they endeavour'd to establish it was fallacious and sophistical They wou'd prove that our submission to government admits of exceptions and that an egregious tyranny in the rulers is sufficient to free the subjects from all ties of allegiance Since men enter into society say they and submit themselves to government by their free and voluntary consent they must have in view certain advantages which they propose to reap from it and for which they are contented to resign their native liberty There is therefore something mutual engag'd on the part of the magistrate  viz  protection and security and 'tis only by the hopes he affords of these advantages that he can ever persuade men to submit to him But when instead of protection and security they meet with tyranny and oppression they are free'd from their promises as happens in all conditional contracts and return to that state of liberty which preceded the institution of government Men wou'd never be so foolish as to enter into such engagements as shou'd turn entirely to the advantage of others without any view of bettering their own condition Whoever proposes to draw any profit from our submission must engage himself either  expresly or tacitly to make us reap some advantage from his authority nor ought he to expect that without the performance of his part we will ever continue in obedience  I REPEAT it This conclusion is just tho' the principles be erroneous and I flatter myself that I can establish the same conclusion on more reasonable principles I shall not take such a compass in establishing our political duties as to assert that men perceive the advantages of government that they institute government with a view to those advantages that this institution requires a promise of obedience which imposes a moral obligation to a certain degree but being conditional ceases to be binding whenever the other contracting party performs not his part of the engagement I perceive that a promise itself arises entirely from human conventions and is invented with a view to a certain interest I seek therefore some such interest more immediately connected with government and which may be at once the original motive to its institution and the source of our obedience to it This interest I find to consist in the security and protection which we enjoy in political society and which we can never attain when perfectly free and independent  As the interest therefore is the immediate sanction of government the one can have no longer being than the other and whenever the civil magistrate carries his oppression so far as to render his authority perfectly intolerable we are no longer bound to submit to it The cause ceases the effect must cease also  SO far the conclusion is immediate and direct concerning the  natural  obligation which we have to allegiance As to the  moral  obligation we may observe that the maxim wou'd here be false that  when the cause ceases the effect must cease also  For there is a principle of human nature which we have frequently taken notice of that men are mightily addicted to  general rules  and that we often carry our maxims beyond those reasons which first induc'd us to establish them Where cases are similar in many circumstances we are apt to put them on the same footing without considering that they differ in the most material circumstances and that the resemblance is more apparent than real It may therefore be thought that in the case of allegiance our moral obligation of duty will not cease even tho' the natural obligation of interest which is its cause has ceas'd and  that men may be bound by  conscience  to submit to a tyrannical government against their own and the public interest And indeed to the force of this argument I so far submit as to acknowledge that general rules commonly extend beyond the principles on which they are founded and that we seldom make any exception to them unless that exception have the qualities of a general rule and be founded on very numerous and common instances Now this I assert to be entirely the present case When men submit to the authority of others 'tis to procure themselves some security against the wickedness and injustice of men who are perpetually carried by their unruly passions and by their present and immediate interest to the violation of all the laws of society But as this imperfection is inherent in human nature we know that it must attend men in all their states and conditions and that those whom we chuse for rulers do not immediately become of a superior nature to the rest of mankind upon account of their superior power and authority What we expect from them depends not on a change of their nature but of their situation when they acquire a more immediate interest in the preservation of order and the  execution of justice But besides that this interest is only more immediate in the execution of justice among their subjects besides this I say we may often expect from the irregularity of human nature that they will neglect even this immediate interest and be transported by their passions into all the excesses of cruelty and ambition Our general knowledge of human nature our observation of the past history of mankind our experience of present times all these causes must induce us to open the door to exceptions and must make us conclude that we may resist the more violent effects of supreme power without any crime or injustice  ACCORDINGLY we may observe that this is both the general practice and principle of mankind and that no nation that cou'd find any remedy ever yet suffer'd the cruel ravages of a tyrant or were blam'd for their resistance Those who took up arms against  Dionysius  or  Nero  or  Philip the second  have the favour of every reader in the perusal of their history and nothing but the most violent perversion of common sense can ever lead us to condemn them 'Tis certain therefore that in all our notions of morals we never entertain such an absurdity as that  of passive obedience but make allowances for resistance in the more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression The general opinion of mankind has some authority in all cases but in this of morals 'tis perfectly infallible Nor is it less infallible because men cannot distinctly explain the principles on which it is founded Few persons can carry on this train of reasoning  "Government is a mere human invention for the interest of society Where the tyranny of the governor removes this interest it also removes the natural obligation to obedience The moral obligation is founded on the natural and therefore must cease where  that  ceases especially where the subject is such as makes us foresee very many occasions wherein the natural obligation may cease and causes us to form a kind of general rule for the regulation of our conduct in such occurrences"  But tho' this train of reasoning be too subtile for the vulgar 'tis certain that all men have an implicit notion of it and are sensible that they owe obedience to government merely on account of the public interest and at the same time that human nature is so subject to frailties and passions as may easily pervert this institution and change  their governors into tyrants and public enemies If the sense of public interest were not our original motive to obedience I wou'd fain ask what other principle is there in human nature capable of subduing the natural ambition of men and forcing them to such a submission Imitation and custom are not sufficient For the question still recurs what motive first produces those instances of submission which we imitate and that train of actions which produces the custom There evidently is no other principle than public interest and if interest first produces obedience to government the obligation to obedience must cease whenever the interest ceases in any great degree and in a considerable number of instances  SECT X  Of the objects of allegiance  BUT tho' on some occasions it may be justifiable both in sound politics and morality to resist supreme power 'tis certain that in the ordinary course of human affairs nothing can be more pernicious and criminal and that besides the convulsions  which always attend revolutions such a practice tends directly to the subversion of all government and the causing an universal anarchy and confusion among mankind As numerous and civiliz'd societies cannot subsist without government so government is entirely useless without an exact obedience We ought always to weigh the advantages which we reap from authority against the disadvantages and by this means we shall become more scrupulous of putting in practice the doctrine of resistance The common rule requires submission and 'tis only in cases of grievous tyranny and oppression that the exception can take place  SINCE then such a blind submission is commonly due to magistracy the next question is  to whom it is due and whom we are to regard as our lawful magistrates  In order to answer this question let us recollect what we have already establish'd concerning the origin of government and political society When men have once experienc'd the impossibility of preserving any steady order in society while every one is his own master and violates or observes the laws of interest according to his present interest or pleasure they naturally run into the invention of government and put it out of  their own power as far as possible to transgress the laws of society Government therefore arises from the voluntary convention of men and 'tis evident that the same convention which establishes government will also determine the persons who are to govern and will remove all doubt and ambiguity in this particular And the voluntary consent of men must here have the greater efficacy that the authority of the magistrate does  at first  stand upon the foundation of a promise of the subjects by which they bind themselves to obedience as in every other contract or engagement The same promise then which binds them to obedience ties them down to a particular person and makes him the object of their allegiance  BUT when government has been estabish'd on this footing for some considerable time and the separate interest which we have in submission has produc'd a separate sentiment of morality the case is entirely alter'd and a promise is no longer able to determine the particular magistrate since it is no longer consider'd as the foundation of government We naturally suppose ourselves born to submission and imagine that such particular persons have a right to command  as we on our part are bound to obey These notions of right and obligation are deriv'd from nothing but the  advantage  we reapt from government which gives us a repugnance to practise resistance ourselves and makes us displeas'd with any instance of it in others But here 'tis remarkable that in this new state of affairs the original sanction of government which is  interest  is not admitted to determine the persons whom we are to obey as the original sanction did at first when affairs were on the footing of a  promise  A  promise  fixes and determines the persons without any uncertainty But 'tis evident that if men were to regulate their conduct in this particular by the view of a peculiar  interest  either public or private they wou'd involve themselves in endless confusion and wou'd render all government in a great measure ineffectual The private interest of every one is different and tho' the public interest in itself be always one and the same yet it becomes the source of as great dissentions by reason of the different opinions of particular persons concerning it The same interest therefore which causes us to submit to magistracy makes us renounce itself in the choice of our magistrates and binds us  down to a certain form of government and to particular persons without allowing us to aspire to the utmost perfection in either The case is here the same as in that law of nature concerning the stability of possession 'Tis highly advantageous and even absolutely necessary to society that possession shou'd be stable and this leads us to the establishment of such a rule But we find that were we to follow the same advantage in assigning particular possessions to particular persons we shou'd disappoint our end and perpetuate the confusion which that rule is intended to prevent We must therefore proceed by general rules and regulate ourselves by general interests in modifying the law of nature concerning the stability of possession Nor need we fear that our attachment to this law will diminish upon account of the seeming frivolousness of those interests by which it is determin'd The impulse of the mind is deriv'd from a very strong interest and those other more minute interests serve only to direct the motion without adding any thing to it or diminishing from it 'Tis the same case with government Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an invention and this interest is sufficient to make us embrace  it with ardour and alacrity tho' we are oblig'd afterwards to regulate and direct our devotion to government by several considerations which are not of the same importance and to chuse our magistrates without having in view any particular advantage from the choice  THE  first  of those principles I shall take notice of as a foundation of the right of magistracy is that which gives authority to all the most establish'd governments of the world without exception I mean  long possession  in any one form of government or succession of princes 'Tis certain that if we remount to the first origin of every nation we shall find that there scarce is any race of kings or form of a commonwealth that is not primarily founded on usurpation and rebellion and whose title is not at first worse than doubtful and uncertain Time alone gives solidity to their right and operating gradually on the minds of men reconciles them to any authority and makes it seem just and reasonable Nothing causes any sentiment to have a greater influence upon us than custom or turns our imagination more strongly to any object When we have been long accustom'd to obey any set of men that general instinct or tendency  which we have to suppose a moral obligation attending loyalty takes easily this direction and chuses that set of men for its objects 'Tis interest which gives the general instinct but 'tis custom which gives the particular direction  AND here 'tis observable that the same length of time has a different influence on our sentiments of morality according to its different influence on the mind We naturally judge of every thing by comparison and since in considering the fate of kingdoms and republics we embrace a long extent of time a small duration has not in this case a like influence on our sentiments as when we consider any other object One thinks he acquires a right to a horse or a suit of cloaths in a very short time but a century is scarce sufficient to establish any new government or remove all scruples in the minds of the subjects concerning it Add to this that a shorter period of time will suffice to give a prince a title to any additional power he may usurp than will serve to fix his right where the whole is an usurpation The kings of  France  have not been possess'd of absolute power for above two reigns and yet nothing will appear more extravagant to  Frenchmen  than to talk  of their liberties If we consider what has been said concerning  accession  we shall easily account for this phaenomenon  WHEN there is no form of government establish'd by  long  possession the  present  possession is sufficient to supply its place and may be regarded as the  second  source of all public authority Right to authority is nothing but the constant possession of authority maintain'd by the laws of society and the interests of mankind and nothing can be more natural than to join this constant possession to the present one according to the principles abovemention'd If the same principles did not take place with regard to the property of private persons 'twas because these principles were counterballanc'd by very strong considerations of interest when we observ'd that all restitution wou'd by that means be prevented and every violence be authoriz'd and protected And tho' the same motives may seem to have force with regard to public authority yet they are oppos'd by a contrary interest which consists in the preservation of peace and the avoiding of all changes which however they may be easily produc'd in private affairs are unavoidably attended with bloodshed  and confusion where the public is interested  ANY one who finding the impossibility of accounting for the right of the present possessor by any receiv'd system of ethics shou'd resolve to deny absolutely that right and assert that it is not authoriz'd by morality wou'd be justly thought to maintain a very extravagant paradox and to shock the common sense and judgment of mankind No maxim is more conformable both to prudence and morals than to submit quietly to the government which we find establish'd in the country where we happen to live without enquiring too curiously into its origin and first establishment Few governments will bear being examin'd so rigorously How many kingdoms are there at present in the world and how many more do we find in history whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession To confine ourselves to the  Roman  and  Grecian  empire is it not evident that the long succession of emperors from the dissolution of the  Roman  liberty to the final extinction of that empire by the  Turks  cou'd not so much as pretend to any other title to the empire The election of the senate was a mere form which always  follow'd the choice of the legions and these were almost always divided in the different provinces and nothing but the sword was able to terminate the difference 'Twas by the sword therefore that every emperor acquir'd as well as defended his right and we must either say that all the known world for so many ages had no government and ow'd no allegiance to any one or must allow that the right of the stronger in public affairs is to be receiv'd as legitimate and authoriz'd by morality when not oppos'd by any other title  THE right of  conquest  may be consider'd as a  third  source of the title of sovereigns This right resembles very much that of present possession but has rather a superior force being seconded by the notions of glory and honour which we ascribe to  conquerors  instead of the sentiments of hatred and detestation which attend  usurpers  Men naturally favour those they love and therefore are more apt to ascribe a right to successful violence betwixt one soverign and another than to the successful rebellion of a subject against his sovereign  It is not here asserted that  present possession  or  conquest  are sufficient to give a title against  long possession  and  positive laws  But only that they have some force and will be able to cast the ballance where the titles are otherwise equal and will even be sufficient  sometimes  to sanctify the weaker title What degree of force they have is difficult to determine I believe all moderate men will allow that they have great force in all disputes concerning the rights of princes    WHEN neither long possession nor present possession nor conquest take place as when the first sovereign who founded any monarchy dies in that case the right of  succession  naturally prevails in their stead and men are commonly induc'd to place the son of their late monarch on the throne and suppose him to inherit his father's authority The presum'd consent of the father the imitation of the succession to private families the interest which the state has in chusing the person who is most powerful and has the most numerous followers all these reasons lead men to prefer the son of their late monarch to any other person  To prevent mistakes I must observe that this case of succession is not the same with that of hereditary monarchies where custom has fix'd the right of succession These depend upon the principle of long possession above explain'd    THESE reasons have some weight but I am persuaded that to one who considers impartially of the matter 'twill appear that there concur some principles of the imagination along with those views of interest The royal authority seems to be connected with the young prince even in his father's  lifetime by the natural transition of the thought and still more after his death So that nothing is more natural than to compleat this union by a new relation and by putting him actually in possession of what seems so naturally to belong to him  To confirm this we may weigh the following phaenomena which are pretty curious in their kind In elective monarchies the right of succession has no place by the laws and settled custom and yet its influence is so natural that 'tis impossible entirely to exclude it from the imagination and render the subjects indifferent to the son of their deceas'd monarch Hence in some governments of this kind the choice commonly falls on one or other of the royal family and in some governments they are all excluded Those contrary phaenomena proceed from the same principle Where the royal family is excluded 'tis from a refinement in politics which makes people sensible of their propensity to chuse a sovereign in that family and gives them a jealousy of their liberty lest their new monarch aided by this propensity shou'd establish his family and destroy the freedom of elections for the future  THE history of  Artaxerxes  and the younger  Cyrus  may furnish us with some reflections to the same purpose  Cyrus  pretended a right to the throne above his elder brother because he was born after his father's accession I do not pretend that this reason was valid I wou'd only infer from it that he wou'd never have made use of such a pretext were it not for the qualities of the imagination abovemention'd by which we are naturally inclin'd to unite by a new relation whatever objects we find already united  Artaxerxes  had an advantage above his brother as being the eldest son and the first in succession But  Cyrus  was more closely related to the royal authority as being begot after his father was invested with it  SHOU'D it here be pretended that the view of convenience may be the source of all the right of succession and that men gladly take advantage of any rule by which they can fix the successor of their late sovereign and prevent that anarchy and confusion which attends all new elections To this I wou'd answer that I readily allow that this motive may contribute something to the effect but at the same time I assert that without another principle 'tis impossible  such a motive shou'd take place The interest of a nation requires that the succession to the crown shou'd be fix'd one way or other but 'tis the same thing to its interest in what way it be fix'd So that if the relation of blood had not an effect independent of public interest it wou'd never have been regarded without a positive law and 'twou'd have been impossible that so many positive laws of different nations cou'd ever have concur'd precisely in the same views and intentions  THIS leads us to consider the  fifth  source of authority viz  positive laws  when the legislature establishes a certain form of government and succession of princes At first sight it may be thought that this must resolve into some of the preceding titles of authority The legislative power whence the positive law is deriv'd must either be establish'd by original contract long possession present possession conquest or succession and consequently the positive law must derive its force from some of those principles But here 'tis remarkable that tho' a positive law can only derive its force from these principles yet it acquires not all the force of the principle from whence it is deriv'd but loses considerably in the transition  as it is natural to imagine For instance a government is establish'd for many centuries on a certain system of laws forms and methods of succession The legislative power establish'd by this long succession changes all on a sudden the whole system of government and introduces a new constitution in its stead I believe few of the subjects will think themselves bound to comply with this alteration unless it have an evident tendency to the public good But will think themselves still at liberty to return to the antient government Hence the notion of  fundamental laws  which are suppos'd to be inalterable by the will of the sovereign And of this nature the  Salic  law is understood to be in  France  How far these fundamental laws extend is not determind'd in any government nor is it possible it ever shou'd There is such an insensible gradation from the most material laws to the most trivial and from the most antient laws to the most modern that 'twill be impossible to set bounds to the legislative power and determine how far it may innovate in the principles of government That is the work more of imagination and passion than of reason  WHOEVER considers the history of the several nations of the world their revolutions conquests increase and diminution the manner in which their particular governments are establish'd and the successive right transmitted from one person to another will soon learn to treat very lightly all disputes concerning the rights of princes and will be convinc'd that a strict adherence to any general rules and the rigid loyalty to particular persons and families on which some people set so high a value are virtues that hold less of reason than of bigotry and superstition In this particular the study of history confirms the reasonings of true philosophy which shewing us the original qualities of human nature teaches us to regard the controversies in politics as incapable of any decision in most cases and as entirely subordinate to the interests of peace and liberty Where the public good does not evidently demand a change 'tis certain that the concurrence of all those titles  original contract long possession present possession succession  and  positive laws  forms the strongest title to sovereignty and is justly regarded as sacred and inviolable But when these titles are mingled and oppos'd in different degrees  they often occasion perplexity and are less capable of solution from the arguments of lawyers and philosophers than from the swords of the soldiery Who shall tell me for instance whether  Germanicus  or  Drusus  ought to have succeeded  Tiberius  had he died while they were both alive without naming any of them for his successor Ought the right of adoption to be receiv'd as equivalent to that of blood in a nation where it had the same effect in private families and had already in two instances taken place in the public Ought  Germanicus  to be esteem'd the eldest son because he was born before  Drusus  or the younger because he was adopted after the birth of his brother Ought the right of the elder to be regarded in a nation where the eldest brother had no advantage in the succession to private families Ought the  Roman  empire at that time to be esteem'd hereditary because of two examples or ought it even so early to be regarded as belonging to the stronger or the present possessor as being founded on so recent an usurpation Upon whatever principles we may pretend to answer these and such like questions I am afraid we shall never be able to satisfy an impartial enquirer who adopts no party in political controversies  and will be satisfied with nothing but sound reason and philosophy  BUT here an  English  reader will be apt to enquire concerning that famous  revolution  which has had such a happy influence on our constitution and has been attended with such mighty consequences We have already remark'd that in the case of enormous tyranny and oppression 'tis lawful to take arms even against supreme power and that as government is a mere human invention for mutual advantage and security it no longer imposes any obligation either natural or moral when once it ceases to have that tendency But tho' this  general  principle be authoriz'd by common sense and the practice of all ages 'tis certainly impossible for the laws or even for philosophy to establish any  particular  rules by which we may know when resistance is lawful and decide all controversies which may arise on that subject This may not only happen with regard to supreme power but 'tis possible even in some constitutions where the legislative authority is not lodg'd in one person that there may be a magistrate so eminent and powerful as to oblige the laws to keep silence in this particular  Nor wou'd this silence be an effect only of their  respect  but also of their  prudence  since 'tis certain that in the vast variety of circumstances which occur in all governments an exercise of power in so great a magistrate may at one time be beneficial to the public which at another time wou'd be pernicious and tyrannical But notwithstanding this silence of the laws in limited monarchies 'tis certain that the people still retain the right of resistance since 'tis impossible even in the most despotic governments to deprive them of it The same necessity of selfpreservation and the same motive of public good give them the same liberty in the one case as in the other And we may farther observe that in such mix'd governments the cases wherein resistance is lawful must occur much oftener and greater indulgence be given to the subjects to defend themselves by force of arms than in arbitrary governments Not only where the chief magistrate enters into measures in themselves extremely pernicious to the public but even when he wou'd encroach on the other parts of the constitution and extend his power beyond the legal bounds it is allowable to resist and dethrone him tho' such resistance  and violence may in the general tenor of the laws be deem'd unlawful and rebellious For besides that nothing is more essential to public interest than the preservation of public liberty 'tis evident that if such a mix'd government be once suppos'd to be establish'd every part or member of the constitution must have a right of selfdefence and of maintaining its antient bounds against the encroachment of every other authority As matter wou'd have been created in vain were it depriv'd of a power of resistance without which no part of it cou'd preserve a distinct existence and the whole might becrowded up into a single point So 'tis a gross absurdity to suppose in any government a right without a remedy or allow that the supreme power is shar'd with the people without allowing that 'tis lawful for them to defend their share against every invader Those therefore who wou'd seem to respect our free government and yet deny the right of resistance have renounc'd all pretensions to common sense and do not merit a serious answer  IT does not belong to my present purpose to shew that these general principles are applicable to the late  revolution  and that all the rights and privileges which ought  to be sacred to a free nation were at that time threaten'd with the utmost danger I am better pleas'd to leave this controverted subject if it really admits of controversy and to indulge myself in some philosophical reflections which naturally arise from that important event  First  We may observe that shou'd the  lords  and  commons  in our constitution without any reason from public interest either depose the king in being or after his death exclude the prince who by laws and settled custom ought to succeed no one wou'd esteem their proceedings legal or think themselves bound to comply with them But shou'd the king by his unjust practices or his attempts for a tyrannical and despotic power justly forfeit his legal it then not only becomes morally lawful and suitable to the nature of political society to dethrone him but what is more we are apt likewise to think that the remaining members of the constitution acquire a right of excluding his next heir and of chusing whom they please for his successor This is founded on a very singular quality of our thought and imagination When a king forfeits his authority his heir ought naturally to remain in the same situation as if the king were remov'd  by death unless by mixing himself in the tyranny he forfeit it for himself But tho' this may seem reasonable we easily comply with the contrary opinion The deposition of a king in such a government as ours is certainly an act beyond all common authority and an illegal assuming a power for public good which in the ordinary course of government can belong to no member of the constitution When the public good is so great and so evident as to justify the action the commendable use of this licence causes us naturally to attribute to the  parliament  a right of using farther licences and the antient bounds of the laws being once transgressed with approbation we are not apt to be so strict in confining ourselves precisely within their limits The mind naturally runs on with any train of action which it has begun nor do we commonly make any scruple concerning our duty after the first action of any kind which we perform Thus at the  revolution  no one who thought the deposition of the father justifiable esteem'd themselves to be confin'd to his infant son tho' had that unhappy monarch died innocent at that time and had his son by any accident been convey'd beyond seas there is no doubt but a regency wou'd have  been appointed till he shou'd come to age and cou'd be restor'd to his dominions As the slightest properties of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the people it shews the wisdom of the laws and of the parliament to take advantage of such properties and to chuse the magistrates either in or out of a line according as the vulgar will most naturally attribute authority and right to them  Secondly  Tho' the accession of the  Prince  of  Orange  to the throne might at first give occasion to many disputes and his title be contested it ought not now to appear doubtful but must have acquir'd a sufficient authority from those three princes who have succeeded him upon the same title Nothing is more usual tho' nothing may at first sight appear more unreasonable than this way of thinking Princes often  seem  to acquire a right from their successors as well as from their ancestors and a king who during his lifetime might justly be deem'd an usurper will be regarded by posterity as a lawful prince because he has had the good fortune to settle his family on the throne and entirely change the antient form of government  Julius Caesar  is regarded as the first  Roman  emperor while  Sylla  and  Marius  whose titles were really the same as his are treated as tyrants and usurpers Time and custom give authority to all forms of government and all successions of princes and that power which at first was founded only on injustice and violence becomes in time legal and obligatory Nor does the mind rest there but returning back upon its footsteps transfers to their predecessors and ancestors that right which it naturally ascribes to the posterity as being related together and united in the imagination The present  king  of  France  makes  Hugh Capet  a more lawful prince than  Cromwell  as the establish'd liberty of the  Dutch  is no inconsiderable apology for their obstinate resistance to  Philip  the second  SECT XI  Of the laws of nations  WHEN civil government has been establish'd over the greatest part of mankind and different societies have been form'd contiguous to each other there arises a new set of duties among the neighbouring states suitable to the nature of that commerce which they carry on with each  other Political writers tell us that in every kind of intercourse a body politic is to be consider'd as one person and indeed this assertion is so far just that different nations as well as private persons require mutual assistance at the same time that their selfishness and ambition are perpetual sources of war and discord But tho' nations in this particular resemble individuals yet as they are very different in other respects no wonder they regulate themselves by different maxims and give rise to a new set of rules which we call  the laws of nations  Under this head we may comprize the sacredness of the persons of ambassadors the declaration of war the abstaining from poison'd arms with other duties of that kind which are evidently calculated for the commerce that is peculiar to different societies  BUT tho' these rules be superadded to the laws of nature the former do not entirely abolish the latter and one may safely affirm that the three fundamental rules of justice the stability of possession its transference by consent and the performance of promises are duties of princes as well as of subjects The same interest produces the same effect in both cases Where possession has no stability there must be perpetual  war Where property is not transferr'd by consent there can be no commerce Where promises are not observ'd there can be no leagues nor alliances The advantages therefore of peace commerce and mutual succour make us extend to different kingdoms the same notions of justice which take place among individuals  THERE is a maxim very current in the world which few politicians are willing to avow but which has been authoriz'd by the practice of all ages  that there is a system of morals calculated for princes much more free than that which ought to govern private persons  'Tis evident this is not to be understood of the lesser  extent  of public duties and obligations nor will any one be so extravagant as to assert that the most solemn treaties ought to have no force among princes For as princes do actually form treaties among themselves they must propose some advantage from the execution of them and the prospect of such advantage for the future must engage them to perform their part and must establish that law of nature The meaning therefore of this political maxim is that tho' the morality of princes has the same  extent  yet it has not the same  force  as that of private persons  and may lawfully be transgress'd from a more trivial motive However shocking such a proposition may appear to certain philosophers 'twill be easy to defend it upon those principles by which we have accounted for the origin of justice and equity  WHEN men have found by experience that 'tis impossible to subsist without society and that 'tis impossible to maintain society while they give free course to their appetites so urgent an interest quickly restrains their actions and imposes an obligation to observe those rules which we call  the laws of justice  This obligation of interest rests not here but by the necessary course of the passions and sentiments gives rise to the moral obligation of duty while we approve of such actions as tend to the peace of society and disapprove of such as tend to its disturbance The same  natural  obligation of interest takes place among independent kingdoms and gives rise to the same  morality  so that no one of ever so corrupt morals will approve of a prince who voluntarily and of his own accord breaks his word or violates any treaty But here we may observe that tho' the intercourse of different states be advantageous and even sometimes necessary yet it is not so necessary nor advantageous as  that among individuals without which 'tis utterly impossible for human nature ever to subsist Since therefore the  natural  obligation to justice among different states is not so strong as among individuals the  moral  obligation which arises from it must partake of its weakness and we must necessarily give a greater indulgence to a prince or minister who deceives another than to a private gentleman who breaks his word of honour  SHOU'D it be ask'd  what proportion these two species of morality bear to each other  I wou'd answer that this is a question to which we can never give any precise answer nor is it possible to reduce to numbers the proportion which we ought to fix betwixt them One may safely affirm that this proportion finds itself without any art or study of men as we may observe on many other occasions The practice of the world goes farther in teaching us the degrees of our duty than the most subtile philosophy which was ever yet invented And this may serve as a convincing proof that all men have an implicit notion of the foundation of those moral rules concerning natural and civil justice and are sensible that they arise merely from human conventions and from the interest  which we have in the preservation of peace and order For otherwise the diminution of the interest wou'd never produce a relaxation of the morality and reconcile us more easily to any transgression of justice among princes and republics than in the private commerce of one subject with another  SECT XII  Of chastity and modesty  IF any difficulty attend this system concerning the laws of nature and nations 'twill be with regard to the universal approbation or blame which follows their observance or transgression and which some may not think sufficiently explain'd from the general interests of society To remove as far as possible all scruples of this kind I shall here consider another set of duties  viz  the  modesty  and  chastity  which belong to the fair sex And I doubt not but these virtues will be found to be still more conspicuous instances of the operation of those principles which I have insisted on  THERE are some philosophers who attack the female virtues with great vehemence and fancy they have gone very far in detecting popular errors when they can show that there is no foundation in nature for all that exterior modesty which we require in the expressions and dress and behaviour of the fair sex I believe I may spare myself the trouble of insisting on so obvious a subject and may proceed without farther preparation to examine after what manner such notions arise from education from the voluntary conventions of men and from the interest of society  WHOEVER considers the length and feebleness of human infancy with the concern which both sexes naturally have for their offspring will easily perceive that there must be an union of male and female for the education of the young and that this union must be of considerable duration But in order to induce the men to impose on themselves this restraint and undergo chearfully all the fatigues and expences to which it subjects them they must believe that the children are their own and that their natural instinct is not directed to a wrong object when they give a loose to love and tenderness Now if we examine  the structure of the human body we shall find that this security is very difficult to be attain'd on our part and that since in the copulation of the sexes the principle of generation goes from the man to the woman an error may easily take place on the side of the former tho' it be utterly impossible with regard to the latter From this trivial and anatomical observation is deriv'd that vast difference betwixt the education and duties of the two sexes  WERE a philosopher to examine the matter  a priori  he wou'd reason after the following manner Men are induc'd to labour for the maintenance and education of their children by the persuasion that they are really their own and therefore 'tis reasonable and even necessary to give them some security in this particular This security cannot consist entirely in the imposing of severe punishments on any transgressions of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife since these public punishments cannot be inflicted without legal proof which 'tis difficult to meet with in this subject What restraint therefore shall we impose on women in order to counterbalance so strong a temptation as they have to fidelity There seems to be no restraint possible but in the  punishment of bad fame or reputation a punishment which has a mighty influence on the human mind and at the same time is inflicted by the world upon surmizes and conjectures and proofs that wou'd never be receiv'd in any court of judicature In order therefore to impose a due restraint on the female sex we must attach a peculiar degree of shame to their infidelity above what arises merely from its injustice and must bestow proportionable praises on their chastity  BUT tho' this be a very strong motive to fidelity our philosopher wou'd quickly discover that it wou'd not alone be sufficient to that purpose All human creatures especially of the female sex are apt to overlook remote motives in favour of any present temptation The temptation is here the strongest imaginable Its approaches are insensible and seducing And a woman easily finds or flatters herself she shall find certain means of securing her reputation and preventing all the pernicious consequences of her pleasures 'Tis necessary therefore that beside the infamy attending such licences there shou'd be some preceding backwardness or dread which may prevent their first approaches and may give the female sex a  repugnance to all expressions and postures and liberties that have an immediate relation to that enjoyment  SUCH wou'd be the reasonings of our speculative philosopher But I am persuaded that if he had not a perfect knowledge of human nature he wou'd be apt to regard them as mere chimerical speculations and wou'd consider the infamy attending infidelity and backwardness to all its approaches as principles that were rather to be wish'd than hop'd for in the world For what means wou'd he say of persuading mankind that the transgressions of conjugal duty are more infamous than any other kind of injustice when 'tis evident they are more excusable upon account of the greatness of the temptation And what possibility of giving a backwardness to the approaches of a pleasure to which nature has inspir'd so strong a propensity and a propensity that 'tis absolutely necessary in the end to comply with for the support of the species  BUT speculative reasonings which cost so much pains to philosophers are often form'd by the world naturally and without reflection As difficulties which seem unsurmountable in theory are easily got over in practice Those who have an interest  in the fidelity of women naturally disapprove of their infidelity and all the approaches to it Those who have no interest are carried along with the stream Education takes possession of the ductile minds of the fair sex in their infancy And when a general rule of this kind is once establish'd men are apt to extend it beyond those principles from which it first arose Thus batchelors however debauch'd cannot chuse but be shock'd with any instance of lewdness or impudence in women And tho' all these maxims have a plain reference to generation yet women past childbearing have no more privilege in this respect than those who are in the flower of their youth and beauty Men have undoubtedly an implicit notion that all those ideas of modesty and decency have a regard to generation since they impose not the same laws  with the same force  on the male sex where that reason takes not place The exception is there obvious and extensive and founded on a remarkable difference which produces a clear separation and disjunction of ideas But as the case is not the same with regard to the different ages of women for this reason tho' men know that these notions are founded on the public interest yet the  general rule carries us beyond the original principle and makes us extend the notions of modesty over the whole sex from their earliest infancy to their extremest oldage and infirmity  COURAGE which is the point of honour among men derives its merit in a great measure from artifice as well as the chastity of women tho' it has also some foundation in nature as we shall see afterwards  AS to the obligations which the male sex lie under with regard to chastity we may observe that according to the general notions of the world they bear nearly the same proportion to the obligations of women as the obligations of the law of nations do to those of the law of nature 'Tis contrary to the interest of civil society that men shou'd have an  entire  liberty of indulging their appetites in venereal enjoyment But as this interest is weaker than in the case of the female sex the moral obligation arising from it must be proportionably weaker And to prove this we need only appeal to the practice and sentiments of all nations and ages  PART III  Of the other virtues and vices  SECT I  Of the origin of the natural virtues and vices  WE come now to the examination of such virtues and vices as are entirely natural and have no dependance on the artifice and contrivance of men The examination of these will conclude this system of morals  THE chief spring or actuating principle of the human mind is pleasure or pain and when these sensations are remov'd both from our thought and feeling we are in a great measure incapable of passion or action of desire or volition The most immediate effects of pleasure and pain are the propense  and averse motions of the mind which are diversified into volition into desire and aversion grief and joy hope and fear according as the pleasure or pain changes its situation and becomes probable or improbable certain or uncertain or is consider'd as out of our power for the present moment But when along with this the objects that cause pleasure or pain acquire a relation to ourselves or others they still continue to excite desire and aversion grief and joy But cause at the same time the indirect passions of pride or humility love or hatred which in this case have a double relation of impressions and ideas to the pain or pleasure  WE have already observ'd that moral distinctions depend entirely on certain peculiar sentiments of pain and pleasure and that whatever mental quality in ourselves or others gives us a satisfaction by the survey or reflection is of course virtuous as every thing of this nature that gives uneasiness is vicious Now since every quality in ourselves or others which gives pleasure always causes pride or love as every one that produces uneasiness excites humility or hatred It follows that these two particulars are to be consider'd as equivalent with regard to our mental qualities  virtue  and the power  of producing love or pride  vice  and the power of producing humility or hatred In every case therefore we must judge of the one by the other and may pronounce any  quality  of the mind virtuous which causes love or pride and any one vicious which causes hatred or humility  IF any  action  be either virtuous or vicious 'tis only as a sign of some quality or character It must depend upon durable principles of the mind which extend over the whole conduct and enter into the personal character Actions themselves not proceeding from any constant principle have no influence on love or hatred pride or humimility and consequently are never consider'd in morality  THIS reflection is selfevident and deserves to be attended to as being of the utmost importance in the present subject We are never to consider any single action in our enquiries concerning the origin of morals but only the quality or character from which the action proceeded These alone are  durable  enough to affect our sentiments concerning the person Actions are indeed better indications of a character than words or even wishes and sentiments but 'tis only so far as they are such indications that they  are attended with love or hatred praise or blame  TO discover the true origin of morals and of that love or hatred which arises from mental qualities we must take the matter pretty deep and compare some principles which have been already examin'd and explain'd  WE may begin with considering anew the nature and force of  sympathy  The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations nor can any one be actuated by any affection of which all others are not in some degree susceptible As in strings equally wound up the motion of one communicates itself to the rest so all the affections readily pass from one person to another and beget correspondent movements in every human creature When I see the  effects  of passion in the voice and gesture of any person my mind immediately passes from these effects to their causes and forms such a lively idea of the passion as is presently converted into the passion itself In like manner when I perceive the  causes  of any emotion my mind is convey'd to the effects and is actuated with a like emotion Were I present at any of the more terrible operations of surgery  'tis certain that even before it begun the preparation of the instruments the laying of the bandages in order the heating of the irons with all the signs of anxiety and concern in the patient and assistants wou'd have a great effect upon my mind and excite the strongest sentiments of pity and terror No passion of another discovers itself immediately to the mind We are only sensible of its causes or effects From  these  we infer the passion And consequently  these  give rise to our sympathy  OUR sense of beauty depends very much on this principle and where any object has a tendency to produce pleasure in its possessor it is always regarded as beautiful as every object that has a tendency to produce pain is disagreeable and deform'd Thus the conveniency of a house the fertility of a field the strength of a horse the capacity security and swiftsailing of a vessel form the principal beauty of these several objects Here the object which is denominated beautiful pleases only by its tendency to produce a certain effect That effect is the pleasure or advantage of some other person Now the pleasure of a stranger for whom we have no friendship pleases us only by sympathy To this principle therefore is  owing the beauty which we find in every thing that is useful How considerable a part this is of beauty will easily appear upon reflection Wherever an object has a tendency to produce pleasure in the possessor or in other words is the proper  cause  of pleasure it is sure to please the spectator by a delicate sympathy with the possessor Most of the works of art are esteem'd beautiful in proportion to their fitness for the use of man and even many of the productions of nature derive their beauty from that source Handsome and beautiful on most occasions is not an absolute but a relative quality and pleases us by nothing but its tendency to produce an end that is agreeable  Decentior equus cujus astricta sunt ilia sed idem velocior Pulcher aspectu sit athleta cujus lacertos exercitatio expressit idem certamini paratior Nunquam vero  species  ab  utilitate  dividitur Sed hoc quidem discernere modici judicii est  Quinct  lib    THE same principle produces in many instances our sentiments of morals as well as those of beauty No virtue is more esteem'd than justice and no vice more detested than injustice nor are there any qualities which go farther to the fixing the character either as amiable or odious Now justice is a moral virtue merely because it has that tendency  to the good of mankind and indeed is nothing but an artificial invention to that purpose The same may be said of allegiance of the laws of nations of modesty and of goodmanners All these are mere human contrivances for the interest of society And since there is a very strong sentiment of morals which in all nations and all ages has attended them we must allow that the reflecting on the tendency of characters and mental qualities is sufficient to give us the sentiments of approbation and blame Now as the means to an end can only be agreeable where the end is agreeable and as the good of society where our own interest is not concern'd or that of our friends pleases only by sympathy It follows that sympathy is the source of the esteem which we pay to all the artificial virtues  THUS it appears  that  sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature  that  it has a great influence on our taste of beauty and  that  it produces our sentiment of morals in all the artificial virtues From thence we may presume that it also gives rise to many of the other virtues and that qualities acquire our approbation because of their tendency to the good of mankind This presumption must become a certainty when we  find that most of those qualities which we  naturally  approve of have actually that tendency and render a man a proper member of society While the qualities which we  naturally  disapprove of have a contrary tendency and render any intercourse with the person dangerous or disagreeable For having found that such tendencies have force enough to produce the strongest sentiment of morals we can never reasonably in these cases look for any other cause of approbation or blame it being an inviolable maxim in philosophy that where any particular cause is sufficient for an effect we ought to rest satisfied with it and ought not to multiply causes without necessity We have happily attain'd experiments in the artificial virtues where the tendency of qualities to the good of society is the  sole  cause of our approbation without any suspicion of the concurrence of another principle From thence we learn the force of that principle And where that principle may take place and the quality approv'd of is really beneficial to society a true philosopher will never require any other principle to account for the strongest approbation and esteem  THAT many of the natural virtues have this tendency to the good of society no one  can doubt of Meekness beneficence charity generosity clemency moderation equity bear the greatest figure among the moral qualities and are commonly denominated the  social  virtues to mark their tendency to the good of society This goes so far that some philosophers have represented all moral distinctions as the effect of artifice and education when skilful politicians endeavour'd to restrain the turbulent passions of men and make them operate to the public good by the notions of honour and shame This system however is not consistent with experience For  first  there are other virtues and vices beside those which have this tendency to the public advantage and loss  Secondly  had not men a natural sentiment of approbation and blame it cou'd never be excited by politicians nor wou'd the words  laudable  and  praiseworthy blameable  and  odious  be any more intelligible than if they were a language perfectly unknown to us as we have already observ'd But tho' this system be erroneous it may teach us that moral distinctions arise in a great measure from the tendency of qualities and characters to the interests of society and that 'tis our concern for that interest which makes us approve or disapprove of them Now we  have no such extensive concern for society but from sympathy and consequently 'tis that principle which takes us so far out of ourselves as to give us the same pleasure or uneasiness in the characters of others as if they had a tendency to our own advantage or loss  THE only difference betwixt the natural virtues and justice lies in this that the good which results from the former arises from every single act and is the object of some natural passion Whereas a single act of justice consider'd in itself may often be contrary to the public good and 'tis only the concurrence of mankind in a general scheme or system of action which is advantageous When I relieve persons in distress my natural humanity is my motive and so far as my succour extends so far have I promoted the happiness of my fellowcreatures But if we examine all the questions that come before any tribunal of justice we shall find that considering each case apart it wou'd as often be an instance of humanity to decide contrary to the laws of justice as conformable them Judges take from a poor man to give to a rich they bestow on the dissolute the labour of the industrious and put into the hands of the vicious the means  of harming both themselves and others The whole scheme however of law and justice is advantageous to the society and 'twas with a view to this advantage that men by their voluntary conventions establish'd it After it is once establish'd by these conventions it is  naturally  attended with a strong sentiment of morals which can proceed from nothing but our sympathy with the interests of society We need no other explication of that esteem which attends such of the natural virtues as have a tendency to the public good  I MUST farther add that there are several circumstances which render this hypothesis much more probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues 'Tis certain that the imagination is more affected by what is particular than by what is general and that the sentiments are always mov'd with difficulty where their objects are in any degree loose and undetermin'd Now every particular act of justice is not beneficial to society but the whole scheme or system And it may not perhaps be any individual person for whom we are concern'd who receives benefit from justice but the whole society alike On the contrary every particular act of generosity or  relief of the industrious and indigent is beneficial and is beneficial to a particular person who is not undeserving of it 'Tis more natural therefore to think that the tendencies of the latter virtue will affect our sentiments and command our approbation than those of the former and therefore since we find that the approbation of the former arises from their tendencies we may ascribe with better reason the same cause to the approbation of the latter In any number of similar effects if a cause can be discover'd for one we ought to extend that cause to all the other effects which can be accounted for by it But much more if these other effects be attended with peculiar circumstances which facilitate the operation of that cause  BEFORE I proceed farther I must observe two remarkable circumstances in this affair which may seem objections to the present system The first may be thus explain'd When any quality or character has a tendency to the good of mankind we are pleas'd with it and approve of it because it presents the lively idea of pleasure which idea affects us by sympathy and is itself a kind of pleasure But as this sympathy is very variable it may be thought  that our sentiments of morals must admit of all the same variations We sympathize more with persons contiguous to us than with persons remote from us With our acquaintance than with strangers With our countrymen than with foreigners But notwithstanding this variation of our sympathy we give the same approbation to the same moral qualities in  China  as in  England  They appear equally virtuous and recommend themselves equally to the esteem of a judicious spectator The sympathy varies without a variation in our esteem Our esteem therefore proceeds not from sympathy  TO this I answer The approbation of moral qualities most certainly is not deriv'd from reason or any comparison of ideas but proceeds entirely from a moral taste and from certain sentiments of pleasure or disgust which arise upon the contemplation and view of particular qualities or characters Now 'tis evident that those sentiments whenceever they are deriv'd must vary according to the distance or contiguity of the objects nor can I feel the same lively pleasure from the virtues of a person who liv'd in  Greece  two thousand years ago that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance Yet I do not say that I  esteem the one more than the other And therefore if the variation of the sentiment without a variation of the esteem be an objection it must have equal force against every other system as against that of sympathy But to consider the matter aright it has no force at all and 'tis the easiest matter in the world to account for it Our situation with regard both to persons and things is in continual fluctuation and a man that lies at a distance from us may in a little time become a familiar acquaintance Besides every particular man has a peculiar position with regard to others and 'tis impossible we cou'd ever converse together on any reasonable terms were each of us to consider characters and persons only as they appear from his peculiar point of view In order therefore to prevent those continual  contradictions  and arrive at a more  stable  judgment of things we fix on some  steady  and  general  points of view and always in our thoughts place ourselves in them whatever may be our present situation In like manner external beauty is determin'd merely by pleasure and 'tis evident a beautiful countenance cannot give so much pleasure when seen at the distance of twenty paces as when it is brought nearer us We  say not however that it appears to us less beautiful Because we know what effect it will have in such a position and by that reflection we correct its momentary appearance  IN general all sentiments of blame or praise are variable according to our situation of nearness or remoteness with regard to the person blam'd or prais'd and according to the present disposition of our mind But these variations we regard not in our general decisions but still apply the terms expressive of our liking or dislike in the same manner as if we remain'd in one point of view Experience soon teaches us this method of correcting our sentiments or at least of correcting our language where the sentiments are more stubborn and inalterable Our servant if diligent and faithful may excite stronger sentiments of love and kindness than  Marcus Brutus  as represented in history but we say not upon that account that the former character is more laudable than the latter We know that were we to approach equally near to that renown'd patriot he wou'd command a much higher degree of affection and admiration Such corrections are common with regard to all the senses and indeed 'twere impossible  we cou'd ever make use of language or communicate our sentiments to one another did we not correct the momentary appearances of things and overlook our present situation  'TIS therefore from the influence of characters and qualities upon those who have an intercourse with any person that we blame or praise him We consider not whether the persons affected by the qualities be our acquaintance or strangers countrymen or foreigners Nay we overlook our own interest in those general judgments and blame not a man for opposing us in any of our pretensions when his own interest is particularly concern'd We make allowance for a certain degree of selfishness in men because we know it to be inseparable from human nature and inherent in our frame and constitution By this reflection we correct those sentiments of blame which so naturally arise upon any opposition  BUT however the general principle of our blame or praise may be corrected by those other principles 'tis certain they are not altogether efficacious nor do our passions often correspond entirely to the present theory 'Tis seldom men heartily love what lies at a distance from them and what no  way redounds to their particular benefit as 'tis no less rare to meet with persons who can pardon another any opposition he makes to their interest however justifiable that opposition may be by the general rules of morality Here we are contented with saying that reason requires such an impartial conduct but that 'tis seldom we can bring ourselves to it and that our passions do not readily follow the determination of our judgment This language will be easily understood if we consider what we formerly said concerning that  reason  which is able to oppose our passion and which we have found to be nothing but a general calm determination of the passions founded on some distant view or reflection When we form our judgments of persons merely from the tendency of their characters to our own benefit or to that of our friends we find so many contradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation and such an uncertainty from the incessant changes of our situation that we seek some other standard of merit and demerit which may not admit of so great variation Being thus loosen'd from our first station we cannot afterwards fix ourselves so commodiously by any means as by a sympathy with those who have any  commerce with the person we consider This is far from being as lively as when our own interest is concern'd or that of our particular friends nor has it such an influence on our love and hatred But being equally conformable to our calm and general principles 'tis said to have an equal authority over our reason and to command our judgment and opinion We blame equally a bad action which we read of in history with one perform'd in our neighbourhood t'other day The meaning of which is that we know from reflection that the former action wou'd excite as strong sentiments of disapprobation as the latter were it plac'd in the same position  I NOW proceed to the  second  remarkable circumstance which I propos'd to take notice of Where a person is possess'd of a character that in its natural tendency is beneficial to society we esteem him virtuous and are delighted with the view of his character even tho' particular accidents prevent its operation and incapacitate him from being serviceable to his friends and country Virtue in rags is still virtue and the love which it procures attends a man into a dungeon or desart where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action and is lost to  all the world Now this may be esteem'd an objection to the present system Sympathy interests us in the good of mankind and if sympathy were the source of our esteem for virtue that sentiment of approbation cou'd only take place where the virtue actually attain'd its end and was beneficial to mankind Where it fails of its end 'tis only an imperfect means and therefore can never acquire any merit from that end The goodness of an end can bestow a merit on such means alone as are compleat and actually produce the end  To this we may reply that where any object in all its parts is fitted to attain any agreeable end it naturally gives us pleasure and is esteem'd beautiful even tho' some external circumstances be wanting to render it altogether effectual 'Tis sufficient if every thing be compleat in the object itself A house that is contriv'd with great judgment for all the commodities of life pleases us upon that account tho' perhaps we are sensible that noone will ever dwell in it A fertile soil and a happy climate delight us by a reflection on the happiness which they wou'd afford the inhabitants tho' at present the country be desart and uninhabited A man whose limbs and shape promise strength  and activity is esteem'd handsome tho' condemn'd to perpetual imprisonment The imagination has a set of passions belonging to it upon which our sentiments of beauty much depend These passions are mov'd by degrees of liveliness and strength which are inferior to  belief  and independent of the real existence of their objects Where a character is in every respect fitted to be beneficial to society the imagination passes easily from the cause to the effect without considering that there are still some circumstances wanting to render the cause a compleat one  General rules  create a species of probability which sometimes influences the judgment and always the imagination  'TIS true when the cause is compleat and a good disposition is attended with good fortune which renders it really beneficial to society it gives a stronger pleasure to the spectator and is attended with a more lively sympathy We are more affected by it and yet we do not say that it is more virtuous or that we esteem it more We know that an alteration of fortune may render the benevolent disposition entirely impotent and therefore we separate as much as possible the fortune from the disposition The case is the same as when we correct  the different sentiments of virtue which proceed from its different distances from ourselves The passions do not always follow our corrections but these corrections serve sufficiently to regulate our abstract notions and are alone regarded when we pronounce in general concerning the degrees of vice and virtue  'TIS observ'd by critics that all words or sentences which are difficult to the pronunciation are disagreeable to the ear There is no difference whether a man hear them pronounc'd or read them silently to himself When I run over a book with my eye I imagine I hear it all and also by the force of imagination enter into the uneasiness which the delivery of it wou'd give the speaker The uneasiness is not real but as such a composition of words has a natural tendency to produce it this is sufficient to affect the mind with a painful sentiment and render the discourse harsh and disagreeable 'Tis a similar case where any real quality is by accidental circumstances render'd impotent and is depriv'd of its natural influence on society  UPON these principles we may easily remove any contradiction which may appear to be betwixt the  extensive sympathy  on  which our sentiments of virtue depend and that  limited generosity  which I have frequently observ'd to be natural to men and which justice and property suppose according to the precedent reasoning My sympathy with another may give me the sentiment of pain and disapprobation when any object is presented that has a tendency to give him uneasiness tho' I may not be willing to sacrifice any thing of my own interest or cross any of my passions for his satisfaction A house may displease me by being illcontriv'd for the convenience of the owner and yet I may refuse to give a shilling towards the rebuilding of it Sentiments must touch the heart to make them controul our passions But they need not extend beyond the imagination to make them influence our taste When a building seems clumsy and tottering to the eye it is ugly and disagreeable tho' we be fully assur'd of the solidity of the workmanship 'Tis a kind of fear which causes this sentiment of disapprobation but the passion is not the same with that which we feel when oblig'd to stand under a wall that we really think tottering and insecure The  seeming tendencies  of objects affect the mind And the emotions they excite are of a like  species with those which proceed from the  real consequences  of objects but their feeling is different Nay these emotions are so different in their feeling that they may often be contrary without destroying each other as when the fortifications of a city belonging to an enemy are esteem'd beautiful upon account of their strength tho' we cou'd wish that they were entirely destroy'd The imagination adheres to the  general  views of things and distinguishes the feelings they produce from those which arise from our particular and momentary situation  IF we examine the panegyrics that are commonly made of great men we shall find that most of the qualities which are attributed to them may be divided into two kinds  viz  such as make them perform their part in society and such as render them serviceable to themselves and enable them to promote their own interest Their  prudence temperance frugality industry assiduity enterprize dexterity  are celebrated as well as their  generosity  and  humanity  If we ever give an indulgence to any quality that disables a man from making a figure in life 'tis to that of  indolence  which is not suppos'd to deprive one of his parts and capacity  but only suspends their exercise and that without any inconvenience to the person himself since 'tis in some measure from his own choice Yet indolence is always allow'd to be a fault and a very great one if extreme Nor do a man's friends ever acknowledge him to be subject to it but in order to save his character in more material articles He cou'd make a figure say they if he pleas'd to give application His understanding is sound his conception quick and his memory tenacious but he hates business and is indifferent about his fortune And this a man sometimes may make even a subject of vanity tho' with the air of confessing a fault Because he may think that this incapacity for business implies much more noble qualities such as a philosophical spirit a fine taste a delicate wit or a relish for pleasure and society But take any other case Suppose a quality that without being an indication of any other good qualities incapacitates a man  always  for business and is destructive to his interest such as a blundering understanding and a wrong judgment of every thing in life inconstancy and irresolution or a want of address in the management of men and business These are all allow'd to be imperfections  in a character and many men wou'd rather acknowledge the greatest crimes than have it suspected that they are in any degree subject to them  'TIS very happy in our philosophical researches when we find the same phaenomenon diversified by a variety of circumstances and by discovering what is common among them can the better assure ourselves of the truth of any hypothesis we may make use of to explain it Were nothing esteem'd virtue but what were beneficial to society I am persuaded that the foregoing explication of the moral sense ought still to be receiv'd and that upon sufficient evidence But this evidence must grow upon us when we find other kinds of virtue which will not admit of any explication except from that hypothesis Here is a man who is not remarkably defective in his social qualities but what principally recommends him is his dexterity in business by which he has extricated himself from the greatest difficulties and conducted the most delicate affairs with a singular address and prudence I find an esteem for him immediately to arise in me His company is a satisfaction to me and before I have any farther acquaintance with him I wou'd rather do him a service  than another whose character is in every other respect equal but is deficient in that particular In this case the qualities that please me are all consider'd as useful to the person and as having a tendency to promote his interest and satisfaction They are only regarded as means to an end and please me in proportion to their fitness for that end The end therefore must be agreeable to me But what makes the end agreeable The person is a stranger I am no way interested in him nor lie under any obligation to him His happiness concerns not me farther than the happiness of every human and indeed of every sensible creature That is it affects me only by sympathy From that principle whenever I discover his happiness and good whether in its causes or effects I enter so deeply into it that it gives me a sensible emotion The appearance of qualities that have a  tendency  to promote it have an agreeable effect upon my imagination and command my love and esteem  THIS theory may serve to explain why the same qualities in all cases produce both pride and love humility and hatred and the same man is always virtuous or vicious accomplish'd or despicable to others  who is so to himself A person in whom we discover any passion or habit which originally is only incommodious to himself becomes always disagreeable to us merely on its account as on the other hand one whose character is only dangerous and disagreeable to others can never be satisfied with himself as long as he is sensible of that disadvantage Nor is this observable only with regard to characters and manners but may be remark'd even in the most minute circumstances A violent cough in another gives us uneasiness tho' in itself it does not in the least affect us A man will be mortified if you tell him he has a stinking breath tho' 'tis evidently no annoyance to himself Our fancy easily changes its situation and either surveying ourselves as we appear to others or considering others as they feel themselves we enter by that means into sentiments which no way belong to us and in which nothing but sympathy is able to interest us And this sympathy we sometimes carry so far as even to be displeas'd with a quality commodious to us merely because it displeases others and makes us disagreeable in their eyes tho' perhaps we never can have any interest in rendering ourselves agreeable to them  THERE have been many systems of morality advanc'd by philosophers in all ages but if they are strictly examin'd they may be reduc'd to two which alone merit our attention Moral good and evil are certainly distinguish'd by our  sentiments  not by  reason  But these sentiments may arise either from the mere species or appearance of characters and passions or from reflections on their tendency to the happiness of mankind and of particular persons My opinion is that both these causes are intermix'd in our judgments of morals after the same manner as they are in our decisions concerning most kinds of external beauty Tho' I am also of opinion that reflections on the tendencies of actions have by far the greatest influence and determine all the great lines of our duty There are however instances in cases of less moment wherein this immediate taste or sentiment produces our approbation Wit and a certain easy and disengag'd behaviour are qualities  immediately agreeable  to others and command their love and esteem Some of these qualities produce satisfaction in others by particular  original  principles of human nature which cannot be accounted for Others may be resolv'd into principles  which are more general This will best appear upon a particular enquiry  As some qualities acquire their merit from their being  immediately agreeable  to others without any tendency to public interest so some are denominated virtuous from their being  immediately agreeable  to the person himself who possesses them Each of the passions and operations of the mind has a particular feeling which must be either agreeable or disagreeable The first is virtuous the second vicious This particular feeling constitutes the very nature of the passion and therefore needs not be accounted for  BUT however directly the distinction of vice and virtue may seem to flow from the immediate pleasure or uneasiness which particular qualities cause to ourselves or others 'tis easy to observe that it has also a considerable dependence on the principle of  sympathy  so often insisted on We approve of a person who is possess'd of qualities  immediately agreeable  to those with whom he has any commerce tho' perhaps we ourselves never reap'd any pleasure from them We also approve of one who is possess'd of qualities that are  immediately agreeable  to himself tho' they be of no service to  any mortal To account for this we must have recourse to the foregoing principles  THUS to take a general review of the present hypothesis Every quality of the mind is denominated virtuous which gives pleasure by the mere survey as every quality which produces pain is call'd vicious This pleasure and this pain may arise from four different sources For we reap a pleasure from the view of a character which is naturally fitted to be useful to others or to the person himself or which is agreeable to others or to the person himself One may perhaps be surpriz'd that amidst all these interests and pleasures we shou'd forget our own which touches us so nearly on every other occasion But we shall easily satisfy ourselves on this head when we consider that every particular person's pleasure and interest being different 'tis impossible men cou'd ever agree in their sentiments and judgments unless they chose some common point of view from which they might survey their object and which might cause it to appear the same to all of them Now in judging of characters the only interest and pleasure which appears the same to every spectator is that of the person himself whose character is examin'd or that  of persons who have a connexion with him And tho' such interests and pleasures touch us more faintly than our own yet being more constant and universal they counterballance the latter even in practice and are alone admitted in speculation as the standard of virtue and morality They alone produce that particular feeling or sentiment on which moral distinctions depend  AS to the good or ill desert of virtue or vice 'tis an evident consequence of the sentiments of pleasure or uneasiness These sentiments produce love or hatred and love or hatred by the original constitution of human passion is attended with benevolence or anger that is with a desire of making happy the person we love and miserable the person we hate We have treated of this more fully on another occasion  SECT II  Of greatness of mind  IT may now be proper to illustrate this general system of morals by applying it to particular instances of virtue and vice and shewing how their merit or demerit  arises from the four sources here explain'd We shall begin with examining the passions of  pride  and  humility  and shall consider the vice or virtue that lies in their excesses or just proportion An excessive pride or overweaning conceit of ourselves is always esteem'd vicious and is universally hated as modesty or a just sense of our weakness is esteem'd virtuous and procures the goodwill of everyone Of the four sources of moral distinctions this is to be ascrib'd to the  third  viz the immediate agreeableness and disagreeableness of a quality to others without any reflections on the tendency of that quality  IN order to prove this we must have recourse to two principles which are very conspicuous in human nature The  first  of these is the  sympathy  and communication of sentiments and passions abovemention'd So close and intimate is the correspondence of human souls that no sooner any person approaches me than he diffuses on me all his opinions and draws along my judgment in a greater or lesser degree And tho' on many occasions my sympathy with him goes not so far as entirely to change my sentiments and way of thinking yet it seldom is so weak as not to disturb the easy course  of my thought and give an authority to that opinion which is recommended to me by his assent and approbation Nor is it any way material upon what subject he and I employ our thoughts Whether we judge of an indifferent person or of my own character my sympathy gives equal force to his decision And even his sentiments of his own merit make me consider him in the same light in which he regards himself  THIS principle of sympathy is of so powerful and insinuating a nature that it enters into most of our sentiments and passions and often takes place under the appearance of its contrary For 'tis remarkable that when a person opposes me in any thing which I am strongly bent upon and rouzes up my passion by contradiction I have always a degree of sympathy with him nor does my commotion proceed from any other origin We may here observe an evident conflict or rencounter of opposite principles and passions On the one side there is that passion or sentiment which is natural to me and 'tis observable that the stronger this passion is the greater is the commotion There must also be some passion or sentiment on the other side and this passion can proceed from nothing but sympathy The  sentiments of others can never affect us but by becoming in some measure our own in which case they operate upon us by opposing and encreasing our passions in the very same manner as if they had been originally deriv'd from our own temper and disposition While they remain conceal'd in the minds of others they can never have any influence upon us And even when they are known if they went no farther than the imagination or conception that faculty is so accustom'd to objects of every different kind that a mere idea tho' contrary to our sentiments and inclinations wou'd never alone be able to affect us  THE  second  principle I shall take notice of is that of  comparison  or the variation of our judgments concerning objects according to the proportion they bear to those with which we compare them We judge more of objects by comparison than by their intrinsic worth and value and regard every thing as mean when set in opposition to what is superior of the same kind But no comparison is more obvious than that with ourselves and hence it is that on all occasions it takes place and mixes with most of our passions This kind of comparison is directly contrary to sympathy in its operation  as we have observ'd in treating of  compassion  and  malice  Book II Part II Sect VIII  In all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another to which it is compar'd a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure and therefore produces pain when compar'd with our own His pain consider'd in itself is painful but augments the idea of our own happiness and gives us pleasure  SINCE then those principles of sympathy and a comparison with ourselves are directly contrary it may be worth while to consider what general rules can be form'd beside the particular temper of the person for the prevalence of the one or the other Suppose I am now in safety at land and wou'd willingly reap some pleasure from this consideration I must think on the miserable condition of those who are at sea in a storm and must endeavour to render this idea as strong and lively as possible in order to make me more sensible of my own happiness But whatever pains I may take the comparison will never have an equal efficacy  as if I were really on  Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis  E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem  Non quia vexari quenquam est jucunda voluptas  Sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suav' est  Lucret  the shore and saw a ship at a distance tost by a tempest and in danger every moment of perishing on a rock or sandbank But suppose this idea to become still more lively Suppose the ship to be driven so near me that I can perceive distinctly the horror painted on the countenance of the seamen and passengers hear their lamentable cries see the dearest friends give their last adieu or embrace with a resolution to perish in each others arms No man has so savage a heart as to reap any pleasure from such a spectacle or withstand the motions of the tenderest compassion and sympathy 'Tis evident therefore there is a medium in this case and that if the idea be too feint it has no influence by comparison and on the other hand if it be too strong it operates on us entirely by sympathy which is the contrary to comparison Sympathy being the conversion of an idea into an impression demands a greater force and vivacity in the idea than is requisite to comparison  ALL this is easily applied to the present subject We sink very much in our own  eyes when in the presence of a great man or one of a superior genius and this humility makes a considerable ingredient in that  respect  which we pay our superiors according to our  Book II Part II Sect X  foregoing reasonings on that passion Sometimes even envy and hatred arise from the comparison but in the greatest part of men it rests at respect and esteem As sympathy has such a powerful influence on the human mind it causes pride to have in some measure the same effect as merit and by making us enter into those elevated sentiments which the proud man entertains of himself presents that comparison which is so mortifying and disagreeable Our judgment does not entirely accompany him in the flattering conceit in which he pleases himself but still is so shaken as to receive the idea it presents and to give it an influence above the loose conceptions of the imagination A man who in an idle humour wou'd form a notion of a person of a merit very much superior to his own wou'd not be mortified by that fiction But when a man whom we are really persuaded to be of inferior merit is presented to us if we observe in him any extraordinary degree of pride and selfconceit  the firm persuasion he has of his own merit takes hold of the imagination and diminishes us in our own eyes in the same manner as if he were really possess'd of all the good qualities which he so liberally attributes to himself Our idea is here precisely in that medium which is requisite to make it operate on us by comparison Were it accompanied with belief and did the person appear to have the same merit which he assumes to himself it wou'd have a contrary effect and wou'd operate on us by sympathy The influence of that principle wou'd then be superior to that of comparison contrary to what happens where the person's merit seems below his pretensions  THE necessary consequence of these principles is that pride or an overweaning conceit of ourselves must be vicious since it causes uneasiness in all men and presents them every moment with a disagreeable comparison 'Tis a trite observation in philosophy and even in common life and conversation that 'tis our own pride which makes us so much displeas'd with the pride of other people and that vanity becomes insupportable to us merely because we are vain The gay naturally associate themselves with the gay and the amorous with the  amorous But the proud never can endure the proud and rather seek the company of those who are of an opposite disposition As we are all of us proud in some degree pride is universally blam'd and condemn'd by all mankind as having a natural tendency to cause uneasiness in others by means of comparison And this effect must follow the more naturally that those who have an illgrounded conceit of themselves are for ever making those comparisons nor have they any other method of supporting their vanity A man of sense and merit is pleas'd with himself independent of all foreign considerations But a fool must always find some person that is more foolish in order to keep himself in good humour with his own parts and understanding  BUT tho' an overweaning conceit of our own merit be vicious and disagreeable nothing can be more laudable than to have a value for ourselves where we really have qualities that are valuable The utility and advantage of any quality to ourselves is a source of virtue as well as its agreeableness to others and 'tis certain that nothing is more useful to us in the conduct of life than a due degree of pride which makes  us sensible of our own merit and gives us a confidence and assurance in all our projects and enterprizes Whatever capacity any one may be endow'd with 'tis entirely useless to him if he be not acquainted with it and form not designs suitable to it 'Tis requisite on all occasions to know our own force and were it allowable to err on either side 'twou'd be more advantageous to overrate our merit than to form ideas of it below its just standard Fortune commonly favours the bold and enterprizing and nothing inspires us with more boldness than a good opinion of ourselves  ADD to this that tho' pride or selfapplause be sometimes disagreeable to others 'tis always agreeable to ourselves as on the other hand modesty tho' it give pleasure to every one who observes it produces often uneasiness in the person endow'd with it Now it has been observ'd that our own sensations determine the vice and virtue of any quality as well as those sensations which it may excite in others  THUS selfsatisfaction and vanity may not only be allowable but requisite in a character 'Tis however certain that goodbreeding and decency require that we shou'd avoid all signs and expressions which tend  directly to show that passion We have all of us a wonderful partiality for ourselves and were we always to give vent to our sentiments in this particular we shou'd mutually cause the greatest indignation in each other not only by the immediate presence of so disagreeable a subject of comparison but also by the contrariety of our judgments In like manner therefore as we establish the  laws of nature  in order to secure property in society and prevent the opposition of selfinterest we establish the  rules of goodbreeding  in order to prevent the opposition of men's pride and render conversation agreeable and inoffensive Nothing is more disagreeable than a man's overweaning conceit of himself Every one almost has a strong propensity to this vice No one can well distinguish  in himself  betwixt the vice and virtue or be certain that his esteem of his own merit is wellfounded For these reasons all direct expressions of this passion are condemn'd nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of men of sense and merit They are not allow'd to do themselves justice openly in words no more than other people and even if they show a reserve and secret doubt in doing themselves justice in  their own thoughts they will be more applauded That impertinent and almost universal propensity of men to overvalue themselves has given us such a  prejudice  against selfapplause that we are apt to condemn it by a  general rule  wherever me meet with it and 'tis with some difficulty we give a privilege to men of sense even in their most secret thoughts At least it must be own'd that some disguise in this particular is absolutely requisite and that if we harbour pride in our breasts we must carry a fair outside and have the appearance of modesty and mutual deference in all our conduct and behaviour We must on every occasion be ready to prefer others to ourselves to treat them with a kind of deference even tho' they be our equals to seem always the lowest and least in the company where we are not very much distinguish'd above them And if we observe these rules in our conduct men will have more indulgence for our secret sentiments when we discover them in an oblique manner  I BELIEVE no one who has any practice of the world and can penetrate into the inward sentiments of men will assert that the humility which goodbreeding and decency require of us goes beyond the outside  or that a thorough sincerity in this particular is esteem'd a real part of our duty On the contrary we may observe that a genuine and hearty pride or selfesteem if well conceal'd and well founded is essential to the character of a man of honour and that there is no quality of the mind which is more indispensibly requisite to procure the esteem and approbation of mankind There are certain deferences and mutual submissions which custom requires of the different ranks of men towards each other and whoever exceeds in this particular if thro' interest is accus'd of meanness if thro' ignorance of simplicity 'Tis necessary therefore to know our rank and station in the world whether it be fix'd by our birth fortune employments talents or reputation 'Tis necessary to feel the sentiment and passion of pride in conformity to it and to regulate our actions accordingly And shou'd it be said that prudence may suffice to regulate our actions in this particular without any real pride I wou'd observe that here the object of prudence is to conform our actions to the general usage and custom and that 'tis impossible those tacit airs of superiority shou'd ever have been establish'd  and authoriz'd by custom unless men were generally proud and unless that passion were generally approv'd when wellgrounded  IF we pass from common life and conversation to history this reasoning acquires new force when we observe that all those great actions and sentiments which have become the admiration of mankind are founded on nothing but pride and selfesteem  Go  says  Alexander  the Great to his soldiers when they refus'd to follow him to the  Indies go tell your countrymen that you left Alexander compleating the conquest of the world  This passage was always particularly admir'd by the prince of  Conde  as we learn from  St Evremond  "Alexander"  said that prince  "abandon'd by his soldiers among barbarians not yet fully subdu'd felt in himself such a dignity and right of empire that he cou'd not believe it possible any one cou'd refuse to obey him Whether in  Europe  or in  Asia  among  Greeks  or  Persians  all was indifferent to him Wherever he found men he fancied he had found subjects"  IN general we may observe that whatever we call  heroic virtue  and admire under the character of greatness and elevation of mind is either nothing but a steady and wellestablish'd pride and selfesteem or  partakes largely of that passion Courage intrepidity ambition love of glory magnanimity and all the other shining virtues of that kind have plainly a strong mixture of selfesteem in them and derive a great part of their merit from that origin Accordingly we find that many religious declaimers decry those virtues as purely pagan and natural and represent to us the excellency of the  Christian  religion which places humility in the rank of virtues and corrects the judgment of the world and even of philosophers who so generally admire all the efforts of pride and ambition Whether this virtue of humility has been rightly understood I shall not pretend to determine I am content with the concession that the world naturally esteems a wellregulated pride which secretly animates our conduct without breaking out into such indecent expressions of vanity as may offend the vanity of others  THE merit of pride or selfesteem is deriv'd from two circumstances  viz  its utility and its agreeableness to ourselves by which it capacitates us for business and at the same time gives us an immediate satisfaction When it goes beyond its just bounds it loses the first advantage and even becomes prejudicial  which is the reason why we condemn an extravagant pride and ambition however regulated by the decorums of goodbreeding and politeness But as such a passion is still agreeable and conveys an elevated and sublime sensation to the person who is actuated by it the sympathy with that satisfaction diminishes considerably the blame which naturally attends its dangerous influence on our conduct and behaviour Accordingly we may observe that an excessive courage and magnanimity especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune contributes in a great measure to the character of a hero and will render a person the admiration of posterity at the same time that it ruins his affairs and leads him into dangers and difficulties with which otherwise he wou'd never have been acquainted  HEROISM or military glory is much admir'd by the generality of mankind They consider it as the most sublime kind of merit Men of cool reflection are not so sanguine in their praises of it The infinite confusions and disorder which it has caus'd in the world diminish much of its merit in their eyes When they wou'd oppose the popular notions on this head they  always paint out the evils which this suppos'd virtue has produc'd in human society the subversion of empires the devastation of provinces the sack of cities As long as these are present to us we are more inclin'd to hate than admire the ambition of heroes But when we fix our view on the person himself who is the author of all this mischief there is something so dazling in his character the mere contemplation of it so elevates the mind that we cannot refuse it our admiration The pain which we receive from its tendency to the prejudice of society is overpower'd by a stronger and more immediate sympathy  THUS our explication of the merit or demerit which attends the degrees of pride or selfesteem may serve as a strong argument for the preceding hypothesis by shewing the effects of those principles above explain'd in all the variations of our judgments concerning that passion Nor will this reasoning be advantageous to us only by shewing that the distinction of vice and virtue arises from the  four  principles of the  advantage  and of the  pleasure  of the  person himself  and of  others  But may also afford us  a strong proof of some underparts of that hypothesis  NO one who duly considers of this matter will make any scruple of allowing that any piece of illbreeding or any expression of pride and haughtiness is displeasing to us merely because it shocks our own pride and leads us by sympathy into a comparison which causes the disagreeable passion of humility Now as an insolence of this kind is blam'd even in a person who has always been civil to ourselves in particular nay in one whose name is only known to us in history it follows that our disapprobation proceeds from a sympathy with others and from the reflection that such a character is highly displeasing and odious to every one who converses or has any intercourse with the person possest of it We sympathize with those people in their uneasiness and as their uneasiness proceeds in part from a sympathy with the person who insults them we may here observe a double rebound of the sympathy which is a principle very similar to what we have observ'd on another occasion  Book II Part II Sect V    SECT III  Of goodness and benevolence  HAVING thus explain'd the origin of that praise and approbation which attends every thing we call  great  in human affections we now proceed to give an account of their  goodness  and shew whence its merit is deriv'd  WHEN experience has once given us a competent knowledge of human affairs and has taught us the proportion they bear to human passion we perceive that the generosity of men is very limited and that it seldom extends beyond their friends and family or at most beyond their native country Being thus acquainted with the nature of man we expect not any impossibilities from him but confine our view to that narrow circle in which any person moves in order to form a judgment of his moral character When the natural tendency of his passions leads him to be serviceable and useful within his sphere we approve of his character and love his person by a sympathy  with the sentiments of those who have a more particular connexion with him We are quickly oblig'd to forget our own interest in our judgments of this kind by reason of the perpetual contradictions we meet with in society and conversation from persons that are not plac'd in the same situation and have not the same interest with ourselves The only point of view in which our sentiments concur with those of others is when we consider the tendency of any passion to the advantage or harm of those who have any immediate connexion or intercourse with the person possess'd of it And tho' this advantage or harm be often very remote from ourselves yet sometimes 'tis very near us and interests us strongly by sympathy This concern we readily extend to other cases that are resembling and when these are very remote our sympathy is proportionably weaker and our praise or blame fainter and more doubtful The case is here the same as in our judgments concerning external bodies All objects seem to diminish by their distance But tho' the appearance of objects to our senses be the original standard by which we judge of them yet we do not say that they actually diminish by the distance but correcting the appearance  by reflection arrive at a more constant and establish'd judgment concerning them In like manner tho' sympathy be much fainter than our concern for ourselves and a sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter than that with persons near and contiguous yet we neglect all these differences in our calm judgments concerning the characters of men Besides that we ourselves often change our situation in this particular we every day meet with persons who are in a different situation from ourselves and who cou'd never converse with us on any reasonable terms were we to remain constantly in that situation and point of view which is peculiar to us The intercourse of sentiments therefore in society and conversation makes us form some general inalterable standard by which we may approve or disapprove of characters and manners And tho' the  heart  does not always take part with those general notions or regulate its love and hatred by them yet are they sufficient for discourse and serve all our purposes in company in the pulpit on the theatre and in the schools  FROM these principles we may easily account for that merit which is commonly ascrib'd to  generosity humanity compassion  gratitude friendship fidelity zeal disinterestedness liberality  and all those other qualities which form the character of good and benevolent A propensity to the tender passions makes a man agreeable and useful in all the parts of life and gives a just direction to all his other qualities which otherwise may become prejudicial to society Courage and ambition when not regulated by benevolence are fit only to make a tyrant and public robber 'Tis the same case with judgment and capacity and all the qualities of that kind They are indifferent in themselves to the interests of society and have a tendency to the good or ill of mankind according as they are directed by these other passions  AS love is  immediately agreeable  to the person who is actuated by it and hatred  immediately disagreeable  this may also be a considerable reason why we praise all the passions that partake of the former and blame all those that have any considerable share of the latter 'Tis certain we are infinitely touch'd with a tender sentiment as well as with a great one The tears naturally start in our eyes at the conception of it nor can we forbear giving a loose to the same tenderness towards the person who exerts  it All this seems to me a proof that our approbation has in those cases an origin different from the prospect of utility and advantage either to ourselves or others To which we may add that men naturally without reflection approve of that character which is most like their own The man of a mild disposition and tender affections in forming a notion of the most perfect virtue mixes in it more of benevolence and humanity than the man of courage and enterprize who naturally looks upon a certain elevation of mind as the most accomplish'd character This must evidently proceed from an  immediate  sympathy which men have with characters similar to their own They enter with more warmth into such sentiments and feel more sensibly the pleasure which arises from them  'TIS remarkable that nothing touches a man of humanity more than any instance of extraordinary delicacy in love or friendship where a person is attentive to the smallest concerns of his friend and is willing to sacrifice to them the most considerable interest of his own Such delicacies have little influence on society because they make us regard the greatest trifles But they are the more engaging the more minute the concern is and  are a proof of the highest merit in any one who is capable of them The passions are so contagious that they pass with the greatest facility from one person to another and produce correspondent movements in all human breasts Where friendship appears in very signal instances my heart catches the same passion and is warm'd by those warm sentiments that display themselves before me Such agreeable movements must give me an affection to every one that excites them This is the case with every thing that is agreeable in any person The transition from pleasure to love is easy But the transition must here be still more easy since the agreeable sentiment which is excited by sympathy is love itself and there is nothing requir'd but to change the object  HENCE the peculiar merit of benevolence in all its shapes and appearances Hence even its weaknesses are virtuous and amiable and a person whose grief upon the loss of a friend were excessive wou'd be esteem'd upon that account His tenderness bestows a merit as it does a pleasure on his melancholy  WE are not however to imagine that all the angry passions are vicious tho' they are disagreeable There is a certain indulgence  due to human nature in this respect Anger and hatred are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution The want of them on some occasions may even be a proof of weakness and imbecillity And where they appear only in a low degree we not only excuse them because they are natural but even bestow our applauses on them because they are inferior to what appears in the greatest part of mankind  WHERE these angry passions rise up to cruelty they form the most detested of all vices All the pity and concern which we have for the miserable sufferers by this vice turns against the person guilty of it and produces a stronger hatred than we are sensible of on any other occasion  EVEN when the vice of inhumanity rises not to this extreme degree our sentiments concerning it are very much influenc'd by reflections on the harm that results from it And we may observe in general that if we can find any quality in a person which renders him incommodious to those who live and converse with him we always allow it to be a fault or blemish without any farther examination On the other hand when we enumerate the good qualities of any person we always mention those parts of his character  which render him a safe companion an easy friend a gentle master an agreeable husband or an indulgent father We consider him with all his relations in society and love or hate him according as he affects those who have any immediate intercourse with him And 'tis a most certain rule that if there be no relation of life in which I cou'd not wish to stand to a particular person his character must so far be allow'd to be perfect If he be as little wanting to himself as to others his character is entirely perfect This is the ultimate test of merit and virtue  SECT IV  Of natural abilities  NO distinction is more usual in all systems of ethics than that betwixt  natural abilities  and  moral virtues  where the former are plac'd on the same footing with bodily endowments and are suppos'd to have no merit or moral worth annex'd to them Whoever considers the matter accurately will find that a dispute upon this head wou'd be merely a dispute of words  and that tho' these qualities are not altogether of the same kind yet they agree in the most material circumstances They are both of them equally mental qualities And both of them equally produce pleasure and have of course an equal tendency to procure the love and esteem of mankind There are few who are not as jealous of their character with regard to sense and knowledge as to honour and courage and much more than with regard to temperance and sobriety Men are even afraid of passing for goodnatur'd lest  that  shou'd be taken for want of understanding And often boast of more debauches than they have been really engag'd in to give themselves airs of fire and spirit In short the figure a man makes in the world the reception he meets with in company the esteem paid him by his acquaintance all these advantages depend almost as much upon his good sense and judgment as upon any other part of his character Let a man have the best intentions in the world and be the farthest from all injustice and violence he will never be able to make himself be much regarded without a moderate share at least of parts and understanding Since then natural abilities tho' perhaps inferior yet are on the  same footing both as to their causes and effects with those qualities which we call moral virtues why shou'd we make any distinction betwixt them  THO' we refuse to natural abilities the title of virtues we must allow that they procure the love and esteem of mankind that they give a new lustre to the other virtues and that a man possess'd of them is much more intitled to our goodwill and services than one entirely void of them It may indeed be pretended that the sentiment of approbation which those qualities produce besides its being  inferior  is also somewhat  different  from that which attends the other virtues But this in my opinion is not a sufficient reason for excluding them from the catalogue of virtues Each of the virtues even benevolence justice gratitude integrity excites a different sentiment or feeling in the spectator The characters of  Caesar  and  Cato  as drawn by  Sallust  are both of them virtuous in the strictest sense of the word but in a different way Nor are the sentiments entirely the same which arise from them The one produces love the other esteem The one is amiable the other awful We cou'd wish to meet with the one character in a friend the other character  we wou'd be ambitious of in ourselves In like manner the approbation which attends natural abilities may be somewhat different to the feeling from that which arises from the other virtues without making them entirely of a different species And indeed we may observe that the natural abilities no more than the other virtues produce not all of them the same kind of approbation Good sense and genius beget esteem Wit and humour excite love  Love and esteem are at the bottom the same passions and arise from like causes The qualities that produce both are agreeable and give pleasure But where this pleasure is severe and serious or where its object is great and makes a strong impression or where it produces any degree of humility and awe In all these cases the passion which arises from the pleasure is more properly denominated esteem than love Benevolence attends both But is connected with love in a more eminent degree    THOSE who represent the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues as very material may say that the former are entirely involuntary and have therefore no merit attending them as having no dependance on liberty and freewill But to this I answer  first  that many of those qualities which all moralists especially the antients comprehend under the title of moral virtues are equally involuntary and necessary with the qualities of the judgment and imagination  Of this nature are constancy fortitude magnanimity and in short all the qualities which form the  great  man I might say the same in some degree of the others it being almost impossible for the mind to change its character in any considerable article or cure itself of a passionate or splenetic temper when they are natural to it The greater degree there is of these blameable qualities the more vicious they become and yet they are the less voluntary  Secondly  I wou'd have any one give me a reason why virtue and vice may not be involuntary as well as beauty and deformity These moral distinctions arise from the natural distinctions of pain and pleasure and when we receive those feelings from the general consideration of any quality or character we denominate it vicious or virtuous Now I believe no one will assert that a quality can never produce pleasure or pain to the person who considers it unless it be perfectly voluntary in the person who possesses it  Thirdly  As to freewill we have shewn that it has no place with regard to the actions no more than the qualities of men It is not a just consequence that what is voluntary is free Our actions are more voluntary than our judgments but we  have not more liberty in the one than in the other  BUT tho' this distinction betwixt voluntary and involuntary be not sufficient to justify the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues yet the former distinction will afford us a plausible reason why moralists have invented the latter Men have observ'd that tho' natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the same footing there is however this difference betwixt them that the former are almost invariable by any art or industry while the latter or at least the actions that proceed from them may be chang'd by the motives of rewards and punishments praise and blame Hence legislators and divines and moralists have principally applied themselves to the regulating these voluntary actions and have endeavour'd to produce additional motives for being virtuous in that particular They knew that to punish a man for folly or exhort him to be prudent and sagacious wou'd have but little effect tho' the same punishments and exhortations with regard to justice and injustice might have a considerable influence But as men in common life and conversation do not carry those ends in view but naturally praise or blame  whatever pleases or displeases them they do not seem much to regard this distinction but consider prudence under the character of virtue as well as benevolence and penetration as well as justice Nay we find that all moralists whose judgment is not perverted by a strict adherence to a system enter into the same way of thinking and that the antient moralists in particular made no scruple of placing prudence at the head of the cardinal virtues There is a sentiment of esteem and approbation which may be excited in some degree by any faculty of the mind in its perfect state and condition and to account for this sentiment is the business of  Philosophers  It belongs to  Grammarians  to examine what qualities are entitled to the denomination of  virtue  nor will they find upon trial that this is so easy a task as at first sight they may be apt to imagine  THE principal reason why natural abilities are esteem'd is because of their tendency to be useful to the person who is possess'd of them 'Tis impossible to execute any design with success where it is not conducted with prudence and discretion nor will the goodness of our intentions alone suffice to procure us a happy issue to our enterprizes  Men are superior to beasts principally by the superiority of their reason and they are the degrees of the same faculty which set such an infinite difference betwixt one man and another All the advantages of art are owing to human reason and where fortune is not very capricious the most considerable part of these advantages must fall to the share of the prudent and sagacious  WHEN it is ask'd whether a quick or a slow apprehension be most valuable whether one that at first view penetrates into a subject but can perform nothing upon study or a contrary character which must work out every thing by dint of application whether a clear head or a copious invention whether a profound genius or a sure judgment in short what character or peculiar understanding is more excellent than another 'Tis evident we can answer none of these questions without considering which of those qualities capacitates a man best for the world and carries him farthest in any of his undertakings  THERE are many other qualities of the mind whose merit is deriv'd from the same origin  Industry perseverance patience activity vigilance application constancy  with other virtues of that kind which 'twill be  easy to recollect are esteem'd valuable upon no other account than their advantage in the conduct of life 'Tis the same case with  temperance frugality oeconomy resolution  As on the other hand  prodigality luxury irresolution uncertainty  are vicious merely because they draw ruin upon us and incapacitate us for business and action  As wisdom and goodsense are valued because they are  useful  to the person possess'd of them so  wit  and  eloquence  are valued because they are  immediately agreeable  to others On the other hand  good humour  is lov'd and esteem'd because it is  immediately agreeable  to the person himself 'Tis evident that the conversation of a man of wit is very satisfactory as a chearful goodhumour'd companion diffuses a joy over the whole company from a sympathy with his gaiety These qualities therefore being agreeable they naturally beget love and esteem and answer to all the characters of virtue  'Tis difficult to tell on many occasions what it is that renders one man's conversation so agreeable and entertaining and another's so insipid and distasteful As conversation is a transcript of the mind as well as books the same qualities which render the one  valuable must give us an esteem for the other This we shall consider afterwards In the mean time it may be affirm'd in general that all the merit a man may derive from his conversation which no doubt may be very considerable arises from nothing but the pleasure it conveys to those who are present  IN this view  cleanliness  is also to be regarded as a virtue since it naturally renders us agreeable to others and is a very considerable source of love and affection No one will deny that a negligence in this particular is a fault and as faults are nothing but smaller vices and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation which it excites in others we may in this instance seemingly so trivial clearly discover the origin of the moral distinction of vice and virtue in other instances  BESIDES all those qualities which render a person lovely or valuable there is also a certain  jenesçaiquoi  of agreeable and handsome that concurs to the same effect In this case as well as in that of wit and eloquence we must have recourse to a certain sense which acts without reflection and regards not the tendencies of qualities and characters Some moralists account for all  the sentiments of virtue by this sense Their hypothesis is very plausible Nothing but a particular enquiry can give the preference to any other hypothesis When we find that almost all the virtues have such particular tendencies and also find that these tendencies are sufficient alone to give a strong sentiment of approbation We cannot doubt after this that qualities are approv'd of in proportion to the advantage which results from them  THE  decorum  or  indecorum  of a quality with regard to the age or character or station contributes also to its praise or blame This decorum depends in a great measure upon experience 'Tis usual to see men lose their levity as they advance in years Such a degree of gravity therefore and such years are connected together in our thoughts When we observe them separated in any person's character this imposes a kind of violence on our imagination and is disagreeable  THAT faculty of the soul which of all others is of the least consequence to the character and has the least virtue or vice in its several degrees at the same time that it admits of a great variety of degrees is the  memory  Unless it rise up to that stupendous  height as to surprize us or sink so low as in some measure to affect the judgment we commonly take no notice of its variations nor ever mention them to the praise or dispraise of any person 'Tis so far from being a virtue to have a good memory that men generally affect to complain of a bad one and endeavouring to persuade the world that what they say is entirely of their own invention sacrifice it to the praise of genius and judgment Yet to consider the matter abstractedly 'twou'd be difficult to give a reason why the faculty of recalling past ideas with truth and clearness shou'd not have as much merit in it as the faculty of placing our present ideas in such an order as to form true propositions and opinions The reason of the difference certainly must be that the memory is exerted without any sensation of pleasure or pain and in all its middling degrees serves almost equally well in business and affairs But the least variations in the judgment are sensibly felt in their consequences while at the same time that faculty is never exerted in any eminent degree without an extraordinary delight and satisfaction The sympathy with this utility and pleasure bestows a merit on the understanding and the absence of it makes us  consider the memory as a faculty very indifferent to blame or praise  BEFORE I leave this subject of  natural abilities  I must observe that perhaps one source of the esteem and affection which attends them is deriv'd from the  importance  and  weight  which they bestow on the person possess'd of them He becomes of greater consequence in life His resolutions and actions affect a greater number of his fellowcreatures Both his friendship and enmity are of moment And 'tis easy to observe that whoever is elevated after this manner above the rest of mankind must excite in us the sentiments of esteem and approbation Whatever is important engages our attention fixes our thought and is contemplated with satisfaction The histories of kingdoms are more interesting than domestic stories The histories of great empires more than those of small cities and principalities And the histories of wars and revolutions more than those of peace and order We sympathize with the persons that suffer in all the various sentiments which belong to their fortunes The mind is occupied by the multitude of the objects and by the strong passions that display themselves And this occupation or agitation of the mind is  commonly agreeable and amusing The same theory accounts for the esteem and regard we pay to men of extraordinary parts and abilities The good and ill of multitudes are connected with their actions Whatever they undertake is important and challenges our attention Nothing is to be overlook'd and despis'd that regards them And where any person can excite these sentiments he soon acquires our esteem unless other circumstances of his character render him odious and disagreeable  SECT V  Some farther reflections concerning the natural virtues  IT has been observ'd in treating of the passions that pride and humility love and hatred are excited by any advantages or disadvantages of the  mind body  or  fortune  and that these advantages or disadvantages have that effect by producing a separate impression of pain or pleasure The pain or pleasure which arises from the general survey or view of any action or quality of the  mind  constitutes its vice or virtue and gives  rise to our approbation or blame which is nothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love or hatred We have assign'd four different sources of this pain and pleasure and in order to justify more fully that hypothesis it may here be proper to observe that the advantages or disadvantages of the  body  and of  fortune  produce a pain or pleasure from the very same principles The tendency of any object to be  useful  to the person possess'd of it or to others to convey  pleasure  to him or to others all these circumstances convey an immediate pleasure to the person who considers the object and command his love and approbation  TO begin with the advantages of the  body  we may observe a phaenomenon which might appear somewhat trivial and ludicrous if any thing cou'd be trivial which fortified a conclusion of such importance or ludicrous which was employ'd in a philosophical reasoning 'Tis a general remark that those we call good  women's men  who have either signaliz'd themselves by their amorous exploits or whose make of body promises any extraordinary vigour of that kind are well received by the fair sex and naturally engage the affections even of those whose virtue prevents any design of ever giving employment  to those talents Here 'tis evident that the ability of such a person to give enjoyment is the real source of that love and esteem he meets with among the females at the same time that the women who love and esteem him have no prospect of receiving that enjoyment themselves and can only be affected by means of their sympathy with one that has a commerce of love with him This instance is singular and merits our attention  ANOTHER source of the pleasure we receive from considering bodily advantages is their utility to the person himself who is possess'd of them 'Tis certain that a considerable part of the beauty of men as well as of other animals consists in such a conformation of members as we find by experience to be attended with strength and agility and to capacitate the creature for any action or exercise Broad shoulders a lank belly firm joints taper legs all these are beautiful in our species because they are signs of force and vigour which being advantages we naturally sympathize with they convey to the beholder a share of that satisfaction they produce in the possessor  SO far as to the  utility  which may attend any quality of the body As to the immediate  pleasure  'tis certain that an air of health as well as of strength and agility makes a considerable part of beauty and that a sickly air in another is always disagreeable upon account of that idea of pain and uneasiness which it conveys to us On the other hand we are pleas'd with the regularity of our own features tho' it be neither useful to ourselves nor others and 'tis necessary for us in some measure to set ourselves at a distance to make it convey to us any satisfaction We commonly consider ourselves as we appear in the eyes of others and sympathize with the advantageous sentiments they entertain with regard to us  HOW far the advantages of  fortune  produce esteem and approbation from the same principles we may satisfy ourselves by reflecting on our precedent reasoning on that subject We have observ'd that our approbation of those who are possess'd of the advantages of fortune may be ascrib'd to three different causes  First  To that immediate pleasure which a rich man gives us by the view of the beautiful cloaths equipage gardens or houses which he possesses  Secondly  To the advantage which we hope to reap from him by his generosity and liberality  Thirdly  To the pleasure and advantage  which he himself reaps from his possessions and which produce an agreeable sympathy in us Whether we ascribe our esteem of the rich and great to one or all of these causes we may clearly see the traces of those principles which give rise to the sense of vice and virtue I believe most people at first sight will be inclin'd to ascribe our esteem of the rich to selfinterest and the prospect of advantage But as 'tis certain that our esteem or deference extends beyond any prospect of advantage to ourselves 'tis evident that that sentiment must proceed from a sympathy with those who are dependent on the person we esteem and respect and who have an immediate connexion with him We consider him as a person capable of contributing to the happiness or enjoyment of his fellowcreatures whose sentiments with regard to him we naturally embrace And this consideration will serve to justify my hypothesis in preferring the  third  principle to the other two and ascribing our esteem of the rich to a sympathy with the pleasure and advantage which they themselves receive from their possessions For as even the other two principles cannot operate to a due extent or account for all the phaenomena without having recourse to a sympathy  of one kind or other 'tis much more natural to chuse that sympathy which is immediate and direct than that which is remote and indirect To which we may add that where the riches or power are very great and render the person considerable and important in the world the esteem attending them may in part be ascrib'd to another source distinct from these three  viz  their interesting the mind by a prospect of the multitude and importance of their consequences Tho' in order to account for the operation of this principle we must also have recourse to  sympathy  as we have observ'd in the preceding section  IT may not be amiss on this occasion to remark the flexibility of our sentiments and the several changes they so readily receive from the objects with which they are conjoin'd All the sentiments of approbation which attend any particular species of objects have a great resemblance to each other tho' deriv'd from different sources and on the other hand those sentiments when directed to different objects are different to the feeling tho' deriv'd from the same source Thus the beauty of all visible objects causes a pleasure pretty much the same tho' it be sometimes deriv'd from the mere  species  and  appearance of the objects sometimes from sympathy and an idea of their utility In like manner whenever we survey the actions and characters of men without any particular interest in them the pleasure or pain which arises from the survey with some minute differences is in the main of the same kind tho' perhaps there be a great diversity in the causes from which it is deriv'd On the other hand a convenient house and a virtuous character cause not the same feeling of approbation even tho' the source of our approbation be the same and flow from sympathy and an idea of their utility There is something very inexplicable in this variation of our feelings but 'tis what we have experience of with regard to all our passions and sentiments  SECT VI  Conclusion of this book  THUS upon the whole I am hopeful that nothing is wanting to an accurate proof of this system of ethics We are certain that sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature We are also  certain that it has a great influence on our sense of beauty when we regard external objects as well as when we judge of morals We find that it has force sufficient to give us the strongest sentiments of approbation when it operates alone without the concurrence of any other principle as in the cases of justice allegiance chastity and goodmanners We may observe that all the circumstances requisite for its operation are found in most of the virtues which have for the most part a tendency to the good of society or to that of the person possess'd of them If we compare all these circumstances we shall not doubt that sympathy is the chief source of moral distinctions especially when we reflect that no objection can be rais'd against this hypothesis in one case which will not extend to all cases Justice is certainly approv'd of for no other reason than because it has a tendency to the public good And the public good is indifferent to us except so far as sympathy interests us in it We may presume the like with regard to all the other virtues which have a like tendency to the public good They must derive all their merit from our sympathy with those who reap any advantage from them As the virtues which have a  tendency to the good of the person possess'd of them derive their merit from our sympathy with him  MOST people will readily allow that the useful qualities of the mind are virtuous because of their utility This way of thinking is so natural and occurs on so many occasions that few will make any scruple of admitting it Now this being once admitted the force of sympathy must necessarily be acknowledg'd Virtue is consider'd as means to an end Means to an end are only valued so far as the end is valued But the happiness of strangers affects us by sympathy alone To that principle therefore we are to ascribe the sentiment of approbation which arises from the survey of all those virtues that are useful to society or to the person possess'd of them These form the most considerable part of morality  WERE it proper in such a subject to bribe the readers assent or employ any thing but solid argument we are here abundantly supplied with topics to engage the affections All lovers of virtue and such we all are in speculation however we may degenerate in practice must certainly be pleas'd to see  moral distinctions deriv'd from so noble a source which gives us a just notion both of the  generosity  and  capacity  of human nature It requires but very little knowledge of human affairs to perceive that a sense of morals is a principle inherent in the soul and one of the most powerful that enters into the composition But this sense must certainly acquire new force when reflecting on itself it approves of those principles from whence it is deriv'd and finds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin Those who resolve the sense of morals into original instincts of the human mind may defend the cause of virtue with sufficient authority but want the advantage which those possess who account for that sense by an extensive sympathy with mankind According to their system not only virtue must be approv'd of but also the sense of virtue And not only that sense but also the principles from whence it is deriv'd So that nothing is presented on any side but what is laudable and good  THIS observation may be extended to justice and the other virtues of that kind Tho' justice be artificial the sense of its morality is natural 'Tis the combination of men in a system of conduct which renders  any act of justice beneficial to society But when once it has that tendency we  naturally  approve of it and if we did not so 'tis impossible any combination or convention cou'd ever produce that sentiment  MOST of the inventions of men are subject to change They depend upon humour and caprice They have a vogue for a time and then sink into oblivion It may perhaps be apprehended that if justice were allow'd to be a human invention it must be plac'd on the same footing But the cases are widely different The interest on which justice is founded is the greatest imaginable and extends to all times and places It cannot possibly be serv'd by any other invention It is obvious and discovers itself on the very first formation of society All these causes render the rules of justice stedfast and immutable at least as immutable as human nature And if they were founded on original instincts cou'd they have any greater stability  THE same system may help us to form a just notion of the  happiness  as well as of the  dignity  of virtue and may interest every principle of our nature in the embracing and cherishing that noble quality Who indeed does not feel an accession of alacrity in  his pursuits of knowledge and ability of every kind when he considers that besides the advantage which immediately result from these acquisitions they also give him a new lustre in the eyes of mankind and are universally attended with esteem and approbation And who can think any advantages of fortune a sufficient compensation for the least breach of the  social  virtues when he considers that not only his character with regard to others but also his peace and inward satisfaction entirely depend upon his strict observance of them and that a mind will never be able to bear its own survey that has been wanting in its part to mankind and society But I forbear insisting on this subject Such reflections require a work apart very different from the genius of the present The anatomist ought never to emulate the painter nor in his accurate dissections and portraitures of the smaller parts of the human body pretend to give his figures any graceful and engaging attitude or expression There is even something hideous or at least minute in the views of things which he presents and 'tis necessary the objects shou'd be set more at a distance and be more cover'd up from sight to make them engaging to the eye and imagination An  anatomist however is admirably fitted to give advice to a painter and 'tis even impracticable to excel in the latter art without the assistance of the former We must have an exact knowledge of the parts their situation and connexion before we can design with any elegance or correctness And thus the most abstract speculations concerning human nature however cold and unentertaining become subservient to  practical morality  and may render this latter science more correct in its precepts and more persuasive in its exhortations  APPENDIX  _THERE is nothing I wou'd more willingly lay hold of than an opportunity of confessing my errors and shou'd esteem such a return to truth and reason to be more honourable than the most unerring judgment A man who is free from mistakes can pretend to no praises except from the justness of his understanding But a man who corrects his mistakes shews at once the justness of his understanding and the candour and ingenuity of his temper I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover any very considerable mistakes in the reasonings deliver'd in the preceding volumes except on one article But I have found by experience that some of my expressions have not been so well chosen as to guard against all mistakes in the readers and 'tis chiefly to remedy this defect I have subjoin'd the following appendix  WE can never be induc'd to believe any matter of fact except where its cause or its effect is present to us but what the nature is of that belief which arises from the relation of cause and effect few have had the curiosity to ask themselves In my opinion this dilemma is inevitable Either the belief is some new idea such as that of  reality  or  existence  which we join to the simple conception of an object or it is merely a peculiar  feeling  or  sentiment  That it is not a new idea annex'd to the simple conception may be evinc'd from these two arguments  First  We have no abstract idea of existence distinguishable and separable from the idea of particular objects 'Tis impossible therefore that this idea of existence can be annex'd to the idea of any object or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief  Secondly  The mind has the command over all its ideas and can separate unite mix and vary them as it pleases so that if belief consisted merely in a new idea annex'd to the conception it wou'd be in a man's power to believe what he pleas'd We may therefore conclude that belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment in something that depends  not on the will but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles of which we are not masters When we are convinc'd of any matter of fact we do nothing but conceive it along with a certain feeling different from what attends the mere  reveries  of the imagination And when we express our incredulity concerning any fact we mean that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere conception whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination wou'd be on an equal footing with the most establish'd truths founded on history and experience There is nothing but the feeling or sentiment to distinguish the one from the other  THIS therefore being regarded as an undoubted truth  that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling different from the simple conception  the next question that naturally occurs is  what is the nature of this feeling or sentiment and whether it be analogous to any other sentiment of the human mind  This question is important For if it be not analogous to any other sentiment we must despair of explaining its causes and must consider it as an original principle of the human  mind If it be analogous we may hope to explain its causes from analogy and trace it up to more general principles Now that there is a greater firmness and solidity in the conceptions which are the objects of conviction and assurance than in the loose and indolent reveries of a castlebuilder every one will readily own They strike upon us with more force they are more present to us the mind has a firmer hold of them and is more actuated and mov'd by them It acquiesces in them and in a manner fixes and reposes itself on them In short they approach nearer to the impressions which are immediately present to us and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind  THERE is not in my opinion any possibility of evading this conclusion but by asserting that belief beside the simple conception consists in some impression or feeling distinguishable from the conception It does not modify the conception and render it more present and intense It is only annex'd to it after the same manner that  will  and  desire  are annex'd to particular conceptions of good and pleasure But the following considerations will I hope be sufficient to remove this hypothesis  First  It is  directly contrary to experience and our immediate consciousness All men have ever allow'd reasoning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas and however those ideas may be varied to the feeling there is nothing ever enters into our  conclusions  but ideas or our fainter conceptions For instance I hear at present a person's voice whom I am acquainted with and this sound comes from the next room This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thoughts to the person along with all the surrounding objects I paint them out to myself as existent at present with the same qualities and relations that I formerly knew them possess'd of These ideas take faster hold of my mind than the ideas of an inchanted castle They are different to the feeling but there is no distinct or separate impression attending them 'Tis the same case when I recollect the several incidents of a journey or the events of any history Every particular fact is there the object of belief Its idea is modified differently from the loose reveries of a castlebuilder But no distinct impression attends every distinct idea or conception of matter of fact This is the subject of plain experience If ever this experience can be disputed on any occasion  'tis when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties and afterwards upon taking the object in a new point of view or being presented with a new argument fixes and reposes itself in one settled conclusion and belief In this case there is a feeling distinct and separate from the conception The passage from doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose conveys a satisfaction and pleasure to the mind But take any other case Suppose I see the legs and thighs of a person in motion while some interpos'd object conceals the rest of his body Here 'tis certain the imagination spreads out the whole figure I give him a head and shoulders and breast and neck These members I conceive and believe him to be possess'd of Nothing can be more evident than that this whole operation is perform'd by the thought or imagination alone The transition is immediate The ideas presently strike us Their customary connexion with the present impression varies them and modifies them in a certain manner but produces no act of the mind distinct from this peculiarity of conception Let any one examine his own mind and he will evidently find this to be the truth  Secondly  Whatever may be the case with regard to this distinct impression it must be allow'd that the mind has a firmer hold or more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact than of fictions Why then look any farther or multiply suppositions without necessity  Thirdly  We can explain the  causes  of the firm conception but not those of any separate impression And not only so but the causes of the firm conception exhaust the whole subject and nothing is left to produce any other effect An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object that is frequently conjoin'd or is associated with a present impression This is the whole of it Every part is requisite to explain from analogy the more steady conception and nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression  Fourthly  The  effects  of belief in influencing the passions and imagination can all be explain'd from the firm conception and there is no occasion to have recourse to any other principle These arguments with many others enumerated in the foregoing volumes sufficiently prove that belief only modifies the idea or conception and renders  it different to the feeling without producing any distinct impression  THUS upon a general view of the subject there appear to be two questions of importance which we may venture to recommend to the consideration of philosophers  Whether there be any thing to distinguish belief from the simple conception beside the feeling or sentiment  And  Whether this feeling be any thing but a firmer conception or a faster hold that we take of the object  IF upon impartial enquiry the same conclusion that I have form'd be assented to by philosophers the next business is to examine the analogy which there is betwixt belief and other acts of the mind and find the cause of the firmness and strength of conception And this I do not esteem a difficult task The transition from a present impression always enlivens and strengthens any idea When any object is presented the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us as something real and solid 'Tis  felt  rather than conceiv'd and approaches the impression from which it is deriv'd in its force and influence This I have prov'd at large I cannot add any new arguments tho' perhaps my reasoning on this whole question concerning cause and effect wou'd  have been more convincing had the following passages been inserted in the places which I have mark'd for them I have added a few illustrations on other points where I thought it necessary  To be inserted in  Vol I page line  after these words  fainter and more obscure  beginning a new paragraph  IT frequently happens that when two men have been engag'd in any scene of action the one shall remember it much better than the other and shall have all the difficulty in the world to make his companion recollect it He runs over several circumstances in vain mentions the time the place the company what was said what was done on all sides till at last he hits on some lucky circumstance that revives the whole and gives his friend a perfect memory of every thing Here the person that forgets receives at first all the ideas from the discourse of the other with the same circumstances of time and place tho' he considers them as mere fictions of the imagination But as soon as the circumstance is mention'd that touches the memory the very same ideas now appear in a new light and have  in a manner a different feeling from what they had before Without any other alteration beside that of the feeling they become immediately ideas of the memory and are assented to  SINCE therefore the imagination can represent all the same objects that the memory can offer to us and since those faculties are only distinguish'd by the different  feeling  of the ideas they present it may be proper to consider what is the nature of that feeling

after these words  according to the foregoing definition  beginning a new paragraph  THIS operation of the mind which forms the belief of any matter of fact seems hitherto to have been one of the greatest mysteries of philosophy tho' no one has so much as suspected that there was any difficulty in explaining it For my part I must own that I find a considerable difficulty in the case and that even when I think I understand the subject perfectly I am at a  loss for terms to express my meaning I conclude by an induction which seems to me very evident that an opinion or belief is nothing but an idea that is different from a fiction not in the nature or the order of its parts but in the  manner  of its being conceiv'd But when I wou'd explain this  manner  I scarce find any word that fully answers the case but am oblig'd to have recourse to every one's feeling in order to give him a perfect notion of this operation of the mind An idea assented to  feels  different from a fictitious idea that the fancy alone presents to us And this different feeling I endeavour to explain by calling it a superior  force  or  vivacity  or  solidity  or  firmness  or  steadiness  This variety of terms which may seem so unphilosophical is intended only to express that act of the mind which renders realities more present to us than fictions causes them to weigh more in the thought and gives them a superior influence on the passions and imagination Provided we agree about the thing 'tis needless to dispute about the terms The imagination has the command over all its ideas and can join and mix and vary them in all the ways possible It may conceive objects with all the circumstances of place and time It may set them  in a manner before our eyes in their true colours just as they might have existed But as it is impossible that that faculty can ever of itself reach belief 'tis evident that belief consists not in the nature and order of our ideas but in the manner of their conception and in their feeling to the mind I confess that 'tis impossible to explain perfectly this feeling or manner of conception We may make use of words that express something near it But its true and proper name is  belief  which is a term that every one sufficiently understands in common life And in philosophy we can go no farther than assert that it is something  felt  by the mind which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from the fictions of the imagination It gives them more force and influence makes them appear of greater importance infixes them in the mind and renders them the governing

may be to which this vivacity rise 'tis evident that in poetry it never has the same  feeling  with that which arises in the mind when we reason tho' even upon the lowest species of probability The mind can easily distinguish betwixt the one and the other and whatever emotion the poetical enthusiasm may give to the spirits 'tis still the mere phantom of belief or persuasion The case is the same with the idea as with the passion it occasions There is no passion of the human mind but what may arise from poetry tho' at the same time the  feelings  of the passions are very different when excited by poetical fictions from what they are when they arise from belief and reality A passion which is disagreeable in real life may afford the highest entertainment in a tragedy or epic poem In the latter case it lies not with that weight upon us It feels less firm and solid And has no other than the agreeable effect of exciting the spirits and rouzing the attention The difference in the passions is a clear proof of a like difference in those ideas from which the passions are deriv'd Where the vivacity arises from a customary conjunction with a present impression tho' the imagination may not in appearance be so  much mov'd yet there is always something more forcible and real in its actions than in the fervors of poetry and eloquence The force of our mental actions in this case no more than in any other is not to be measur'd by the apparent agitation of the mind A poetical description may have a more sensible effect on the fancy than an historical narration It may collect more of those circumstances that form a compleat image or picture It may seem to set the object before us in more lively colours But still the ideas it presents are different to the  feeling  from those which arise from the memory and the judgment There is something weak and imperfect amidst all that seeming vehemence of thought and sentiment which attends the fictions of poetry  WE shall afterwards have occasion to remark both the resemblances and differences betwixt a poetical enthusiasm and a serious conviction In the mean time I cannot forbear observing that the great difference in their feeling proceeds in some measure from reflection and  general rules  We observe that the vigour of conception which fictions receive from poetry and eloquence is a circumstance merely accidental of which every idea is equally susceptible and that such  fictions are connected with nothing that is real This observation makes us only lend ourselves so to speak to the fiction But causes the idea to feel very different from the eternal establish'd persuasions founded on memory and custom They are somewhat of the same kind But the one is much inferior to the other both in its causes and effects  A LIKE reflection on  general rules  keeps us from augmenting our belief upon every encrease of the force and vivacity of our ideas Where an opinion admits of no doubt or opposite probability we attribute to it a full conviction tho' the want of resemblance or contiguity may render its force inferior to that of other opinions 'Tis thus the understanding corrects the appearances of the senses and makes us imagine that an object at twenty foot distance seems even to the eye as large as one of the same dimensions at ten  To be inserted in  Vol I page line ult  after these words  any idea of power  beginning a new paragraph  SOME have asserted that we feel an energy or power in our own mind and  that having in this manner acquir'd the idea of power we transfer that quality to matter where we are not able immediately to discover it The motions of our body and the thoughts and sentiments of our mind say they obey the will nor do we seek any farther to acquire a just notion of force or power But to convince us how fallacious this reasoning is we need only consider that the will being here consider'd as a cause has no more a discoverable connexion with its effects than any material cause has with its proper effect So far from perceiving the connexion betwixt an act of volition and a motion of the body 'tis allow'd that no effect is more inexplicable from the powers and essence of thought and matter Nor is the empire of the will over our mind more intelligible The effect is there distinguishable and separable from the cause and cou'd not be foreseen without the experience of their constant conjunction We have command over our mind to a certain degree but beyond  that  lose all empire over it And 'tis evidently impossible to fix any precise bounds to our authority where we consult not experience In short the actions of the mind are in this respect the same with those of matter We perceive only their constant conjunction nor  can we ever reason beyond it No internal impression has an apparent energy more than external objects have Since therefore matter is confess'd by philosophers to operate by an unknown force we shou'd in vain hope to attain an idea of force by consulting our own minds  The same imperfection attends our ideas of the Deity but this can have no effect either on religion or morals The order of the universe proves an omnipotent mind that is a mind whose will is  constantly attended  with the obedience of every creature and being Nothing more is requisite to give a foundation to all the articles of religion nor is it necessary we shou'd form a distinct idea of the force and energy of the supreme Being    I HAD entertain'd some hopes that however deficient our theory of the intellectual world might be it wou'd be free from those contradictions and absurdities which seem to attend every explication that human reason can give of the material world But upon a more strict review of the section concerning  personal identity  I find myself involv'd in such a labyrinth that I must confess I neither know how to correct my former opinions nor how to render them consistent If this be not a good  general  reason for scepticism 'tis at least a sufficient one if I were not already abundantly supplied for me to entertain a diffidence and modesty in  all my decisions I shall propose the arguments on both sides beginning with those that induc'd me to deny the strict and proper identity and simplicity of a self or thinking being  WHEN we talk of  self  or  substance  we must have an idea annex'd to these terms otherwise they are altogether unintelligible Every idea is deriv'd from preceding impressions and we have no impression of self or substance as something simple and individual We have therefore no idea of them in that sense  WHATEVER is distinct is distinguishable and whatever is distinguishable is separable by the thought or imagination All perceptions are distinct They are therefore distinguishable and separable and may be conceiv'd as separately existent and may exist separately without any contradiction or absurdity  WHEN I view this table and that chimney nothing is present to me but particular perceptions which are of a like nature with all the other perceptions This is the doctrine of philosophers But this table which is present to me and that chimney may and do exist separately This is the doctrine of the vulgar and implies no contradiction There is no contradiction  therefore in extending the same doctrine to all the perceptions  IN general the following reasoning seems satisfactory All ideas are borrow'd from preceding perceptions Our ideas of objects therefore are deriv'd from that source Consequently no proposition can be intelligible or consistent with regard to objects which is not so with regard to perceptions But 'tis intelligible and consistent to say that objects exist distinct and independent without any common  simple  substance or subject of inhesion This proposition therefore can never be absurd with regard to perceptions  WHEN I turn my reflection on  myself  I never can perceive this  self  without some one or more perceptions nor can I ever perceive any thing but the perceptions 'Tis the composition of these therefore which forms the self  WE can conceive a thinking being to have either many or few perceptions Suppose the mind to be reduc'd even below the life of an oyster Suppose it to have only one perception as of thirst or hunger Consider it in that situation Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception Have you any notion of  self  or  substance  If not the  addition of other perceptions can never give you that notion  THE annihilation which some people suppose to follow upon death and which entirely destroys this self is nothing but an extinction of all particular perceptions love and hatred pain and pleasure thought and sensation These therefore must be the same with self since the one cannot survive the other  IS  self  the same with  substance  If it be how can that question have place concerning the subsistence of self under a change of substance If they be distinct what is the difference betwixt them For my part I have a notion of neither when conceiv'd distinct from particular perceptions  PHILOSOPHERS begin to be reconcil'd to the principle  that we have no idea of external substance distinct from the ideas of particular qualities  This must pave the way for a like principle with regard to the mind  that we have no notion of it distinct from the particular perceptions  So far I seem to be attended with sufficient evidence But having thus loosen'd all our particular perceptions when  Vol I page  I proceed to explain the principle of connexion which  binds them together and makes us attribute to them a real simplicity and identity I am sensible that my account is very defective and that nothing but the seeming evidence of the precedent reasonings cou'd have induc'd me to receive it If perceptions are distinct existences they form a whole only by being connected together But no connexions among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding We only  feel  a connexion or determination of the thought to pass from one object to another It follows therefore that the thought alone finds personal identity when reflecting on the train of past perceptions that compose a mind the ideas of them are felt to be connected together and naturally introduce each other However extraordinary this conclusion may seem it need not surprize us Most philosophers seem inclin'd to think that personal identity  arises  from consciousness and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception The present philosophy therefore has so far a promising aspect But all my hopes vanish when I come to explain the principles that unite our successive perceptions in our thought or consciousness I cannot discover any theory which gives me satisfaction on this head  IN short there are two principles which I cannot render consistent nor is it in my power to renounce either of them viz  that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences  and  that the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences  Did our perceptions either inhere in something simple and individual or did the mind perceive some real connexion among them there wou'd be no difficulty in the case For my part I must plead the privilege of a sceptic and confess that this difficulty is too hard for my understanding I pretend not however to pronounce it absolutely insuperable Others perhaps or myself upon more mature reflections may discover some hypothesis that will reconcile those contradictions  I SHALL also take this opportunity of confessing two other errors of less importance which more mature reflection has discover'd to me in my reasoning The first may be found in Vol I page where I say that the distance betwixt two bodies is known among other things by the angles which the rays of light flowing from the bodies make with each other 'Tis certain that these angles are not known to the mind and consequently can never discover the  distance The second error may be found in Vol I page where I say that two ideas of the same object can only be different by their different degrees of force and vivacity I believe there are other differences among ideas which cannot properly be comprehended under these terms Had I said that two ideas of the same object can only be different by their different  feeling  I shou'd have been nearer the truth  THERE are two errors of the press which affect the sense and therefore the reader is desir'd to correct them In Vol I page line penult for  as the perception  read  a perception  In Vol I p line for  moral  read  natural  A note to  Vol I page line  to the word  resemblance  'TIS evident that even different simple ideas may have a similarity or resemblance to each other nor is it necessary that the point or circumstance of resemblance shou'd be distinct or separable from that in which they differ  Blue  and  green  are different simple ideas but are more resembling than  blue  and  scarlet  tho' their perfect simplicity excludes all possibility of separation or  distinction 'Tis the same case with particular sounds and tastes and smells These admit of infinite resemblances upon the general appearance and comparison without having any common circumstance the same And of this we may be certain even from the very abstract terms  simple idea  They comprehend all simple ideas under them These resemble each other in their simplicity And yet from their very nature which excludes all composition this circumstance in which they resemble is not distinguishable nor separable from the rest 'Tis the same case with all the degrees in any quality They are all resembling and yet the quality in any individual is not distinct from the degree  To be inserted in  Vol I page line  after these words  of the present difficulty  beginning a new paragraph  THERE are many philosophers who refuse to assign any standard of  equality  but assert that 'tis sufficient to present two objects that are equal in order to give us a just notion of this proportion All definitions say they are fruitless without the perception of such objects and where we  perceive such objects we no longer stand in need of any definition To this reasoning I entirely agree and assert that the only useful notion of equality or inequality is deriv'd from the whole united appearance and the comparison of particular objects For 'tis evident that the eye  c  To be inserted in  Vol I page line  after these words  practicable or imaginable  beginning a new paragraph  To whatever side mathematicians turn this dilemma still meets them If they judge of equality or any other proportion by the accurate and exact standard  viz  the enumeration of the minute indivisible parts they both employ a standard which is useless in practice and actually establish the indivisibility of extension which they endeavour to explode Or if they employ as is usual the inaccurate standard deriv'd from a comparison of objects upon their general appearance corrected by measuring and juxta position their first principles tho' certain and infallible are too coarse to afford any such subtile inferences as they commonly draw from them The first principles are founded on the imagination and senses The  conclusion therefore can never go beyond much less contradict these faculties  A note to  Vol I page line  to these words  impressions and ideas  As long as we confine our speculations to  the appearances  of objects to our senses without entering into disquisitions concerning their real nature and operations we are safe from all difficulties and can never be embarrass'd by any question Thus if it be ask'd if the invisible and intangible distance interpos'd betwixt two objects be something or nothing 'Tis easy to answer that it is  something  viz a property of the objects which affect the  senses  after such a particular manner If it be ask'd whether two objects having such a distance betwixt them touch or not It may be answer'd that this depends upon the definition of the word  touch  If objects be said to touch when there is nothing  sensible  interpos'd betwixt them these objects touch If objects be said to touch when their  images  strike contiguous parts of the eye and when the hand  feels  both objects successively without any interpos'd motion these objects do not touch The appearances of objects to our senses are  all consistent and no difficulties can ever arise but from the obscurity of the terms we make use of  IF we carry our enquiry beyond the appearances of objects to the senses I am afraid that most of our conclusions will be full of scepticism and uncertainty Thus if it be ask'd whether or not the invisible and intangible distance be always full of  body  or of something that by an improvement of our organs might become visible or tangible I must acknowledge that I find no very decisive arguments on either side tho' I am inclin'd to the contrary opinion as being more suitable to vulgar and popular notions If  the Newtonian  philosophy be rightly understood it will be found to mean no more A vacuum is asserted That is bodies are said to be plac'd after such a manner as to receive bodies betwixt them without impulsion or penetration The real nature of this position of bodies is unknown We are only acquainted with its effects on the senses and its power of receiving body Nothing is more suitable to that philosophy than a modest scepticism to a certain degree and a fair confession of ignorance in subjects that exceed all human capacity  FINIS
