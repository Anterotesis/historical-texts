 The MONUMENT  A POEM Sacred to the IMMORTAL MEMORY of the Best and Greatest of Kings William the Third King of  Great Britain  c  Quo nihil majus meliusve Terris  Fata donavere bonique Divi  Nec dabunt quamvis redeant in Aurum  Tempora Priscum  Horat Carm Lib  By Mr  DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for  D Brown  at the BlackSwan and Bible without  TempleBar  and  A Bell  at the CrossKeys and Bible in  Cornhil  MDCCII  TO THE Most Noble and Mighty PRINCE WILLIAM Duke of DEVONSHIRE Lord STEWARD of Her Majesty's Houshold AND Knight of the most Noble Order of the GARTER c  MY LORD  IF the following POEM had been written by a Person who had a Genius equal to the Subject it would in a peculiar manner have belong'd to Your Grace For to whom should a Poet sooner address the Praises of a King who will be eternally Glorious for the Restoring and Maintaining our Liberties  and the common Liberties of  Europe  than to Your Grace who has always appear'd so Great a Defender of them and has ventur'd and done and suffer'd for them more than any Subject in  England  The ardent Love of Liberty and of Your Country are some of the many Heroick Qualities which You have inherited from Your Noble Ancestors and some of the many which Your Grace has the Happiness to see deriv'd from Your Noble Self by the other Hope of Your August Family The Wisdom Foresight Resolution and Greatness of Soul that the Brave Lord  Candish  so constantly shew'd in the last Parliaments of K  Charles  the Second will never be forgotten as long as an  Englishman  remains alive Ev'n then when it was esteem'd by some an unpardonable Crime to be thought one even then Your Grace and that Illustrious Friend whose Memory shall always be Dear to all the faithful Lovers of their Country both of You heroically dar'd to appear at the Head of  Englishmen  resolv'd to assert their Privileges He gloriously seal'd the Love of his Country with his Blood but even after the Loss of the best of Friends Your Grace persever'd with an undaunted Spirit in the Noble Cause of Liberty Nor could the just Grief which You paid to his Memory hinder You from paying that Duty which You ow'd to Your Country which has always deservedly been Your first Affection If some other Persons at that time would have entred into the Wisdom  of both Your Counsels You your selves had saved us without the Help of the King Your Noble Friend as Your Grace's Self had been one of the living Ornaments of Your delivered Country and there had been no need of the Revolution nor perhaps of the long War that succeeded it It was neither His nor Your Grace's Fault that You were not then sufficiently seconded and consequently that You did not save these Nations all that Blood and Treasure which the War has cost them But when afterwards things were brought to that Extremity that a Revolution was absolutely necessary no Man did more than Your Grace towards the bringing it about and working our Deliverance that way Your Grace was then the most Glorious Instrument of establishing the best of Kings upon the Throne of  England  and defending her present Majesty at so dangerous a Juncture as that of the Revolution She wisely thought that She could have no where recourse to a better Place for Her Safety than where Your Grace was known to direct by Your Counsels and to animate by Your Courage the Brave Assertors of Liberty  I have a long time design'd to lay something of mine at Your Grace's Feet that it might live and grow and flourish under so Illustrious a Patronage But the Awe that I stood in of the Force of Your Judgment and the Fineness of Your Discernment made me wait for this Opportunity For I know very well that I either  ought never to approach You this way at all or to do it when I can be most secure of my self And tho what I offer You now is far from meriting so High a Protection yet I have less Mistrust of it than of any thing I have done in Poetry Besides the Design and the Immortal Subject may supply in some measure the Weakness of my Performance For I am confident that Your Grace will not refuse to grant that Protection to the Vindication of the King's Memory which the King at Your Grace's Request granted to the Rights and Privileges of every  Englishman  I am  MY LORD  Your Grace's most Humble most Dutiful and most Obedient Servant John Dennis  THE PREFACE  THE following Poem was writ without any manner of Design of obliging or offending a Party For in all my Lifetime I never designed either to please or offend any and was always of Opinion that he who makes his Court to any is sure to do it to the wrong for if all Men were for the Publick Good there never could be any Party because a Patriot designs the Good of his Country but one of a Party intends his own  THE following Poem was writ with an Intention to do what Service I could to my Country at this Conjuncture which as Mr  Waller  has truly observed is a Duty incumbent upon the Muses Friend  THE Muses Friend unto himself severe  With silent Pity looks on all that err  But if a great a publick Action shines  That he rewards with his▪ Immortal Lines  Whether it be in Council or in Fight  His Countries Honour is his chief Delight  Praise of great Acts he scatters as a Seed  Which may the like in coming Ages breed  THIS is certain that the late King delivered us from a de+plorable State Now we who were once in a condition to want Deliverer may hereafter be in such a Condition again for who has happened may happen But since as Mr  Waller  observes most Heroes are incited to the noble Acts they perform by a De+sire of Praise who will be at the Trouble to save or defend People so ingrateful as to refuse them that  I DESIRE that the Reader would take two Cautions along with him The one that he would not interpret that Love of Libe+ty which will be found in the following Poem for an Aversion Monarchy for Liberty is as consistent with the Government  of One as with that of a Thousand The other is that he would by no means mistake the Reflexions upon the Army which he  Dutch  had in for a Satyr upon the Nation in general For I have a long time known the  Dutch  to be a Vaiant a Wise and a Great People and their Country to be one of the strongest Bulwarks of the Liberties of  Europe  IF any one happens to wonder that I have employed so many Verses in describing the Battel of  Seneffe  without dwelling afterwards upon any other of the Glorious Actions of the King as the Battel of  Mons  or that of the  Boyn  or the Siege of  Namur  I desire him to consider that in Descriptions of all Fights there is something resembling and by consequence that one such Description for so short a work is enough and that from among all the Actions of the King I chose the Battel of  Seneffe  because of the Brave Army opposed to Him and the Great Prince of  Conde  who headed them and because it is the greatest of all the Actions in which the King or perhaps any other Captain ever has been engaged and above all▪ because the Success of the Allies was undeniably due to the King's Valour and Conduct  THE following Poem was writ with a Design of showing the King and not my self and written in the Language not of the Head but the Heart 'Tis written in Blank Verse and not in Ryme not only because I thought that the former would  give me the more Liberty but for several other Reasons which will offer themselves immediately to all who are Judges of Poetry and which signify nothing to the rest I will only put the Reader in mind that Mr  Milton  looked upon Ryme as a Bondage and my Lord  Roscommon  and Mr  Dryden  as a Barbarity Mr  Milton  tells us in his Preface to  Paradise lost  that Ryme is trivial to Judicious Ears and of no true Musical Delight and Mr  Dryden  in his Verses before the Essay upon translated Verse that Poetry flourished in  Greece  and  Rome  Till barbarous Nations and more barbarous Times  Debas'd the Majesty of Verse to Rymes  Mr  Dryden  threw it off in Dramatick Poetry as Mr  Milton  had done in Heroick and as my Lord  Roscommon  would have done if he had lived to write any more of which the following Lines in the Essay upon translated Verse may be sufficient to satisfy us  OF many Faults Ryme is perhaps the Cause  Too true to Ryme we slight more useful Laws  For that in  Greece  or  Rome  was never known  Till by  Barbarian  Deluges o'erflown  Subdu'd undone they did at last obey  And change their own for their Invaders Way  I GRANT that from some Mossy Idol Oak  In double Rymes our  Thor  and  Woden  spoke  And by Succession of unlearned Times  As Bards began so Monks rung on the Chimes  BUT now that  Phoebus  and the Sacred Nine  With all their Beams on our blest Island shine  Why should not we their antient Rites restore  And be what  Rome  or  Athens  were before  O MAY I live to Hail the Glorious Day  And sing loud  Peans  thro the crouded Way  When in Triumphant State the  British  Muse  True to herself shall barbarous Aid refuse  And in the  Roman  Majesty appear  Which none no better and none come so near  FROM what has been said it is plain that three of our Poets who have been deservedly celebrated for the Fineness of their Ears have condemned and exploded Ryme not only as an Enemy to Art and a Clog to Genius and a Debaser of the Majesty of Verse but as a thing of barbarous Sound and contrary to true Musical Delight And I am confident that those three Gentlemen if they had been alive would have been pleased to have seen in the following Poem an attempt to second that generous Design which the first of them began and which the two others approved of a Design to shake off a barbarous Custom and to shew the Harmony of our Mother Tongue contrary to Vulgar received Opinion above that of our Neighbours the  French  which is utterly incapable of producing any thing like Poetical Musick without the assistance of Ryme  The MONUMENT A POEM Sacred to the IMMORTAL MEMORY OF William the Third  VVHAT sudden Damp has seiz'd upon my Soul  Why are my Spirits chill'd my Nerves unbent  Why am I sad as is the mournful Grave  As if I never should know Comfort more  Sure conscious Nature gives Presage that Death  The Tyrant whom she most abhors draws near  Ah woe 'tis now too plain for a worse Death  Has happen'd than alas thou fondly thought'st  A Death in which the ruin'd World's concern'd  A Death attended with the Fate of Nations  Too plain alas I hear the doleful Sound  The Good the Great the Godlike  WILLIAM  's dead  Gone is his mighty Mind for ever flown  And nought but his Immortal Name remains  Gone is Great Providence's Watchful Viceroy  Gone the Great Soul that watch'd the Christian World  As the good faithful Shepherd does his Sheep  Against the Prowlings of the nightly Wolf  Who shall now guard us from the bloody Foe  Mourn then my Soul th' irreparable Loss  And with thee summon Human Kind to mourn  With them too summon even th' Immortal Powers  Thou first and chief forlorn  Britannia  mourn  And with thee let thy faithful Sons keep time  For thou and they and all have lost in him  A Champion Benefactor Father Friend  THOU next  Batavia  faln  Batavia  mourn  O let thy Eyes dissolve into a Stream  For thou hast lostO what hast thou not lost  Thy Bulwark thy Defence thy lofty Mound  That kept out lawless Arbitrary Pow'r  Which like the Ocean now surrounds thy Tow'rs  With dreadful Inundation threatn'ng all  EVROP A  Beautiful in sadness mourn  Thy Father thy Defender's from thee torn  And now the Lustful Bestial God once more  Has loudly threaten'd thee with shameful Rape  With thee let all thy Royal Sons lament  Those martial Sons that were with  WILLIAM  join'd  In the Great Cause of Godlike Liberty  Who shall your several Interests now unite  AND thou Celestial Charmer LIBERTY  Daughter of Wisdom and of Supreme  Jove  Sister of Reason and of Sovereign Law  Now Goddess beat thy beauteous Breasts and rend  The flowing Ringlets of thy golden Hair  To mourn thy Mighty Benefactor's Fate  For  WILLIAM  's Fate O Liberty was thine  Thou and Religion here have room no more  AND thou the darling Daughter of the Skies  Divine RELIGION thou whose melting Eyes  Have always like perpetual Fountains stream'd  To mourn th' Offences of a sinful World  O let them pour a Deluge now of Tears  To wail the dismal Consequence of Sin  To mourn Great  WILLIAM  's and thy Flight to Heav'n  He was thy Lover and thy best belov'd  He was thy Champion and thy sole Defence  Against the Tyrants both of Earth and Hell  His flaming Zeal O Goddess rouz'd thy Friends  His charming Accents gain'd thy very Foes  To fight O Goddess and to die for thee  AND ye O ANGELS and ARCHANGELS all  Guardians of mighty Kingdoms and of Kings  Who could your Cares on  WILLIAM  's Breast repose  Who could your several Charges all to him  Resign while happily aloft ye tower'd  And cut with golden Wings your blissful Heav'n  Now mourn his Flight to the pure Realms of Day  And mourn your own Return to a bad World  For he is to your upper Regions flown  Who equal to your selves your Cares below supply'd  THEN mourn O EARTH and mourn ye HEAVENS your Spheres  To Melting Airs y' Intelligences tune  His Godlike Soul's for ever from us flown  Whose Zeal could the divided Earth unite  Whose wond'rous Zeal united Earth and Heav'n  BUT let there be such Lamentation here  As ne'er was known for any Fate before  And let the Grief be general as the Loss  For Human Kind has lost by  WILLIAM  's Death  His People most his first and chiefest Care  He was the tender Father to his People  A Friend and Brother to the rest of Kings  Alas few Kings are Friends or meet with Friends  A Benefactor to the Race of Men  Sure 'twas some Angel who forsook the Skies  And out of wondrous Love to wretched Men  Vouchsaf 'd to dwell in Human Shape below  For all his Lifetime he from Place to Place  Remov'd dispensing Benefits to all  And from their Gates the grand Destroyer drove  For that alone he mov'd he spoke he thought  As if th' important Business of his Life  Had been to sacrifice his own Felicity  To that of wretched Men his Great Design  Extended to his most inveterate Foes  He blest ev'n them and would have done them good  Because his Foes were still his Fellow Creatures  From one Divine Original deriv'd  His Foes his Justice and his Mercy knew  And his inviolable Faith as firm  As are th' unchangeable Decrees of Fate  For tho the wondrous Goodness of his Soul  Made him still sympathize in all our Joys  And mourn and suffer in the Woes we feel  Tho He found something in his godlike Mind  That answer'd to the Cries of the Distress'd  And gave him Anguish till they found Relief  Which was the Source of all his wondrous Deeds  And which distinguish'd his Heroick Life  And set him far above all vulgar Heroes  Yet was his Word so sacred and so sure  He would not break it to preserve a World  BUT when your vulgar Heroes we survey  We find them the abhor'd Reverse of this  They by the Fever of Ambition fir'd  Run frantickly about the frighted World  And think to grow by mighty Mischiefs great  While Horror marches in their dreadful Van  And Death and Slaughter in their bloody Rear  Whole Towns they plunder lay whole Countries waste  With grinding Want they make vast Kingdoms pine  But their own Kingdoms into Deserts turn  Where Famine lords it in its wild Domain  For their own Kingdoms loudest cry to Heav'n  And loudest under their Oppression groan  If they make doubtful Peace or hollow Truce  'Tis but for time to wage more dangerous War  To weaken and divide their thoughtless Foes  And lull them by Security to Fate  To Friends deceitful faithless to Allies  Perfidious perjur'd to their inborn Slaves  Revengeful cruel bloody to Mankind  A Sea of guiltless Blood they spill a Sea  Of helpless Widows and of Orphans Tears  Destroy their Enemies their Subjects more  Their Subjects chiefly feel their barbarous Hands  For mad with Rage their Enemies they tear  But their poor Subjects coolly they destroy  O fruitless Labour of fantastick Pride  For while they thus would more than Men appear  Their Breach of Faith the Wrongs they do each Hour  Their hateful Violences make them less  Only by Fools and Impious Men admir'd  Abhor'd by God by all good Men despis'd  Too faithful Copies of their proud Original  The great Destroyer and the Foe of Men  The first and grand Artificer of Fraud  The pow'rful Prince of all th' infernal Pow'rs  Mighty to act sagacious to contrive  Who with capacious comprehensive thought  Sits brooding o'er his dark and damn'd Design  Of captivating all the Race of Men  And fixing Universal Monarchy  Which he sometimes with Violence and Rage  Sometimes with Lies and Hellborn Arts pursues  His Foes sometimes with open Force invades  But most with secret Practice undermines  And sows Dissensions to divide their Strength  A dreadful and a dangerous Foe to all  But sure Perdition to his fastest Friends  And his Allies are lost as are his Slaves  Who in Infernal Pains for ever howl  THUS earthly Heroes copy him of Hell  Those Tyrants whom the thoughtless World calls Heroes  Such was not happy  WILLIAM  but a Friend  To Men and Servant of the most Supreme  The chief and godlike Purpose of his Soul  Was the restoring Quiet Order Peace  And Universal Happiness to Men  And like a faithful Servant to advance  His Master's universal great Design  His Master would have all his Creatures blest  He loves the miserable Sons of Men  And with a Love so ardent and so high  As never can be thought be finite Man  Next his was  WILLIAM  's Love to all his Kind  For Fiends and Tyrants only were his Foes  And Tyrants he esteem'd no longer Men  As cursed Fiends are Angels now no more  Fal'n from their Natures and their Names by Pride  He hated both to both a mortal Foe  Because they dar'd t' impeach his godlike Purpose  For they make wretched all whom they make Slaves  For what can be so dismal as to see▪  Our Lives our Fortunes nay our ev'ry Action  Nay ev'n our Virtue and Divine Religion  All in a feverish frantick Tyrant's pow'r  And to his boundless Passions all expos'd  He look'd with Indignation and Disdain  Upon th' aspiring vain presumptuous Wretch  Who thought it great t'enslave his FellowCreatures  Dogs were not made to be control'd by Dogs  Nor Horses over Horses to insult  They rule not one another nor ought Man  To controul Man but God is to command  Who governs still by Reason and by Law  He loves the Sons of Men and leaves them free  As free as is his own Almighty Power  For he himself makes Reason still his Guide  And swerves not from his own Eternal Laws  Since our Great Maker then has left us free  On whom we so immediately depend  In whom we live and move and ev'n exist  Kings who are God's Vicegerents too must leave  Those who are under their Subjection free  And govern them by Reason and by Law  For tho like Gods they'r honour'd they are Men  And they must die like Men So  WILLIAM  rul'd  And look'd with Anger and with just Disdain  Upon the vain the mortal dying Wretch  Who dares to make them Slaves whom God makes free  Who by his lawless boundless Passions sways  And sacrifices to his Lust of Power  A thousand greater worthier than Himself  For such are all the Good and truly Wise  Which is renouncing Reason's sacred Rule  Subverting th' Awful Government of God  Deposing ev'n the World's Perpetual King  As far as lies within a Mortal's Power  T' assert the direful Government of Hell  For if good Kings are God's Vicegerents sure  A Tyrant is Hell's Viceroy and as such  A Christian's bound by his Baptismal Vow  Against him to denounce perpetual War  So  WILLIAM  did and seem'd design'd by Fate  T' assert the awful Government of God  And Liberty of Man and ne're did Heav'n  Nor Fate do more for mortal Man than Him  In giving him the Will to undertake  And Power to execute the vast Design  AND never was it known that mortal Man  More Noble more Heroick Deeds perform'd  Than  WILLIAM  in the Cause of God and Liberty▪  The glaring Actions which the World calls Great  From Passion chiefly not from Virtue flow  And of all Passions from Ambition most  Pride which such dangerous Ravage wrought in Heaven  Among th' Immortal Spirits of the Blest  May well destroy our frail Felicity  May well cause dreadful Revolutions here  To Pride th' Illustrious  Romans  ow'd their Fame  Their Quarrels still were specious seldom just  Yet not the greatest first of  Romans Caesar  Darling of Story Paramour of Fame  Of whom she doting talks and ne're is tir'd  To satisfy Ambition e're perform'd  Deeds which display'd such Greatness in the Man  As what Great  WILLIAM  did for Liberty  METHINKS ye Friends to Arbitrary Sway  At this great Paradox I see you smile  But hear ye wretched Slaves t' Opinion hear  And then determine this important Cause  CAESAR  acquir'd his greatest Share of Fame  Against the  Gauls  who were our  WILLIAM  's Foes  But  Caesar  fought with them divided weak  Doubtful in Counsel and in Action slow  False to each other Traitors to themselves  And the great Cause of dying Liberty  No Captain at their Head like mighty  Coesar  Vers'd in the Noble Science of the Field  The dexterous Art of Fortifying Camps  Or Ranging numerous Armies in Array  No brave experienc'd Officers to form  Their Troops undisciplin'd and rude to War  Their Soldiers and Commanders all grown faint  Dejected spiritless with frequent Routs  All dead and senseless to that Noble Fire  That to Illustrious Acts inflames the Brave  UNDER these Disadvantages lay  France  In what Condition was great  Caesar  then  Mature in Years by long Experience Wise  Awful for Eloquence and Martial Deeds  Leading the Flow'r of  Rome  's Victorious Legions  Back'd and supported by the Conquer'd World  Valiant his Soldiers Skilful Disciplin'd  Experienc'd their Commanders Wise and Brave  And Soldiers and Commanders  Romans  all  Inur'd to Dangers made by Custom bold  Exalted spirited with long Success  All eager in the burning Chase of Fame  All faithful and united under  Caesar  And He Supreme and Absolute o're all  Yet with all these Advantages Great  Caesar  Ten tedious Years consum'd in Conquering  France  And now the Glory of his Conquest shares  If the Distributors of Fame are just  With his Wise Valiant his Victorious Friends  Nay and with Fortune with his very Foes  For False and Traitors to the Common Cause  Their Country basely they betray'd and sold  WE 've shewn what  Caesar  did for Pride behold  What  VVILLIAM  for Fair Liberty perform'd  And th' Actions in an equal Balance lay  'TWAS in the fatal and recorded Year  In which  Batavia  the Defence and Mound▪  Of Faith of Right of sinking Liberty  Batavia  like the native Land of  Jove  Proud of a hundred Formidable Towns  Whose Lofty Bulwarks and whose Stately Tow'rs  Are to the Storms of Arbitrary Pow'r  What its Digues are to the Tempestuous Main  For the wild roaring Torrent they restrain  Which else would deluge all the Christian World  And leave the Earth depopulate and bare  'Twas in the Year in which forlorn  Batavia  Invaded was defenceless and surpriz'd  And by two potent Enemies attack'd  Britannia  thundring on them from the Main  And faithless  Gallia  lightning on the Shore  While at the Horror of the Noise and Sight  The  Belgick  Lion trembling and aghast  Faint in his Roar and with unsinew'd Paws  Flew for Protection to the stormy Main  Whose unrelenting Rage he most abhors  'Twas in that fatal Year in which the States  Their Country lost to the insulting  French  Their strongest Bulwarks forc'd or else betray'd  Were turn'd irresolute distracted wild  The Croud desponding all divided faint  Astonish'd and amaz'd and stupid grown  In dreadful expectation of their Fate  'Twas at this fatal Juncture that the Prince  Like th' Offspring of the Gods a Hero born  Without th' advantage of a long Experience  Without the influence of an awful Fame  Without courageous or instructed Troops  With nought on which he could depend but Heav'n  His vast Capacity and dauntless Soul  Magnanimously undertook to save  His sinking Country and expiring Liberty  HERE I'm in Rapture and Amazement lost  What shall I first admire his dauntless Soul  In that amazing Hurricane of Fate  E'er scarce the Bloom of Youth proclaim'd him Man  When all the Heav'ns look'd black and all the Main  Look'd dismal when the frantick Billows rag'd  The Tempest roar'd the forky Thunder roll'd  And loudly bellow'd o'er the dreadful▪ Deep  The skilful'st Mariners confounded foil'd  The boldest trembling dying with the Fright  The sinking Vessel motionless and dead  Those at the Helm desponding desperate  Abandoning to Winds and Waves their Care  He who had never plough'd the Deep before  Alone unterrify'd and undismay'd  And dauntless in that dangerous Extreme  As is a God by destiny secur'd  As is the God of the tempestuous Deep  When in some Storm that threatens general Wrack  He lifts above the Waves his sacred Head  To calm his troubled Empire of the Main  And give the lab'ring Universe Repose  OR his great Conduct shall I first admire  Without th' advantage of Experience wise  Exact profound unfathomably deep  Design'd him by Foreknowledg giv'n by Fate  To countermine the dark Designs of Hell  CAN ye behold Him ye ungenerous Foes  To his Great Memory his Deathless Name  Without extolling to the Stars his Fame  When ye discern him in that dreadful Hour  Appearing at the Head of shameful Troops  A wretched Handful antiquated most  Rusty with Peace and listless with Disuse  The rest a vile tumultuous Crowd in haste  By sad Necessity not Choice enroll'd  Rude and untaught and barbarous to War  Unfit by Nature and untrain'd by Art  By num'rous ill Successes abject made  Dejected drooping infamously base  The mere Reverse of all that's Great and Brave  Their Leaders the base Scum of all the rest  And for that only reason uppermost  Rais'd by the boiling Ferment of the State  Only for factious Discontent advanc'd  And inbred Hatred to their Great Defender  Can you behold him at the Head of these  Informing moving animating all  Changing their very Natures like a God  His Bravery kindling thousands with its Fire  His Spirit working like the World's Great Soul  And spreading beauteous Order thro them where  Trouble Confusion Chaos reign'd before  Can you see this and not be wrapt with Wonder  Can you behold the conqu'ring  Gauls  at  Bay  Already on his first Appearance stopt  In their precipitated wild Career  Already meditating their Retreat  Can ev'n his most inveterate Foes see this  And not exalt such wond'rous Worth to Heav'n  WHAT a Man is to hearten fainting Hounds  To rouze their Vigour on the lifeless Chase  And guide them through the Mazes of the Field  That to his drooping Countrymen was He  Something between Divinity and them  A more Exalted a Superiour Being  Their Guardian Genius and their God of War  His vast Capacity supply'd their Heads  His martial Bravery inflam'd their Hearts  And rais'd their abject and their grov'ling Souls  To Noble Thoughts and to Immortal Deeds  Above the Fear of Death or foul Retreat  So  Pallas  to the fainting  Greeks  appear'd  Shook her invincible her dreadful Shield  And spread Celestial Vigour thro the Field  BEHOLD him by a Conduct which surpriz'd  The most Illustrious and the Oldest Chiefs  The most experienc'd in the Art of War  Like the young  Roman  Hero so renown'd  Forsaking his poor Country to preserve it  And save the sinking Freedom of the World  Behold upon fair  Bona  's lofty Tow'rs  The Guardian Angels of a hundred Forts  A hundred Towns sit gazing to receive  And with loud Welcomes hail their Great Defender  For  Bona  taken set  Batavia  free  And rent in twain th' opprobrious Bonds prepar'd  To bind the Christian World yet under Heav'n  That favour'd him with such peculiar Grace  He ows th' Immortal Glory to Himself  Not to the Valour of his fainting Troops  Nor to the Skill of their unwarlike Leaders  Their Bravery was his for he inspir'd it  And his their Conduct which from him they drew  Nor ows his Fame to Weakness of his Foes  Or their Divisions or their Want of Skill  But the Profoundness of his vast Designs  And his High Courage rais'd above Compare  THE  Gauls  had all th' advantage o'er  Nassau  That  Cesar  manifestly had o'er  Gaul  Behold them strong united numberless  Their warlike Chiefs experienc'd and renown'd  Their wellprovided Squadrons skilful brave  All flush'd and spirited with long Success  All eager in the burning Chase of Glory  Yet  WILLIAM  at the Head of wretched Troops  Wretched at least till rais'd and fir'd by Him  In little more than one revolving Year  Forc'd his dread Foes to leave his Country free  When  Caesar  with the Flow'r of  Roman  Legions  In the large Compass of Ten rolling Years  Scarce conquer'd barbarous divided  Gaul  EV'N Fortune claims no share in his Renown  Fortune that bears so visible a part  In Human Actions ruling all below  Which Providence has wisely order'd lest  Frail Dust should grow intolerably vain  And cry upon Success 'Tis due to me  But he so highly favour'd was of Heav'n  That still He brought about his vast Designs  While she was known t' assist his mortal Foes  The great Discerner of all Human Hearts  Knew that his Noble Soul was truly Great  As far above presumptuous Pride as Fear  So conscious of its Origin Divine  It ne'er could ought but its Great Maker fear  Ne'er own a Man superior to it self  But then so mindful of its frail Condition  And its Creator's high Omnipotence  That its Dependance it could ne'er forget  That him it would with trembling still approach  And with profound Humility adore  And by that Lowliness and aweful Fear  Confirm its Greatness and its dauntless Courage  THUS Fortune and the  Gauls  were  WILLIAM  's Foes  Both He resisted and He conquer'd both  And brought about his great and just Designs  But cruel was the Conflict first and long  And oft the Goddess seemingly prevail'd  And oft at once collecting her whole Might  Took all Advantages of Time and Place  Prepar'd to crush him at a blow when He  With wondrous Art eludes that dreadful Blow  And with fresh Force disputes the doubtful Day  While Heav'n serene look'd down with all its Eyes  Charm'd with the greatest noblest Sight that Earth  Can offer to the Skies and that's a Man  A mortal Man a Match for Fortune's Pow'r  Her Pow'r great Arbitress of all below  Till his Invincible unshaken Soul  With Wisdom Patience Resignation arm'd  And with a thousand Virtues that have Force  To conquer Gods compell'd her to submit  And own her glorious Conqueror at the last  NOR were her Smiles more pow'rful o'er his Soul  For upon him the faithless Goddess smil'd  Ev'n in the worst of Times that dreadful Hour  When raving as a  Bacchanal  and wild  She to new Slaughter lash'd on limping Fate  And led the  Gauls  t' extirpate lost  Batavia  She offer'd him a Kingdom for a Bribe  A Kingdom with a hundred pow'rful Towns  In Wealth exhaustless numberless in Men  Which he rejected with a Brave Disdain  And chose to perish with his Country free  Rather than found an Empire on its Bonds  O Greatness to be found on Earth no more  Exalted far above all Royalty  And far above the Rule of Fortune's Pow'r  For when long after he embrac'd a Crown  Justly confer'd by free Consent of those  O'er whom He was to reign th' Acceptance them  Was necessary for the World not Him  And for the World H' embrac'd it not himself  To him 'twas all Increase of Toil and Care  He wanted not a Crown to make him Great  His Soul possess'd a Greatness of its own  Not like the shortliv'd Pomp of Fortunes Pow'r  But durable Immortal as it self  Plac'd like it self above the Force of Fate  His Towring Soul it self was Greatness all  All vast Intelligence and solid Virtue  The things which make ev'n God and Angels Great  A FALSE and borrow'd Lustre He despis'd  Deriv'd from Scepters and Imperial Crowns  His Soul with native Lustre native Flame  Shone out as glorious as th' Eternal Fire  Which rolls his Sovereign Globe along the Sphere  Rapid yet firm in the Refulgent Course  That the Great Mover taught him at the first  And whose Excess of Glory darkens all  The rest of God's Vicegerents in the Skies  Thus while vain Pomp and tinsel Glory serve  T' amuse the gazing and inconstant Crowd  He charm'd the bravest wisest Men on Earth  Angels look'd wondring on his Virtue down  And the Great Maker pleas'd his MasterPiece survey'd  THUS He despising Royalty acquir'd  A more extended and a Nobler Power  Imperial Crowns who saw to what a Height  Above all Human Greatness He was rais'd  How far above all little selfish Thoughts  Acting as if he thought he had been born  For all the World except himself alone  Anxious about the Safety of the World  But utterly regardless of his own  And hazarding his own for that of all  Imperial Crowns convinc'd of this confest  An Excellence superior to their own  And Kings themselves grew subject to his Sway  Him with Esteem and Wonder they beheld  Champion of God and his most Sacred Truth  Defender of the Liberties of Men  And Great Protector of the Rights of Kings  And they who gave to mighty Nations Laws  Receiv'd them first from him and justly thought  That only He who of Mankind took care  By Nature was design'd the Lord of All  What but the Head takes care of every Part  What but the Soul What but th' informing Soul  What runs thro all that animates them all  And in continuous Union all maintains  Union their Cause of Spirit Health and Force  And which dissolv'd to all brings Fate or Woe  NOW He the Councils of those Kings collects  And all their different Interests reconciles  Of all their thwarting selfish low Designs  One Common Noble Vast Design he makes  That seem'd impossible to all but Him  But his rare Genius sure Expedients finds  To calm their Jealousies and sooth their Pride  And all at least are satisfied in him  The Tie and Bond of Union to them all  And now behold him marching at the Head  Of all their Squadrons  German Spanish Dutch  Now see them filing thro thy narrow Ways  Till then inglorious and obscure  Seneffe  Now shining in the bright Records of Fame▪  Among the Glories of th' Eternal Roll  And lo the  Germans  and the  Dutch  have pass'd  And the Proud  Spaniard  now prepares to pass  When lo Great  Conde  with his headlong Troops  Comes pouring on them like a sounding Flood  That by Destruction makes its noisy Way  Upon the Wings of Fear the  Spaniards  fly  And many a Furlong leave their Pride behind  For  Conde  's Image haunts them in their Flight  His awful Form still urging on their Speed  More dreadful to them than his Numerous Host  His awful Form presented to their View  To their Remembrance calls his glorious Acts  Their Friends defeated and Themselves o'rethrown  When e're Great  Conde  's Image they behold  The bloody Plains of  Lens  are in their View  And thou O  Friburg  with thy dismal Cliffs  And the dire Fields of  Norlingue  and  Rocroy  A thousand Victories and High Exploits  Encompass him with dreadful Glory round  About him like a Guard of Terrors march  And arm him with Eternal Majesty  These Fantoms goad the  Spaniards  in their Flight  And now the Fury of that shameful Flight  Proves fatal to the Forces of their Friends  And the Battalions breaks and overwhelms  That  WILLIAM  swiftly sends to their Relief  The  French  drive on and no Resistance find  Or else Triumphant force their way through all  Outragious as a Flame that's driv'n by Winds  And fiercer stronger by Obstruction grown  But now Heroick  WILLIAM  thund'ring comes  To turn the Fortune of the bloody Day  Behold with what a NobleRage h' attempts  T' arrest his Squadrons in their headlong Flight  For his own Squadrons first He's sorc'd t' attack  With what a matchless Bravery he meets  Routed Battalions panting or'e the Plain  Then with his flaming Sword in their Career  He stands his Person to them all expos'd  His Thundring Arm opposing to them all  Now by the Torrent overborn o'erwhelm'd  Now stemming with a dauntless Breast the Tide  And now with desperate Vehemence turning all  The Base with Blows corrects with Words the Brave  And some the sparkling Glories of his Eye  And some his Looks and some his Voice inflames  O whither run ye O return return  O ye who had the Looks of Soldiers once  I see ye always had the Hearts of Slaves  The worst of Slaves from Slaves themselves ye run  You Cowards in defending Liberty  They in augmenting their own Thraldom Brave  For me my own right Hand or else my Foes  My Freedom and my Glory shall secure  For Death or Victory bring both alike  Ye few Great Souls who Liberty and Fame  Prefer to wretched shameful slavish Life  Come on be  Death  or  Victory  the Word  THIS said he breathing an Heroick Air  As great as if Eternal Fame appear'd  And to High Actions call'd her darling Sons  And now their Shame prevails upon their Fear  And now he leads them furious to the Charge  Firmly resolv'd to die a thousand Deaths  And to forsake the World e'er such a Leader  Now at their Head with a resistless Rage  He thro the firmest  French  Battalions breaks  And charging thro and thro their Squadrons mows  Their Squadrons now conceal'd in smoaky Clouds  And now reveal'd in blazing Sheets of Fire  And now the  French  grow fiercer by Despair  And with redoubled Voice  Bellona  raves  With shriller Notes the Cornets vex the Air  Death's Bugles in the dismal Chase of Blood  The Trumpets kindle  Mars  with fiercer Sounds  And the tempestuous Drums with thicker Stroaks  Alarm the Foe of Nature All the Heavens  And all the Air appears conflicting Fire  And now the joining Squadrons rend the Skies  And riding at full Stretch upon the Plain  With hideous Outcries on each other rush  And make one ghastful Charnel of the Field  The ratling Plain with murdring Vollies rings  And to the thundring Cannons mortal roar  The Hills rebellow with a dreadful Sound  That the dire Consort seems to deaf the World  WILLIAM  the glorious Spirit of the War  Is every where where Danger most prevails  Correcting Fortune and confronting Fate  Like  Mars  himself Fierce Valiant Raging Young  Among the thickest Foes his thundring Steed  He spurs then brandishes his fatal Sword  Terror severely sparkling in his Eyes  Death like a Faulcon perch'd upon his Arm  Watching the certain Signal of his Blow  And then like Lightning darting at his Prey  WILLIAM  the desperat'st Champion of the Field  In Feats of Arms and mortal Rage excels  Surpassing in amazing Actions all  Whom Glory urges or whom dire Despair  The meanest Sentry less expos'd than he  Frequent amidst the hottest of the Fire  And oft surrounded cover'd o're with Flames  And yet in Conduct oldest Chiefs excels  To best Advantage ev'ry Motion makes  Always exactly present to himself  Spite of his furious executing Arm  Spite of the Smoak the Tumult and the Noise  The raging Trumpet and the storming Drum  The Musquets Din and thundring Cannons Roar  Nay spite of Death whom all his dreadful Guard  Of purple Terrors through the Field attends  Who painting hideously his ghastful Face  With Dust and Blood and leaping his pale Steed  O're slaughter'd Heaps rides dismal thro the Plain  THUS all the Day the God of Battel rag'd  And the Sun sat in Horror and in Blood  And then the lab'ring Moon beheld a Sight  That troubled her above  Thessalian  Charms  And made old Night look hideous to her View  NOW in their turns the mangled  French  recoil  And doubt the Fortune of the dreadful Day  And well they may recoil and well may doubt  When their Great Chief th' Heroick  Conde  doubts  Now Rage Disdain and Grief to Madness wrought  And the tormenting Conscience of his Worth  Disturb his Generous Breast and wrack his Soul  He raves He cannot bear the stabbing Thought  Of yielding to a beardless Chief the Field  But this is what torments and stings him most  That He who now for thirty Glorious Years  Has with successive Victories been crown'd  Been us'd to all the Wonders of the Field  Himself the Noblest Wonder of them all  Should see this Godlike Youth perform such things  As force ev'n him t' admire O mortal Shame  He crys aloud O Death to my Renown  'Twas He 'tis manifest 'twas none but He  That turn'd the Fortune of the Wondrous Day  Thou my Divinity Eternal Fame  And Victory thou Darling of my Soul  My Mistress that for Thirty Glorious Years  Hast still been constant to my Noble Fire  Will ye desert me for a Boy at last  Is not my Deathless Passion still the same  Is not my Great Aspiring Soul the same  The same my Conduct and my Nervous Arm  Have I for  Nassau  courted you thus long  For him were all the desperate Fields I fought  For him my accumulated Triumphs all  Which with my Loss of Quiet and of Blood  With Restless Days and Sleepless Nights I won  O never never let it be pronounc'd  First let me perish let me perish all  The very Name of  Conde  be forgot  Be the curst Syllables ne're mention'd more  And ye vain Monuments of my Renown  Lens Norlingue Friburg St Antoine Rocroy  O let  Seneffe  compleat th' Illustrious List  Or may ye all neglected be by Fame  And never shine in her Eternal Roll  THIS said He leads the  French  to certain Fate  For now th' Allies Invincible are grown  Dauntless their Minds Impregnable their Posts  Such is their Hero's Conduct and his Fire  And now they pour a Storm of Iron Hail  Whose Fury makes whole Squadrons fall while they  Cover'd with Dust and horrid all with Blood  The slaughter'd  French  in Ghastful Heaps behold  And take new Spirit from that dismal Sight  Conde  resolves his Men shall perish all  Resolves himself to perish at their Head  And all had fal'n a Victim to Despair  If the descending Goddess of the Night  Had not just then withdrawn her Sickly Beams  And Night her blackest Mantle o're them thrown  And now the Rage and Din of Battel cease  Nor Noise nor Silence in the Field prevails  But a low hoarse and undistinguish'd Sound  A sullen hollow grumbling strikes their Ears  The dreadful Murmurs of declining Rage  And the last doleful Accents of Despair  And now the  Freneh  conceal'd in Night retire  And to Victorious  WILLIAM  leave the Field  And in the Height of Anguish and Despair  Praise his great Conduct and his matchless Fire  HERE meanly his ungenerous Foes enquire  Were all his Battels thus with Conquest crown'd  What if they were not they deserv'd it all  And that was more than Victory to him  He nobly chose to merit Victory  Rather than have it poorly undeserv'd  And from the Height of his exalted Soul  Descend to Triumph by inglorious Ways  Greater and more exalted in Distress  Than the great Monarch in his happier Hours  Looking with Scorn on Fortune and his Foes  And all who prosper'd by ignoble Arts  His Conquests all were Glorious all were Just  All fairly gain'd in the broad Eye of Heav'n  And gain'd while Heav'n and Earth look'd wondring on  Conquests indeed not Robberies nor Fraud  Nor Purchases nor Thefts a Conqueror he  No Trafficker for Countries and for Towns  Nor double Dealer in the Trade of War  Nor sordid Turner of his Gold for Gain  He conquer'd at  Seneffe  had 'ere his Foes  A braver Army or a nobler Chief  A Chief with such Experience such Renown  And so much Conduct join'd with so much Fire  So wondrous when the God of Battel rag'd  He who against great  Conde  found Success  Could ne're have miss'd it against meaner Chiefs  Had he not by their Numbers been opprest  Or by the Falseness of his own betray'd  For to himself he always ow'd Success  To his high Conduct and his great Example  His Losses to the Falshood or the Sloth  Or Impotence or Factions of his Friends  But yet whene're he lost th' incertain Day  He lost but what was Fortune's not his own  The towring Greatness of his Soul was His  And that he never lost that was Himself  His very self his Troops have been subdu'd  But never He He gain'd by their Defeat  Since adverse Fortune shew'd him more himself  Of deeper Conduct and more towring Mind  More watchful Care and more unwearied Toil  Of Resolution never to be broke  Of Constancy that triumph'd over Fate  And kept Proud Fortune in severest Awe  'Twas this that terrify'd his happier Foes  Made  Lewis  in the Fields of  Valenciennes  Poorly the Glorious proffer'd Fight refuse  Afraid to trust his far more numerous Troops  More Skilful more Victorious more Renown'd  Doubting if they with Fortune's stronger Power  Could guard him all from  WILLIAM  's great Revenge  This made the Proud and Haughty Monarch stoop  And after all th' Advantages he gain'd  With Prudence doubt the last Event of War  And in our Hero's Country sue for Peace  AND now the World in faithless Peace lies lul'd  Which more than War advances boundless Sway  Fair Liberty sleeps on and never dreams  That to her Heart her Murderer's Hand's so near  Till 'tis too late to fear too late to dream  For now they seize and bind Her strongest Friend  That they may surely give the fatal Blow  Now the Crowns totter on a hundred Heads  And  Europe  's nodding Powers expect to fall  For lo where bound forlorn  Britannia  lies  Pinion'd her Arms that once the Balance held  And in due Poise sustain'd the pond'rous World  Bound to her Rocks like  Andromede  she lies  Fair Liberty shreeks out aloud for Aid  When  WILLIAM  on the Wings of all the Winds  Like  Perseus  nobly to their Rescue flies  While the admiring World attentive stands  Trembling in Expectation of th' Event  For  WILLIAM  's Fate the General Fate decides  When with Success above what  Caesar  found  But  Caesar  came t' enslave and He to free  The Happy Hero came and conquer'd e're he saw  O CONQUEST worthy Men and Angels praise  How poor's the Triumph for extended Sway  Compar'd to this This Conquest over Hearts  This Triumph over Souls which leaves them free  And makes the Vanquish'd happier than the Victors  The  Britons  who were wretched Slaves before  Who 'ad lost ev'n Hope and who expected nought  But Life in Miseries or Death in Flames  When he approach'd grew Happy Free Secure  So Happy that their Raptures knew no Bounds  For hark how their tumultuous Joy grows loud  Hark how their stormy Shouts ascend the Skies  To unknown Worlds transporting  VVILLIAM  's Fame  Still still the Sounds are in my ravish'd Ears  And still methinks I hear the Nation's cry  Hail thou Defender of unspotted Faith  Renown'd Restorer of lost Freedom hail  Great Patron of the Christian World all hail  At thy Approach fierce Arbitrary Power  And bloody Superstition disappear  At thy Approach fair Liberty returns  And smiling darts a lovely Glance so sweet  As charms at once the Hearts of Gods and Men  While Piety looks modestly assur'd  And lifts its moving melting Eyes to Heaven  O Happy Happy above Millions Thou  Who hast made Millions blest Thee Times to come  Thee Nations yet unborn shall Happy call  For the diffusive Good which flows from Thee  To ev'ry Age and Nation must extend  But we th' ungrateful'st and the worst of Men  Should we e'er cease to celebrate thy Praise  Should we forget the boundless Debt we owe  Then raise thy Voice O Happy Island raise  Let thy tempestuous Raptures tow'r to Heaven  Till Angels catch our Great Deliverer's Praise  Tune it ye Angels to your deathless Lyres  And let all Heaven attend th' enchanting Song  For ye have Voices for the lofty Theme  Ye Angels an Immortal Glorious Crown  To recompense th' Immortal Act prepare  But may he wear it late and long be ours  May ye impatiently expect him long  Long may he deign to wear this earthly Crown  Which now we place upon his Sacred Head  A poor and mean Return for what we owe  THIS was th' assembled Nation's general Sense  In these warm Sounds they 'xpress'd their Gratitude  And pleas'd the Godlike Hero with their Joy  Yet scarce the inconstant Moon renew'd her Orb  O may it never mention'd be by Fame  Or never be believ'd by Times to come  Before they chang'd their more inconstant Minds  And murmur'd at their Great Deliverer  Some envied ev'n the Crown they had bestow'd  And some regretting their old Thraldom cry'd  For  Egypt  and its Vegetable Gods  Others would be preserv'd but not by Him  Alas unfortunate mistaken Men  Who could preserve you possibly but He  Hark how  Hibernia  rends with Shreeks the Air  And to  Britannia  cries aloud for Help  In vain Great  Schomberg  marches to her Aid  With his Brave Officers his dauntless Troops  With his own wondrous Skill in Feats of Arms  For Superstition and wild lawless Power  Stood both insulting by and saw those Troops  Consum'd insensibly without a Blow  But  VVILLIAM  's Presence on the wondring  Boyn  Made his Foes tremble cheer'd his fainting Friends  Reviv'd them like their Universal Soul  And quickly chang'd that hapless Island's Fate  As when the Sun above th' Horizon mounts  And with his Blaze of Glory fills the World  Goblins and Ghosts obscene and Spirits damn'd  That revel'd by the Stars uncertain Light  Or the pale Glimpses of the Silver Moon  Revere th' Effulgence of the Lord of Day  And disappearing take their Flight to Hell  So when the Light of all the Christian World  Mounted in Glory o'er the Banks of  Boyn  Unbounded Pow'r soon took its headlong Flight  And frighted Superstition quickly shrunk  Its hated Head within its gloomy Cell  Hibernia  rescued by her Martial King  Made thee  Britannia  more securely free  Why dost thou murmur then ungrateful Isle  What dost thou envy to the Best of Kings  That Happiness which waits upon a Crown  That thou thy self so freely hast bestow'd  So justly fix'd upon his Sacred Head  Is that thy Cause of envious Discontent  Alas the Happiness is all for Thee  And all the Toil and Misery for him  For thee and not Himself He wears that Crown  The very best of Fathers and of Kings  Contentedly supports a wretched Life  That He may make his muchlov'd Children blest  For  William  in his Kingdoms is Himself  The only Man whom his Auspicious Reign  Constrains to bear intolerable Care  Not all the Rolls of Fame can shew a King  Who labour'd under such a Weight before  Abroad behold a formidable Foe  Surpassing in his Numbers and his Strength  The whole Alliance which our Hero form'd  Then that Alliance difficult to form  And wondrous difficult to be maintain'd  Some Weak some Slow some Jealous Factious all  And thwarting in their contrary Designs  He was the only Man upon the Globe  Who could at once resist the Common Foe  And could enforce the Weakness of his Friends  Quicken their Sloth enrich their Poverty  Cool their Mistrusts their Factions reconcile  At the same time at home amongst his own  Lurk'd his most mortal and most dangerous Foes  Those Sons of Darkness who conceal'd in Night  Sat brooding o'er their damnable Design  To take away the very Life of Liberty  In the mean while his faithful'st Friends at home  His loyal'st Subjects too divided were  Too factious grown to take just care of Him  More eager most each other to destroy  Than Him their common Safety to defend  How few alas he found entirely true  How few in whom he could entirely trust  Upon whose faithful Breasts he could discharge  Some part of his intolerable Load  For some had groundless Jealousies conceiv'd  And others of themselves had too much care  To be sollicitous about their King  Never had Prince such Hardships to surpass  For in eternal Toil He past his Hours  Wasted with Action or consum'd with Thought  And twenty times He past the Stormy Main  While We in Peace securely slept at home  Past it against his Health against his Life  Past it for Us against his very Self  'Tis what his tender Body ne'r could bear  In ev'ry Passage he almost expir'd  Profuse of his inestimable Life  To save and to defend ungrateful Men  And when the wearying Toils of hard Campagns  Were overcome alas He came not home  Like other Conqu'rors t' indulge Himself  In soft repose or to enjoy the Fame  Or the fair Conscience of his Noble Acts  For always He return'd to endure new Toils  And bear almost insufferable Pains  Contending with the envious Rage of some  The causeless groundless Jealousies of more  And with the fierce Divisions of us all  And when with Godlike Patience he had born  Beyond what Nature suffer'd him to bear  The weary Marches and the hard Fatigues  Of a laborious and a long Campagn  At his return he always something found  More difficult and grievous to be born  Unjust Reproaches undeserv'd Affronts  From those whom with the hazard of his Life  Whom with the loss of Rest and Health he serv'd  And yet with Patience He supported all  Because He knew his Just Resentment shewn  Would have confounded all his Great Designs  Therefore that just Resentment pent within  Like a devouring Flame that wants a Vent  Consum'd and prey'd upon his Noble Heart  Exhausting the best Spirits of his Blood  And richest Purple of the Royal Flood  BEHOLD Him and then murmur if thou canst  O thou Repining and Ungrateful Tribe  Lab'ring beneath this Weight this World of Care  Which his frail Body could endure no more  He knew it yet undauntedly went on  Devoting his Inestimable Life  And off'ring his Heartsblood a Sacrifice  For the Felicity of wretched Men  Firmly resolv'd as far as fleeting Life  Would give him leave in spite of e'en our selves  And all our foolish and our factious Rage  To finish the great Work He had begun  IN this the  Roman Decii  He surpass'd  They for their Country too themselves devov'd  But what they did was probably th' effect  Of wild Enthusiasm and of frantick Rage  And sudden the Resolve and short the Pain  But  WILLIAM  's Action was th' effect of Thought  Of a deliberate and long Design  For sensibly his Life consum'd away  And sunk beneath the Pressure of Affairs  Yet He with indefatigable Soul  And with almost Divine Resolve went on  And knowing He or Liberty must die  By his eternal Care eternal Toil  To support that exhausted his Best Blood  And sav'd it at th' expence of ev'n his Life  AND if Success O fond mistaken Men  That judg of Human Actions by Success  Was sometimes wanting to his Great Designs  Yet he deserv'd it still and that's enough  And greatest when he miss'd it still was found  For then his firm and comprehensive Soul  In all the Lustre of its Virtue shone  Yet he's unjustly said to want Success  Who by his matchless Conduct in despite  Of Fortune's Favour ruin'd his great Foe  And near Perfection brought his own Designs  In spite of Losses made his Kingdom thrive  While  France  with all its Fortune was undone  For by Himself and not by Fortune Great  Great  WILLIAM  found us wretched left us blest  In spite of all her Malice all her Rage  But ill that King deserves the Name of Great  Who found his Subjects wealthy easy blest  And will be sure to leave them poor starv'd curst  In spite of false Success and false Renown  AND thus to bless Mankind our Hero liv'd  'Twas the sole Business of his Godlike Life  And great Employment of his dying Hours  He knew he ne'er could better die imploy'd  Than He had liv'd he knew the very Best  The Greatest Holiest of Mankind were they  Who of their Maker most resemblance bear  And that they best resemble the most High  Who to Mankind do most diffusive good  And who for future Ages best provide  Nor could the King of Terror's awful Face  Turn his Attention from his Grand Design  The grizly King no Terrors had for Him  Calmly they met and kindly they embrac'd  As friendly Monarchs on their Frontiers meet  His mighty Soul was so remote from Fear  That He shew'd nothing like what's falsely Brave  And nothing like what's falsely Good He show'd  No earnest vehement Devotion paid  Th' effect of Terror and Astonishment  But calm resign'd and charitably meek  Briefly and mildly offer'd up that Soul  To the Great Judg of Kings who knew his Heart  And the main Spring of all his Actions saw  That done again he of the World took care  For his Religion in his Actions lay  And not in fruitless Words and empty Sounds  He look'd upon himself as sent by God  T' advance the Happiness of Human Kind  And as He past his whole Heroick Life  He dy'd performing his Great Master's Will  And as He knew no Fear so Pain it self  Could not divert him from his Great Design  If we give Credit to the Sons of Art  His latest Hours in sharpest Pains were spent  And yet he shew'd no smallest Sign of Pain  Utter'd no loud Complaint nor piercing Groan  No Mark of Torment on his Face appear'd  Only a more compassionating Look  For his lov'd People whom he left behind  The best of Fathers for his Children felt  But for himself appear'd insensible  Yet his no fruitless vain Compassion was  But made him eager to compleat those Acts  That dire impending Mischiefs might prevent  And might our future Happiness secure  O GREATNESS never known to Man before  Too great to be conceiv'd by Human Thought  Behold a Man who dies in sharpest Pain  In his own Height of Misery intent  Upon providing Happiness for all  Which makes the sole Imployment of a God  In perfect Ease and full Felicity  As much concern'd for the World's Liberty  As if his Business ceas'd not with his Life  As if our Guardian Angel had assum'd  That Royal Shape and would not leave his Charge  But only disappear to Mortal Eyes  NOT the least Trouble or Concern He shew'd  That his Great Maker call'd him at a Time  When the expecting World had all its Eyes  Intent on Him the Darling Theme of Fame  When all his vast Designs were just reduc'd  Within a certain Prospect of Success  When humbled  Gaul  and the deliver'd World  Had all advanc'd his Fame to such a height  As never Human Glory rose before  Not in the least concern'd at being snatch'd  From the transporting Joy the vast Applause▪  Of all the Nations happy made by Him  The Hero meekly bore it tho He knew  That the World judges by the last Event  But the World's Praise was what he could contemn  He like a faithful Servant had perform'd  What his Great Master destin'd him to do  And so dy'd pleas'd with this Heroick Thought  That had that Master's absolute Decree  Allotted him a thousand times as much  He would with Cheerfulness have done it all  OF all about him in that dreadful Hour  He was alone serene the mournful rest  Felt all the fiercest Pangs of Grief and Fear  Of ghastful Horror and of wild Despair  Their bloodshot Eyes and their distracted Looks  Declar'd the inward Torments of their Souls  They all like Wretches on the Rack appear'd  Like the compassionate Spectator He  At last one hearty Sigh he gives for all  A Sigh that ended his Heroick Toils  And brought that Rest which Virtue could not bring  And now in loud and lamentable Wails  They vent their lawless Grief that knows no Bounds  Some for their Royal Patron wring their Hands  Their Benefactor some aloud deplore  Some their Wise Brave Undaunted General  Their Great Deliverer and Defender some  Their Father like poor helpless Orphans all  But turn thy View my Soul from that vast Grief  Whose mortal Prospect is enough to blast  Thy strongest and thy noblest Faculties  Yet whither must I fly t' avoid that Grief  All  Europe  catches the contagious Woe  The Greatest Men on Earth his Fate deplore  Those dauntless Souls who always scorn'd their own  Kings for that Loss not only grieve but die  But cease your Lamentations O ye Kings  Your loud Laments y' afflicted Nations cease  'Tis for your selves this vast Excess of Woe  And not for Him for He is surely blest  Never a greater Subject was of Woe  But still excessive Grief some Weakness shews  But lofty Praise declares a Noble Mind  The best Return for mighty Benefits  And worthy to be offer'd up to Gods  And to good Kings who most resemble Gods  Then change your Voices all with one accord  Y' afflicted Nations change your mournful Notes  And praise your mighty Benefactor's Name  Lift up your Voices all with one accord  For the Great Theme requires your noblest Flights  WILLIAM  the Great the Good the Just is gone  Yet never never shall He die entire  But his Immortal Memory shall last  As long as Gratitude remains in Men  As long as lovely Liberty remains  For  WILLIAM  was the Greatest Best of Kings  That e'er was sent from Heaven to rule the Earth  Or will be sent when Golden Times return  Who persecuted and opprest by Fate  Outpower'd outnumber'd by the common Foe  Deserted by some Friends betray'd by some  Ill seconded by more almost alone  Did by a Conduct Matchless and Divine  Deliver lost  Batavia Belgia  save  New imp'd the  Roman  Eagles soaring Wings  To take a stronger and a nobler Flight  Britannia  he restor'd  Hibernia  He reduc'd  He Superstition's bloody Progress stopt  And check'd the Rage of Arbitrary Sway  Religion reestablish'd Right maintain'd  Supported Freedom Property secur'd  And made Oppression tremble when he frown'd  Was born and liv'd for the World's Happiness  In ev'ry Part of his unequal'd Life  A Hero still confest to all the World  And died at last as greatly as he liv'd  Whose dying Arm for Liberty did more  Than if the noblest Conquest he had gain'd  And who to sum all Praises up in one  Maintains ev'n dead the Freedom of the World  Both by his Conduct which Confederate Powers  By Him combin'd in mutual League persue  And by the Wisdom of that Mighty Queen  Who now adds Lustre to th' Imperial Crown  Her Wisdom and her Virtues are the Gifts  Which He upon these Happy Realms bestow'd  Had it not been for his Heroick Toils  The Golden Scepter She so mildly sways  Had been in bloody Hands an Iron Rod  And can we owe this Happiness to Him  And yet refuse our Benefactor's Praise  Where is our Honour Where our Gratitude  And where our boasted Loyalty to Her  Can we be Foes to his Immortal Name  Who gave us Her who all his wondrous Steps  Persues and seconds all his vast Designs  And may she second all till she attains  The Happy Glorious End which He propos'd  FINIS
