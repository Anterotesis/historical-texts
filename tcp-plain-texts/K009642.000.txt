 THE BUSIE BODY A COMEDY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE By Her Majesty's Servants  Written by Mrs SUSANNA CENTLIVRE  The Second Edition  Quem tulit ad scenam ventoso Gloria curru  Exanimat lentus Spectator sedulus inflat  Sic Leve sic parvum est animum quod laudis avarum  Subruit aut resicit  Horat Epist Lib II Ep  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT at the  CrossKeys  between the TWO  TempleGates  in  Fleetstreet  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  JOHN  Lord  SOMMERS  LordPresident of Her MAJESTY's most Honourable PrivyCouncil  May it please your Lordship  AS it's an Establish'd Custom in these latter Ages for all Writers particularly the Poetical to shelter their Productions under the Protection of the most Distinguish'd whose Approbation produces a kind of Inspiration much superior to that which the  Heathenish  Poets pretended to derive from their Fictitious  Apollo  So it was my Ambition to Address one of my weak Performances to Your Lordship who by Universal Consent are justly allow'd to be the best Judge of all kinds of Writing  I was indeed at first deterr'd from my Design by a Thought that it might be accounted unpardonable Rudeness to obtrude a Trifle of this Nature to a Person whose sublime Wisdome moderates that Council which at this Critical Juncture overrules the Fate of all  Europe  But then I was encourag'd by Reflecting that  Lelius  and  Scipio  the two greatest Men in their  Time among the  Romans  both for Political and Military Virtues in the height of their important Affairs thought the Perusal and Improving of  Terence  's Comedies the noblest way of unbinding their Minds I own I were guilty of the highest Vanity should I presume to put my Composures in Parallel with those of that Celebrated  Dramatist  But then again I hope that Your Lordship's native Goodness and Generosity in Condescention to the Taste of the Best and Fairest part of the Town who have been pleas'd to be diverted by the following SCENES will excuse and overlook such Faults as your nicer Judgment might discern  And here my Lord the Occasion seems fair for me to engage in a Panegyrick upon those Natural and Acquired Abilities which so brightly Adorn your Person But I shall resist that Temptation being conscious of the Inequality of a Female Pen to so Masculine an Attempt and having no other Ambition than to Subscribe my self  My Lord  Your Lordship's Most Humble and Most Obedient Servant SUSANNA CENTLIVRE  PROLOGUE  By the Author of TUNBRIDGEWALKS  THO' modern Prophets were expos'd of late  The Author cou'd not Prophesy his Fate  If with such Scenes an Audience had been fir'd  The Poet must have really been Inspir'd  But these alas are Melancholy Days  For Modern Prophets and for Modern Plays  Yet since Prophetick Lyes please Fools o' Fashion  And Women are so fond of Agitation  To Men of Sense I'll Prophesy anew  And tell you wond'rous things that will prove true  Undaunted Colonels will to Camps repair  Assur'd there'll be no Skirmishes this Year  On our own Terms will flow the wish'dfor Peace  All Wars except 'twixt Man and Wife will cease  The Grand Monarch may wish his Son a Throne  But hardly will advance to lose his own  This Season most things bear a smiling Face  But Play'rs in Summer have a dismal Case  Since your Appearance only is our Act of Grace  Court Ladies will to Country Seats be gone  My Lord can't all the Year live Great in Town  Where wanting  Opera's Basset  and a  Play  They'll sigh and stitch a Gown to pass the time away  Gay CityWives at  Tunbridge  will appear  Whose Husbands long have labour'd for an Heir  Where many a Courtier may their Wants relieve  But by the Waters only they Conceive  The  Fleetstreet  SempstressToast of  Temple  Sparks  That runs Spruce Neckcloths for Attorney's Clerks  At  Cupid  's Gardens will her Hours regale  Sing fair  Dorinda  and drink Bottl'd Ale  At all Assemblies Rakes are up and down  And Gamesters where they think they are not known  Shou'd I denounce our Author's Fate to Day  To cry down Prophecies you'd damn the Play  Yet Whims like these have sometimes made you Laugh  'Tis Tattling all like  Isaac Bickerstaff  Since War and Places claim the Bards that write  Be kind and bear a Woman's Treat to Night  Let your Indulgence all her Fears allay  And none but WomanHaters damn this Play  EPILOGUE  IN me you see one  BusieBody  more  Tho' you may have enough of one before  With Epilogues the  BusieBody  's Way  We strive to help but sometimes mar a Play  At this mad Sessions half condemn'd e'er try'd  Some in three Days have been turn'd off and dy'd  In spight of Parties their Attempts are vain  For like false Prophets they ne'er rise again  Too late when cast your Favour one beseeches  And Epilogues prove ExecutionSpeeches  Yet sure I spy no  BusieBodies  here  And one may pass since they do ev'ry where  Sowr Criticks Time and Breath and Censures waste  And baulk your Pleasures to refine your Taste  One busie Don illtim'd high Tenets Preaches  Another yearly shows himself in Speeches  Some snivling Cits would have a Peace for spight  To starve those Warriors who so bravely fight  Still of a Foe upon his Knees afraid  Whose wellbang'd Troops want Money Heart and Bread  Old Beaux who none not ev'n themselves can please  Are busie still for nothingbut to teize  The Young so busie to engage a Heart  The Mischief done are busy most to part  Ungrateful Wretches who still cross one's Will  When they more kindly might be busie still  One to a Husband who ne'er dreamt of Horns  Shows how dear Spouse with Friend his Brows adorns  Th' Officious Telltale Fool he shou'd repent it  Parts three kind Souls that liv'd at Peace contented  Some with LawQuirks set  Houses  by the Ears  With Physick one what he would heal impairs  Like that dark mob'd up Fry that neighb'ring Curse  Who to remove Love's Pains bestow a worse  Since then this medling Tribe infest the Age  Bear one awhile expos'd upon the Stage  Let none but  BusieBodies  vent their Spight  And with good Humour Pleasure crown the Night  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Sir  George Airy  A Gentleman of Four Thousand a Year in Love with

George Airy  meeting  Charles  Cha  HA Sir  George Airy  A Birding thus early what forbidden Game rouz'd you so soon For no lawful Occasion cou'd invite a Person of your Figure abroad at such unfashionable Hours  Sir Geo  There are some Men  Charles  whom Fortune has left free from Inquietudes who are diligently studious to find out Ways and Means to make themselves uneasie  Cha  Is it possible that any thing in Nature can ruffle the Temper of a Man whom the four Seasons of the Year compliment with as many thousand Pounds nay and a Father at Rest with his Ancestors  Sir Geo  Why there 'tis now a Man that wants Money thinks none can be unhappy that has it but my Affairs are in such a whimsical Posture that it will require a Calculation of my Nativity to find if my Gold will relieve me or not  Cha  Ha ha ha never consult the Stars about that Gold has a Power beyond them Gold unlocks the Midnight Councils Gold outdoes the Wind becalms the Ship or fills her Sails Gold is omnipotent below it makes whole Armies fight or fly it buys even Souls and bribes the Wretches to  betray their Country Then what can thy Business be that Gold won't serve thee in  Sir Geo  Why I'm in Love  Cha  In LoveHa ha ha ha In Love Ha ha ha with what prithee a  Cherubin  Sir Geo  No with a Woman  Cha  A Woman Good Ha ha ha and Gold not help thee  Sir Geo  But suppose I'm in Love with two  Cha  Ay if thou'rt in Love with two hundred Gold will fetch 'em I warrant thee Boy But who are they who are they come  Sir Geo  One is a Lady whose Face I never saw but witty as an Angel the other beautiful as  Venus  Cha  And a Fool  Sir Geo  For ought I know for I never spoke to her but you can inform me I am charm'd by the Wit of One and dye for the Beauty of the Other  Cha  And pray which are you in Quest of now  Sir Geo  I prefer the Sensual Pleasure I'm for her I've seen who is thy Father's Ward  Miranda  Cha  Nay then I pity you for the Jew my Father will no more part with her and Pound than he wou'd with a Guinea to keep me from starving  Sir Geo  Now you see Gold can't do every thing  Charles  Cha  Yes for 'tis her Gold that bars my Father's Gate against you  Sir Geo  Why if he is this avaricious Wretch how cam'st thou by such a liberal Education  Cha  Not a Souse out of his Pocket I assure you I had an Uncle who defray'd that Charge but for some little Wildnesses of Youth tho' he made me his Heir left Dad my Guardian till I came to Years of Discretion which I presume the old Gentleman will never think I am and now he has got the Estate into his Clutches it does me no more good than if it lay in  Prester John  's Dominions  Sir Geo  What can'st thou find no Stratagem to redeem it  Cha  I have made many Essays to no purpose tho' Want the Mistress of Invention still tempts me on yet still the old Fox is too cunning for meI am upon my last Project which if it fails then for my last Refuge a Brown Musquet  Sir Geo  What is't can I assist thee  Cha  Not yet when you can I have Confidence enough in you to ask it  Sir Geo  I am always ready but what do's he intend to do with  Miranda  Is she to be sold in private or will he put her up by way of Auction at who bids most If so Egad I'm for him my Gold as you say shall be subservient to my Pleasure  Cha  To deal ingenuously with you Sir  George  I know very little of Her or Home for since my Uncle's Death and my Return from Travel I have never been well with my Father he thinks my Expences too great and I his Allowance too little he never sees me but he quarrels and to avoid that I shun his House as much as possible The Report is he intends to marry her himself  Sir Geo  Can she consent to it  Cha  Yes faith so they say but I tell you I am wholly ignorant of the matter  Miranda  and I are like two violent Members of a contrary Party I can scarce allow her Beauty tho' all the World do's nor she me Civility for that Contempt I fancy she plays the Motherinlaw already and sets the old Gentleman on to do mischief  Sir Geo  Then I've your free Consent to get her  Cha  Ay and my helpinghand if occasion be  Sir Geo  Pugh yonder's a Fool coming this way let's avoid him  Cha  What  Marplot  no no he's my Instrument there's a thousand Conveniencies in him he'll lend me his Money when he has any run of my Errands and be proud on't in short he'll Pimp for me Lye for me Drink for me do any thing but fight for me and that I trust to my own Arm for  Sir Geo  Nay then he's to be endur'd I never knew his Qualifications before  Enter  Marplot  with a Patch cross his Face  Marpl  Dear  Charles  your'sHa Sir  George Airy  the Man in the World I have an Ambition to be known to  aside  Give me thy Hand dear Boy  Cha  A good Assurance But hark ye how came your Beautiful Countenance clouded in the wrong place  Marpl  I must confess 'tis a little  Malapropos  but no matter for that a Word with you  Charles  Prithee introduce me to Sir  George  he is a Man of Wit and I'd give ten Guineas to  Cha  When you have 'em you mean  Marpl  Ay when I have 'em pugh pox you cut the Thread of my DiscourseI wou'd give ten Guineas I say to be rank'd in his Acquaintance Well 'tis a vast Addition to a Man's Fortune according to the Rout of the World to be seen in the Company of Leading Men for then we are all thought to be Politicians or Whigs or Jacks or HighFlyers or LowFlyers or Levellersand so forth for you must know we all herd in Parties now  Cha  Then a Fool for Diversion is out of Fashion I find  Marpl  Yes without it be a mimicking Fool and they are Darlings every where but prithee introduce me  Cha  Well on Condition you'll give us a true Account how you came by that Mourning Nose I will  Marpl  I'll do it  Cha  Sir  George  here's a Gentleman has a passionate Desire to kiss your Hand  Sir Geo  Oh I honour Men of the Sword and I presume this Gentleman is lately come from  Spain  or  Portugal  by his Scars  Marpl  No really Sir  George  mine sprung from civil Fury happening last Night into the GroomPortersI had a strong Inclination to go ten Guineas with a sort of a sort of akind of a Milk Sop as I thought A Pox of the Dice he flung out and my Pockets being empty as  Charles  knows they sometimes are he prov'd a surly  NorthBritain  and broke my Face for my Deficiency  Sir Geo  Ha ha and did not you draw  Marpl  Draw Sir why I did but lay my Hand upon my Sword to make a swift Retreat and he roar'd out Now the Deel a Ma sol Sir gin ye touch yer Steel Ise whip mine through yer Wem  Sir Geo  Ha ha ha  Cha  Ha ha ha ha safe was the Word so you walk'd off I suppose  Marpl  Yes for I avoid fighting purely to be serviceable to my Friends you know  Sir Geo  Your Friends are much oblig'd to you Sir I hope you'll rank me in that Number  Marpl  Sir  George  a Bow from the side Box or to be seen in your Chariot binds me ever yours  Sir Geo  Trifles you may command 'em when you please  Cha  Provided he may command you  Marpl  Me why I live for no other purposeSir  George  I have the Honour to be caress'd by most of the reigning Toasts of the Town I'll tell 'em you are the finest Gentleman  Sir Geo  No no prithee let me alone to tell the Ladiesmy Partscan you convey a Letter upon Occasion or deliver a Message with an Air of Business Ha  Marpl  With the Assurance of a Page and the Gravity of a Statesman  Sir Geo  You know  Miranda  Marpl  What my Sister  Ward  Why her Guardian is mine we are Fellow Sufferers Ah he is a covetous cheating sanctify'd Curmudgeon that Sir  Francis Gripe  is a damn'd old  Cha  I suppose Friend you forget that he is my Father  Marpl  I ask your Pardon  Charles  but it is for your sake I hate him Well I say the World is mistaken in him his Out side Piety makes him every Man's Executor and his Inside Cunning makes him every Heir's Jaylor Egad  Charles  I'm half persuaded that thou'rt some  Ward  too and never of  his getting For thou art as honest a Debauchee as ever Cuckolded Man of Quality  Sir Geo  A pleasant Fellow  Cha  The Dog is Diverting sometimes or there wou'd be no enduring his Impertinence He is pressing to be employ'd and willing to execute but some ill Fate generally attends all he undertakes and he oftner spoils an Intreague than helps it  Marpl  If I miscarry 'tis none of my Fault I follow my Instructions  Cha  Yes witness the Merchant's Wife  Marpl  Pish Pox that was an Accident  Sir Geo  What was it prithee  Cha  Why you must know I had lent a certain Merchant my hunting Horses and was to have met his Wife in his Absence Sending him alone with my Groom to make the Complement and to deliver a Letter to the Lady at the same time what does he do but gives the Husband the Letter and offers her the Horses  Marpl  I remember you was even with me for you deny'd the Letter to be yours and swore I had a design upon her which my Bones paid for  Cha  Come Sir  George  let's walk round if you are not ingag'd for I have sent my Man upon a little earnest Business and I have order'd him to bring me the Answer into the Park  Marpl  Business and I not know it Egad I'll watch him  Sir Geo  I must beg your Pardon  Charles  I am to meet your Father  Cha  My Father  Sir Geo  Aye and about the oddest Bargain perhaps you ever heard of but I'll not impart till I know the Success  Marpl  What can his Business be with Sir  Francis  Now would I give all the World to know it why the Devil should not one know every Man's Concern  Aside  Cha  Prosperity to't whate'er it be I have private Affairs too over a Bottle we'll compare Notes  Marpl  Charles  knows I love a Glass as well as any Man I'll make one shall it be to Night Ad I long to know their Secrets  Aside  Enter  Whisper  Whis  Sir Sir Mrs  Patch  says  Isabinda  's Spanish Father has quite spoil'd the Plot and she can't meet you in the Park but he infallibly will go out this Afternoon she says but I must step again to know the Hour  Marpl  What did  Whisper  say now I shall go stark mad if I'm not let into this Secret  Aside  Cha  Curst Misfortune come along with me my Heart feels Pleasure at her Name Sir  George  yours we'll meet at the old Place the usual Hour  Sir Geo  Agreed I think I see Sir  Francis  yonder  Exit  Cha  Marplot  you must excuse I am engag'd  Exit  Marpl  Engag'd Egad I'll engage my Life I'll know what your Engagement is  Exit  Miran  Coming out of a Chair  Let the Chair wait My Servant that dog'd Sir  George  said he was in the Park  Enter  Patch  Ha Mis  Patch  alone did not you tell me you had contriv'd a way to bring  Isabinda  to the Park  Patch  Oh Madam your Ladiship can't imagine what a wretched Disappointment we have met with Just as I had fetch'd a Suit of my Cloaths for a Disguise comes my old Master into his Closet which is right against her ChamberDoor this struck us into a terrible FrightAt length I put on a grave Face and ask'd him if he was at leisure for his Chocolate in hopes to draw him out of his Hole but he snap'd my Nose off No I shall be busie here this two Hours at which my poor Mistress seeing no way of Escape order'd me to wait on your Ladiship with the sad Relation  Miran  Unhappy  Isabinda  Was ever any thing so unaccountable as the Humour of Sir  Jealousie Traffick  Patch  Oh Madam it's his living so long in  Spain  he vows he'll spend half his Estate but he'll be a ParliamentMan on purpose to bring in a Bill for Women to wear Veils and the other odious  Spanish  CustomsHe swears it is the height of Impudence to have a Woman seen barefac'd even at Church and scarce believes there's a true begotten Child in the City  Miran  Ha ha ha how the old Fool torments himself Suppose he could introduce his rigid Rulesdoes he think we could not match them in Contrivance No no Let the Tyrant Man make what Laws he will if there's a Woman under the Government I warrant she finds a way to break 'em Is his Mind set upon the  Spaniard  for his Soninlaw still  Patch  Ay and he expects him by the next Fleet which drives his Daughter to Melancholy and Despair But Madam I find you retain the same gay cheerful Spirit you had when I waited on your LadishipMy Lady is mighty good humour'd too and I have found a way to make Sir  Jealousie  believe I am wholly in his Interest when my real Design is to serve her he makes me her Jaylor and I set her at Liberty  Miran  I knew thy Prolifick Brain wou'd be of singular Service to her or I had not parted with thee to her Father  Patch  But Madam the Report is that you are going to marry your Guardian  Miran  It is necessary such a Report shou'd be  Patch  Patch  But is it true Madam  Miran  That's not absolutely necessary  Patch  I thought it was only the old strain coaxing him still for your own and railing at all the young Fellows about Town In my Mind now you are as ill plagu'd with your Guardian Madam as my Lady is with her Father  Miran  No I have Liberty Wench that she wants what would she give now to be in this  dissabilee  in theopen Air nay more in pursuit of the young Fellow she likes for that's my Case I assure thee  Patch  As for that Madam she's even with you for tho'  she can't come abroad we have a way to bring him home in spight of old  Argus  Miran  Now  Patch  your Opinion of my Choice for here he comesHa my Guardian with him what can be the meaning of this I'm sure Sir  Francis  can't know me in this DressLet's observe 'em  They withdraw  Enter Sir  Francis Gripe  and Sir  George Airy  Sir Fran  Verily Sir  George  thou wilt repent throwing away thy Money so for I tell thee sincerely  Miranda  my Charge do's not love a young Fellow they are all vicious and seldom make good Husbands in sober Sadness she cannot abide 'em  Miran  Peeping  In sober Sadness you are mistakenwhat can this mean  Sir Geo  Look ye Sir  Francis  whether she can or cannot abide young Fellows is not the Business will you take the fifty Guineas  Sir Fran  In good truthI will not for I knew thy Father he was a hearty wary Man and I cannot consent that his Son should squander away what he sav'd to no purpose  Mirand  Peeping  Now in the Name of Wonder what Bargain can he be driving about me for fifty Guineas  Patch  I wish it ben't for the first Nights Lodging Madam  Sir Geo  Well Sir  Francis  since you are so conscientious for my Father's sake then permit me the Favour  Gratis  Miran  Peeping  The Favour O' my Life I believe 'tis as you said  Patch  Sir Fran  No verily if thou dost not buy thy Experience thou wilt never be wise therefore give me a Hundred and try Fortune  Sir Geo  The Scruples arose I find from the scanty SumLet me seea Hundred Guineas  Takes 'em out of a Purse and chinks 'em  Ha they have a very pretty Sound and a very pleasing LookBut then  Miranda  But if she should be cruel  Miran  Peeping  As Ten to One I shall  Sir Fran  Ay do consider on't He he he he  Sir Geo  No I'll do't  Patch  Do't what whether you will or no Madam  Sir Geo  Come to the Point here's the Gold sum up the Condition  Sir Fran  Pulling out a Paper  Miran  Peeping  Ay for Heaven's sake do for my Expectation is on the Rack  Sir Fran  Well at your own Peril be it  Sir Geo  Aye aye go on  Sir Fran  Imprimis  you are to be admitted into my House in order to move your Suit to  Miranda  for the space of Ten Minutes without Lett or Molestation provided I remain in the same Room  Sir Geo  But out of Ear shot  Sir Fran  Well well I don't desire to hear what yousay Ha ha ha in consideration I am to have that Purse and a hundred Guineas  Sir Geo  Take it  Gives him the Purse  Miran  Peeping  So 'tis well it's

Love with this old Cuff nowPsha that's morally impossiblebut then what hopes have I to succeed I never spoke to her  Miran  Peeping  Say you so Then I am safe  Sir Geo  What tho' my Tongue never spoke my Eyes said a thousand Things and my Hopes flatter'd me hers answer'd 'em If I'm luckyif not 'tis but a hundred Guineas thrown away    Miranda  and  Patch  come forwards  Miran  Upon what Sir  George  Sir Geo  Ha my  Incognito  upon a Woman Madam  Miran  They are the worst things you can deal in and damage the soonest your very Breath destroys 'em and I fear you'll never see your Return Sir  George  Ha ha  Sir Geo  Were they more brittle than  China  and drop'd to pieces with a Touch every Atom of her I have ventur'd at if she is but Mistress of thy Wit balances Ten times the SumPrithee let me see thy Face  Miran  By no means that may spoil your Opinion of my Sense  Sir Geo  Rather confirm it Madam  Patch  So rob the Lady of your Gallantry Sir  Sir Geo  No Child a Dish of Chocolate in the Morning never spoils my Dinner the other Lady I design a set Meal so there's no danger  Miran  Matrimony Ha ha ha what Crimes have you committed against the God of Love that he should revenge 'em so severely to stamp Husband upon your Forehead  Sir Geo  For my Folly in having so often met you here without pursuing the Laws of Nature and exercising her commandBut I resolve e'er we part now to know who you are where you live and what kind of Flesh and Blood your Face is therefore unmask and don't put me to the trouble of doing it for you  Miran  My Face is the same Flesh and Blood with my Hand Sir  George  which if you'll be so rude to provoke  Sir Geo  You'll apply it to my CheekThe Ladies Favours are always Welcome but I must have that Cloud withdrawn  Taking hold of her  Remember you are in the  Park  Child and what a terrible thing would it be to lose this pretty white Hand  Miran  And how will it sound in a  ChocolateHouse  that Sir  George Airy  rudely pull'd off a Ladies Mask when he had given her his Honour that he never would directly or indirectly endeavour to know her till she gave him Leave  Patch  I wish we were safe out  Sir Geo  But if that Lady thinks fit to pursue and meet me at every turn like some troubled Spirit shall I be blam'd  if I inquire into the Reality I would have nothing dissatisfy'd in a Female Shape  Miran  What shall I do  Pause  Sir Geo  Ay prithee consider for thou shalt find me very much at thy Service  Batch  Suppose Sir the Lady should be in Love with you  Sir Geo  Oh I'll return the Obligation in a Moment  Patch  And marry her

Geo  Well to shew you I'm a Man of Honour I accept the Conditions Let me but once know those and the Face won't be long a Secret to me  Patch  What mean you Madam  Miran  To get off  Sir Geo  'Tis
