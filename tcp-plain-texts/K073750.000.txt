 THE HAPPY PRESCRIPTION OR THE LADY RELIEVED FROM HER LOVERS A COMEDY IN RHYME WRITTEN FOR A PRIVATE THEATRE BY WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  CALCUTTA PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXXV  TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE  Non perch' io creda bisognar mici carmi  A chi se ne fa copia da se stessa  Ma sol per sati  fare a questo mio  Che h  d' onorarla e di lodar disio  ARIO  TO Canto xxxvii  THE Great and Fair in ev'ry age and clime  Receive free homage from the Sons of Rhyme  Bend ye ambitious Bards at Grandeur's shrine  Be Power your patron Wit and Beauty mine  To thee whom elegance has taught to please  By serious dignity or sportive case  Whom Virtue hails at Pleasure's festive rites  Chaste Arbiter of Art's refin'd delights  To thee fair DEVON I breathe this votive strain  Nor dread th' averted ear of proud Disdain  For O if music has not blest my lyre  A lovelier spirit of th' aetherial choir  Joybreathing Gratitude that hallow'd guest  Who fires with heavenly zeal the human breast  Bids my weak voice her swelling note prolong  And consecrate to thee her tributary song  When first my anxious Muse's fav'rite child  Her young SERENA artless simple wild  Pr  'd from privacy's safe scenes to fly  And met in giddy haste the public eye  T  y  praise her trembling youth sustain'd  The  s  dar'd not ask from thee she gain'd  And found a guardian in the gracious DEVON  Kind as the regent of her fancied heaven  The flatter'd Muse whose offspring thou hast blest  In the fond pride that rules a parent's breast  Presents thus boldly to thy kind embrace  This little group of her succeeding race  Blest if by pathos true to Nature's law  From thy soft bosom they may haply draw  Those tender sighs that eloquently shew  The virtues of the heart from whence they flow  Blest if by foibles humorously hit  In the light scenes that aim at comic wit  They turn thy pensive charms to mirthful grace  And wake the sprightly sweetness of thy face  While thus the proud Enthusiast would aspire  To change thy beauties with her changing lyre  Much as she wants the talent and the right  To shew thy various charms in varied light  O might the Muse intruding on thy bower  From her fair Patron catch the magic power  Frequent to meet the public eye and still  That fickle eye with fond amazement fill  Let her if this vain wish is lost in air  Breathe from her grateful heart a happier prayer  Howe'er her different sables may give birth  To fancied woe and visionary mirth  May all thy griefs belong to Fiction's reign  And wound thee only with a pleasing pain  May thy light spirit on the sea of life  Elude the rocks of care the gusts of strife  And safely as the neversinking buoy  Float on th' unebbing flood of real joy  EARTHAM  January  W HAYLEY  PERSONS OF THE DRAMA  SIR NICHOLAS ODDFISH  SAPPHIC  DECISIVE  MORLEY  COLONEL FELIX  JONATHAN Servant to MORLEY  SELINA Niece to Sir NICHOLAS  MRS FELIX her Cousin and Wife to the COLONEL  JENNY Servant to SELINA  Servants of Sir NICHOLAS c  SCENE  the Country Mansion of the  ODDFISH  Family  THE HAPPY PRESCRIPTION  ACT THE FIRST SCENE I  Enter  Sir Nicholas  in debate with  Mrs Felix  and  Selina  Mrs FELIX  WHAT a strange declarationit gives me the spleen  But 'tis what good Sir Nicholas never can mean  Sir NICHOLAS  Not mean it fair ladyBy Jupiter yes  And my project you'll see will be crown'd with success  I am joyous myself and 'tis ever my plan  To give those I love all the joy that I can  Mrs FELIX  We own itbut joy is like diet dear cousin  One palate mayn't relish what pleases a dozen  Nor will I allow that my appetite's vicious  If perchance I don't like what you think most delicious  Sir NICHOLAS  Rare dainty distinctionsBut can I believe  That a woman e'er liv'd since the wedding of Eve  Whose heart tho' most coyly her head might be carried  Did not fervently wish to be speedily married  Not to wound your nice ears with the name of desires  Which youth renders lovely and nature inspires  Your sex from its weakness demands a defender  Whom pride and affection make watchful and tender  And if my fair Coz is no hypocrite grown  The truth of my maxims you'll honestly own  While the wars from your arms the brave Colonel detain  Is the want of a husband the source of no pain  Mrs FELIX  There indeed you have touch'd me a little too near  My Soldier you know to my soul is most dear  I ownand my frankness you never will blame  I'd purchase his presence with ought but his fame  Sir NICHOLAS  Well said thou dear honest and warmhearted wife  For thy truth may good angels still watch o'er his life  And while others the rough field of slaughter are treading  Send him home full of glory to dance at our wedding  For a wedding we'll have to enliven us all  And Hymen's bright altar shall warm the old hall  For my Niece ere I die 'tis my wish to provide  And ere two months are past I  will  see her a bride  I'm resolv'dand you know that my neighbours all say  Sir Nicholas Oddfish will have his own way  Mrs FELIX  Selina dear Sir wants no other protection  While her life glides in peace by your gentle direction  She thinks and I own I approve her remark  In conjugal cares 'tis too soon to embark  Her bosom untouch'd by Love's dangerous dart  Fate has not yet shewn her the man of her heart  Sir NICHOLAS  The man of her heartthese nonsensical fancies  You lightheaded females pick out of romances  That I am no tyrant you know very well  So Cousin don't teach my good Niece to rebel  I am no greedy guardian who thinks it his duty  On the altar of Plutus to sacrifice beauty  Whose venal barbarity justly abhorr'd  Ties a lovely young girl to an old crippled lord  And basely to gain either rank or estate  Makes her swear she will love what she cannot but hate  From such a protector Heaven guard my dear Niece  I wish her to wed that her joys may increase  And the deuce must be in the strange girl who discovers  No man to her mind in such plenty of lovers  To no very great length will my cruelty run  If from twenty admirers I bid her chuse one  Mrs FELIX  But why dear Sir Nicholas why in such haste  Sir NICHOLAS  'Tis thus that my projects are ever disgrac'd  With the false names of hurry and precipitation  Because I abhor silly procrastination  That thief of delight who deludes all our senses  Who cheats us for ever with idle pretences  By whom like the dog in the fable betray'd  We let go the substance to snap at the shade  To seize present Time is the true Art of Life  'Tis Time who now cries make Selina a Wife  The season is come I've so long wish'd to see  From the moment I dandled her first on my knee  She you know to my care was bequeath'd by my Brother  And having this Child I ne'er wish'd for another  Thro' life I have kept myself single for her  Her interest her joy to my own I prefer  SELINA  Your kindness dear Sir I can never repay  Sir NICHOLAS  In truth my dear damsel you easily may  I demand no return so enormously great  I ask but a Boy to possess my estate  SELINA  Lord Uncle how come such odd thoughts in your head  Mrs FELIX  From his heart I assure you'tis pleasantly said  A fair stipulationboth parties agreed  The compact I trust in due time will succeed  But patience dear Knight you will have your desire  Nor wait very long for a young little 'Squire  Sir NICHOLAS  The cold stream of Patience ne'er creeps in my veins  But the wish my heart forms my quick spirit attains  I'm none of your chill atmospherical wretches  Whose affections are subject to starts and to catches  Whose wish like a weathercock veering about  Now turns towards hope and now changes to doubt  No mine like the needle without variation  Only looks to one point and that point's Consummation  I want to behold this young Urchin arise  Before I have lost or my legs or my eyes  That I may enjoy all his little vagaries  As the changeable season of infancy varies  I long to be moulding his heart and his spirit  To shew him the fields he is born to inherit  Lead him round our rich woods while my limbs are yet limber  And tell the young rogue how I've nurs'd up his timber  That when the worn thread of my life is untwisted  He long may remember that I have existed  And when my old frame in our monument rests  As he walks by my grave with a few worthy guests  He thus to some warmhearted friend may address him  Here lies my odd honest old UncleGod bless him  Mrs FELIX  Thank Heaven dear Cousin your hale constitution  Shews not the least sign of a near dissolution  SELINA  To make your life happy whate'er the condition  Has been my dear Uncle my highest ambition  To fulfil every wish that your fancy can frame  Still is as it ought to be ever my aim  But if by your voice I am doom'd to the altar  With terror and pain my weak accents must falter  Unless my kind stars a new lover should send me  Unlike all the swains who now deign to attend me  Sir NICHOLAS  Nice wench do you want the whole world to adore you  Would you have all the men of the earth rang'd before you  For thanks to your charms and to fortune's kind bounty  You may rank in your train all the youth of our county  And chuse whom you will if the man has but worth  And is nearly your equal in wealth and in birth  I give my consentyou are free from restriction  But I will not be plagu'd with perverse contradiction  I will see you wed without any delay  Your two fittest lovers are coming today  Young Sapphic whose verses delight all the fair  And Dicky Decisive Sir Jacob's next heir  Both young and both wealthy both comely and clever  To gain you no doubt each will warmly endeavour  For they come for a month by my own invitation  On purpose to found my dear girl's inclination  I have said to them both and no man can speak fairer  Let him who can please her most win her and wear her  SELINA  aside to  Mrs Felix  Good angels defend me  Mrs FELIX  I see nothing frightful  Our month with such guests must be very delightful  When Sapphic's soft verses incline us to dose  Dick will keep us awake with satirical prose  Sir NICHOLAS  Don't cross me I say nor mislead my good Niece  By Jove if she thwarts me with any caprice  Like a certain old justice I'll ring up my maids  And marry the first of the frankhearted jades  For perverse contradiction I never will bear  But provide for myself a more dutiful heir  Mrs FELIX  Dear Cousin in spite of his worship's decision  You cannot be certain of such a provision  Attempts of that nature are subject to fail  Sir NICHOLAS  My designs you shall see Madam always prevail  For if this nice Gipsy by your machination  Declines every offer to give me vexation  Like my late jolly neighbour Sir Timothy Trickum  Who vindictively married the frail Molly Quickum  I'll make sure of the matter and chuse me a wife  With an heir ready plac'd on the threshold of life  For as I have said tho' a foe to restriction  I never will suffer perverse contradiction  You now know my mind which no mask ever covers  So farewell and prepare to receive your two lovers  Exit  Mrs FELIX  Go thy way thou strange mixture of sense and of blindness  A model at once of oppression and kindness  Thy will thou odd compound of goodness and whim  Is a stream against which it is treason to swim  Yet we must cross the current  SELINA  Dear Cousin say how  Direct opposition he will not allow  What can you devise as a plan of prevention  How divert his keen spirit from this new intention  I had much rather die than be ever united  To one of the lovers that he has invited  My heart has a thorough aversion to both  Yet to make him unhappy I'm equally loth  When I think what I owe to his tender protection  The worst of all ills is to lose his affection  Mrs FELIX  Dear Girl your warm gratitude gives you new charms  'Tis an amiable fear which your bosom alarms  And I from your Uncle's quick humour would screen you  Nor loosen the bands of affection between you  He merits your love and you know he has mine  Yet we somehow must baffle his hasty design  Nor suffer his whim thus to make you a Wife  To repent the rash business the rest of his life  Take courage kind Chance may assist us  SELINA  I doubt it  Yet Heaven knows how we shall manage without it  For when his heart's set on a favorite scheme  His ardor and haste as you know are extreme  Like a med'cine illtim'd opposition is vain  And inflames the disorder 'twas meant to restrain  Mrs FELIX  In his fevers indeed there is no intermission  And thanks gentle Coz to your soft disposition  So sweet and compliant your temper has been  You have taught him to think contradiction a sin  And here all around him confirm that belief  His vassals all bow to the nod of their chief  Here shut from the world in this rural dominion  No mortal opposes his will or opinion  And thus he is spoil'dPoliticians all say  Human nature's not fashion'd for absolute sway  SELINA  'Tis true tho' the world as you say think him odd  In this sphere he is held a diminutive god  And when I behold how his fortune is spent  In suppressing vexation and spreading content  When I hear all the poor his kind bounty expressing  And thoroughly know how he merits their blessing  My feelings with theirs in his eulogy join  And confess that his nature is truly divine  Mrs FELIX  Thou excellent Girl if such fondness and zeal  For a warmhearted whimsical Uncle you feel  With what fine sensations your bosom will glow  What tender attachment your temper will shew  When your fortunate lord Love and Hymen invest  With higher dominion o'er that gentle breast  But tell me dear Cousinbe honestdeclare  Has no young secret swain form'd an interest there  I suspectbut don't let my suspicion affright you  Tho' the good Knight's rare virtues amuse and delight you  From this gloomy old hall you would wish to get free  Had not Cupid preserv'd you from feeling  ennui    Come tell me the name of the favorite youth  I am sure I guess right  SELINA  No in sad sober truth  I never have seen in the course of my life  A mortal to whom I should chuse to be wise  Mrs FELIX  Ye stars what a pityI wish I could learn  That my Colonel from India would shortly return  Both for your sake and mine for our present distress  He would speedily turn into joyous success  As his regiment must some young hero afford  Who might throw at your feet both himself and his sword  What say you my dear to a soldier  Enter  Jenny  JENNY  Oh Madam  Here's young Mr SapphicI vow if I had them  I'd give fifty pounds had you seen how politely  He beg'd me to tie a sweet nosegay up tightly  Which is jolted to pieceswell he's a sweet beau  And now with his pencil he's writing below  I believe 'tis a posy he writes it so neatly  And I'm sure 'tis fine verse Ma'am it sounded so sweetly  Mrs FELIX  Oh charming his vows will be very sublime  And I trust we shall hear his proposals in rhyme  SELINA  How can you dear Cousin so cruelly jest in  A business you know I am really distrest in  I shall certainly forfeit my Uncle's protection  For I never can wed where I feel no affection  Do help me  Mrs FELIX  Good Girl this perplexity smother  And think your two lovers will banish each other  There's much to be hop'd from our present affairs  JENNY  O Ma'am Mr Sapphic is coming up stairs  Aside as she goes out  I am mightily pleas'd with this marrying plan  And I hope in my spirit that he'll be the man  Exit  Enter  Sapphic  SAPPHIC  Fair Ladies the moments have seem'd to be hours  While I stopt in your hall to adjust a few flowers  For the season I'm told they're uncommonly fine  But I still wish the tribute more worthy the shrine  Bowing and presenting them to  Selina  SELINA  Mr Sapphic is always extremely polite  These roses indeed are a wonderful sight  You are far better florists than we are  Mrs FELIX  My dear  Mr Sapphic has magic to make them appear  And Flora is brib'd by the songs he composes  To produce for her poet extempore roses  Into this early bloom all her plants are bewitch'd  But you do not observe how the gift is inrich'd  Here's a border of verse if my eyes don't deceive me  SELINA  aside to  Mrs Felix  Dear Cousin you'll read itI pray you relieve me  I shall blush like a fool at each civil expression  Mrs Felix  aside to  Selina  taking the paper  Now with emphasis just and with proper discretion  Mrs Felix  reads    "Ye happy flowers give and receive perfume  "As on Selina's fragrant breast ye bloom  "From earth tho' not arrang'd in order nice  "Ye are transplanted into Paradise  "If on that spot ye languish into death  "'Twill be from envy of her sweeter breath"  'Tis a delicate compliment tender and pretty  What original spirit how graceful and witty  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am you're too good to find any thing in it  'Tis a mere hasty triflethe work of a minute  On the anvil had not a moment to hammer  And I fear in my haste I have sinn'd against grammar  Mrs FELIX  All slight imperfections I never regard  When I meet with such vigor of thought in a bard  With a fancy so brilliant  SAPPHIC  O Ma'am you're too kind  But candor's the test of an amiable mind  I wish that your taste all our Critics might guide  To soften that rigor with which they decide  Mrs FELIX  From Critics dear Sir you have litttle to fear  If Mr Decisive himself had been here  He must have been charm'd with this sweet  jeu d'esprit  Which as he is coming today he shall see  I am eager to hear how his wit will applaud it  To conceal it would be of due praise to defraud it  SAPPHIC  In Mercy's name Ladies I beg your protection  Preserve my poor rhymes from Decisive's inspection  Consider how hasty  Mrs FELIX  Say rather how sprightly  SAPPHIC  Compos'd in a moment  Mrs FELIX  Produc'd so politely  SAPPHIC  He'll cut them to atoms  Mrs FELIX  Dear Sir he's your friend  And I thought he had seen all the poems you pen'd  I was told that to him your long works you rehearse  Does Mr Decisive himself write in verse  SAPPHIC  I wish from my soul that he did now and then  But he uses the penknife much more than the pen  And too freely has slash'd all who write in the nation  To give them an opening for retaliation  My old friend Decisive has honour and wit  To the latter indeed he makes most things submit  And thinks it fair sport as a friend or a foe  To knock down a Bard by a flaming  bon mot  To your sex indeed his chief failings I trace  For the fairones so flatter'd his figure and face  That too early he ceas'd the chaste Muses to follow  And being Adonis would not be Apollo  Mrs FELIX  Yet he has much fancy  SAPPHIC  O Madam no doubt  And genius that study would soon have brought out  Had his thoughts been less turn'd to his legs and his looks  Ere this he'd have written some excellent books  'Tis pity such parts should thro' indolence fall  But he never composes and reads not at all  SELINA  Not read Mr Sapphic you surely mistake  Your friend cannot be an illiterate rake  Our neighbours who lately from London came down  Declare that his word forms the taste of the town  SAPPHIC  Dear Madam the business is easily done  He judges all authors but never reads one  Mrs FELIX  I'm sure he must own this  impromptu  is sweet  And I vow he shall read it  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am I intreat  I conjure you to spare me this earnest petition  I know you will grant me  Mrs FELIX  On this one condition  That for six lines suppress'd you indulge me with twenty  Come shew us your pocketbookthere you have plenty  Of tender poetical squibs for the Fair  SAPPHIC  taking out his pocketbook  Dear Ma'am here is nothing  Mrs FELIX  A volume I swear  O charming well now you're an excellent man  'Tis stuff'd like a pincushion  SAPPHIC  Yes Ma'amwith bran  Mrs FELIX  Fie fie you're too modest and murder my meaning  What a harvest is here yet I ask but a gleaning  It would not be fair to seize all the collection  Tho' all is most certainly worthy inspection  Indulge us dear Sir come I'll take no refusal  SAPPHIC  Indeed Ma'am here's nothing that's fit for perusal  Mrs FELIX  There are fifty fine things and one can't chuse amiss  SAPPHIC  taking out a paper▪  Here's one new little song  Mrs FELIX  Well then let me have this  SAPPHIC  after giving a paper  They all are so jumbled I fear I am wrong  I meant to have shewn you a new little song  Which was written last week on the ball at our races  Where I heard the Miss Trotters compar'd to the Graces  I could not help saying t'was very profane  It was taking the name of the Graces in vain  Mrs FELIX  reads  "  On seeing Selina and Jenny near each other in  "  the garden  "  O mercy dear Madam you must not read those  A stanza unfinish'd  Mrs FELIX  How sweetly it flows  Selina pray hear it  SELINA  aside to  Mrs FELIX  Dear Cousin enough  How can you delight in his horrible stuff  Mrs FELIX  reads  "Tho' each in the same garden blows  "The poet must be crazy  "Who when invited by the rose  "Can stoop to pick the daisy"  SELINA  aside to  Mrs FELIX  If you love me dear Cousin assist me I pray  To end all this nonsense and get him away  Pray Sir when you came was my Uncle below  SAPPHIC  He's abroad Ma'am your servant inform'd me  SELINA  O No  You have heard he is building a temple to Pan  And we hope that your taste may embellish the plan  At the end of the walk in his favourite grove  Where there formerly stood an old ruin'd alcove  You'll find him and as 'tis an art you are skill'd in  Twill please him to know what you think of the building  Mrs FELIX  Aye do Mr Sapphic inspect what is done  For the workmen all blunder'd when first they begun  Your opinion I'm sure will oblige the good Knight  SELINA  An inscription he once said he wish'd you to write  SAPPHIC  Dear Madamthe hint is delightful I vow  To the God of Arcadia I hasten to bow  I shall find the good Knight in the midst of the dome  I am heartily glad that he is not from home  We shall surely contrive something clever between us  And the Muse will compose by the order of Venus  Bows tenderly to  Selina  and exit  SELINA  How could you so praise that impertinent creature  And praise him without discomposing a feature  I could not have thought before this conversation  That your frankness could turn into such adulation  Mrs FELIX  The World my dear Child is to you quite unknown  When you see it you'll find such discourse is the  ton    Fine folks in high life learn to praise with great glee  Such persons and things as they sicken to see  To me your best thanks for my speeches are due  By thus flattering the Poet I surely serve you  He will now play the Skylark instead of the Dove  And stun me with songs while you're sav'd from his love  Enter  Jenny  JENNY  Dear Ma'am now I hope Mr Sapphic's quite blest  For he flies thro' the walks like a bird to his nest  He's a sweet pretty gentleman  Mrs FELIX  aside to  Selina  This if I shew it  Will soon banish Jenny's regard for the poet  Jenny see what your friend Mr Sapphic has written  JENNY  Dear Ma'am with his verses I always am smitten  Having read the stanza  A Daisy indeed to be sure I am neat  But tho' I'm a servant I hope I am sweet  When he makes my young Mistress a Rose or a Lilly  He might turn me at least to a Daffydowndilly  But a Daisy forsooth with no fragrance at all  I'll cross him for this  SELINA  What's that noise in the hall  JENNY  As sure as I live 'tis your other gay Spark  For I saw a new chaise driving into the park  I'll see Ma'am    Aside going out    I'll shew this fine Poet a trick  A Daisy that no one but children will pick  Exit  Mrs FELIX  This simile Jenny I see cannot swallow  And her anger may ruin this son of Apollo  For in courtship this maxim is often display'd  He has half lost the Mistress who loses the Maid  Enter  Decisive  DECISIVE  Alone my dear Ladiesthey told me below  Our friend Sapphic was here your poetical Beau  I was almost afraid that my sudden intrusion  Might check the rich stream of some lyric effusion    To  Selina  I'm happy to see you so lovely today  But I hope I've not frighted your Poet away  SELINA  O noMr Sapphic had bid us adieu  Mrs FELIX  And not without saying some fine things of you  He declares that with those brilliant parts you possess  'Tis a sin you ne'er send any work to the press  DECISIVE  Good Sapphic In truth 'tis his comfort to think  The whole duty of man lies in spilling of ink  And at Paradise gate his large volumes of metre  Will I hope be allow'd a fair pass by Saint Peter  Mrs FELIX  Then the Saint must be free from your critical spirit  For I know you have little esteem for their merit  You're a rigorous judge and to poets terrific  DECISIVE  I wish my friend's muse was not quite so prolific  But in rhymes when a child I have heard he would squeak  And so proved a poet before he could speak  On his deathbed I doubt not he'll still think of verse  And groan out a rhyme to his doctor or nurse  Mrs FELIX  I fancy your favourite reading is prose  Here's a new set of travels pray have you read those  DECISIVE  taking the book  This author is lucky to meet with a buyer  A traveller's but a soft word for a liar  Such works may please those who have ne'er been abroad  But men who have travell'd perceive all the fraud  Mrs FELIX  Is the work so deceitful it seems you have read it  DECISIVE  Not a syllable Madam  Mrs FELIX  Pray who then has said it  DECISIVE  Not a soul that I knowbut such books are a trade  And I perfectly know how those volumes are made  Mrs FELIX  'Tis a work I am told that has great reputation  Both for wit and for truth  DECISIVE  We're a credulous nation  Mrs FELIX  Pray what kind of books are your favourite study  DECISIVE  I find modern works only make the brain muddy  As my friends grew by reading more awkward than wise  And ruin'd their persons and clouded their eyes  I have wisely resolv'd not to read any more  Since each living author is turn'd to a  bore  Mrs FELIX  How can you so waste all your bright mental powers  'Tis pity you men have not such works as ours  What d'ye say to my knotting    Takes out her work    DECISIVE  Your box wants a hinge  And I'll give you a much better pattern for fringe  I brought it from France  Mrs FELIX  Now I see my good friend  There is no kind of work which your skill cannot mend  In all arts you possess a distinguishing head  From building a temple to knotting a thread  DECISIVE  Apropos  of a templepray has the good Knight  Rais'd his altar to Panhe had fix'd on the site  Is the structure begunI have not seen his plan  Mrs FELIX  Then hasten and pay your devotions to Pan  Sir Nicholas now in his vestibule stands  To guide all his workmen and quicken their hands  And Sapphic is gone to attend the good Knight  And try what inscription his genius can write  DECISIVE  Poor Pan by the Graces thou'rt left in the lurch  Thy temple will look like a trim parish church  With Sapphic's inscriptions like scraps of the Bible  Put up as the Churchwardens say in a  libel  Mrs FELIX  Indeed we much fear sopray haste to inspect it  And exert all your exquisite taste to correct it  DECISIVE  Ma'am I'll do what I can for it puts me in wrath  To see a fine temple disgrac'd by a Goth  Exit  Mrs FELIX  Well my dear your two Lovers like true men of fashion  Do not pester you much with the heat of their passion  You'll be quite at your easethanks to Pan and the Muse  Enter  Jenny  hastily  JENNY  News news my dear Ladies most excellent news  SELINA  The girl is quite wild  Mrs FELIX  What transports you so Jenny  JENNY  I've news for you Madam that's well worth a guinea  I have news from the Colonel  Mrs FELIX  A letter Where is it  JENNY  No Ma'am here's a stranger arriv'd on a visit  And he comes from the place where the Colonel is fighting  Mrs FELIX  And with letters for me  JENNY  Madam that I'm not right in  For I run from his man when I got half my story  But the Colonel he says is all riches and glory  Mrs FELIX  Dear girl that's enough through my life I shall feel  Due regard for thy warm and affectionate zeal  But where is this Stranger  JENNY  Just walk'd to my Master  His poor man has met with a cruel disaster  He was wounded in battle  SELINA  Pray treat him with care  In your joy my dear Cousin I heartily share  Mrs FELIX  This Stranger's a jewel for you from the East  He's a Captain I hope my dear Jenny at least  JENNY  Ah Madam my fancy suppos'd him so too  But we're both in the wrong and for Miss he won't do  For I learnt from his man he is only a Doctor  Mrs FELIX  Poor Jane how the difference of title has shock'd her  For my part I can't find by my reason or feeling  That the art of destroying excels that of healing  We may equally love the professors of both  JENNY  That Miss tho' should marry a Doctor I'm loth  Mrs FELIX  Come my dear let us meet 'emI can't rest above  How slowly fly letters from hands that we love  End of  ACT I  ACT THE SECOND SCENE I  Enter  Jenny  and  Jonathan  JENNY  COME dear Mr Jonathan tell me the whole  An account of a battle I love to my soul  There is nothing on earth I so truly delight in  As to hear a brave Soldier discourse about fighting  So the Colonel was wounded you say near the wall  Whereabouts was the shot Did he instantly fall  JONATHAN  No recoiling a little he rush'd on again  And fought like a lion made fiercer by pain  Tho' a cursed keen arrow an Indian let fly  Pierc'd the bone of his cheek just below the right eye  'Twas a horrible wound but it could not appal him  JENNY  O mercy that such a hard fate should befal him  Alas I'm afraid that his fine manly face  Must have lost by the fear all its spirit and grace  Does he look very hideous  JONATHAN  No thanks to my Master  You can hardly perceive that he e'er wore a plaister  There never was known a more wonderful cure  But kind Heaven assists my good Master I'm sure  Without it the skill of no mortal could save  The many brave lads he has kept from the grave  You would weep with delight to behold him surrounded  With a hundred fine fellows once horribly wounded  Who with thanks for their lives are still eager to greet him  And hail him with blessings whenever they meet him  JENNY  God reward him say I for the good he has done  And of those he has sav'd I am glad you are one  JONATHAN  Aye twice he preserv'd me when all thought me dead  And once brought me off at the risque of his head  It was not his business to mix in the strife  And some thought him mad when he ventur'd his life  To bring off a poor mangled private like me  But I've still a heart left in this trunk that you see  Which loves the brave spirit who snatch'd me from death  And will serve him I hope till my very last breath  JENNY  Your scenes of hard service I hope are all over  It is now fairly time you should both live in clover  Your Master I trust has brought home as much treasure  As will make him a parliamentman at his pleasure  And to recompence you for the wound in your arm  Perhaps he will buy you a snug little farm  JONATHAN  When a Gentleman comes from the East my good girl  You all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl  You fancy his treasure too great to be told  And suppose he possesses a mountain of gold  A few daring blades by a bold kind of stealth  Have indeed from the Indies brought home so much wealth  That with all their keen senses they ne'er could employ it  And have dy'd from the want of a heart to enjoy it  But some hundred brave lads whom gay youth led to enter  That promising region of hope and adventure  Have toil'd many years in those richburning climes  With small share of their wealth and with none of their crimes  Now my Master and I both belong to this tribe  Not a single Nabob have we kill'd for a bribe  And to tell you a truth which I hope you'll not doubt  We're as poor and as honest as when we set out  JENNY  What your Master still poor in so thriving a trade  And with patients so rich has he never been paid  For the wounds he has heal'd  JONATHAN  Yes my dear for his fees  I know he has touch'd many thousand rupees  But the fight of distress he could never endure  What he took from the rich he bestow'd on the poor  JENNY  Well Heaven will pay him no doubt in due season  But what brings him homeI would fain know the reason  Why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life  I suppose from the want of a cherrycheek'd wife  They say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures  And tho' they've fine shapes they have horrible features  Does he want a white sweetheart or has he a black  JONATHAN  'Tis indeed a white woman that brings us both back  But alas 'tis an old onemy Master it seems  Has a fond simple mother that's troubled with dreams  And he like a tender and softhearted youth  Resigns his fine prospect and comes home forsooth  Because the old dame has express'd her desires  To see him in England before she expires  And egad since he's come she will live long enough  For she seems to be made of good durable stuff  JENNY  Well now I shall love him a hundred times more  Than I did for the stories you told me before  God bless the kind soul who behaves to his mother  As if he well knew he could ne'er have another  And were he my son I could not live without him  I could stay here all day while you're talking about him  But 'tis time to be gone we must both disappear  For the Colonel's sweet Wife and your Master are here  JONATHAN  Stop I must peep at hershe's as bright as the day  JENNY  And her heart is as good as her spirit is gay  Come I'll shew you our walkswe may get out this way  Exeunt  Enter  Mrs Felix  and  Morley  Mrs FELIX  Dear excellent Friend since I owe to your worth  The safety of what I most value on earth  With those it loves best my heart yields you a place  And I clasp your kind hand with a sister's embrace  To judge of the man whom such service endears  I want not the tardy acquaintance of years  But in strong tho' guick ties that no chances can sever  In an instant he seizes my friendship for ever  And had I much less obligation to you  My regard and esteem I should still think your due  From the picture my Felix has drawn of your mind  MORLEY  His warm soul to his friends is most partially kind  But such as I am I most truly am yours  Your goodness my grateful attachment ensures  And my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces  Tho' I ne'er gaz'd before on your personal graces  I've beguil'd some long weeks of hard wearisome duty  With frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty  And I own for the Colonel it rais'd my esteem  To mark with what pleasure he dwelt on the theme  Mrs FELIX  You're an excellent creature to sooth a fond Wife  Who regards her Lord's love hardly less than his life  But since you've replied with good humour so steady  To the ten thousand questions I've ask'd you already  I'll spare you today and if 'tis in my power  Mention Felix's name only once in an hour  That my thoughts to the Indies no longer may roam  Let me talk to you now about matches at home  Your counsel may make our perplexity less  And finish our odd tragicomic distress  First tell me and speak without any disguise  Tho' I fancy I read all your thoughts in your eyes  What d'ye think of my Cousin  MORLEY  Her graces indeed  The glowing description of Felix exceed  Tho' in praising her oft he with pleasure has smil'd  Like a father describing his favourite child  For my part I think she is lavishly blest  With those beauties by which the pure mind is exprest  That her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm  That sweet sensibility shines in her form  A form on which no man his eye ever turn'd  Without feeling his breast in her welfare concern'd  'Tis the lot of such graces wherever they dwell  None can see their soft mistress and not wish her well  Mrs FELIX  Very gallantly said and the praise is her due  But how came her Lovers so well known to you  MORLEY  Her Lovers dear Madam I hope you're in jest  Or if by their vows your sweet Friend is addrest  Heaven grant for the peace of her delicate mind  That her hand may be never to either resign'd  Mrs FELIX  From my soul I assure you I join in your prayer  But whence does it spring  MORLEY  I will freely declare  Tho' they're both men of fortune fair birth and good name  With figures that set some young nymphs in a flame  Tho' at each many ladies are ready to catch  At what the world calls a most excellent match  Yet if I have read your fair Cousin aright  A bosom so tender a spirit so bright  Must be wretched with such a companion for life  As each of these Lovers would prove to his Wife  Mrs FELIX  You are right but their characters where could you know  MORLEY  I knew them at college a few years ago  Before by a whimsical odd sort of fate  And some family losses too long to relate  In Europe my views of prosperity ceas'd  And chance sent me forth to my friends in the East  Mrs FELIX  Pray what sort of youths were these two modish men  MORLEY  You now find them both what they seem'd to be then  Two characters form'd like most young men of fashion  Whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion  In each tho' they're men of an opposite turn  The same heartfreezing vanity still you discern  To indulge that dear vanity each still displays  All the force of his mind tho' in different ways  Thence in spinning weak verse Sapphic's toil never ends  And Decisive ne'er stops in deriding his friends  Each equally fancies no nymph can resist  His lips which he thinks all the Graces have kist  Mrs FELIX  Perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown  The warmth of these Lovers diverts me I own  Of conquest each seems to himself very clear  And feels from his rivals no diffident fear  'Tis easy to see from their satisfied air  Each loves his own person much more than the Fair  But my poor gentle Coz wishes both at a distance  And I want to contrive by your friendly assistance  To relieve her and quietly send them from hence  Without the Knight's knowledge  MORLEY  As neither wants sense  Can't the Lady pronounce their dismission at once  Which none can mistake but an impudent dunce  Mrs FELIX  This measure seems easy indeed at first view  But alas 'tis a measure we dare not pursue  Our warmhearted whimsical positive Knight  Allows not to woman this natural right  And hence my young Friend in a pitiful case  Knows not how to reject what she ne'er can embrace  For nothing her Uncle's resentment would smother  Should she banish one suitor and not take the other  MORLEY  Then indeed I am griev'd for the Lady's distress  But how can I aid her  Mrs FELIX  'Tis hard I confess  To a sudden retreat this bold pair to oblige  And make two such Heroes abandon a siege  Yet I wish we could do itand when they recede  The departure of both must appear their own deed  MORLEY  after a pause  Wellmy friendship for you has suggested a scheme  Mrs FELIX  'Tis a service our hearts will for ever esteem  But what is your project  MORLEY  Don't question me what  Lest you think me a fool for too simple a plot  'Tis simple and yet I would venture my life  It will drive from these Beaus all the thoughts of a Wife  And if my scheme prospers with joy I'll confess  What a whimsical trifle produc'd our success  Mrs FELIX  Well keep your own secret if silence is best  Tho' a woman for once I'll in ignorance rest  Here comes our friend Sapphiche seems in a flurry  MORLEY  His step shews indeed a poetical hurry  And we shall be call'd in as Gossips fair neighbour  For by the Bard's bustle his Muse is in labour  Enter  Sapphic  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am may I ask you for paper and ink  Lest a fresh  jeu d'esprit  in oblivion should sink  For when my free fancy has brought forth my verse  My treacherous memory proves a bad nurse  Mrs FELIX  O pray for your Muse let us rear her young chit  For the bantling no doubt must have spirit and wit  As a cradle to hold it I beg you'll take that  giving him a paper  And your Friend here will aid you in dressing the Brat  At a rite so important I merit no place  And I beg to withdraw while you're washing its face  Exit  SAPPHIC  That's a charming gay Creatureluxuriant and young  But I've lost half a stanzathe deuce take her tongue  Let me seelet me see if I can't recollect it  'Tis doneand now Morley pray hear or inspect it  MORLEY  The Poet himself his own verse should recite  SAPPHIC  You're a sensible fellowyour maxim is right  Reads  "Thy old Arcadia Pan resign  "For this more rich retreat  "A fairer nymph here decks thy shrine  "Be this thy fav'rite seat"  Well my Friend won't this bring the old God out of Greece  MORLEY  Aye and make good Sir Nicholas give you his Niece  SAPPHIC  Yes I fancy this stanza will make the Girl mine  MORLEY  What Poet can wish for a prize more divine  I give you much Joy on your conquest my Friend  Yet the eyes of regret on your nuptials I bend  And grieve in reflecting that conjugal joy  Your poetical harvest of Fame must destroy  SAPPHIC  What the deuce do you mean  MORLEY  To those great works adieu  Which the world now expects with impatience from you  The Poet when blest can no more be sublime  And a chill matrimonial must strike thro' his rhyme  SAPPHIC  You're mistaken dear Doctorconnubial delight  Will give a new zest to each poem I write  And you'll see such productions  MORLEY  'Tis true now and then  Polemics by marriage have quicken'd their pen  A Dutch Critic I knew by the aid of his Wife  Made a book and a child every year of his life  But total seclusion from Venus and Bacchus  Is you know to the Bard recommended by Flaccus  A grand epic poem I hear you are writing  'Tis a work that your country will take great delight in  But consider my Friend when you're deep in heroics  As Poets have not all the patience of Stoics  How you'll grieve to be check'd in the flow of your verse  By a young squalling child and an old scolding nurse  E'en the qualms of your Lady may drive from your brain  Fine thoughts that you ne'er can recover again  Reflect how you'll feel with such hopes of succeeding  If your Muse should miscarry because your Wife's breeding  SAPPHIC  Egad in that case I should think my fate hard  MORLEY  I myself have beheld an unfortunate Bard  Who his nails for a rhyme unsuccessfully bit  When family cares had extinguish'd his wit  With many who sing in the Muse's full choir  It would do them no mischief to muffle their lyre  But for you whom the Nine with a tender presage  Are prepar'd to proclaim the first Bard of our age  For you who of Taste are the favourite theme  SAPPHIC  Yes I think I stand high in the public esteem  MORLEY  For you I should grieve if domestic delight  On your fair rising laurels should fail as a blight  'Tis the pride of great minds whom the Muses inflame  To sacrifice joy on the altar of Fame  Your passion's renownof this Girl are you fonder  On this delicate point I must leave you to ponder  Consider it while I attend the old Knight  Exit  SAPPHIC  alone after a pause  By Jove I believe my friend Morley is right  Thou Fame art my Mistress to win thee I sing  This Girl tho' she's handsome is but a dull thing  'Tis clear whensoe'er I a poem rehearse  That she has no relish for elegant verse  Her fortune indeed would be rather convenient  But the glorious to me is before the expedient  Egad I'd quit Venus herself if I knew  That the system of Morley was certainly true  I don't think the Girl to Decisive inclin'd  But here comes her Maid who may tell me her mind  Enter  Jenny  My good little Jenny you're trusty and true  And your Mistress I know tells her secrets to you  What you know to a friend you may safely impart  And give me a perfect account of her heart  Pray how do I stand in your Lady's regard  JENNY  Now's my time to be even with this saucy Bard    aside    To be sure Sir the taste of my Lady is odd  But poetry moves her no more than a clod  SAPPHIC  What no relish for rhymeDoes she never repeat  The soft little sonnets I've laid at her feet  JENNY  Ah Sir would my Mistress were once of my mind  For I read all the verses of yours that I find  But my Lady's so cruel she thwarts my desire  And to hide them from me throws them into the fire  SAPPHIC  She's a foolshe's a fool    aside    I should have a fine life  With such a prosaic dull jade of a wife  JENNY  But my good Sir I hope you will not be dejected  I could tell you by whom all your wit is respected  There's a heart upon which you have made such impression  But I must not betray her by my indiscretion  SAPPHIC  Whom d' ye mean my good Jenny come tell me my dear  JENNY  You would make a bad use of the secret I fear  Now I hope I shall lead the Bard into a scrape    aside    For he bites like a Gudgeon and cannot escape  SAPPHIC  Come say who's in love with meif she is fair  I'll not leave the dear creature I vow to despair  JENNY  O lud I protest she is coming this way  But I did not intend her regard to betray  I must flybut I beg that you'll not be too free  Exit  SAPPHIC  Madam FelixI thought she was partial to me  Enter  Mrs Felix  Mrs FELIX  May I enter without incommoding the Muse  SAPPHIC  By a question like this your own charms you abuse  Those eyes my dear Madam were form'd I profess  To inspirit a Poet and not to depress  From your presence he surely must catch inspiration  Mrs FELIX  A very poetical fine salutation  But I seriously beg if you're busy with rhyme  That you will not allow me to take up your time  As I'm not Selina you're free from restriction  And may tell me plain truths unembellish'd with fiction  SAPPHIC  Then I swear my dear Creature I swear by this hand  That I feel as I touch it my genius expand  That your lipsO by Jove he's a madman or booby  Who roves to the Indies for diamond or ruby  And each vein in my heart his strange folly condemns  Who leaves these more bright and more exquisite gems  Sweet Fair let me keep while their richness I praise  The cold damp of neglect from o'erclouding their rays    While  Mr Sapphic  kisses  Mrs Felix  with great vehemence  Jenny  enters unperceived    JENNY  O hohave I caught you impertinent Poet  This is more than I hop'd formy Master shall know it  Exit  Mrs FELIX  Good God Mr Sapphic what frantic illusion  Has produc'd this ridiculous scene of confusion  All Poets are Quixotes in love I am told  And the truth of the adage in you I behold  As the Knight once mistook an old mill for a giant  Your sense as disorder'd your fancy as pliant  Takes me for my Cousinyour love's ebullition  I only can pardon on this supposition  I fain would suppose that no insult was meant  Nor believe you could think what I ought to resent  SAPPHIC  O talk not of anger with lips that inspire  The strongest sensation of rapturous fire  That with love's sweet convulsions shake every nerve  O think not that I your resentment deserve  Because my warm heart thus engross'd by your charms  Is ambitious of filling these dear empty arms  No let me while basking beneath your bright eye  The place of a thankless deserter supply  And in this melting breast kindle ecstacy's flame  Which Nature design'd for so glowing a frame  Mrs FELIX  Away Sir and since in your fondling insanity  You reject the excuse which I form'd for your vanity  My threats must inform you  SAPPHIC  O frown not sweet Creature  Let not wrath spoil the charm of thy every feature  Mrs FELIX  Regain you your sensefrom my wrath you are free  Which should not be rais'd by a being like thee  Begone thenmy pardon in vain you'll implore  If you dare on this subject to breathe a word more  SAPPHIC  Words indeed my warm fair one by Nature's confession  For the love that I feel are no proper expression  The soul's fond intent in soft murmurs should swell  And kisses explain what no language can tell  Ye Gods how luxuriant  Mrs FELIX  Away quit my arm  Or my cries in an instant the house shall alarm  SAPPHIC  Provoking sweet Creature indulge my fond passion  Come come don't I know you're a woman of fashion  Your coyness I've heard you can sometimes give over  And I'm sure you're too wise to be true to a rover  Besides I have learnt that with partial regard  You have cast a kind eye on your illtreated Bard  Mrs FELIX  Away thou vain coxcomb nor base as thou art  Insult the bright Lord of so loyal a heart  BegoneI abhor theemy person release  Sir NICHOLAS  entering  Is it thus my young Sir you pay court to my Niece  SAPPHIC  Confusion What devil has sent the old Knight  Sir NICHOLAS  How dare you pert stripling almost in my sight  To insult a chaste Female that's under my roof  But since of your baseness you give me such proof  You shall feel it repaid by a proper correction  SAPPHIC    aside    Deuce take this perverse and unlucky detection  I wish I had wisely as Morley had taught me  Renounc'd that jade Venus before he thus caught me  What excuse can I make him    To  Sir Nicholas  My dear worthy Sir  Tho' I now seem most justly your wrath to incur  Yet as you grow cool your opinion will vary  You will not resent much an idle vagary  A mere romping frolic  Sir NICHOLAS  A frolic d'ye say  Then a frolic of mine shall your frolic repay  Call our Servants to punish this frolic some Spark  They shall drag him across the new pond in the park  SAPPHIC    aside    'Tis what he can't meanyet his countenance such is  I wish from my soul I was out of his clutches    To  Sir Nicholas  Dear Sir I assure you I'm griev'd beyond measure  That I thus have awaken'd your furious displeasure  When calmer  Sir NICHOLAS  Young Man I am not in a fury  A sentence more just never came from a jury  Such frolics as yours have Old England disgrac'd  In High Life let them flourish as Fashion and Taste  To those wanton young fellows I am not severe  Who attack the loose Wife of a vain gambling Peer  My Lady whose Lord wastes at Hazard the night  May plead to more generous pleasures some right  I care not how each keeps their conjugal oath  Since honour and peace must be strangers to both  But when a brave Soldier pure Glory's true son  Ennobled with laurels laboriously won  When risking in far distant climates his life  To his Country he leaves a fair innocent Wife  Accurst be the man who to Friendship unjust  Fails to guard as his soul this most delicate trust  Or to punish those Pops who insult her chaste beauty  And invite her to swerve from her honour and duty  Of the doom that I think to such Libertines due  I will give to the world an example in you  Our old English discipline Ducking by name  Shall atone for your outrage by quenching your flame  Here William and John  Mrs FELIX  For my sake I intreat  That you will not dear Sir this rough vengeance compleat  Sir NICHOLAS  By Jupiter Cousin to make him less fond  He shall croak out his love to the frogs of our pond  Here William tell Jack after Stephen to skip  And tell the old Huntsman to come with his whip  Then wait all together around the hall door  SAPPHIC  O mercy dear Sir I your mercy implore  You will not destroy me  Sir NICHOLAS  No only correct  And teach you a brave Soldier's Wife to respect  Mrs FELIX  Yet think my dear Cousin yet think for my sake  What a noise this ridiculous matter will make  You know that my Felix's nature is such  He don't wish his Wife to be talk'd of too much  His honour and quiet let us make our care  And bury in silence this foolish affair  Perhaps in my manners too easy and gay  My levity led the young Poet astray  Sir NICHOLAS  No no my good Creature you must not arraign  Your innocent self in a business so plain  Besides his offence by this plea cannot sink  For they are the worst of all puppies that think  Each woman's a wanton who is not precise  And that cheerfulness must be the herald of vice  Mrs FELIX  Howe'er this may beas he's now all repentance  I earnestly beg a repeal of your sentence  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am I adore you for this intercession  And I trust the good Knight will forgive my transgression  Sir NICHOLAS  Well Sir as beyond your desert you're befriended  By that virtue which you have so grossly offended  You are free to depart but remember young Swain  That you ne'er touch the Wife of a Soldier again  SAPPHIC  If I do may I die by the wind of a ball  Heaven bless you good Folks and this sociable hall  Since my amorous folly your friendship thus loses  My amours shall henceforth be confin'd to the Muses  Exit  Mrs FELIX  I thank you dear Sir and rejoice in my heart  That in safety you've suffer'd this Youth to depart  Sir NICHOLAS  By Jupiter Coz I had cool'd your warm Poet  Had I not been afraid all our neighbours might know it  And make you the subject of such conversation  As I think your nice Colonel would hear with vexation  Then since for your sake I have let the Bard go  Come and aid me to settle all matters below  That my anxious cares in her comfort may cease  I'm resolv'd young Decisive shall marry my niece  End of  ACT II  ACT THE THIRD SCENE I  Enter  Mrs Felix  and  Selina  Mrs FELIX  WELL my dear what d'ye think of our medical friend  Whom the letters of Felix so highly commend  If my gratitude does not my judgment mislead  He's the man in the world who with you might succeed  Tho' gentle yet manly tho' bashful polite  Are you not half in love  SELINA  Yes indeed at first sight  His service to you on my heart is engrav'd  And I love him I own for the life he has sav'd  To win me perhaps he might not find it hard  So esteem'd as he is by the friends I regard  But I fancy such thoughts will not enter his brain  And for my part instead of attracting a Swain  I only shall think as they heartily vex me  Of escaping from those who already perplex me  Mrs FELIX  O make yourself easy I pray on that head  In the deepest disgrace the poor Poet is fled  And I trust that the Critic will soon share his fate  Come with meI've a most curious tale to relate  Let us hasteI perceive that Decisive is near  In whose present discourse I would not interfere  Exeunt  Enter  Decisive  and  Morley  DECISIVE  So while in the grove I was coolly projecting  New plans for the temple the Knight is erecting  Our Poet addicted to amorous sin  Grew a little too fond of the Ladies within  But discovery happen'd his passion to damp  And this is the cause of his haste to decamp  MORLEY  The old Knight I believe such resentment express'd  As quicken'd the speed of his fugitive guest  On Terror's swift wing he is certainly flown  And as he has retreated the field is your own  DECISIVE  As a rival I had not much fear of poor Sapphic  Bad rhyme's current coin in most amorous traffic  But would not pass here  MORLEY  I think not in your view  As it finds such a critical touchstone in you  The Poet's dismission your triumph ensures  And the prize my good friend is now certainly yours  A prize that we justly may call very great  A lovely sweet Girl with a noble estate  DECISIVE  The Girl's very well but knows nothing of life  It will cost me some pains to new model my Wife  But I think she will gladly receive my correction  And my wealthy old Kinsman approve the connection    Coughs    MORLEY  You've a cough my good Friend  DECISIVE  Yes a trifling one  Hem  Have you got any Indian prescription for phlegm  MORLEY  Believe me that cough is no trifling affair  It calls I assure you for caution and care  With regret I point out so unpleasant a truth  But your constitution I've known from your youth  Your hectic appearance I see with concern  As I know with your frame if health takes such a turn  The least indiscretion your life may destroy  The slightest excess in diversion and joy  Even those tender cares which on life's purest plan  Must belong to the state of a Family Man  May lead to disease from which art cannot save  And rapidly hurry you into the grave  'Twere better this courtship of yours should miscarry  For you'll certainly die in six months if you marry  DECISIVE  Are you serious dear Doctor  MORLEY  By such a sad end  I lately have lost a poor goodhumour'd friend  You remember Jack Dangle at College no doubt  He was just of your age and a little more stout  He with other young sages left Westminster Hall  To teach English law to the slaves of Bengal  But Jack in his new chamberpractice at least  Too eagerly follow'd the rules of the East  A bad cough ensu'd much like yours in its found  Decisive  coughs  Good God I could swear 'twas poor Jack under ground  'Tis his tone so exactly sepulchral and hollow  The system he slighted I hope you will follow  With pains in his breast he was sharply tormented  But as he at first to my guidance consented  Some time my strict regimen kept him alive  Poor Dangle once more was beginning to thrive  And had he some months in my plan persever'd  On the earth at this moment he might have appear'd  But chance threw a pretty white girl in his way  And eager for marriage fond Jack would not stay  In vain I conjur'd him to wait half a year  And shew'd him the danger he ran very clear  He thought the remains of his cough but a trifle  And being unable his passion to stifle  He took his fair wifebut alas the vile cough  Encreas'd every day till it carried him off  DECISIVE  I don't recollect any pain in my breast  But I feel a strange tightness just now in my chest  MORLEY  How's your stomach  DECISIVE  I've nothing to fear on that score  MORLEY  Do you eat as you did  DECISIVE  Yes I think rather more  MORLEY  That ravenous hunger's the thing that I dread  How d'ye sleep  DECISIVE  All the time that I pass in my bed  MORLEY  IndeedI don't like so lethargic a slumber  DECISIVE  Why my Friend of good symptoms these rank in the number  MORLEY  Alas you may call them all good if you please  By that title you only confirm your disease  In which tho' the patient declines very fast  He for ever will flatter himself to the last  Believe me your symptoms are rather alarming  Yet your present disorder there is not much harm in  If you can but abstain with a spirit resign'd  From all that may harrass your body or mind  To a different climate I wish you'd repair  And for one Winter breathe a less changeable air  Spend a Christmas at Naples and when you return  You may marry without any anxious concern  But you're now at that critical period of life  When in such frames as yours nature feels an odd strife  And if quiet does not all her functions befriend  The short earthly scene on a sudden will end  On a point so important you'll pardon my freedom  DECISIVE  Your cautions oblige me I feel that I need 'em  For in truth I am growing as thin as a rabbit  And there's something consumptive I know in my habit  My father died soon after taking a Wife  And cough'd out his soul when I jump'd into life  I suppose I am going  MORLEY  Take courage my Friend  On your own prudent conduct your life will depend  If you take but due care for two years I'll engage  You will stand a fair chance for a healthy old age  Nor would I advise you this Girl to refuse  A distant attachment your mind will amuse  And no doubt for a man of your fortune and figure  She will wait till your health has recover'd its vigour  DECISIVE  I can part with the Girl without feeling a chasm  In my heart that will shake with no amorous spasm  For to tell you the truth my old rich Uncle Cob  Is more eager than I for this marrying job  By this scheme the old Blade is supremely delighted  Because two large manors may thus be united  But when of his park I've extended the bound  It will do me small good if I sink under ground  And I'm not such a fool in these projects of pelf  To humour my friends and endanger myself  MORLEY  Indeed I'd not wed for an old Uncle's whim  But here comes our Knight I shall leave you with him  As I think you've some delicate points to adjust  Exit  DECISIVE  alone  I'm in no haste to sleep with my Ancestor's dust  'Tis wiser my weak constitution to save  Than to marry and so travel post to the grave  Enter  Sir Nicholas  Sir NICHOLAS  Come give me your hand and rejoice my young Neighbour  You're the man that's to order the pipe and the tabor  And by Jove we'll all dance on so joyous a day  Your wedding dear Dick shall be speedy and gay  For your Rival is gone with our serious displeasure  And I give to your wishes my young lovely Treasure  A treasure she is tho' the Girl is my Niece  Heaven grant ye long years of affection and peace  And a fine chopping Boy ere the end of the first  Remember that I am to see the rogue nurs'd  Go you happy young dog go and seal with a kiss  And teach the old hall to reecho your bliss  As I know on this match what Sir Jacob intends  And we can so well trust each other as friends  Short contracts will answer as well as the best  Our lawyers at leisure may finish the rest  I know all suspence in such cases is hard  And you shall not I swear from your bliss be debar'd  While o'er acres of parchment they're crawling like snails  DECISIVE  Dear Sir upon weighing in Reason's just scales  Your very great favours and my weak pretension  I find I'm unworthy of such condescension  And must with regret the high honour resign  Which I once vainly thought might with justice be mine  Sir NICHOLAS  Heyday what does all this formality mean  Why Dick has the Devil possess'd you with spleen  Or has Love made your mind thus with diffidence sore  False modesty ne'er was your foible before  You think you're unworthythe thought is so new  That I hardly can tell what to say or to do  If you love the good Girl full as much as you said  I think you have very just claims to her bed  But if your mind's chang'd and you feel your love lighter  'Tis better to say so than marry and slight her  And if this be the  ▪ Sir you have your release  For although I am eager to marry my Niece  Tho' I'm partial to you yet I beg you to note  That I don't want to cram her down any man's thtoat  DECISIVE  I'm truly convinc'd of the Lady's perfection  And 'twould plea  e d  ar Sir to preserve the connection  Tho' now by particular reasons am led  To revisit the Continent once ere I wed  In the time of my absence I can't be exact  But in what form you please I will freely contract  In the course of two years to receive as my Wife  Sir NICHOLAS  Do you mean to insult me you Puppy Od'slife  Ere I'd tie my dear Girl to so silly a Fop  For life I'd condemn her to trundle a mop  And let me advise you young man for the future  To know your own mind ere you go as a suitor  DECISIVE  I perceive Sir my presence grows irksome to you  And you'll therefore allow me to bid you adieu  Sir NICHOLAS  Your departure indeed I don't wish to restrain  And have little concern when I see you again  Exit  Decisive  Sir NICHOLAS  alone  What can make this pert Puppy recede from his suit  My fair Cousin and he have scarce had a dispute  She would hardly affront him on purpose to vex me  Here she comes to explain all the points that perplex me  Enter  Mrs Felix  Well Cousin my scheme for a wedding's suspended  The Beaux are both gone and their courtship is ended  With an air so mysterious Decisive withdraws  I a little suspect you're concern'd as the cause  Confess have you had any words with this Youth  Mrs FELIX  Not I my dear Sir on my honour and truth  But I'm ready to own that the news you impart  With surprize and with pleasure enlivens my heart  I think your sweet Niece has a lucky escape  I would almost as soon see her marry an ape  As her union with one of these Coxcombs behold  The Bard is too warm and the Critic too cold  Sir NICHOLAS  I find that they are not such Lads as I thought 'em  The World all the worst of its fashions has taught 'em  And the World is indeed at a very fine pass  When such Puppies insult so attractive a Lass  Young Fellows of fortune now think it hard duty  To pay a chaste homage to Virtue and Beauty  But I'll leave these pert Fops to their own vile caprice  And soon find a much fitter match for my Niece  Other orders of men for a husband I'll search  And I think I can settle my Girl in the Church  Mrs FELIX  Lord Cousin I thought you detested the Cloth  Sir NICHOLAS  Our Rector I own often kindles my wrath  But all Parsons are not like my neighbour old Squabble  Who has learnt from his geese both to hiss and to gobble  We have in our neighbourhood three young Divines  And each I believe to Selina inclines  Our Bishop's smart Nephew deserves a sweet Wench  He himself in due time may be rais'd to the Bench  With him I should like very well to unite her  And if he hereafter should rise to the Mitre  Then perhaps we together might bring to perfection  A muchwanted plan for the Church's correction  Mrs FELIX  A very fine scheme which you'll manage no doubt  Sir NICHOLAS  More wonderful things I have known brought about  And tho' my first plan as you see has miscarried  I'm resolv'd that my Niece shall be speedily married  I'll unite the good Girl to a Priest if I'm able  For the young Olive Branch never fails at his table  There is one I preferbut to leave the Girl free  I allow her to make a fair choice of the Three  I shall therefore invite the whole groupe to the hall  And I'll now go and make her write cards to them all  Exit  Mrs FELIX  alone  What a wonderful creature is this worthy Knight  To make others happy is all his delight  Yet misled by some wild philanthropic illusion  He's for ever involv'd in odd scenes of confusion  'Tis well that our Critic has made his last bow  I rejoice he's remov'd and I long to know how  Enter  Morley  MORLEY  Thank my stars my dear Ma'am I've dispatch'd your commission  Your sweet Friend is I hope in a tranquil condition  From her two irksome Lovers she now is reliev'd  Mrs FELIX  And I'm dying to know how all this was atchiev'd  Come tell me good Creature how could you effect it  MORLEY  By a project so simple you'd never suspect it  I have banish'd both Swains by declaring a Wife  Would rob one of glory and t'other of life  I persuaded the Bard his poetical fame  Could never exist with a conjugal flame  Hence he grew with your charms so licentiously free  But forgive me this ill which I could not foresee  Decisive more wisely abandons the Fair  To make his own lungs his particular care  Mrs FELIX  What on such points as these have they taken your word  MORLEY  Dear Madam mankind credit things most absurd  When they come from the mouth of a medical man  Hence Mountebanks never want skill to trepan  The extent of our empire indeed there's no seeing  When we act on the fears of a true selfish being  Mrs FELIX  How simple soever the means you've employ'd  You have remedy'd ills by which we were annoy'd  Having thus clear'd the scene from each troublesome Lover  Can you not for the Nymph a fit Husband discover  You see how she's prest by her Uncle to wed  Who ne'er quits a scheme he once takes in his head  Suppose her kind fancy should lean towards you  Is your heart quite as free as I'm sure 'twould be true  Is it not preengag'd  MORLEY  As in mirth's sportive sally  It pleases you thus a poor pilgrim to rally  Your good nature I know will forgive me if I  To your pleasantry make a too serious reply  'Tis my maxim to speak whatsoe'er be the theme  With a heart undisguis'd to the friends I esteem  Had I all India's wealth 'twould be my inclination  To offer it all to your lovely Relation  But supposing it possible you could be willing  To unite her with one who is scarce worth a shilling  Believe me dear Madam my pride is too great  To wish her to stoop to my humble estate  Mrs FELIX  Such pride tho' it rests upon no strong foundation  Is noble I own and deserves admiration  I call it illfounded because in my mind  If there's fortune enough for a couple when join'd  If talents and worth are by each duly shar'd  If in all other points they are equally pair'd  And mutual regard mutual merit enhances  It signifies not which supply'd their finances  MORLEY  Your pardonhow often when fortune's unequal  Gay weddings produce a most turbulent sequel  But could I once hope your sweet Cousin to gain  How many things are there such hopes to restrain  Suppose your dear Colonel my most noble Friend  Whom success to your arms may more speedily send  Suppose having clos'd the bright work he has plann'd  His return from the East he should hasten by land  Suppose him arriv'd with what face could I meet  The man whom my heart should exultingly greet  If he found me attempting in spite of my station  To wed tho' a beggar your wealthy Relation  Mrs FELIX  From these words my dear Friend which I almost adore  And a few slighter hints that escap'd you before  I have caught a quick hope which is fraught with delight  That I soon shall be blest with my Felix's sight  I begin to suspect he's in England already  I perceive that you can't keep your countenance steady  With his usual attention his love has reflected  How my poor foolish nerves by surprise are affected  And lest they should fail me beyond all revival  Has sent you to prepare for his wish'dfor arrival  Am I right in my guess Is he not very near  Could I trust my own heart I should think Felix here  COLONEL FELIX  entering  Sweet Foreboder behold him restor'd to your arms  Mrs FELIX  O my Felix this transport o'erpays all alarms  Thus to see thee restor'd and ennobled with fame  In what words shall affection thy welcome proclaim  COLONEL  My love my blest Treasure than glory more dear  The bliss of this meeting which shines in thy tear  That we owe to this Friend let us never forget  MORLEY  My share in your transport o'erpays all the debt  But Colonel your fondness has travell'd full speed  And has not allow'd me the time you agreed  COLONEL  I meant not indeed to have join'd you tod  y  But I found Love forbade my intended delay  MORLEY  Well my duty is done now you happily meet  Heaven bless you together  Mrs FELIX  Stay stay I entreat  You must not go yet and before you depart  I will open to Felix the scheme of my heart  SELINA    behind the scene    Indeed Sir I never can write such a card  Sir NICHOLAS  behind the scene    Then you'll forfeit at once my paternal regard  COLONEL  Heyday in the house I much fear something's wrong  As Sir Nicholas talks in a language so strong  Mrs FELIX  Does he know you are here  COLONEL  No my Dear I think not  Unless he the tidings from Jenny has got  She alone saw me come and without much ado  Most kindly directed me where to find you  Mrs FELIX  They are coming this waylet's withdraw all together  And contrive how to turn this loud storm to fair weather  Exeunt  Enter  Sir Nicholas  and  Selina  Sir NICHOLAS  I insist on your writing such cards to 'em all  SELINA  Dear Uncle I beg you'll this order recall  You know your commands I much wish to obey  But reflect on this matter what people will say  You're so eager to marry your Niece they will swear  That you hawk her about just like goods at a fair  Sir NICHOLAS  Well my Dear let 'em say so and I'll say so too  For your simile proves what a Guardian should do  He who wants to dispose of a tender young maid  May take a good hint from the gingerbread trade  If he has any sense 'twill be ever his plan  To part with soft pastry as soon as he can  For egad an old maid is like old harden'd paste  You may cry it about but nobody will taste  Come do as I bid you and take up your pen  SELINA  Lord Sir it will seem very odd to these men  You will make me appear in a horrible light  I vow my hand shakes so I never can write  Excuse me dear Sir from this business pray do  And let me live single for ever with you  Sir NICHOLAS  All business where woman's concern'd I believe  Must partake of the curse from our Grandmother Eve  All her Daughters the steps of their Parent have follow'd  Contradiction the core of the apple she swallow'd  In their veins still fermenting new ills can produce  And all their blood seems Coloquintida juice  You froward cross Baggage your word should I take  And bid you live single five years for my sake  Of the barbarous Uncle you'd quickly complain  Who from Nature's just right a young Girl wou'd restrain  SELINA  Indeed Sir I should not  Sir NICHOLAS  I tell you you wou'd  From perverseness alone you oppose your own good  'Tis only to thwart me because I desire  To see you well settled before I expire  That you now with your soft hypocritical carriage  Affect to have no inclination to marriage  But you'll never contrive tho' your tongue may be nimble  To convince me your heart is as cold as your thimble  I know of what stuff froward damsels are made  The Guardian must force you who cannot persuade  That you'll like a good husband I never can doubt  And married you shall be before the month's out  Or at least your kind Uncle no more you shall teaze  But may e'en go to Rome and turn Nun if you please  SELINA    aside    I have lost all the love he has shewn me for years  If I strive to reply I shall burst into tears  Sir NICHOLAS  Come answer me Miss will you scribble or not  Enter the  Colonel Mrs Felix  and  Morley  COLONEL  My worthy old Friend what can make you so hot  Sir NICHOLAS  Ha Colonelyou find me a little concern'd  But I'm heartily glad you are safely return'd  Your arrival indeed is a welcome surprize  Tho' before you your fame a bright harbinger flies  We have heard your success and we all triumph in it  COLONEL  I trust I am come in a fortunate minute  To make all your present embarrassment cease  For I bring a young Husband my Friend for your Niece  Sir NICHOLAS  Egad that's well said and I'm sure it's well meant  And if he's like you he shall have my consent  COLONEL  He has many more virtues and just as much wealth  And from India brings home both his morals and health  Here my Friend is the ManAs I owe him my life  I wish to present him so lovely a Wife  Half my fortune is hishere I freely declare it  And have only to hope that Selina may share it  I've regarded her long as a child of my own  Nor can my affection more truly be shown  Than by wishing to place the dear Girl in the arms  Of the friend whose rare virtues are worthy her charms  MORLEY  Dear generous Felix I'm quite overcome  Thy Bounty is such it strikes Gratitude dumb  COLONEL  This was ever my Friend my most settled intention  Though my very just purpose I chose not to mention  From the hope I should find what I gladly embrace  A moment from which it may borrow some grace  When my gift its plain value may rise far above  By the aid it affords to the wishes of Love  And I own as a prophet I'm proud of my art  Now I see the effects of her charms on your heart  MORLEY  O Felix can I thus deprive thy free spirit  Of wealth the reward of heroical merit  Can I the victorious Commander despoil  Of what he has purchas'd with danger and toil▪  Should love and delight on thy present attend  I could never be happy in robbing a Friend  No I still must decline  Sir NICHOLAS  My dear Boy say no more  You're the match that I never could meet with before  I have long sought in vain for an heir to my mind  But all my soul wish'd in your spirit I find  You shall  not  rob your Friend of a single  An Indian Coin  Gold Mohr  He can raise heirs enough to inherit his store  To such men as himself let him haste to give birth  And with twenty young Felixs garnish the earth  How trifling soever your fortune may be  From the Colonel's esteem and the virtues I see  I think you as noble a match for my Niece  As I could had you brought home a new golden fleece  I have money enough if you're rich in affection  As I always have talk'd of an equal connection  My neighbours perhaps may suppose my sight dim  Or mock my wise choice as a generous whim  Let them study with zeal which I hope may succeed  Of their horses and dogs to improve the best breed  A study more noble engrosses my mind  To preserve the first points in the breed of mankind  On the heart and the soul as the first points I dwell  In these my dear Children you match mighty well  And I think human nature in debt to my care  For uniting two mortals who happily pair  COLONEL  Your hand my dear Knight it is gloriously said  Sir NICHOLAS  By Juno we'll put the young couple to bed  We'll have no dull delays  Mrs FELIX  Now what say you my Dear  Are these orders for marriage too quick and severe  MORLEY  My amazement and gratitude both are extreme  But my voice seems opprest in a heavenly dream  Though your kindness is greater than language can paint  I beg this fair hand may be free from constraint  Sir NICHOLAS  From constraintGad if now she affects to demur  I can tell her my wrath she shall so far incur  She shall go to a convent for life or at least  Be sent as a venture herself to the East  SELINA  My Uncle I long have obey'd and at present  I cannot complain his commands are unpleasant  Nay more could he place all mankind in my view  And bid me chuse from them my choice would be you  MORLEY  To this dear declaration my life must reply  All words are too weak  Sir NICHOLAS  The whole earth I defy  To shew me a scene more delightful than this  Dear honest frank Girl come and give me a kiss  Thou'rt the creature of Nature much more than of Art  And I own thee again as the child of my heart  JONATHAN  entering and speaking to the  Colonel  There are two chests for you Sir just come to the hall  COLONEL  A few Indian things for the Ladiesthat's all  Pray Jonathan pay those who brought them with this  Giving money  MORLEY  My brave lad must share in our general bliss  Here Jonathan if you're to marriage inclin'd  And can luckily meet with a girl to your mind  You may marry and settle as soon as you please  The Colonel has taken good care of your ease  JONATHAN  God bless him whate'er he is pleas'd to bestow  I think I have found a kind sweetheart below  Mrs FELIX  He has made choice of Jennyand I will provide  A fortune my Friend for your goodhumour'd Bride  Sir NICHOLAS  Egad they shall have my new farm on the hill  And raise young recruits there as fast as they will  JONATHAN  Heaven prosper you all I will pray for you ever  And to serve my King still as I can I'll endeavour  Exit  Sir NICHOLAS  Well said honest Soldier we'll have no delay  Go and tell the old Parson to keep in the way  COLONEL  Come with me fair Cousin examine my chests  I long to present you a few bridal vests  Mrs FELIX  to  Morley  As we view with delight the events of today  A fair lesson my Friend in your fate we survey  While from love to an aged fond parent with speed  From wealth's open road you most kindly recede  Heaven sends you that fortune you nobly have slighted  And your warm filial piety here is requited  This bright moral truth by your lot is exprest  "They who seek others' bliss are by Providence blest"  Sir NICHOLAS  to  Morley  Here my worthy young Friend take and cherish this Fair  And trust me you'll find her deserving your care  For although of her sex she may have a small spice  She'll please you ten times where she vexes you twice  And happy the man in this skirmishing life  Who is able to say half as much of his Wife
