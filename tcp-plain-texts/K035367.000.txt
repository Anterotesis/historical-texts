 A DECLARATION OF THE People's Natural Right to a Share in the Legislature  c  A DECLARATION OF THE PEOPLE'S NATURAL RIGHT TO A SHARE IN THE LEGISLATURE Which is the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION OF STATE  By GRANVILLE SHARP  Qui non libere veritatem pronunciat prodi∣tor est veritatis  Inst Epil  LONDON Printed for B WHITE at HORACE'SHEAD in FLEETSTREET  MDCCLXXIV  PREFACE  THE following  Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legislature  is founded on Principles which are cer∣tainly unquestionable and cannot easily be controverted but I was not aware I acknowledge  I freely acknowledge my deficiency in  historical  as well as most other branches of Learning which re∣quire much reading and leisure to be obtained but though this affords an argument against  my own perso∣nal credit and abilities in general  as a writer yet it does not at all affect any particular point which in my se∣veral tracts I have laboured to maintain for upon these a candid Reader will determine according to the evidence produced and not by the general character or  demerit  of the Author in other respects  when I sent the same to the Press that there had ever been any Controversy before the th of King George I concerning the Freedom of our fellowsubjects in  Ireland  or that any Englishman acquainted with the principles of our excellent Constitution of State had ever before that time presumed to advance any doctrine which might tend to deprive our Irish Brethren  of their  natural Freedom  and of the in∣estimable benefits of that happy legal Constitution which British Subjects in general are commonly supposed to inhe∣rit by  Birthright  If I had not esteemed this point  incon∣trovertible  when I wrote the said  Decla∣ration  I should not have quoted the Union between  Great Britain  and  Ire∣land  as an example of  the true constitu∣tional  mode of  connecting British Do∣minions  that are otherwise  separated by nature  But having done this and having also given several copies of the Declaration to my friends which cannot now be recalled I have thereby brought upon myself the necessity of maintaining the propriety of the said example which might as easily have been avoided had I been aware of any such controversy be∣cause the general principles on which my arguments are founded would have been amply sufficient I apprehend to prove the truth of my  Declaration  even though  Examples  and  Custom  had been against it for the Common Law of  England  teaches us that examples and precedents are not to be followed if they are  unreasonable  or inconsistent with  legal  and  constitutional  Principles  This is clearly proved by a variety of unques∣tionable maxims  Judicandum est  Legibus non Exemplis  Malus usus abolendus est  In consuetudinibus non diuturnitas temporis sod  soliditas rationis  consideranda est  Multitudo  errantium  non parit  errori  patroci∣nium  though on the other hand they are to be esteemed of very great weight and authority in Law when there are  no just exceptions  against them  et quia consuetudines illae  nec contra legem divinam nec contra rationem  in aliquo existunt et pro bono communi totius Regni ex earum diurni∣tate censentur fore necessariae  vim Legis retinent  c  Doct et Stud c  And of this latter kind is the Example which I have quoted to illustrate my Declara∣tion for though many great and respec∣table Writers have made  exceptions  to the constitutional Freedom of  Ireland  which I had supposed to be unquestionable yet after the most careful examination of their opinions and the  reasons  given for the same in which the proofs ought to consist I am now fully convinced that there are  no just exceptions  against that example and consequently I am bound in justice to my fellowsubjects in  Ireland  not to give it up because the  "necessity"  beforementioned  of main∣taining the  propriety of the example  ci∣ted in my Declaration arises not from any obstinate partiality to my own as∣sertion which I confess was at first too hastily and unadvisedly made but from a firm persuasion after a most cautious enquiry into the real state of the controversy that the advocates for the Liberties of  Ireland  have Truth and Rea∣son on their side which I hope the d Part now added to my Declaration will sufficiently testify  It is necessary also for me to guard against another objection which might perhaps hereafter have been started a∣gainst the following  Declaration  I have quoted therein a maxim of the English Constitution as a principle of  natural equity  which had previously been denied that rank by one of the most eminent civilians of his time and there∣fore to avoid the influence of so great an authority against my Argument I think it prudent in this Preface to examine the grounds of his objections that my Readers may have sufficient evidence be∣fore them to distinguish where the truth lies for it is certainly necessary for me  to establish the first  principles  on which I have proceeded before I can expect to have any attention paid to the Arguments which I have built upon them  The maxim which I wish to maintain is as follows  viz  that  Law to bind all must be assented to by all  Principia Leg et Aequit p to which is added by way of illustration  Canons therefore bind not the Laity    This maxim I have quoted in the following Declaration as a principle of  natural Equity  though it seems the learned Civilian Baron Puffendorf has expressly refused to rank it with the  Laws of Na∣ture  He or rather I should say his Translator calls  The Edition which I have followed is only an English translation printed at Oxford in  it only  a notion  "We cannot here but observe" says he  that the  Notion  maintained by some authors  That the Consent of the People is requisite to make Laws oblige the Subject in Conscience  is neither true  in the Laws of Nature  nor in the civil Laws of monarchical or of aristo∣cratical Rulers nor indeed at all un∣less it be understood of implicit con∣sent as a man by agreeing to the  Sovereignty of another is at the same time supposed to have agreed to all the future Acts of that Sovereignty  Law of Nature and Nations Book c p    He has nevertheless thought proper to add an observation which makes strongly against his own argument "Though it would really be very useful" says he  and contribute much to engaging the Subjects in a  voluntary Obedience  if the Laws could be made  with their Consent  and Approbation especially such as are to pass into their Lives and Manners  Now it would be impossible I appre∣hend to find so just a reason in favour of the former part of the learned Baron's assertion as he himself has here given  directly against it  and yet he is frequent∣ly harping upon the same harsh string of absolute implicit obedience which in∣consistency cannot easily be accounted for unless it be attributed to  the prejudice of his education  as a student in  the Impe∣perial or Civil Law  For though the Civil Law contains many excellent max∣ims highly worthy of our esteem most of which have been adopted by our an∣cient  English writers of the Common Law of this Kingdom  What use our ancestors have made of the civil Law will readily appear to any one that will take the trouble to compare the several works which com∣pose that voluminous body with some of the most ancient English Lawyers as Glanvil Bracton and others who have adhered very closely to the rules and method of Justinian have transcribed his Laws in their own proper language and some∣times entire titles as familiarly as if they were the original Laws of England  Dr Bever's Discourse on the Study of Jurisprudence and the Civil Law p  yet it includes some heterogeneous positions that have been forced upon it by the overbearing influence and corrupt practices of unli∣mited Imperial Courts which are highly unreasonable and contradictory to the ge∣neral equity of its other principles A position of this kind too implicitly re∣ceived as Law seems to be the groundwork of the learned Baron's difficulty I mean that  unreasonable  and dangerous position of the Civil Law which attri∣butes to the Prince's  Will and Pleasure  the  Force  of Law  Quod Principi placuit juxta Leges Civiles Legis habet vigorem  Fortescue de Laud Leg Ang c p  In this same chapter the learned Chancellor Fortes∣cue recites many dreadful effects of this abominable  principle in the Government and Police of  France  viz the pernicious and dangerous Policy of maintain∣ing a  standing army  for which the people were com∣pelled to provide quarters and provisions in all the great towns and villages  Also the abominable oppression of the Salt Tax whereby the poor were compelled to purchase of the King a certain quantity of  Salt  whether they chose to have it or not at an excessive price by which to∣gether with the assessments  to pay the troops  and va∣rious other tallage rateable at the  King's pleasure  the common people were reduced to extreme penury and want of every comfort in life And with respect to persons of highter rank if any Nobleman or Gentle∣man was accused of a crime even by his enemies he was liable to be dragged to a  private examination  by the intermediation of messengers in the King's cham∣ber or elsewhere in a private place without seeing his accusers himself alone being seen and when the King or perhaps his Minister has  been pleased  to judge him guilty the poor  passive Subject  is popped into a sack and in the night time cast into the river by the Marshal's servants Howsoever incredible such abominable injustice may appear to Englishmen yet the worthy Chancellor who wrote this account for the instruction of Edward Prince of Wales the son of King Henry VI when in France appeals to the young Prince's  own knowledge  of the notoriety of such facts "You have heard" says he  that more men by much have died in this manner than by the ordinary course of justice yet nevertheless  says he ironically  whatsoever hath pleased the King according to the Civil Law has the force of Law  And while you have been in France and in the neighbourhood of that Kingdom  continues the  Chancellor to the young Prince  you have heard of other  enormities  like to these and some even worse than these  detestably  and  damnably perpetrated  no otherwise than under the colour or pretence of  that Law viz  Quod Principi placuit juxta Leges Civiles legis habet vigorem  Etiam et alia  enor∣mia  says he  hiis similia acquaedam  hiis deteriora  dum in Francia et prope regnum illud conversatus es audisti non alio quam  legis illius colore  DETESTABILI∣TUR DAMNABILITER QUE PERPETRATA quae hic inserere nostrum nimium dialogum protelaret  c  Whether or not  this particular mode  of dispatching the French King's Subjects is yet in use I know not but of this we are well assured that  private executions of persons un∣known  are still practised there which in effect are  equal∣ly dangerous  and cannot be considered in any other light than that of so many  wilful Murders  for which the Kings of France and all those men whom they have intrusted with the administration of Justice are most certainly accountable and must one day answer in their own private persons  as individuals  besides the enormous guilt which lies heavy upon that whole people as a  nation  for  passively  permitting such noto∣rious and crying  iniquity  to be practised among them under the borrowed  name  of  Law  And it is not only  the dispatching of men  to put them out of the way of opposition to Government that is intended by these  midnight executions  but also in some cases to satisfy a base malicious revenge by torturing the helpless vic∣tim with the cruel death of  breaking on the wheel  for as both the  name  and  crime  of the  sufferer is con∣cealed  or perhaps a wrong name given out to pre∣vent pity it cannot be said that such cruelty is used by way  of example  to deter bad men from commit∣ing treason or other particular crimes so that  such  private executions  can be attributed to nothing but a DIABOLICAL DEPRAVITY in the minds of those who order them  It also appears that one use of a  standing Army  in that unhappy Kingdom is to guard the avenues of streets to prevent the people from discovering the  actors  as well as  sufferers  at such horrid  masked tragedies  as I have mentioned and therefore I cannot help remarking the extreme absurdity of that otherwise sensible and shrewd people in boasting of their  national military Ho∣nour  when even large bodies of their bestdisciplined troops who are  Frenchmen  also by birth and have the means in their own hands to render justice and restore liberty to their  muchinjured countrymen  can yet tamely yield themselves so far to the  absolute Will  of any man or men on earth as to become  silent accomplices  like the detestable Turkish  Mutes  of old to the horrid crime of  wilful Murder  for such are the  secret execu∣tions  of France and professed  Tools  for perpetrating the most abandoned wickedness To such a disgrace∣ful and  slavish  pitch of  passive obedience  is that oncespirited nation now reduced that they seem to give up all pretensions to that  fundamental Right of human Na∣ture  which alone distinguishes  men  from  brutes  I mean the indispensible  Right of judging for themselves  and of yielding obedience to the impulse of  Conscience  accord∣ing to that natural knowledge of  good and evil  which is implanted in  all men French soldiers  as well as others and of which they must one day render a strict account in a separate  disbanded  state as  individuals  which I have before remarked  stript of their arms and regimentals  Shall we then adopt the  Laws of France  quod principi placuit  c  It is not impossible that such a measure may sometime or other be proposed by an inconsiderate Minister and that a Parliament through  the  unequal Representation of the  People the  want of frequent elections  and other defects in the constitution  c  may hereafter be led to yield their consent to it but even if ever that should be the case I shall still entertain hopes from the general disposition of our  Bri∣tish  Troops notwithstanding the alarming effects of  standing Armies  in all other Nations that they will ne∣ver become so detestably base and degenerate as to per∣mit their country to groan under any such iniquitous Oppressions as are practised in  France  Nevertheless should  they also  become such  slavish Tools of Despotism  as to assist in enforcing any such unconstitutional mea∣sures let them know for a certainty that as soon as the  national spirit of Freedom  of which they at present participate is by their means unhappily suppressed even they themselves must necessarily degenerate with their countrymen and will be no more able to stand before their enemies than the other wretched troops whom they have so often driven before them  I do not find in∣deed  that he has literally cited the cor∣rupt maxims but he has manifestly laid  down the same principle though in dif∣ferent words towards the beginning of  the same chapter where he is defining the difference between  Law  and some  other things which seem to bear relation to it as  Counsel  which requires  reasons  to produce an  obligation  c  "But  Law  " says he  though it ought not to want its  reasons  yet these  reasons  are not the cause why obe∣dience is paid to it  but the power of the Exactor  who when he has sig∣nified his  pleasure  lays an  obligation  on the  Subjects  to act in conformity to his decree though perhaps they do not so well apprehend the  reasons  of the injunction  c  and after citing a similar passage from Mr Hobbs he adds  For no man can say  sic volo sic ju∣beo  so I will and so I command unless  Stet pro  Ratione voluntas  His  Will  is his  Reason  "We obey Laws therefore" says he  not principally upon account of the matter of them but upon account of  the Legislator's Will  Book chap §    Thus the learned Civilian seems to consider  the Will and Pleasure  of a Sove∣reign as the life and spirit of Laws which  notion  is highly  unreasonable  in every case but one  viz  when we are speaking of the Laws of that Sovereign alone whose  Will  is the fountain of  Reason  and whose  Pleasure  by our own natural  Reason  we are convinced is infinite  goodness justice  and  mercy  to∣wards all those to whom he has signified his commands because we cannot separate the  idea  of infallible  Reason Wisdom  and eternal  Justice  from any command of divine authority  And yet this application of the Baron's doctrine even to the  supreme  Law is not conformable throughout to what I  understand in this place of the Baron's idea of  Law  for he assigns no other  cause why obedience is paid to it but the  power  of  the Exactor  whereas God's Laws have many other apparent  causes  of  obligation  of which I have alteady mentioned the due sense we  na∣turally  entertain of the infinite  Wisdom  and  Truth  as well as  the Power  of the Divine Author who is so far from being  an Exactor  of  Laws  that the revelation of his will for the good government of mankind has generally been addressed to the  Senses  and  Reason  of Men that their  Covenant  with God might be founded on  free Consent  the highest and most obli∣gatory  Cause of Obedience  Now as the Laws of God are thus tendered to us under the equitable form of a  reciprocal Covenant  thereby bind∣ing even himself the supreme Lord and Creator of all things to us his poor mortal subjects under  conditional Promises  which cannot fail on his part how much more ought all mere  worldly  Governors to be restrained and limi∣ted by equitable  Covenants  of  mutual obligation  between them and their Sub∣jects since their  equality  in nature gives  the latter an undoubted Right to insist on this the only safe mode of worldly Government  The consideration of this point leads me to one of the principal Grounds of Baron Puffendorf's Mistake beforemen∣tioned  He does not seem to have been aware that in all societies of men governed by  Laws  some sort of  general Covenant  must be understood to subsist between the several  Sovereigns  and their  Subjects  re∣spectively and though such  Covenants  are not always  expressed  yet most cer∣tainly they are always  implied  because we must necessarily presume that  the Good of the People  is the original intention and principal end of all  legal  human Go∣vernments since  all Men are naturally equals  and  a Man  who submits himself to the Sovereignty or Government of another that he may enjoy the benefit and protection of society does not on that account cease to be  a Man  nei∣ther can the temporal Sovereign himself be released from the  natural  Tyes of  that Relation  for whenever he forgets that he himself is  a Man  of the same falli∣ble understanding and natural infirmities  with his Subjects who are his  equals  both on their  entrance  and at their  exeunt  from the Stage of Life he immediately loses the best Rule for his Conduct as  a Prince  and necessarily degenerates into  brutality  so that in such cases to sup∣pose that THE WILL  of the Prince  is to be allowed  the force of Law  is the high∣est absurdity Nay even the Baron himself has elsewhere declared that  the word MAN is thought to carry somewhat of  Dignity  in its sound and we commonly  says he  make use of this as the last and the most prevail∣ing argument against a rude insulter  I am not a Beast a Dog but I am  A MAN  as well as yourself  Since then  human  nature agrees  equally  to all per∣sons and since no one can live a socia∣ble life with another who does not own and respect him as  a Man  it fol∣lows as a command of the Law of Nature  that  EVERY MAN  esteem and treat  ANOTHER as one who is natural∣ly HIS EQUAL or who is A MAN as well as he  Book c p It would therefore be unreasonable to conceive that any society of MEN should voluntarily submit themselves to a tempo∣ral  Sovereign without supposing at the same time some  reciprocal obligation  or  duty  to subsist between them which is no∣thing else but the  implication  of a mutual  Covenant  and indeed the formalities of every Coronation sufficiently indicate and warrant such an  implication  and the in∣fringements made by Monarchs on such  implied Covenants  have in all ages been occasionally punished by the expulsion and destruction of the Tyrants them∣selves of which most nations have at some time or other afforded an example  Nevertheless the learned Baron seems to have neglected these necessary conside∣rations for he asserts that the dis∣tinction between a  Compact  or  Covenant  and a  Law  is obvious  For a  Com∣pact  says he  is a  Promise  but a  Law  is a  Command  In Compacts the form of speaking is  I will  do so and so but in Law the form runs  do thou so  after an imperative manner  Book c § p  He had before been speaking of demo∣cratical Governments and had remarked not only that the ancients  frequently apply to Laws the name of  common Agreements  but also that "the Laws"  among the Grecians  were made upon the proposal of the Magistrate with the Knowledge and  by the Command of the People  and so  as it were "in the way of  bargain or stipulation  " says he  they gave them the name of  Covenants  and  Agreements  beforemen∣tioned  and yet he will not allow notwithstanding such authority that they are properly stiled  "Covenants"  having puzzled himself with the diffe∣rence between a national  Covenant  and a  Covenant  of individuals  for in this last case  says he  a person that  dissents is not bound  and the party cannot pro∣ceed without him whereas in the for∣mer  case  even the  dissenting Party  is tied and obliged by the plurality of votes  Now the learned Baron has not been aware that this very reason which he himself has assigned confirms the propriety of that ancient custom which he condemns  viz  the applying the name of  Covenants  and  Agreements  to  Laws  for he allows that  the  dissent∣ing Party  is tied and obliged by  the plu∣rality of votes  and therefore even a whole nation in that case may be said to act as  an individual  because  that to  which the greater number give consent  as he himself remarks in the preceding paragraph  is taken  for the  Will and De∣cree of all  so that by this means a  whole Nation  is as capable of making a  Covenant  or  Compact  as an  Individual  and I will only add to what the Baron has allowed about the  binding  of  those who dissent  that they are bound  only so far  as the imposed  Obligation  is consistent with their  superior Covenant  and duty to God which is always to be  implied  for even the SOVEREIGN of  the World  THE KING OF KINGS who alone can be said to have an  absolute Right  to govern his creature man  without a free Covenant  if he had been pleased so to do has nevertheless condescended to include all his positive  Laws  in two express  legal Covenants  the  old  and the  new  both of which have been from time to time confirmed and fulfilled and still respectively subsist to this day in all points wherein the former is not superseded and fulfilled by the latter It therefore ill becomes this learned Civilian to separate the idea of a  Compact  or  Covenant from Law  and more especially when he endeavours thereby to establish  the Power of the  Exactor  the capricious  Will  of mere temporal fallible Sovereigns which he supposes to be  Law  independent of all  Compacts  or  Covenants  expressed or im∣plied  Thus I hope I have traced to the very foundation the Baron's error in denying the principle or maxim beforementioned concerning the necessity of popular  as∣sent  in Legislation for if he had not attempted to separate the idea of a  Coven∣nant  from  Law  he could not have over∣looked the absolute  illegality  of those pretended Laws which are ordained only by the  Will  and  Power of the Exac∣tor  because the meanest professor of the English common Law would have told him that every submission  promise  or  agreement  that is  extorted  by  fear  and  compulsion  is according to the  Law of Nature  totally  null and void in itself  and he himself is sufficiently sensible of this in another place  Those  promises  then or  pacts  we take to be  invalid  which a man is  compelled  to engage in by the  unjust force  of the party to whom they are made for since he who  extorts  any thing from another by using unjust terrours is  by the Law of Nature  bound to restore it and must consequently make good what the other person loses by such forced bargain the necessity of  Reparation  in the party who offered the violence  takes off  ALL OBLIGATION  to payment in the party who suffered it  c  Book c § p  And even if  an oath should be obtained to confirm the unjust  "Power of the Exactor"  it will not increase his Right for the Ba∣ron's own doctrine again in another part of his book affords a sufficient an∣swer to annul every pretence of  Obliga∣tion  on account of  oaths extorted by un∣just Fear  But what are we to think of  oaths  extorted by  unjust Fear  Surely the Person who by means of this  Fear  procured a promise  upon oath  is no less obliged to  release the promise  thus violently obtained than  if no oath had been  added to confirm it There∣fore there appears no reason why  Compensation  should not be admitted in this case in opposition to  the Claim  of the  injurious Party  according to the rules laid down by us  says he  when we treated of the general subject of  Fear  Book c § p    Thus the maxim concerning  the neces∣sity of Assent  for which I contend is sufficiently proved to be a  Law of Na∣ture  even by the learned Baron's own arguments and I desire no better  In consequence of the Baron's gene∣ral misconception  I have spent the more time in warning my Rea∣ders against the Errors of this celebrated Civilian be∣cause the studying of his Works I am informed is at this time considered as a material part of Education in our Universities so that  the rising Generation  of the very best Families in this Kingdom are liable to im∣bibe as it were with the Milk of Instruction these poisonous Doctrines which thereby become fixed and engrafted in their tender minds as a  foundation  for their  future political Principles  Thus a most dangerous source of unconstitution∣al notions has been opened and seems already to have flowed throughout the Kingdom so that we need not wonder at the  modern partiality  for in∣creasing the number as well as the powers of  Courts of Admiralty  and other seminaries of the  Civil Law  though the very existence of  British Liberty  depends on duly restraining and limiting the  Civil Law Courts  within those bounds of jurisdiction which have been allowed them by the ancient Constitution of this Kingdom And therefore I hope my Readers will ex∣cuse my having exceeded the usual form of publications in making  so long  a Preface to  so short  a Work since it was absolutely necessary to guard against these dange∣rous and inveterate errors of the  Civil Law  before I could safely proceed to my Declaration in favour of  po∣pular Assent  concerning the ne∣cessity  of  agreement  to make Laws valid he has asserted also  that neither the  divine positive Laws  nor the  Laws of Nature  had their rise from the  agree∣ment of men  c  Book c § p  Now his observation is certainly  true  as far as it relates to the  rise  or  origin  of such Laws for the Laws being  divine  must necessarily have  "had their rise"  from God but yet this does not set aside  "the agreement of men"  by which they have been ratified and confirmed in all ages The Baron seems to have overlooked the information we have received from Scrip∣ture that men inherit a  divine attribute  from their parents I mean that  knowledge of good and evil  which they took upon themselves contrary to the  express com∣mand of God  and thereby unhappily en∣tailed Sin and Death on all their posteri∣ty for that  divine knowledge  necessarily engages and includes our  agreement  or  as∣sent  to the  "the Laws of Nature"  whe∣ther we obey them or not and thereby renders us  answerable  for our imperfect conduct in this world and consequently  guilty before God  And from hence arises the necessity of a redemption to re∣lieve mankind from that unhappy effect of the  Original Sin  for as  the strength of Sin is the Law  The sting of Death is Sin and the  strength of Sin is the Law  Cor xv  so the guilt of every criminal action is  with justice imputed  to us because we have  wilfully  offended against this  natural light  or  Law in our Hearts  by which we ought to have known how  to refuse the  EVIL  and choose the  GOOD  This knowledge of  Good and Evil  was discovered even by the Gentiles  to be a divine attribute  Cicero calls this natural knowledge of Good and Evil  Law  "Lex" says he in his first Book De Legibus  est  ratio summa  insita  in natura  quae  ju∣het  ea quae facienda sunt  prohibetque  contraria  eadem catio  cum est in hominis mente confirmata et confec∣ta  Lex  est  And in his third Book De Officiis where he is speaking again of natural Reason he calls it  a Divine Law    I psa naturae ratio quae est  Lex di∣vina  et Humana  And elsewhere he more parti∣cularly declares it to be a  Divine Attribute    Recta  numine Deorum  tracta  ratio  And he mentions this  attribute  again in his second Book  De Natura Deo∣rum  where he speaks of  prudence  or  the  choice of Good  and  rejection of Evil  as a universal Law  common to God and man  Sequitur ut  eadem  sit in  his  Diis quae in  genere humano ratio eadem veritas  utrobique sit  eademque Lex  quae est  recti praeceptio pravique depulsio  Ex quo intelligitur  prudentiam  quoque et  mentem a Diis  ad homines pervenisse  c  though they were unacquainted probably with the occasion of its being engrafted in human nature It must therefore appear that the  agree∣ment  or  assent  of mankind to the moral and eternal Laws of God which the Ba∣ron and other Civilians commonly call "the  Laws of Nature  " may very fairly be presumed and admitted as a natural effect of the human understanding when∣ever any of the said Laws are mentioned for all persons who have any reflection  must be sensible that we stand selfcon∣demned by  Conscience  which is only an∣other name for  the knowledge of Good and Evil  whenever we offend a∣gainst  the moral Laws  of God by which our  Agreement  and  Assent  to the justice of them are sufficiently  implied  and ac∣knowledged  I have traced this subject more at large in a separate Tract on "the  Law of Nature and Principles of Action in  MAN" intended also for the Press  And with respect to what the Baron has likewise insinuated concerning the want of  human agreement  to the  "divine positive Laws"  the di∣rect contrary thereto is clearly demon∣strated as I have before hinted by the remarkable examples of two incontesti∣ble legal  Covenants  between  God and Man  the Old and New Testaments those two original written  Charters or Grants  of PERFECT LIBERTY the one containing the  Promises  and the other the  Accomplish∣ment  of our  glorious Freedom  which we are bound to maintain and defend to the last moment of our lives  The mention that has already been made of these two unquestionable monu∣ments of the  free State and Condition  to which the Almighty has been pleased to  invite his creature Man might perhaps be sufficient for my present purpose without descending to farther particulars but yet as I received extraordinary satis∣faction myself in tracing minutely the manner in which the said Covenants have been tendered and ratified I am in∣clined to suppose that many of my Rea∣ders will reap the same satisfaction by perusing some examples of it because they demonstrate the  real dignity  and  natural Rights  of MAN far beyond any thing that I could possibly have conceived before I made the said Examination with this particular view to the  Freedom  of Man and as I have too much reason to apprehend that many of my country∣men have overlooked or neglected these  striking Instances  which relate to the pre∣sent subject the  Right of Assent  I propose to add sometime hereafter as soon as I can possibly find leisure to revise it for the press a  third Part  also to this  Declaration of the People's natural Right to a Share in the Legislature  which d  Part  be∣ing founded on some remarkable examples in Scripture concerning the gracious and most liberal mode whereby the  revealed Laws even of God himself  have been  tendered from time to time to the con∣sideration and acceptance of mankind proves by comparative demonstration that the MAXIMS OF THE FOREIGN CIVI∣LIANS whereby they set up the mere WILL of fallible earthly Princes as LAW viz  Quod Principi placuit habet vigorem LegisStet pro ratione voluntas c  substituting WILL for REASON are IMPIOUS AND UNJUST since even the ALMIGHTY SOVEREIGN OF THE UNIVERSE to whose WILL a∣lone such deference is  justly due  hath not so dealt with his creature Man enforcing his  Will  for his  Reason  but on the con∣trary hath mercifully condescended to convince us his frail mortal subjects that REASON is his WILL and that he hath  limited  if I may be allowed such an expression even his own  infinite Power  by the eternal rules of Justice and Righteousness which our own  natural Reason  teaches us can never fail and therefore as true  Freedom  consists in the  certainty  of known Laws so the most  perfect Liberty  must necessarily subsist under the Government of the  Almighty  who has appealed by his prophets from time to time in the most affecting man∣ner  to the  reason  and  senses  of mankind that his Laws might be confirmed by a  voluntary popular Assent  the only true foundation of all valid  Compacts  and that the said Laws have accordingly been solemnly  ratified  and voluntarily accept∣ed by the people in two  mutual Com∣pacts  or  Covenants  commonly called the Old and New Testaments whereby not only the People are bound  on their part  but even the ETERNAL KING HIMSELF is  conditionally  bound also  on his part  to the performance of the  most glorious Promises  The promises of God are made to all mankind without exception who receive and keep his  Covenant  so that every true believer be his rank in life ever so mean is undoubtedly capable of becoming  an a∣dopted Son  of God  "That we might receive  the adoption of sons  " said the Apostle to the Galatians  and because  ye are sons  God hath sent forth the Spirit of  his Son  into your hearts crying  Abba Father  Gal iv    "A temple of God" by the

 Rights of his highlyfavoured creature Man How then can any particular Man or body of Men presume to set up their own WILL for LAW and thereby deprive their  Brethren  of that  Right  which of all others is most essential to  Reasonable  beings I mean the  Right  of  Assent  Let those men who thus inconside∣rately venture to affront the  dignity of mankind▪  by with∣holding from them their

time at  his holy Table  from which the Subjects of his Kingdom cannot safely abstain with∣out seeming to deny that  allegiance  and  homage  which they indispensibly owe to their eternal Sovereign  I had intended also to have added to this Declaration a little Tract on  the Law Eternal  which limits Legisla∣ture and forms the Basis of the Subjects Rights  but the same Reason which obliged me to postpone the  Third part  of the Declaration already mentioned o∣bliged me to defer this also for the pre∣sent Nevertheless as my Declaration is founded on many of the  principles  and  maxims  of that same "  eternal Law  " I shall beg leave to add to this Preface a short quotation from the said Tract con∣cerning the weight use and manner of applying the  maxims  or rules of  eternal Reason  which is the more necessary at this time because I find there are great numbers of people who are so ill in∣formed of these matters as to talk of  the  omnipotence  of  Parliament  as if they conceived that every thing whatsoever that is ordained by Parliament must be  Law  whether it be  good  or  evil  right or wrongA most pernicious and bane∣ful Doctrine this A kind of  Popery in Politics  if I may use such an expres∣sion which is dangerous to the  eternal  as well as  temporal  happiness of man∣kind  The welfare and happiness of So∣ciety indeed require that every indivi∣dual from the highest to the lowest should have some  general idea of Law  but more particularly is this requifite in  England  where the  People  enjoy as the most valuable Heritage derived from their ancestors the natural and most equitable  Right  of forming a part of the  legislative Power  Law  is indeed a very comprehensive Term which includes such a prodi∣gious fund of abstruse learning that a  particular and accurate knowledge of it  is scarcely to be acquired with the ut∣most assiduity and labour even of a man's whole life and yet a  general  idea of  Law  I mean that which is  immutable  and  eternal  and which forms the  ground  and  basis  of all other  Laws  may nevertheless be very easily  in∣culcated  and as easily  retained  because the great outlines or rather  the Ele∣ments and first Principles of the  LAW consist of  the most obvious and selfevident conclusions  of REASON which are  implanted in our very  NATURE since we inherit from our first Parents the  Knowledge of Good and Evil  Good and Evil  are not matters of Law or of Logic They are the most if not the only essential circumstances of the world They are what every thing else refers to They stamp an eternal mark and difference on all things which even imagina∣tion cannot cancel or erase The enjoyment of the  one  and the avoiding of the  other  is the very end of our being and likewise of all the beings which do or which even can be supposed to exist and which have a sense and perception of them Whatever therefore relates  to the general  GOOD  and  EVIL  of a People  is of a  public nature  It is that circumstance which makes it so The terms are as good as synonimous Whatever concerns on the contrary only this or that indi∣vidual is of a private nature It is confined to his or their  happiness  or  welfare  to his or their  good  and  evil  There is again the true and unerring criterion These things seem clear to the greatest de∣gree of intuitive certainty It is strange to be forced to reason about them  Considerations on the Measures carrying on with respect to the British Co∣lonies in North America d Edit p  The "Considerations" indeed of this sensible Au∣thor in every other part of his work highly merit the most serious attention of all those persons of what party soever who desire real information and good council concerning the present disputes with our Brethren in  America    beforementioned  by which every Man who is not an ideot or madman that is  every Man of  COMMON SENSE is  naturally  enabled to receive discern and approve  the first Elements  or leading principles of LAW and REA∣SON when fairly proposed to him in  his own language and these same  Elements  and their  supreme  incontrover∣tible authority being once known and acknowledged it is very easy in gene∣ral for any Man of  Common Sense  to discern by comparison what is contrary and repugnant thereto for THE LAW is compared to a RULE or RIGHT LINE  "Lex est Linea Recti"  by which every thing that is  oblique crooked transverse  or different from that RIGHT LINE is easily known to the meanest capacity and therefore  in the Law  the RIGHT LINE  is always to be  PREFERRED  Linea recta semper praefertur transversali  Co Lib b  And from hence it arises that the adjectives OBLIQUE CROOKED TRANSVERSE  c  which have no im∣moral signification when applied to material shapes and figures are never∣theless ODIOUS IN LAW which is well observed by the great Sir Ed∣ward Coke  "Rectum"  says he  is a proper and significant word for the RIGHT that any hath and WRONG or INJURY is in French aptly called TORT because INJURY and WRONG is WRESTED or CROOK∣ED  bring contrary to that which is  Right and Straight  c    See in the margin below the remainder of this Remark  "Now the LAW that is" says Sir Ed∣ward Coke  LINEA RECTA  est Index sui et obliqui  And  Briton  saith that TORT A LA LEY EST CON∣TRARIE and as aptly for the cause aforesaid is IN∣JURY in English called WRONG And INJU∣RIA is derived from  in  and  jus  because it is con∣trary to RIGHT so as  a faire tort  is  facere  um  and  Fleta  saith  est autem  JUS PUBLICUM  et  PRI∣VATUM  quod ex naturalibus praeceptis aut Ge  iiu  a a  t civilibus  st collectum et quod injure scripto  JUS  appellatur id in lege  Augliae RECTUM  esse cicitur  And in the  Mirror  and other places of the Law it is called DROIT as DROIT DEFEND  the Law de∣fendeth  Inst lib c p The last two words however ought rather to have been ren∣dered  the Law forbiddeth  than  "the Law defendeth"  because the English verb  defend  is very seldom used in the Sense which Sir Edward Coke meant to express    But when great Nations become too subservient to  one  or  a few individuals  either by the corruption or total exclu∣sion of  popular Representation  in their re∣spective Legislatures they generally seem to lose all sense of  Right and Wrong  all  common Honesty  in their political measures as if they thought the command of an earthly superior would be a sufficient warrant for them to set aside THE ETER∣NAL LAW and so perpetrate the most abominable actions with impunity How shall we account for such wretched  time serving  in men who are endued with the  natural light  of  Reason  and  Common Sense  Perhaps it may be of∣ten attributed to  the fear  of  temporal Sufferings  and inconveniences which supercede that  Reason  and  Conscience  which should always controul the ac∣tions of  Men  and distinguish them from  Brutes  For without these they deserve not the name of  men  since a more evident  "mark of the Beast"  need not be sought for than the neglect of  reason  and  con∣science  or the baseness of yielding the same in an  active obedience  to the arbitrary  will  of any  man  or body of  men  whatsoever  They forget that whilst they yield an implicit  active  obedience to the  unlawful  commands of any  tem∣poral Monarch  or  Legislature  through the fear of present inconveniences or  corporal Sufferings  they rebel against the King eternal who has power over their  souls  as well as their  bodies  "I say unto you" said our Lord  my friends be not afraid of them that kill tho body and after that have no more that they can do but I will forewa  n you whom you shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into Hell yea I say unto you fear him  Luke xii See also Matthew x  It was on this Principle alone this sense of  superior Duty  arising from the fear of God that I founded my Address to the  Gentlemen of the Army  in my  little Tract on "Crown Law respect∣ing the due distincton between  Murder  and  Manslaughter  but as my senti∣ments on that head have since been cen∣sured I hope it will not be thought too foreign to my present topic if I insist that no act of injustice can be more fla∣grant than that of denying to any parti∣cular order of Men whether  Soldiers  or others their  natural Right  of appealing to the  eternal Law  and of acting agree∣able to the dictates of their own  Reason  and  Conscience  In my former Tract I remarked that  the Law will not excuse an  unlawful Act committed by a  SOLDIER even though he commits it by  the express Command  of the highest  military Autho∣rity  in the Kingdom  c  and that  "Men of true Honour"  who have also  a true Sense of Religion  will not only be mindful that they are  Soldiers  and  Subjects  to an earthly KING but that they are also  Soldiers  and  Subjects  to the KING of KINGS whose Laws and Precepts they will on all occasions prefer to  every other command  c  But this has been denied it seems by a Critic in the Monthly Review for Janu∣ary who calls it  a strange Prin∣ciple  In an Age of infidelity indeed  it may perhaps be allowed in one Sense to be a  strange Principle  but then we have the greatest Reason to lament the ignorance and depravity of those Men who esteem it so in any other sense than than of being  too often  neglected and trans∣gressed for I trust that no Man who admits or believes the divine authority of the holy Scriptures will doubt  the Truth of it  If this  strange  PRINCIPLE had not been  equally true  the English Nation as I re∣marked in my former Tract would long ago have been  enslaved  and I will now add that even the very  standing Army  itself would by this time have been reduced to that  abject State  of  political Slavery  which at present disgraces the  standing Army  of  France  I am a professed enemy indeed to  standing Armies  but God forbid that I should be so to the  in∣dividuals  incorporated therein whose  true honour na∣tural dignity  and  just privileges  AS MEN I shall over be ready to assert and vindicate and indeed I am bound to do so by that indispensible duty which I owe to the great Author of  human Nature  in opposi∣tion to the spiritual prince of this world who is ever plotting to  corrupt vilify  and  enslave  that noblest work of God  Mankind  And as this same  Love  and  Reward  which I here profess for the INDIVIDUALS  of the Army  are certainly due also to the INDIVIDUALS  of every other Body of Men  whose  general Principles  are cen∣sured in this Declaration I must beg leave to assure my Readers that I do not mean to oppose the  Men  but merely their  unreasonable Principles  without any  personal  application whatsoever for otherwise the se∣verity of my expressions especially against the  Church of Rome  and the  French Government  would be entire∣ly inconsistent with that  "GoodWill to Men"  which I am indispensibly obliged  Upon this point I have wrote a distinct Tract which is intended also for publication and entitled "a Tract on the  Law of Liberty  "  for my own eternal Happiness to maintain  and there∣fore  those Writers who attempt by any fallacious sophistry to withdraw our  Bri∣tish Soldiers  See Note in page x of this  Preface  from their obedience to the  eternal Law  or from that allegiance which they indispensibly owe to the empire of  Reason  and  Conscience  may justly be said to trial them more like  Brutes  than  Men  But as all men of  Common Sense  are enabled by that  hereditary Knowledge  beforementioned which has been  com∣mon  to all ranks of people ever since the fall of Man to distinguish  Good from Evil  This point is more particularly examined and proved in my Tract concerning  the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in  MAN  so they are  equally enabled  and indeed  entitled  thereby to  judge  "Do ye not know that the Saints"  which Term  is not confined to  Persons of any particular  Rank  or  Office    shall JUDGE THE WORLD And if  the World shall be judged by you  are ye  unworthy to judge the smallest Matters  Know ye not that  we shall  JUDGE  Angels  HOW MUCH MORE THINGS THAT PERTAIN TO THIS LIFE  Cor vi  concerning  the Legality of  all human Ordinances  that is to dis∣cern and distinguish  Right  from  Wrong Equity  from  Iniquity Droit  from  Tort Jus  from its opposite  Injuria c  This universal faculty of discern∣ment perhaps will be better known and more readily acknowledged under the title of  Conscience  for by that natural instinct of Conscience every individual  knows when he does amiss  and is there∣by rendered responsible before God and Man for all his actions  And as all natural Faculties may be improved by the rudiments of Art and Science so even the NATURAL FEELINGS OF CONSCIENCE may be rendered more  sensible tender  and  distinguishing  by a proper Knowledge of  the Elements  or leading Precepts of the LAW ETERNAL  The remainder of the Tract consists in a recital and application of such general  Max∣ims  as must be allowed by all persons of  Common Sense  to be THE NECESSARY CON∣CLUSIONS OF REASON and are therefore to be esteemed LAWS OF NATURE such as  no Power on Earth can have any authority to counter act  and the said  ge∣neral Maxims  or Rules of  Reason  and  natural Law  are accordingly by our Law writers with great propriety esteemed the  first Foundation of the English  Law  Primum Fundamentum Legis Angliae est LEX RATIONIS  c  Quae  in hoc Regno  sicut in omni∣bus aliis Regnis ubique tenentur  Doct et Stud c p  There is indeed an  inferior  order of  Maxims  though yet of very great authority which arise from general customs and the approved ancient determina∣tions of the Courts of Law and these form what is called THE FOURTH  foundation  of the  English Law  though they may be ranked as the Author of Doctor and Student informs us with the  general ancient customs  ON THE THIRD  foundation    Si quis tamen pro uno solo fundamento ea  meaning  the general customs  and the several  maxims  arising therefrom  censeri judicaverit ad placitum suum ea  pro uno tantum fun∣damento  compotare potest et tune secundum illum  quinque fundamenta  for otherwise he reckons  six  in in all  Legis Angliae tantum  assignari debent  Doct et Stud c p  But as the true meaning of the said  inferior Maxims  is not  obvious  to people in general like those belonging to the  first foundation  it is happy for us that they are  not necessary  to be known by any persons who do not profess the Law neither indeed can they be known without great study and labour of which we are well apprised by the learned Author of Doctor and Student  Haec vero  maxima  solum in Curiis Regiis five inter Legis Angliae peritos nos∣cuntur nec leviter absque  magno studio  in legibus Angliae habendo cogno  ci possunt Ideo pro sepa∣rabilibus fundamentis ponuntur  Ibid  It is on these incontrover∣tible and plain MAXIMS these  necessary Conclusions  of REASON that the follow∣ing Declaration is founded and there∣fore as we are warned also by the re∣vealed Laws of God  not to do  evil  that  good  may come  The Apostle Paul has delivered a  most tremen∣dous warning  to those wretched Politicians who  the baneful Doctrine  Let us do  EVIL  that  GOOD  may come  for he immediately adds  WHOSE DAMNATION  says he  IS JUST  Rom iii  If those persons who contend for the ABSO∣LUTE NECESSITY  of Bribery Pensions and other  UN∣DUE  means of parliamentary Influence for the carrying on public Business  would carefully consider the said  warn∣ing  they would have just reason to be  alarmed  on ac∣count of their own  personal  danger for having pro∣moted such a baneful and destructive principle    every rea∣sonable  Man must necessarily admit that  Good  and  Evil Right  and  Wrong Justice  and  Iniquity  can never change their real properties through the sup∣posed NECESSITY of any political Mea∣sures whatsoever and that nothing but  Justice  and  Righteousness  can ever  es∣tablish the Throne  Take away the Wicked from before the King and his  Throne  shall be  established  in Righte∣ousness  Prov xxv  It is only against some particular  Opinions  and  evil Council  and not against the  Persons  of those who may have promoted the same that I mean to apply this excellent proverb The real intentions of such Men though  erroneous  may have been  as sincere  as my own and I therefore protest that my earnest wish is to promote a  change  of  opinions  and  measures  rather than of  persons  since those who are once convinced of their  former mistakes  may here∣after prove more useful Servants to the public than others perhaps whose  abilities  and  conduct  are yet untried  of our most gra∣cious Sovereign for whose Peace and real Happiness both  temporal  and  eter∣nal  there is not a more sincere wellwisher amongst all his Subjects not∣withstanding the freedom of the followDeclaration than  GRANVILLE SHARP  A DECLARATION OF THE People's Natural Right to a Share in the Legislature  c  AN accurate and critical knowledge of Law such as can only be acquired by much reading and long experience in the profession is indeed a necessary qua∣lification for those persons who under∣take to deliver their opinions concerning the nicer and more difficult questions of jurisprudence but when the  Natural Rights  of any of our fellowsubjects are apparently at stake every man has a right to judge for himself and to de∣clare his sentiments as far as  plain con∣clusions of reason  and  commonsense  will  fairly warrant and such only are re∣ferred to in the following Declaration of the  Natural Right  of popular Repre∣sentation in the legislature  Amongst all the rights and privileges appertaining unto us  said that truly noble lawyer Lord Sommers  Judgement of whole Kingdoms  c  p    that of having a Share in the Legislation and being to be governed by such laws as we ourselves shall chuse is the most fundamental and  essential  as well as the most  advantageous  and beneficial  c  And as all British subjects whether in GreatBritain Ireland or the Colo∣nies are  equally free  by the law of  Na∣ture  they certainly are  equally  entitled to the same  Natural  Rights that are  essential  for their own preservation because this privilege of  having a share in the legis∣lation  is not merely a  British Right  pe∣culiar  to  this island  but it is also a  Na∣tural Right  which cannot without the most flagrant and stimulating injustice be withdrawn from any part of the British Empire  by any worldly authority whatso∣ever  because  by the  natural Law  whereunto he ALMIGHTY GOD hath made all subject  says the learned Hooker  Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity lib § p  the lawful power of making laws to command whole  po∣litic societies of men  belongeth so pro∣perly  unto the same entire societies  that for any Prince or Potentate of  what kind soever  upon earth to exercise the same of himself  or themselves  and not either by express Commission im∣mediately and personally received from God or else by authority derived at the first from  their consent upon whose per∣sons they impose laws  it is no better than mere tyranny Laws they are  not  therefore  which public  Appro∣bation  hath not made so  Agreeable to the same just principles of  natural E∣quity  is that maxim of the English Con∣stitution that  Law to bind all must be assented to by all  Principia Leg∣et Aequit p  and there can be no legal appearance of  Assent  without some de∣gree of  Representation  It must indeed be acknowledged that the Representation of the people of Eng∣land is not so perfect as equity may seem to require since very many individuals have no VOTE in Elections and con∣sequently cannot be said expressly to give  their Assent  to the laws by which they are governed nevertheless the whole country which they inhabit and in which they earn their bread and even the very houses in which they live whe∣ther they are housekeepers or lodgers  are represented  I must beg leave to refer the reader also to some excellent observations on this head in a Pamphlet published since the above was written entitled  An Argument in Defence of the Colonies  p and  by the votes of the respective proprietors since  every Free∣holder  has a  Right  to  vote  so that in this one respect the Representation is general and though  far from  EQUAL would still be a sufficient check against arbitrary power and afford sufficient se∣curity for the lives and property of those persons who  have no Vote  if the laws against parliamentary corruption and es∣pecially that Act of and Wil III c were duly enforced and also if all persons who are entrusted with the disposal of public Money were required to render a strict account of it and to be severely punished whenever convicted of exerting the influence of the  public trea∣sury  against  public liberty  which is the most baneful treachery and dishonesty that men in office who are the servants  of  the Public  as well as of  the King  can possibly commit But notwith∣standing the  Inequality  of the English  Representation  and the various means practised to corrupt it yet it has been the principal instrument of preserving amongst us those remains of  natural Li∣berty  which we still enjoy in a greater proportion than most other kingdoms and has occasioned more examples of just retribution on  Tyrants Traitors  and  CourtFavourites  in the English annals than the history of any other nation af∣fords so that M Rapin is thereby led to conclude his account of K Richard II that notorious corrupter of parliaments and enemy to the privileges of London and other corporations with the fol∣lowing reflection  That in a govern∣ment such as that of England all the efforts that the Sovereign makes to usurp an absolute authority are so many steps which lead him towards  the precipice  C'est que dans un Gouvernement tel que celui d'Angletorre tous les efforts que le Souverain fait pour usurper un pouvoir absolu sont autant de pas qui le conduisent vers le précipice  Tome Liv x p  It is manifest therefore that the constitutional govern∣ment of England even  with all its de∣fects  is infinitely better than any other form of government whereby  the people  are deprived of their just share in the le∣gislature  The celebrated Chancellor Fortescue asserts that a limited or politic Government like that of England is infinitely more eligible for the interest and satis∣faction  even of the Prince himself  than an absolute re∣gal power  Non jugum sed libertas  est politicè regeve populum  securitas  quoque maxima nedum plebi sed ET IPSI REGI alleviatio etiam non mi∣nima solicitudinis suae    Viz  That to rule the people by Government politic is  no Yoke  but  Liberty  and  great security  not only to the subjects but  also to the King himself  and further no small lightening or easement to his charge  De Laud Leg Angl cap p  So that those politicians who plead the necessity of securing at any rate a ma∣jority in parliament to vote implicitly for whatever the Minister proposes do miserably betray the true interest and peace of their Sovereign for this fixes upon the King and his Ministers as in arbitrary go∣vernments the blame and ignominy of every determi∣nation that happens to be wrong which would other∣wise either have been overruled by the free Council of the nation or else must have been equally imputed to the People themselves and yet this wretched policy has alternately been adopted by all parties notwith∣standing that it is founded like many of Machia∣vel's doctrines on that abominable antichristian principle of mere worldlyminded men "Let us do evil that good may come"  whose dam∣nation  says the apostle to the Romans  is just  Rom iii  The  evil  of an undue parliamentary in∣fluence they endeavour to excuse by the plea of  Necessity  for the  Good  of the  State  though it is certainly the most flagrant Violation of the fundamental principles of the  State  and is absolutely destructive of the true in∣terest both of the  Prince  and  People  so that the  Inequality  of  Representation  in this island affords no  just argument for setting aside the  Repre∣sentation  of the people in other parts of the British Empire because experience teaches us that even a  defective Repre∣sentation  is better than none at all and therefore it is highly  unreasonable  and contrary to  natural Equity  to pretend that our brethren and fellowsubjects in the more distant parts of the British Em∣pire  ought to be deprived  entirely  of their  natural Rights  and  Liberties  merely be∣cause our own liberties  are not entirely perfect  or because our own Representa∣tion in the Legislature appears in some few respects to be defective and it would be quite as  unreasonable  to alledge that the principle or reason of the maxim before quoted  viz  that  Law to bind all must be assented to by all  is unjust and inconclusive merely because it would be very difficult to accomplish it  literally  by the express  assent  of every individual But it is clearly sufficient that the maxim be construed to signify that  delegated as∣sent  of the people by a majority of their  legal Representatives  which is  constitu∣tionally  necessary to make  all laws bind∣ing  Nedum principis voluntate  sed et totius regni assensu  ipsa  i e  Angliae statuta conduntur quo populi laesuram illa efficere nequeunt vel non eo∣rum commodum procurare  c    Et si sta∣tuta haec tanta solennitate et prudentia edita ef∣ficaciae tantae quantae conditorum cupiebat inten∣tio non esse contingant concito reformari ipsa possunt et NON SINE COMMUNITATIS ET PRO∣CERUM REGNI ILLIUS ASSENSU quali ipsa pri∣mitus emanarunt  c  Chancel Fortesc de Laud Leg Ang c p b  and such a legal Representa∣tion  of the people is therefore absolutely necessary to constitute an  effectual Legis∣lature  for any part of the  British Em∣pire  for no Tax can be levyed without manifest  Robbery and Injustice  where this  legal and constitutional Representation  is wanting because the English Law ab∣hors the idea of taking the least pro∣perty from  Freemen  without their  free consent  "It  is iniquitous  "  iniquum est  says the maxim  Iniquum est  ingenuis hominibus non esse li∣beram rerum suarum alienationem  Co Lit  And again  Quod nostrum est sine facto five de∣fectu nostro amitti seu in alium transferri non po∣test  Co  Rerum suarum quilibet est moderator et arbiter  Co Lit  Regula∣riter non valet pactum  de re mea  non alienanda  Co Lit  And again  Non potest rex subdi∣tum

aliquod statutum esset editum contra eas  leges divinas  nullius vigoris  in legi∣bus Angliae  censeri debet  c  Doct et Stud c p  In every point of view the making laws for the subjects of any part of the British Empire  without their participa∣tion and assent  is INIQUITOUS and there∣fore  unlawful  for though the purport of any law so made be in itself per∣fectly  just  and  equitable  yet it becomes otherwise  Qui aliquid statuerit  parte inaudita altera  ae∣quum licet dixerit  haud aequum fecerit  Princip Leg et Aequit p  or  "haud aequus fuerit"  Co  that is  unjust  and  ini∣quitous  and therefore  unlawful  by the want of these necessary  legal Formali∣ties  "  Forma legalis  forma  essentialis  "  Co  And  Forma  non observata  infertur adnullatio actus  Co  of  Representation  and  Assent  for if the inhabitants of  one part  of the empire might determine a question or enact a law for the peculiar advantage only of that  one part  though to the ma∣nifest detriment and injury of  another part  without the  Representation  of the latter the former part would be made  judges in their own cause  a circumstance that would be literally  partial  the very reverse of justice and  natural equity  and which must therefore be esteemed  In∣iquity  even to a fundamental maxim  Iniquum est aliquem rei sui esse judi∣cem  "In propria causa nemo judex"  Prin∣cipia Legis et Aequitatis p  viz  It is INIQUITOUS for any one to  be a Judge in his own cause  Par∣tiality  is therefore such an abomination in the eye of the law that no Power on earth can make it LAWFUL for  even  an Act of Parliament  says the learned Judge Hobart Rep  made a∣gainst NATURAL EQUITY as to  make a man judge in his own case  the ex∣ample observe is the very point in ques∣tion "  is  VOID  in itself  " for  jura na∣turae sunt immutabilia  and they are "leges legum"  Every King of England apparently for the  same reason  is restrained by the Law from changing or  making new Laws  without the assent or consent of his WHOLE KINGDOM in  Parliament ex∣pressed  NEQUE Rex ibidem per se aut ministros suos tallagia subsidia aut quaevis onera alia im∣ponit legiis suis aut  leges eorum mutat vel novas con∣dit sine concessione  vel  assensu totius regni sui in parlia∣mento suo expresso c  Chancell Fortescue de Lau∣dibus Legum Angliae c p b  And the  whole King∣dom  even of  GreatBritain  itself is only  a part  of the  British Empire  and there∣fore by a parity of reasoning cannot  justly  or  equitably  be permitted to make laws for  the whole  because  where the same  reason is  the same law or right must prevail  "Ubi eadem ratio ibi idem lex"  or  "jus"  Principia Leg et Aequit p  for  turpis est  pars  quae non convenit cum suo  toto  Plowden  and  nihil in lege  in∣tolerabilius  est eandem rem  diverso jure  censeri  Co  The free Representation of the  people in the legis∣lature  is therefore to be esteemed of all our Rights the  most essential  as Lord Sommers has declared to maintain that excellent Equilibrium of power or mixt government  limited by law  which our  ancestors have always most zealously as∣serted and transmitted to us as our best  Birthright  and  Inheritance  Major haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a jure et legibus quam a parentibus  Inst  so that every attempt  to set the same aside  in any degree or in any  part of the empire  or to  corrupt it  by undue influence of places and pensions or bribes with public mo∣ney is  Treason against the Constitution  the highest of Treason  The  first and highest Treason  is that which is committed  against the Constitution  Lord Sommers's Judgement of whole Kingdoms p    Est autem  injuria  omne quod non  jure  fit  Fleta l c  And on the other hand  they neither are nor can be Traitors who endeavour to preserve and main∣tain the Constitution but they are the Traitors who design and pursue the subversion of it they are the Rebels that go about to overthrow the Go∣vernment of their Country whereas such as seek to support and defend it are the  truly loyal persons  and do act conformable to the ties and obligations of fealty  Lord Sommers p  Agreeable to this doctrine was the answer of Dr Sharp archbishop of York when the question was put to him  How a per∣son who had sworn Allegiance to King James could with a good conscience take the same oath to King William  To which he replied  That the Laws of the land are the only rule of our con∣science in this matter and we are no further bound to pay obedience to governors nor to any other go∣vernors than the Laws enjoin If therefore King William in the eye of the Law be our King we must in conscience pay obedience to him as such I take this  says he  for a certain truth that  as the Law makes the King  so the same  Law  extends or limits or  transfers  our obedience and allegiance and all Oaths imposed by the Law oblige the con∣science no further than the Law meant they should oblige Only this is always to be remembered that whatever Obedience the Laws of the land re∣quire of us it is to be understood with this proviso that it be not contradictory to the Laws of God But in that case we must obey passively though we cannot obey actively and with this tacit condition I do suppose all oaths of fidelity in the world are given and taken  Life of Abp Sharp part d pag and MS wrote by his Son for the

the  legislature  because an Act for so base a purpose would entirely sub∣vert the principles and constitution on which the very Existence of the legisla∣ture itself which ordained it is formed so that such an  unnatural Act  of the state would be parallel to the crime of  felo de se  in a private person and being thus contrary to  the nature  of things can never be  rendered valid  by any Authority whatsoever  Quae rerum naturâ prohibentur NULLA LEGE confirmata sunt  Finch  And  Nihil quod est  contra rationem  est licitum  Co Lit  And in∣deed it is laid down as a maxim by the great Lord Sommers that  no man or society of men have  power to deliver up their preservation  or the means of it to the  absolute Will  of any man  or men  and they will have always a right to preserve what they have not  power to part with  P  And if a politic society has no just power to de∣liver up even  its own  preservation it cer∣tainly has  much less right  to deliver up the necessary preservation of other so∣cieties of their brethren and friends not represented among them  without their Consent  and all such attempts must neces∣sarily be deemed  void  and ineffectual be∣cause  there is no necessity to obey where there is  no authority  to ordain  Ubi non est condendi authoritas ibi non est parendi necessitas  Dav  And  Judicium a non suo judice datum nullius est momenti  Co  For as it so clearly appears from what has been said that  Natural Equity  does not permit even  the inferior Property  of lands  goods  chattels or money to be alienated without the  consent  or  fault  of the proprietors much less can it permit the alienation annulling or changing of our  most valuable inheritance the Law  without the  due assent and consent  of  the  heritors  themselves the People at large or their lawful Representatives in their respective assemblies or parliaments  Nam non potest rex Angliae ad  libitum suum leges mutare regni  sui Principatu nam que nedum  regali  sed

reason and commonsense  drawn from the effect and force of  Natural Equity  even in cases of much less consequence  viz  respecting goods and common pecuniary property so that the distinction which some great and able politicians have lately made between  Taxation  and  Legislation  in the late disputes about taxing the Co∣lonies was certainly  erroneous  though well intended since it plainly appears that the right of  Legislation  is not less  inseparable by  Natural Equity  from the people of every part of the British Empire than the right of  granting or withholding Taxes  for otherwise the free subjects of  one part  of the empire would be liable to be most materially in∣jured in their  greatest  and most valuable inheritance  the Law  by the hasty de∣cisions of men on the  other side of  the empire with whom probably they would be totally unacquainted and whose in∣terest might perhaps be as widely  differ∣ent  from theirs for any thing they could know to the contrary as their  situation  upon the face of the globe  is distant  that is as widely  different as the East is from the West  Would this be equita∣ble could such notorious  Injustice  Si a  jure  discedas vagus eris

instance  the baneful influence of such an evil prece∣dent will soon prepare the way for the  Destruction of the whole Law  because  uno absurdo dato infinita sequuntur  Coke  be ever made lawful The true consti∣tutional mode of  connecting  British Do∣minions that are otherwise separated by  Nature  is demonstrated by the esta∣blished example of the Union of GreatBritain and Ireland which by long ex∣perience has proved to be sufficiently ef∣fectual It must be acknowledged in∣deed that an Act of Parliament was made in the th of K George I chap wherein it is laid down that  the King and Parliament of GreatBritain  may make Laws to bind Ireland  If the preceding arguments are not sufficient to prove in what light the said Act is to be considered yet the present  distinct and separate Jurisdiction  of  the Irish Parliament  the Continuation of their  ancient  and  constitutional Privileges  notwithstanding the doctrine asserted in the said Act and their annual Transactions both in  Taxation  and  Legislation  are  Facts  which prove  better than Arguments  that the people of Ire∣land  have an inherent Right to enact Laws indepen∣dent of the British Parliament otherwise the King's  Assent  would not be sufficient to render the said laws  valid and binding  without the especial approbation and consent also of the British Parliament which indeed is  never required so far is it from being necessary  And farther the inhabitants of GreatBritain would think it extremely unreasonable and unjust if the Parlia∣ment of Ireland should claim a Right of making Laws with the King's assent to  bind any part of this Island  The argument is reciprocal so that if we should really detest such a measure against ourselves  the Law of Laws  forbids us to claim the like power over any of our fellowsubjects without their free consent  "Non facias alteri quod tibi non vis fieri"  This is laid down as one of the most common precepts of the  Law of Reason  Doct and Stud c p and such is the immutability of the  Law of Reason  that against it there can be no  prescription statute  or  cus∣tom  and if any are made contrary thereto they are not to be esteemed  statutes  or  customs  but  corruptlae i e  Corruptions or Depravities  Non sunt sta∣tuta sive consuetudines sed  corruptelae  Doct and Stud c p  To the same effect is that Com∣mand of Christ himself recorded in Matt vii which our Lord declared to be  the Law and the Pro∣phets  viz  Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is  THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS  so that it may justly be intitled the  Law of Laws  and a statute therefore which is contrary thereto is  doubly unlawful  The separate interests of the two Kingdoms are suffi∣ciently restrained with respect to each other by our excellent Constitution of State which requires  the As∣sent of the People  that is of those which are concerned respectively to render any  Law valid  and  binding  upon either nation which the foregoing arguments demonstrate and I hope the ingenious and sensible author of the argument in defence of the Colonies lately published will acknowledge that he has al∣lowed too much when he admits in page that  the whole kingdom of Ireland is bound by the Acts of the supreme Legislature  c  which doctrine leads him afterwards to make a distinction between Taxation and Legislation  And again the two kingdoms are so firmly united by the  bands of Allegiance  to  one Head  or Monarchy of  limited power  that their interests in all material  ex∣ternal  exigences are thereby  rendered mutual  as well as their  internal  interest in the maintenance of  natural  and  constitutional Liberty  in each kingdom respectively because one of them cannot be deprived of this as they are governed by  the same Head  without hast∣ening the destruction of the other And this intimate connexion of  mutual interest  in the constitution of state and in the reciprocal enjoyment of the  same rea∣sonable common Law  whereby each kingdom enjoys an Equality of privilege and natural freedom ren∣ders the Union of the two kingdoms  more just and equitable  and consequently  more safe and durable  than it could possibly have been made by any other means and the inhabitants of both islands though sprung from a variety of jarring jealous and fierce nations have by these means acquired a certain  mu∣tual consideration  for each other as  fellowsubjects  which could never have been produced by mere alliances guarantees or defensive leagues nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever than that by which divine Providence has effected it  viz  the English Constitution this has firmly united the  Strength  of the two Islands whereby reciprocal succour in time of need is insured to both  But  as it does not appear that the Parliament of Ireland ever acknowledged or gave  any  formal Assent  to the said Act the same must necessarily be considered as a  mere assertion  on  one part  at the making of which the persons most materially concerned on  the other part  were neither HEARD  nor represented  a defect  Qui aliquid statuerit parte  inaudita altera  licet aequum dixerit  haud aequum  fecerit  so that if any act is ever so just in itself yet it becomes  other∣wise  that is  unjust and iniquitous  as is before re∣marked by the want of these legal formalities  the most notorious that can possibly be attri∣buted to any proceeding either in the  enacting  or  execution of Laws  and there∣fore it is to very little purpose to cite the said Act as a Precedent for taxing the American Subjects  without their Consent  for the privileges which the Parliament of Ireland has maintained and enjoyed both before and since that time clearly distinct and separate from the British Parliament afford a better and more authentic precedent on the  other side of the question    viz  in behalf of the peo∣ple's  natural Rights  than the Act itself does against them for as the King and the People including the Lords and Commons of GreatBritain constitute the  sovereign Power  under God or Le∣gislature of GreatBritain so the King and the People of Ireland are the natu∣ral and constitutional Legislature or State of that kingdom and actually exercise both in  Legislation and Taxation  their distinct jurisdiction to this day which is the best proof of their Right and in like manner according to this ancient and established legal precedent the King together with the People of every dis∣tinct province subject to the imperial  Crown of GreatBritain and detached as Ireland is from this island ought to be and have been esteemed from the first establishment of our colonies the only proper and constitutional Legisla∣ture for  each province respectively  Every establishment in the American Colonies has been settled by our ancestors as nearly as possible to the constitutional form of government in the Mo∣therCountry and as the advantages of this mode have been proved by the experience of more than a century see an argument just published in defence of the exclusive Right claimed by the Colonies to tax themselves p it is very dangerous now that the colonies begin to be filled with people to vary the ancient and approved Form of the Consti∣tution  Periculosum est res novas et inusitatas indu∣cere  Co Lit  And  Clausulae inconsuetae semper inducunt suspicionem  Co  And again  Quae praeter consuetudinem et morem majorum fiunt neque placent neque recta videntur  Co  And lastly  Whatsoever is against the Rule of Law is inconvenient  Co Lit p  because the  Representation of the People  in every part of the British Empire is absolutely necessary to constitute an  ef∣fectual Legislature  according to the fun∣damental principles of the English Con∣stitution for none of them  separately  can be esteemed a  competent Legislature  to judge of the other's  Rights  without the highest injustice and  iniquity  which is before demonstrated by some of the first maxims or principles of  Reason  And yet howsoever distinct these seve∣ral parts or provinces may seem in point of situation as well as in the exercise of a separate legislative power for each which constitutional Right they have enjoyed beyond the memory of man they are nevertheless firmly united by the circle of the British Diadem so as to form  one vast Empire  which will never be divided if the safe and honest policy be adopted of maintaining the  British Constitution  inviolate in all parts of the Empire for it is a system so  natural  so  beneficial  and so  engaging  to the ge∣nerality of mankind that by the same means we might hold  the Empire of the World  were the laws of natural Equity Justice and Liberty to be strictly ob∣served  and the  abomination  of  domestic  The toleration of domestic Slavery in the Colo∣nies greatly weakens the claim or  natural Right  of our American Brethren to Liberty Let them put away  the accursed thing  that horrid  Oppression  from among them before they presume to implore the interposition of  divine Justice  for whilst they retain their  brethren of the world  in the most shameful involuntary servitude it is profane in them to look up to the  merciful  Lord of all and call him  Father  as well as political Slavery abolished  On the other hand it is not only  Trea∣son against the Constitution  to attempt to deprive any free British Subjects of their  natural Right  to a Share in the  Legis∣lature  To extend the Governor's Right to com∣mand and Subject's Duty to obey beyond the Laws of one's country  said that learned lawyer Lord Sommers  is TREASON against the Constitu∣tion and Treachery to the society whereof we are members  Judgement of whole Kingdoms  c  p  but it is equally derogatory and injurious to the Authority of the Crown  Nor is it merely the first and highest  Treason  in  itself  that a member of a political society is ca∣pable of committing  to go about to subvert the Con∣stitution  but it is also the  greatest Treason  he can perpetrate against the  Person Crown and Dignity of the King  for such an endeavour both annuls and vacates all his title to superiority over those above whom he was exalted from the common le∣vel by  virtue of the Constitution  and deprives him of all rightful and legal claim of rectoral au∣thority over the society by destroying the alone foundation upon which it was erected and by which he became vested with it  c  Ibid p  because a King of Eng∣land  has no  legal Authority  to govern by any other mode than that  limited  go∣vernment called the  English Constitution  which he is sworn to maintain for such is the frailty of human nature that no man or body of men whatever is to be entrusted with the administration of go∣vernment unless they are  thus limited by Law  and by a due Representation of the people at large subject to a frequent appeal  by Election  to the whole body of constituents for it is a maxim  that he who is allowed

dated Febru∣ary  I have also sent you a book lately pub∣lished by Dr respecting the go∣vernment of the British Colonies  The reason of my sending the latter is not because I approve of it or have the  least connexion with the author but on the contrary that you and your friends in America may be aware of the uncon∣stitutional doctrines which are thereby propagated amongst us I have not in∣deed had opportunity to peruse it re∣gularly neither do I now think it ne∣cessary to do so for I was lucky enough when I first took it up to turn over a few pages in the fourth part containing five propositions upon the point in ques∣tion whereby the author's sentiments and intentions may be sufficiently known without descending to his arguments up∣on them for  not one  of them not even the th and last which he himself pre∣fers can possibly be reconciled either to  Law Equity  or  sound Politicks  so that if the doctor with the  same neglect of Law and constitutional Principles  had multiplied his propositions to the number of  an hundred times five  he would not have been able to lay down a plan or  mode of government tolerably suitable to the case before him because in this as in many other things there is but  one right  though very many  wrong  me∣thods of proceeding and the doctor has unfortunately forgot to state the  only right proposition  upon the subject in question that can be admitted consistently with the necessary principles abovementioned of  Law Equity and sound Politicks  viz to  do justice  to our brethren of A∣merica that is to govern them accord∣ing to the established Principles of the English Constitution and known Laws of the Land and candidly to acknow∣ledge their  unalienable  right to the same happy privileges by which the liberties of the mothercountry have hitherto been maintained the most essential of which is the privilege of paying no other taxes than what are voluntarily granted by  the people  or their  legal representatives  in general councils or parliaments  Dris inexcusable for having o∣mitted this  sixth Proposition  for he can∣not be ignorant of the legal and  established mode of extending the English Constitution to countries detached from this island  be∣cause we have a standing precedent and example which has long subsisted and has been universally allowed in the present government of  Ireland  for that island though unjustly  conquered  by our ances∣tors enjoys or at least is allowed to be entitled to the same constitutional privileges as the seat of empire England itself The respective Parliaments of the two islands are  entirely independent of each other  they  separately  grant from time to time the necessary supplies to the state and no man may presume to deny their right of enquiring respectively into the application of them But not∣withstanding this distinct oeconomy and the entire independency of the natives or  subjects with respect to each other yet they are firmly united by the  bands of allegiance  to  one  Head or Monarchy of  limited power  whereby they enjoy the privileges of the  same reasonable common Law  and the  same excellent Constitution  of state so that the equality of  privilege  and  condition  renders the  Union  more just and equitable and consequently more safe and durable than it could possibly have been made by any other means  And the inhabitants of both islands though sprung from a variety of jarring jealous and fierce nations have by this means acquired a certain  mutual consideration  for each other as  fellowsubjects  which could never have been produced by mere alliances guarantees or defensive leagues nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever than that by which Divine Providence has effected it  viz  the English Con∣stitution  This has firmly united the  strength  of the two islands whereby reciprocal suc∣cour in time of need is insured to both This  established example  of the true con∣stitutional mode of connecting British Dominions that are otherwise separated by Nature will enable us by compari∣son to discern the illegality and injustice of Dr's five Propositions The stately vine of British Dominion if I may use that scriptural type has pro∣videntially extended its luxuriant branches to the most distant parts of the earth and will continue to spread and increase as long as  Justice  and  the Laws of Li∣berty  are duly maintained by those who are entrusted with the administration of government unless the wickedness of  individuals  manifested by the exercise of  domestic Slavery  and  Oppression  in the Co∣lonies and of  political Corruption and Venality  at home with the  growing vices  attending  both  respectively should un∣happily draw down God's vengeance upon us and perhaps our mutual pu∣nishment is at this time impending in the present differences and ignorance of the English Constitution But how will the trunk or stock of the British Vine appear if we should entirely separate or lop off the branchesThe American Branches are already  detached  indeed in point of distance and widely sepa∣rated from the Trunk by a vast Ocean but the imperial Crown of GreatBritain is nevertheless a sufficient band of u∣nion or connexion between them it be∣ing the legal ensign of authority for the maintenance and execution of the same just laws the influence of which may by a due constitutional exertion of the regal Power be circulated like whole∣some sap from the root to the most dis∣tant branches  But if according to Dr's th proposition the flourishing branches of NorthAmerica were to be  entirely sepa∣rated  from the trunk and excluded from the  circle  of the royal  diadem  the effect would be  reciprocally humiliating  for the act of separation would at the same time unavoidably  contract  the  imperial Authority of the British Empire  to the narrow limits of British and Irish ground except a few small SugarIslands peo∣pled chiefly by the most miserable of slaves so that both  GreatBritain  and her  Colonies  would reciprocally lose  im∣portance strength  and  security  by the disunion A Guarantee of independence against all foreign invaders as proposed by Dr would fall far short of the effect which we enjoy by the present constitution because it would not like the latter produce that  mutual considera∣tion and protection  which are due from  fellowsubjects  Our connexion accord∣ing to the doctor's measure would be upon no better footing than Alliances of the same kind with detached foreign Powers which as experience teaches us subsist no longer than the  private in∣terest  or  separate  views of the contracting parties  If all these points are duly considered the very proposing so pernicious a mea∣sure must appear highly criminal if not treasonable especially as the author has been pleased to insinuate that there is no alternative  If we neither can govern the Americans  says he  nor be governed by them if we can neither unite with them nor ought to subdue them what remains  says he  but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can  But is it not Trea∣son against the Crown to insinuate that the Americans cannot be  governed  as  well as Treason against the People at large to say that we cannot  unite  with our American Brethren when there is a constitutional mode both of  Government  and  Union  established by law and an unquestionable precedent the observance of which would undoubtedly satisfy every honest American Subject  The advocates for the jurisdiction of the British  Parliament in America  like all promoters of bad measures will not fail to represent those that oppose them as licentious and disaffected persons and therefore as it is highly necessary for the general  welfare  and subsistence of the British Empire both in Europe Asia and America upon the principles already explained that we should strictly main∣tain our  Loyalty to the Crown  at the same time that we steadily assert our le∣gal and constitutional RightsI think we ought to lose no proper opportunity  of expressing our  personal attachment  to the  King and the royal Family  who in themselves indeed are truly amiable and worthy of esteem but it is very diffi∣cult in this world to guard against misrepresentation and bad advice how∣ever I trust that a steady perseverance in  Love and Duty  will be the true means of your prevailing in the end as it will prove that your opposition is not occa∣sioned either by disaffection or disloyalty but is  truly legal  and  constitutional  I am with great esteem Dear Sir Your

should contain any condition or acknowledge∣ment on the part of the landholders which may seem to militate against the foregoing observations I must beg leave to add that the legislature hath agreed and laid down as a rule that all the ancient arbitrary and military Tenures of land and even  Socage  in capite  of the King and the  consequents upon the same  have been much more burthen∣some  grievous and prejudicial to the Kingdom than they have been beneficial to the King  see preamble to the Act of th of Charles II chap for ta∣king away  the Court of Wards and Live∣ries and Tenures in

Te∣nures by KnightsService either of the King or others or by KnightsService  in capite  or Soccage  in capite  of the King and the consequents upon the same have been much more burthensome grie∣vous and prejudicial  c  the Crown hath ever since been restrained by the Law from  granting "any Manors  Lands  c  " upon such or indeed  any other conditions whatsoever  than  "free and common Socage only"  See d and th Sections of the said Act  I have heard indeed that a certain island in the northern part of America was granted to a noble lord with a par∣ticular jurisdiction upon the ancient feu∣dal plan whereby he is said to have been established as  Lord Paramount  with a peculiar unconstitutional authority but this I am willing to presume is merely report and even if it were true the Grant would be innocent enough in its  effects provided the people be instructed in their Rights because all such undue conditions as I have mentioned are ab∣solutely  null and void  in themselves for the law obliges us to construe them as if they had no other meaning than a  legal Grant  of lands  in free and common so∣cage  See the th section of the said Act  And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that  all Te∣nures  there is none excepted  here∣after to be created by the King's Ma∣jesty his heirs or successors upon  any  Gifts or Grants of  any  Manors Lands Tenements or

DECLARATION Or DEFENCE of the same DOCTRINE  Viz  The Natural Right of the People to a Share in the Legislature When applied particularly TO THE  PEOPLE of IRELAND  In ANSWER to the ASSERTIONS of several EMINENT WRITERS on that Point which have hitherto been permitted to pass without due ANIMADVERSION  WHEN the First Part of this De∣claration was sent to the Press I was not aware that there had been any con∣troversy before the sixth of King  George  I concerning the freedom of our fellow subjects in  Ireland  or that any English∣man acquainted with the principles of  our excellent constitution of State had ever before that time presumed to ad∣vance any Doctrine which might tend to deprive our Irish Brethren of their  na∣tural freedom  and of the inestimable be∣nefits of that happy legal constitution which British Subjects in general are commonly supposed to inherit by BIRTH∣RIGHT  But I have since had the mortification to find that such great Authorities as Lord Coke Judge Jenkins Lord Chief Justice Vaughan Judge Blackstone the Honourable Mr Justice Barrington  c  might be quoted in favour of a contrary Doctrine And as I have mentioned the Union between GreatBritain and Ireland in the First Part of this Declaration  c  as an Example of  the true constitution∣al mode of connecting British Domi∣nions that are otherwise separated by nature  I thought myself therefore  obliged to search and examine the grounds upon which these grew and learned men have founded their opinions that if they should have  Truth  on their side they might have the credit of it but if not that the  Truth  of this important ques∣tion when plainly and impartially stated might prevent for the future any such undue pretensions on the one hand and jealousies on the other as have too fre∣quently occasioned misunderstandings and controversies between the Subjects of the two Kingdoms  Lord Hussey Chief Justice in the Reign of King  Henry  VII seems to have been the First who ventured publicly to assert that  Statutes made in England shall bind the Subject of Ireland  Hussey Chief Justice disoit que les Statuts falts on Angleterre liera ceux de Ireland que ne suit moult  d  s autres Justices nient obstant que a  c  n de oux  furent en coutrarid opinione  le derrein term en son absence  Year Book Hen VII p    And though the Doctrine is unconstitu∣tional and dangerous if admitted in a ge∣neral unlimited sense  Which is clearly proved by Sir Richard Bolton Chancellor of Ireland in the Declaration  c  printed in Harris's Hibernica p  As to the Opinion of Hussy Chief Justice in first of Hen fol  that the Statutes made in England shall bind them of Ireland  this Opinion as it is put by him generally  cannot be law  for Brooke in abridging  that case in title Par∣liament  Sect saith that that  opinion was denied to be law the last term before  and added further  ta∣men nota that Ireland is a Realm of itself and hath a Parliament in itself implying thereby that Ireland could not be bound but by a Parliament of Ireland  And according to that is the opinion of the Judges in th Hen VI fol in John Pilkington's case and in d Rich III fol II in the Merchants of Wa∣terford's case before remembered and likewise con∣trary to the opinion of Hussy are the judgements of eight several Parliaments in Ireland before the Sta∣tute of th of Hen VII viz th of Edw II th of Edw II th of Hen VI th of Hen VI d Hen VI th Hen VI and th Edw IV And since the Statute th Hen VII of five Parliaments viz th of Hen VIII d of Hen VIII th of Eliz th of Jam and th Car besides the Statute of th of Hen VII itself  yet in justice to Judge Hussey it must be allowed that his Declaration was certainly right with respect to the particular case then before  him which related to the  exportation of goods from Waterford  for the Irish sub∣jects themselves do not deny the juris∣diction of GreatBritain upon the high Seas nor in matters of external  This binding in external transactions seems to be allowed though unwillingly by Mr Molly neux a zealous asserter of the liberties of Ireland in the Reign of King William "They seem" says he speaking of English Acts of Parliament  at the ut∣most reach to extend the jurisdiction of the English Parliament over the subjects of Ireland only  in rela∣tion to their action beyond seas out of the Realm of Ire∣land as they are the King of England's subjects  c  p  com∣merce though the English power even in that respect may sometimes perhaps have been extended farther than reason and equity can fairly warrant But before Lord Chief Justice Hussy delivered his opinion this proper distinction concern∣ing the English Acts binding the Irish  in external Transactions  had been made in his absence by the other Judges in  a preceding term  "All the Judges" but we must except Hussy  were assembled in the Exchequer Chamber and there with respect to the first question it was said that the lands of Ireland have a Parliament among themselves and all kinds of Courts as in England and by the same Parliament they make laws and change laws and are not bound by Statutes made in England because they have not here

Anglia  c  which accounts for the remark of the Reporter that this opi∣nion  of Chief Justice Hussy  was not much denied by the other Judges though some of them were of a contra∣ry opinion the last term in his absence  But by the expression that  it was not much denied  it is apparent that the other Judges did not receive the doctrine of Chief Justice Hussy entirely and ab∣solutely without  some demur  which could only consist in their adding that  due distinction  beforementioned for it plain∣ly appears notwithstanding the assertion of the Reporter that they were not really of  a contrary opinion  in the for∣mer term with respect to the case before them which related to an  external tran∣saction  the same that in their former opi∣nion they declared to be subject to the  controul of England and therefore there was no reason why they should  much deny  the opinion of Chief Justice Hus∣sy since the particular case before them did not require it  But the like excuse cannot be made for Sir Edward Coke who in Calvin's case seems to have adopted the opinion of Chief Justice Hussy and yet has not considered the nature of the case on which the same was delivered having declared a similar opinion in an indiscriminate ge∣neral sense  That albeit Ireland was a distinct Dominion yet the title thereof being by conquest the same by judgement of law might by express words be bound by Act of Parliament of England  Calvin's Case th Rep p  without paying the least regard to that  just distinction  between  the external  and  internal  Government of Ire∣land which the other Judges had

constitutional Lawyer the great Judge Fortescue on Pilkington's  et auxi la terre de Ireland est severe del' Roiaume d' Angleterre car si un disme ou quin∣zime soit grante icy ceo  ne liera ceux d'

the opinion of all the other Judges that were then present for Sir Richard Bolton remarks that this was not  de∣nied by Markham Yelverton and  Ascough  The case is stated by Sir Richard Bolton Chancellor of Ireland in his Declaration c print∣ed in Harris's Hibernica p as follows  That one John Pilkington brought a scire facias against one A to shew cause why Letters Patents whereby the King had granted an office in Ire∣land to the said A should not be repealed whereas the said John Pilkington had the same Office grant∣ed him by former Letters Patents granted by the same King to occupy to himself or his Deputy Whereupon the said A was warned and appeared and said 'That the  land of Ireland time beyond the memory of man hath been a land separated and severed from the Realm of England  and ruled and  governed by the customs and laws of the same land of Ireland  And that the Lords of the same land which are of the King's Council have used from time to time in the  absence of the King to elect a Justice  which Justice so elected hath power to pardon and punish all felo∣nies trespasses  c and to assemble a Parliament  and by the advice of the Lords and  Commonalty to make Statutes and he alledgeth further  that a Parliament was assembled and that it was ordained by the said Parliament that every man who had any office with∣in the said land before a certain day  and he puts the day in certain  shall occupy the said Office by himself or otherwise that he shall forfeit his office  And sheweth further  how the said John Pilkington oc∣cupied the said office by a deputy and that inso∣much as he came not in proper person to reside upon his office before the day that his office was void  and that the King by his Letters Patents granted the said office so become void to the said A and prayed that the said Letters Patents should be effec∣tual and not repealed' And upon the plea the said John Pilkington demurred in law In the ar∣gument of which case it was debated by the Judges Yelverton Fortescue Portington Markham and Ascough whether the said prescription were good or void in law Yelverton and Portington held the prescription void  but Fortesine Markham and As∣cough  held the prescription good and that the  Let∣ters Patents made to A were good and effectual  and ought not to be repeated and in the argument of this case it was agreed by Fortescue and Portington  that if a tenth or fifteenth be granted by Parliament in England  that shall not  bind them in Ireland  although the King send the same  Statute into Ireland under his great seal except they in Ireland will in their Parlia∣ment approve it  but if they will  approve it then it shall bind in Ireland  And Portington said that if a tenth be granted in the Parliament of England  that shall not bind in Ireland  because they have not any  commandment by writ to come to our Parliament  and this was not denied by Markham Yelverton or Ascough Upon this case these points following are to be observed First that the Lords of the Council of Ireland had then power in the  absence of the King and vacancy of a Lieutenant or Deputy to elect a Justice  and that is plainly proved by the preamble of the Statutes of d of Hen VIII chap in Ireland The words are these 'For as much as continually  sithens the conquest of this Realm of Ireland it hath been used in this same Realm of Ireland that at every such time as it hath chaunced the same Realm to be destitute of a Lieutenant Deputy Justice or other head Governour by death surrender or de∣parture out of the said Realm or otherwise the Council of this Realm of Ireland for the time be∣ing have used by the laws and usages of the same to assemble themselves  together to choose and elect a Justice to be Ruler and Governor of this Realm  till the King's Highness had deputed and ordained a Lieutenant Deputy or other Governor for the same Realm which Justice so being elected was and hath been always by the ancient laws and customs of this said Realm of Ireland authorised to do and exercise the said roume of Deputy there for the good rule and governance and leading of the King's sub∣jects within the said Realm of Ireland and in mi∣nistration of Justice with divers other authorities preeminences and jurisdictions there which usage election and authority of the said Justice hath been many times ratified and confirmed by divers Statutes in this Realm provided and made But this order of election of a Justice is now by the laid Sta∣tute of d of Hen VIII altered as by the said Statute more at large may appear  Sir John Fortescue had declared that  if a tenth or fif∣teenth  were granted here this should not bind those of Ireland even though  the King should send the same Statute into Ireland under his great seal ex∣cept they will in their Parliament ap∣prove it but if they will allow it  i e  then it shall be held there  and they shall be bound by it  And to this point Judge Portington expressly declared his assent  et auxi quant a ceo que Fortescue ad dit que si un Disme soit grante en le Parliament icy  ceo ne liera ceux  d' Ireland  Jeo veux bien pur ceo que ils n'ont commandment  ove nous per breve de venir al' Parliament  Year Book th Hen VI p  "Jeo veux bien" says he and then assigns the incontes∣tible reason  "pur ceo"  because they the Irish subjects  have no summons with us to come to Parliament  But Lord Coke has unfortunately ne∣glected to weigh the importance of this just  Reason  and consequently has been led to misconstrue the doctrine to which it has at different times been applied by the Judges for in Calvin's Case th Rep p he cites the opinion of the Judges in d Rich III beforementioned  viz  That Ireland hath a Parliament and they make laws  and our Statutes do not bind them  and he cites also their reason  viz  because they do not  send Knights to  our  Parliament  but he adds in a parenthesis that  this is to be understood  unless they be espe∣cially named  And d Rich III  says he  Hiber∣nia habet Parliamentum et faciunt leges et nostra Statuta non ligant eos quia non mittunt Milites ad Parliamentum  which is to be understood unless they be especially named  sed personae eorum sunt subjecti Regis sicut habitantes in Calesia Gasconia et Guyan  c  Calvin's Case Rep p  Thus he is so far from perceiving the weight of  the Reason  assigned by the former Judges that he has ventured to set it aside as if it had no meaning at all by the insertion of an arbitrary parenthesis in the middle of the sentence without assigning a stronger  Reason  or even any  Reason  at all for his authority and therefore we are certain∣ly bound to prefer the Declaration of the other Judges who founded their opinion on  a clear legal Reason  that has never yet been disproved for  the REASON  of the Law is the Life  of the Law  "Ratio Legis est anima Legis"  Jenk Cent p    The  naming  or  not naming  Ireland in our English Acts cannot in the least affect the argument of the former Judges for if it holds good to secure the Irish sub∣jects from being bound  when not "espe∣cially named"  which is allowed even by Sir Edward Coke himself it certain∣ly is equally effectual  when they are na∣med  or rather I ought to say the Rea∣son is much more forcible in the latter case which apparently enhances the propriety and importance of it because when the business relating to Ireland is debated it is manifest that the Irish sub∣jects stand most in need of a  due repre∣sentation  which cannot therefore be de∣nied them at such a time without the most flagrant violation of Justice and na∣tunal Equity  But lest any of my Readers should still retain any doubt concerning the ground∣less Doctrine broached by Sir Edward  Coke that English Statutes bind in Ire∣land when  "especially named"  I have yet another Authority to add which must needs turn the scale being no less than the testimony even of Sir Edward Coke himself upon this very point Let his own words judge him  He informs us in his th Inst cap p that  sometimes the King of England called his Nobles of Ire∣land to  come to his Parliament of Eng∣land  c and after reciting the form of the Writ used on such occasions  Octobris Rex affectans pacificum Statum terrae Hiberniae mandavit Richardo de Bur∣go Com Ulton et aliis nobilibus terrae predictae quod sint ad Parliamentum suum quod summoneri fecit apud Westm in octabus sancti Hillarii prox∣ad tractand ibid cum proceribus c regni sui su∣per Statu terrae praedictae  Rot Parl E m  he adds"an excellent President"says he  to be followed  whensoever any Act of Parliament shall be made in England concerning the Statute of Ireland  c  But if this be  "an excellent President"  the same spirit of justice which inclines us to approve it as such must needs force us to condemn  the opposite notion  con∣cerning mere English Statutes  hinding Ireland  when  "especially named"  and consequently it must appear that Lord Coke was not sufficiently upon his guard when he advanced this unjust Doctrine And yet alas he has repeated the same in this very page immediately after the Information before quoted concerning the Nobles of Ireland being summoned to the Parliament of England for he adds"and  by special words  " says he  the Parliament of England  may bind the Subjects of Ireland  c  but it lucklly happens that he is less reserved in this place than in the other passage al∣ready is asserted for here he has attempt∣ed to justify his opinion by an example which out of respect to so great an au∣thor  we may of course presume to be the very best that could have been pro∣duced for that purpose especially since he mentions it as  one example for many  and yet happily for the truth this  "one example for many"  proves no∣thing so much when duly considered as the direct contrary to his assertion about  binding Ireland  by  special words  c for it amounts to an  implied acknowledgment upon public re∣cord  of the injustice of pretending to  "bind the Subjects of Ireland"  without their express consent being in reality a copy of the King's Writ before∣mentioned to summon the  Nobles of Ireland  to the Parliament at West∣minster  there  to treat with the No∣bles  c  of his Kingdom  upon the State of the said Land  i e  Ireland Thus it is plain that the English Legis∣lature even so early as in the Reign of Edward II by whom the Writ was is∣sued  did not esteem it equitable to de∣bate "upon  the State of the said Land  " "super statu terrae praedictae" with∣out some legislative representation there∣of But besides this  one example for all  Sir Edward Coke has given us also in the same page a memorandum from the Parliament Rolls of the th of Edw III  Rot Parl E irrot sic  Anno E de concilio fummonit pro terr habentibus in Hibernia  Maria Comitissa Norf ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Aelianora Com Orm ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Jana la Despencer ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Philippa Com de la Marche ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Johanna Fitzwater ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Agnes Com Penbroke ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Margaretta de Roos ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Matildis Com Ox∣oniae ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  Catherina Com Athol ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium  of Writs being issued  even to Peeresses  who in their own right held lands in Ireland and of these no less than nine to summon them to send Representatives or proper persons to confer with the Parliament  ad mit∣tendum fide dignos ad colloquium  And consequently if Lord Coke's Doc∣trine for which he has cited these ex∣amples had in those early times been current  viz  that  by  special words  the Parliament of England may bind the Subjects of Ireland  it is apparent that the same could not have been un∣derstood in any other light than that of  including  a due representation of the Irish Parliament  within  the Parliament of England which the examples them∣selves sufficiently demonstrate  In the same page likewise th Inst p Lord Coke has produced still more evidence to prove the  Parliamentary Rights of the Irish Subjects  for he cites the Parliament rolls of th of Edw II  De Parliamentis  singulis annis  in Hibernia tenendis et de legibus et consuetudinibus  ibidem  emendandis  and he remarks thereupon"Hereby it appeareth" says he  that there  were  Parliaments  holden in Ireland  before this time and order taken at this Parliament  says he  that they should be holden  every year  and the like Acts were made in England in th E III and th E III for Parliaments to be holden in England  so that regular  annual  Parliaments were established  in Ireland  BEFORE  they were in England  And  that this was really the case is clearly proved by some other English records cited by Mr Mollyneux in his Case of Ireland pp and whereby it appears that even  Knights of the Shires Citizens and Burgesses were elected in the Shires Cities and Boroughs  of Ireland  to serve in Par∣liament  in England  "Formerly" says Mr Mollyneux "when Ireland was but thinly peopled and the English laws not fully current in all parts of the Kingdom it is probable that then they could not frequently assemble with conveniency or safety to make laws in their own Parliament at home and therefore du∣ring the heats of rebellions or confusion of the times they were forced to enact laws in England But then this was always by their proper Represen∣tatives For we find that in the Reign of Edward the Third and by what foregoes it is plain it  was so in Edward the First's time Knights of the Shire Citizens and Burgesses were elected in the Shires Ci∣ties and Boroughs of Ireland to serve in Parliament in England  and have so served accordingly For amongst the records of the Tower of London Roe Claus Edward the Third Parl Memb we find a writ from the King at Westminster di∣rected to James Butler Lord Justice of Ireland and to R Archbishop of Dublin his Chancellor re∣quiring them to issue writs under the great Seal of Ireland to the several Counties Cities and Bo∣roughs for satisfying the expences of the men of that land who last came over to serve in Parliament in England And in another roll the th of Edw III Membr on complaint to the King by John Draper who was chosen Burgess of Cork by writ and served in the Parliament of England and yet was denied his expences by some of the Citizens care was taken to reimburse him  If from these last mentioned records it be con∣cluded that the Parliament of England may bind Ireland it must also be allowed that the people of Ireland ought to have their Representatives in the Parliament of England And this I believe we should be willing enough to embrace but this is in happiness we can hardly hope for  This sending of Representatives out of Ireland to the Parliament in England on some occasions was found in process of time to be very troublesome and inconvenient and this we may presume was the reason that afterwards when times were more settled we fell again into our old track and regu∣lar course of Parliaments in our own country and hereupon the laws aforenoted page were en∣acted establishing that  no law made in the Parliament of England should be of force in Ireland till it was al∣lowed and published in Parliament here  which an∣cient  privilege of the  Irish Commoned  has either been unknown or also over∣looked  and forgot by Lord Coke and indeed it is not probable that the Irish Parliament was ever summoned to Eng∣land  regularly  or as a matter  of course  to meet the English Parliament but only on extraordinary occasions wherein the Subjects of Ireland were particularly con∣cerned and could not we may pre∣sume be "  specially named  " and bound that is consistently with  natural equity  and their own  just rights  without their express assent for it is apparent that  re∣gular Parliaments  were held  in Ireland  both BEFORE  since  and even  during the Reigns of those very Princes  who issued writs to summon them to  England  which latter therefore can only be attri∣buted to some extraordinary or peculiar circumstances out of common course which rendered it necessary  In addition to the clear Precedents be∣fore cited it may not perhaps be impro∣per to take notice of a circumstance  quoted by the Honourable Mr Justice Barrington from Petyt MSS Vol XXVII p for though it is not a Precedent exactly to the point in ques∣tion  i e  the sending Representatives from Ireland to the  English Parliament  yet it tends to corroborate the same equi∣table Doctrine concerning the necessity of  Representation  in general which ought to be the basis of all determinations ei∣ther in the  Privy Council  to which the example particularly relates or else∣where  There is a writ says he of Edward III in the th Year of his Reign to oblige the Inhabitants of  Cork  to pay the expences of  John Droup  who is stated to have  been cho∣sen by the Community to attend the King's Privy Council in England  "Observations on the more ancient Statutes" c p    The Business of his attendance however does not appear but on whatever account he might attend  the Privy Council  he was  probably the same person that is men∣tioned in the record before cited from Mr Mollyneux by the name of  John Draper  who was chosen Burgess of  Cork  by Writ and served in the Par∣liament of England  for as the other circumstances correspond both with re∣spect to  the place  from whence he came and  the year  of his being sent it is natu∣ral to conclude that the small disagree∣ment in the name may have been occa∣sioned by some accidental mistake  viz John Droup  for  John Draper  or  vice versa  and he might serve the Inhabi∣tants of  Cork  in the double capacity of  Representative in Parliament  and Agent for them to the  Privy Council  or per∣haps his summons and attendance even at the  King's Privy Council  might have been in his  parliamentary  capacity for if a due Representation from Ireland was to attend the King here  in his Privy Council  such an Assembly might with∣out  danger I apprehend be allowed all the powers of an  effectual Legislative to bind Ireland  provided the respective branches of Irish Representation be pre∣served entire and distinct for the  En∣glish Privy Council  could have no legal voice in such a case except that of ad∣vising the assent or dissent of the Sove∣reign and yet whenever it was neces∣sary to call  a distinct  Irish Parliament in England it is not improbable but that they might be summoned to meet the  King in his Privy Council  by way of dis∣tinguishing their separate Assembly from the jointmeeting of the English and Irish Parliaments beforementioned And that such  distinct Irish Parliaments  have sometimes been held  in England  ap∣pears by a record cited by Mr Molly∣neux  There have been other Statutes or Ordinan∣ces made in England for Ireland which may  rea∣sonably  be of force here because they were made and  assented to by our own Representatives  Thus we find in the White Book of the Exchequer in Dublin in the th Year of Edward the First a writ sent to his Chancellor of Ireland wherein he men∣tions  Quaedam Statuta per nos de Assensa Prelatorum Comitum Baronum Communitates Regni nostri Hibex∣niae  per upud Lincoln quaedam alia Statuta post∣modum papud Eborum facta  These we may suppose were either Statutes made at the request of the States of Ireland to explain to them the Common Law of England or if they were introductive of new laws yet they might well be of force in Ireland being enacted by the assent of our own Representatives the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons of Ireland as the words aforementioned do shew and indeed these are instances so far from making against our claim that I think nothing can be more plainly for us for it manifestly shews that the King and Parliament of England would not enact laws to bind Ireland without the concurrence of the Representatives of this Kingdom  wherein mention is made of  Statutes made at  Lincoln  and at  York  in the th of Edw I by the  express assent of the Irish Parliament in all its branches of Legislature  viz per nos de assensu Pre∣latorum Comitorum et Communitates  Regni nostri Hibernioe  without the least mention of  the English Parliament  Thus it appears probable that the Irish have been  represented  in England as  well in  separate  as in  joint  Parliaments and upon such equitable terms of Repre∣sentation  in England  I presume no Irish Patriot will object to the  binding  of  English  Statutes  "Add hereunto" says Sir William Petty in his Political Survey of Ireland p  that if both Kingdoms were  under one Legislative Power and Parliament the Members whereof should be pro∣portionable in power and wealth of each Nation  there would be no danger such a Parliament should do any thing to the prejudice of the  English  interest in  Ire∣land  nor could the  Irish  ever complain of partiality when they shall be  freely and proportionably represented  in all Legislatures  The same author has also made a very striking remark in p concerning the neces∣sity of maintaining the independence of the  Legislative Power  whether we apply the same to  Ireland  or to any other part of the  British  Empire for  why should men  says he  endeavour to get estates where  the Legislative Power  is not agreed upon and where tricks and words destroy  natural Rights  and Pro∣perty  whether Ireland be "  especially named  " or not because the just reason of objection before cited from the Judges in the th of Henry VI and d Richard III no longer sub∣sists when a due Representation is al∣lowed  How much  later  than the Reign of Edw III this practice was continued of  occasionally  summoning the Irish Par∣liament  into England  does not appear though we may be certain that it did not continue so late as the Reign of Hen VI because the great Fortescue and the other Judges his cotemporaries could not have declared as has already been shewn that  a tenth or fifteenth granted  here  should  not bind  those of Ireland  if the practice of sending  Representatives from thence  had continued to that time nevertheless the proofs already produ∣ced are amply sufficient to confute the observation of Judge Jenkins in his th Century p  viz  that  the Sta∣tutes of England which  expressly  name  Ireland bind them and their Lands and Goods  As the Statute of York  says he  made th E II and the th E I de Mercatoribus and others  For as I have produced sufficient exam∣ples  of the Irish Parliament being sum∣moned to England in  both the Reigns  which he has mentioned these Statutes cited by him can afford no testimony of what he supposes because the Irish might probably have been  represented in those very  Parliaments for which opi∣nion I have already shewn there is  some evidence  and I am not apprehensive that  any evidence at all  can be produced to the contrary  The same reply holds good also against the most material examples cited in Serjeant Mayart's answer to Sir Rich∣ard Bolton's Declaration  The learned Editor of these two Tracts Mr Harris who has published them in his Hibernica printed at Dublin in supposes that  Sir Rich∣ard Bolton  was  not  the author of this Declaration and informs us in his Preface that he is  inclined ra∣ther to give the honour of the performance to Patrick Darcey  Esq  an eminent Lawyer and an active Member of the House of Commons in the Parlia∣ment assembled at Dublin in  who was the au∣thor  of a similar argument delivered by him at a con∣ference with a Committee of the Irish Lords in printed in "The conformity" says Mr Harris  between what is alledged in the Declara∣tion and in Darcy's Arguments inclines me to think him the author of that paper  But a conformity in substance between two authors upon one and the same  national  question is very far from affording so substan∣tied a proof of the real author as the name of  Sir Rich∣ard Bolton  upon one of the manuscripts Probably the impeachment of Sir Richard Bolton in the same year of HighTreason for betraying in his capacity of Chancellor of Ireland the Constitution of that coun∣try  Viz For having  traiterously contrived introduced and ex∣ercised an arbitrary and tyrannical Government against Law throughout this Kingdom Ireland by the countenance and as∣sis  e of  Thomas  Earl of  Strafford  then Christ Governor of this Kingdom  See the st Article of Impeachment against Sir Rich∣ard Bolton and others with the Speech of Mr Audley Mervi  on that occasion taken from Nalsop's Collection of Papers and ra∣printed at Dublin in at the end of Darcy's Argument  might be another reason for Mr Harris's sup∣position but this very contrary behaviour with which Sir Richard Bolton was charged does not appear to have been so much the effect of his private opinion as of him political  timeserving  or yielding with his bre∣thren in Administration to the arbitrary notions of Lord Strafford the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland or perhaps the dangerous increasing power of the papists at that time might occasion his thus yielding to mea∣sures  which were so diametrically opposite to his own just principles though indeed no danger whatever can justify such conduct since "honesty is always" most certainly "the best policy" Nevertheless not on∣ly Serjeant Mayart's answer acknowledges Sir Richard as the author of the Declaration but Mr Mollyneux in p and cites a marginal note of Sir Rich∣ard's when he was Lord Chief Baron of the Exche∣quer in Ireland which he had affixed in his Edition of the Irish Statutes Stat Henry VII c to the following purport  resembling  the substance of the Declaration attributed to Sir Rich Bolton  much more  than the argument of Mr Darcy  viz  That in the th of Edward the Second by Parliament in this Realm of Ireland the Statutes of Merton made the th of Henry the Second  and the Statutes of  Mal∣bridge  made the d of  Henry  the Third the Statute of  Westminster  the first made the d of  Edward  the First the Statute of  Gloucester  made the th of  Ed∣ward  the First and the Statute of  Westminster  the se∣cond made the th of  Edward  the First were all con∣firmed  in this Kingdom Ireland  and all other Sta∣tutes which were of force in  England  were referred to be examined in the next Parliament and so many as were then allowed and published to stand likewise for Laws in this Kingdom And in the th of  Henry  the Fourth it was enacted in this Kingdom of  Ireland That the Statutes made in  England  should not be of force in this Kingdom unless they were allowed and pub∣lished in this Kingdom by Parliament  And the like  Statute was made again in the th of  Henry  the Sixth These Statutes are not to be found in the  Rolls nor any Parliament  Roll of that time but he  Sir Richard Bolton  had seen the same exemplified under the great Seal and the  exemplification  remaineth in the Treasury of the  city of Waterford  Mollyneux's Case of Ire∣land pp  setting  forth  how and by what means the Laws and Statutes  of England  from  time to time came to be of force  in Ireland  and it is undeniable that  the  Irish  Parliament have in general thought it necessary to examine and to authenticate by the  express assent  of their own assemblies such  English  Statutes as they judged proper to be admitted as Law within their own Island of which Sir Richard Bolton has produced a great variety of examples  But such Statutes as have been made in England since the th of King John  and are intro∣ductory and positive making new Laws or any ways altering adding unto or diminishing the ancient Com∣mon Laws  have not been binding or any ways of force in Ireland until such time as they have been enacted allowed and approved of by Act of Par∣liament in Ireland as may appear by the judge∣ments of nine Parliaments holden  there  viz  in the th of Edward  II in a Parliament in Ireland the Statutes of Merton and Marlebridge made in the time of Henry III and the Statutes of Westminster st and of Westminster d and the Statute of Gloucester made in the time of Edward I were  confirmed and approved to be of force in Ireland and all other Statutes which were of force in Eng∣land were then referred to be examined  in the next Parliament and so many of them as should be then al∣lowed and published to be accepted for Laws in Ireland  And afterwards in a Parliament holden in Ireland in th of Edward II it was enacted that  the Sta∣tutes made in England should not be of force in the King∣dom of Ireland unless they were allowed and published in that Kingdom by Parliament  and the like Statute  was made again in th of Henry  VIBut these Sta∣tutes are not to be found in these parliament rolls nor any parliament rolls at that time but the  same are exemplified under the great Seal and the exemplifications were remaining in the Treasury of the city of Waterford  And it is most certain that not only these parlia∣ment rolls but also many other rolls and records miscarried in those troublesome and distempered times which have been in Ireland For in all the times of Edw IIIRich IIHen IVand Hen V which is almost an hundred years there is not any parliament roll to be found and yet it is most certain that divers Parliaments were holden in those times Moreover in th of Edw Ith of Edw IIIth of Edw IIIth of Edw III th of Edw IIIand th of Rich II divers good laws were made in England by several Acts of Parliament against the extortions and oppressions of Purveyors which laws were never received nor put into execution in Ireland untill the th of  Hen VI chap that it was enacted agreed and established by Parliament in Ireland that all Sta∣tutes made against Purveyors within the Realm of England should be holden and kept in all points and put in execution in Ireland Afterwards in the time of Edward IV a doubt was conceived whether the Statute made in England in th of Rich II chap concerning Rape ought to be of force in Ireland without a confirmation thereof by Par∣liament for the clearing of which ambiguity and doubt in th Edward IV chap in Ireland it was enacted by authority of Parliament that  the said Statute of th of Richard  II  be adjudged and proved in force and strength  and that the Statute may be of force in this land of Ireland from the th day of March then last past and from thenceforth the said Act and all other Statutes and Acts made by the au∣thority of the said Parliament within the Realm of England be ratified and confirmed and adjudged by the authority of Parliament in their  force and strength from the said th Day of March"So as until the said Statute  of th Edw IVthe said Statute of th Rich II was not wholly of force in Ireland and that may appear by the words of the said Statute of the th of Edward IVFor by the words thereof the said Statute of th Rich II was to be of force  from the th of March then last past  whereas the said Statute of th  Rich  II  had been but a declaration or explanation of the Stature of Westmin∣ster chap  it would have  been of force at all times  since the making  of the Statute of Westminster d which was in th Edw IBut afterwards th Hen VII c it was enacted in a Parliament in Ireland  this is one of the Acts commonly called Poining's Acts  that all Statutes then lately made within the said  Realm of England concerning or belong∣ing to the common or public weale of the same from thence∣forth  should be deemed good and effectual in the law and over that accepted used and executed within the land of Ireland at all times requisite ac∣cording  to the tenor and effect of the same and over that by the authority aforesaid that they and every of them be authorised proved and confirmed in the said land of Ireland  By all which Statutes made from time to time in Ireland it plainly appeareth  that all Statutes made in England before th Hen  VII  concerning or belonging to the public and commonwealth of England  are made to be of force  and to become laws in Ireland  In st Hen VIII chap an Act was made in Eng∣land that makes it felony in a servant that runneth away with the goods of his master or mistress and this Act was not received in Ireland until  the same was enacted by a Parliament holden in Ireland  in d Hen VIII Sess chap In st Hen VIII chap There was a law made in England that all Lords might distrain upon the lands of them holden for their rents and services and to make their avowries not naming the tenant but upon the  lands but this law was not received in Ireland un∣til it was enacted there in d Hen VIII Sess chap An Act was made in England in Anno Hen VIII chap that joint tenants and te∣nants in common should be compelled to make par∣tition which Act was not received in Ireland until it was enacted there in d Hen VIII Sess chap In th Hen VIII chap the Statute of Uses was made in England for transferring of Uses into possession which Statute was never received nor of force in Ireland till the same was enacted in Ireland th Car chap So likewise d Hen VIII chap a Statute was enacted in Eng∣land whereby it is directed how lands and tene∣ments may be disposed by will and concerning ward∣ship and primer seizins which Statute was never received nor of force in Ireland until it was en∣acted by parliament in Ireland in th Car I chap In Anno st Eliz chap there was an Act made in England for the uniformity of the Com∣monPrayer and Administration of the Sacraments which Act was not received in Ireland until the same was confirmed and established by Parliament in Anno d Eliz c In Anno th Eliz c there was an Act of Parliament made in England for the punish∣ment of wilful perjury which Act was not of force in Ireland until the same was enacted by a Parlia∣ment in Ireland in th Eliz chap Another Act was made in England in Anno d Eliz chap  for the punishment of witchcraft and sorcery and another Act in the same year chap for the pu∣nishment of forgery which Acts were not of force in Ireland until the same were enacted by Parlia∣ment there in th Eliz chap In th Hen VIII chap there was an Act made in England for the punishment of piracy which Act was not of force in Ireland until the same was en∣acted in Ireland in th of James chap In th of Eliz chap an Act was made in Eng∣land against fraudulent conveyances which Act was not of force nor received in Ireland until the same was enacted in Ireland th Car I chap Besides many other Acts made in the several reigns of Henry VIIIEdward VIQueen Elizabeth King Jamesand the King's Majesty who now is In th Hen VIII chap c an Act was made in England concerning appeals made to Rome which Act doth  by express words extend to all his Majesty's dominions  yet the same  was not received  nor of force  in Ireland  until it was enacted by Act of Parliament  there  in th Hen VIII chap Also the Statute of th Hen VIII chap made in England concerning the firstfruits of the Clergy extended by express words to any of the King's dominions yet the same was not received or of force in Ireland until it was enacted there by Parliament in th Hen VIII chap Likewise  the Act of faculties made in England th Hen VIII chap extended  by express words to all the King's dominions  yet the same  was not re∣ceived  or of force  in Ireland  until it was enacted by Parliament in Ireland th Henry VIII chap  some  general  and some  particular  made at different periods of time from the th of Ed∣ward  II to the Reign of King Charles I the time when he wrote and of these  examples not less in number than eighteen which surely are sufficient to prove the  uniform sense of the  Irish  Parliament upon this point in every age since they received the  English  Law  Of the general examples which he has cited that in the th of Hen VII one of Poining's Acts whereby all the  English Statutes then in force were adopted by the Irish is the most re∣markable and it is necessary to take par∣ticular notice of this Act because the ef∣fect of it is frequently misunderstood for some have supposed that hereby  all the Statutes made in the Parliament of England concerning the public should be observed in Ireland  without obser∣ving any farther distinction  In this indiscriminate manner Monsieur Ra∣pin has expressed himself and has thereby given a wrong Idea of the Irish Legislature to such of his rea∣ders as do not care for the trouble of secking better in∣formation for in speaking of the two Statutes com∣monly called  Poining's Acts  after having mentioned that Act relating to the King's permission for assembling the Parliament he adds  Un autre portoit que tous les Actes faits dans le Parliament d'Angleterre con∣cernant le Public seroient observez on Irlande Ces deux Statuts font encore en force aujourdui  Tome p  as if  they thought the Statute capable of in∣cluding not only all the English Acts then made but likewise all such as should be ordained in future and if this had really been the case it would have been in vain to have contended for the Liberties of Ireland but the Act itself is not capable of such a  construction  not∣withstanding that some have thought it doubtfully worded The tenor of it is recited by Lord Coke in his th instit p as follows  That all Statutes  late  made within the Realm of  England  concerning or belonging to the com∣mon or public weal of the same from henceforth be deemed good and effec∣tual in the Law and over that be ac∣cepted used and executed within this land of  Ireland  in all points  c  And though the word  late  was afterwards deemed a doubtful expression with re∣spect to the extent of its effect yet it suf∣ficiently restrains the Act to the introduc∣tion  of such  English  Statutes  only  as were of prior date which effect is confirmed also by a resolution of the Judges in the th of James cited by Lord Coke in the same page  And Hil Jacobi Regis it was resol∣ved by the two Chief Justices and Chief Baron that this word  late  in the beginning of this act had the sense of  before  so that this Act extended to  Magna Carta  and to  all  Acts of Parliament made in England  before  this Act of H But it is to be observed that such Acts of Parliament as have been made in England since H wherein Ire∣land is not particularly named or generally included extend not thereunto for that albeit it be govern∣ed by the same law yet is it  a distinct Realm  or  Kingdome  and as hath been said  hath Parliaments there  Inst p  and he has like∣wise stated the true effect of that Act in his ist Institute  b Viz  By an Act of Parliament called  Poining's Law  holden in Ireland  says he  in the th yeare of Hen∣ry the th it is enacted That all Sta∣tutes made in this Realme of  Eng∣land  BEFORE THAT TIME should be  of force and be put in use within the Realme of  Ireland  c  This Act of Poining's therefore suffi∣ciently proves what Sir Richard Bolton intended by citing it  viz  that the  Irish  did not esteem the  English  Laws  binding in that Kingdom  until allowed by the Au∣thority of their own Parliament other∣wise the Act itself had been nugatory as also the other Irish Acts which he has cited for the same purpose in some of which it seems the Parliament itself expressly asserted the Doctrine for which he contends as in that of the th of Edw II wherein it was enacted  That the Statutes made in  England  SHOULD NOT BE OF FORCE in the Kingdom of  Ireland  unless they were allowed and published in that Kingdom by Parlia∣ment  See Sir Richard Bolton's Declarations  c  in Harris's Hibernica p  Sir Richard Bolton also  informs us that  a like Statute was made again in the th of Henry VI  and therefore notwithstanding that Ser∣jeant Mayart has taken great pains and filled many pages with citations of prece∣dents from old Records of Law Cases Writs  c  in order to prove that  Eng∣lish  Acts of Parliament have been re∣ferred to and allowed in judicial Pro∣ceedings before the same were con∣firmed in  Ireland  yet all his labour has been bestowed in vain for besides that he ought first to have proved the Acts in question to have been made by the  English  Parliament alone without any such representation of the  Irish  Parlia∣ment jointly therewith as I have already shewn to have been frequently practised in those early days let it be also remark∣ed that though we should allow that the  Irish  Courts of Justice might per∣haps in some particular cases of  diffe∣rence  between individuals but of  indiffe∣rence  to the general Liberties of  Ireland  have followed the directions of some mere  English  Acts of Parliament as esteeming them wholesome regulations of Justice proper to be adopted for the determination of the Cases before them yet the  Confir∣mation  of such Acts afterwards at diffe∣rent periods clearly proves the irregulari∣ty of such premature proceedings in the Courts and that the highest Court of that Kingdom the Court of Parliament did not esteem the  English  Acts  of suffi∣cient legal Authority  till confirmed by themselves for otherwise the  Confir∣mation  would have been  unnecessary  since the Acts if Serjeant Mayart's examples are admitted were already re∣ceived into use and therefore all such CourtPrecedents as are cited by the learned Serjeant are clearly Precedents of  Irregularities  and not of  Law  so that they are not intitled to any considera∣tion at all especially as the Irish Legisla∣ture  itself which has certainly a better right to determine what shall be esteemed Law in Ireland than any of the inferior Courts has positively declared by the express Acts of the th of Edward II and the th of Henry VI before cited that  English  Statutes shall not be of force in  Ireland  unless allowed by the  Irish  Parliament And agreeable to this is the Declaration of the Irish House of Com∣mons in Article the first That  the Subjects of this his Majesty's King∣dom of Ireland are a free people and to be governed only according to the  common Law  of  England  and Statutes made and established by Parliament in this Kingdome of  Ireland  and ac∣cording to the lawful Customes used in the same  p  Now though the Conviction by these weighty Authorities will probably destroy the credit of Serjeant Mayart as a wri∣ter  in the opinion of every honest Irish∣man yet the Irish are more obliged to this Author than he himself perhaps intended they should be for he clearly proves that  a Charter of Liberties  For the only mistake of  Lord Coke  is that he conceived  says he  that  Magna Charta  was not of force in  Ireland  'till the th of Hen which is only a mistake of a matter of fact for  in truth we find  continues the Serjeant  that sta∣tute was given to them of Ireland in the first year of Hen and all the Chapters thereof except three or four of the last Chapters are entered in the Red Book of the Exchequer of Ireland where in the beginning after the King's stile recited he saith Imprimis concessimus Deo et hac praesenti Chartâ nostrâ confirmamus pro nobis haeredibus nostris in perpetuum quod Hibernica Ecclesia libera sit  c  First we have granted to God and by this our Charter confirm for us and our heirs for ever that the Church of Ireland be frec Sir John Davis cites a Record in the Tower st of Hen Memb  of the like Charter of Liberties granted  by Hen  to his Subjects in Ireland as him∣self and his Father had granted to the Subjects of Eng∣land  but yet this mistake is only for that Coke was not  informed of that matter of fact  Harris's Hiber∣nica pp  agreeing in all the Chapters with our  Magna Charta  was  separately granted to  the King's Subjects of Ireland  without distinction in the first year of King Hen∣ry III so that  all the Subjects of Ireland  the conquered Irish not excepted from that very early period and even soon∣er  For the  English Settlers  carried their Rights with them and the native Irish  gladly accepted  the  Eng∣lish  Common Law as soon as it was tendered to them by the  English  Conquerors of which I have produced ample testimony in a Note on page so that their just title to  English Liberty  and all the legal Immunities of the Conquerors was clearly established and confirmed by  this Irish Magna Charta  They were very soon afterwards indeed wickedly excluded from these equi∣table Privileges by the inconsiderate English Settlers many of whom for the sake of tyrannizing over their poor neighbours even  degenerated  as Sir John Davies informs us in p into the lawless Irish manners themselves adopting the old  Irish  oppressions of Ta∣nistry Cosherings Cuttings Sessings Coigne and Livery  c  under which most wicked  These  most wicked oppressions  originally sp  ang from the undue Power and unlimited Sway of the antient Irish Chieftaine or Lords over their poor brethren but I must refer my Readers for a particu∣lar description of them to Sir John Davies who has emply set forth the grosa injustice and pernicious effects of such  unlimited power  in men nevertheless I am tempted to cite by way of sample what he has men  ioned in on  place concerning the wickedness of  Coigne  and  Livery  in particular for in shewing the ill effects of English Dege∣neracy he remarks in p "By this" says he  it appeareth why the extortion of  Coigne  and  Livery  is called in the old Statutes of Ireland A DAMNABLE CUSTOME and the imposing and taking thereof made  HighTreason  And it is said in an antient Discourse  says he  of the Decay of Ireland  that though it were first invent∣ed in  Hell  yet if it had been used and practised there as it hath been in Ireland it had long since destroyed the very Kingdom of Beelzebub  The same bad effects are produced in some degree by every kind of  Vassalage  so that the bad Policy of establishing  Seigneuries  in Canada or eltewhere is but too apparent  pretences they  devoured the  poor Natives  as well as the poorer sort of  English  Settlers and thereby occasioned almost conti∣nual Wars for several ages which in the end turned out to their own great peril and disadvantage accord∣ing to the neverfailing maxim or rather warning of the Apostle Paul  If ye bite and devour one another  take heed that ye be not  consumed one of another  Gal v  But though the  Irish  were by this wretched Policy of the  English  long deprived of the  Benefit  of the  English  Common Law yet this by no means deprived them of their just  Right  or  Claim  to it which must necessarily be acknowledged to have been due from the time that the English first settled in that Country  were as much entitled to  English  Liberty and all the Immunities and Be∣nefits of the  English  Common Law as the Inhabitants of England themselves and yet Lord Coke himself it seems  d Inst p  was not aware of this Circumstance but  "Conceived" says Serjeant Mayart p  that  Magna Charta  was not of force  in Ireland  till the th of Hen which is only a mistake  says he  of a matter of fact for  in truth we find  says he  that Statute was given to them of Ireland in the first year of Hen  c  But though this was only  "a mistake of a matter of fact"  yet it was such a mistake as might pro∣bably in great measure have occasioned the erroneous opinions ever after of that great and worthy man concerning the Constitution of Ireland  But Serjeant Mayart has not profited so much as might have been expected by this knowledge that the Subjects of  Ire∣land  were honoured with a distinct Char∣ter for after pointing out in page the several Chapters of the Charter wherein as he supposes  that Law dif∣fers from the antient common Law  he adds them triumphantly to his Collec∣tion of Precedents for binding  Ireland  by Statutes made in  England  as if  a Charter of Liberties  freely given and gladly accepted could afford any Evi∣dence  against Liberty  For this undis∣tinguishing man did not consider that the King by this Charter of Liberties  binds and restrains  himself rather than his Peo∣ple in all the most dangerous points of Prerogative wherein the Rulers of other Countries are left too much  unlimited  and therefore that the Subjects of  Ireland  might accept the same which they most willingly did without the least Deroga∣tion from their just and natural Rights  And as this Charter was granted to the  "King's Subjects in Ireland"  with∣out distinction it affords the most am∣ple proof that even the  conquered Irish  were entitled to all the Immunities Pro∣tection and Benefits which the  English  Conquerors themselves  enjoyed by it for even Serjeant Mayart himself proves in p that the English Laws  were given at first    tam  ANGLIS QUAM HIBERNICIS  as well to  ENG∣LISH AS IRISH  Serjeant Mayart also informs us  That the whole Realm of Ireland was antiently reduced into Counties and that the English Laws had passage throughout the same as appears" says he "by several PipeRolls of the Time of Hen in the Exchequer of Ireland where there are accounts  says he  made for fines paid by the mere  Irish  for  Dis∣seisins  and many other kinds of Trespasses com∣mitted by them in those places which the Author calls  Irish  Territories though some of the Irish with their posterity after them being always  averse  to the English Laws could not digest them but hid themselves in the bogs mountains  c  But this aversion of  "some of the Irish"  to the English Laws is easily accounted for since it appears very clearly from Sir John Davies's Book that the Irishry had much more experience and woful knowledge of  English Op∣pression  than of the  English Laws  for when any of them wore driven from their Lands and Possessions through the avarice and by the unlawful power of the great English Lords who found their interest in treat∣ing them as enemies it was very  natural  for them to at∣tempt to  disseize  and recover their former Rights and Possessions and again when they found no Protection from the English Laws nor other exertion thereof than that of  sining  and  punishing  them for such  "Disseizins" c  which were mere  Reentries  it was  equally natural  for them to imbibe prejudices against the English Laws and to fly to their Bogs  c  Thus the  English Oppres∣sions  were apparently the cause why  some  of the Irish were averse to the  English Laws  which I have express∣ed more at large in a Note on p  The Irish Na∣tion  are also obliged to Serjeant Mayart for some other Proofs in their favour  which he intended against them  for a∣mongst his Precedents of  giving Law  he informs us in p  that in the Reign of King Henry II  the common Law  and  lawful  Customs of  England  were received planted and establish∣ed in this his Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland  a Point which every Irish Patriot is zealous to maintain And he has favoured us in page with an∣other notable Example of binding the  Irish  by  English  Laws this it seems was in the Reign of King John  of whom  says he triumphantly  in  that respect it may be well said that  Statuit et praecepit Leges  he  appointed and established the Laws  as also because he put them in writing and left them in his Court of Exchequer for their better directions  but he happily in∣forms us at the same time which spoils his own application of the Precedent that all this was done  "at the instance"  says he  of the Irish  as the Record saith or of the English who account∣ed themselves Irish  c  And there∣fore as these English Laws and Customs are clearly acknowledged by himself to have been introduced  at the instance of the Irish  it must manifestly appear that this antient example excludes the Doctrine which he meant to support by it in opposition to Sir Richard Bolton and therefore if all these points are duly considered I think we may very fairly retort his own words which he exulting∣ly applied to Sir Richard Bolton upon  himself  viz  Whereupon it must needs also follow that the Author's Discourse  FALLS ALL IN PIECES  and is nothing  to the purpose that he would have it  Serjeant Mayart has also taken a great deal of needless pains to prove  Ireland  to be annexed to  the Crown of England  and that  the King and Parliament of England have Power over Ireland  and he cites several Acts of Parliament and other Authorities in pages and of his  Answer  in the  Hibernica  which clearly prove indeed the  former part of the Assertion  that Ireland is annexed to the Crown of England a point which the Irish themselves are so far from deny∣ing that they are rather desirous to main∣tain it  Case of Ireland p  It has ever been ac∣knowledged that the Kingdom of Ireland is inseparably annexed to the Imperial Crown of England  The obli∣gation that our Legislature lies under by Poining's  Act Hen VII c makes this  Tye between the two Kingdoms  indissoluble And we must ever own it our happiness to be thus annexed to England and that the Kings and Queens of England are by undoubted Right  ipso facto  Kings and Queens of Ireland And from hence we may reasonably con∣clude that if any Acts of Parliament made in England should be of force in Ireland before they are received there in Parliament they should be more especially such Acts as relate to the  Succession  and  Settlement of the Crown  and  Recognition  of the King's Title thereto and the  Power  and  Juris∣diction  of the King And yet we find in the  Irish  Statutes Hen VIII c  an Act for the Succes∣sion of the King and Queen Anne  and another chap declaring the King to be  supreme Head of the Church of Ireland  both which Acts had formerly passed in the Parliament of England So likewise we find amongst the Irish Statutes  Acts of Recognition of the King's Title to Ireland  in the reigns of Henry VIII Queen Elizabeth King James King Charles II King William and Queen Mary By which it ap∣pears that Ireland though annexed to the Crown of England has always been looked upon to be a  kingdom complete within itself  and to have all Juris∣diction to an absolute Kingdom belonging and subordinate to no legislative authority on Earth Though it is to be noted these English Acts re∣lating  to the succession and recognition of the King's Title do particularly name Ireland  See also page where the same author speaks of  Ireland's being annexed to  and as it were  united with  the imperial Crown of England by several Acts of Parliament both in England and Ireland since King John's time But how far this operates I shall enquire more fully hereafter I shall only at present observe that I conceive little more is effected by these statutes than that Ireland shall not be  aliened  or  separated  from the King of Eng∣land who cannot hereby dispose of it otherwise than in  legal succession  along with England and that whoever is  King of England  is  ipso fucto King of Ireland  and the subjects of Ireland are obliged to obey him as their liege Lord  But none of his Authorities  afford the least shadow of Evidence for the latter part of his Assertion  viz  the Power of the  English Parliament  over  Ireland  And because Sir Richard Bol∣ton had allowed that such Laws made in  England  as are declaratory of the  CommonLaw  do bind  Ireland  without any confirmation there see  Hibernica  p  c  Serjeant Mayart hopes to avail himself of the circumstance and observes thereupon  It must necessarily follow  says he p  that the Parliament of  England  hath still an in∣fluence upon  Ireland  c  And a  little farther he adds  But if it should happen  says he  that the Parlia∣ment of  England  should make an ex∣position of a Law in force in  Ireland  and the Parliament there should make another and that it may be different or contrary to that of  England  certainly  says he  Ireland  must be bound by the Author's own Rule  meaning Sir Richard Bolton  by the declaratory Statute of the Parliament of  Eng∣land  But Sir Richard Bolton's Rule includes no such Doctrine For there is nothing unreasonable in supposing that the Irish subjects without prejudice to their natu∣ral Rights and the Privileges of their own Parliament might receive  the declara∣tory Statute of the Parliament of Eng∣land  as the best Exposition of the CommonLaw which they  before acknow∣ledged  and  freely accepted  by  their own express assent and desire  Sir Edward Coke himself bears ample testi∣mony to this "Our student must know" says he  that King John in the th year of his reign went into Ireland and there by the advice of grave and learned men in the Lawes whom he car∣ried with him BY PARLIAMENT DE COMMUNI OMNIUM DE HYBERNIA CONSENSU ordained and established that  Ireland  should be governed by  the Laws of England  which of many of the  Irishmen  for the  common consent  before mentioned must mean that of the  English  settlers  according to their own desire was joyfully accepted and obeyed  and of many the same was soon after absolutely refused preferring their  Brehen  Law before the just and honourable Lawes of England  st Inst p  But this subsequent refusal and preference given to the  Brehen Law  must not be charged to the  native Irish  in general for Sir John Davis in his  Dis∣coverie of the true causes why Ireland was never en∣tirely subdued  c  demonstrates that the  Eng∣lish Settlers  were  principally  to be blamed for this He shews p that  the scopes of land which were graunted to the first adventurers  were too large  and the  Liberties  and  Royalties  which they obtained therein  were too great for subjects  And in p  that these  Grants  of whole provinces and petty kingdoms those few English Lordes pre∣tended to be proprietors of all the land so that there was no possibility left of  settling the natives in  their possessions  and by consequence the conquest became impossible without the  utter extirpation of all the Irish  which these English Lordes were not able to doe nor perhaps  willing  if they had been able  This he afterwards explains shewing that false notions of private interest among the  English  Lords prevented both the conquest and the introduc∣tion of the English Law They  hoped to become Lords of those lands which were possessed by the Irish whereunto they  pretended title by their large Grants  c  p  and that therefore  they per∣suaded the King of England p that it was  unfit to communicate the Lawes of England unto them  that it was the best policie to holde them as aliens and enemies and to prosecute them  with a continual warre  Hereby they obtained  says he  ano∣ther royal Prerogative and power which was to  make Warre and Peace at their pleasure  in every part of the kingdom which gave them an absolute com∣mand over the bodies lands and goods  even  of the  English  Subjectes heere  meaning in Ire∣land where he wrote And he adds in the same page "And besides" says he  the  Irish  inhabit∣ing the lauds fully conquered and reduced being in  condition of slaves  and villaines did  render a greater profit and revennew  than if they had been made  the King's free subjects  They also feared  as he de∣clares in the preceding page  that if the Irish were  received into the King's protection and made liege∣men and freesubjectes  the State of England  woulde  establish them  or rather reestablish them  in their possessions  by Graunts from the Crown  c  And "The  troth is  " says he in p  that those great English Lords did to the uttermost of their power crosse and withstand the enfranchise∣ment of the Irish for the causes before expressed  And he rightly lays  the fault upon the pride covetousness and illcounsell of the  English  planted heer  which in all former ages  says he  have bin the chief impediments of the final conquest of Ireland  On the other hand he clearly exculpates the  native Irish  from the charge of  wilfully  refusing to be subject to the Laws of England "But perhaps" says he in p  the  Irishry  in former times did wilfully refuse to be subject to the Lawes of England and would not be partakers of the benefit thereof though the  Crown of England  did desire it and therefore they were reputed Aliens Outlawes and Enemies ASSUREDLY THE CONTRARIE DOTH APPEARE as wel by the Charters of Denization purchased by the Irish IN ALL AGES as by a petition preferred by them to the King anno Ed III desiring that an Act  might passe in Ireland  whereby ALL THE IRISHRIE might be inabled to use and injoy the  Lawes of England  without purchasing of  particular Denizations  And in p he adds  I am well assured that  the Irishrie  DID DESIRE  to be  admitted to the benefit of the Law not only in this petition exhibi∣ted to King Edw III but  by all their submissions  made to King Richard II and to the Lord Thomas of Lancaster before the warres of the two Houses and afterwards to the Lord Leonard Gray and Sir An∣thony St Leger when K Henry VIII began to reform this kingdom In particular the Birnes of of the Mountaines in the th of Hen VIII de∣sire that their countrey might be made Shire ground and called the County of Wicklow And in the d of Hen VIII O Donnel doth covenant with Sir William Skeffington  Quod si Dominus Rex velit reformare Hiberniam  whereof it should seem he made some doubt  that  hee and his people would  GLADLY  bee governed by the Lawes of England  These quotations sufficiently demonstrate the  wil∣lingness  of the native  Irish  to adopt the  English  Laws and Constitution and that the denial of such a reason∣able desire was the just cause of their almost continual rebellions and bloody wars against the  English  Settlers However in the reign of King James I  the Irishry  were restored to their just Rights  and the benefit and protection of the Law of England communica∣ted TO ALL AS WELL IRISH AS ENGLISH WITH∣OUT DISTINCTION OR RESPECT OF PERSONS  c  p  And Sir John Davies himself was one of the judges employed in that most grateful business  to a benevolent man I mean the  Visitations of Jus∣tice whereby the just and  HONOURABLE LAW OF ENGLAND was imparted and communicated to  all the Irishry  P  And he informs us in the same page that  the common people  were taught by the Justices of Assise that  they were  FREE SUB∣JECTS  to the Kings of England  and not Slaves and Vassals to their pretended Lords That the  Cut∣tings Cosheries Sessings  and other extortions of their Lords were UNLAWFUL and that they should not any more submit themselves thereunto since they were now under the protection of so just and mighty a Prince as both would and could protect them from al' wrongs and oppressions They gave  says he  A WILLING EAR unto these lessons and thereupon the greatnesse and power of those Irish Lords over the people sodainly fell and vanished when their oppressions and extortions were taken away which did maintain their greatness  c  In p he informs us that Sir Edmund Pelham and himself were  the first Justices of Assise that ever sat in those countries  speaking particularly of Ty∣rone and Tirconnell "and in that circuit" says he  we visited all the shires of that province be∣sides which visitation though it were somewhat distastfull to the Irish Lords  was sweet and most welcome to the common people  who albeit they were rude and barbarous yet did they  quickly apprehend the difference  betweene the tiranny and oppression  under which they lived before and  the just govern∣ment  and protection which we promised unto them for the time to come  Thus the common people of  the Irishry  were at length restored to that equality in the eye of the law to which they were justly entitled though shamefully deprived of it from the earliest time that the English began to be known in that kingdom even from the first establishment of the English Conquerors for Sir John Davies shews from Matthew Paris's History that  King Henry II  before his return out of Ire∣land  held a Counsell or Parliament at  Lissemore  where the Laws of England were  by all willingly received  ubi leges Angliae AB OMNIBUS  sunt gra∣tanter receptae  et juratoria cautione praestita confir∣matae  p  And he informs us in the next page that  King Henrie the Third did graunt and transmit the  like Charter of Liberties to his subjects of Ireland  as himself and his Father had graunted to  the Subjects of England  as appeareth  says he  by another Record in the Tower Hen III Pat  m  And he cites also a writ of the th year of the same King commanding the Lord Justice of Ireland to cause  the Charter of King John  to be read and confirmed by Parliament and again that  the same King by Letters Patent under the GreatSeal of England  did confirme the establishment  of the  Eng∣lish Laws  made by King John  and that all Writs of  the Common Law  should have course there as in Eng∣land    Quod  OMNIA BREVIA  de  COMMUNI JURE  quae currunt in Anglia similiter currant in Hibernia  c Thus it appears that all  Irish  Subjects without distinction are entitled according to the clearest and most unquestionable testimony to all the Rights Immunities and Advantages of  Magna Charta  and the  English  Common Law  But let us suppose that in some such declaratory Act they had reason to think  the English Exposition improper and should therefore choose to confirm their  own sense  of it by the Authority of their  own Parliament  surely the latter would  be binding in Ireland and  not the English Statute  as Serjeant Mayart supposes  for there is no example of an  Irish  Act of Parliament being set aside by the Autho∣rity  of the  English  Parliament which Serjeant Mayart allows  Neither is it to be imagined" says he in p that the Kings and Parliaments in Eng∣land will ever  avoid any Laws made in Ireland  without a good and just cause  since they have not done any such things for about four hundred years  which is time enough to have experience of their honour and justice  c  And he afterwards uses this plea con∣cerning the Honour and Justice of the English Parliament as an inducement for the Irish to be bound by it "and seeing" says he in p  that for above years they have never done hurt to Ireland  c  therefore we may  well  trust them  hereafter  c  And again in p "But we all know" says he  with  what great consultation delibera∣tion and knowledge of things and the circumstances of them the Kings and Parliaments of England  have still or∣dered their affairs  c  And we may  says he  as all our ancestors have done  trust to their wisdom justice and judgement  as a  sufficient hedge  and secu∣rity for us  But surely no People who have the use of reason or common∣sense would be induced by  such an argu∣ment  to submit themselves implicitly to a Parliament in which they have no Share of Power or  Representation  though in∣deed it may be alleged in behalf of this writer and his argument that Par∣liaments before his time were  in gene∣ral  less corrupt than they have been since if we except the Parliaments of Richard II and Queen Mary but in these latter times  we all know with  what great consultation deliberation and knowledge of things c c c  If it had been possible for the  Irish  Subjects to have given up to Serjeant Mayart this contested point concerning the necessity of  a due Representation in the Legislature  without giving up at the same time  all due Limitation of Go∣vernment  and consequently  all preten∣sions to their natural Freedom  this advice of his might have been esteemed excu∣sable  But it is  Representation alone  which forms the Basis the superiority and the essential difference of the  English  Con∣stitution of State from all others For in countries where  this is wanting  or where it is become  totally corrupted  it makes but little difference to the bulk of the people whether the executive part of government be in the hands of one of a few or of many  viz  of an  Emperor of a Triumvirate or of a Se∣nate of Nobles or proud Patricians as among the Romans at different periods of time The administration of each of these orders of power respectively is almost equally arbitrary uncertain and dangerous to the community to which the Histories of all monarchical as well as aristocratical Governments I mean those that are merely or too nearly such bear sufficient testimony so that  the Re∣presentation of the people  is the grand point of distinction the fundamental principle whereby the equity and safety of the  English  Government is to be mea∣sured when we compare it with such Governments as either that of France or that of Poland  I have already given some specimens of  French  Government and  French  Law in my Preface it being necessary that  British  Subjects should be well aware of  the Nature and Tendency of that Law which has so lately received the solemn Sanction even of our own Legislature  The late Act for establishing the Laws of  France  in the most extensive Province of the  British  Empire must indeed seem very strange and unna∣tural to the genius of  Englishmen  in general especi∣ally when we consider that even the  French  Inhabi∣tants of that Province themselves are zealous for the  "Privileges of English Subjects"  which plainly ap∣pears by some Expressions in their late Address to the Governor on that occasion and we may therefore rest assured that they are not in general so ignorant and void of commonsense as really to prefer the Laws of  France  to the  equitable  Constitution of  Eng∣land  howsoever they may have been misrepresented We must nevertheless except a few French Seigneurs who having already been allowed  greater exclusive Pri∣vileges  than are consistent with the safety and freedom of their poor neighhours and fellowsubjects would rather wish to promote the  French  Laws and Customs which permit such an unjust Vassalage than the equi∣table Laws of  England  and we may likewise except the Priests and some other absolute Bigots to the Ro∣mish Religion who being entangled in  the Slavery of antichristian Principles  and  "the Doctrines of Devils"  are ready to submit to any  temporal  conditions whatso∣ever for the sake of that  spiritual  or rather  Satanical  Bribe which was wickedly thrown out to them on this occasion I mean the setting up their  adultecated  Re∣ligion as the  established Church of that Province  with a legal Right to collect Tythes  c by national authori∣ty  This was the more unjust and inexcusable because the Romanists had no reason to complain of that Tole∣ration which they so freely enjoyed before In a note on p where I have occasion to mention the de∣fects of some  supposed  Statutes I have added some ex∣amples which naturally occurred thereupon concern∣ing the abominable Tyranny and Wickedness of the  adulterous  Church of  Rome  and these I trust will sufficiently justify the severity of my expressions against that  antichristian  Church See also my  Remarks on several very important Prophecies  part p and part p  as being proper to be renewed and en∣forced in a certain Province of the Bri∣tish Empire And the Hon Mr Jus∣tice Barrington in his Observations on the ancient Statutes has also in just abhorrence of the French Law cited several "Fundamental Maxims"  "Si veut le Roy si veut le Loi" The King's Will is Law Some of the pernicious effects of this detestable maxim I have already shewn in my Preface  of it  upon which the King's Prero∣gative is founded which  as he justly remarks  may not only be mat∣ter of some curiosity to an Englishman  but by comparison may make him thankful for  the noble Constitution to which he is happily born  A Cappa∣docian  says he  may indeed re∣fuse from custom and long usage to exchange a despotic for a more free Government but I can never be per∣suaded  says this benevolent Gentle∣man  but that there is  a necessary con∣nexion between Slavery and Misery  and  between Freedom and Happiness  Se∣neca  says he  nobly inforces the communication of  Liberty to the Sub∣ject  from  the Safety  it procures  to the King  This was the uniform Doctrine of all the an∣tient constitutional Lawyers of England and espe∣cially of the great Chancellor Fortescue whose opi∣nion I have expressly quoted and added some farther observations upon the same point in a Note on page of this  Declaration  Part  Errat si quis existimat tu∣tum esse ibi Regem ubi nihil a Rege tutum est securitas securitate mutuâ paciscenda est  p  Now this  necessary  mutual security  can only be insu∣red by  a free Representation of the People  in the Legislature and therefore the learned Author of this excellent remark will readily allow I trust when he comes to consider these arguments that he himself was not sufficiently upon his guard in another part of his useful work p where he had occasion to mention the  Irish Laws  having there unfortunately adopted the mistaken doc∣trine of Lord Coke about binding the  Subjects of Ireland  by  English  Statutes  "if Ireland is mentioned"  But it is cer∣tainly very natural for a gentleman re∣gularly bred to the profession of the Law to be less circumspect when he follows so great an authority as Sir Edward Coke who is  generally  and for the most part  justly  esteemed the Oracle of the English Law  Mr Barrington is commenting on the Ordinance of Edw I  pro statu Hi∣berniae  and after informing us that it is not found in the Collection of Irish Statutes which begin only with  the Or∣diance of Kilkenny  in the d of Edw II he adds "There can be no doubt" says he  however that this Law extends to Ireland  if not repealed by some Irish Act of Parliament  This Sentence contains an implied acknow∣ledgement that a Law made in  England  relating to the Government of  Ireland  may be  repealed by an Irish Act of Parliament  and if this be allowed which it certainly ought to be there can be no room to sup∣pose the  Irish  Subjects bound by an  English  Act  if Ireland is mentioned  for wherein is the force or  binding  of the  English  Act if the  Irish  are allowed a Right to repeal it Such  binding  amounts to nothing we may as well say that an  English  Act  binds  the Empe∣ror of  Morocco  and his Subjects or the wild  Anabs "when especially named"  since it can  bind  no longer than while they shall be willing to submit to it But that the  Irish  Subjects really have a  Right  to  repeal  an  English Act  relating to their own internal Government if we may with propriety apply the word  repeal  to Acts that were originally defective and void for want of the  Irish  assent is clearly proved by Mr Molly∣neux in his  Case of Ireland  page  as by  Poining's Law  in the time of Henry the Seventh all PRECEDENT  Here the Hon Mr Barrington confirms what is before laid down in pages and concerning the effect of Poining's Law  ENGLISH STATUTES are made to bind in  Ireland  And he remarks thereupon in a note that  subsequent  Statutes only bind  if Ireland is men∣tioned  as for  Wales  continues he all Statutes are now made to extend to it whether  mentioned or not  by a clause inserted in the middle of Geo II cap xlii  c  But the true reason why this doctrine may be applied to  Wales  with propriety and  justice  and yet not to  Ireland  without  injustice  is because the  Welchmen  give their  assent  to the  English  Laws by their Represen∣tatives in the  English  Parliament whereas the  assent  of the  Irish which is equally  essential  cannot be known in a  legal  manner but by the voice of  their own  parliamentary  Representatives  so that the very reason why all  English  Statutes  "extend to Wales whether named or not"  forbids the application of the like Doc∣trine to  Ireland  and as the opinion of the Judges in the th of Hen VI and in the d of Rich III before cited in favour of Ireland was founded on  this very reason    quia non hic habent mili∣tes parliamenti  I hope the same will be thought sufficient to justify my dissent as well from Mr Barrington as from the great Author whom he seems to have followed in this matter I mean Lord Coke himself whose assertion I propose to examine still more closely be∣fore I conclude this d part of my De∣claration  The Hon Mr Justice Barrington also observes in p that  there have  been great and learned controversies between Molyneux and others with regard to an English Act of Parlia∣ment binding in  Ireland  and Moly∣neux  says he  who contends it should not hath  argued strongly  from an  English  Statute's not being supposed to extend to  Ireland  before Poyning's Act in the reign of Henry the Se∣venth  c  and a very  strong argu∣ment  it is which I hope hath already been shewn But the Hon Mr Barring∣ton proceeds to cite from the ParliamentRolls of the st of Edw I a memo∣randum of a very unwarrantable exer∣tion of RoyalPrerogative by that mo∣narch  viz  his sending a copy of  the Ordi∣nance  The Hon Mr Barrington in p very justly remarks concerning the Statute of Merton in the th year of Hen III that the said  Statute as well as many others of this century seems to be only an Ordinance the difference" says he "between  an Ordinance and Statute according to Sir Edward Coke consisting in this that the Ordinance wants the consent of  one component part  of the Legislature which is in all instances  that of the Commons  Now this seems to be exactly the case of the Act in question of the st of Edw I  de malefactoribus in Parcis  for though the Act itself declares that it was ordained by the King "at his Parliament"  Our Lord the King  at his Parliament  after Easter the st year of his reign at the instance of the Nobles of his realm hath granted and commanded to be from henceforth firmly observed  c  and  "at the instance of the Nobles of his realm"  yet the assent of the  Commons  is not  expressed  which was very well known even at that time to be necessary as the assent expressed in the Acts of the preceding year sufficiently demonstrates  viz  Our Lord the King  in his full Parliament and by his common Council  hath ordained  c  Statute  de defensione juris  E Again in the Statute of Vouchers  By his  common Council  hath ordained  c  Again in the Statute of Waste  Our Lord the King in his  full  Parlia∣ment holden  c  by a  general Council  hath or∣dained  so that a proper Form of declaring the  Assent  of the Commons even at that time was very well established notwithstanding that many Statutes are deficient therein and consequently are exception∣able in point of authority as for instance the Sta∣tute  de Escheatoribus  of the th year of this reign seems to be thus defective for though it is dated very speciously  like the Act in question  de malefactoribus in parcis    at the Parliament  of our Lord the King at Lincoln  c  yet it seems only to have been  agreed to  by the PrivyCouncil or the King's Coun∣cil    by  his Council  it was  agreed  and also commanded by the King himself    per Consilium Regis  concordatum est coram Domino Rege ipso Rege consentiente et illud extunc fieri et observari precipiente  c  so that it was apparently e∣nacted and ordained only  by the King and his Council  without the least mention of the  Consent  of the Parlia∣ment or of the  common Council  of the Kingdom and seems therefore to have been a mere  Order in Council  though artfully dated  "at the Parliament"  in order to give it the appearance of Law Sir Edward Coke in his th inst p  gives several instances of sup∣posed Statutes that had been repealed or disaffirmed wanting the Assent of the Commons which were ne∣vertheless published and enforced as real Statutes  viz  R II c stat touching enquiries of Heresies and H IV c against pretended Hereticks giving pow∣er to the Bishop or Ordinary  to convent before him or  imprison  any person suspected of Heresies  and ordaining contrary to the Laws of God that "an obstinate Heretick" or any person whom an ig∣norant popish Enthusiast was pleased to call so  shall be  burned before the people  both which as Sir Edward Coke remarks were  disavowed  by the Com∣mons and yet the pretended Acts  printed  inst p and inst p and Also Hen V  cap  which Sir Edward Coke by mistake calls  cap    against Preachers was disavowed the next Par∣liament by the Commons for that  they never as∣sented  and yet the  supposed  Act was  printed  Inst p  By such notorious  treachery  and  dishonesty  did the Zealots of the Romish Church introduce the papal Tyranny into  England  Sir Edward Coke in his d Inst pages and clearly proves from the ParliamentRolls and other Records the  fraudulent  introduction of the abovementioned Act in the th of Rich II by a popish Prelate  Sir Edward Coke calls him  "John Braibrook"  Inst p but according to Bishop Godwin his name was  "Robert Bray∣brook"    De Praesulibus Angliae Com  p but both of them testify that he was Bishop of London as well as Lord Chancellor Among the  blessed  effects of his  pious  fraud the following are repo  ted by Sir Edward Coke d Inst p  By colour of this  sup∣posed  Act  Rich II  certain persons that held  that Images  were not to be worshipped  c were holden in  strong prison  until they to redeem their vexation miserably yielded before these Masters of Divinity to take an Oath and did  swear to worship Images  which was against the moral and eternal Law of Almighty God  This and many other such instances of hardened Apostacy in popish Professors sufficiently justify our applying to the  papal Ty∣ranny  in general that Prophecy of the Apostle Paul concerning the  "Man of Sin"  that was to be  revealed  the Son of Perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is God  Thess ii to  and  whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth and shall  destroy  with the brightness of  his Coming  verse  O that all those persons whose hearts are not yet entirely  seared with the hot iron  of popish Enthusiasm may duly consider these glaring instances of popish craft in opposition to the Laws of God and con∣sequently the apparent danger of adhering to that church which has so notoriously perverted the Doctrines of the Gospel lest they should be found in communion with the Enemjes of Christ at his glorious  Coming  who at that time was LordChancellor  And the same learned author thereupon directs us to  mark well the manner of the penning the Act  for see∣ing  says he  the Commons did not assent there∣unto the words of the Act be  It is ordained and assented in this present Parliament that  c And so it was being but by the King and the Lords  The same rule enables us to judge concerning the authenticity of many other ancient Acts wherein the  Assent of the Commons  is not particularly mentioned and yet they are published The constitutions called  Sta∣tutum de Bigamis  for instance are declared  to have been "set forth in the Parliament  after Michaelmas"  c  Editae fuerunt apud Westm in parliamento post festum sancti Michaelis  c  Mag Char cum statutis quae antiqua vocantur  c  p b Ed  But when we  mark will the manner of the pen∣ning the Act  according to Sir Edward Coke's rule it appears to be very deficient in parliamentary Autho∣rity though he himself has taken great pains to prove its authenticity He remarks that  these words in the st chapter concordatum est per justiciarios et  alios sapientes  de Concilio Regni  prove it to be by Authority of Parliament for  Concilium Regni  says he  is the Lords and Commons  LEGALLY CALLED COMMUNE CONCILIUM REGNI  d Inst p  But even according to this argument the word "COMMUNE" is apparently wanting to make up what he himself allows to be the LEGAL expression for THE LORDS AND COMMONS and if we duly consider the words which immediately follow it must appear that the  "sapientes de Concilio Regni"  c here mentioned were only such particular  sapientes  as held  judicial places    qui consuetudines et  usum judiciorum  hactenus habu∣erunt  so that the expression cannot with propri∣ety be supposed to include the  whole representative Body of the Commons  as well as the Lords  c  but merely  the Judges  and such Lords Prelates and others as held  judicial places  and were of the  King's Council  mentioned in the preamble  viz  In praesentia  c  quorundam episcoporum Angliae et  aliorum de Concilio Regis  which Sir Edward Coke by what au∣thority I cannot guess is pleased to call a  Committee of both Houses  though it can mean nothing more than a meeting of the  King's PrivyCouncil  and the same may be said of that second meeting afterwards mentioned  "coram Domino Rege et Concilio suo"  where∣in the said Constitutions were again read  auditae et pub∣licatae  and  ordered to be ingrossed and observed  quod in scripturam redigerentur ad perpetuam memoriam et  quod firmiter observentur  which be pleased to remark is the principal  enacting  or  enforcing clause  of  this Act And therefore when we consider that the same was  agreed to  or  ordained  by THE JUDGES  as well as others    tam  Justiciarii  quam alii concordaverunt quod in scripturam  c  we may be assured that the meeting was  not the Parliament  in which the  Judges  as such have not any vote or voice at all ex∣cept that of  advising  but merely the  King's PrivyCouncil  and therefore Judge  Shard  as cited by Lord Coke had surely reason on his side when he  "beholding the manner of the penning of this Act"  com∣pare this with Lord Coke's own Rule to the same purpose abovementioned  was of opinion that it was no Act of Parliament  though Sir Edward Coke was pleased to censure him saying that  the contrary is holden by many express Authorities both before and after him  d Inst p  But what Au∣thorities can be equal to the  internal evidence  of the Act itself according to his own rule  Mark well the man∣ner of the penning P  c  For though it may have been allowed the force of an Act in judicial proceed∣ings as well as in the writings of some respectable commentators yet this is nothing but the natural con∣sequence of its having been published and printed without remarks among the other Acts  The  undue Authority  acquired by such impositions was still more notorious in the credit that has been given even by the Legislature itself to the three other  false  Statutes beforementioned against what the Papistscall Heresy Two of them are expressly recited and for∣mally  repealed by an Act of Parliament in the the st of Edward VI cap § as if they had  really  been  Statutes  ordained by the Authority of the whole Legislature and all the three false Sta∣tutes together are recited acknowledged and revived by another Act of Parliament in the P M cap and are yet again expressly intitled  Statutes  and as such are formally repealed by a third Act of Parliament in the st of Eliz c § But yet these se∣veral great Authorities by no means invalidate the Evidence which Sir Edward Coke has produced to prove that the said three wicked Ordinances were  really no Statutes  agreeable to the intention of those who unlawfully promoted it But Lord Shard declared from the Bench in the Assises at  Winchester anno th E that  this never was a Sta∣tute  Lib Assisarum p  Shard  Negativa nihil implicat Et ceo que vous parles del' Statut  de Bi∣gamis  ceo ne fuit unquam ascun  Statut  Another objection against this  supposed  Statute is the apparent evil intention of the th Article  de Bi∣gamis  from whence it has acquired its title which was to acknowledge a  foreign  popish Law as if it were already without interposition of Parlia∣ment of legal  force  in  England  and needed only some small explanation with respect to the manner of put∣ting it in execution an idea this which all  free  Eng∣lish Parliaments even in  popish times  most zealously opposed But above all the  Iniquity  of the  foreign Decree itself  which is introduced by this th Article affords the most ample argument against the  whole Sta∣tute  as it seems to have been drawn up principally for purpose of enforcing and smuggling in amongst o∣ther  articles that  diabolical  popish Decretal of Pope Gregory IX for discouraging lawful  Marriages  of Widows or Widowers The Marriages of  the Clergy  had been absolutely forbid  As the  "forbidding to marry"  is ranked by the apostle Paul a∣mongst the  "Doctrines of Devils"  Tim iv so the papal Antichrist in very early times began to discourage the  Mar∣riages  of the Clergy but Pope Gregory VII alias  Hildebrand  a Monster in Iniquity to prove which Dr Cave has cited unexception∣able authorities  Hist Liter  p more openly  revealed  the man of sin  in the th Century and amongst other notorious mani∣festations of most impious Tyranny "made a Decree" in that  from that time forward it shou'd no more be lawfull for Priestes  to marrye c  Recon's Reliques of Rome  p  b  This was apparently a  contrary Doctrine  to what St Paul preached and con∣sequently it subjects the Roman See to the  Anathema  of that Apostle  Though we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed  Gal i  The Marriage of the Clergy had ne∣ver before been forbidden except among the worst of Heretics but had been allowed by the whole Church of Christ from the time of the Apostles for above years down to this unhappy Century and with respect to  Ireland  in particular Sir Edward Coke informs us that  at a Synod holden  in Ireland  by  St Patrick  their Apostle it was unanimously agreed that  Irish Priests  should have Wives  Inst p  about years before and those who were already married  forcibly separated  from their wives  Becon's Reliques of Rome p  b  in open contradiction to the Laws of God by a Decree of Pope Gregory VII which was still further enforced by his successors and the  Clergy were compelled at length to submit to that un∣natural Tyranny by a variety of the most unjust and cruel laws and oppressions  See for instance the several Decrees of a Council held at Lon∣don by Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury in upon this sub∣ject to oblige the Clergy to forsake their  lawful  wives who were mentioned by the Council as  Concubines  and were ordered to be deli∣vered up to the Bishops as  Adulteresses  together with all the goods of those unfortunate husbands who persisted in their natural affection Tenth and last Article  Omnia vero mobilia lapsorum posthac Presbyterorum Diaconorum  c  meaning the goods of those who  continued to visit their wives    tradentur Episcopis et  Concu∣bina  cum rebus suis velut  Adultera  Howel's  Synopsis Canonum c  vol p  that satanical malice could possibly devise in the several ecclesiastical Synods of that and the following century  But the Decree against  Bigamy  was aimed at the  Laity  as well as Clergy since every Layman that could  read  was before entitled to the  Benefit of Clergy  when convicted of some particular offences which privilege was by this Decree taken away from all per∣sons called  bigami  or who had been twice married successively  Bigamie says Sir William Staunford in his "Plees del Coron" p "est un  counterplee  a Clergie" Lambard calls it an  un∣godly  and  popish Counterplea  Eiren p    s a dire que cestui qui demaunde le privilege de son Clergy suist espouse a un feme a tiel lieu deynz tiel dioces et que  le dit feme morust  et ad  espouse auter feme  c  the principal purpose of this new popish Ordinance being to cast an odium and restraint upon  lawful  second marriages and confound them with the  real  Felony of having two wives at one time  Thus the intention of the Romish Church was appa∣rently  diabolical  under a false pretence of extraordi∣nary purity to discourage  lawful Marriages  and thereby ensnare mankind through their natural frail∣ties into  real pollutions  and it is notorious that the popish tenet of  "forbidding to marry"  is one of the distinguishing  scriptural marks of  ANTICHRIST  for I cannot properly call it  a Statute  de malefactoribus in Parcis  into Ireland with an order to the ChiefJustice  of  Ireland  to enforce it and he remarks thereupon  This note fully  proves  says he  that it was supposed the King by his sole authority could  then introduce any  English  Law and will that authority  says he  be  lessened by the concurrence of the two Houses of Parliament  But  this by no means invalidates  the justice  of Mr Molyneux's argument while  the  injustice  of which he complains is still continued  viz  the inequitable preten∣sion to  bind  the Subjects of  Ireland  by Laws made  without their Assent  and  this even without any exception or just distinction concerning  external  or  inter∣nal  Government for the  Irish  themselves  do not deny the propriety of the pre∣tension in the former case The exer∣tion  of royal Prerogative abovementioned was certainly  illegal  and therefore must be esteemed  a bad precedent  for Mr Barrington himself who cites it does not pretend to justify it and I know that he will as readily allow that one  bad precedent  cannot justify another so that his  adding  still more precedents of the same kind  adds no weight  to his argu∣ment because the  authority  of  Prece∣dents  must always be weighed and go∣verned by  FirstPrinciples  and  constitu∣tional Law  otherwise we should be li∣able to adopt the most dangerous doc∣trines since there is nothing  so bad  but that a  Precedent  may be found for it  The second precedent of this nature which he has produced for the same pur∣pose still helps to confirm my observa∣tion on the other side of the question for this precedent is nothing less than the Order of  King Charles the First in the d year of his reign to the Trea∣surers and Chancellors of the Exche∣quer both of England and Ireland by which they are directed to increase the duties upon Irish exports which  shews  says he  that  it was then imagined  the King could tax Ireland by his Prerogative without the inter∣vention of Parliament  Now the precedent  "shews"  indeed as Mr Bar∣rington justly remarks  that it was then imagined  c that is it  shews  that this false doctrine  was then ima∣gined  by the King and those wretched Courtiers who either through ignorance or wickedness or both betrayed him  with their  unlawful  counsels but it by no means "shews" that such an arbi∣trary proceeding was really  Law  at that time any more than it is at present for the very same volume of Rymer's Foe∣dera  viz  tome xviii that contains the abovementioned precedent contains also other precedents of the like autho∣rity  which  equally  shew that it was then imagined the King could tax  EVEN ENGLAND ITSELF  by his Prerogative without the intervention of Parliament  See  A Declaration of his Majes∣ty's cleere  intention  in requiring the ayde of his loving subjects in  that way of Loane  The compulsive means used on this occasion to extort money from the people sufficiently demon∣strate that  "the way of Loane which"  was then  "intended by his Highness"  amounted to an  exaction  of the most notorious nature Many people were im∣prisoned and many others pressed into the land and sea service for refusing to contribute See Rushworth's  Collection vol p Sir Thomas Wentworth afterwards Lord Strafford was one of the sufferers on this occasion for  he was imprisoned  by the Lords of the Council  for refusing the royal Loan  Supple∣ment to the new and general Biographical Dictionary p  His Majesty  demanded  of the City of Lon∣don the loan of an hundred thousand pounds  Rushworth's Collection vol p  If such precedents were to be admitted or allowed any weight at all in this argument the very same reign would afford  prece∣dents  sufficient to render the King of England as despotic as the Emperor of Morocco In the fourth year of this reign "the King's Commission" was issued  to the LordTreasurer and Barons of the Exchequer and to the Customers of the Ports  to collect Ton∣nage and Poundage without authority of Parliament "Know ye that we by advice of  our Lords  " that is the  Lords of his Council  mentioned in the beginning of the Commission  declare  our Will  that all those duties be levied and collected as they were in the time of our father and in such manner  as we shall appoint  and if any person refuse to pay  then our Will is  that the LordTreasurer  shall commis to pri∣son  such so refusing till they conform themselves and  we give full Power  to all our officers from time to time to give assistance to the farmers of the same AS FULLY AS WHEN THEY WERE COLLECTED BY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT  Rushworth vol p  Here the Neglect of the  Authority of Par∣liament  is openly avowed though the forgetful Monarch was bound under a solemn oath at his coro∣nation to maintain the Laws of the land  which is now intended by his Highness  Tome xviii p  Nay  "it was then imagined"  it seems by those  disloyal  persons who falsely cal∣led  themselves  "the King's Friends"  that the King could not only  tax  his Eng∣lish Subjects by his Prerogative but that he could also  seize imprison try and even  HANG  them by martial Law with∣out Judge or Jury  The very same volume of Rymer's Foedera tome xviii affords several au∣thentic  precedents  for delegating such un∣limited Power by the King's Commission  viz  one for the county of Sussex p another for the whole county of Kent p and a third for the town and county of Southampton p  The Commissioners were impowered not only to use  martial Law  "against soldiers or mariners" but also against  OTHER  dissolute persons joining with them  or  any of them  whereby under  the latter denomi∣nation  a way was opened to render all other persons besides soldiers and mariners liable to the uncertain  decisions and hasty rigour of martial Law Any man whatever might be  unjustly  charged as a  dissolute person  c and the  accusation alone  whether  true  or  false  was sufficient to divest the person accused of all the privi∣leges of an English subject at the very time when he stood most in need of them So that if the King's Commissioners should happen to dislike any particular person within the county or limits of the jurisdiction expressed in their Commission it was possible for them to promote  such an accusation  and thereby render them∣selves  Judges in their own cause  since the King's Com∣mission contrary to his Majesty's most solemn engage∣ment before God at his coronation deprived the  accused  subject of a legal Trial and the due Process of the Law the only defence of  the innocent  by substitu∣ting an  illegal Process  in lieu of it And the horror of this monstrous usurpation of power was much increased by the following circumstance that the Commissioners were expressly authorized by their Commissions to  erect  Gallowes  or  Gibbetts  and  in such places as they shall think fit  and therefore as it would be  partial  to admit an  arbitrary precedent  as an evi∣dence on one side of the question  i  e  against  Ireland  without weighing at the same time the  similar precedents  in the same unfortunate reign which e∣qually affect the other side of the ques∣tion I mean the Privileges of the Eng∣lish  Legislature we must necessarily ex∣clude from the present enquiry the most distant idea that Mr Barrington's d Precedent  for taxing Ireland by Pre∣rogative  can possibly afford the least evidence against the  just Rights  of the Subjects in  Ireland  for if  such Precedents  are admitted to prove any thing at all they prove too much for they equally "shew that it was  then imagined the King could tax  " and oppress  even England it∣self  as well as  Ireland  by his Prero∣gative without  the intervention of Parliament  and I am very sure that the worthy writer who unguardedly cited from Rymer the abovementioned Precedent against  Ireland  would be as zealous to oppose any such doctrine as myself  His d Precedent is still more desti∣tute if possible of legal evidence  What would have been the answer of  the  English Legislature  says he in the year to the late claim of Independency in the Colonies will appear by the preamble to an Ordi∣nance of the d Oct of that year    Whereas in Virginia and the Islands of St Christopher's Nevis Montserrat and divers other islands and places in America which were planted at the cost and settled by the people and authority of this nation which are and ought to be subordinate to and dependent upon  England  and hath ever since the planting thereof and ought to be subject to such Laws Or∣ders and Regulations as  shall be made by the Parliament of England  p  But though this was indeed the opi∣nion of what Mr Barrington calls  the English Legislature  in the year  yet no just argument can be drawn from  thence with respect to the present ques∣tion  viz  the pretension to bind Ireland without  Representation  or  Assent  because it affords as good an argument as the o∣thers abovementioned for binding even  England  itself

thus far pursued the history of those arbitrary times as well to shew the danger of keeping a  standing Ar∣my  I might have saved myself much trouble upon this point had I been aware when I wrote the fore∣going pages that the danger of keeping  standing Armies  had been so well enforced by Mr Quincy in his Ob∣servations on the Boston Port Bill That ingenious and sensible Writer has very judiciously collected a number of unquestionable examples upon the subject which together with his own pertinent observations upon them demand the most serious attention not only of every  loyal  English Subject at this time but of all friends to mankind in general  and of permitting a  national Militia  to become such  The example of military Tyranny which I have already recited demonstrates the great danger of per∣mitting any part of a  national Militia  to be absent longer than is absolutely necessary from the particular  county  or  district  to which it properly belongs for as soon as  MilitiaMen  begin to depend upon their  Pay  or  "Solde"  "Dictionnaire militaire"  p  instead of their  industry  and the regular daily employments which they followed at home they cease to be the constitutional defenders of their country and become mere  Soldiers "Soldats"  or Mercenaries and therefore as it is now reported that great pains are at this time taken in the several American Co∣lonies to renew the ancient discipline of the  Militia  in their respective provinces it is a matter of great consequence as well for their own  internal  happiness and liberty as for the preservation of peace and union with the mothercountry and a continuance of that due constitutional subjection to  the Crown of GreatBritain  which is the true interest of all parties as it connects every branch of the empire and insures  mu∣tual  confidence and protection against  foreign  enemies that no persons whatever be allowed the rank of  Offi∣cers  in any of their provincial Regiments of  Militia  unless they have a competent fortune either in  Land  or Money to enable them to live comfortably without military pay lest they should ever entertain a  separate Interest  from that of the Public and like the degene∣rate  Militia  under Cromwell  enslave  their country Even a  common MilitiaMan  is not properly qualified for that  public Trust  for such it is unless from his situation in life or as the master of a family he has some permanent interest in the welfare of the commu∣nity  as to de∣monstrate  the insufficiency and  illegality  of the  Precedents  which have been cited to justify the fatal  pretension  of England to govern  Ireland  and the other Colo∣nies without the  Representation  and  As∣sent  of the respective inhabitants for we might as well enquire  what would have been the answer of the  English Legislature  in the year  when the  whole Legislature  was comprised within the narrow compass of Cromwell's  own doublet as "  in the year  " to which this learned writer has refer∣red us since the authority of the  nomi∣nal  Legislature in was entirely  ille∣gal  as well as that in both of them having been set up and maintained by the same unconstitutional arbitrary power and both of them totally void of the indispensable  Representation  of the people for though the wretched re∣mains of the LongParliament in being about Representatives or Mem∣bers instead of that had been e∣lected  Ainsi ce Parlement qui dans son commence∣ment avoit été composé du Roi d'une Chambre d'en∣viron sixvingts Seigneurs et d'une Chambre des Communes où il y

livres sterling de rente Cependant ces membres quoiqu'en si petit nombre s'attribuoient le  nom de Parliament  et agissoit comme ayant réuni dans leur corps le pouvoir qui avoit auparavant residé dans

from the length of time that the said Representa∣tives had continued without Reelection which was about ten years whereas it is well known that the due effect or  virtue  of popular  Representation  was formerly supposed to be incapable like some  annual  fruits of being so long pre∣served in useful purity without  a season∣able renewal  The sensible and patriotic author of the  Let∣ters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabi∣tants of the British Colonies  remarks in a note on page that  the last  Irish  Parliament continued  thirtythree years  that is  says he  during all the late reign The present Parliament there has continued from the beginning of this reign and probably will continue  says he  to the end  This is indeed as he justly calls it a most  per∣nicious particularity  it being a greater defect in the constitutional Liberties of  Ireland  than any other that I ever heard of and as it is apparently contrary to the intention and legal constitution of Parliaments must necessarily reflect the greatest dishonour on those persons whoever they are that have introduced this monstrous infringement on the natural Rights of the  Irish  Subjects  These excellent Letters which contain much season∣able instruction are said to be written by John Dick∣inson Esq the same eminent Author to whom thanks were most deservedly given by the Committee for the Province of Pensylvania on the st of July last  for the great assitance they had derived from the application of his eminent abilities to the service of his country in  another "performance" since published intitled "A new Essay" by the Pennsyl∣vanian Farmer  on the constitutional Power of GreatBritain over the Colonies in America  c  And the said Committee with great justice and pro∣priety recommended that performance  as highly deserving the perusal and serious consideration of every friend of liberty  c  from time to time  so that our more prudent Ancestors imi∣tating nature required also an  annual  Sir Edw Coke in his th Inst p speaking of "the matters of Parliament" informs us of the rea∣sons usually expressed in the writs for calling a new Parliament as  pro quibusdam arduis urgentibus ne∣gotiis nos statum et desensionem regni nostri Angliae et Ecclesiae Anglicanae concernentibus quod dam parlia∣mentum nostrum  c  teneri ordinavimus  c  And he  adds in the next paragraph "Now for as much" says he  as divers Laws and Statutes have been enacted and provided for these ends aforesaid and that divers mischiefs in particular and divers grie∣vances in general concerning the honour and safety of the King the State and defence of the King∣dome and of the Church of England might be prevented  an excellent Law  was made anno Edw III c which  being applied to the said Writs of Parliament  doth in a few and effectual words set down the true subject of a Parliament in these words  For the maintenance of the said articles and statutes and redress of divers mischiefs and grie∣vances which daily happen  A PARLIAMENT SHALL BE HOLDEN EVERY YEAR as another time was ordained by a statute  Which Statute here referred to was made in the th year of the same reign cap  Item it is accorded that a Parliament shall be hol∣den EVERY YEAR ONCE  and more often if need be  But Sir William Blackstone supposes that the King never was  obliged by these Statutes to call a  new  Parlia∣ment  every year  but only to permit a Parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dis∣patch of business  if need be  Com c p  It is too true indeed that our Kings in general did not think themselves "  obliged  by these Statutes" as they ought in conscience to have been for the safety  of their souls "to call  a new Parliament every year  " nay it is certain that many of them would never have called a Parliament at all had they not been  "obliged"  by necessity and the circumstances of the times But by what authority could a representative in one Parliament take his seat in the  next annual Parliament  without  re∣election  before any laws were made for lengthening the duration of Parliaments And besides if the King did "  only permit  a Parliament to sit annually"  c  by what authority could the Parliament be convened at all under such a circumstance seeing that a  mere per∣mission to sit  excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year However the learned Commentator himself very justly observes in a preceding page con∣cerning "the manner and time of assembling" that the  Parliament is regularly to be summoned by the King's  Writ  or Letter issued out of Chancery  And it is well known that these Writs are not addressed to the knights citizens and burgesses elected for any  for∣mer  Parliament but to  the Sheriffs alone  to cause  Kinghts Citizens c to be elected  for when the said Acts were made such an absurdity in politics had never been conceived in England as that of entrusting the  Repre∣sentation  of the people for  a term of years  as at pre∣sent to the persons elected On the contrary when the business of each Sessions was finished the Parlia∣ment of course was at an end and therefore Lord Coke did not speak in vain when he mentioned  "the  excellent Law"    viz  the Act for  annual  Parliaments  "being applied to the said Writs of Parliament"  c be∣fore recited  A man of so much goodsense learning and judge∣ment as Sir William Blackstone is master of must be well aware of the pernicious effects of investing the Representatives of the people with a legislative power beyond the constitutional term of A SINGLE SESSION without  Reelection  and therefore I cannot but be sur∣prized at the unguarded manner in which he has ex∣pressed himself in his Comment on the two  excellent Statutes  of Edward III for  annual  Parliaments  viz  that the King is not  or ever was obliged by these Statutes to call a  new  Parliament every year  c  He has caused the word  new  to be printed in  Italies  as if he meant thereby to insinuate that the Legislatures of those early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Representa∣tives a kind of  continued senatorial dignity  without  Reelection  for several years together whereas he certainly must have known that this corrupt  modorn  practice has produced a  new order  of men amongst us a most dangerous increase of aristocratical power which was entirely unknown to our Ancestors in the glorious reign of Edward III If he could shew that there  ever  was a Parliament in those times that was  not a  NEW  Parliament  his Comment might be justi∣fied But it is notorious that Writs were issued to the Sheriffs for  new  Elections almost  every year  du∣ring that whole reign The Writs for the most part  are still preserved with the Returns upon them In the catalogue of ElectionWrits which Prynn has given in his  Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva  p to there is an account of Writs issued for  new  Elections in every year of that King's reign between his th when the last Act for annual Parliaments was made and his th year except  viz  the th st and th years in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are also want∣ing as appears by Sir William Dugdale's  perfect Co∣py of Summons to Parliament of the Nobility  c  And yet this affords no absolute proof that Parliaments were not held  in those very years  for which the Writs are wanting because the bundles of Writs for the said years may have been lost or mislaid The only wonder is that more have not been absolutely lost when we consider the very little care that had been taken of them for Prynne found many of these Writs dispersed amongst a vast miscellaneous heap of other records on various subjects as he himself relates in his EpistleDedicatory to King Charles II of his  Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva  calling the said heap a  confused Chaos  under cor∣roding putrifying cobwebs dust and filth in the darkest corner of Caesar's Chapel in the White Tower as  mere useless Reliques not worthy to be calendred  c  And in page of that same work he speaks of Bundles of Writs whereof had only been then  lately  discovered filed and bundled by himself "But many of these Bundles" says he  are  not compleat  above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted consumed maymed torn or  utterly lost  through carelessness wet cankers or other casualties and some of them have not above two three or four Writs and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining  But that there were really Writs for Parliaments even in those  three  years which appear to be wanting at least in  two  of them is very certain because it was in the th year of this reign as Sir Edward Coke informs us Inst p that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III  whereupon the King in the  same year calleth his Court of Parliament  In this Parliament it was unanimously agreed by the Prelates Dukes Counts Barons and the  Commons  "et  la Common  " and again  "at Communes"    that the said King John nor no other could put himself nor his Realm nor his People in such Subjec∣tion without  their Assent  'sans assent de eux' and if it was done it was done without their Assent  that is without the Assent of the  Commons  for the Assent of the Barons was expressed in the Charter "and contrary to his Oath at his Coronation" P Whereupon Lord Coke remarks in the margin that  no King can put himself nor his Rea'm nor his People in such Subjection without Assent of the  Lords and Commons in Parliament  c  c as Sir Edward Coke proves from the ParliamentRolls of that year N  o  remarking at the same time that the Act then made was "never yet printed" See the margin th Inst p  And it appears that a Parliament was held also in the th year of this reign because supplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament as re∣lated by Sir Richard Baker in his Chronicle p  viz  in his eight and fortieth year  IN A PARLIA∣MENT is granted him a th of the Clergy and a th of the Laity  So that there is but  one  year out of so many in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments And annual Writs for  new  Elections were regularly issued for the first years of the following reign as appears by Prynn's  d part of a brief Register and Survey of the several kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs  pages and till Richard II that wretched perjured monarch had rendered himself  absolute  His arbitrary proceedings very soon afterwards occasioned his own loss of Power and total Ejectment from the Throne so that notwith∣standing his boasted  Firmness  in executing his favourite Measures he was at last reduced to the most abject acknowledgements of his own unworthiness to reign  After considering these unquestionable evidences of the issuing Writs  annually  for  new  Elections it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Blackstone's Comment on the said two Acts for  annual  Parliaments  Not that he the King is or ever was obliged by these Statutes to call a  new  Parlia∣ment every year but only to permit a Parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business  if need be  These last words  says he  are so  loose and vague  that such of our mo∣narchs as were enclined to govern without Parlia∣ments neglected the convoking them sometimes for a very considerable period under pretence that there  was no need of them  c  But  "these last words"  are not  so loose and vague  as ei∣ther to justify his own explanation of the said Statutes  viz  not  to call a  new  Parliament every year but only to  permit  a Parliament to sit  c  or to excuse in the least degree the criminal neglects of those depraved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them for the words  "if need be"  cannot according to the most obvious sense of the Act wherein they are found be applied to the main purpose of the Act the holding  annual Parliaments  but merely to the remaining part of the sentence  viz  and more often  that is "and more often if need be" The Order  that a Parliament shall be holden  EVERY YEAR ONCE  is absolute and the discretionary power expressed in the words  "if need be"  relates apparently to the calling Parliaments  "more often"  for if the said discretionary words  "if need be"  could with any propriety be applied to the whole sentence the Act itself would have been nugatory which could never be the  intention  of the Legislature but the true meaning and sense of the Legislature is very clearly proved by the histories of those times for it is manifest not only that  new  Representatives were elected  every year  with only one exception for  a considerable number of years after the last of the said Acts was made which confirms the main purpose of the Acts  viz  the holding  annual Parliaments  but it is also manifest that Parliaments were frequently held  "more often"  than once a year  Writs were issued for electing  new  Parliaments in the th year of Edw III in his th year in his th year and even in his th year and there appear to have been  new  Parliaments in the th of R II See  Prynne's Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva  p  which amply confirms also what I have before said concerning the meaning of the discretionary power expressed in the said Act by the words  "if need be"  These very frequent Elections sometimes two three and four times IN ONE YEAR sufficient∣ly prove that the power delegated by the people to their Representatives continued no longer in force than during the Session of the particular Parliament to which they were summoned which being  "once determined"  says Prynne st part of Brief Register  c  of Parl Writs p  they presently ceased to be Knights Ci∣tizens Burgesses Barons in any succeeding Parlia∣ments or Councils unless newly elected and retorned to serve in them by the King's  NEW  Writs as our LawBooks  referring to Ed IV  f  Brook Offi∣cer Hen VIII c  and experience re∣solve  c And therefore Judge Blackstone's insi∣nuation against the calling of a  new  Parliament has no real foundation for if it was the intention of the  Legislature in the two Acts abovementioned that the King should ever summon  any Parliament at all  they must necessarily be understood to mean a  new  Parlia∣ment on all occasions  i e  not only that the regular Par∣liaments which they ordained  to be  holden every  year once  should be  new  Parliaments but those also that should be summoned upon any extraordinary unfore∣seen occasions which is sufficiently expressed in the st of the said Acts by the words  and more often if need be  The meaning of the Act is  unquestion∣ably  proved by the actual issuing of writs to the She∣riffs for electing Knights Citizens  c  for  two three  and sometimes  four new  Parliaments  in one year  as mentioned above And if any person should object that such  very frequent Elections  must be at∣tended with insuperable difficulties and inconveniences we may quote the experience of all ancient times as affording ample and sufficient proofs to the contrary  there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of from Hen III till Edw IV  that is more than years  for ought that appears by the Retornes or Parlia∣mentRolls and NOT SO MUCH AS ONE DOUBLE RETORNE OR INDENTURE wherewith all the  late  Bundles or Writs are stored and the House of Commons and  late  Committees of Privileges pes∣tered perplexed to the  great retarding  of the more weighty public affairs of the King and King∣dom  Prynne Brevia Parl Rediv p  This  enormous evil the retardment of business by undue Returns will not I may venture without the spirit of prophecy to assert be remedied by the  new Regu∣lation  for that purpose The Commons were never in ancient times of Freedom esteemed the proper Judges of their own Elections but the  King  alone that is in his  limited  judicial capacity by his Justices and his sworn Juries in the Courts of CommonLaw If my countrymen will seriously consider all these points they must be convinced that the only sure method of healing the alarming distempers of our po∣litical Constitution  Viz  the enormous national Debt the numerous Pensions the secret

finally EAT THEM UP with  growing burtbens  if these fatal symptoms of the most dangerous  political consumption  are not speedily checked and thrown off by the wholesome prescriptions of  a free and equal Representation of  THE PEOPLE  is to restore to the people their ancient and just Right to elect a  new  Parliament "  every year once  and  more often if need be  " what∣soever Judge Blackstone may think of it  No Parliament could have any right to deprive the people of this inestimable Law unless the Representa∣tives had expressly consulted their respective consti∣tuents upon it as the alteration was of too much mo∣ment to be intrusted to the discretion of any  Repre∣sentatives  or  Deputies  whatsoever being infinitely more important than  any new devi  e  moved on the King's  behalf in Parliament  for his aid or the like  for the most essential and fundamental Right of the  whole body of the Commons  I mean the  Principals  not the  De∣puties  or  Agents  was materially injured by the fatal change and the people's power of controul for the general good of the kingdom was thereby apparently diminished so that if it is the duty of Representa∣tives even in  "any new device"  of mere  aid or the like  to consult their Constituents how much more upon the proposal of so material an altera∣tion in the Constitution ought they to have answered that  in this new device they  DARE NOT AGREE WITHOUT CONFERENCE WITH THEIR COUNTRIES  These are the words of Lord Coke who mentions them as the proper answer  when any new device is moved  c and he adds  whereby it appeareth" says he "that SUCH CONFERENCE  is warrantable by the Law and Custome of Parliament  Inst p  so that no  Representative  can be justified according to  "the Law and Custome of Parliament"  who refuses to receive the Instructions of his Constitu∣ents notwithstanding that several very sensible wor∣thy and I believe sincerely patriotic gentlemen have lately declared themselves to be of  a contrary opinion  but when they peruse the several authorities which I have cited concerning the absolute necessity of  a very frequent appeal  to the sense of  the whole body of the people  I trust in their candour and love of truth that they will alter their sentiments  renewal of their  parliamentary Represen∣tation  as being necessary for the mainte∣nance of public virtue  Thus the third Example given by this learned gentleman for taxing  Ireland  and  Virginia  c without the assent of  the respective inhabitants is manifest∣ly  illegal  since it must appear that  what he calls  the English Legistature  in the year  was totally void of  every essential and legal qualification to render it worthy of so distinguishing a  title but supposing that  the English Legistature in the year  had  been a legal and constitutional Parlia∣ment yet the Resolutions he has men∣tioned  would have been totally  illegal  and amount to no more than a mere vain  assertion as void of  Law  and  Reason  as it was really of  Effect  which is proved  by  the  ANSWER  of the English Legisla∣ture  at Virginia  then representing  the People  of that province to the un∣reasonable pretensions beforementioned of the  mock Legislature  at London for  otherwise if we were to consider  what would have been  THE ANSWER  or ra∣ther what  really were  THE CLAIMS of the  one Legislature  without considering at the same time the  real  ANSWER of  the other  to such  vain  and  unjust  preten∣sions we should lay ourselves open to the charge of  partiality  The judicious Author of a late  Ap∣ppeal to the Justice and Interests of the People of GreatBritain in the present Disputes with America  has reported the Answer of the  Virginian Legislature  on that occasion  Upon the dissolu∣tion of the Monarchy  says he  the Commonwealth dispatched a Go∣vernor WITH A SQUADRON to take possession of Virginia He was  per∣mitted  to land  upon Articles  of which the following is one and  decisively shews what were their original ideas of their Rights  Article th VIRGINIA  shall be free from all taxes customs and impositions whatsoever and none shall be imposed on them WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY  An Appeal  This little tract contains a great dear of intel∣ligence and sound reasoning concerning the natural Rights of mankind and is highly worthy the perusal of every good citizen who desires information concern∣ing the present differences with the British Colonies and upon the same occasion the clear and unanswer∣able arguments of another able writer also who signs himself  "Free Swiss"  must not be forgot The  title  of the work last mentioned seems indeed to be the  only  exceptionable part of it  viz  GreatBritain's Right to tax her Colonies placed in the clearest light by a Swiss  for a  Right  without a just foundation cannot with  propriety  be intituled  "a Right"  never∣theless he has most certainly  placed in  the clearest light  the  impropriety  of any such claim upon the Co∣lonies  c  p  I have dwelt much longer upon these  three Precedents  cited by the Honour∣able Mr Barrington  against Ireland  than I at first intended but the several diffe∣rent subjects to which I was naturally  led in the examination of them are of so much constitutional importance and so necessary to be known to every English∣man that I hope I may be excused for having as they occurred enlarged upon them in the several Notes which I have added to my Text  And with respect to the  three Prece∣dents  themselves I flatter myself that every impartial Reader who carefully considers what has been already said upon them will freely pronounce them  illegal  and totally unworthy of being allowed the least weight or consideration as  Pre∣cedents  against the  Independence  of  Ire∣land  since they are equally capable of being retorted  as Precedents  for enslaving even  England itself  but I must therefore repeat what I have before declared in p and elsewhere that I am very sure the worthy Writer who unguard∣edly cited them will be as zealous to  oppose any such doctrine as myself and I believe that I may farther assure myself that this learned Author will not be dis∣pleased or offended with the freedom of these remarks upon his Work for though I have not the honour to be per∣sonally acquainted with him yet I am sufficiently acquainted by other parts of his Writings with the general benevo∣lence and rectitude of his intentions and also that he is an admirer and fast friend to our  constitutional Liberty  which plain∣ly appears in many other parts of his use∣ful Work as well as myself so that any corrections  on that side of the question  will be taken I dare say by him as they were meant by me that is in good part and without the least ill will and his Work I speak of it in general has very deservedly acquired so much esteem and credit in the world that I could not without great injustice to the subject be∣fore me permit any arguments therein  upon the point in question to remain unanswered  The same observation I am inclined to think is equally applicable as well to the candour and disposition as to the writings of Sir William Blackstone whose very learned and useful Commen∣taries must also be strictly examined upon this point before I conclude my Declaration and had the other great and eminent writers Lord Coke Lord Chief Justice Vaughan Judge Jenkins  c  whose opinions upon the present subject I am obliged also to call in ques∣tion been still alive I should have thought myself equally sure of their be∣nevolence and forgiveness if I except Serjeant Mayart because the undeserved contempt with which he has treated Sir Richard Bolton the learned Author whom he attempted to answer prevents  my entertaining so charitable and friend∣ly an opinion of him as I do of the rest  Though I have now drawn these re∣marks concerning the Constitution of  Ireland  to a much greater length than I at first proposed yet I must not conclude whilst any material assertions of great authority remain unanswered Several of Sir Edward Coke's objections on this head have already towards the begin∣ning of this d part been proved I hope to want  foundation  but there still remains to be considered a further doctrine on the same point advanced by him in  Calvin's Case  which I trust will appear to be  equally unjust  though  founded  on the opinion of  all the Judges in England  "In Anno Reg El" says he  it was resolved by  all the Judges in En∣gland  in the case of Orurke  an Irish∣man  who had committed High Treason  in Ireland  that he by the Stat of Hen VIII c might be indicted arraigned and tried for the same  in England  according to the purview of the Statute  Co  But this doctrine notwithstanding the great authority with which it is here deli∣vered is obnoxious to a  fundamental Right of the Subject  the  Trial by a Jury of the  VICINAGE  or of  Neighbours to the Fact  which is due to every private person in the British Dominions according to the ancient Laws and Cus∣toms of this realm otherwise the govern∣ment would cease to be  limited  and thereby would cease to be  lawful  So that if Sir Edward Coke had been as much upon his guard when he quoted this  "Resolution of all the Judges"  as he was when he made his Remarks on that wicked Act of Parliament in the reign  of K Hen VII by which also the  fun∣damental Right of Trial by Juries  was violated he would neither have mentioned that Resolution of "all the Judges" or even the Act itself without guarding against the pernicious effects of such an unconstitutional doctrine by a proper censure as he did in the former case  "It is not almost credible to foresee" says he  when any when any  maxim  or  funda∣mental Law  of this realm  is altered  as elsewhere hath been observed what  dangerous inconveniences  do fol∣low which most expresely appeareth by this  most unjust and strange  Act of Hen VII for hereby not only  Empson  and  Dudley  themselves but such justices of peace  corrupt men  as they caused to be authorized com∣mitted most  grievous  and  heavy oppres∣sions  and  exactions  grinding of the face of the poor subjects by penal laws  be they never so obsolete or unfit for the time  by  information only  without any presentment or  Trial by Jury  being the antient  Birthright of the Subject  but to hear and determine the same  by their discretion  inflicting such pe∣nalty as  the Statutes not repealed imposed  c  th Inst c p  And afterwards he adds  This Statute of H VII we have recited and shewed  the just inconvenience there∣of  to the end  that the like  should never hereafter be attempted  in any Court of Parliament  And that others might avoid THE FEARFUL END OF THESE TWO TIMESERVERS  Empson  and  Dudley  Qui eorum ves∣tigia insistunt eorum exitus perhorres∣cant  ibid  But though these two wretched Judges were  hanged  for their  timeserving  yet  it appears by this account of Lord Coke that when they presumed to dispense with the interposition of  Juries  they acted by the  express Authority  of a  Statute  or  Act of Parliament  and though they were  Timeservers  so far as to acquiesce contrary  to their Duty as Judges  in enforcing that wicked and unconstitu∣tional Statute which exceeded the due bounds to which the English Legislature is necessarily  limited  yet it seems they  adjudged no penalties  in consequence thereof but such as  the Statutes not repealed imposed  And it is plain therefore that the crime of those two Judges against which Lord Coke men∣tioned  the FEARFUL END  of those two timeservers  as a warning to all future  JUDGES consisted in allowing  the force of Law  to a wicked unconstitu∣tional  Act of Parliament  by which  a  FUNDAMENTAL LAW  of this realm  was  "altered"  so that their  crime  was  exactly parallel to the equally  criminal  resolution of  "all the Judges in England"  in the case of  Orurke  the  Irishman  he∣forementioned which was in like manner founded on an express Act of Parliament  viz  Hen VIII c and parallel also to the crime for it must be so esteemed of  all the Judges of England  when they "resolved" in  Sir John Perrot's Case  that  for a Treason done in  IRELAND  the offender may be tried by the Statute  Hen VIII IN ENG∣LAND because the words of the Statute be  All Treasons committed out of the Realm of England  and IRELAND is out of the Realm of  England  c  d Inst p  But the Judges in both these cases were quite as  inexcusable  as the two  timeservers  Dudley and Empson for if the real  Intention  of the Legislature by the said Acts of and Hen VIII had been so general as to include all places whatever  out of the REALM  of Eng∣land  without leaving room for plead∣ing a  legal  exception in behalf of those territories wherein the laws liberties and constitution of the Realm of Eng∣land were already established the said Judges ought to have known that  a fun∣damental Law of this Realm  was there∣by  "altered"  and consequently that they incurred the risk of being HANGED by some future administration like their  timeserving  predecessors for  presuming  to enforce such  unconstitutional Acts of Parliament  by which according to the  just  Remark of the  same  great Reporter on a former Act  viz  H  a fun∣damental Law of the Realm  was  altered  whereas they really might have attributed a constitutional meaning to the said Acts by duly distinguishing those  They might have alledged that if an ambas∣sador sent from this kingdom to France Spain or to any other foreign State  out of the Dominions  of the im∣perial Crown of GreatBritain should notoriously be∣tray his King and Country and plot their Destruction  he might  legally  and  constitutionally  be punished accord∣ing to the  letter  and  meaning  of the said Acts of Parlia∣ment and also that any other British Subject whatso∣ever that is in like manner  guilty of Treason  to his King and Country during his residence in a foreign realm may be treated accordingly because all men certainly are accountable to their country for any such Treason and as they cannot be tried in the foreign realms where the offences were committed it is rea∣sonable and just to suppose that they may be tried in  England  by an impartial Jury though the same a  e not  "neighbours to the fact"  nor impannelled  de vi∣cineta  that is from the neighbourhood where the of∣fence was committed for though this circumstance is  essentially necessary to the Legality of a Jury  in every other case yet the law does not require  impossibilities  and it may therefore perhaps be  legally dispensed with  when it is apparent from the nature of the case that such an unexceptionable Jury cannot be obtained and yet that an exemplary punishment is manifestly due to the Trai∣tor or Traitors but when  Treasons  and other of∣fences are committed in any country  under the domi∣nion  of the Crown of  England  where the criminals might have a  legal  Trial  according to the laws of this realm  as in  Ireland  the said  most essential formality  of being tried by a Jury  de vicineto  cannot be dispensed with because this would deprive the Subject of an  un∣alienable Right  and  alter a  fundamental Law of this  realm  so that any Judge who should venture to enforce the said Act IN SUCH CASES would mani∣festly DESERVE TO BE HANGED as much as Dudley and Empson  The examination of this point gives some general idea how far the  Power  of the high Court of Parliament notwithstanding that imaginary  "omnipotency"  which some men have ignorantly attributed to it may be allow∣ed to extend  for the more high and absolute the juris∣diction of the court is the MORE JUST and HONOUR∣ABLE it ought to be in the proceeding and to give example of Justice to inferior courts  th Inst p  Which is most strictly true for whenever the supreme temporal powers exceed the  honourable  limits of  natural Justice  and  Truth  they lessen their own dignity and in proportion to their errors forfeit that respectful con∣sideration and esteem which would otherwise be due from their subjects And we must remember likewise that the being  "just and honourable"  in mere profession of words without the  reality  will have very little weight with the body of the  People  who are endued with  commonsense  as well as their superiors to discern what is  just  and  honourable  from that which is  merely called so  and that a pretence to  justice and honour  in a bad cause is only an aggravation of  injury  and  iniquity  The most wicked ordinances have sometimes been ush∣ered into the world under the most sanctified titles and specious pretences The abominable Act beforemen∣tioned  of Hen VII was expressly said to be against "great enormities and offences which" have  been committed and have daily contrary to the  good Statutes  for many and divers behoovefull considera∣tions severally made and ordained to the displea∣sure of  Almighty God  and the great let of  the com∣mon Law  and wealth of the land  Now notwithstanding this  FAIR FLATTERING PREAMBLE  as Sir Edward Coke calls it yet "THE PURVIEW  of that Act  " as he justly remarked  tended in the execution contrary  EX DIAMETRO viz  to the high displeasure of  ALMIGHTY GOD  the great  LET  nay the  UTTER SUBVERSION  of the  COMMON LAW  and the  GREAT LET  of the Wealth of this Land  ibid p  as indeed every other Act of Parliament must inevitably do which perverts  the due course of the Law  and robs the subjects of any  fundamental Right  As for instance let us suppose st that an Act is made to stop up or proscribe the passage to any  seaport town  or any  haven shore of the sea  or  great river  without the Consent and to the great Detriment of all the neighbouring inhabitants such an Act would be "FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG" as being contrary to the first or most essential Right of mankind the  Law of Nature  for it is clearly laid down by Bracton that all  ports havens shores of the sea  and  great rivers  are free to all peaceable passengers but more particu∣larly we may add to the nearest inhabitants by the  Law of Na∣ture and of Nations  NATURALI VERO JURE  communia sunt omnia haec aqua profluens aer et  MARE  et  LITTORA MARIS quasi maris accessoria NEMO enim ad lit  us maris accedere  pro∣hibetur  dum tamen a villis et aedificiis abstineat quia littora sunt DE JURE GENTIUM COMMUNIA sicut et mare  c  And again  Publica vero sunt  OMNIA FLUMINA  et  PORTUS c RIPARUM  etiam usus publicus est  DE JURE GENTIUM  sicut ipsius sluminis Itaque naves ad eas applicare funes arboribus ibi natis re∣ligare  ONUS ALIQUAE in eis reponere CUIVIS LIBER EST sicuti por ipsum fluvium naviga  e sed proprietas earum est illorum quorum praediis adbaerent  c  lib c p  So that such an Act would be mainifestly contrary to the  Law of Nature  and  Nations  and consequently is such as NO LEGISLATURE ON EARTH can ren∣der valid or  legal  because  natural Rights  and the  Laws of Nature  are immutable "  Jura enim naturalia sunt  IMMUTABILIA" And again  Jura enim naturalia dicuntur  IMMUTABILIA quia non possunt ex toto ABROGARI VEL AUFIRRI  c  Ib c p  And be∣sides it must be remembered that to proscribe the passage or  high∣way  to any city or town especially if it is done with an avowed design to distress the inhabitants thereof in their lawful occupations is an  intolerable nuisance  which is clearly adjudged in Law to be such a "MALUM IN SE" as can  never be made lawful    But  MALUM IN SE  the King  NOR ANY OTHER  can dispense  Mes  MALUM  IN SE LE ROY NE NUL AUTRE poit dispenser sicome le Roi yeut pardonner a occire un autre ou lui licence A FAIRE NUSANCE IN LE HAUT CHEMIN CEO EST VOID  c  Hen VII p  "Wherefore  it is generally true  " as Judge Vaughan remarks  that  MALUM PER SE  cannot be dispensed with  c  Rep p  Or dly suppose an Act should be made to impower the Gover∣nor of a Province  "without the consent of the Council"  to appoint Judges and other LawOfficers  who shall hold their Commissions  DURING THE PLEASURE OF  the Crown  instead of the approved and established  legal  condition  "quamdiu se bene gesserint"  thereby setting up WILL AND PLEASURE ABOVE LAW AND  JUSTICE which are the first and most essential Rights of the Peo∣ple Would not such an Act tend to  the great  LET nay the UTTER SUBVERSION  of the CommonLaw  c Suppose like∣wise it should be o  dained in such an Act that  the Freeholders and Inhabitants of the several Townships  in any particular pro∣vince shall  not  be permitted even when  they are authorized to assemble together    to treat upon matters of the  MOST GENERAL CON∣CERN    except the business  be  expressed in the leave given by the Governor  which implies that  one  or a few individuals have a more  equitable  pretension  to treat upon matters of the most  GENE∣RAL CONCERN  than even the  general Meeting  or whose col∣lective Body of persons themselves who are  concerned  a principle which is subversive of all  "common Right and natural Equity"  and consequently must tend "to the high Displeasure of almighty God" as well as "  the great  LET  of the wealth of the land  " And to compleat the iniquity of such an imaginary Act let us suppose a clause whereby "  it shall and may  BE LAWFUL" LAWFUL  for the Justices  c  in any Cause or Action which shall be brought to issue to order the said Cause or Action to be tried in  ANY COUNTY OTHER THAN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE SAID CAUSE OR ACTION SHALL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OR LAID BY A JURY OF SUCH OTHER COUNTY AS THEY SHALL JUDGE FIT  c  Such a clause must strike at the very Foundation of Justice  Or dly if this imaginary Act should not be esteemed sufficiently injurious to the People though it is apparently calculated to  rob them  of that  fundamental  and unalienable Right  the Trial by a Jury  DE VICINETO  let us suppose an Act still more PARTIAL if possible in the  "administration of Justice"  and rendeted still more aggravating and insulting by bearing a title  contrary  EX DIA∣METAO  to the purport of it Let us I say endeavour to  stretch that notorious  Injustice  to the utmost extent of inconvenience and injury that a wicked imagination can possibly conceive or express that is to establish a Power of removing the Causes and Trials and even those which are of the most importance  viz  for  capital of∣fences  not only to a neighbouring  County  or to a more distant  Colony  but even if caprice should require it to the furthermost extent of the Globe that is without aggravation as far as  the East is from the West  Or thly if we may conceive the idea of an Act calculated to  "fulfil the Measure of Iniquity"  let us suppose an Act expressly for the purpose of establishing the arbitrary Laws of France  Quod Principi placuit habet vigorem Legis  c see my Preface there∣upon and in order that it may be destructive to  the Souls  as well as the  Bodies  and Property of the wretched Subjects as I have al∣ready shewn let us suppose that ample provision is made therein for the  Establishment  not the mere Toleration of downright  Idolatry  and  ImageWorship  for the Toleration of the most notorious EXOR∣CISMS  "Exorcismus Aquae" "Exorcismum Salis" "Ex∣orciso te creatura Salis"  see the Missal and SPIRITUAL WITCHCRAFT In short let us suppose that such an Act provides for the Establishment of that adulterated Religion which has long been perplexed with all the Enthusiasm of  heathen  ignorance  long Prayers vain Repetitions "as the Heathen do"  and bears the most apparent marks of  Antichrist  insomuch that we might be certain at least who was the first  spiritual  Instigator and Promoter of such a Bill though the  bodily  Proposer of it should be lucky enough toremain undiscovered Who shall presume to say  that any Power on Earth  whatsoever weak and ignorant men may think of the  Omnipo∣tence  of Parliament has Authority or Right either to establish such notorious spiritual Abominations or to render  lawful  such gross Ini∣quity and palpable Injustice  And therefore if any such Act should be  made in our days howsoever specious the preamble it is our duty as good subjects to remember that the  same ought to be considered as  null and void of itself  and that it cannot authorize or indemnify the Judges  or any other persons who presume to enforce It for all men and  Judges  in particular ought to take warn∣ing  from  the fearful end  of those two timeservers Dudley and Empson  that such an active obedience would perhaps  endanger their own necks  For suppose dly that such an Act was to be decked with the most flattering title let us call it for instance  An Act for the  BETTER REGULATING  the government  of any particular province or dly let it be called  An Act for  THE MORE IMPARTIAL ADMINIS∣TRATION OF JUSTICE  in the cases of Persons questioned for any acts done by them  IN THE EXECU∣TION OF THE LAW  or for the Suppression  Though  "the Suppression of Riots and Tumults"  is here included as one of  "the fair flattering"  PRETENCES in the Title of the above mentioned imaginary Act of Parliament yet it it is apparent that the  wicked Act itself  would be the most effectual method that could possibly have been devised for THE PROMOTION instead of "THE SUPPRESSION  of Riots and Tumults  " for which conse∣quently none but the Promoters and Makers of such an unjust Law could with any propriety be esteemed accountabled since it is true even to a maxim that  He makes THE STRIFE or "TUMULT"  who first offends    "Qui primum peccat ille facit rixam"  Prin Leg et Aequit p  of Riots and Tumults  c or thly suppose such an injurious and unlawful Act should be intitled  An Act for making  MORE EFFECTUAL PROVISION FOR THE GOVERN∣MENT OF  any particular province  c  yet if  "the Purview"  as Lord Coke justly remarked of any such imaginary Acts should  tend in the execution con∣trary  EX DIAMETRO  to all these specious pretences set forth in their titles and preambles by establishing  principles whereby  any fundamental Law  of the Realm is altered  the same would manifestly  endanger the necks  I must repeat it of any Judges that were im∣prudent enough to enforce them notwithstanding that the express Authority of  King Lords  and  Commons  should be alledged as their sufficient warrant because we find that the  like Authority  afforded no justification or excuse for poor Empson and Dudley  in a similar case  neither did the consideration of their having acted by  parliamentary Authority  render their wretched fate more pitiable in the eyes of the public And there∣fore I sincerely wish that all modern  Timeservers  may have prudence enough to form by that plain example some reasonable judgement concerning the imaginary  "Omnipotence of Parliament"  which cannot insure its wretched votaries from the most ignominious punish∣ment nor secure even  the Parliament itself  from the just and lasting Censures of the Sages of our Law such as  Lord Coke  for instance who warned them in ano∣ther place also expressly upon this point  By colour of which Act  says he meaning the said un∣just Act of Hen VII  shaking this  FUNDA∣MENTAL LAW  the Law of Juries  it is not credible what  HORRIBLE OPPRESSIONS  and  EX∣ACTIONS  to the undoing of infinite numbers of people were committed by  Sir Rich Empson Knt  and  Edm Dudley  c and upon this  UNJUST  and  INJU∣RIOUS ACT  as commonly in like cases it falleth out a new Office was erected  c And in the next paragraph he adds  And the  FEARFULL  ENDS OF THESE TWO OPPRESSORS  says he  should deterred others from committing the like and should  ADMONISH PARLIAMENTS  that in∣stead of this ordinary and pretious Trial  PER LEGEM TERRAE  they bring not in absolute and partial Trials by Discretion  d Inst p  particu∣lar  cases wherein they may LEGALLY be enforced without thwarting any  funda∣mental Law of the Realm  From what has been said I hope it will appear sufficiently clear to my Read∣ers  that the severe censure which Lord Coke so justly bestowed on the two wick∣ed  Judges Dudley and Empson for ACTING BY THE AUTHORITY  OF AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF PARLIAMENT is equally  applicable for the very same reason to the Resolutions beforementioned of  ALL  THE JUDGES IN ENGLAND  though Lord Coke himself  even the author of the  former censure  has cited them without the least animadversion  The Judges in the d year of Queen Elizabeth who gave their opinion in the case of  Orurk  Or  "Ornick"  See d Inst p margin  the Irishman  are the more inexcusable for their  Resolution  upon the Act of Hen VIII c because they had an  excellent Example  set them but a few years before that time by two very learned and respectable brethren the Judges  Wray  and  Dyer  together with the said Queen's AttorneyGeneral con∣cerning several  similar Acts of Parlia∣ment  which Example is worthy the most serious attention of  all future Judges  that they may ever be  careful  to restrain by a  legal  construction not only the said Acts of King Henry VIII and King  Edward VI but all others likewise that may happen to be equally liable to alter the free Constitution of the realm and rob the subjects of any essential  "fundamental Right"  that ought to be esteemed  unalienable  Judge Dyer himself has reported the circumstances of it He informs us  Gerrarde  Chauncelor de  Irelande  move cest question al Counsel la Roygne s fi un Countee ou Seignior

against the combined force of FOUR EXPRESS ACTS OF PAR∣LIAMENT And such a reason though it had been advanced only by  a single Judge  or even by  a private person  is  certainly of much more weight than the opinion of  "all the Judges in England"  when given  contrary to reason  or against the tenor of  any fundamental Law  I never heard that  this Reason  assign∣ed by the Judges Wray and Dyer

an Act of the th Cha I c whereby the  "due Process of the Law"  or  the or∣dinary Course of the Law  see sect v is again reestablished in opposition to the  unlawful authority that had been usurp∣ed

doubt of it may  be informed  by the feelings of his own breast  if he will only take the trouble for a moment to suppose  himself  in such a situation through the false accusations of his enemies that nothing but an im∣partial Trial by  a Jury of Neighbours  well acquainted with him and his case and the malignity of his accusers can possibly save him from destruction And farther it is apparent that the said  due Process of the Law  by a Jury  de vi∣cineto  is now become an  unalterable  part of the Constitution and must ever remain in force not only against all contrary  Resolutions  and  Opinions of the Judges  such as I have mentioned but even against the express authority of any Act of Parliament that happens inadvertently to have been made to the contrary be∣cause all such must necessarily  BE HOLDEN FOR NONE  according to the Ed III c which is cited  by Judge Jenkins for that purpose  Jenkinsius Redivivus p  and though it may be alledged against the authority of this Act of Parliament that another Act may unbind what it has bound according to the maxim  eodem modo quo quid constituitur eodem modo dissolvitur  yet a due consideration of  this very maxim  will afford us a substantial argument to the contrary for at the time the said Act was made  viz  in the Ed III the  Great Charter  had been  expressly confirmed by many Parliaments  not only in the reigns of that noble king's ancestors but also by at least TWELVE  preceding Parliaments  And  Parliaments  at that time were preserved  in purily and independence by a very frequent renewal of  THE POPULAR REPRESENTATION  viz  every year once and  MORE OFTEN  if  there was  need  c which I have already proved in pages to of this Declaration so that there was not then the least room even for the bare  suspicion  of undue influence  even in his own glorious reign so that the Parlia∣ment in his d year had certainly suf∣ficient  authority to add to their confir∣mation of the Charters that  if  ANY STATUTE  be made to the contrary that shall be  HOLDEN FOR NONE  And the reason is plain for no Statute what∣ever  eodem modo constituitur  is ordained by so  great Authority  as that which  Mag∣na Charta  has at length acquired by the express confirmation from time to time of  so many different Kings and Parlia∣ments  In the time of Sir Edward Coke the Charters had been expressly confirmed by THIRTYTWO DIFFERENT PARLIAMENTS as he himself wit∣nesses in the Proeme of his d Institute  The said Charters  says he  have been confirmed esta∣blished and commanded to be put in execution by se∣veral Acts of Parliament  The wisdom of ages has made it venerable and stamped it with an authority equal to the  Constitution  itself of which it is in reality a most essential and  fundamental  part so that any attempt to repeal  Though some particular articles of Magna Charta are indeed rendered useless at this day by subsequent Statutes yet this affords no argument a∣gainst the general stability of the Charter with re∣spect to its main object the Freedom of the People It is a Charter of Liberties and therefore the sub∣sequent Statutes which  enlarged those Liberties  by annihilating the several oppressive customs which are mentioned therein and limited within certain bounds as  Knights Service Escuage Wards  and  Li∣veries  c cannot be said to  operate against  the Char∣ter but rather  in aid of it  for though the said op∣pressive Tenures and dangerous Prerogatives are per∣mitted by the Charter in  a certain degree  yet the ap∣parent intention of the several articles wherein they are mentioned was not to  establish  but only to  re∣strain  them as much as the circumstances temper and prejudices of those early times would permit so that the Statutes which afterwards entirely removed the oppression cannot be esteemed contrary to the pur∣pose of the Charter because they enlarged those Li∣berties and Franchises of the people to which the Charter itself is so apparently dedicated  it would be  treason to the state This glorious Char∣ter must therefore ever continue unre∣pealed and even the articles which seem at present useless must ever remain in force to prevent the  Oppressions and Prerogatives  there named from being extended beyond  certain limits  in case the same should ever hereafter be revived No single Act of Parliament can unbind  or remove the limits here laid down nothing less than the same  accumulated Authority  by which the Charter is now established can possibly set it aside or any part of it according to  the Maxim  be∣fore recited  eodem modo quo quid consti∣tuitur eodem modo dissolvitur  for no single Act of Parliament  eodem modo constituitur  is ordained in the  same manner  The many repeated confirmations of its authority were a work of ages so that the said authority cannot  legally  be set aside unless it be done  eodem modo quo con∣stituitur  that is by the repeated suffra∣ges of  as many Parliaments against it  as have already expressly confirmed it and God forbid that any such gross depravity and corruption should ever obtain such a continuance in this kingdom as to ac∣complish so great an evil for that could not be without a total national reprobacy dangerous to us not only in this world but also in the next  It must therefore be obvious to every person who duly considers all these cir∣cumstances that  the Resolutions of  ALL THE JUDGES IN ENGLAND  in the ca∣ses of  Orurke  or  Ornicke the Irishman  and  Sir John Perrot  were contrary to a FUN∣DAMENTAL LAW in the  Great Char∣ter  and consequently ought to be "HOLDEN FOR NONE" according to the express determination of the Parlia∣ment in the d Ed III c  Viz  That the  Great Charter  and the  Char∣ter of the Forest  be holden and kept in all points and if  any Statute be made to the contrary  THAT SHALL BE HOLDEN FOR NONE  and ought to be  VOID IN THE LAW  and  HOLDEN FOR ERROUR  ac∣cording to the second chapter    It is assented and accorded for the good governance of the  Commons  that no man be put to answer without Presentment before Justices or matter of Record or by DUE PROCESS AND WRIT ORIGINAL  according to the  OLD LAW OF THE LAND  which I have already proved to signify in an  especial  manner the Trial by a Jury of the  Vicinage    and if  ANY THING  from hence∣forth be done to the contrary it shall be  VOID IN THE LAW  and holden for Error  of the  same excellent Statute because the two Acts of Parliament of the and H on which they grounded their opinion cannot have any  legal  force notwith∣standing the  literal  meaning of the  gene∣ral expressions  therein when applied to of∣fences committed in any country province or  colony  whatsoever that is subject to the imperial crown of GreatBritain so that even if  Ireland  had been  especially na∣med  therein the said Acts would have been so far from  binding  that kingdom according to the effect supposed by Lord Coke Judge Vaughan Judge Blackstone and others that the very NAMING  Ire∣land  for such purposes as were intended by the said Acts would have rendered them  absolutely  "NULL AND VOID" and to be "HOLDEN FOR NONE" because they would in that case have been di∣rectly  contrary  to the  Great Charter  whereas at present there are some par∣ticular cases as I have before remarked wherein they may perhaps be allowed a legal force  Now though what I have already re∣marked will probably be thought a  suffi∣cient  Answer to the two Resolutions  of all the Judges in England  cited by  Lord Coke  as precedents against the Liber∣ties of our brethren  the subjects of  IRE∣LAND I am nevertheless inclined to add one more testimony against the said  Reso∣lutions  which has no less authority than that even of  Lord Coke himself  in another part of his writings against all  similar  Resolutions and Opinions  Let him now bear witness both against the said  Judges  and  himself    And albeit Judgements in the King's Courts  says he  are of high regard  in Law and  judicia  are accounted as  jurisdicta  yet it is provided by Act of Parliament that if  any Judgement be given contrary to any of the points of the Great Charter or Charta de Foresta  BY THE JUSTICES  or by any other of the King's Ministers  c  it shall be undone and  HOLDEN FOR NOUGHT  Proeme to his d Institute  If Lord Coke when he mentioned the BINDING IRELAND in the Parliament of  England  "BY SPECIAL WORDS" th Inst p and  BY BEING ESPECIALLY NAMED  Calvin's Case th Rep p had meant nothing more than what is clearly proved by his  one exam∣ple for all  beforementioned  viz  that a Representation of the Subjects in  Ireland  ought to be summoned to the  En∣glish  Parliament whenever  an Act of Parliament shall be made in England  especially  concerning the Statute of Ireland  there would have been no essential difference between  his Opinion  and that  natural Justice  for which I con∣tend but alas that great man has confirmed his error upon that subject in another part of  Calvin's Case  p wherein he declares  that albeit  IRE∣LAND  was a distinct dominion yet  THE TITLE THEREOF BEING BY CONQUEST  the same by  judgement of law  might by express words be bound by Act of the Parliament of England  Here he has luckily given us another  reason  which leads us to the detection of his error  "Yet"  says he  THE TITLE THEREOF BEING BY CON∣QUEST  c  Now it is very re∣markable that so many of the most emi∣nent law writers should have  copied  and  adopted  this erroneous opinion without  examining the force of it  as if the autho∣rity and real worth of this learned Writer  in other respects were sufficient to render valid a  mistaken and groundless argument  Judge Jenkins indeed has  adopted  the opinion without quoting  the reasons  but Judge Vaughan who has also  adopted  the opinion refers us expressly to Lord Coke's  reason  against  Ireland viz  the  title by conquest    That it is a CON∣QUERED KINGDOM  says he  is not doubted but admitted  IN CALVIN'S CASE  several times  c Vaughan's Rep p And upon the strength of this  reason  he proceeds very confidently to  determine  what things the Parliament of Ireland cannot do  and to give instances  of Laws made in the Parliament of  ENGLAND  binding  IRELAND  p  of which neither the first  A Law concerning the Homage of Parce∣ners called  "Statutum Hiberniae"  Hen III "Mr Cay" says the Hon Mr Barrington  very properly observes that 'IT IS NOT AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT' and cites the old Abridgement title  Homage  He allows it a place however in his edition of the Statutes not to differ from for∣mer editors This in some measure gives the au∣thority of Legislation  says this learned Gentle∣man ironically  to the King's LawPrinters and yet if such an ordinance is inserted in every edition of the Statutes for near centuries together by printers known to print under the authority of the King's Patent and the Parliament permits this for such a length of time it becomes a question of some difficulty to say what force it may have ac∣quired No such question fortunately can ever a∣rise upon this Statute  as it is merely a  RESCRIP∣TUM PRINCIPIS to certain  Milites  Adventurers probably in the Conquest of  Ireland  or their De∣scendants who had doubts with regard to the Te∣nure of lands holden by Knights Service and de∣seending to Coparceners

very singular  says he  that though this Ordinance hath found a place amongst the  English  Acts of Par∣liament the Collection of  Irish  Statutes printed by authority at Dublin begins only with the Ordi∣nances of  Kilkenny  in the d year of Edward the d There can be no doubt however that this Law extends to  Ireland  if not repealed by some  Irish  Act of Parliament as by Poyning's Law in the time of Henry the Seventh  all precedent  Eng∣lish Statutes are made to bind in  Ireland  Ib p  Nevertheless I must beg leave to observe that this is neither an  English  nor an  Irish  Statute but a mere  LetterPatent  of the King  by the Assent of his Council  though it might be dated perhaps during the sit∣tings of a Parliament at Nottingham  Edward par la grace de Dieu Roy Dengliterre Seignor

printed in the StatuteBooks  This seems also to be the case with the d voucher which he has produced for his assertion  viz  Laws for  IRELAND made by E per advisa∣mentum  Concilii nostri  c  That is if he meant the Laws contained in the Ordinance of that King's st year  viz  Ordinatio facta pro Statu Terrae Hiberniae  because this Ordinance is no more intitled to the name of  a Law  or  Act of Parliament  than the two former for long before this period the necessity of expressing  the Assent of the Commons  in order to render an Act  valid  was well understood as the Hon Mr Barrington remarks on the th of Ed III  "The Statutes now begin to appear"  says he  in a new and more regular form  c  whilst the Pre∣amble  IN EVERY INSTANCE  makes express men∣tion of the  CONCURRENCE OF THE COMMONS  p  whereas this Ordinance has no such mention of their "CONCURRENCE" but only the  Assent of the Council  that is the Assent of the  King  's Council  "de assensu consilii nostri ordinanda duximus"  c whereas the Assent of the  great Council of the Nation  is expressed in very different terms as I have remarked in the former notes as also in the notes on pages and  But if this learned Judge meant any other Laws "  for  IRELAND  made by Edward  III" than this Or∣dinance of his st year for he refers us in the mar∣gin to the ParliamentRolls of his th year yet the same cannot afford the least proof or precedent for  binding Ireland  in England without Assent because I have already cited ample testimony that the Parliament  of  Ireland  in those days was frequently summoned to  England  sometimes to confer with the  English  Parlia∣ment and sometimes to meet the King and his Coun∣cil in distinct Seffions of the  Irish  Legislature See pages to  His fourth voucher adds no more confirmation to his assertion than the three former for though it is really  an Act of Parliament  yet it cannot be produced as a precedent for  binding  the  Irish  Subjects  without their Consent  because it is made expressly for the pur∣pose of  enforcing  an Act of the  Irish Parliament "Es∣tatute "fait en la terre d' Ireland"  and therefore as the question relates only to the carrying the said Law into execution which is properly the office of the King and his Courts it is certainly indifferent whe∣ther be is advised therein by his  PrivyCouncil  or by his  CommonCouncil  of  England  especially as the lat∣ter in the case before us were so far from advising the King to invade or alter the  Irish  Law that they confirm it in the strongest terms  que le di  Estatute estoise  EN SA ENTIER FORCE  et que bien et duement soit gardez et  PLEINEMENT EXECUTE  c  With respect to his th voucher referring us to "  the late Acts made in    Car  " c it would be very unfair to draw from thence any conclusions unfavour∣able to the Privileges of the  Irish  Parliament because that was the fatal year of the  popish massacre in  Ire∣land  when the Protestant Subjects of that kingdom were almost universally oppressed and all Law and Regularity overturned by the open Rebellion of the popish party so that even the Parliament of  Scotland  as well as the Parliament of  England  thought it right to take the affairs of  Ireland  under their consi∣deration at that unfortunate juncture and sent two Commissioners properly instructed by the States of that kingdom to treat with the  English  Parliament about the means of suppressing the  Irish  Rebellion Sir John Temple's History of the Irish Rebellions p to  But notwithstanding that some Acts might have been made in the th of Charles I without the As∣sent of the  Irish  Parliament yet they afford no evi∣dence in favour of that opinion for which they are cited by the learned Judge for Mr Molyneux has proved that by the repeal of those very Acts of Cha I that they afford an argument even on the  other side of the question  viz  that the Parliament of  IRELAND  may repeal an Act made in  ENGLAND  in relation to the affairs of  IRELAND  p  And again with respect to the th and last voucher under that head  viz  the resolution of the Judges in the ExchequerChamber in the case of the Mer∣chants of Waterford it by no means relates to the question in dispute for that concerns only the expor∣tation and importation of goods and the  Irish  do not pretend to contest the Right of GreatBritain to the  Dominion of the Seas  nor do they deny the Power of the British Parliament to regulate Commerce as I have before remarked Now as it appears that  not one  of these Precedents is sufficient for the purpose pro∣posed  and as we cannot doubt but that so learned a Lawyer as Judge Vaughan as I have before observed of Judge Coke would select the most applicable Pre∣cedents that could be found the doctrine which he has built upon these insufficient Precedents must ne∣cessarily fall to the ground  Amongst the  modern  writers who have likewise unfortunately  adopted  the same  erroneous opinion of Lord Coke the learned Judge Blackstone is the most  eminent and therefore demands the most careful examination  In the introduction to his Commenta∣ries p he hath delivered his senti∣ments much to the same effect as the other more ancient writers already men∣tioned That  no Acts of the  ENGLISH  Parliament since the twelfth of King John extended into that kingdom  Ireland  unless it were  SPECIALLY NAMED  or  INCLUDED UNDER GENE∣RAL WORDS  such as  WITHIN ANY OF THE KING'S DOMINIONS  c  And in page he repeats the same doctrine  that no Acts of the English Parliament made since the th Hen VII do now  bind  the people of  Ireland  unless SPECIALLY NAMED or INCLUDED UNDER GENERAL  WORDS  For this  inclusive  Power of GENERAL WORDS Judge Black stone refers us to Lord Coke's Rep but I shall take no pains to refute any error in that  last Collection  of his Reports  "which are well known"  says the honourable Mr Barrington p  not to be of equal authority with those that precede  And besides I have already demonstrated I hope in my Com∣ment on the Cases of  Orurke  the  Irishman  and  Sir John Perrot  as also by the clear and decisive Resolu∣tion of the worthy Judges  Wray  and  Dyer  and the Attorney General  Gerrard  for restraining the GENE∣RAL WORDS of  four express Acts of Parliament  that all such  general Words  in Statutes must be duly re∣strained by a  legal Construction  if the Judges who en∣force them mean to avoid the Risk of exemplary pu∣nishment  And in the same para∣graph he assigns the very same reason drawn from  the Conquest  of  Ireland  which had misled both Lord Coke and Judge Vaughan before him  And on the other hand  says he  it is  EQUAL∣LY CLEAR  that where Ireland is par∣ticularly named or  IS INCLUDED UN∣DER GENERAL WORDS  they are  BOUND  by such Acts of Parliament  though I hope I have already made  the contrary  appear EQUALLY CLEAR  For this  follows  says he  from the very na∣ture and constitution of a  DEPENDENT STATE  dependence being very little else but an  OBLIGATION TO CONFORM TO THE WILL OR LAW OF THAT SUPERIOR PERSON OR STATE  The  Irish  do not pretend to deny a  legal Dependence  on the superior State of  England  for they acknowledge that the Sovereignty of their Island is inseparably an∣nexed to the Crown of  England  of which I believe I have already quoted some examples but when  De∣pendencs  is defined in the manner Judge Blackstone re∣presents it as  an Obligation to conform to the Will or Law  of the superior Person or State  c  it ceases to be a  legal  Dependence according to the  common Law and Constitution of England  though the learned Judge is certainly right enough if he will be pleased to con∣fine his Definition of  Dependence  to those Countries where the  civil Law  prevails as in  France  or  Prussia  for instance because in such despotic Realms the op∣pressed People seem indeed to acknowledge  an Obligation to conform to the  Will  or  Law  of the  su∣perior Person or State  and the learned Commentator if he meant to refer to the Laws of such enslaved People as these must certainly be allowed to have delivered his meaning in the most  expressive  and  judicious  terms that he could possibly have chosen  for such a purpose  for in speaking of  "the Will"  of  that superior Person or State  to which he supposes  an Obligation to con∣form  c  he mentions it as a synonimous term to  the word  "Law" viz "Will or Law"  says he that is  an Obligation to conform to the  Will or Law  of that superior Person or State  c  which is in∣deed a most lively description of the dangerous  unli∣mited  Power of the French Prussian or Imperial Ad∣ministrations of Government for wheresoever these two words WILL  and  LAW are considered as synoni∣mous there  Law  must of course be any thing be it ever so wicked or iniquitous that the Superior pleases that is in short  Quod Principi placuit Legis habet Vi∣gorem  But I have already held up that detestable Maxim of the  civil Law  to the view of my Readers and therefore I shall now only remark in general that neither the LAWS of  England  nor the LAWS of  Ireland  acknowledge and such Precept as the setting up the WILL of a Superior for LAW or what is the same thing they do not acknowledge any such state of  "Dependence"  as an OBLIGATION  to conform to the  "WILL OR LAW" those synominous Terms  of the superior Person or State  c  Our Laws  indeed acknowledge the King of GreatBritain for the time being as the  "Superior"  or  Head  of both Kingdoms but the  "Dependence"  which is thereby required of  "the Inferior"  whether the term  Enferior  he applied to the inferior Kingdom as  subordi∣nate  or to Persons  viz  to each Individual as  a Sub∣ject  in either case is a  politic  or  legal "Dependence"  and not  absolute  and  unlimited    Principatu namque nedum  REGALI  sed et  POLITICO  ipse suo populo domi∣natur  The Laws leave no room to suppose that there is "  an Obligation to conform to the  WILL  or  LAW" if the latter has no other foundation than the  Will    of that superior Person  Nam non potest Rex Angliae  AD LIBITUM SUUM  Leges mutare Regni sui Principatu namque nedum  REGALI  c  as above  Fortescue de Laud Leg Angliae c p b  And if even the  King's  Power is not  regal  but  politic  and  limited  which the same learned Writer Chancellor Fortescue has clearly proved in a distinct Tract expressly on that subject intitled  The Difference between  absolute  and  limited  Monarchy  much less can the  King's Subjects  be said to exercise a  Sovereign's legislative Power  Com p  over any Nation or Peo∣ple whatsoever that have no share in the said Power by a due  Representation  of their own collective body for the  sovereign Majesty of the People  ought never to be exerted except in their own necessary defence or to maintain the  natural Rights  and  equitable Privileges  of Mankind against Tyrants and Oppressors for the good of Society in general through that disinterested evangelical Principle  "Goodwill towards men"  But when on the contrary any particular Nation or Peo∣ple exerts that  "sovereign legislative Power"  to deprive another different Nation of their  natural Rights and Li∣berties  they no longer deserve to enjoy their  own  and indeed  divine  JUSTICE will inevitably overtake them sooner or later for as the crimes of individuals will surely be punished with  personal  condemnation so  na∣tional sins  must feel the additional Weight of temporal  national Retribution  which I trust I have demonstra∣ted in a little Tract intended sometime or other for Publication intitled  The Law of Retribution and in particular of God's temporal Vengeance on Slave∣holders  upon which the inferior depends  And then he immediately adds  The original  and true ground  says he  of this Superiority in the present case is what  we usually call though somewhat  IM∣PROPERLY  very "IMPROPERLY" indeed "THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST"  c  Now I most heartily join with him in his application of the adverb "IMPRO∣PERLY" to the words which follow  viz  "THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST" whenever it is mentioned as a  reason  to justify this claim or imaginary right of binding the people of  Ireland  either by being  specially named  or included under  general words  for I hope I shall con∣vince that learned gentleman himself as well as the rest of my readers before I conclude that  THE RIGHT OF CON∣QUEST  is not  the original and true ground  of any such  superiority in the present case  as he supposes but on the contrary that it seems rather to have  been  "the original and true ground"  of all the dangerous mistakes which have been made upon this important question by Lord Coke Judge Vaughan and him∣self for if this learned gentleman will be pleased to review this argument founded on  "the Right of Conquest"  as applied by himself and the other two very eminent Writers beforementioned to the free kingdom of  Ireland  I trust through the great opinion I entertain of his can∣dour and good sense that he will readily give it up for though the  Right of Conquest  may be as he says  a Right allowed by  THE LAW OF NATIONS  if not by that of Nature  that is in some particular cases yet it certainly is contra∣ry both to  "the Law of Nations"  and  "that of Nature"  to which he has ap∣pealed that  "the Right of Conquest"  should be pleaded for  binding  the  Conque∣rors themselves or their Descendants with∣out their Assent  for of such consist the  greatest part of the landed interest in  Ire∣land  at this day who are entitled to all the Rights and Liberties of the ANCIENT CONQUERORS by  inheritance  and  lineal de∣scent  Titles so  just  and  sacred  that I am sure Judge Blackstone will never per∣sist in opposing them especially when he sees hereafter by what authority I make this assertion Nay the  Right of Con∣quest  is so bad a plea to extenuate the  iniquity  of exerting any such oppressive and  unlimited  power that it fails in  Reason  and in natural  Justice  even when applied as an excuse for oppressing  the conquered  much less therefore can it affect the Liberties and natural Rights of the  Conquerors  themselves  That these  Liberties  and  natural Rights  of the  conquerors  are entailed upon a very great part if not the most  numerous  at least the most  considerable in point of rank and fortune  of the present inhabi∣tants  of  Ireland  is a point I believe which cannot be contested for Judge Blackstone himself has declared in a preceding page  That the in∣habitants of  IRELAND are FOR THE MOST PART  The following Extract from Sir Wm Petty's Political Survey of Ireland will corroborate this just Remark of Sir William Blackstone  The  British  Protestants and Church have threefourths of all the Lands fivesixths of all the housing ninetenths of all the housing in walled towns and places of strength twothirds of the foreign trade  c  p    descended from the  ENGLISH who planted it  as a kind of  COLONY  after the Conquest  of it by King Henry the Second  c  and con∣sequently "THE MOST PART" of the said Inhabitants ought to be considered as stand∣ing in the place of the  Conquerors  rather than of the  Conquered  so that if the  Reason  assigned by these three learned men has  any weight viz  that some de∣gree of  superiority  is acquired by  Right of Conquest  it must be allowed that "THE  MOST PART of the said Inhabitants are equally intitled to it in Right of their  conquering Ancestors  for it would be highly injurious to deprive them of their  hereditary Privileges  which descend to them from the actual Conquerors them∣selvesAnd on the other hand it would be equally  unjust wicked  and  im∣politic  to make any partial distinction between them and the descendants of the  conquered Irish  who after many years struggle are now at last happily incor∣potated and blended with them as  one free People  Having now examined the opinions of the most eminent Writers that have fa∣voured this  Notion  of a Right in the Bri∣tish Parliament to  bind  the Subjects of  Ireland "when especially named"  I trust it will appear to every impartial Reader that such doctrine is so far from having any real  foundation  to support it that it  is really diametrically opposite to some of the most essential  foundations of Law  and is apparently  subversive  of one of the first principles of the British  Constitution  so that it will be needless for me to take notice of any thing that has been said to the  same purpose  by inferior Writers or by the Editors or Collectors of Law Dic∣tionaries  c  who have  only quoted  these great authorities which I have already demonstrated to be  erroneous  and I may therefore I hope be now allowed to repeat with double satisfaction and cer∣tainty what I before asserted only upon  general Principles  in the first Part of this Declaration  viz  that  the true constitu∣tional mode of  CONNECTING  British Do∣minions that are otherwise separated by  NATURE  is demonstrated by the esta∣blished example of the union of  GREAT BRITAIN  and  IRELAND  which by long experience has proved to be sufficiently ef∣fectual  p  But notwithstanding that I have al∣ready been led to a tedious length of ar∣gument by the necessary examination of so many authors I must beg leave still to add some general remarks upon the abovementioned groundless argument drawn from  the Right of Conquest  for Judge Blackstone has been equally un∣guarded in what he has laid down con∣cerning the  American Colonies  in p of the same volume where he has made a very improper use of this same mista∣ken notion about the Right of Conquest  "Our  American  Plantations" says he "are principally of this latter sort"  viz  conquered or ceded countries of which he was treating in the preceding sen∣tence "being obtained" says he  in the last century either by RIGHT OF CONQUEST  and driving out the Na∣tives with what natural Justice I shall not at present enquire or by Trea∣ties  And therefore  says he  the  COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND  as such has no  ALLOWANCE  or authority there  they being  no part of the mother Country but distinct though dependent Dominions  But when he reconsiders this part of his work I trust he will al∣low that the COMMON LAW of  England  is principally founded on  Reason natural Justice  and  the eternal Laws of God  and consequently all that part of the COM∣MON LAW which arises from  these foun∣dations  MUST HAVE  allowance or authority  not only  there viz  in the English Colonies but  every where else  if the unjust pretensions of Tyrants were to be duly restrained by  Law  and  Equity  and with respect to the  remaining part  of the COMMON LAW consisting in an∣cient and approved  usages  and  customs pe∣culiar to English Subjects  he will not be backward I trust to grant them also  "allowance or authority there"  when he  is reminded that these  conquered Countries  are not inhabited by  the conquered People  but chiefly by  British Subjects  successors to  the Conquerors  who are entitled by  Birthright  to the  Common Law of Eng∣land  and every other privilege of Eng∣lishmen quite as much as those  English Subjects  mentioned by him at the top of the same page  "For it hath been held"  says he  that if an uninhabited country be discovered and  PLANTED BY ENG∣LISH SUBJECTS ALL THE EN∣GLISH LAWS THEN IN BEING  which are the  BIRTHRIGHT OF EVERY SUBJECT  are immediately  THERE IN FORCE  Com p  This doctrine is unquestionable and the more so because allowed by him∣self And though he has been pleased to add that  this must be understood with very many and very great restrictions  that  such Colonists carry with them only so much of the English Law  as is ap∣plicable  to their own situation  c  yet it must be apparent that if they  "carry with them"  any Laws  at all  it most be by virtue of their  natural Right as Englishmen  whereby they are certain∣ly as much entitled  to all  I mean all the English Laws that were in being when these several Colonies respectively were es∣tablished and therefore though they  used  in the infant state of each Colony  only so much of the English Law  as was ap∣plicable to  their own situation  and it is absurd to suppose that they would  use  more whether intitled to it or not yet this does not affect their undoubted  Right to the whole  which  Right  descends to posterity and successors in the same manner as all other  inheritances  it be∣ing indeed their  very best inheri∣tance  Judge Blackstone himself has called it in the the very same page  "the BirthRight of every Subject"  And Equity surely entitles the increasing Colonies continually as  occasions may arise from their improve∣ments to the use and benefit of  all be∣neficial Laws  which were in force at the time of their ancestors emigration  That these however  must be under∣stood with  some "Restrictions"  can∣not be deniedas the Laws of  "Re∣venue"  for instance which the learn∣ed Gentleman himself has mentioned for these were merely local and cannot therefore be  legally  enforced in any new Dominions without the express Assent or Grant of the Inhabitants in such new Dominions the same being absolutely ne∣cessary to give them a  local  effect within the said Dominions because nothing but the  free Grant  and  Assent  of the  Inhabitants and Landholders  gave them force  origi∣nally  even in the mother Country and therefore nothing but the  like authority  that is the free Grant of  the Inhabi∣tants upon the spot  wherever they are  introduced can possibly render them  legal just  and  binding  in any other part of the world so that it must necessarily appear that no new acquired Territories settled by British Subjects can  legally  be taxed by English Acts of Parliament nor be bound thereby in their  internal  Government without such manifest  in∣justice  and  iniquity  as must necessarily render  null and void  all such pretended Acts for otherwise if they were ad∣mitted they would render all the tem∣poral hereditary possessions and property of the Subjects in the Colonies entirely  uncertain  which is one of the most odious circumstances in the eye of the Law that can be mentioned  "Quod cer∣tum est retinendum est  quod INCERTUM EST  dimittendum  Nay  quod  INCERTUM EST NIHIL EST" This is the cen∣sure of Law upon all the Acts of Men which fall under the judgement of the Law If then THE LAW so judge of  the Acts of Men HOLDING THEM FOR NOUGHT and VOYDE that are INCER∣TAINE how much more then doth THE LAW REQUIRE CERTAINTY  in her own Acts  which are to bind all Men  The Liberty of the Subject against the pretended Power of Imposi∣tions by Wm Hakewil  I have been the more particular as well here as upon Orurke's case before∣mentioned in expressing the necessity of restraining the  Power of Parliament  within the bounds of  Reason Justice  and  natural Equity  because I find it is too common an error that an  Act of Parliament is omnipotent  and that whatever is or∣dained by Parliament  must be Law  with∣out any exception of  Right  or  Wrong White  or  Black Truth  or  Falsehood  which God be thanked is very far from being  true  though the learned Commen∣tator Judge Blackstone upon the very  same point the  Omnipotence of Parlia∣ment  has unguardedly said  True it is that what the Parliament doth no Authority upon earth can undo  Com p  But that worthy Gentleman needs only to be reminded that if it should unfortunately happen from any  oversight  or  misunderstanding  that  what the Parliament doth  is in the least contrary either to the Laws of Reason Nature pure Morality natural Equity and Justice or to that  Benevolence  This  Benevolence  or due  Consideration  for the  natural Rights  of all mankind is properly called  Jus Gentium  the  Law of Nations  The Law of Nations seems to be almost banished at this time from  Europe  The late felonious and arbitrary Division of Poland between three of the greatest Powers in Europe The late iniquitous attempts against the antient Republic of Venice and the Swiss Can∣tons and the late unjust Claims upon the free Cities of Dantzick Hamburgh  c  The Robberies and horrid Murders which for these ten years past have been committed by the French on the  poor wretched  Inhabitants of the little Island of Corsica upon pretence of an  un∣lawful  Cession of Sovereignty from the Genoese and the like abo∣minable Iniquity upon the like false pretence lately carried on even by the  English  themselves against the poor helpless Charibbs at St Vincent'sare melancholy Proofs either that the Europeans in general are most profoundly ignorant of the  Law of Nations  or that they are fallen into a state of the must abandoned Wiekedness and P  ofligacy  which universal Law as likewise ALL THE OTHER HEADS abovemen∣tioned is necessarily included in what is commonly called  natural Religion  consisting of the primary or  eternal Laws  of God and whatsoever is contrary to any of these is "MALUM IN SE" which no authority on earth can make lawful see note in p and

SERRA VOIDE  if in any of  these points  it should unfortunately hap∣pen I say that  what the Parliament doth  is really defective or made contrary thereto the same ought to be "HOLDEN FOR NONE" There needs  "no authority upon earth"  to undo what is  so done  for it is  null and void  of itself notwithstanding the united authority of King Lords and Commons And whenever any Acts have been thus in advertently or too hastily made the most honourable method of getting rid of them is by the same authority to  declare  them null and void  and not merely to  re∣peal  them because the latter is not a sufficient reparation to  injured justice and truth  for as all men are fallible it is disingenuous and highly dishonourable in any man or body of men whatsoever not to acknowledge a  mistake  or  error  when the same is fairly demonstrated  The power and jurisdiction of the Parliament for making of Laws  c is NOT therefore  so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons  as supposed by Lord Coke Inst p  within any bounds  since the just  bounds  and limits of it are so very clearly defined as well as the due bounds of  regal Power  that they fall within the judgement of every man who has COMMON SENSE to distinguish GOOD from EVIL or RIGHT from WRONG so that the imaginary OMNIPOTENCE OF PARLIAMENT is not  only as Judge Blackstone has declared  "a figure rather too bold"  but even to∣tally false and unjust because the Par∣liament is manifestly limited as all powers on earth must be and CANNOT  do every thing that is not  NATURALLY  impossible  though Judge Blackstone supposes it can Com p for the  Power  "Quia illa potestas" potestas Juris  folius Dei est potestas autem injuriae diaboli et non Dei et cujus horum opera fecerit

conscience when they exceed  just limits  any more than the threats of a  lawless Banditti  and therefore we may truly say  of all the Branches of the Legis∣lature together  I mean their united

are  MOST BOUND  to  GOOD ORDERS  and to  RICHTREASON  Sadler's Rights p  It would be happy for this kingdom if all Members of Parliament were sen∣sible of these  indispensible limitations  and therefore though I have thought it my duty to oppose what Judge Black∣stone has unfortunately allowed concern∣ing the imaginary OMNIPOTENCE OF  PARLIAMENT yet I think myself bound most heartily to concur with him in what he has mentioned in the same page  That it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom that such members be delegated to this important Trust as are most emi∣nent for their probity their fortitude and their knowledge for it was a known apophthegm of the great Lord Treasurer Burleigh "that England could never be ruined but by a Par∣liament  c  But before I conclude this d part of my Declaration it may perhaps be expected that I should apologize for the tedious length of it and yet when my Readers consider that it was necessary for me to answer the assertions of some of the most eminent Law Writers that this na∣tion perhaps ever produced they will not think their time ill spent I hope in  following me through this minute exami∣nation of the said assertions especially as they relate to the most  important points of the  CONSTITUTION  and  COMMON LAW  of England and Ireland  And I hope also that my Readers will not charge me  with presumption  for ha∣ving in the course of this argument opposed the opinions of such very respect∣able Writers as  Baron Puffendorf  on THE CIVIL LAW and  the Judges Coke Vaugh∣an Jenkins and Blackstone  and  the Hon Mr Barrington on  THE LAWS OF ENG∣LAND If my Remarks should in any part be thought too severe I am sorry for it I can only assure my Readers that the least  personal disrespect  is not intended for I am sufficiently sensible of my own unworthiness and  too superficial knowledge in all things  and have therefore most carefully avoided any doctrine which may seem to rest merely upon the weak foun∣dation  of my own opinion but where∣ever I have ventured to dissent from the opinions of these approved writers I have assigned plain  reasons  for it or o∣ther  proper authorities  and I desire to be trusted no farther than these  plain rea∣sons  and  authorities  will fairly warrant I hope I may be permitted to use the same apology for pointing out mistakes in the opinions of these very learned writers which the  Hon Mr Justice Bar∣rington  has applied particularly to the Institutes and Reports of  Sir Edward Coke  which  "being"  says he  the best  LAWCHART
