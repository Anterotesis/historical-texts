 THE PASQUINADE WITH NOTES VARIORUM  BOOK the FIRST  Ay 'tis a Crust a lasting Crust for the rogues I would be glad to see the proudest of them all but dare to nibble at thisif they do it will rub their Gums for them I promise you  BAYES  LONDON  Printed and Sold by C MOUNTFORT near the  Royal Exchange  MDCCLIII Price One Shilling  THE PASQUINADE BOOK the FIRST  Pasquinade  As it is highly necessary that every writer who publishes his works for the instruction and emolument of the publick should write in such a manner as to be understood by those of a common capacity as well as by those who as the poet says  Peruse a work of wit  With the same spirit that its author writ  Or if he does not as it is highly becoming the scholiast to make them familiar to such readers I should think myself very unworthy to illustrate the following poem did I pass over the  name  itself which tho' some Critics may understand I am persuaded many do notKnow then that  Pasquin  was  Cobler  who work'd in his stall at  Rome  about the beginning of the fifteenth Century and being a fellow of ready wit and a satyrical disposition the people flock'd about him to hear him rally and talk politics at which he was very expert After his decease the statue of a Gladiator being dug up near his stall it was set up and call'd  Pasquin  the  wits  his pupils taking it in their heads in honour to their  dead  master to stick their lampoons satires and libels thereon all which were termed  Pasquinades  If thou doubtest reader whether this poem was ever hung on the said statue if thou take a walk to a certain corner of the palace of  Ursines  in  Rome  thou may'st enquire further concerning it  O Chief in verse O ev'ry Muses' care  Line  O chief in verse  The great personage here addressed from what we may gather from the following lines can be no other than Dr  John Hill Acad Rege Scient Burd  c  Soc  and  Inspector General  of Great Britain  Pride of each mortal and immortal Fair  Whether enraptur'd with  Urania  's charms  Lines  Whether enraptur'd c  These lines seem to hint at the amours of Mr  Inspector  who has so often celebrated in his works his  Chloes Daphnes  and  Amandas  all Ladies of quality whose favours some have been bold enough to say have been of the same nature with those he received from the Muses purely imaginary but we presume not to assert this opinion 'till we have some authority to suppose those Ladies as chaste as the Sisters of  Parnassus  Or sunk in  Chloe  or  Amanda  's arms  Whether eternal Bays thy temples grace  Or thy lac'd  nightcap  well supplies their place  Line  Or thy lac'd nightcap  A nightcap ornamented with Brussels lace which this Enamorato used to wear on particular occasions when honour'd in the embraces of  Quality  ANON  Whether with  Goddess  or with earthly  Qual  You saunter down  Parnassus  or the  Mal    Line  You saunter down  Alluding to a  Je ne scais quoi  in the carriage of this Gentleman by some virulent writers called an  indolent waddle  by others  a janty Air  Vide  Libitina fine conflictu Woodward's Letter c  Or in Philosophy profoundly wise  You pore intent with microscopic eyes  Line  You pore intent with microscopic eyes  From the contradiction this passage seems to imply to that of another great author and philosopher who says  Why has not Man a microscopic Eye  It might possibly be concluded that some mistake had happened either in transcribing or printing this line and that our author intended it  thro' microscopic eyes  meaning the eyes or the glasses of his Microscope But if any credit may be given to this Gentleman's discoveries in natural philosophy we must conclude he himself is possess'd of eyes infinitely more discerning than the rest of the Virtuosi having found out such animalculae and their method of existence as no other Philosopher ever did or ever will tho' assisted by all the helps of the most improved Microscope unless possess'd of the same kind of eyes The visual rays to which are so ductile that they not only are directed from real objects but from  no  objects at all which accomplishment alone should sufficiently establish this great man as the prince of Philosophers and empower him to correct and censure the researches of others As we must own the eye that can  see  what is  invisible  is certainly more able to explore the secrets of nature than that which can see only  what is to be seen  I find no reason therefore to vary the reading in the text  New worlds discover in a  Catharine pear  Line  New worlds discover in a Catharine pear  Among the philosophic researches hinted in the preceding annotation take the following made by this Gentleman on a rotten pear  It was but a very small portion of the covered furface of the pear that could be brought within the area of the Microscope but this appeared under its influence a wide extent of territory varied with hills and lawns with winding hollows open plains and shadowy thickets  INSPECTOR  A very material objection indeed arises against our author in respect that he calls it a  Catharine Pear  as this philosopher in his preamble to the experiment expressly says it was a  French  Pear in which we cannot think him mistaken as he took such particular notice of the said pear for says he it was cut by a person very fond of Pears who out of that excessive fondness eat a thin slice and reserved the rest to another opportunity That he cried  Pah  at seeing it again when rotten and that it was cut at the largest end  Vide Inspector  So that from these circumstances we must remark this as an error in our author  Or monsters animate in sour small beer  Serenely trace their  fundamental breath  Line  Fundamental breath  Alluding to an animal which this profound enquirer into nature discover'd whose organs of respiration are situated in its fundament and which continually swims with its head under water and its tail above for fear of being drown'd A very singular kind of creature it must be own'd and it is presum'd a very clean one As to no other part of its body are assign'd the offices which we should readily suppose were those of the part mentioned  Vide Inspector    In this passage our author like other great writers it must be confess'd doth not pay the strictest regard to historical truth As the monster here spoken of is not said to be engender'd in  small beer  but was the polite inhabitant of  Kensington  Whilst thy grim Lion grinds thy foes to death  Line  Whilst thy grim Lion grinds thy foes to death  Our author seems here to have an eye to a very curious piece of history in the  London Daily Advertiser  of  January  which runs thus  We hear from the  Bedford CoffeeHouse  in  CoventGarden  that an unhappy Gentleman of that neighbourhood having yesterday morning in wantonness thrust his head into the mouth of the Lion that resides there felt the jaws unexpectedly close upon him On this enquiring with a hollow voice whether he shook his tail and being answered in the affirmative he begged the bystanders to pray for him A terrible crash was immediately after heard and notwithstanding the uncommon resisstance of the skull it is credibly reported that the teeth met through it He was immediately after conveyed home but his Surgeons are afraid the wounds will prove mortal  Dr HILL  It is not material to consider how much  wit  or  truth  is in this paragraph if it serves to give the public a great idea of the said Lion  O let my humble verse attention claim  Nor deem the friend beneath the Poet's name  Blest in thy own  inspectatorial  stile  Line  Inspectatorial stile  A manner of writing peculiar to this great man which has so often been imitated by the superficial writers of the present age and which our author seems to speak of as inimitable The reader if any such there be who is unacquainted with this stile will conceive some idea of it from the following specimens Speaking of a little rivulet or ditch he says  The translucent waves coursed one another down the light declivity with an inexpressibly pleasing variety of form and a confused but very soft noise of bubbling lashing and murmuring  among against  and  along  the inequalities and meanders of its rough sides and various hollows  Of a pond he says  The surface of the bason was a polished plane unfurrowed by the least motion unruffled by the gentlest breeze the setting sun threw a glow of pale splendor over one half of it the rest was silent shade    On weeds  c  gather'd to one corner of a ditch  The fresh breeze had blown together into this part of the watery expanse whatever floated  on or near  its surface  How philosophically exact  among against  and  alongon or near  At the same time how poetical and florid  Translucent waves Meanders gentlest breeze the glow of splendor  and  expanse  Hence reader if thou hast perchance seen only the faint imitations of this beautiful stile thou may'st conceive a more correct idea of what our author here so pathetically laments the want of Vide  Inspectors    You nobly scorn to hear the numbers toil  To see them fetter'd down to mood and tense  And groan beneath the infirmity of Sense  Void of Politeness Elegance and Ease  Ah what is  Meaning  when compar'd with these  How then shall I for thee presume to sing  For thee borne high on Fame's tenacious wing  Line  Fame's tenacious wing  In this line appears our author's commendable spirit of modesty in imitating great men This expression being evidently taken from the motto on the  Lord Mayor  's Coach  Pennâ metuente solvi Vide  State Coach of Sir  Crisp Gascoine  Also  Horace  's Ode to  Crisp Sallust  Lost to thy soft harmonious flowing lay  And curs'd to  mean  whene'er I  sing  or  say  Line  And curs'd to mean whene'er I sing or say  Our author here seems whether ironically or no I leave to abler critics to complain of a misfortune which he fears will prevent his success in poetry for no less a critic and poet than the great Mr  Dryden  says  He who servilely creeps after sense  Is safe but ne'er can reach to excellence  Hear then ye daughters of immortal Jove  By the soft vows of your  Inspector  's love  If not too jealous of each other's flame  You slight the lover for a rival's claim  Or if his gallantry superior charms  And all the nine in concert fill his arms  Like his familiar  Daphnes  here below  Blessing at once the Poet and the Beau  Hear and support me in your fav'rite's cause  Inspire my song and crown me with applause  I sing dire faction and the cruel strife  Of Bards that live and Bards that write for life  Line  Of Bards that live and Bards that write for life  I am appriz'd that this line may be taken in a varied sense Some may imagine that by a man's  writing for life  is intended his writing for a  livelihood  and that by Bards that  live  are meant those who live  independent  of writing as it is expressed by this line  These live to write and those must write to live  A kind of distinction which seems to have been handed down from that immortal Philosopher Lord Chancellor  Bacon  who is said to have complained to King  James  the First lest he should be reduced to  study  to  live  rather than  live  to  study  I cannot however think this our author's drift but that by  writing for life  he meant  writing as hard as one can drive  and that he had in his eye that part of the old ballad of the  Wife of Bath  When  Adam  heard her say these words  He ran away for Life  In which case as  Adam  according to the tradition is in Paradise or Heaven he could not be supposed to run to preserve his life so that it is clear our author intended only to convey the eagerness of the pursuit of those Bards who had the measure allow'd he might have said  Write  AWAY  for Life  Of Fidlers Coxcombs Harlequins and Play'rs  Physicians Parsons Fools and dancing Bears  Line  Dancing Bears  The reader is not to take this expression literally or think the poet celebrates real  four legg'd Bears  or that he had any view to the famous  Ursi domestici mirabili  that yielded the  Inspector  an opportunity of being so very witty last summer or to those gentle Bruins that now expose themselves by dancing hornpipes in the streets It is plain he intends no more by the word  Bear  than as Sir ALEXANDER DRAWCANSIR has defin'd that appellation in his compleat Modern Glossary  Beara Country Gentleman or any creature on  TWO  legs that does not make a good bow  COVENTGARDEN JOURNAL No  Neither doth our author proceed only on  precedent  having also philosophical authority For  Carolus Linnaeus Suecus  whom I must own I have never read  The first of natural philosophers as the world with justice stiles him and as he calls himself  Dioscorides Secundus  in his  Systema Naturae  declares that the Man and Bear differ only as two species of the same genus He establishes in that work one of his Genera under the name of  Anthropomorphae  that is creatures having the human form and comprehends under it the  Bear  the  Man  and the  Monkey  HILL  Immortal  Dulness  honour'd on her throne  Beheld her Empire spreading

Ancients as it is impossible he should himself be so ignorant and very unlikely the learned personage he addresses should know no better since he himself remarks on illiterate scribblers  We shall see the modern Essayist who has hardly Grammar enough to arrive at Concord larding every other sentence with some transcript from an author it is impossible he should have read not because it is necessary but because it is  Greek  for what he has been saying in  English  It is true a certain writer who pretended to take off or copy the Doctor's writings exactly did quote  Lilly  and paum'd the passage upon  Virgil  but it is impossible to suppose an author who could censure others in the manner abovequoted should be guilty of such forgery  SCHOLIAST  Thy  Ainsworth Bailey  and thy wellthumb'd

Fielding Machiavel  or  Brown    Line  Machiavel or Brown  Our author seems here to hint at the plot carried on last summer at  Ranelagh  in which Mr  Brown  was the principal person concerned Hear the account of the diligence used in detecting the Contrivers  Warrants were issued out on  Wednesday  night from Mr Justice  Lediard  and early on  Thursday  morning from the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor for apprehending all the persons concerned with  Mr Brown  in the assault upon Dr  Hill  on  Wednesday  night in the passage at  Ranelagh  The officers have been ever since in search after them but none of them are yet taken Yesterday at noon the  Marshals  of the  Lord Mayor  entered the Chambers which some Gentleman had lent to  Brown  in the Temple But he escaped the search by concealing himself in a Coalhole About ten last night he was seen to go out mussled up in a great coat and with a handkerchief tied over his face Notice was immediately sent to the city and the proper officers are posted to wait his return The servants of the chambers while he lay in the Coalhole pretended he had early made his escape and was by that time far enough out of reach Such measures are now taken that it will not be easy either for him or any of the rest to get off unless they have already anticipated the sentence of the law by a voluntary banishment It would be well if the Police of  Paris  were imitated here and accounts were taken of those who make the appearance or something which they intend shall be like the Appearance of Gentlemen with no visible way of living  Hll  There were some people however who knowing the consequence of this illustrious personage imagined the scheme for depriving this kingdom of his pen and services much deeper laid than was generally thought and that notwithstanding the trivial pretence of a private quarrel the politicians of the  F  nch  King's cabinet were no strangers to the process of this plot This will appear very plausible if we reflect how on a particular occasion the great Mr  Dennis  was disturbed by a  French  p  teer hovering about the coast of  Sussex  in order to take him for writing a pamphlet against the interest of that Court How the Doctor was offended at his Christian Majesty or whether it be not out of envy to this kingdom itself that this plot was laid against its InspectorGeneral I can't determine

taken before a man's own handwriting Dr  H  is accused of being a great liar nay this opinion has so far prevailed that his own acknowledgment of finding himself in an error has been thus censured in an Epigram  What  Hll  one day says he the next does deny  And candidly tells you'tis all a damn'd lie  Dear Doctorthis candour from you is not wanted  For why shou'd you own it'tis taken for granted  Now the Doctor himself says  There is no Vice so universally detested as falsehood  and takes for the Motto of his paper  Juvenal's confession I know not how to tell a Lie  Surely surely those who
