 A SHORT HISTORY OF THE OPPOSITION DURING THE Last Session of Parliament  DUBLIN PRINTED FOR THE COMPANY OF BOOKSELLERS MDCCLXXIX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE present situation of Public Affairs calls forcibly upon every good Subject to exert himself in the Public Service Every individual possesses a power which can aid and support his country He can draw his sword in her defence contribute to her resources or combat with argument and expose to just indignation those who have proved themselves her internal and consequently her unnatural enemies  The Author of the following Essay has long entertained an opinion that the most formidable foes of Great Britain were nursed in her own bosom These under the masque of Patriotism fomented rebellion in her Colonies and by exposing her pretended weakness created a combination of powerful States not only against her interest but her very existence as a great and independent Kingdom  In the emergency which is the result of that combination two objects seem necessary to the  Public Safety These are the knowledge of our friends from our enemies and that spirited exertion which alone can extricate us from our present situation If the facts advanced and encouragements exhibited in the following Essay shall contribute to throw light on the one or to add vigour to the other the Writer has attained his purpose  A SHORT HISTORY OF THE OPPOSITION  IN every age and almost in every country the ambition which is inherent in human nature has prompted individuals to aspire to distinction and preeminence among their fellowcitizens The means used to obtain those objects are various as to render them successful they must be accommodated to the spirit of the government under which they are applied In despotic monarchies the favour of the Prince who is the fountain of all preferment is generally procured by intrigue or address In republics influence and authority are acquired by gaining the confidence or by seducing the principles of the people and in mixed governments like that of Great Britain  the nearest road to power lies between those two extremes  The Revolution which happened about ninety years ago though it made but few changes in the forms of authority established a balance of influence between the Crown and the People The first retained the essence but lost much of the terror of power The representatives of the latter having a great deal to bestow as a body thought themselves as individuals entitled to a share in a government which they supported A mutual dependence was created by the possession of the means of conferring mutual favours A Prince who stood in need of supplies was directed by common prudence where to chuse his servants But as candidates were more numerous than offices the disappointed never failed to persecute the successful till by watching faults errors or misfortunes they obtained their point and they themselves became in their turn the objects of attack  As a degree of the public confidence was necessary to direct the Sovereign in his choice of servants men who wished to be employed took care to support in their public appearances the principles and perhaps the prejudices of the people An habitual jealousy of the power  of the Crown kept open the ears of the public to every alarm Scarce any measure of Government could be so free from error as not to be vulnerable on some popular ground Every Opposition seized this obvious advantage and assumed or obtained the title of "the popular party" No distinction was made in this respect between  Whig  and  Tory  Each party when out of place adopted the same principles and thus both were alternately dignified with the once honourable name of PATRIOTS  The present reign began with advantages calculated to put an end to foolish distinctions which ought to have expired with the prejudices on which they had been founded A young prince had succeeded to the throne who disdained to govern his people through the medium of a faction The door of preferment was laid open to all his subjects but though this liberal conduct might have pleased the unprejudiced it was incapable of extinguishing party among the interested These though of different principles and characters by imposing on the weak and credulous formed new factions on the shadows of departed political tenets However heterogeneous before the heat of resentment and rage of disappointment as it were gradually melted them into one mass  and they revived in themselves the name though little of the principles of WHIGS  The vehemence of the present Opposition seems to have carried them to extremities which supersede all former descriptions of party and which cannot fail to defeat their views In former times the candidates for public favour thought it prudent to adhere in their exhibitions to public principles But in our times an eagerness to thwart the measures of Government has expelled all regard for the opinions of the people The dignity and honour of the nation were formerly the favourite themes of Oppositions melancholy meanness and despair now fill the whole circle of patriotic oratory With a want of prudence as well as of decency they tie up the hands of their country in the hour of danger They not only justify rebellion against her authority but indirectly promote a foreign war against her very existence By magnifying the power of her opponents they endeavour to depress her spirits by exposing her real or pretended weakness they wish to inspire her enemies with a confidence of success  These strange positions and many more of the same kind might be established on incontestible authorities by a plain narrative of the  conduct of opposition since the commencement of the present parliament But the pursuing them through such a variety of matter and such a length of time would be a task of great labour and little entertainment We shall therefore confine ourselves to the most striking features of the last session In the space of seven months they have contrived to croud together most of the absurdities of seven years and though the studied brevity of this disquisition must necessarily exclude many circumstances enough we trust will appear to shew the principles designs and views of so strange a confederacy  On the th of November the fifth session of the present parliament was opened with a speech from the throne A complaint of the perfidy of France in commencing hostilities and the obstinacy of America in refusing terms together with a request of support were the chief heads of the speech It expressed at the same time a regret "that the efforts of his Majesty had not been attended with all the success which the justice of the cause and the vigour of exertions seemed to promise" Unanimity was in the usual form recommended and surely no period in history more required the unanimous exertion of the whole nation  Opposition have denominated themselves "an active Opposition" and if zeal in thwarting assiduity in obstructing and success in defeating public measures merit a designation which implies a kind of applause they are certainly entitled to that name The unanimity and concert which their Sovereign requested for the support of the interests and honour of the nation exist only among them for the ruin of the one and the tarnishing of the other A short detail of the principles which they advanced in the first exhibitions of the season will establish the truth of this observation The orators in the Lower House mixed reflections on the past with prophecies of future disasters The first we shall submit to the judgment of the Reader several of the latter have been already refuted by time  Opposition opened the political campaign with assertions which had been often refuted and with predictions of national disasters which their own conduct seemed uniformly calculated to realize As the public misfortunes may be deduced from the rebellion in America they asserted contrary to fact that hostilities had been first commenced by government They recurred to their usual prophecies relative to foreign wars and they even went so far as to arm Holland our ancient ally against this devoted  kingdom  Mr T T  d's Speech Nov th  To sow discontents among the militia they alleged that the officers had been scandalously neglected  Speech of T T  d Nov  To excite mutiny in the army and navy they asserted that Government had employed no commander of an army no admiral of a fleet whom they had not disgraced or with whom they had not quarrelled  Speech of C F  x Nov Speech of C  l B  e  With a contradiction in terms which neither folly nor rage itself could justify they averred that Ministry had succeeded in  no instance  yet that fortune had been favourable in  every instance  during the whole campaign  Ibid  They owned that unanimity was absolutely necessary for the safety of their country yet with peculiar  honesty  avowed "that they would clog the wheels of government when it ought to be assisted by every man  Ibid  "  Though the clogging the wheels of Government at home and their encouraging the seditious abroad had been the obvious cause of the rise and progress of the American war they traced the cause of the war to the pretended tyranny of GreatBritain  Ibid  Though America had continued an atrocious rebellion for many years  against her parent and benefactress yet they affirmed that a war against America "is against our own country" Though the Americans have been declared  rebels  by all the solemnity of law by all the forms of the constitution "they are still our fellowsubjects and every blow we strike is against ourselves  Speech of C F  x Nov Speech of C  l B  e  " Though they have broke capitulations  Governor J  st  ne's Speech Nov  disregarded flags of truce  Admiral Gambier's Letter to Congress  violated conventions trampled on every principle of war that governs civilized nations  Speech of Governor J  st  ne  "yet as their war is a war of passion  Speech of Mr F  x Nov  " we ought "to withdraw our forces entirely from their coast  Ibid  " Though "offensive war is pointed out as proper for this country  Ibid  " war ought not "to be offensive with respect to America" With unexampled absurdity they alleged that rebels in arms had a better right to "a relaxation of hostilities" than foreign enemies whom the alliance of those rebels had excited against their country With a perversion of terms unknown in any other times they asserted that men whose hands are daily stained with the blood of their countrymen  ought to be treated not as enemies but as peaceable fellowsubjects and friends  Speeches of all the Opposition    In the Upper Assembly the zeal of Patriotism as springing from higher ground rose to a greater height Not content to amend the Address to the Throne it was insisted that no Address at all should be made  L  d B  l's Speech Nov  It was asserted that our armies were either mouldered away by death desertion and sickness or reduced by loss in battle  L  d C  y's Speech Nov  That our commerce was totally lost our public credit drawing to annihilation our fleet on the verge of absolute ruin  L  d B  l's Speech  That nothing could save the empire but withdrawing our troops from America acknowledging her independence and imploring her forgiveness  Vide Opposition Speeches  passim  That it would be even imprudent if not impossible to persist in a war against France  B  p of P  rb  gh's Speech  That Spain would aid France that Holland as a commercial state would treat with America that the whole world would join against us that we were without men without money without an ally that nothing in short could  save the state but an immediate dismission of all his Majesty's present servants and the placing the reins of Government in the hands of Opposition  Speeches  passim  Nov  Assertions which carried along with them their own refutation were not likely to make converts within nor proselytes without doors But what the party could not effect by facts and arguments they endeavoured to accomplish by address and intrigue Mismanagements and a consequent want of suceess on every side of the war had convinced the nation that there was an error in planning at home or a defect in the execution abroad Generals and Admirals had returned from their different commands not only without laurels but some of them covered with disgrace or misfortune The coldness with which they had been received by their country had raised their resentment as it hurt their pride As Government brought forward no accusation against them the presumption was that they themselves were partly to blame As men of little prudence and considerable names are the fittest tools for the hands of party Opposition took care to secure engines which they hoped to play off with advantage on the enemy  G  l B  ne though a man spirit of conducted himself as if political prudence formed no part of his character His enemies remarked that he came from America where he had lost an army with as much confidence as Terentius Varro returned to Rome from the fatal fields of Cannae Men in general have less blamed his conduct abroad than his behaviour at home His accepting a leave of absence from a Congress who had shamefully evaded hs own convention the remembrance of recent misfortunes and a suspicion of former errors justified the court in adhering to an  etiquette  which excludes officers who have been unfortunate from the Royal Presence till they are acquitted by a Court Martial  The General forgot his own errors if such existed and remembered only what he thought the severity of Government He also forgot that he had left his captive fellowsoldiers whom he ought to have protected from insult and oppression by his presence and he even eluded orders given him to return to their aid in their melancholy and severe captivity It was observed upon the whole that regret and pity were all he could hope to meet with but it seems he expected approbation Resentment arose in his mind as from injustice  and with a precipitancy which cannot easily be defended he either sought or accepted the protection of Opposition  Sir W  H  e had indeed lost no army but as he had decisively improved no advantage the American war rather increased than diminished upon his hands Possessed of the common  routine  of military knowledge he seems to have been capable of securing from defeat  such  troops as  be  led against  such  an enemy But the conducting them to any brilliant victory and the making a decisive use of the superiority he enjoyed appear to have been objects foreign to his talents Sensible perhaps of this defect in his own mind he chose to prevent any reverie of fortune by retiring from the command of the army but as "military secessions" in the midst of war require an explanation his retreat was ascribed to his having lost the confidence of men in power The fact might be true but it was not sufficient to satisfy the people Though he was received with kindness by the Sovereign and attention by the Ministry he perceived that he was vanishing fast from the memory of the nation In the space of a few months he found himself of as little account in the estimation of the Public as any of his own commissaries  and to recover his reputation he closed eagerly with Opposition as they promised him their hearty assistance in a Parliamentary Inquiry  To these lucky aids from America the party added a still greater acquisition in Europe An Admiral possessed of professional reputation equal at least to his merit though connected with Opposition was placed at the head of the Western Squadron The selecting men of  opposing  principles for the command of fleets and armies has been long a favourite maxim of Government This conduct may have had its foundation in liberal sentiments but it has operated like weakness and led to a train of misfortunes Few officers are such "sturdy moralists" as to exclude political prejudices from the line of their duty  Our Admiral put to sea with one of the most powerful squadrons that ever sailed from the ports of this kingdom He met the enemy and a running fight rather than an engagement ensued No trophies were lost but no laurels were gained The professional terms in which the accounts of naval actions are involved render them obscure if not unintelligible  to the generality of mankind One fact however was universally admitted "A superior British fleet had engaged an inferior French squadron and neither advantage nor trophy was obtained"  A nation accustomed to value themselves upon naval victories were not likely to be satisfied with a drawn battle under such circumstances But though no symptoms of approbation appeared no signs of resentment were shown A cold silence certainly prevailed a species of censure more mortifying to a feeling mind than even clamour Had the Admiral been permitted to remain under this cloud he would have become a useless engine in the hands of his party To derive benefit from his former popularity it was found necessary to remove the stain which want of success had left upon his character Some officers in his suite were accordingly induced to propagate insinuations to the disadvantage of ViceAdmiral Sir H  P  r That gentleman by being in place might be supposed to act in concert with men in power for the ruin of his Admiral and to make the former the  accuser  was to arm the prejudices of the people in favour of the latter  The Vice Admiral being a man of more spirit than foresight unfortunately fell into the trap laid for him by the faction Conscious of his deserving praise instead of censure for his behaviour on the th of July he became irritated at the injustice done to his reputation From being the  accused  he became the  accuser  and this step turned the scale of opinion in favour of his opponent In this circumstance alone the gallant ViceAdmiral as it afterwards appeared was to blame Had he demanded and insisted upon his own trial his character would have recovered its deserved lustre and that of the Admiral might have lost much of that splendour which was thrown upon it by his industrious friends  A party who had lost the confidence of the nation seized with eagerness the sudden change which appeared in the popular tide Whispers artfully propagated without doors were improved by degrees into a general clamour Within doors every opportunity was taken and every artifice used to feed the rising flame The two Admirals if a vulgar expression may be used were  pitted  against each other Much sport or what is the same thing to Opposition much mischief was expected from this contest A man of popularity was accused by a man  in office The common changes of ministerial interference were rung without ceasing in the ears of the people The helpless condition of INNOCENCE when persecuted by POWER was echoed from every corner by the runners writers and abettors of Opposition The two houses of Parliament resounded with vehement declamations or broken accents of whining oratory and that amiable but much abused virtue pity was excited every where in the breasts of the deluded the credulous and the weak  In vain had Sir H  P  r declared in the most solemn and public manner that he had not communicated his design to any man in office In vain did men in office affirm upon the faith of Gentlemen that they knew nothing of the accusation till it was officially delivered to the Admiralty No credit was to be given to any member of a  Tory  Administration They were leagued together in one plan of oppression in one dark design in one preconcerted conspiracy to ruin the reputation and even to take the life of a  Whig  Admiral  In this general turmoil this intemperate joy of faction Opposition not only forgot their poor country but even their poor  friends Sir W  H  could not gain their promised support for a moment with all the verdure of his laurels The advantages hoped from his exculpation were not equal in themselves and they were more distant in prospect than the benefits to be drived from the acquittal of Admiral K  l In vain did General B  ne endeavour to awake the pity of the party when he failed to command their attention In vain did he exclaim "that he was  one  of those brave men who made the convention at Saratoga That however he claimed no single  merit  in that transaction that in the face of famine despair and death he had compelled the enemy to grant conditions honourable if they had been complied with  Almon's Debates No XI p  " The party were deaf to "the tale of tears" and all the attention paid to the unfortunate general scarce amounted to one "dolorous anhelation  Vide Dr Johnson on the Irish Howl p  " from the feeling bosom of Mr E  d B  ke  The conduct of Opposition during the trial and after the acquittal of A  l K  l is too recent in the recollection of the public to require more than a very general recapitulation  Their abrogating the old forms of the Admiralty by removing a trial for a naval offence to the land to accommodate their own purposes their appearance at Portsmouth upon the occasion their biassing witnesses their carrying all the indecencies of a playhouse audience into a Court of Justice their soliciting the officers of the navy their sowing discontents among the common seamen their parading the streets for the purpose of inflaming the populace were such mean scandalous and unjustifiable tricks of faction as can scarcely be paralleled by any example in history  The pitiful victory which they obtained over an unfortunate because a vehement man was pursued with an intemperance inexcusable even in boys and with a rancour which the most profligate and hardhearted men if prudent would have concealed to preserve at least the appearance of decency That men of the first families in this country should disguise themselves like porters to force illuminations by breaking windows is a circumstance which throws an indelible stain upon the times as well as on the party It even appeared that with every inclination to commit mischief the riotous demagogues were obliged to have recourse to the bottle for that courage which nature  had denied That in the hour of "intoxication and adscititious boldness" they attacked the feeble and old among the men and terrified into fits and miscarriages several women by the rude barbarity of their behaviour That however as a just retribution for their wanton cruelties many of them suffered under the hands and cudgels of the injured and that several were carried into Roundhouses covered with ignominious marks of the chastisement they had received  Few men of sense who were not connected with the views or privy to the designs of the party could perceive any just grounds for this species of vulgar ovation Though the  accuser  had not brought his charges to the standard of legal proof the  accused  had not exculpated himself to the satisfaction of the public Those who were most willing to deny his want of conduct regretted his want of good fortune and a general cry went forth that an opportunity was lost which might never return again  The conduct of the Admiral himself on the occasion was not calculated to establish any high idea of his good sense or of his principles If he thought that he merited a triumph for the drawn battle of the th of July what  are we to think of his understanding If on the other hand he made himself the tool of a faction what judgment must we form of that "dignified honour" which his friends annex to his character A victory which had lain concealed for seven months and was at length discovered by accident was not intrinsically worth the expence of many candles and the applause of a mob is the coarsest commodity either a gentleman or his friends can purchase  But the Faction as well as their naval friend acted as if they really gave credit to their own assertions and assumptions Whilst HE paraded the streets amidst the foolish if not hired acclamations of a rabble THEY were busy in weaving a wreath for his brows in both Houses of Parliament Thinking at length they had sufficiently charged the engine with popularity they resolved to bring it to bear not only upon Administration but upon their Sovereign  They  proposed to make motions against the former on naval subjects  he  undertook with peculiar modesty to write  rescripts  to the latter Even before this double battery was opened Opposition began to preenjoy their expected success with that childish intemperance which has uniformly marked their conduct  A  l K  l having acquired in the beginning of March as many laurels as he was likely to obtain his honourable relation Mr F  x introduced the first of a long string of motions which he owned led to an address for the removal of the first Lord of the Admiralty and ultimately of all his Majesty's servants  Mr F  x's Speech March d and th  In support of the motion he alleged that the noble Lord who presided over the naval department had as early as the month of November solemnly pledged himself in his official capacity that there were thirty five ships of the line ready for sea and fit for actual service That notwithstanding this assertion there were not six ships of the line in a state to meet an enemy in the month of March That early in the month of June his honourable relation  Admiral Keppel  was sent to cruize on the coast of France with twenty ships of the line only though it was known or ought to have been known that there were twentyseven ships of force lying in Brest water From these supposed facts he deduced this conclusion that the Ministry who had led the nation into so perilous a situation ought instantly to be removed  as unequal to the trust committed to their charge  Crime enorme aux yeux du  Sieur Fox  Gazette de France du Vendredi Mars    In opposition to these assertions it was proved from official documents that in November there were actually thirtyfive ships of the line ready for service That in the month of March some more ships were in a state of great forwardness for sea That the whole number fit for meeting an enemy in June amounted to fortyfour That when Mr K  l was ordered to sail with twenty ships of the line of which a large proportion was threedeckers there were but seventeen ships in the harbour of Brest ready for action That should it even appear which was by no means the case that there actually was a greater number of ships in Brest it was well known to seamen that an inferior force may block up a superior one in a narrow harbour That upon the whole the Board of Admiralty had placed a number of ships adequate to the service under the command of A  l K  l even to the satisfaction and approbation of the Admiral himself That therefore as the premises endeavoured to be established by Opposition were not founded in  fact their conclusions must of course fall to the ground  Lord M  ve's Speech March d and th    Such were the assertions which Opposition mixed with much abuse and altercation repeatedly echoed from side to side in both Houses Though the public as well as Parliament are frequently invited to an entertainment of politics by some very  eloquent  Patriots the dish served up is always the same To use their own expression "they have travelled so often over the ground" that they have trod out every appearance of vegetation and those who are so idle as to accompany them in the "dreary journey" can neither expect amusement nor reap advantage  The operations of the party  without  doors were more decisive than their arguments  within  Confident of success or assuming the appearance of confidence they had previously gained the votes of several provident members who  wisely  look into futurity Lazy Whigs and expecting patriots were roundly told that to share in the spoil it was necessary to take an active part in obtaining the victory Mandates were issued for the immediate appearance of all  absentees from every corner of the kingdom The beds of the sick the couches of the gouty and lame were visited leaders were sent to the blind In short patriotism crowded the lobbies of both Houses with all the mortifying pictures of age misfortune and disease  To aid with a species of mutiny among seamen the attacks of Opposition upon Admiralty the seeds of sedition had been sown with a lavish hand at Portsmouth Officers had been attacked through their ruling passions the vain with flattery the weak with fallacious reasonings and the avaricious and ambitious with promises To add indecency to presumption and folly the nation was  threatened  with what is vulgarly called a  Round Robin  from every seaport An Admiral who had made such a  splendid  figure on the th of July dared to say to his sovereign that he would withdraw his talents from the service unless the Admiralty and every department of the State were placed in the hands of men whom he could trust  Opposition drove with so much rapidity and so little judgment that they overturned their own designs Their mean and even criminal conduct offended the people and the Sovereign  with becoming dignity rejected their insolent requisitions The current turned against them and their spirit vanished when their hopes declined The nation discovered their insidious designs their lust for power their thirst for places It was perceived that they meant to sacrifice Great Britain her rights her interests and even honour to the demagogues of America by rendering her independent of the parent from whom she sprung Even those who had been seduced by their assurances or gained by their promises finding their mistake began to retreat The friends whom they had brought from the country by a species of  habeas corpus  packed up their cloakbags and left the town The beds of the sick and couches of the lame were reoccupied and even the blind found their way home Ad  l K  l executed his threats against his  devoted  country by quitting her service The muddy stream which had overflowed the whole kingdom and covered it with slime returned to its old bed and babbled as formerly through the rugged channel of Opposition  The  Gazette de France    du Vendredi    Mars  with a kind of regret says Aupres touts ces débats le voix etant recueillés la motion de  Sieur Fox  n'en eut que contre    The hopes of the Faction had been raised so high that disappointment depressed their minds in proportion to their former elevation Some who either ignorantly or fondly imagined that the nation would take their part began to talk of a secession A few orators are said to have actually retired to vent the tropes of unfinished speeches to the "echo of trees and murmur of rills" on some friend's estate  A certain Baronet who in a fit of despair relative to the good  Old Cause  has lately become a zealous  Whig  is much given to such solitary  rehearsals  of the Speeches which he intends to  fire off  upon the House  But as "listless groves and insensible streams" are not the most encouraging audiences the solitary patriots were induced to rejoin their friends who though defeated still remained in the field  Whilst the expectations of Opposition were at their height by the aid received from A  l K  l's acquittal a new topic was started which as it promised much mischief to their country opened a fresh prospect of advantage to the party The trade of Ireland and consequently its revenue had been on the decline for some years past The causes of that misfortune are more difficult to ascertain than the fact itself Whether this diminution of commerce  proceeded from a decrease of the domestic industry or a failure of foreign markets it equally demanded a remedy if it could be applied Some steps had been accordingly taken toward that object in the preceding session But it appeared at the time that the facility with which relief was granted instead of satisfying Opposition was calculated to create new demands These demands as they interfered with the commerce of Great Britain were certain of being opposed a circumstance which could not fail to create the  desirable  confusion which suits the views of the party  To those who really wished to remove the evil it appeared that the Irish legislature ought to be the best judges of the remedy But neither that legislature nor their constituents had signified any dissatisfaction at the relief obtained To convince both of the impropriety of their  peaceable  conduct Opposition by making demands in the name of Ireland pointed out what she might extort from Great Britain This artifice they hoped would reduce the Ministry to a disagreeable dilemma Should they grant the demanded relief to the Irish they could not fail to offend the whole commercial interest in great Britain should they refuse it there was a prospect by proper management  of creating tumults and perhaps of kindling a rebellion in Ireland  Though this commercial adventure has not yet been productive of all the profit expected by the Faction as the ship is still at sea the cargo may turn out to some account The inferior Irish are and have been in a distressed situation The nature of the government the tenures of the country a listless inactivity which always accompanies distress a want of industry created by domestic discouragements of various kinds have combined to render their condition more wretched than that of almost any other in Europe They have long felt their own misery without knowing well from whence it came Our worthy Patriots by pointing out Great Britain as the author of Irish distress may have some chance of rousing Irish resentment They have fomented and encouraged resistance in America and why may they not excite rebellion in Ireland The truth is they seem to have injured their country beyond  their  degree of forgiveness and if they cannot satisfy their ambition by her misfortunes they are at least resolved to gratify their resentment by her ruin  The attacks in both Houses were so similar in manner assertion declamation and invective  that it was apparent every measure had been weighed and preconcerted in the cabinet of sedition without doors In this political warfare the post of honour was given to the Patriots of the Lower Assembly where the enemy was supposed to be most vulnerable After the battle was lost  below  it was generally rehearsed  above  where some noble orators wielded with peculiar dexterity those very weapons of scurrility and invective which had so little availed the cause in the hands of their more humble friends  In the slightest skirmishes with the common enemy the same cooperation the same concert appeared Though composed of such discordant members the whole party played in unison and every key that was touched below was faithfully answered by a similar note from above  The Irish business seemed to promise such a plentiful harvest of confusion that the whole party employed their joint labour in preparing the soil and sowing the feed Individuals were not in the mean time idle in their separate efforts for the benefit of the common cause The D  of R  d with his usual application tenacity and vehemence had introduced and supported in the  Upper House an Inquiry into the Magagement of Greenwich Hospital The nature and fate of this Inquiry are so recent in the memory of the Public that a particular detail is as unnecessary in itself as it would be here out of place  It may be sufficient to observe that the intention of the enquiry was to criminate the first Lord of the Admiralty That after a most tedious examination which lasted near three months not one of the charges was proved That the E of S  ch instead of meriting censure deserved the highest praise That he had paid peculiar and uncommon attention to the hospital That he had improved its revenue increased the number of the pensioners prevented the admission of improper objects made new regulations for the more speedy recovery of the sick and the better accommodation of those in health That instead of converting his superintendency of the charity to any advantage he had abolished all sinecures of inferior offices which had formerly been in the disposal of the first Lord That in direct opposition to what had been alledged there is not one out of pensioners at present in the Hospital who is not intitled to the charity by length of service or infirmities contracted in the discharge of duty  Whilst the D of R  d derived some hopes to the faction from the expected issue of the Hospital Inquiry a more flattering prospect of criminating men in office was opened in the Lower Assembly Sir W  H  we though not publicly accused was still anxious to exculpate himself to the Public Either swayed by a good opinion of his own conduct or trusting to the kind partiality of his friends he had flattered the Patriots and perhaps himself that he should be able to lay the burden of American misfortunes to the account of the minister for the American department The nation found itself disappointed but till matters were examined it was not known decidedly where censure ought to fall An unwillingness in Government to admit of a Parliamentary Inquiry on a military subject furnished their enemies with an opportunity of drawing conclusions unfavourable to Ministry These conclusions in the usual manner became topics of patriotic invective and declamation which in a manner extorted an inquiry that had been once refused by a vote  But the result of the Inquiry was very different from what Opposition hoped It appeared that rebellion first arose in America from an ambitious  faction and not from the general sense of the body of the people  Evidence of Major General Robertson before the House of Commons June MS p  That the reduction of that faction and consequently the extinction of rebellion had uniformly been the object of Administration and not the conquest or unconditional subjection of the colonies  The object of the war was to enable the loyal subjects of America to get free from the tyranny of the rebels and to let the country follow its  inclination  by returning to the king's government  Evidence    June  p No idea of subduing the Americansbut to assist the  good Americans  to subdue the  bad ones Ibid  p  That to accomplish that desirable end they had not only sent a force sufficient for the purpose but a much greater one than was either wished for or expected by the most sanguine friend of Government in America  Ibid  p "The demand of men was thought to be rather extravagant"  Ibid  p "The force we had was  adequate  to the subduing the rebellion"  Evidence  June p  That the army had been amply provided on all occasions with every necessary every implement every resource of war That the hands of the General had been so far from being tied up by instructions or his operations counteracted by orders from home that the manner of carrying on the war had been left entirely to his judgment and discretion  It appeared that the Americans instead of overpowering by numbers had never together at one place above and consequently had never been so numerous in the field as the army under Sir W  H  we  Evidence June p  That our troops were well disciplined and uniformly made the best and most military appearance  ibid  p  That the enemy were an undisciplined rabble without order without arms without cloathing  "Except the Maryland Regiment who were well cloathed and accoutred"  ibid  p  though by procrastinating the war they attained discipline and acquired military knowledge That upon all occasions the British troops executed their duty with energy bravery and effect That upon no occasion those of America behaved with the spirit firmness and intrepidity of soldiers That the former were victorious in every assault attack and fair battle That the latter obtained no advantage but by stratagem or surprise The inferences deducible from these facts were that the British army were either unskilfully or languidly led or that the natural strength of the country and unanimity of its inhabitants had enabled the Americans to prevent the consequences of losses and disasters in the field  In support of the first position it appeared That the evacuation of Boston had been too long delayed and undertaken at length in an improper season That the retreat to Halifax furnished the rebels with an opportunity of strengthening their force at NewYork That the victory obtained at Longisland might have proved decisive had it been properly pursued  "Some of the troops were going to storm the lines Gen H  we called them backPutnam who had the command of had detached all but But this was not known"  Evidence  June p  That an opportunity of putting an end to the war had been lost

knew the nature nor the language of the country in a post liable to surprise and attack the giving the command to an Officer whom an habitual intemperance had rendered unfit for the discharge of his duty by presenting an unexpected opportunity to a ruined and dispersed enemy  Who had dwindled to men G Robertson's Evidence June p  encouraged them to reassemble and enabled them to obtain an advantage which turned the scale of the war That the operations which followed this disaster were  less calculated to retrieve the misfortune than to encourage the enemy That the retreat from Quibbleton  "Our army in the Jerseys in was men that of the rebels some said some and some men in that camp"  Evidence  June p "We had men in North America of those Sir W Howe had under his command "  Ibid  June p  the embarkation of the troops the tedious expedition to the Delaware and then to ChesapeakBay the neglecting to improve the victory obtained at the Brandywine the surprise at German Town the injudicious manner of assaulting RedBank and attacking MudIsland the inactive winter at Philadelphia if not proofs of incapacity were instances of blameable inactivity in the General  With regard to the strength of the country it appeared that it presented no advantages to the natives which it did not hold forth to the invaders That on the contrary it was rather more favourable to the latter than to the former That its great rivers instead of covering the retreat of the rebels by being navigable laid them open to fresh misfortunes from an enemy possessing the command of the sea That Hudson's River in particular by dividing the whole continent from North to  South formed a natural and strong barrier between the revolted provinces That the seizing this barrier was an object of the first consequence  Evidence p  towards the extinction of the rebellion That this object might have been easily obtained as the river presents an excellent and expeditious watercommunication between NewYork and Albany  "An army may pass from New York to Albany miles by means of Hudson's River in two days"  Ibid  p  That this great advantage rendered the cooperation of the main army with the troops coming from Canada as obvious as it was easy and expeditious and that it was the want of such cooperation that ruined the Northern expedition  "Many feared that general Burgoyne's army would be lost if not supported by Sir W Howe I wrote myself on being informed of the situation of the different armies I wrote c that if General Burgoyne extricated himself future ages would have little occasion to talk of Hannibal"  Ibid  p  lost an army turned the scale in favour of rebellion and loaded GreatBritain with the expence and danger of a foreign war  In the course of the Evidence taken at home and more especially by the most authentic information from abroad it has appeared that the  injudicious and inactive management of the war has been the sole obstacle to the restoration of peace That a very great majority of the people of America are and have been averse to the measures and disgusted at the tyranny of the Congress  Evidence June p June  passim  That they were prevented from exhibiting their loyalty to their Sovereign and their aversion to usurpation by the desultory manner in which the war was conducted on our part as it deprived them of permanent protection and left them exposed to the insolence cruelty and revenge of their enemies  That the quitting of the Jerseys and the  going to sea  with the whole army in July terrified other provinces from submitting for fear of being deserred That the three Delaware Counties had offered their submission to Government on condition of their being  only assisted  in protecting themselves against the rebels  Evidence June p  That their application having either been disregarded or neglected they adhered to the usurped government That as a general idea had gone abroad that protection was uncertain or rather that desertion was certain  "We soon left the country The rebels took up the signers of addresses banished them or  sent them to the mines  "  Ibid p      the victory at the Brandywine the taking of Philadelphia the destruction of the rebel shipping the reduction of MudIsland and RedBank were attended with none of those advantages which accompany successes in war That no person of great consequence and few of any consequence at all submitted after those events That when a resolution was formed to evacuate Philadelphia such as had submitted were  advised  to make their peace  "Mr Schumacker mentioned to me what he had told me a few days before that Sir William Howe advised him to go over to Washington and make his peace"Mr Galloway's Evidence June p "He Sir William gave me the same advice"  Ibid  p Sir Henry Clinton said "that the game was not up that the war was not over but would still be carried on vigorously and desired that we would not entertain thought of going over to the enemy"  Ibid  p  with the congress That some unfortunate persons who followed that advice fell a sacrifice to the relentless violence and unforgiving tyranny of the rebels That in short the want of protection on the one side and the certainty of punishment for defection on the other eradicated every hope from the minds of the loyal and forced them to swear allegiance to an usurpation which they despised and abhorred  Though these facts came forward with a force which commanded conviction the faction adhered with invincible obstinacy to the line of their former conduct With their usual insult upon the common feelings and common sense of mankind they established false premises and deduced from those premises arguments for the total dereliction and consequently for the dependance of America They affirmed that rebellion can never be extinguished though the want of vigour in pursuing our successes has been the demonstrable cause of its continuing so long They asserted that a general unanimity prevails against Great Britain though the adherence of the people to the congress proceeded from our not affording them a permanent protection under the shelter of our arms They alleged that the courage of the rebels and the natural strength of their country are unsurmountable obstacles though the first seldom appear in the field but to fly and the latter opens every where its bosom to invasion by the means of extensive arms of the sea and many great and navigable rivers  When we deny other public virtues to Opposition we must allow that they possess the negative merit of consistency in their political  conduct They struck one key at the beginning of the American troubles and they have ever since continued the same note or improved upon it as events arose When the tumults began at Boston when licentiousness and riot exhibited their first wild scenes in FaneuilHall they encouraged the piece by applauding the actors The prints of the departing steps of Freedom like those of Astraea were only to be found they affirmed round the  Tree  of  Liberty  on Boston Common A gloomy despotism had seized Great Britain at home and it became necessary that her hands should be settered to prevent the recovery of her authority abroad Every effort on the part of the Mothercountry was an exertion of tyranny every resistance in the colonies was an instance of public virtue The grim tyrant Arbitrary Power had taken up arms against that  innocent  little child American Liberty and to defend the weak against the strong was a service of much reputation and little danger  Obvious as the deceptions held forth by the party  ought  to have been they were attended with success both  without  and  within  doors The people thought that assertions so confidently and so often repeated had some foundation in truth and though Government knew  the contrary they acted as if they gave them credit The consequence was that languid measures were adopted when vigour and exertion were necessary and thus by the forbearance of Administration the encouragement of Opposition the inactivity or inability of commanders that monster REBELLION which should have been stifled as soon as born was fostered and reared to maturity  Unfortunately for this country Opposition were permitted in a manner to take the lead in American measures War and especially rebellion being one of the greatest evils that can afflict a state the most speedy and powerful remedies must be applied to remove the disease The only certain road to peace lies through exertion and victory An anxiety for negociation being generally a mark of weakness too often encourages an enemy to a continuation of resistance It has also a most unfavourable effect on the spirit of the people among whose leaders such anxiety appears This double consideration had rendered the proposing terms a favourite topic of patriotic eloquence To depress the minds of their countrymen to elevate those of the rebels to make the first to doubt the second to become confident of success to keep up if the expression  may be used the ball of contention between the parties were circumstances that probably might lengthen the dispute to the verge of some public misfortune that misfortune if it favoured not the views of ambition might at least be turned to the purposes of revenge  The calamity expected with so much anxiety by Opposition at length arrived An army was lost in America A rebellion which seemed to stagger under partial and illpursued defeats became firmly established by victory The spirits of the country began to sink and the Faction added to the general depression by their unmanly oratory Instead of proposing those vigorous exertions which the honour as well as interest of the nation required they recommended a tame submission to rebels an acknowledgment of former errors and assurances of future amendment The world in general ascribed to artifice a conduct which could not be reconciled to the principles of common sense Was it probable that insurgents who had offered no terms during their misfortunes would receive any in the moment of victory Or could it be expected that a Congress who had declared for independence when thirty thousand disciplined soldiers were ready to land on the coast would  relinquish that independence after they had made a whole army prisoners of war  The most sanguine lovers of tranquility could scarcely derive any hopes from this pacific system but it was adopted The Faction thus obtained that degradation of their own country which seems to have been uniformly a part of their plan But as it had been justly apprehended that American resistance might at last cease through the failure of American resources it had become necessary to procure powerful allies for the support of the cause The defeat and capture of the army under G  l B  ne had certainly its weight in the French cabinet But the deplorable picture given in both Houses of the state of this kingdom could only induce France to throw her weight into the scale of America  The weight of France having been found insufficient in the operations of the last summer the necessity of obtaining  another  ally to the  cause of Liberty  became apparent during the winter Every encouragement and every lure were held out to Spain Under a pretence of bewailing their unfortunate country Opposition exposed her weakness Their own declamations shewed that her councils were distracted by faction and their assertions relative  to the state of her navy and army represented her to foreigners as an easy prey To bring the certainty of her approaching ruin to a point of demonstration some theorists acquainted with figures were employed to make fictitious states of her finances Even some of the party had the folly or rather presumption to assert in public that the very independence of Great Britain was in the power of the house of Bourbon  Contemptible as such assertions may seem at home they make an impression abroad as appears from the  Gazette de France du Vendredi    Juin  "Il soutint que les forces de la France étoient presque egales a celle de la GrandBretagne en Europe et en Amerique que I'Espagne tenoit la balance Il osa prononcer que Il' Angleterre ne domineroit plus sur les mers qu'autant qu'il plairoit à la Maison de Bourbon"L'  eloquent  Burke soutint que le Sieur Hartley avoit rien avancé qui ne fut vrai il appuya cette opinion par un detail circonstancie de toutes les forces del'Espagne    The phlegmatic councils of Spain were however too slow for the fire and vehemence of her British friends Though their eloquence had its proper influence at Madrid that  desirable  circumstance had been concealed in "Castilian taciturnity" Deprived almost of every hope from the other side of the Bay of Biscay the eyes of our Patriots were again turned to the regions beyond the Atlantic As the treaty  attempted last summer had stopt the operations of war it was expedient to throw negotiation in the way of hostility in the present year Though the party had reprobated their  own  measure the conciliatory bills as degrading and disgraceful they proposed the renewal of the commission which those bills authorized This mode of relief or rather respite to rebellion having been refused the old proposal of withdrawing the troops from America was renewed This last effort was also unsuccessful and that melancholy gloom which usually covers the rear of unsuccessful political campaigns began to fall on the party  A sudden though not unexpected light broke through this gloom and revived their drooping spirits Spain being seduced by France and perhaps encouraged by the representations given in our public assemblies of our weakness  Le Sieur Thowsend Fox et Burke furent parmi les opposans ceux qui signalérent davantage contre cette motion en observant que la nation dans l'etat alarmant ou celle se trouvoit s'epuisoit par des dèpenses énormes tandis que chaque jour lui decouvroit quelque nouvelle ennemi que l'Espagne alloit immanquablement se declarer que l'Irlande menacée d'une invasion avoit pris cette circonstance pour se soulever contre le gouvernement Anglois que l'ECOSSE  meme  etoit plein de mècontents Gazette de France du Vendredi Juin  determined to throw her  weight in the scale of our enemies Of  One hundred  injuries which she had received she only specified  two  and proved  none  With peculiar attention to her worthy friends  out  of office she pointed her whole resentment against the British Ministry These men it seems had grievously offended this froward Dame but how or where she could not tell When she has time to recollect the circumstances BUCCARELLI or some other old Spanish acquaintance will no doubt communicate them to C  l B  ré and then we shall know the whole  The uniform conduct of Opposition seemed calculated if not intended to arm Spain in favour of France and America yet they affected a degree of melancholy when that event was announced With a pernicious consistency they dwelt on the weakness of Great Britain and on the force of her enemies Instead of standing forth with that manly boldness which other patriots have either felt or feigned in times of peril they unbraced the nerves of their country with womanish lamentations To magnify the danger they pretended to recommend unanimity and to promife support to the S  n whilst they undermined his just influence and authority But the notes of affected sorrow were soon changed for the voice  of discord and it became apparent that the party lamented their own condition more than the state of their country  In the preceding detail many circumstances are omitted equally descriptive of the conduct and expressive of the designs of Opposition with those that have been related But as the intention of this Essay is only to give a general idea of the subject it was thought unnecessary to descend to every particular One obvious observation will naturally suggest itself to the mind of the Reader That an Opposition begun in ambition has degenerated through disappointment into a species of infinity and that in attempting to ruin the Ministry the party have given a fatal stab to the honour and interests of their country  In every popular government opposition is not only natural but when conducted on liberal principles useful and even necessary There is a kind of charm in authority which may induce the most virtuous magistrates to extend it too far if subject to no controul The original object of a national representative was to watch over the political rights of the executive power The trust is great and strictly speaking ought to be solely appropriated  to the public good Those who use it as an engine of private ambition and personal inrerest meet with forgiveness on account of the frequency of the practice But the employing a weapon given for the defence of our country against its existence is a species of political assassination which no example can justify no state ought to pass without punishment  If the great lines of the conduct of Opposition during the last session of parliament have been fairly traced in the preceding disquisition no terms can be too severe no indignation too violent in exposing the principles and plans of the party If the account which has been given of their assertions and actions has been exaggerated the Public will judge of both with more candour But unfortunately for Great Britain the stamp of truth has been affixed to the representation contained in this Essay by the most uncontrovertible of all arguments the events of the times events unparalleled in the history of any other age or country  Let the consequences of an opposite conduct in the party be considered for a moment Let it be supposed that instead of abetting rebellion and encouraging foreign war they had declared that when the American Congress  avowed Independence and especially when they leagued with France the grounds of the original question were entirely changed That as friends of their country they had resolved to strengthen her hands to restore her authority to protect her interests and to recover her honour That the object of their pursuit had been to render Ministers responsible for remissness in carrying on the war or for obstinacy in refusing adequate and honourable conditions of peace That they had been the first to inquire into the failure of measures in the execution not to assert without examination that the error lay in the cabinet and not in the field That they had taken measures to ascertain by what mismanagement or misconduct in commanders an army had been lost to a contemptible enemy and a superior fleet had returned from action without a victory That instead of receiving into the bosom of their party a general who had quitted his command in the midst of war they had inquired why the advantages he either possessed or obtained had not been more decisively improved  To render still more finished the picture of the reverse of their actual proceedings let it be supposed that instead of announcing to all Europe the weakness of Great Britain they  had in their speeches and their actions exhibited a spirited and disinterested love for their country an unanimity to arm her exertions not to clog her measures a manly boldness to meet to break to disconcert the combinations of her domestic and foreign enemies What would have been in such a case the present situation of public affairs What the state of public opinion relative to themselves The resistance of America must have ceased France might have given up the contest and the junction of Spain would have been prevented  One should suppose it hardly possible that an Opposition consisting of several men whose rank and fortune connect their private interest with that of the public should follow a line of conduct that leads to the destruction of their country and consequently to their own ruin This is an argument which they themselves repeat and think unanswerable The truth is that every faction may avail itself of the same argument but general reasoning must fall to the ground when contradicted by facts There is a pride and obstinacy in party which disdain to acknowledge error and therefore though Opposition may nay must perceive the pernicious tendency of their conduct they choose to persist rather than own a fault  An opportunity offered itself lately which might have reflected credit on Opposition without the supposed disgrace of changing their former opinions The Spanish  Rescript  furnished this opportunity yet the nation cannot see without indignation and astonishment that ACTS indispensably necessary for the safety of the State have been combated with all the virulence and obstinacy of oratory in every stage of their progress That the party clogged every measure for arming the kingdom by sea and land while they asserted that the enemy were ready to invade our coast and that a few days might bring the report of their guns to the ears of both houses of parliament That when a spirit of unanimity and exertion became the duty of all lovers of their country the faction announced with a species of savage triumph that the City of London would not vote a man or a shilling for the national defence in the present emergency That in short they presumed to assert in public that the tyranny of France and Spain would be more welcome to them than the continuance of their rivals in power  After such proofs of aversion to the public good it will be in vain to hope for any reformation in Opposition The distress in which they have involved their country can advance but  one step farther to furnish them with an opportunity of retreating from the line of their misconduct That step is an invasion of this Island the last effort of the conspiracy of our foreign enemies In that critical moment a moment which every good subject would meet with spirit and confidence in his cause there is every reason to fear that Opposition would be still an Opposition Such has been the inveteracy which a consciousness of criminality a jealousy of rivals a habit of opposing the interests and degrading the dignity of their country and a despair embittered by an unpopular and fruitless contest of many years have mixed with every spring of their actions every power of their minds  Upon the whole we may fairly affirm that neither the talents they possess nor the conduct they have pursued are likely to recommend Opposition as proper persons for managing public affairs at the present crisis If our situation is alarming we must look for relief to the resources of the kingdom and the spirit of our countrymen and not to those who have uniformly endeavoured to depreciate the first and to damp the second The truth is that very fortunately for this country this desponding party have hitherto failed in their views of convincing us that our ruin is inevitable  We feel the contrary in the internal vigour of the state and in that unanimity of sentiment among the people which forbids us to connect danger with despair  But why should either be mentioned upon the present occasion This country with much smaller resources and much less unanimity has repeatedly weathered more dreadful storms than those which only  seem  to threaten it at present In the first Dutch war France and Denmark joined the enemy against England  In c  Vide  Life of Clarendon Burnet Rapin Ralph c c  She had no friendly port on the continent from the Pyrenees to the pole no ally but the Bishop of Munster The Dutch came out to a decisive battle with one hundred and thirteen ships of war eleven fireships and seven yatchts led by able experienced and brave commanders France cooperating with her allies entered the Channel with forty ships of the line The usual revenue of England amounted only to the annual sum of one million two hundred thousand pounds and the supplies granted for the year exceeded not double that sum Our standing army scarcely consisted of five thousand men and there was no militia in the kingdom  The nation was in the mean time visited with two of the most dreadful calamities that can afflict a people pestilence and fire Near eighty thousand persons had been carried off by the first in London alone The city had become a kind of desert and grass was observed to grow in the middle of Cheapside  Baker p  The plague followed those who fled to the country and terror and death filled every corner of the kingdom This scourge was followed by a fire which consumed fifteen out of the twentysix wards of the city consisting of four hundred streets and lanes thirteen thousand houses and eightynine parishchurches  Vide Clarendon Heath Burnet  But these misfortunes neither damped the spirits of the people nor obstructed the measures of Government Our fleets though much inferior fought and vanquished the enemy The alliance against us was broken and an honourable and advantageous peace was obtained  In the year the French fleet entered the English channel appeared before Plymouth on the th of June drove the combined fleets of England and Holland from the back of the isle of Wight engaged and totally defeated them in a general battle near Beachyhead  In this unfortunate action we lost eight ships of the line besides many more that were rendered unfit for service and the shattered remains of the fleet were forced to shelter themselves in the Thames  Lord Torrington's Letter July  The French rode triumphant for some months in the Channel They insulted our seaports and threatened our coasts with invasion There were at the time no more than  five thousand  regular troops in England the militia were not arrayed King William was in a manner confined to Ireland by the superiority of the enemy at sea  The nation was at the same time distracted and divided in opinion on account of a disputed succession Public credit during the whole war was so low that soon after this period Exchequer and Navy Bills became almost of as little value as the pasteboard dollars of the American Congress and even the notes of the Bank of England were at  forty per cent  discount  Kennet Ralph Burnet c c  Near  six thousand  trading vessels were taken by the French in the course of the war  Vide Journals of the Commons    Notwithstanding these misfortunes the vigour of Government and spirit of the people surmounted all difficulties  The enemy was disappointed in all his ambitious views an honourable peace was obtained the revolution confirmed the protestant succession secured and public credit restored  In the present times our resources are much greater our spirit equal and our danger less than at either of those periods We have an ample revenue an untainted credit a great and a growing navy Instead of  five thousand  men we have above  sixty thousand  disciplined troops for our internal defence and we have a certain prospect of half as many more in the space of a few months A spirit of unanimity vigour and exertion begins to pervade the whole kingdom Our nobility and gentry with a spirit becoming Britons either serve in our constitutional defence the militia or with their influence and purses exert themselves in raising new corps The greatest commercial society in the kingdom has set a noble example to their fellowsubjects by an unanimous and powerful aid to the state in the present emergency Voluntary subscriptions for raising soldiers and for giving a bounty to sailors have been opened in several places and the same spirit will diffuse itself through both the British isles Such as are debarred by infirmities and  years from personal service will undoubtedly exhibit on the present occasion their love for their country and their zeal for its safety  Instead of being depressed with a sense of danger all ranks and degrees of men feel that elevation which threatened perils excite in generous minds Instead of looking forward to future disgraces or disasters they reflect on the glory of former times The posterity of those who conquered at Poictiers Cressy and Agincourt and annexed France itself to the English crown cannot form to themselves any fears from a French invasion On the contrary when they have sufficiently prepared for security at home they will act offensively abroad and carry back to the bosom of the enemy that terror which he vainly hopes to create  If we are at war in America we have not the burden of a continental war that sink in which our treasure has always disappeared without any hope of return The money laid out on our navy or expended in our Colonies will return to the center of the kingdom through all the veins of commerce Our trade has been protected against the enemy to a degree unknown in any former war We have lost in no quarter of the world any  territory without an equivalent in some we have gained In the West Indies we are still superior to our Enemies We have eradicated them entirely from the East Indies and we have a flattering prospect of a speedy termination of resistance in North America  In the first stage of a war the advantage of attack is possessed by that nation who first breaks the peace The disadvantages of defence must for some time remain with its opponent A state possessing such extensive dominions as Great Britain cannot be supposed to be invulnerable on every side We may suffer some losses at the beginning for what people was ever uniformly successful in war The Romans themselves were not always invincible They frequently lost provinces and armies yet they rose superior to all nations The profits and losses of war can only be estimated on the day which concludes a peace Let us be unanimous among ourselves and that day cannot be distant disadvantageous or dishonourable on the contrary it will be attended with that glory which the spirit and exertion of a great state cannot fail to acquire  THE END
