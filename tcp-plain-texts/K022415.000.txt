OF CARLISLE THIS DISCOURSE IS INSCRIBED WITH SENTIMENTS OF GREAT RESPECT AND GRATITUDE BY HIS LORDSHIP'S MOST DUTIFUL AND MOST OBLIGED SERVANT AND CHAPLAIN W PALEY  PET iii  EVEN AS OUR BELOVED BROTHER PAUL ALSO ACCORDING TO THE WISDOM GIVEN UNTO HIM HATH WRITTEN UNTO YOU AS ALSO IN ALL HIS EPISTLES SPEAKING IN THEM OF THOSE THINGS IN WHICH ARE SOME THINGS HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHICH THEY THAT ARE UNLEARNED AND UNSTABLE WREST AS THEY DO ALSO THE OTHER SCRIPTURES UNTO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION  IT must not be dissembled that there are many real difficulties in the Christian scriptures whilst at the same time more I believe and greater may justly be imputed to certain maxims of interpretation which have obtained authority without reason and are received without enquiryOne of these as I apprehend is the expecting to find in the present circumstances of christianity a meaning for or something answering to every appellation and expression which occurs in scripture or in other words the applying to the personal condition of Christians at this day those titles phrases propositions and arguments which belong solely to the situation of christianity at its first institution  I am aware of an objection which weighs much with many serious tempers namely that to suppose any part of scripture to be inapplicable to us is to suppose a part of scripture to be useless which seems to detract from the perfection we attribute to these oracles of our salvationTo this I can only answer that it would have been one of the strangest things in the world if the writings of the new testament had not like all other books been composed for the apprehension and consequently adapted to the circumstances of the persons they were addressed to and that it would have been equally strange if the great and in many respects the inevitable alterations which have taken place in those circumstances did not vary the application of scripture language  I design in the following discourse to propose some examples of this variation from which you will judge as I proceed of the truth and importance of our general observation  At the time the scriptures were written none were  baptized  but converts and none were converted but from conviction and conviction produced for the most part a corresponding reformation of life and mannersHence  Baptism  was only another name for conversion and conversion was supposed to be sincerein this sense was our Savior's promise "  Mark xvi  he that believeth and is  baptized  shall be saved" and in the same his command to St Paul "  Acts xxii  arise and be  baptized  and wash away thy sins" this was that  baptism  "for the remission of sins" to which St Peter  Acts ii  invited the Jews upon the day of Pentecost that "  washing  of regeneration" by which as St Paul  Titus iii  writes to Titus "he saved us" Now when we come to speak of the  baptism  which obtains in most christian churches at present where no conversion is supposed or  possible it is manifest that if these expressions be applied at all they must be applied with extreme qualification and reserve  The community of christians were at first a handful of men connected amongst themselves by the strictest union and divided from the rest of the world by a real difference of principle and persuasion and what was more observable by many outward peculiarities of worship and behaviorThis society considered collectively and as a  body  were set apart from the rest of mankind for a more gracious dispensation as well as actually distinguished by a superior purity of life and conversationIn this view and in opposition to the unbelieving world they were denominated in scripture by titles of great seeming dignity and importthey were "  Rom viii i  elect" "called" "faints"they were "  viii  in Christ"they were "  Pet ii  a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a "peculiar people"That is these terms were employed to distinguish the professors of christianity from the rest of mankind in the same manner as the names of Greek and Barbarian Jew and Gentile distinguished the people of Greece and Israel from other nations The application of such phrases to the whole  body  of christians is become now obscure partly because it is not easy to conceive of christians as a  body  at all by reason of the extent of their name and numbers and the little visible union that subsists among them and partly because the heathen world with whom they were compared and to which comparison these phrases relate is now ceased or is removed from our observationSupposing therefore these expressions to have a perpetual meaning and either forgetting the original use of them or finding  that  at this time in a  great measure exhausted and insignificant we resort to a sense and an application of them easier it may be to our comprehension but extremely foreign from the design of their authors namely to distinguish individuals amongst us the professors of Christianity from one anotheragreeably to which Idea the most flattering of these names the "elect" "called" "saints" have by bold and unlearned men been appropriated to themselves and their own party with a presumption and conceit injurious to the reputation of our religion amongst "them that are without" and extremely disgusting to the sober part of its professors whereas that such titles were intended in a sense common to all christian converts is well argued from many places in which they occur in which places you may plainly substitute the terms  convert  or  converted  for the strongest of these phrases without any alteration of the author's meaning e g "  Cor vi  dare any of you go to Law before the unjust and not before the saints" "  vii  is any man  called  being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised""  Pet v  the church that is at Babylon  elected  together with you saluteth you""  Rom xvi  salute Andronicus and Junia who were  in Christ  before me"  In opposition to the Jews who were so much offended by the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles St Paul maintains with great industry that it was God Almighty's intention from  the first  to substitute at a fit season into the place of the rejected Israelites a society of men taken indifferently out of all nations under heaven and admitted to be the people of God upon easier and more comprehensive termsthis is expressed in the Epistle to the Ephesians as follows"  Eph i also see Eph iii  having  made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath  purposed in himself  that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ"The scheme of collecting such a society was what God  foreknow  before the foundation of the world was what he did  predestinate  was the  eternal purpose  which he purposed in Christ Jesus and by consequence this society in their collective capacity were the objects of this  foreknowledge predestination  and  purpose  that is in the language of the apostles they were they "  Rom viii  whom he did  foreknow  " they "whom he did  predestinate  "they were "  Eph i  chosen in Christ  before the foundation of the world"they were "  Pet i  elect  according to the  foreknowledge  of God the Father" This doctrine has nothing in it harsh or obscureBut what have we made of itThe rejection of the Jews and the adopting another community into their place composed whilst it was carrying on an object of great magnitude in the attention of the inspired writers who understood and observed itThis event which engaged so much the thoughts of the Apostle is now only read of and hardly thatthe reality and the importance of it are little known or attended toLosing sight therefore of the proper occasion of these expressions yet willing after our fashion to adapt them to ourselves and finding nothing else in our circumstances that suited with them we have learnt at length to apply them to the final destiny of individuals at the day of judgement and upon this foundation has been erected a doctrine which lays the ax at once to the root of all religion that of an absolute appointment to salvation or perdition independent of ourselves or any thing we can do and what is extraordinary those very arguments and expressions  Rom Chap ix x xi which the Apostle employed to vindicate the impartial mercies of God against the narrow and excluding claims of Jewish prejudice have been interpreted to establish a dispensation the most arbitrary and partial that could be devised  The conversion of a grown person from heathenism to christianity which is the case of conversion commonly intended in the epistles was a change of which we have now no just conceptionit was a new name a new language a new society a new faith a new hope a new object of worship a new rule of life a history was disclosed full of discovery and surprise a prospect of futurity was unfolded beyond imagination awful and august the same description applies in a great part though not entirely to the conversion of a Jew This accompanied as it was with the pardon of every former sin Romans iii was such an aera in a man's life so remarkable a period in his recollection such a revolution of every thing that was most important to him as might well admit of those strong figures and significant allusions by which it is described in scriptureit was a "  Tit iii  regeneration  " or a new birthit was to be "  John i iii  born again of God and of the spirit"it was to be "  Rom vi  dead to sin" and" alive from the dead"it was to be "  Col ii  buried with Christ in baptism and raised together with him"it was "  Cor v  a new creature" and "  Eph iv  a new creation"it was a translation from the condition of "  Gal iv  slaves to that of sons"from "  Eph ii  strangers and foreigners to be fellow citizens with the saints and of the houshold of God" It is manifest that no change equal or similar to the conversion of a heathen can be experienced by us or by any  one educated in a christian country and to whom the facts precepts and hopes of christianity have been from his infancy familiaryet we will retain the same languageand what has been the consequence One sort of men observing nothing in the lives of christians corresponding to the magnificence if I may so say of these expressions have been tempted to conclude that the expressions themselves had no foundation in truth and nature or in any thing but the enthusiasm of their authorsOthers again understand these phrases to signify nothing more than that gradual amendment of life and conversation which reason and religion sometimes produce in particular christiansof which interpretation it is truly said that it degrades too much the proper force of language to apply expressions of such energy and import to an event so ordinary in its own nature and which is common to christianity with every other moral institution Lastly a third sort in order to satisfy these expressions to their full extent have imagined to themselves certain perceptible impulses of the Holy Ghost by which in an instant and in a manner no doubt sufficiently extraordinary they are "  regenerate  and  born of the spirit  "they become "  new creatures  "they are made the "  sons of God  " who were before the "  children of wrath  " they are "  freed  from sin" and "from death"they are chosen that is and sealed without a possibility of fall unto final salvationWhilst the patrons of a more sober exposition have been often challenged and sometimes confounded with the questionif such expressions of scripture do not mean  this  what do they mean To which we answernothing nothing that is to usnothing to be found or sought for in the present circumstances of christianity  More examples might be produced in which the unwary use of scripture language has been the occasion of difficulties and mistakesbut I forbearthe present are sufficient to show that it behoves every one who undertakes to explain the scriptures before he determine to whom or what an expression is now a days to be applied to consider diligently whether it admit of any such application at all or whether it is not rather to be restrained to the precise circumstances and occasion for which it was originally composed  I make no apology for addressing this subject to this audience because whatever relates to the interpretation of scripture relates as I conceive to us for if by any light we may cast upon these ancient books we can enable and invite the people to read the Bible for themselves we discharge in my judgement the first duty of our functionever bearing in mind that we are the ministers not of our own same or fancies but of the sincere Gospel of Jesus Christ
