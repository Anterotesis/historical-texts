 The Man's bewitch'd OR The Devil to do about Her A COMEDY As it is Acted at the NEWTHEATRE IN THE HAYMARKET BY HER  MAJESTY  's  SERVANTS    By SUSANNA CENTLIVRE  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT between the Two  TempleGates  in  Fleetstreet    To His GRACE WILLIAM Duke of  Devonshire Lord Steward of Her Majesty's Houshold Lord in  Eyre  North of  Trent  Lord Lieutenant of the County of  Derby  and One of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council  c  May it please your GRACE  THE Muses were ever ambitious of being distinguish'd by shrouding themselves under the Patronage of the greatest Men in all Ages not made so by Titles or Preferment but such whose innate Principles of Honour truly supported those their Prince had crown'd them with From hence sprung my Presumption of laying the following Scenes at Your Grace's Feet since the World must allow that all those Virtues which compleat a perfect good as well as great Man are  center'd in the Duke of  Devonshire  the loyalest Subject the tenderest Husband and the kindest Master that ever Monarch Wife or Servant had Briliant Graces but such as do not shine in every Man of Quality From such Patriots what may not  Britain  hope Nay what might not She command were all her Sons as fervent for her Interest and discharg'd their respective Trusts with that Fidelity and due Regard to the publick Good as Your Grace has ever done in Yours Then the hated Name of Faction wou'd be heard no more and the scandalous Wounds of hotheaded Parties heal'd which is the only way to secure this Island from foreign Insults and establish Peace more firmly than Armies tho' vast as  Xerxes  led can do  To attempt your Grace's Character is the superiour business of a Masculine Pen and not to be reach'd by mine But since my Husband has the Honour to serve Her Majesty under the Command of Your Grace as he did the late King of glorious Memory under that of your noble Father I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to alter my  Resolution of prefixing your Grace's Name in the front of this Poem at once to shew my Gratitude and my Ambition And if when Your Grace's Mind's unbended from the Care and Business of the State it finds the way in some leisure Hour to divert Your Grace and the Author meet your Pardon for this Liberty my Wishes are all answer'd as I hope my Prayers will be that Your Grace may enjoy a perfect Health free from Pain in Mind and Body and see as many flourishing happy New Years as your best and dearest Friends can desire and every one add fresh Honours to those that are so deservedly worn by Your Grace at present which are the earnest Wishes of  MY LORD  Your Grace's  Most Obedient and Most Devoted Humble Servant  SUSANNA CENTLIVRE  THE PREFACE  I Shou'd not have troubled my Courteous Reader with a Preface had I not lain under the Necessity of Clearing my self of what some People have been pleas'd to charge me with  viz  of being the Author of a Paper call'd  The Female Tattler  consequently of a Paragraph in that of the    th Instant relating to this Comedy tho' I think no reasonable Person will believe I could be guilty of so much Folly Tho' Vanity is said to be the darling Vice of Womankind yet nothing but an Idiot wou'd express themselves so openly and I hope the World won't think me guilty of Printing what I must blush to Read nor imagine it Wrote even by any Friend of mine for two Reasons First the Grossness of the Flattery Secondly the Injury it must of course do me in the Run of my Play by putting those People out of Humour whose Action was to give Life to the Piece I suppose these Reasons are sufficient to convince the Judicious part that I was no ways concerned in those Reflections but own I was treated with all the seeming Civility in the World till the second Night of my Comedy I willingly submitted to Mr  Cibber  's Superiour Judgment in shortning the Scene of the Ghost in the last Act and believed him perfectly in the Right because too  much Repetition is tiresome Indeed when Mr  Estcourt  slic'd most of it out I cou'd not help interposing my Desires to the contrary which the rest readily comply'd with and I had the Satisfaction to see I was not deceiv'd in my Opinion of its pleasing This Passage I happen'd to mention among my Acquaintance for 'tis Natural to have a kind of a Tender for our own Productions but especially if they have the good Fortune to divert others Now if from this the Author of the  Tattler  gather'd his Account I am guilty of speaking but not designedly for who they are that Write that Paper or how Distinguish'd I am perfectly ignorant and declare I never was concern'd either in Writing or Publishing any of the  Tattlers    I never had the Vanity to think much less to publish that any thing I am capable of doing cou'd support the Stage tho' I have had the good Fortune to please or to find the Town willing to be pleas'd tho' at present it seems a certain Author has enter'd a Caveat against all Plays running to a sixth Night but his own Tho' an Opera interfer'd with this Comedy yet it brought above Forty Pounds the second Night which shew'd it had some Merit for I have known many a Play kept up that fail'd of half that Money the second Night Now by the Rules of the House it ought to have been play'd on But who can secure the Life of a Play when that of a Man is often Sacrific'd to the Malice of Parties This Play met with a kind Reception in general and notwithstanding the Disadvantages it had to struggle with by raising the Prices the first Day and the Nearness of  Christmas  it would have made its way to a sixth Night if it had had fair Play Mistake  me not I do not mean from the Representation for I must do the Players Reason Had I search'd all the Theatres in the World I cou'd not have selected a better Company nor had more Justice done me in the Action tho' they have not dealt honourably by me in my Bargain for they ought not to have stop'd the Run upon any Pique whatever 'Tis small Encouragment to Write for the Stage when the Actors according to the Caprice of their Humours mangre the Taste of the Town have power to sink the Reputation of a Play for if they resolve not to Act it the Town can't support it  Well if there is any Merit in suffering wrongfully I shall find my Account in't one time or other in the mean while I intreat the  Female Tattler  to be Witty no more at my Expence I desire I may not be rank'd in the Number of those that support the Stage since the Stage is become a Noun Substantive and resolves to shew it is able to stand by itself  PROLOGUE  By a GENTLEMAN Spoken by Mr  WILKS    OUR Female Author trembling stands within  Her Fear arises from another's Sin  One of her Sex has so abus'd the Town  That on her Score she dreads your angry Frown  Tho' I dare say poor Soul she never writ  Lampoon or Satyr on the Box or Pit  A harmless hum'rous Play is her Extent of Wit  Tho'  Bickerstaff  's vast Genius may engage  And lash the Vice and Follies of the Age  Why shou'd tender  Delia  tax the Nation  Stickle and make a Noise for Reformation  Who always gave a Loose her self to Inclination  Scandal and Satyr's thrown aside to Day  And Humour the sole Business of our Play  Beaux may dress on to catch the Ladies Hearts  And good Assurance pass for mighty Parts  The Citts may bring their Spouses without Fear  We shew no Wife that's poaching for an Heir  Nor teach the Use of fine Gause Handkercheir  Cowards may huff and talk of mighty Wonders  And Jilts set upfor Twenty thousand Pounders  Our Author even tho' she knows full well  Is so Goodnatur'd she forbears to tell  What Collonels lately have found out the Knack  To Muster Madam still by  Ned  or  Jack    To keep their Pleasures up a Frugal way  They give herSubaltern's Subsistance for her Pay  In short what e'er your Darling Vices are  They pass untouch'd in this Night's Bill of Fare  But if all this can't your good Nature wake  Tho' here and there a Scene shou'd fail to take  Yet spare her for the  BusieBody  's sake  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs  OLDFIELD Written by Mr  Cibber A Porter delivers a Letter just as she is going to speak  WHAT's this a BilletDeaux from Hands unknown  'Tis new to send it thus 'fore all the Town  But since the poor Man's Passion's so agog  I'll read it out by way of Epilogue  Reads  Madam  Permit a Wretch to let you know  That he's no more in  Statu Quo    My Ruine from this Night commences  Unless your Smiles refund my Senses  For with one Thrust of  Cupid  's Dart  You've whip'd your Slave quite thro' the Heart  Therefore I beg you cast your Eye  O'er Boxes Pit and Gallery  In Pity of my Pains and Doubt  And try if you can find me out  Poor Soul He seems indeed in dismal Plight  Let's see it can't be sure from th' upper Flight  No nothat's plainfor None of them can Write  Nor can I think it from the Middle fell  For I'm afraidas few of them can Spell  Beside their Haggling Passions never gain  Beyond the Passagewalking Nymphs of  DruryLane  And then the Pit's more stock'd with Rakes and Rovers  Than any of these senseless whining Lovers  The Backs o' th' Boxes too seem mostly lin'd  With Souls whose Passion's to themselves confin'd  I  s  ort I can't perceive 'mongst all you Sparks  The Wretch distinguish'd by these bloody Marks  But since the Town has heard your kind Commands Sir  The Town shall e'en be Witness of my Answer  First then Beware you prove no Spark in Red  With empty Purse and Regimental Head  That thinks no Woman can refuse t'engage in't  While Love's advanc'd with offer'd Bills on Agent  That swears he'll settle from his Joy's commencing  And make the Babe the Day he's Born an Ensign  Nor cou'd I bear a Titl'd Beau that steals  From fasting Spouse her Matrimonial Meals  That Modish sends next Morn to her Apartment  A Civil Howdeyefar alas from th' Heart meant  Then Powder'd for th' ensuing Day's Delights  Bows thro' his Croud of Duns and drives to  White  's  Nor cou'd I like the Wretch that all Night plays  And only takes his Rest on Winning Days  That sets up from a lucky Hit his Rattler  Then's trac'd from his Orig'nalin the  Tattler    To tell you all that are my fixt Aversion  Wou'd tire the Tongue of Malice or Aspersion  But if I find 'mongst All One generous Heart  That Deaf to Stories takes this Stage's Part  That thinks that Purse deserves to keep the Plays  Whose Fortune's bound for the Support of Opera's  That thinks our Constitution here is justly fixt  And now no more with Lawyers Brawls perplext  He I declare shall my whole Heart receive  And what's more strange I'll love him while I live  Drammatis Personae  Men  Sir  Jeffry Constant  Mr  Bowman  Father to Captain  Constant  Captain  Constant  Mr  Mills  In Love with  Belinda  Lovely  Mr

Pox of this riding PostLook ye Captain if you have threescore Miles farther to go I am your most humble Servant  Capt  No Sirrah I am at my Journey's endThis Town of  Peterborough  is the bound of all my Wishes  Clin  Say you so Sir Pray be pleas'd to make it mine too  Capt  Why what is your wish  Clin  Why with submission Sir to know the reason of your Expedition and gravity of Habit Have you a mind to set up the Business of an Undertaker here in the Country  Const  No  Clinch  my business is with the Living not with the Dead I'll assure you  Clin  Then can't I for my blood imagine why you are thus dress'd your Father nay your whole Family are well not so much as a Nephew or second Cousin dead nay nor no fear of PeaceThen why the Devil are we in black You laughCan these Cloaths cause Joy without the Perquisite that belongs to it 'Tis a mournful Equipage and shocks my Soul I am sure  Const  Perquisite Why what Perquisite does Mourning bring with it to cause Joy ha  Clin  Oh Sir severalAs when a Wife buries her Husband she has Sorrow in one hand and Joy in t'other a short Widowhood cures such a GriefOr a rich Heir at the last Gasp of his Parent when there is a Years Rent in the Steward's  hands But Sir to the point either let me into the Secret or discharge me  Const  Ha ha ha Why then if I must tell thee this Habit if Fortune favours me will be worth to me two thousand Pounds  Clin  Say you so Sir and pray how much will it be worth to me For I am dress'd like youIf I have not the same Privileges why should I be confin'd to the same Garb  Const  Oh you shall have your part  Clinch  never fear  Clin  Ay Sir but there are some parts I don't care for I hope you have no design to rob upon the Highway  Const  Rascal  Clin  Nay ben't angry Sir if there shou'd be Peace 'tis what many an honest Gentleman must come to I have no aversion for the Name but I have for the Punishment I'll not strike a stroketherefore what good can I do you  Const  Ha ha ha I shall have more occasion for your Eyes than your ArmYou can weep Sirrah can't you  Clin  Ay Sir I shall weep that's certain to see you come to the Gallows  Const  Ye Dog you I tell you there is no danger  Clin  No dangerWhy then I shall weep for Joy Sir but how Sir how must I roar or shed Tears  Const  So you do but counterfeit well no matter which  Clin  Ah let me alone for counterfeiting I defie a Woman to outdo me in thatLook ye Sir you shall hear hem hem  Roars out  Const  Very wellbe sure when I weep  Clin  I'll make terrible FacesWhat think you Sir Is not my Pipe very musical for weeping  Const  Oh Excellent  Clin  But what does this signifie Where lies the Mystery  Const  Well thenSince you must know it You are not insensible how my Father has treated me ever since I refus'd to marry Mrs  Homebred  whose Manners suited with her Name and her Face was courser than either and because I drew a Bill upon him for fifty Pounds last Campaign he threatens to disinherit me nay and swears that if for the future I don't make it appear I live upon half my Pay He'll  make my Serjeant his Heir who was once his Footman In short I can bear his ill usage no longer  Clin  Ah Sir had you married that Lady with twenty thousand Pounds you need not have drawn upon him for fifty  Const  If she had twenty times as much I shou'd refuse her for  Belinda  's sake  Clin  But Sir  Jeffrey  resolves against that MatchYou must not marry his Steward's Daughter  Const  I hope to prove you a Lyar Sir and by this Dress to carry my design which is to persuade  Trusty  that my Father dyed of an Apoplexy by which means he must account with me for the half Years Rent he sent the old Gentleman word was ready for him  Const  Two thousand Pound  Clinch  This Letter I surpriz'd by an Accident 'tis from my Father to him  Reads  Mr  Trusty    The several Sums which you have return'd me without any Receipt amounts to eight hundred Pounds there remains behind two thousand two hundred Pounds which you tell me is ready for me don't give your self any trouble about remitting that for I design to be down my self in a Fortnight and then the Leases which you mention'd shall be renew'd You need write no more till you see  Your real Friend  Jeffrey Constant    Clin  Excellent Sir Why here may be a pretty Penny towards if the Devil don't cross it But Sir if my old Master shou'd take a Maggot and write to  Trusty  to return his Money after allHis Letter and our Story wou'd have small connexion we shou'd be oblig'd to alter our Note I wou'd advise you to take the old Steward to the Tavern and stay as little in his House as you can for fear of discovery Besides Sir a Glass of Wine and a Fowl makes business go on chearfully Sir  Const  Chearfully SirrahYou don't consider that it is not my business to be chearfulI admire  Faithful  stays so long  Clin  Perhaps he can't find Mr  Lovely  Sir  Const  I directed him to the  Coffeehouse  where he seldom fails to be at this time of the Morning  Clin  Poor Gentleman I warrant he's ruminating upon his Misfortunes Well 'tis sometimes a Blessing to want Money You 'scap'd the Highwaymen Sir  Const  What am I the better for that Sirrah My Pockets are as empty as my Friends who fell into their Hands But here comes my Fellow Travellerand  Lovely  with him He has found him at last Dear  Lovely  how is't  Enter  Lovely Faithful  and  Manage  in Riding habit    Lov  Captain  Constant  Welcome Who expected to see you here Why did  t you send me word of your coming  Clin  He hardly knew it himself two hours before he got on Horseback Sir nay I much question if he knows it yet  Const  My Journey indeed was something Precipitate  Clin  Ay Sir don't you see we are in Mourning  Lov  Mr  Faithful  has inform'd me of every Particular and I wish I cou'd really give thee Joy of six thousand a Year Boy  Clin  At the rate of half a Years Rent you mayIf Fortune proves not an errand Jilt indeed Sir  Lov  Come Gentlemen What think you of my House I'll get something for Breakfast whilst you change your Linen  Const  'Tis near SixI have a mind to see if  Belinda  comes to Church this Morning  Lov  She seldom fails  Faith  Prithee  Lovely  Can you inform me if a young Lady that lives at Sir  David Watchum  's will be here too  Lov  Mrs  Laura Wealthy  Your Mistress you mean  Faith  The same  Lov  We have heard of the Lady but I believe no body in  Peterborough  has seen her except his own Servants  Const  What kind of a temper is the old Fellow of  Lov  The most peevish splenetick mistrustful illnatur'd Wretch in the whole County He comes to the Coffeehouse every Morning in an old rusty Chariot for haste the longest Journey  he takes in the Year He seldom comes to Church nay since that Lady came he has not once been seen there we fancy he dares not stay two hours from home for fear she should be stol'n away  Man  Ah Sir this account is most uncomfortable in our Affairs  Faith  It gives me more Chagrin than the Rogues did when they stripp'd me of my Money this Morning Which way shall I give  Laura  notice of my being in Town  Const  Have Courage  Faithful  I warrant we prosper  Lov  Nothing like a good Heart you shall not want a small Sum of Money Sir  Faith  I thank you Sir  Const  I'll be as diligent in thy Affairs as in my own if any lucky Opportunity offers I'll be ready to serve thee  Lov  I'll be the same to both  Const  I know it and when I am able as I hope if my design succeeds thou shal't meet returns in me  Faith  I am oblig'd to bothBut who have we here  Several People cross the Stage to Church  Lov  Here comes  Belinda  and with her my Tyrant  Maria    Faith  Well Gentlemen you'll best entertain your Mistresses alone I'll back to the Coffeehouse and over a Dish of Tea think what Course to steer  Const  Mind if the  Courant  be there wherein I got my Father's Death inserted the better to favour my Plot  Faith  I will Captain and be sure to confirm the News  Exit  Faith▪  and  Manage  Lov  We'll call of you there presently  The Bell rings  Const  But is  Maria  obdurate still  Lovely  Lov  Not in reality  Constant  But she has so much of the Woman in her to keep up her Rule till the last  Enter  Belinda  and  Maria  Const  Ladies good morrow The sound of the Saint's Bell brings Angels abroad  Salutes 'em  Bel  Constant  and in Mourning Pray who's dead  Const  One for whom I ought to grieve did it not smooth a Passage to  Belinda  's Arms through the Hearts of our inexorable Parents  Bel  Your Father Sir  Clin  The same Madam He's as dead as an Herring I promise you  Mar  Now don't I know whether I had best say I'm sorry for your Loss or wish you much Joy of your Gain  Clin  I dare swear Madam he can't tell you yet  Const  Peace Blockhead  Mar  Mr  Lovely  are you for Prayers  Const  You are the Shrine he kneels to Madam if you'll vouchsafe to hear him he can pray most devoutly  Mar  And dissemble most fervently  Lov  No faith Madam that Quality does not belong to usthat is the Womens Prerogative  Bel  And do you never encroach upon our Privileges sweet Sir  Lov  Yes yes faith I have encroach'd upon some of the Sexes Privileges in my time I must own Curiosity Madam seldom leads us to put on Masking Habits but a Lady cannot dress without 'em Dissimulation is as necessary as her Patches  Bel  Ay How do you prove that  Lov  Why thus When you wou'd gain a Man you like you appear what you are notWe believe you Angels but don't always find you so  Mar  We always find you Angels but of the fal'n kind  Const  'Tis impossible to be otherwise whilst Beauty keeps her Court below you charm our Eyes and all our Senses wait you  Lov  Pride and Vanity predominate in your Sex and like Centinels relieve one another Pride has made a Lady swear she has Hated such a Man tho' she was dying for the Sight of himAnd Vanity made her Caress a Fop that at the same time she wish'd at the Devil  Mar  And are not you even with us Will not you sigh ogle cringe flatter swear kneel nay give it under your hand you Love to desperation but let the poor mistaken  Nymph once yield and you'd give Bond and Judgment to that Old Gentleman you nam'd but now in two Days to take her off your hands  Const  I hope you don't include the whole Sex Madam  Lov  That she do's not I'm sure for she knows I never swore any thing to her but what I am ready to make good And if she be not the most unconscionable Woman living she will own I love her heartily  Const  That I dare witness for thee  Lovely    Bel  Ay Why what Proofs has he given  Lov  Proofs Why I talk of her all DayAnd dream of her all NightWhen she's absent sigh for her and am transported when I see her If these be not proofs of Love let the Parson say Grace and I'll give her better  Bel  All this may be done without one Grain of Love may it not Captain  Const  Not when you are the Object Madam and you are too well acquainted with my Heart to ask that Question out of scruple I'm certain  Mar  These are no Proofs you must grow Lean and MeagreEat little and Sleep lessWrite fifty Letters in a Day and burn them all againThen start up and draw your Sword hold it to your Breast then throw it away agen Then take your Pen and write your last FarewelDispatch it to your MistressThen take a Turn by some melancholy purling Stream with Hat pull'd o'er your Eyes in deep Contemplation resolve thro' what Door to let in Death if the Messenger return without SuccessWhen I see you do this I'll write Lover upon your Brow  Lov  When I do you shall write Fool upon my Forehead  Hang this whining way of Wooing  Loving was design'd a Sport  c  Sings  Const  Come come Madam a Truce you know he loves you  Lov  As well as I know she loves me we were born for one another Child no Man in the Kingdom shall have thee but my selfThen if you will eat Chalk and die of the Pip I can't help it Ha ha ha  Mar  Be not so positive  Lovely  One Sect of Philosophers tells you you ought to doubt of every thing  Lov  But the Topick was not a Woman in that Assertion but if it were Women in their Days were no more like Women in ours than a Clodhopper is to a Captain o' Foot Our Ladies are like two Negatives to be understood in the Affimative ha ha Madam do's not my Friend here look like one of those Lovers you describ'd Faith I think a Woman cannot wish a simpler FigureNow has he a thousand Things to say to  Belinda  alone  Const  You guess right  Lovely  I am going to your Father's Madam to settle our Accounts I hope you'll return as soon as Prayers are over  Bel  Directly  Const  Oh  Belinda  Now is the Crisis of our Good or Ill  Turn for me Fate or let thy Wheel stand still  Lov  You'll remember us in your Prayers Ladies  Mar  Amongst  Jews Turks  and  Infidels    Exit  Lov  Come now for my
