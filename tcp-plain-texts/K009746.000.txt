IT would be unjust to send the following Pieces into the World without acknowledging the high Respect I have for Mr M'PHERSON's great Abilities since he has a very particular Right to share in the Reputation these Poems may chance to acquire the Versification being made from his elegant and spirited Prose Translation of  Ossian  's inimitable Performances That we have them preserved from being swallowed up in the Gulph of Oblivion is owing to his fine Discernment and incomparable Industry  TO THE EARL of POMFRET  MY LORD  THOUGH I am seldom inclined to think much of my own little Abilities I cannot help feeling some Vanity when their Essays are crown'd with the Approbation of so great a Master in the Belles Lettres as your Lordship To be able to engage the Attention or acquire the Patronage of the Earl of POMFRET implies Merit Since to the many Virtues which reflect Honour upon elevated Rank he adds deep Penetration strong Judgment well digested Learning and a Taste truly elegant  I should think myself My Lord ungrateful if I omitted this Opportunity of assuring you I shall always retain a deep Sense of the very particular Favours you have been pleased to confer upon

obedient Servant SAMUEL DERRICK  Chelsea  March  The ARGUMENT  FINGAL King of  Morven  returning Home victorious from the Expedition in  Ireland  which is celebrated in the Epic Poem bearing his Name made a Feast to which all his Chiefs  Maronnan  and  Aldo  excepted were invited The Neglect seems to have been accidental however they resented it so strongly as to abandon their native Country and enter into the Service of  Erragon  King of  Sora  a Name given to some Part of  Scandinavia  Here  Lorma  the beautiful Wife of  Erragon  seeing  Aldo  by chance his Reputation as a Warrior being very high fell in Love with him He return'd her Passion and they fled into  Morven Erragon  pursuing them invaded that Kingdon with a powerful Force and slew  Aldo  in single Combat but was himself slain by  Gaul  the Son of  Morni  and his Army defeated This is the Subject of the ensuing Poem which is beautiful sentimental and interesting It was deliver'd by  Ossian  after becoming blind to a  Culdee  or Christian Hermit who led a recluse Life near him and whose Sacred Hymns he imagined were composed in Honour of his deceased Chiefs or Addresses to the Spirits in the Air  THE BATTLE of LORA A POEM  SON of the distant Land within whose Cell  Calm Peace and Heavenly Contemplation dwell  What Notes of warbling Melody are these  That pierce  thy  Grove and sigh upon the Breeze  Tho' loud th' impetuous Torrent in mine Ear  The Voice of Songs a tuneful Voice I hear  Perhaps you call your Country's Chiefs to mind  Or praise the Spirits in the posting Wind  Son of the Rock cast o'er the Plain thine Eyes  Among the Heath thou see'st green Tombs arise  The rank Grass whistles round and rising Stones  Mark the sad Spot where lie the Heroe's Bones  Thou lonely Dweller of the Rock can'st see  But ah that Blessing is not left to me  In vain these Eyes roll round in search of Light  For  Ossian  's Eyes are quench'd in endless Night  Down pours the Mountain Stream from yonder Source  And round the green Hill forms its winding Course  Tufted with Moss four Stones their Tops uprear  Above the wither'd Grass two Trees are near  Their heavy Branches bent beneath the Storm  Here sleeps dread  Erragon  thy mould'ring Form  Thee  Erragon  this narrow House contains  No more thy Shell resounds thro'  Sora  's Plains  No more wilt thou the Sword in Battle wield  Dark in thy Hall and useless hangs thy Shield  Scarce is thy Blood upon our Mountains dry  Sovereign of Shipsand low the Valiant lie  Lov'st thou the Song Son of the secret Cell  Attend while  Lora  's bloody Fight I tell  Tho' long forgotten on the spacious Plain  And scarce the Marks of ruthless War remain  So when hoarse Thunders bellow thro' the Sky  A thousand Spirits from the Caves reply  Blue Lightnings round the Hills of  Morven  play  Gleaming pale Horrors on the doubtful Day  Gradual the Storm subsides the Horizon clears  A settled Calm the faded Landscape cheers  The golden Sun revives the drooping Isle  The rough Rocks glitter and the Mountains smile  From  Ullin  's rolling Waves we steer'd our Way  Our Ships now enter'd  Cona  's spacious Bay  Loose hung our Sails we spurn'd the foaming Flood  And heard the Tempest howl thro'  Morven  's Wood  The King's Horn soundsat once the startled Deer  Rous'd from their Coverts fled the Danger near  Thick pour'd our Arrows and the festal Board  Was soon with Choice of smoaking Viands stor'd  Blith on the Rocks we revel'd in Delight  Swaran  our mortal Foe had fallen in Fight  Two Heroes at the Feast had been forgot  Their bosoms burn'd with Rage and blackening Thought  In secret round they glanc'd their kindled Eyes  Their Indignation spoke in bursting Sighs  Close they conferr'd they threw their Spears to Earth  Obscuring like two murky Clouds our Mirth  So on the settled Sea blue Mists arise  In vapory Volumes darkening to the Skies  They glitter in the Sun but Seamen fear  The Lustre short and rising Tempests near  " Loose my white Sails we'll catch the Western Breeze"  Maronnan  spoke "We'll plough the Northern Seas  " We fought his Battles  Aldo  yet forgot  " At  Fingal  's FeastSince such our injur'd Lot  " To Foreign Lands we'll bear our martial Might  " And strengthen  Erragon  in dubious Fight  " His Post is Terror and his Eyes are Flame  " War points his Spear and Death attends his Name  " His ecchoing Battles shall our Swords renown  " And with immortal Wreaths of Glory crown"  Snatching their Swords and Shields they quickly sought  Lumar  's wish'd Bay and to the Shore were brought  Just as returning from the Chace was seen  The chief of bounding Steeds of haughty Mein  Gloom wrapp'd his Face he murm'ring as he went  A smother'd Song seem'd lost in dark Intent  Gladly the Strangers at his Feasts he saw  And to his Foes their glittering Arms gave Law  Brave  Aldo  once returning from the Fight  Was seen by  Lorma Erragon  's Delight  His beauteous Wifeand then in luckless Hour  She first acknowledg'd Love's imperious Power  Aldo  she saw but like an Evening Sun  Glancing an upward Beam his Race now run  Her Head she lean'd on her right Arm reclin'd  Her darkbrown Locks loose floated in the Wind  Still as she look'd high heav'd her Breasts of Snow  Quick throbb'd her Heart and Tears unbidden flow  The pearly Drop her newborn Passion spoke  And in the Air in Sighs her Sorrows broke  Three Days she pin'd dissembled Joy her Grief  Conceal'd the Fourth came wing'd with kind Relief  The Hero clasp'd her in his vigorous Arms  And o'er the briny Flood convey'd her Charms  To  Cona  's Bay to  Fingal  's lofty Tower  There safe from  Erragon  's vindictive Power  When lo in Wrath  the King of Morven  rose  And said "Shall I defend thee from thy Foes  " What shall  Fingal  a Ravisher befriend  " Proudhearted  Aldo  how can I defend  " Who will my People in their Halls receive  " The Feast of Strangers who hereafter give  " Hence Youth of feeble Hand avoid the Brave  " Thy Guilt conceal in some deserted Cave  " While we prepare with  Sora  's King to fight  " Who threatens like black Tempests in the Night  " Spirit of noble  Trenmor  say shall Peace  " Ne'er bless my Age Shall  Fingal  never cease  " From War's Alarms but born amid the Fight  " Must Blood his Progress mark to endless Night  " Yet never were the Weak by me distrest  " Never my Sword the unequal Combat prest  " Oh  Morven  yes thy raging Storms I know  " In Time my stately Towers shall overthrow  " When of my Children all in Battle slain  " Nought but their Tombs shall on the Heath remain  " When none survive the noble Youths to mourn  " When none in  Selma  's mouldering Shades sojourn  " Feeble in Arms perhaps a Race may come  " Who scarce will know where rises  Fingal  's Tomb  " Yet in the Song shall flourish his Renown  " In Song to future Times transmitted down"  As round the turbid Spirits of the Night  Are summon'd to convene on  Morven  's Height  The gath'ring Tempests in vindictive Hour  Which he prepares on foreign Realms to pour  Round  Erragon  now landed on the Coast  Embodied close so roll'd his martial Host  While to the  King of Shields  his Bard he sent  Charging him thus to utter his Intent  " Tell him the Fight of Thousands we demand  " Or else Possession of his hilly Land"  The Sovereign sitting in his Hall was found  The grave Companions of his Youth around  For the young  Heroes  Thunderbolts of War  Were at the Chace or in the Desart far  The Sages told what other Times had seen  And what their Deeds in earlier Days had been  When  Narthmor  King of streamy  Lora  came  Strong tho' in Years and of illustrious Name  " This is no Time" began the Chief "to hear  " The Song of other Days the Foe so near  " Fierce  Erragon  advances on the Strand  " And lifts ten thousand Swords against the Land  " Among his Chiefs he stalks with gloomy Pace  " Like the dark Moon when Meteors shroud her Face"  " Come Daughter of my Love" then said  Fingal  "  Bosmina  come from thy sequester'd Hall  " The rough War threatens be it thine to save  " The Land from Blood the Soldier from the Grave  " To gallant  Erragon  this Message bear  " Say "we for him the festal Board prepare  " The Peace of Heroes we request and say  " The Wealth of  Aldo  at his Feet we lay  " Take thou the Stranger's Steedsthey are not slow  "  Narthmor  and with the Maid of  Morven  go  "  Bosmina  haste our Youths are distant far  " And bending Age unequal is to War"  To  Sora  's gazing Bands  Bosmina  bright  Shone forth as on a Cloud a Beam of Light  Her left Hand with a sparkling Shell was grac'd  A Golden Arrow in her Right was plac'd  As when the Solar Rays a Passage find  Thro' envious Clouds rent by the rising Wind  The Vale rejoices in the genial Heat  Smiling the King advanced the Maid to meet  Thus mildly blushing she began to speak  " Thy Royal Presence we in  Selma  seek  " For thee the Feast is spread by  Morven  's King  " I'll be thy Guide provided Peace you bring  " Listen fam'd Warrior then to our Request  " Of Peace accept and let the dark Sword rest  " The Wealth of Kings we offer if you chuse  " Nor you to hear what  Aldo  says refuse  " An hundred Steeds he gives that own the Rein  " Never a swifter Race devour'd the Plain  " An hundred Maids from distant Lands he gives  " Beneath the Sky not brighter Beauty lives  " An hundred Hawks all well inur'd to Game  " Of which none Haggard ever miss'd their Aim  " An hundred Girdles also shall be thine  " Such when they round highbosom'd Women twine  " Gives sudden Ease to Travails' fiercest Throes  " And their vast Virtue every Matron knows  " Ten Shells with Gems inlaid which ours we call  " Shall Lustre beam thro'  Sora  's lofty Hall  " Trembling upon their Stars blue Waters shine  " And to the Eye appear like sparkling Wine  " The World's great Kings Lords of the distant Seas  " Once quaff'd delicious Beverage from these  " They all are thineor  Lorma  fair shall grace  " Thy Tower again and pant in thy Embrace  " Tho' much  Fingal  the gen'rous  Aldo  loves  " Thus  Erragon  his Wish for Peace he proves  "  Fingal  who never did a Hero wrong  " Never Injustice tho' his Arm be strong"  " Soft Voice of  Cona  "  Sora  's King reply'd  " Tell him he does in vain the Feast provide  " Unless he bow to my superior Sway  " And at my Feet his Spoils submissive lay  " The Shields of other Times let him resign  " And let  me  all his Fathers Swords call  mine  " These in my Hall so shall my Sons behold  " And say "those Arms were once  Fingal  's the bold"  " Never shall they behold them in thy Hall  " Never so low shall  Morven  's Monarch fall  " Still are they grasp'd by the firm Hand of Might  " By Heroes who ne'er yielded in the Fight"  Bosmina  spoke by Patriot Pride alarm'd  And kindling Passion all her Visage warm'd  " King of reecchoing  Sora  too" she said  " Thou art to Death by this thy Pride betray'd  " For on our Hills the Storms begin to lower  " Which must thy numerous Ranks and thee devour"  Now  Selma  's towering Walls  Bosmina  sought  Silent she went and  Fingal  read her Thought  In Strength he rose his Silver Locks he shook  The sounding Mail of  Trenmor  then he took  His Father's ShieldDarkness o'er  Selma  spread  When on his Spear his outstretch'd Hand he laid  Myriads of howling Ghosts around were heard  And many a gallant Hero's Fall was fear'd  Stern Joy in each old Warrior's Visage glows  While on they press'd to meet their Country's Foes  The Feats of former Times their Minds employ  The Fame which those who fall in War enjoy  When lo the panting Dogs upon the Plain  Were seen where  Trathail  long in Dust had lain  Fingal  then knew his youthful Heroes near  And stopt the Thunder of his bold Career  First  OscarMorni  's Sonand  Nemis'  Race  Then  Fercuth  shew'd his cloudy Form and Face  Dermid  his dark Hair sporting in the Wind  And  Ossian  last O Stranger came behind  Propt by my Spear I leapt each little Stream  And sungold Times and Actions past my Theme  Of mighty Men I thoughtwhen near at Hand  War's dismal Din was eccho'd thro' the Land  For hardy  Fingal  struck his bossy Shield  A thousand Swords unsheath'd wave o'er the Field  Three greyhair'd Sons of Song then lift the Voice  Of Harmony a mournful Theme their Choice  With sounding Step in youthful Prowess strong  Tremendous to the View we rush'd along  So pours impetuous thro' the narrow Vale  The drifting Storm of Sleet and driving Hail  On the green Hill  Fingal  now sat reclin'd  His glittering Standard flutter'd in the Wind  The tough Companions of his Youth were near  Graceful their waving Locks of Age appear  Now he beheld his Sons in War arise  And heartfelt Pleasure sparkled in his Eyes  For midst the Lightning of their Swords he saw  From their Forefathers Deeds they took their Law  Like the fierce Torrent of a Wintry Night  Stout  Erragon  advanc'd of matchless Might  Death track'd his Footsteps wheresoe'er he came  The Ranks were thin'd as Heath's consum'd by Flame  " Who" says  Fingal  "comes like the bounding Roe  " The Hart which we in ecchoing  Cona  know  " His bright Shield glitters on his manly Side  " His Armor clangs but mournful is his Pride  " He meets with  Erragon  How big the Strife  " The Battle of the Chiefsthey toil for Life  " So when in Air high rules the Tempest's Rage  " In Combat fierce appalling Ghosts engage  " Son of the Hill thou fall'st distain'd with Blood  " From thy white Bosom streams Life's crimson Flood  " Ah hapless  Lorma  thy hard Fate deplore  " Weep wretched Woman  Aldo  is no more"  The Hero's Spear the  King  of  Sora  took  And on his Body cast a pitying Look  Round on the Foe his deathful Eyes then threw  When  Gaul  came forth to Virtue ever true  Who can the Conflict of the Heroes tell  Their wonderous Deedsthe royal Stranger fell  " Sons of lov'd  Cona  " loud brave  Fingal  cried  " Hold Death's red Hand and stop the purple Tide  " For ah the Great his last in Dust has groan'd  " And much in  Sora  is his Fall bemoan'd  " The Traveller shall to his Hall repair  " And wonder at the Silence reigning there  " Stranger the King is levell'd with the Dust  " His House's JoyWho in their Strength may trust  " Harka shrill Voice quick thro' his Woods it pass'd  " Perhaps his Spirit that bestrides the Blast  " But he is distant faron  Morven  low  " Fell  Erragon  beneath a foreign Foe"  Thus spoke  Fingal  the tuneful Song of Peace  The Bard rais'd highthe Swords from Slaughter cease  The feeble Foe was spar'd for better Days  While added Glories round the  The Standard of  Fingal  was called the Sunbeam from its being richly adorned with Jewels  Sunbeam blaze  Within that Tomb the conquer'd Chief we laid  And I the Song of Lamentation made  Oft o'er the Sky when Night's dark Vapours come  The Hero's mourning Ghost appears to some  Pale Sorrow say they on his Face impress'd  And halfform'd Sighs seem labouring in his Breast  Blest  Sora  's King be thy departed Soul  Thine Arm the Tide of Battle could controul  Fair  Lorma  sat and fast descended Night  Thro'  Aldo  's Hall a flaming Oak gave Light  With Expectation big her Bosom burn'd  Sad she look'd out but saw him not return'd  " Where can my Joy my Comfort thus remain  "  Cona  's lov'd Hunter what can thee detain  " You promis'd to return e'er setting Day  " Has then the Deer been distant far away  " Do the bleak Winds sigh round thee on the Heath  " Where murmuring Spirits guard their Bones beneath  " Where is my Friend Where where my  Aldo  gone  " Wherefore am I with Strangers left alone  " My  Aldo  never yet neglectful prov'd  " Come from thy ecchoing Hills my best belov'd"  Oft to the Gate she turns her swimming Eyes  Oft listens as the rustling Breezes rise  'Tis  Aldo  's TreadJoy lightens in her Face  It is not heHow short the smiling Space  Now anxious Thoughts again her Visage shroud  As the pale Moon behind a watery Cloud  " Return my Love nor thus my Hopes defraud  " Return my LoveAgain I'll look abroad  " Soft in the  East  the Queen of Stars is bright  " And the calm Lake reflects her Silver Light  " Shall I not see his faithful Dogs appear  " His faithful Dogs would tell my Hero near  " When shall his wellknown Accents on the Wind  " Tho' distant loud revive my pensive Mind  " Come from thy towering Hillsmy Love appear  " Thy  Lorma  callshe's silentmuch I fear"  As when a Midnight Shower invests the Plain  The Moon a dusky Beam darts thro' the Rain  His shivering Ghost upon a Rock was seen  The Shade she follow'd o'er the gloomy Green  For now she knew the Hero was no more  I heard her in the Wind her Fate deplore  I heard her Mourning like the Gales that pass  Over yon Cave that sigh among the Grass  She came she found the Spot where  Aldo  lay  Her Voice grew faint and gradual died away  Pale as the Vapor rising o'er the Lake  She roll'd her heavy Eyes nor more she spake  Few were her Days in  Cona  when she died  And Beauty's Blossom wither'd in its Pride  Fingal  commanded and his Bards proclaim  In melancholy Song her deathless Fame  Morven  's fair Daughters once in every Year  Drop o'er her Claycold Grave a pitying Tear  When Autumn's Blasts upon the Hills appear  Son of the Land far distant from our own  Whose Dwelling is the Field of fair Renown  O let thy Song be sometimes tun'd to those  Who fell in Battle thence their Fame arose  So their thin Ghosts around thee shall rejoice  And on a Moonbeam  Lorma  hear thy Voice  When in thy Cave thou lay'st thee down by Night  Thou shalt behold her in the humid Light  And thou wilt own that she indeed was fair  Tho' wet her Cheek and wan her Face with Care  MORAR A FRAGMENT  THE Rain's dispers'd the Storm of Wind is past  No more I shiver in the dreary Blast  Calm is the Noon The burning Lamp of Day  From Hill to Hill pursues his circling Way  A rising Rainbow bends across the Skies  And fleecy Clouds display their varying Dies  Red pours the sudden Stream o'er yonder Steep  And thro' the Valley spreads with murm'ring Sweep  How softly plaintive sounds it on mine Ear  Yet softer far yon mourning Voice I hear  'Tis  Alpin  'she in sadly soothing Strain  Laments some gallant Youth untimely slain  Alpin  the Son of Song his Head of Snow  Bends under Age and Tears his Eyes o'erflow  Say Son of Song why on the silent Hill  These lonely Bounds thy sad Complainings fill  Why like the Wave upon the desart Shore  Or Blasts thro' wintry Woods do'st thou thy Fate deplore  ALPIN  Ryno  my Friend these heartsprung Tears are shed  This Voice of Woe is rais'd for  Morar  dead  Tho' tall thy Stature on the Hill is seen  And fair thy Beauty on the level Green  Yet thou must fall like him while all around  Thy Tombthe Voice of Sorrow shall resound  Unstrung thy Bow shall lie within the Hall  Nor Echo from the Hills her Huntsman call  Swift wer't thou  Morar  as the Mountain Roe  Wrath o'er thy Face diffus'd a fiery Glow  Descending furious as  December  Storm  Thy Sword like Light'ning could the Field deform  Thy Voice express'd the Torrent after Rain  And echo'd with Heaven's Thunder thro' the Plain  Beneath his warrior Arm what Numbers fell  Thou can'st O Genius of my Country tell  His Arm mow'd down the Valiant and the Great  As falls before the Scythe the ripen'd Wheat  But how serene thy Brow beheld afar  Returning mildly glorious from the War  Thy Face appear'd the Sun when Rains subside  Or shone the gentler Moon at Midnight Tide  Calm as the Bosom of the lucid Lake  When not a whisp'ring Breeze remains awake  Alas how narrow is thy Place become  How low how darksome thine eternal Home  Three Paces round outmeasure now thy Grave  O  Morar  late the Mighty and the Brave  No other Witness of his Fame is seen  Save three rude Stones whose Tops are moss'd with Green  Beneath yon leafless solitary Tree  Sad Emblem of decay'd Mortality  Thro' the long Grass where moans the passing Wind  The Grave of gallant  Morar  there you'll find  Morar  the Mighty's fallenhe is no more  No Mother's Sighs his hapless Fate deplore  No Maid his Loss bewails in plaintive Strains  Nor pours out Tears of Love upon his cold Remains  For Ah the Dame is dead that gave him Birth  And  Morglan  's lovely Daughter laid in Earth  Who who is he comes tott'ring o'er the Plain  Scarce can his Staff his feeble Limbs sustain  Grief marks his furrow'd Face his hoary Head  Is white with Age his Eyes with Tears are red  It is thy Father  Morar  yes'tis he  Thy hopeless Fatherhe had none but thee  Oft' when thy gallant Actions Fame has sung  How o'er the Tale enraptur'd has he hung  Yet Ah 'till now he heard not of the Wound  That brought his Darling breathless to the Ground  Long like an Oak he flourish'd on the Plains  Ah why this Blow to shatter his Remains  Thy Son is deafweep wretched Father weep  Low lie the Dead and heavy is their Sleep  Their Pillow Earth with them thro' one long Night  He sleeps for ever ravish'd from thy Sight  For ever goneno more thy Voice to hear  That Voice that us'd his warlike Soul to cheer  When will the Morning of the Grave arrive  To bid the Slumberer in the Dust revive  Thou bravest of the Sons of Men farewel  Who could the First in every Field excel  The Field no more shall find thy Sword display'd  Whose Edge beam'd Lightning thro' the darkest Shade  Thy Race is fallenno Son preserves thy Name  Yet shall this Verse immortalize thy Fame  And thy fair Deeds shall unborn Ages tell  How mighty  Morar  liv'd How fought How fell  The DIRGE A FRAGMENT  DARK Autumn rests upon the Mountain's Brow  While grey Mists hover on the Hills below  Loud o'er the barren Heath the Whirlwind howls  Hoarse thro' the narrow Plain the River rolls  On yonder Mount beneath the lonely Shade  Of that old Oak are  Connal  's Ashes laid  The wither'd Leaf first whirl'd awhile in Air  Quits the light Breeze and mourning settles there  Round when the Silver Regent of the Night  Rules Heav'n's high Vault and pours her softer Light  In her pale Beams departed Spirits play  Too weak to bear the stronger Blaze of Day  And by the lonely Hunter oft are seen  As musing slow he stalks along the Green  Who  Connal  to their Source thy Sires can trace  Who can recount the Fathers of thy Race  Like the stout Oak that on the Mountain Side  Meets the loud Storm and braves its furious Pride  Firm stood their Ranks upon the burnish'd Field  And taught the boldest of their Foes to yield  Uptorn thy Root beneath the Turf you lie  Who mighty  Connal  shall thy Place supply  Here clash'd the warrior Arms and here around  The Dying groan'd who strew'd the guilty Ground  Here  Connal  fellwith Mourning and Dismay  The Wars of  Fingal  mark'd the bloody Day  Thy Arm was like a Tempest from the  North  Like Lightning gleam'd thy Falchion when drawn forth  Thy Height a Rock did on the Plain appear  Thine Eyes a fiery Furnace flaming near  Louder than fighting Winds thy Voice was found  Scattering Confusion wild the Vallies round  The Strongest by thy Valour were o'erthrown  As a Boy's Staff hews tender Thistles down  Dargo  the Chief ambitious fierce and proud  Advanc'd like an impending ThunderCloud  Dargo  the Strong who never miss'd his Blow  Dark and contracted was his sullen Brow  His Eyes were like two Caves within a Rock  Bright rose their Swords and fearful was the Shock  Behind in Armour bright  Crimora  fair  Came watchful on old  Rinval  's OrphanCare  Bent was her Bow and loose her curling Hair  Long had she sigh'd for  Connal  's manly Charms  And him she sought amid the Din of Arms  At  Dargo  's Heart she aim'd the erring Shaft  And her lov'd  Connal  's dearest Blood it quaff'd  He fallsas on the Plain a mighty Oak  Or a rough Rock from its Foundation broke  He bleedsunhappy Maidyet no Relief  Her  Connal  diesVerse cannot paint her Grief  What shall she dothe long long Night she mourns  Detested Day all comfortless returns  " My Love my Friend" she cries"his Soul is fled  " In vain you weep no Tears awake the Dead'  Woeworn at length Death gives her Anguish rest  And her last Breath she pours on  Connal  's Breast  Inclos'd they peaceful lie within this Tomb  Both in the Pride of Youth and Beauty's Bloom  Upsprings the Grass beneath the unletter'd Stone  While mournful in the Shade I sit alone  And hear the sighing Wind their Fate bemoan  Full then their Memory pours upon my Mind  Where shall the Muse alas their Fellow find  Now undisturb'd together ye may sleep  Sacred the Mountain Tomb your Bones shall keep  CONNAL and CRIMORA An ELEGY  CRIMORA  WHO who is he that skirts the Hill afar  In Course effulgent as the Morning Star  Or as a  Western  Cloud in bright Array  Ting'd by the Flame of fastdescending Day  Loud as the hollow Wind his Voice I hear  Sweet as the Song of Carryl to the Ear  It is my Love encas'd with shining Steel  What Joys what Bliss ineffable I feel  Shortliv'd I fear for Sorrow shades his Face  Say  Connal  lives great  Fingal  's hardy Race  Why the dark BrowTo me thy Woes impart  Ah they already tear my troubled Heart  CONNAL  They live my LoveTwo Hours had pass'd of Morn  When I beheld them from the Chace return  They cross'd like streaming Light o'er yonder Fields  The Solar Ray reflected from their Shields  I saw them in a Line the Hill descend  Some sad Event my Love the Times portend  Fate has this melancholy Gloom impress'd  And Sighs unwonted heave my boding Breast  Give me my ArmsThe Task of War be mine  Our Youth are up in Armour clasp'd they shine  Tomorrow  Dargo  comes to try our Force  Dire will the Conflict be and red the warring Course  Enormous  Dargo  comes renown'd for Might  He calls the Race of  Fingal  to the Fight  The Sons of Wounds and Battle he defies  And clashing Arms shall thunder thro' the Skies  CRIMORA  As grey Mists thicken in autumnal Air  On the big Waves I saw his Sails appear  I saw his Vessels anchor near the Strand  And soon the mighty  Dargo  came to Land  And all his warlike Train a num'rous Band  CONNAL  They shall repent they touch'd this warlike Shore  Bring me the Shield the Soldier  Rinval  wore  Thy Father's BucklerThus with livid Light  The Moon full orb'd gleams thro' the wintry Night  CRIMORA  This Shield O  Connal  to thine Arm I bind  Yet oh retain old  Rinval  's Fate in mind  For no Defence in this my Father found  But bit in Agonies of Death the Ground  Here pierc'd stern  Gauror  's Spearthe Warrior fell  And who my  Connal  who thy Fate can tell  CONNAL  YesI may fall indeed if such my Fate  Remember Glory shorten'd  Connal  's Date  Raise thou my Tombso shall my Fame survive  Kept by the gentle Hand of Love alive  A Mound of Earth or rustic Pile of Stones  May mark the Grave that covers  Connal  's Bones  Tho' thou  Crimora  to my doating Sight  Art dearer far than to the Blind is Light  Tho' far less Pleasure wafts the Summer Gale  To him who toils incessant at the Flail  Tho' the parch'd Pilgrim in the Chrystal Brook  Less Comfort finds than I in one dear Look  Yet I will gomy Country calls to Arms  Her Parent Voice more strong than Beauty's Charms  Adieu  Crimora  hence appalling Gloom  If I should fall  Crimora  raise my Tomb  CRIMORA  The martial Glow I sympathetic feel  Give me those Arms the Sword the Lace of Steel  I'll face my Love with thee fierce  Dargo  's Pow'r  And aid my  Connal  in the doubtful Hour  Farewel ye Rocks of  Ardven  I no more  Shall from your Summit hear the Ocean roar  No more shall hear the Hunter's chearing Horn  Rousing dull Eccho with the rising Morn  Farewel ye Deer that on the Mountain Side  Crop the brown Heath or in the Fern abide  Farewel ye numerous Streams that down the Hill  Sooth'd my sad Hours with many a pleasing Rill  No more shall we returnThe Voice of War  Loud calls to ArmsOur Tombs are distant far  The APPARITION An ELEGY  UPON this Hill where constant raves the Wind  Close by a Fountain's Murmur sweet reclin'd  I listening lie while o'er my drooping Head  A single Tree spreads solitary Shade  Deep rolls the River thro' the blasted Heath  The Lake with troubled Waters swell beneath  Swift down the Hill the motly Tribe descend  No whistling Cowherds nigh at hand attend  No Hunter's Horn alarms the distant Hill  Tho' Noon the Scene is silent all and still  Sad as the Dove when by its Mate forlorn  Alone I sit the long long Day and mourn  How pleasant would the barren Heath appear  If the lov'd Mistress of my Heart were near  With her curl'd Tresses floating loose behind  While her soft Bosom kiss'd the passing Wind  But ah the Wind unwilling thence to part  Might bolt with treble Bars of Ice her Heart  She mourns her Friends that lie beneath the Hill  The Tears I'll wipe that from thine Eyes distil  And to thy Father's House while thee I bring  Sweet Comfort in my Charmer's Ear I'll sing  Ha is it she that yonder beams like Light  Or the full Lunar Orb in Autumn bright  The Sun just rising o'er a Summer Storm  Less splendid seems than her delicious Form  She speaksbut ah her Voice how weak and low  As thro' the marshy Reeds soft Breezes blow  SHE  Return'st thou safe my  Shilric  from the War  Where are thy Friends my Love they travell'd far  Of thy Destruction on the Hill they tell  I heard and wept incessant that you fell  HE  Yes I return my Love and I alone  Of all my Race beside surviveth none  No more they'll bless them in your sunny Eyes  Their Graves I pil'don yonder Plain they rise  But on the barren Turf
