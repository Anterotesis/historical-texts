 A Bold Stroke for a Husband A COMEDY AS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN By MRS COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED BY M SCOTT CHANCERYLANE FOR T EVANS PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXXXIV  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY TWO GENTLEMEN  NOW by my sanguine hopes our author cries  With expectation sparkling in her eyes  There's nothing here should scare me that I see  They all are saplings of the tough old tree  Women who wear Elysium in their look  And men unconquer'd as their native oak  But yet a word or two I'll briefly say  To prove we're right in naming of our play  Of human conduct in each varied scene  Th' extreme succeeds beyond the patient mean  If eminence in rank our bosoms fire  If merit to preferment dare aspire  Follow the active not the formal part  "And snatch a grace beyond the rules of art"  Bold Strokes  from bounding genius firmly struck  Attract success more than the turns of luck  The bankrupt swindler though to pay unable  Oft mends his fortune by the E O table  Or failing there he acts a braver part  And takes a purse  a Bold Stroke for the cart  The gamester too forgets each tender tie  And ventures his last guinea on a die  'Till ruin'd and repenting of the evil  He hangs himself  a Bold Stroke for the Devil  The fortune hunter sports a suit of lace  In this a Count a Lord in t'other place  Success at length begins his married life  At Gretna Green  a Bold Stroke for a Wife  But are bold strokes to vicious men confin'd  Does virtue lie inactive in the mind  It cannot be while England's genius breathes  And many a brow is deck'd with laurel wreaths  Bold strokes in war are England's greatest pride  Think how a HOOD has liv'd a MANNERS died  Our play holds forth the conquest of a heart  By one bold stroke of nature not of art  A female pen calls female virtue forth  And fairly shews to man her sex's worth  Could men but see what female sense can do  How apt their wit their constancyhow true  In vain would rakes the married state revile  Nor with the wanton precious time beguile  Such is our aim to rectify the age  By bringing rising follies on the stage  Be then propitious let our fears decrease  While you with plaudits ratify the peace  DRAMATIS

her music now these two years and I don't believe I could relish my breakfast without it  INIS  I would rather never break my fast than do it on such terms What a difference between your mistress and mine Donna Victoria is as much too gentle as her cousin is too harsh  MIN  Aye and you see what she gets by it had she been more spirited perhaps her husband would not have forsaken hermen enlisted under the matrimonial banner like those under the King's would be often tempted to run away from their colours if fear did not keep them in dread of desertion  INIS  If making a husband  afraid  is the way to keep him faithful I believe your lady will be the happiest wise in Spain  MIN  Ha ha ha how people may be deceivednay how people are deceivedbut time will discover all things  INIS  What

physic Sir or take poison Sirthey are to be had but what signifies bidding me take comfort when I can neither buy it beg it nor steal it  GASP  But patience will bring it Sir  CAES  'Tis false sirrahPatience is a cheat and the man that rank'd her with the cardinal virtues was a foolI have had patience at bed and board these three long years but the comfort she promis'd has never called in with a civil how d'ye  GASP  Ay Sir but you know the poets say that the twin sister and companion of comfort is good humourNow if you would but drop that agreeable acidity which is so conspicuous  CAES  Then let my daughter drop her perverse humour 'tis a more certain bar to marriage than ugliness or folly and will send me to my grave at last without male heirs  crying  How many have laid siege to her But that humour of her's like the works of Gibraltar no Spaniard can find pregnable  GASP  Ay wellTroy held out but ten yearsLet her once tell over her beads  unmarried  at fiveandtwenty and my life upon it she ends the rosary with a hearty prayer for a good husband  CAES  What d'ye expect me to wait till the horrors of old maidenism frighten her into civility No noI'll shut her up in a convent marry myself and have heirs in spite of her There's my neighbour Don Vasquez's daughter she is but nineteen  GASP  The very step I was going to recommend Sir You are but a young gentleman of sixtythree I take it and a husband of sixtythree who marries a wife of nineteen will never want heirs take my word for it  CAES  What do you joke sirrah  GASP  Oh no Sirnot if you are serious I think it would be one of the pleasantest things in the worldMadam would throw a new life into the family and when you are above stairs in the gout Sir the music of her concerts and the spirit of her converzationes would reach your sick bed and be a thousand times more comforting then flannels and panada  CAES  Come come I understand yeBut this daughter of mineI shall give her but two chances moreDon Garcia and Don Vincentio will both be here today and if she plays over the old game I'll marry tomorrow morning if I hang myself the next  GASP  You decide right Signor at sixtythree the marriage noose and the hempen noose should always go together  CAES  Why you dog you do you supposeThere's Don Garciathere he is coming through the portico Run to my daughter and bid her remember what I have said to her  Exit  GASP  She has had her lessonbut another memento mayn't be amissa young slutpretty and witty and richa match for a prince and yetbut histNot a word to my young man if I can but keep him in ignorance 'till he is married he must make the best of his bargain afterwards as other honest men have done before him  Enter  GARCIA  Welcome Don Garciawhy you are rather before your time  GARC  Gallantry forbid that I should not when a fair lady is concern'd Should Donna Olivia welcome me as frankly as you do I shall think I have been tardy  CAES  When you made your overtures Signor I understood it was from inclination to be allied to my family not from a particular passion to my daughter Have you ever seen her  GARC  But oncethat transientlyyet sufficient to convince me that she is charming  CAES  Why yes tho' I say it there are few prettier women in Madrid and she has got enemies amongst her own sex accordingly They pretend to say thatI say Sir they have reported that she is not bless'd with that kind of docility and gentleness that anow tho' she may not be so very placid and insipid as some young women yet upon the whole  GARC  Oh fye Sirnot a wordA beauty cannot be illtemper'd gratified vanity keeps her in good humour with herself and every body about her  CAES  Yes as you sayvanity is a prodigious sweetner and Olivia considering how much she has been humoured is as gentle and pliant as  Enter  MINETTE  MIN  Oh Sir shield me from my mistressShe is in one of her old tempersthe whole house is in an uproarI cannot support it  CAES  Hush  MIN  No Sir I can't hushA saint could not bear it I am tired of her tyranny and must quit her service  CAES  Then quit it in a momentgo to my steward and receive your wagesgobegone 'Tis a cousin of my daughter's she is speaking of  MIN  A cousin SirNo 'tis Donna Olivia your daughtermy mistress Oh Sir you seem to be a sweet tenderhearted young gentleman'twould move you to pity if  to Garcia  CAES  I'll move you hussey to some purpose if you don't move off  GARC  I am really confoundedcan the charming Olivia  CAES  Spite Sirmeer malice My daughter has refus'd her some cast gown or some  OLIVIA  without  Where is sheWhere is Minette  CAES  Oh 'tis all overthe tempest is coming  Enter  OLIVIA  OLIV  Oh you vile creatureto speak to meto answer meam I made to be answer'd  CAES  Daughter Daughter  During the following conversation he shews the most anxious impatience  OLIV  Because I threw my workbag at her she had the insolence to complain and on my repeating it said she would not bear itServants chuse what they shall bear  MIN  When you are married Ma'am I hope your husband will bear your humour less patiently than I have done  OLIV  My husbanddost think my husband shall contradict my will Oh I long to set a pattern to those milky wives whose mean compliances degrade the sex  GARC  Opportune  Aside  OLIV  The only husband on record who knew how to treat a wife was Socrates and tho' his lady was a Grecian I have some reason to believe her descendants match'd into our family and never shall my tame submission disgrace my ancestry  GARC  Heav'ns why have you never curb'd this intemperate spirit Don Caesar  OLIV  starting  Curb'd Sir talk thus to your groomcurbs and bridles for a woman's tongue  GARC  Not for your's lady truly 'tis too late But had the torrent now so overbearing been taken at its spring it might have been stem'd and turn'd in gentle streamlets at the master's pleasure  OLIV  A mistake friendmy spirit at its spring was too powerful for any master  GARC  Indeedperhaps you may meet a Petruchio gentle Catherine yet  OLIV  But no gentle Catherine will he find me believe itCatherine why she had not the spirit of a roasted chesnuta few big words an empty oath and a seanty dinner made her as submissive as a spaniel My fire will not be so soon extinguishedit shall resist big words oaths and starving  MIN  I believe so indeed help the poor gentleman I say to whose fate you fall  GARC  Don Caesar adieu My commiseration for your fate subdues the resentment I should otherwise feel at your endeavouring to deceive me into such a marriage  OLIV  Marriage oh mercyIs this Don Garcia  Apart to Caesar  CAES  Yes termagant  OLIV  O what a misfortune Why did you not tell me it was the gentleman you design'd to marry me to Oh Sir all that is past was in sport a contrivance between my maid and me I have no spirit at allI am as patient as poverty  GARC  This mask sits too ill on your features fair lady I have seen you  without  disguise and rejoice in your ignorance of my name since but for  that my peaceful home might have become the seat f perpetual discord  MIN  Aye Sir you would never have known what a quiet hour  OLIV  strikes her  Impertinence Indeed Sir I can be as gentle and forbearing as a pet lamb  GARC  I cannot doubt it Madam the proofs of your placidity are very strikingBut adieu though I shall pray for your conversion rather than have the honour of itI'd turn Dominican and condemn myself to perpetual celibacy  Exit  CAES  Now husseynow husseywhat do you expect  OLIV  Dear me how can you be so unreasonable did ever daughter do more to oblige a father I absolutely begg'd the man to have me  CAES  Yes vixen after you had made him detest ye what I suppose he did not hit your fancy madam tho' there is not in all Spain a man of prettier conversation  OLIV  Yes he has a very pretty kind of conversation 'tis like a parenthesis  CAES  Like a parenthesis  OLIV  Yes it might be all left out and never miss'd However I thought him a modest kind of a wellmeaning young man and that he would make a pretty sort of a husbandfor notwithstanding his blustering had I been his wife in three months he should have been as humble and complaisant as  CAES  Ay there it isthere it isthat spirit of yours hussey you can neither conquer nor conceal but I'll find a way to tame it I'll warrant me  Exit  Olivia and Minette follow him with their eyes and then burst into a laugh  MIN  Well madam I give you joy had other ladies as much success in getting lovers as you have in getting rid of yours what contented faces we should see  OLIV  But to what purpose do I get rid of them whilst they rise in succession like monthly pinks Was there ever any thing so provokingAfter some quiet and believing the men had ceased to trouble themselves about me no less than two proposals have been made to my inexorable father this very dayWhat will become of me  MIN  What shou'd become of you You'll chuse one from the pair I hope Believe me madam the only way to get rid of the impertinence of lovers is to take one and make him a scarecrow to the rest  OLIV  Oh but I cannotInvention assist me this one day  MIN  Upon my word madam invention owes you nothing and I am afraid you can draw on that bank no longerYou must trust to your established character of vixen  OLIV  But that won't frighten 'em all you know tho' it did its business with sober Don Garcia The brave General Antonio would have made a property of me in spite of every thing had I not luckily discovered his antipathy to cats and so scar'd the hero by pretending an immoderate passion for young kittens  MIN  Yes but you was still harder push'd by the Castilian Count and his engrav'd genealogy from Noah  OLIV  Oh he would have kept his post as immovably as the griffins at his gate had I not very seriously imparted to him that my mother's great uncle sold oranges in Arragon  Ha ha ha And my little delicate spark who washes in rosewater and has his bed strewed with violets would never have dismissed himself hadst thou not scented my mareschal powder with assag foetida  MIN  And pray madam if I may be so bold who is the next gentleman  OLIV  Oh Don Vincentio who distracts every body with his skill in music He ought to be married to a Viol de Gamba I bless my stars I have never yet had a miser in my liston such a character all art would be lost and nothing but an earthquake to swallow up my estate could save me  MIN  Well if some one did but know how happy would some one be that for his sake  OLIV  Now don't be impertinent Minette You have several times attempted to slide yourself into a secret which I am resolv'd to keep to myself Continue faithful and suppress your curiosity  Exit  MIN  Suppress my curiosity madamwhy I am a chambermaid and a sorry one too it should seem to have been in your confidence two years and never have got the mastersecret yet I never was six weeks in a family before but I knew every secret they had in it for three generations aye and I'll know this too or I'll blow up all her plans and declare to the world that she is no more a vixen than other fine ladiesthey have most of 'em a touch

apartment but I will be heard  seizing her hand  LAU  This insolence is not to be endured within my own walls to be thus  CAR  The time has been when within your walls I might be master  LAU  Yes you were then master of my heart  that  gave you a right which  CAR  You have now transferred to another  flinging away her hand  LAU  Well Sir  CAR  "Well Sir"Unblushing acknowledgment False fickle woman  LAU  Because I have luckily got the start of you in a few weeks I should have been the accuser and  you  the false and fickle  CAR  And to secure yourself from that disgrace you prudently looked out in time for another lover  LAU  I can pardon your sneer because you are mortified  CAR  Mortified  LAU  Yes mortified to the soul Carlos I know your sex the vainest female in the hour of her exultation and power is still outdone by man in vanity'Tis  more your ruling passion than 'tis ours and 'tis wounded  vanity  that makes you thus tremble with rage at being deserted  CAR  Stamping  Madam Madam  LAU  This rage would have been all cool insolence had I waited for your changethe crime which now appears so black in me Then whilst with all my sex's weakness I had knelt at your feet and reproached you only with my tears how  composed  would have been your feelingsScarcely would you have deigned to form a phrase of pity for me perhaps have bid me forget a man no longer worthy my attachment and recommended me to hartshorn and my women  CAR  Has any hour since I have first known you given you cause for such unjust  LAU  Yes every hourNow Carlos I bring thee to the testYou saw you lik'd you lov'd me was there no fond trusting woman whom you deserted to indulge the transient passion Yes one blest with beauty gentleness and youth one who more than her own being lov'd thee who made thee rich and whom thou mad'st thy wife  CAR  My wifehere's a turn So to revenge the quarrels of my wife  LAU  No do not mistake mewhat I have done was merely to indulge myself without more regard to your feelings than you had to her's  CAR  And you dare avow to my face that you have a passion for another  LAU  I do andfor I am above disguiseI confess so tender is my love for Florio it has scarcely left a trace of that I once avow'd for Carlos  CAR  Well Madam if I hear this without some sudden vengeance on the tongue which speaks it thank the annihilation of that passion whose remembrance is as dead in my bosom as in yours Let us however part friends and with a mutual acquittal of every obligationso give up the settlement of that estate which left me almost a beggar  LAU  Give it upha hano Carlos you consign'd me that estate as a proof of love do not imagine then I'll give up the only part of our connection of which I am not ashamed  CAR  Base woman you know 'twas not a voluntary giftafter having in vain practis'd on my fondness whilst in a state of intoxication you prevailed on me to sign the deed which you had artfully prepar'd for the purposetherefore you must restore it  LAU  Never never  CAR  Ruin is in the wordCall it back Madam or I'll be reveng'd on thee in thy heart's dearest objectthy minion Florio  he  shall not riot on my fortune  LAU  Ha ha ha Florio is safeyour lands are sold and in another country we shall enjoy the blessing of thy fond passion whilst that passion is indulging itself in hatred and execrations  Exit  CAR  My vengeance

late to look backremorse attends the past and ruinruin waits me in the future  SCENE II  Don  CAESAR  's  VICTORIA  enters perusing a letter enter  OLIVIA  OLIV  Speaks as entering  To be sureif my father should enquire for me tell him I am in Donna Victoria's apartmentSmiling I protest my dear gloomy cousin where have you purchased that sunshiny look  VICT  It is but April sunshine I fear but who could resist  such  a temptation to smile a letter from Donna Laura my husband's mistress stiling me her dearest Florio her life her soul and complaining of a twelve hours absence as the bitterest misfortune  OLIV  Ha ha ha most doughty Don pray let us see you in your feather and doublet as a Cavaleiro it seems you are formidable So suddenly to rob your husband of his charmer's heart you must have us'd some witchery  VICT  Yes powerful witcherythe knowledge of my sex Oh did the men but know us as well as we do ourselvesbut thank fate they do not 'twould be dangerous  OLIV  What I suppose you prais'd her understanding was captivated by her wit and absolutely struck dumb by the amazing beauties of  her mind  VICT  Oh nothat's the mode prescribed by the  Essayists  on the female heartha ha haNot a woman breathing from fifteen to fifty but would rather have a compliment to the tip of her ear or the turn of her ancle than a volume in praise of her intellects  OLIV  So flattery then is your boasted pill  VICT  No that's only the occasional gilding but 'tis in vain to attempt a description of what changed its nature with every moment I was now attentivenow gaythen tenderthen careless I strove rather to convince her that  I was charming  than that I myself was charm'd and when I saw love's arrow quivering in her heart instead of falling at her feet sung a triumphant air and remember'd a sudden engagement  OLIV  Archly  Would you have done so had you been a man  VICT  Assuredlyknowing what I now do as a woman  OLIV  But can all this be worth while merely to rival a sickle husband with one woman whilst he is setting his feather perhaps at half a score others  VICT  To rival him was not my first motive The Portugueze robbed me of his heart I concluded she had fascinations which nature had denied to me it was impossible to visit her as a woman I therefore assumed the Cavalier to study her that I might if possible be to my Carlos all he found in her  OLIV  Pretty humble creature  VICT  In this adventure I learnt more than I expectedmy oh cruel my husband has given this woman an estate almost all that his dissipations had left us  OLIV  Indeed  VICT  To make him more culpable it was my estate it was that fortune which my lavish love had made his without securing it to my children  OLIV  How could you be so improvident  VICT  Alas I trusted him with my heart with my happiness  without  restriction Should I have shewn a greater solicitude for any thing than for these  weeps  OLIV  The event proves that you should but how can you be thus passive in your sorrow since I had assum'd the man I'd make him feel a man's resentment for such injuries  VICT  Oh Olivia what resentment can I shew to him I have vow'd to honour and whom both my duty and my heart compel me yet to love  OLIV  Why really now I thinkpositively there's no thinking about it 'tis among the arcana of the married life I suppose  VICT  You who know me can judge how I suffered in prosecuting my plan I have thrown off the delicacy of sex I have worn the mask of love to the destroyer of my peacebut the object is too great to be abandonednothing less than to save my husband from ruin and to restore him again a lover to my faithful bosom  OLIV  Well I confess Victoria I hardly know whether most to blame or praise you but with the rest of the world I suppose your success will determine me  Enter  GASPER  GASP  Pray Madam are your wedding shoes ready  to Olivia  OLIV  Insolence I can scarcely ever keep up the vixen to this fellow  apart to Victoria  GASP  You'll want them Ma'am to morrow morning that's allso I came to prepare ye  OLIV  I  want wedding shoes tomorrow if you are kept on water gruel 'till I marry that plump face of yours will be chapfall'n I believe  GASP  Yes truly I believe so too Lackaday did you suppose I came to bring you news of your own wedding no such glad tidings for you lady believe meYou married I am sure the man who ties himself to you ought to be half a salamander and able to live in fire  OLIV  What marriage then is it you do me the honour to inform me of  GASP  Why your father's marriage You'll have a motherinlaw tomorrow and having like a dutiful daughter danced at the wedding be immur'd in a convent for life  OLIV  Immur'd in a convent then I'll raise sedition in the sisterhood depose the abbess and turn the confessor's chair to a gocart  GASP  So the threat of the motherinlaw which I thought would be worse than that of the abbess does not frighten ye  OLIV  No because my father dares not give me oneMarry without my consent no no he'll never think of it depend on't however lest the fit should grow strong upon him I'll go and administer my volatiles to keep it under  Exit  GASP  Administer 'em cautiously thentoo strong a dose of your volatiles would make the fit stubborn Who'd think that pretty arch look belong'd to a termagant what a pity 'twould be worth a thousand ducats to cure her  VICT  Has Inis told you I wanted to converse with you in private Gasper  GASP  Oh yes madam and I took particular notice that it was to be in privateSure says I Mrs Inis Madam Victoria has not taken a fancy to me and is going to break her mind  VICT  Whimsical ha ha suppose I should Gasper  GASP  Why then madam I should say fortune had used you dev'lish scurvily to give me a grey beard in a livery I know well enough

forwardness  the censure will fall on my lady if he should be pleas'd with my  person  the advantage will be mine But perhaps he's come here on some wicked frolic or otherI'll watch him at a distance before I speak  Exit  Enter  JULIO  JULIO  Not here 'faith though she gave me last night but a faint refusal and I had a right by all the rules of gallantry to construe that into an assentThen she's a jiltHang her I feel I am uneasyThe first woman that ever gave me painI am asham'd to perceive that this spot has attractions for me only because it was here I convers'd with her 'Twas here the little syren  conscious of her charms unveil'd her fascinating face'Twas here  Enter  GARCIA  and  VINCENTIO  GARC  'Twas here  that Julio leaving champaigne untasted and songs of gallantry unsung came to talk to the whistling branches  VIN  'Twas here  that Julio flying from the young and gay was found in doleful meditation  altering his tone  on a wench for a hundred ducats  GARC  Who is she  JULIO  Not Donna Olivia Gentlemen not Donna Olivia  GARC  We have been seeking you to ask the event of your visit to her  JULIO  The event has prov'd that  you  have been most grosly dup'd  VIN  I knew thatHa ha ha  JULIO  And you likewise  I  know thatHa ha haThe sair lady so far from being a vixen is the very essence of gentleness To me so much sweetness in a wife wou'd be downright maukishI like the little acerbities which flow from quick spirits and a consciousness of powerOne may as well marry a lookingglass as a woman who constantly reflects back one's own sentiments and one's own whims  VIN  Well but she's fond of a Jew's harp  JULIO  Detests it she would be as fond of  a Jew  GARC  Pho pho this is a game at cross purposesLet us all go to Don Caesar's together and compare opinions on the spot  JULIO  I'll go most willinglybut it will be only to cover you both with confusion for being the two men in Spain most easily impos'd on  All going  Enter  MINETTE  MIN  Gentlemen my lady has sent me for one of you pray which of you is it  JULIO  Returning  Me without doubt child  VIN  I don't know that  GARC  Look at me my dear don't you think I am the man  MIN  Let me seea good air and well made you are the man for a dancer  to Garcia  Well dress'd and nicely put out of handsyou are the man for a bandbox  to Vincentio  Handsome and boldyou are the man for my lady  to Julio  JULIO  My dear little Iris here's all the gold in my pocketGentlemen I wish you a good nightI am your very obedient humble  stalking by them with his arm round Minette  GARC  Pho prithee don't be a fool Are we not going to Donna Olivia  JULIO  Donna Olivia must wait my dear boy we can decide about her tomorrow Come along my little dove of Venus  Exit  GARC  What a rash fellow it is ten to one but this is some common business and he'll be robb'd and murder'dthey take him for a stranger  VIN  Let's follow and see where she leads him  GARC  That's hardly fair however as I think there's danger we will follow  Exit  SCENE DON CAESAR'S  Enter  OLIVIA  and  SERVANT  OLIV  Bring me my veil and follow me to the Prado  Exit Servant  Julio will certainly be therehe has too much breeding not to translate my positive denial into assentat least I must convince myself If I see him compleatly vanquish'd I can by the most  unlucky chance in the world  drop a card with my name and then all the rest follows in course  Exit  Enter  MINETTE  and  JULIO  MIN  There Sir please to sit down 'till my lady is ready to wait on youshe won't be long I'm sure she's out and I may do great things before she returns  aside  Exit  JULIO  Through fifty back lanes a long garden and a narrow staircase into a superb apartmentall that's in the regular way as the Spanish women manage it one intrigue is too much like another whilst the sprightly dames of Paris have the art of giving the same intrigue every day a new air Now presently in comes a stately dame with a veil on she tells me she fears I have but a slight opinion of her virtue I make her an answer about her beauty and after a dozen or two entreaties and denials off comes her veil A fat matron perhaps of fortyI swear she's a Hebeshe thinks me very obliging and I find her very grateful and this is the epitome of half the amours in Madrid If it was not now and then for the little lively fillip of a jealous husband or brother which obliges one to leap from a window or crawl like a cat along the gutters there would be no bearing the  ennui  Ah ah but this promises novelty  looking through the wing  a young girl and an old manwife or daughter They are coming this way My lovely incognita by all that's propitious Why did not some kind  spirit whisper to me my happiness but holdshe can't mean to treat the old gentleman with a sight of me  goes behind the sopha  Enter  CAESAR  and  OLIVIA  CAES  No no Madam no going outgive me your veil that will be useless 'till you put it on for life There madam this is your  apartment  your  house  your  garden  your  assembly  'till you go to your convent Why how impudent you are to look thus unconcern'dCan hardly forbear laughing in my faceVery wellvery well  Exit double locking the door  OLIV  Ha ha ha I'll be even with you my dear father if you treble lock it I'll stay here two days without once asking for my liberty and you'll come the  third  with tears in your eyes to take me outHe has forgot that door leading to the gardenbut I vow I'll stay  sitting down  I can make the time pass pleasantly enough  JULIO  I hope so  looking over the back of the sopha  OLIV  Heav'n and earth  JULIO  My dear creature why are you so alarmed am I here before you expected me  coming round  OLIV  Expected you  JULIO  Oh this pretty surprize Come let us sit down I think your father was very obliging to lock us in together  OLIV  Sir Sir my father  calling at the door  CAES  without  Aye 'tis all in vainI won't come near you There you are and there you may stayI shan't return make as much noise as you will  JULIO  Why are you not asham'd that your father has so much more consideration for your guest than you have  OLIV  My guest how is it possible he can have discover'd me  aside  JULIO  Pho this is carrying the thing further than you needif there was a third person here it might be prudent  OLIV  Why this assurance Don Julio is really  JULIO  The thing in the world you are most ready to pardon  OLIV  Upon my word I don't know how to treat you  JULIO  Consult your heart  OLIV  I shall consult my honour  JULIO  Honour is a pretty thing to play with but when spoken with that very grave face after having sent your maid to bring me here is really more than I expected I shall be in an ill humour presentlyI won't stay if you treat me thus  OLIV  Well this is superior to every thing I have heard that men will slander women privately to each other 'tis their common amusement but to do it to one's faceand you really pretend that I sent for you  JULIO  Ha ha ha Well if it obliges you I will pretend that you did not send for me that your maid did not conduct me hither nay that I have not now the supreme happiness  catching her in his arms  Enter  MINETTE  screams and runs out  JULIO  Donna Olivia de Zuniga how the devil came she here  OLIV  Aside  That's lucky Olivia my dear friend why do you run away Keep the character I charge you  apart to Minette  Be still Olivia  MIN  Oh dear madam I wasI was so frighten'd when I saw that gentleman  OLIV  Oh my dear it's the merriest pretty kind of gentleman in the world he pretends that I sent my maid for him into the streets ha ha  JULIO  That's right always tell a thing yourself which you wou'd not have believ'd  MIN  It is the readiest excuse for being found in a lady's apartment however Now will I swear I know nothing of the matter  aside  OLIV  Now I think it a horrid poor excuse he has certainly not had occasion to invent reasons for such impertinencies often Tell me that he has made love to you to day  apart  MIN  I fancy that he  has  had occasion to excuse impertinencies oftenhis impertinence to me today  JULIO  To you madam  MIN  Making love to me my dear all the morningcould hardly get him away he was so desirous to speak to my father Nay Sir I don't care for your impatience  JULIO  Aside  Now wou'd I give a thousand pistoles if she were a man  OLIV  Nay then this accidental meeting is fortunatepray Don Julio don't let my presence prevent your saying what you think proper to my friendshall I leave you together  JULIO  Apart  To contradict a lady on such an assertion wou'd be too gross but upon my honour Donna Olivia is the last woman upon earth who cou'd inspire  me with a tender idea Find an excuse to send her away my angel I entreat you I have a thousand things to say and the moments are too precious to be given to her  OLIV  I think so too but one can't be rude you know Come my dear sit down  seating herself  have you brought your work  JULIO  The devil what can she mean  pushing himself between Minette and the sopha  Donna Olivia I am sorry to inform you that my physician has just been sent for to your father Don CaesarThe poor gentleman was seized with a vertigo  OLIV  Vertigoes Oh he has 'em frequently you know  to Minette  MIN  Yes and they always keep me from his sight  JULIO  Did ever one women prevent another from leaving her at such a moment before I really madam cannot comprehend  CAESAR  without  It is impossibleimpossible gentlemen Don Julio cannot be here  JULIO  Hah who's that  Enter  CAESAR GARCIA  and  VINCENTIO  GARC  There did we not tell you so we saw him enter the garden  CAES  What can be the meaning of all this A man in my daughter's apartment  attempting to draw  GARC  Hold Sir Don Julio is of the first rank in Spain and will unquestionably be able to satisfy your honour without troubling your swordWe have done mischief Vincentio  apart  JULIO  to Olivia  They have been cursedly impertinent but I'll bring you off never fear by pretending a passion for your busy friend there  CAES  Satisfy me then in a moment speak one of you  JULIO  I came here Sir by the merest accidentThe garden door was open curiosity led me to this apartmentYou came in a moment after and very civilly lock'd me in with your daughter  CAES  Lock'd you in why then did you not like a man of honour cry out  JULIO  The lady cried out Sir and you told her you would not return but when Donna Olivia de Zuniga entered for whom I have conceived a most violent passion  CAES  A passion for her Oh let me hear no more on'tA passion for her You may as well entertain a passion for the untameable hyaena  GARC  There Vincentio what think you now Xantippe or not  VIN  I am afraid I must give up thatbut pray support me as to this point Don Caesar is not the lady fond of a Jew's harp  CAES  Fond She's fond of nothing but playing the vixen there is not such a fury upon earth  JULIO  These are odd liberties with a person who does not belong to him  CAES  I'll play the hypocrite for her no more the world shall know her true character they shall knowbut ask her maid there  JULIO  Her maid  MIN  Why yes Sir to say truth I am but Donna Olivia's maid after all  OLIV  Apart  Dear Minette speak for me or I am now ruin'd  MIN  I will ma'amI must confess Sir  going up to Julio  there never was so bitter a temper'd creature as my lady is I have borne her humours for two years I have seen her by night and by day  Olivia pulls her sleeve impatiently  I will I will  to Olivia  and this I am sure that if you marry her you'll rue the day every hour the first month and hang yourself the next There madam I have done it roundly now  OLIV  I am undoneI am caught in my own snare  aside  CAES  After this true character of my daughter I suppose Signor we shall hear no more of your passion so let us go down and leave madam to begin her penance  JULIO  My ideas are totally confus'dYou Donna Olivia de Zuniga and the person I thought you her maid something too flattering darts across my mind  CAES  If you have taken a fancy to her maid I have nothing farther to say but as to that violent creature  JULIO  Oh do not prophane herWhere is that spirit which you tell me of Is it that which speaks in modest conscious blushes on her cheeks Is it that which bends her lovely eyes to earth  CAES  Ay she's only bending 'em to earth considering how to afflict me with some new obstinacyshe'll break out like a tygress in a moment  JULIO  It cannot be  are  you charming woman such a creature  OLIV  Yes to all mankindbut one  looking down  JULIO  But one Oh might that excepted one be me  OLIV  Wou'd you not fear to trust your fate with her you have cause to think so hateful  JULIO  No I'd bless the hour that bound my fate to her'spermit me Sir to pay my vows to this fair vixen  CAES  What are you such a bold man as that Pho but if you are 'twill be only lost timeshe'll contrive some way or other to return your vows upon your hands  OLIV  If they have your authority Sir I will return themonly with my own  CAES  What's that what did she say my head is giddy with surprize  JULIO  And mine with rapture  catching her hand  CAES  Don't make a fool of me OliviaWil't marry him  OLIV  When you command me Sir  CAES  My dear Don Julio thou art my guardian angelshall I have a soninlaw at last Garcia Vincentio cou'd you have thought it  GARC  No Sir if we had we should have sav'd that lady much trouble 'tis pretty clear now  why  she was a vixen  VIN  Yes yes 'tis clear enough and I beg your pardon madam for the share of trouble  I  gave youbut pray have the goodness to tell me sincerely what do you think of a crash  OLIV  I love music Don Vincentio I admire your skill and whenever you'll give me a concert I shall be oblig'd  VIN  You cou'd not have pleas'd me so well if you had married me  Enter  CARLOS  and  VICTORIA  OLIV  Hah here comes Victoria and her Carlos  My friend you are happy'tis in your eyes I need not ask the event  CAES  What is this Don Carlos whom Victoria gave us for a cousin Sir you come in happy hour  CAR  I do indeed for I am most happy  JULIO  My dear Carlos what has new made thee thus since morning  CAR  A wife Marry Julio marry  JULIO  What this advice from  you  CAR  Yes and when you have married an angel when that angel has done for you such things as makes your gratitude almost equal to your love you may then guess something of what I feel in calling  this  angel mine  OLIV  Now I trust Don Julio after all this that if I should do you the honour of my hand you'll treat me cruelly be a very bad man that I like my exemplary cousin  VICT  Hold Olivia it is not necessary that a husband should be  faulty  to make a wife's character  exemplary  Should he be tenderly watchful of your happiness your gratitude will give a thousand graces to your conduct whilst the purity of your manners and the nice honour of your life will gain you the approbation of those whose praise is fame  OLIV  Pretty and matronly thank you my dear We have each struck a bold stroke todayyour's has been to reclaim a husband mine to get one but the most important is yet to be obtain'dThe approbation of our judges  That meed withheld our labours have been vain  Pointless  my  jests and doubly keen your pain  Might we their plaudits and their praise provoke  Our  bold  should then be term'd a  happy  stroke  THE END  EPILOGUE  BY A GENTLEMAN  YOUR servant friends from Spain you see I'm come  A peace abroadbut is it peace at home  The sword is sheath'd our heroes all are quiet  A  gentle  woman I and hate a riot  To pick a lover from a croud of beaus  A ladystroke though bold you'll scarce oppose  To night you've had a trial of our skill  In curing lethargy that growing ill  That lifeless inattention and neglect  Which some deserve some fear and some expect  Say do you like our scheme methinks I hear  A reverend sire beyond his sixtieth year  In grumbling accents saying "Stuff sad stuff  "Now there's a peace you may have men enough  "They want a leg perhaps what's that to you  "They're  Frenchmen only  who make use of  two  "Then stay your whining let your bold strokes cease  "Each wound in war is a bold stroke for peace"  How weak your wit ye lords of the creation  When set to find a woman's inclination  Her heart though ice the virgin fair and young  Without an ear with double share of tongue  Let the fond youth she likes but once appear  His dulcet voice with rapture she can hear  If she cou'd frown by smiles her pride's disarm'd  She  has  a heart when  love  that heart has warm'd  No tones discordant now not even nay  While sighs to sighs responsive seem to say  In accents sweet"love honour and obey"  Dear liberty farewell from babe to wife  I've led a pretty happy checquer'd life  I'll tell you how the tale's not very long  But if you please I'll give it you in song  AIR  When I was a little baby  Plump and round as may be  For a lullaby  I'd fret and cry  When I was a little baby  But at six years old how froward  Naughty girl untoward  To dress my doll  And prate like poll  A naughty girl untoward  At twelve what a blooming flower  Around me every hour  Butterflies gay  To sip and play  Flew round this blooming flower  At sweet sixteen so pretty  All I said was witty  A charming lass  So said my glass  At dear sixteen so pretty  Love's dart no more to parry  At twentytwo to marry  To one dear youth  I plight my truth  And that's the youth I'll marry  With him I'll toy and play so  He'll wonder why I stay so  But your applause  Must crown my cause  So clap your hands and say so  FINIS  Of the  PUBLISHER  may be had  By the same AUTHOR  The BELLE's STRATAGEM a Comedy  The RUNAWAY a Comedy  WHICH IS THE MAN a Comedy  ALBINA a Tragedy  WHO's THE DUPE a
