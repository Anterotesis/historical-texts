 LIBERAL OPINIONS UPON ANIMALS MAN AND PROVIDENCE  In which are introduced ANECDOTES OF A GENTLEMAN  Addressed to the Right Hon Lady CH***THâ–ª  FROM GAY TO GRAVE FROM LIVELY TO SEVERE  Pope  By COURTNEY MELMOTH  VOL I  LONDON Printed for G ROBINSON and J BEW in PaternosterRow and Sold by J WALTER CharingCross  MDCCLXXV  PREFACE  IT was not till I had read this book in print that I thought about a Preface but on reviewing it prior to publication I am convinced that a Preface is absolutely necessary a single period however will comprize it  In the course of these volumes it is possible the reader may meet with some  sentiments which at first sight seem unfavourable to the interests of virtue and to the laws of moral life As the direct contrary is all along intended to be strongly inculcated the author begs those who think proper to turn over his pages will not abruptly decide on any particular passages which appear liable to objection but have patience enough to go calmly on and forbear to pass judgment till they have fairly seen the whole of his arguments  Having thus briefly invited from the reader a candid perusal I will only detain him a moment longer to hear a short account of the work The miscellaneous matter here offered is the result of various  efforts submitted at various opportunities to the author's literary friends the drudgery of correction has been obligingly undertaken by those friends to whom he confesses himself indebted not so much for the ardour of particular compliment as for the frankness of general criticism  The poetical parts when first written were each designed to stand alone particularly the Elegy of a Nightingale and the Epistle from an Unfortunate Lady to her Family The Anecdotes of a Gentleman are extracted from a larger work of which what is now presented is little more than the introduction The primary pages treat of  Animals and this part of the performance consists of moral Fancypieces from which we proceed to the investigation of Facts In short though I have been somewhat immethodical I have not been totally unconnected and that I might not tire by symstematic sameness I have varied my style as often as I varied my subject  Notwithstanding these kind corrections however a very ingenious and wellknown gentleman whose acquaintance with the author is unluckily of later date has still discovered some things which the writer wishes had not escaped the eyes of others Perhaps they did not escape there is a coy reluctance to find fault and a dread  of being too honest in cases of private criticism often fatal and a writer's reputation is frequently forfeited by literary conceit on the one hand and a scrupulous delicacy on the other  These volumes were ready for publication when the gentleman of whom I last spoke drew a judicious pen over such sentences as he thought might still gain a grace from alteration but it was too late to avail myself of his taste and sincerity or the reader would have received a more finished amusement However should the performance thus  sent to its account With its imperfections on its head  have merit enough to please the public the indulgence shall be repaid by the author's care to correct his errors in a future edition  LIBERAL OPINIONS c  I Am more obliged to you madam than I can find language for acknowledgment A sentiment of your ladyship's has revived a train of ideas in my mind which I have at length determined to indulgeBe not alarmed The sentiment like the subject is full of humanity Ill fare the heart whose tender bias is circumscribed by the paltry trammels of selflove and  can withhold its benevolence from the minutest part of animated life There is a deplorable illiberality in the affections of the vulgar narrowly bigotted to one mean set of notions and confirmed by the ungenerous maxims that have been inculcated in the early periods of life they seldom or never rise to a single sentiment which reflects dignity either on the head or heart and the feelings of above half mankind are totally guided by the most contracted and partial prejudices  In contradiction of these limited rationals and in defiance of customary impositions I have the fortitude to think and judge for myselfI look on the animal world as very nearly connected with me and thus publicly  declare myself the sincere wellwisher of every living thing I am now going to address your ladyship upon some very interesting subjects but as they may possibly lengthen my enquiries beyond the limits of my present design I shall beg leave to divide my letter into several parts both for the relief of your attention and to afford an opportunity to pause till it is agreeable to your ladyship to resume the book  THE TITLE  I have called this treatiseLiberal Opinions upon interesting Subjects the principal of which relate to men  Providence and animals I chose this miscellaneous title to give myself a free scope and to receive a sanction for indulging speculations not absolutely tied down to the rules of writing By this however I do not mean to run riot in the wilderness of modern digression but if by turning a little out of the beaten path I can catch an observation or pick up a sentiment neglected by such literary travellers as set out like a plodding mechanic with an inflexible resolution to jog strait forwards though they might enjoy the most beautiful prospects by the slightest deviationsat the same time that an obstinate attachment to the old track presents nothing to the eye which has any novelty to recommend it nor any thing to the mind that  can give varied gratificationThere is a sad insipidity in those compositions which are fettered by the chains of criticism Like the gardens of a citizen we have regularity without beauty and uniformity without taste The images stand immodestly staring upon each other in exact lines the busts are placed skulking like q's in a corner as equidistant as the rule can measure their spaces while their trees alcoves and hedges smug as their master's wigs are cut in the most preposterous manner and excite the ridicule of every sensible passenger Among the countless quantity of books in our language there are very few madam that abound in original thought The multiplication of copies is infinite  and yet it seldom happens that the reader is presented with any fresh instruction or unhackneyed entertainment I mention not this because I would have you believe I have hit upon a new vein in the minebut as it serves my purpose of making a remark or two on  THE PREJUDICES OF WRITERS AND READERS  The power of education is as strong madam as the appetites of nature and in nothing more than the habits of writer and reader Most of those who publish their sentiments have spent their lives rather  in turning over volumes than in tracing accurately the shifting scene with intent to enrich themselves with original ideasrather in reading than in thinking On the other hand the majority of those who are most eager after the perusal of books are directed by their tutors to read a certain class on the faith and credit of which they are to form their future maxims opinions and behaviour Thus both readers and writers go in leadingstrings The one reprint what has been printed by others with some slight alteration the other consider those tenets incontestible which they have found in their favourite authors or heard from the lips of friends or masters probably under equal prejudices  There are indeed certain selfevident propositions the truth of which like the sun at noon strike unobstructed light upon the mind To cavil or conjecture against these would be to war with demonstration and combat with truth and heaven There are also a variety of opinions rendered awful by the general belief of men which have been adopted as maxims out of the reach of confutation Upon this account if at any time a man hath dared to oppose any notion which hath been handed down from father to son with the same care as the rentrolls of the family estatewhich was put into our mouths with the milk of our mothers and pinned upon our understandings as early as the bibs on our bosomswhat is the consequence  He is condemned as a dangerous innovator as one who would overset the established system of thingsa system which antiquity and truth have made venerable and decisiveStrange bigotry'tis a dependency madam beneath the natural freedom of the mind An intellectual obligation is as servile as a pecuniary oneone would not indeed like Mandeville oppose every thing from the obstinate tenacity of founding a new system upon the ruins of the oldfor that were as absurd as setting fire to one's house because some flaws and errors were perceptible through the buildingbut it would methinks be an act of wisdom to do one's best to repair it I have said thus much as an excuse for some peculiar  sentiments which will be distributed through this letter It is likely that I may advance opinions not wholly correspondent to the general imitation of thinking for I am sorry to say that our usual ideas are derived from a very silly and servile imitationthe most sensible people are frequently parrotsthey think as they are bid to think and talk the dull dialect of their teachers from the cradle to the coffin A man of original contemplation is a prodigy and like a prodigy the eyes of every body are upon him the moment he appears even the few which are pleased with his fortitude admit the very conviction they feel with some reluctancefor we part from nothing we have any length of time been accustomed  to veneratewithout pain Thus many people who have talents for speculation check the impulse to speculate through a dislike of being particular Genius therefore rusts in inactivity and men content themselves with going on in the old road to avoid the charge of singularity and the smiles of derision I have ventured however madam to give the rein to my inclination and shall ramble from the beaten way of literary traffic as often as it seems necessary to the discussion of topics which will at least afford an ample field of liberal inquiry and innocent investigation  SKETCH OF AN ANIMAL SOCIETY  I have as your ladyship will remember already declared myself the friend of all the inhabitants which wing the air or crawl upon the earth and although I have the tenderest attachment to my own species and glory in the name of man and christian yetif in my travels through the world I happen as is sometimes the case to meet in the brute the insect or reptile those endearing qualities which I look for amongst men in vain I hesitate not to strike a bargain on the spotform a strict alliance with the more rational animal and only  lament that it is possible for those who have dominion over the creation to be outdone by beings of an inferior order in the scale of life  Having said thus much your ladyship will not wonder if in this letter I should say something in defence of those gentle domestics which accompany us in our retirements But of all creatures that are accommodated with four feet I am most enamoured of lapdogs yet I admire almost every sort of dumb companions amongst which I have now lived with little of other society for five years Will your ladyship please to hear a description of my family  Suppose me madam at my own house if I presume not in calling that a house which consists of a single  storybe it then in my cottage for that is the term which humility would give it you behold me sitting before a frugal fire with my little partakers of the blaze around methat cat which sits sage and thinking on the edge of the form is not more remarkable for her beauty of person than for the uncommon accomplishments of her mind I say mind because I am persuaded and out of doubt as to that particular the tricktrying kitten which is busied in chasing her shadow round the room inherits all the genius of her motherbut has a small spice of the coquette in her temper yet this is so common to pretty young females and so naturally wears off when they arrive at the gravity of  cathood besides it being graceful in kittenhood that it were a needless severity to check it the activity and fun of the creature as she skips sidelong in wanton attitudes and antics is now and then so pleasantly burlesque that the inflexible muscles of you old wretch of a pointer stretched in slumber along the hearth almost relax into a grin and sometimes the veteran is so inspired by the mimickry of little puss that he raises his pawgives her a pat of encouragement and discovers all the playfulness of a puppyThere is in this place so fair an opportunity of trying my skill as a writer that I cannot resist making  A COMPARISON  Did you never take notice madam of two people of different ages suddenly attracted to each other by the sympathy of ideas Nothing but the power of pleasant thoughts can effect an association the old man sits a long time smothered up in the mist of his own melancholy he hangs his head upon his breast fixes his eyes over the fire and seems to be employed in some profound speculation the fatigue however of thinking proves too laborious and he is at length rocked to sleep in the cradle of his reflections In the mean time his favourite boy is left to cater for himself The eye of a child converts every trifle into an object of entertainment  and every pretty unimportance is esteemed a joyful acquisition The father after the refreshments of his nap that nepenthe of age awakes the stripling is acting the kitten on the floor and ingeniously exerts a thousand little efforts to vary its amusement Age surveys the picture and recalls ideas which bring to mind the moments when he was himself the happy harlequin of the carpet a tear drops involuntarily which is succeeded by a smile At length the distance of ages is forgotten the veteran is caught in the charm of chearful retrospection forgets awhile the decrepitude of the last stage and mixes in the whimsical and puerile gratifications of the first  You see madam here were too many flowers to remain uncropt It  would have been unpardonable for a young writer to let them wither and  Waste their sweetness on the desart air  I have made up my nosegayand am now ready to return with your ladyship to  MY FAMILY  Scampering up that shelf sports an animal of peculiar pleasantry It is Trimbrush my squirrel madam a very ingenious sprightly and whimsical fellowthe macaroni of animals full as mischievousfull as coxcomic and a great deal more witty than many a sine gentleman whose advantages have been greater His many  entertaining conceits and the laughable manner in which he sometimes amuses himself have acquired him the name of the Humourist  Apes monkies pies and parrots I have none They were so assuming and so saucy a set of domestics and so arrogantly tyrannized over the pacific and meekminded part of my family that I e'en discarded them from the society They now reside with characters for whom they are very proper companions My apes are in the possession of certain Mimics which caricature the excellence and talents of others because they have neither talents or excellence of their own and it is expected that the eldest maleape will make his first public appearance next winter in the character of  a modern Lecturerto which will be added a farce of burlesque imitations My monkies I have presented to a beau and they are supposed to furnish him with hints which enable him to lead the fashionso that your ladyship perceives the bon ton are not a little indebted even to the excommunicated part of my familyas to my parrots pies and birds of speech they are all the property of an unmar ried maiden gentlewoman who is so extremely celebrated for volubility of conversation and so unfatigued a continuer that nothing human could ever come in for a word and yet she loves to hear nonsense as well as talk it I am told by a friend that my dumb orators arealmosta match for her Must it not be a charming concord  of sounds when every instrument is in tuneI was once at the concert myselfand the confusion of tongues must have been order and intelligence to it Poll screamedmag chatteredthe monkies squeaked and the lady with a note above them all laboured hard for that charter of her sex the last word The day of their departure was celebrated by my creatures as a jubilee my cats purredmy dogs gamboledmy squirrel danced a new cotilion on the occasion and my birds which you hear are no bad musicians whistled a fresh overture  I beg your ladyship will honour that owl blinking on his perch in the corner with particular attention He is known in my family by the name of the Feathered Philosopher and that  fair creature uxoriously nestling under his left pinion is his spouse and a Poetess of no mean charactershall I let your ladyship into  A SECRET  The sage personages above mentioned were some time since in London and the intimate companions of some town owls and it has been seriously averred to me by some of the trade that several poems a collection of essaysseveral medical compositions and a very large bundle of political papers under a variety of signatures together with sixteen volumes of sermonswarranted to be originals and published from authentic manuscripts now in the possession  of many right reverend owlswere the jointlabours of this literary and ingenious but unfortunate couple In what incidents consist their misfortune your ladyship will see when I come to communicate their secret historywhich history will abound I trust with as miraculous escapes surprising adventures marvellous turns of fortuneprovidential deliverances entertaining transitions and accurate delineations of life and character as were ever relatedand in this presumptionI am so certain of the fact that I shall not give up the point even to the wonderful Robinson Crusoe himself And now madam I beseech you to cast a kind eye on that exquisite little thing ruminating on his rug'tis my  HISTORIAN  The Isaac of dogsthe Benjamin of animals Never sure in man or beast resided more gratitude or more sensibility Behold his bosom is grown grey in my society Many a time when the storms of the world have blown hard upon my head even till the violence of the shock assailed my heartwhen the eye of friendship became inverted by ill success and when I looked in vain around me for the benevolence of sympathy and the consolations of human attachment in those destitute moments to the shame of man came that affectionate adherentand with an officiousness of love which wanted not the eloquence  of words to be understood taught me to take refuge in resignation and in his company set at defiance the malice of vicissitude That very creature has made the grand tour and returned at last in a good old age to his chimney corner and houshold gods fraught with wisdom and experience He was tutor to the puppy of a nobleman who was indeed but a dull dog himself Tripsea however for so is my favourite called though he could make no wise impressions on the young heir did not neglect to enrich himself with all the policy maxims manners government and constitution of every country through which he passed His thirst of foreign knowledge was indeed so remarkable and his inquiries  so minute that he can bark upon those subjects with as much fluency as any traveller upon earthand this it is which makes him one or another the most entertaining animal that ever crossed the Atlantic It was this creature which confirmed me in the belief that the partition betwixt instinct and reason was totally transparent and that the animal and rational saw through very similar mirrors Tripsea is the delight of my societynay he is at this time president of a canine club of which he is the life and soulfor they being a set of ignorant countrybred dogs he plays his own game with them and to say the truth he does sometimes so bamboozle the creatures with touches of the stupendous as travellers you  know madam are apt to use a long bowthat he makes every particular hair to stand an end upon their backsYet the veriest cur of the county is openmouthed to swallow the news and all to a dog admire his parts and confess the power of travel I believe Tripsea is at this very time preparing a journal for the press in which the public may expect a collection of remarks not inferior to any extant with notes critical and explanatory on the errors and abuses of other historians As for the right honourable and drowsy whelp who was the companion of Tripsea his business abroad was pretty much like his business at homehe straggled about the streetslifted up a naughty leg against the public buildingskept  a mistress in a cornerintrigued with a lady of the courthad an affair of honour with the poor dog of a husbandgot worried by a bravoseized by an officer of justice whined out six days in prison and wrote a fawning letter to the animal of a minister to release himbut at length as destitute of wisdom as of every thing else that is valuable he is returnedthe hopeful and eldest son of the ancient family of the Joltersand his present employment is to talk highly of the great advantages of finishing one's education abroad in order to persuade other puppies to follow his exampleBut the improvements of Tripsea madamthe harvest of exotic instruction which that dear seriouslooking creature has  in storebuthushhe barks Artful animal I know the reason see madam he leaps upon my lap Aye aye I thought soI hope your ladyship will pardon himas he is in treaty with a bookseller about his Authentic Memoirs and has almost disposed of the copyrighthe whispers me his opinion that it would be ungenteel to publish any anecdotes beforehand and might hurt the sale For your ladyship will be pleased to understand that there has been of late a surprising revolution in the world of literaturebrains however manufactured sell now for little or nothing for the longest and wisest heads in the nation have discovered that there is nothing within and consequently nothing that come out  which can reasonably be considered as property 'Tis all a caput mortuum and past any sort of doubt that the inside even of a privy counsellor's skull is not worth half the value of the wig that covers it This being the case Tripsea is certainly in the right to make the best of his manuscript  My family then madam briefly stands thus  A tabby cat Descended from Mr Gray's Selima  A tortoisecoloured kitten  A pointerof Spanish extraction  A philosophicalmedicalmetaphycalpoliticalcritical owl  An essayicalpoeticalepigrammatical owless  A social squirrel A humourist  An historicalgeographical lapdogthird son to Pompey the Little  To which may be added a chorus  Of larks linnets and finches  Your ladyship would very justly accuse me of ingratitude were I to neglect my outofdoor connections whether footed or featheredat the end of my garden you observe a beehive inhabited by small but industrious people and though their little city swarms again I do not think there is a single drone amongst themand this is no very usual circumstance attending a populous place there is not however what can be called a lazy creature in the whole  commonwealth for the crowned head labours with his subjects and every individual collects something in to the general treasuryA still minuter community possess the empire of that sunny hillock and are likewise animals of so commercial a turn that the buz of eternal business resounds through the neighbourhoodYour ladyship will likewise take notice of some familyhens and fir Chanticlear at the head of them strutting and gallanting it in all the pride of passion and of conquestit is the custom of the country to allow him many wives madam and therefore I do not interfere in his amours on this charter he enjoys the privilege and vanity of his feathered seraglio as uncontrouled as a sultan and for the same reason as  I said beforefor were it otherwise by the chastity of the moon I swear madam that I would wring off the wretch's neck for the horrid crimes of polygamy and incontinencenotwithstanding the creature might plead the force of custom and hope to find an excuse in the illustrious examples of the human race  A few anecdotes relating to one thing more I must recommend to your ladyship I mean  MY ROBINREDBREAST  Him however I claim not as private property but rather as my friend  he hath been my occasional howdoye visitor for many yearsthe bloom of his bosom is a little faded you see madamAt our first acquaintance he was somewhat shybut he is at length so infinitely domesticated that he eats from my hands drinks out of the same fountain with my linnets and in cold weather is seldom out of my cottagemy animals are all upon very good terms with him The finches and he sing to each other and the very cats through habit and disciplinesuch is the force of a happy education spare his lifethough to say the truth this does sometimes go desperately against the grainfor now and then as he hops upon the floor hunting the food that hath escaped the eyes of the familythey  look wistfully at him and are ready as it were to seize him as natural prey  I would not however insinuate to the discredit of my poor Bob that by leaving the house in the warm seasons he acts the ingrate and forgets the hand that protected him in the hour of cold and hungerno madam He has not mixed enough with the vicious part of the world to adopt a baseness which is almost peculiar to the human species So far otherwise that I am certain the little thing would share with me the last crumb nay in a case of extremity he would resign the whole meal though it had been the labour of the day to hunt it in the hedges In the summer Bob will indeed make excursionsjust to  stretch his wings and visit a few redbreasted neighboursbut he ever and anon flies back to his favourite spotpecks at my window as much as to sayhow go you on sirand then sits whistling under the currantbush I have also the pleasure of a nightingale's acquaintance but as some misfortune presses on the poor thing she seldom comes nearer my cottage than yonder thicket where embowered among the bushes she fixes her residence upon a solitary branch beneath the umbrage of an elm yet having a sweet pipe she sings me a song at a small distance that only serves to send it more meliorated to the ear almost every evening Her note indeed is always in the penserosobut there is melody in  her sorrow and every variation in the harmonious melancholy works its way into the heart I have frequently stood listening to her pathetic warblings till the tears have started to my eyeand thus I totally gave myself up to the tenderness of sympathy It was in one of these periods just as the last beams of light were reddening in the hemisphere that standing in my garden I heard the voice of Philomela jurgle from the copse There was a more than usual plaintiveness in her song and as I profess to understand precisely the language of birds I could not but attend particularly to my feathered friendI sat myself down in that little bower the aukward architecture of a pastoral hour and soon perceived  that my musical neighbour had chosen that evening to recapitulate the history of her misfortunes As soon as she ceasedwhich happened indeed before she had concluded the story owing I presume by the abruptness of her breaking off to the inquisitive impertinence of some chattering bird which invaded her sanctuaryperhaps to teaze her with the irksome chirup of condolence I retired into my cottage and put together as well as I was able a translation of those touching sentiments I had heard As often as I am inclined to be serious and pensive pleasures are particularly dear to me I turn over the narrative of my poor nightingale and draw from her misfortunes the most exquisite reflections Without supposing  your ladyship remarkably anxious to search into secrets I must naturally have excited your curiosity to see the story You shall not be disappointed You will instantly read the  ELEGY of a NIGHTINGALE  I  For Elusino lostrenew the strain  Pour the sad note upon the ev'ning gale  And as the length'ning shades usurp the plain  The silent moon shall listen to the tale  II  Sore was the timeill fated was the hour  The thicket shook with many an omen dire  When from the topmost twig of yonder bower  I saw my husbandtremble and expire  III  'Twas when the peasant sought his twilight rest  Beneath the brow of yonder breezy hill  'Twas when the plumy nation sought the nest  And all but such as lov'd the night were still  IV  Thatas I sat with all a lover's pride  As was my custom when the sun withdrew  Dear Elusino sudden left my side  And the curs'd form of man appear'd in view  V  For sport the tube he levell'd at our head  And curious to behold more near my race  Low in the copse the artful robber laid  Explor'd our haunt and thunder'd at the place  VI  Ingrateful wretchhe was our shepherd's son  The harmless good old tenant of yon cot  That shepherd would not such a deed have done  'Twas love to him that fix'd us to this spot  VII  Oft' as at eve his homeward steps he bent  When the laborious task of day was o'er  Our mellowed warbling footh'd him as he went  'Till the charm'd hindforgot that he was poor  VIII  Ahcould not this thy gratitude inspire  Could not our gentle visitations please  Could not the blameless lessons of thy sire  Restrain thy barb'rous hand from crimes like these  IX  Oh cruel boythou tyrant of the plain  Couldst thou but see the sorrows thou hast made  Or didst thou know the virtues thou hast slain  And view the gloomy horrors of the shade  X  Couldst thou behold my infant younglings lay  In the moss cradle which our bills prepar'd  Babes as they werethe offspring of the day  Their wings defenceless and their bosoms bar'd  XI  Surely the mighty malice of thy kind Thy pow'r to wrong and readiness to kill  In common pity to the parent's mind Would cease the newmade father's blood to spill  XII  Haplythe time may come when heav'n may give  To thee the troubles thou hast heap'd on me  Haplyere well thy babes begin to live  Death shall present the dart of misery  XIII  Just as the tender hope begins to rise  As the fond mother hugs her darling boy  As the big rapture trembles in the eyes  And the breast throbs with all a parent's joy  XIV  Then may some midnight robber skill'd in guile  Resolv'd on plunder and on deeds of death  Thy fairy prospectstender transports spoil  And to the kniferesign thy children's breath  XV  In that sad moment shall thy savage heart  Feel the keen anguish desperate and wild  Conscience forlorn shall doubly point the smart  And justice whisperthis is child for child  XVI  Rest of their siremy babes alas must sigh  For grief obstructs the widow's anxious care  This wasted formthis everweeping eye  And the deep note of destitute despair  XVII  All load this bosom with a fraught so sore  Scarce can I cater for the daily food  Where'er I search my husband search'd before  And soonmy nest will holdan orphan brood  XVIII  For Eleusino lost then pour the strain  Waft the sad note on ev'ry ev'ning gale  And as the length'ning shades  The interruption madam put an end to her complaintperhaps your good sense may here express some surprize that as birds have one language to shew their misery and another to mark their happiness Philomela should whistle out her calamity If this should not be thought quite in nature I beg she may find an apology in the Italian and English  OPERA  The definition of this composition isa miscellany of the most monstrous contradictions not  in  but  out  of human natureit is part ballad and part dialoguehalf poetry and half prosepart tragedy and part comedybut all together it is in every sense of the word a complete farce As they are all manufactured upon the same principle a specimen of one will serve as a specimen of every thing that hath been produced in this way The curtain draws and discovers two young people the one a lady in love  the other her friend and considante the lady tells her companion she doats upon a pretty fellow this is first talked over in prose and then set to music in poetry upon this the pretty fellow enterstells you his history and then gives you his most serious reflections thereupon in a tune the young lady and he meet with many disappointmentsthese make them very serious upon which they sing desperately one against anotherdiscover all along their passion and their despairquaver out their feelings to exact time and after an infinite deal of musical labour make their exits in an air that closes in the clapping of hands The fathers and relations next advance and bluster out their objections to the match agreeable to  the notes of the fiddlesong combats with sentimentnonsense jostles probability and the whole concludes with the universal applause of a British Audience Such madam is the skeleton of a modern burlettapray pardon Philomela for adopting the passion of so refined a nationwe will now return madam to  THE COTTAGE  In which amidst my agreeable and innocent society I sit as the Lord Protector and it were indeed shameful if I did nothing myselfI do a great dealas much indeed as one pair of hands can well master for your ladyship  must know that nothing which bears a greater resemblance to the human face than nature hath thought proper to bestow upon my owls do I ever suffer to come near me My reasons for this oddity are not unworthy your notice and shall be briefly communicated presently  It is now more than time I should explain myself as to another oddity It must have surprised you not a little to receive a public address from a perfect strangera stranger to every thing but your character and an idea even of that was obtained from the lips of very poor people whom your judicious benevolence hath made happy with a little  Be it known to your ladyship that my sentiments upon behaviour are not less peculiar than my method of living Many now would have prefaced dedicationized and introductionized these volumes with all possible parade of apology I have at this moment in idea the very language a modern author would use on this subject As it ever appeared to me one of the most unnatural crimes in the world to bury a thought which is but just created and begottenand by such means smother the intellectual embrio in the womb of the brainI beg you will allow me to deliver myself of that with which I now labour The only midwife which we writers call in upon these occasions is simply the feather of a goose and I am concerned  for the dignity of my fraternity to inform your ladyship that after all the pains of the birth and trouble of dressing the brat very ofteneven at full growthwants the sense of a gander  DEDICATION  To the Right Hon worthy and beautiful The Lady * Viscountess of * Lady of the * And one of her Majesty's ** **  MADAM  I must humbly beg permission to throw this trifle at your ladyship's feet and deeply conscious as I am of its  unworthinessof its inaccuracy and of its incapacity to stand before so bright and penetrating an eye as your ladyship'sI should not presume even to hope pardon for my temerity were I not consoled by reflecting that your taste infinite as it is meets a powerful competitor in the immensity of your goodnature But I have long wished an opportunity to approach so sacred and distinguished a character and I now come forwards on my knee with the profoundest humility of those creatures which form a part of my present subject As your illustrious birth defies the ambition of mere human words on the one hand so your unparalleled virtues annihilate the force of terrestrial compliments on the other I shall therefore on those heads  observe a religious silence Yet so far I must implore liberty of doing violence to your delicacy as to remark that you are at once the pattern and paragon of the agethat your beauty wit graces and taste are the envy of one sex as your judgment and genius are the astonishment and motives of despair in the other People of fashion in other ages have undoubtedly possessed some admirable qualities One woman may perhaps have been almost as handsome a second may have been almost as agreeable a third may have possibly possessed equal sensibility and a fourth may have been nearly as liberal But the grand consolidation and concentrationthe universal assemblage of bewitching accomplishments each collected  together ray by ray and blazing to a point like a July sun were reserved for that curiosity of providence the amiable lady * * * *  I humbly implore forgiveness for this intrusion which I will only lengthen by beseeching your graceI mean your ladyshipthough a duchess you ought to bewill permit me to assure you  How sincerely I am And Eternally will be Your ladyship's Most obliged Most obedient Obsequious Devoted slave And very zealous servant *** ***  Your ladyship will observe that the above address will equally suit all ages characters sexes and conditions The secret of writing dedicationsor in other wordsof drawing characters is simply this Produce a pamphlet which is frequently written on purpose to introduce the dedication as soon as it is finished cast about for a person of rank whom you never saw and taking a quire of gilt paper transcribe the performance therein and send it in manuscript to the patron whom it is proper to compliment with all the virtues that ever entered into the heart of man Now in this transaction it is not necessary that the party complimented should actually possess any of the said virtues nor is that a matter of scrupulous enquiry  with the author It is sufficient for him that he can obtain a purse of money in return for a page of compliment and a skilful writer will always proportion his quantity of praise to the quantity of cash which he expects So much flattery for so much profit There are dedications of all prices from five guineas to five hundren though I could afford the above for fifty and yet I believe it contains as pretty flights as roundabout metaphors as bombastic circumlocution as was ever sent from a little man in obscurity to a great man in the gay worldI should have said woman but as I observed before it will do as well for one sex as the other Many are the noblemen and noblewomen who would be highly pleased  with this prostration of soul and sentiment but I will not insult your ladyship's understanding with such dishonest nonsense There is a sensation in the good mind which beggars the loftiest flight of poetical adulation I am superior to the arts of a

the tenderest hearts BENIGNUS at a very early period began to search for a friend from the age of fifteen to the age of thirtytwo were his labours unwearied and unrewarded At length having wasted his fortune and spirits he gave up the endeavour in despair and retiring to a forest on the banks of thehe spent the latter days of his life in animal society No human being was invited to his hut  no human form was sollicited to approach it In view of the smoke of the metropolis he lived as an hermit and resolved never more to see the face of man It happened however that in the year he fell sick and having laid till his distemper had got beyond the reach of medicine and till his collection of creatures were wasted to the bone he crawled by painful efforts from his bed to the door of his cottage and fastening thereto a written label with these words  THE PROPERTY OF THE FIRST TRAVELLER  he staggered back again to his couch I was at this crisis madam upon my return to town from a rural excursion and as I always loved to explore the most  unfrequented paths in order to diversify the prospects of my journey I beheld through the obstructions of a great number of trees something like the abode of a fellowcreature I hung my horse at the next hedge and resolved to satisfy my desire to know  what  man had chosen so pastoral a situation in an age when the ideas of Arcadia are treated as the fables of the brain It was with some toil I tore my way through the bushes for footing saw I noneat length I arrived at the structure and read the sentiment on the label Fear now operated as strongly as curiosityI knew not whether to go forward or to retreat It might possibly be the refuge of a robber and the inscription on the door might be a trap for the incautious  wanderer I gave way however to my favourite inclination and pulled the latch that admitted me into the cottage  The furniture of the apartment struck me dumb with astonishment for the groans of the dying and the situations of the dead resembled rather a charnelhouse than the cottage of simplicitybirds of various sort were laying dead in their cagesdogs and squirrels were writhing in the last agonythe master of the mansion was just expired and one poor solitary cat empress of the dominion seemed to eye the dead as her natural property  In a christian countrynay in a forest so near to I was doubly amazed at these shocking circumstanceswhat  measure to pursue I knew not Upon casting my eyes round the room I saw a small trunk and at the end of that several small sacks Upon looking into the box I found it full of manuscripts which immediately commanded my attention and upon examination of papers I soon found the secret of this extraordinary person's birth and connexions I sought out his relations by the clue his letters and memorandums had given me they were people of rank and as he absconded from every body suddenly they judged him to have been either drowned or murdered However the dead body was restored to the family and now sleeps with its ancestors in * * * *  To this very enterprize however I am indebted for something that I value madam beyond every other worldly possession I found it wrapt curiously up in a small bag of crimson velvet in a little private drawer at the bottom of the trunk which contained the manuscripts and it was afterwards given to me as a rewarding present by the relations of Benignus for the discovery It accounts for every peculiarity in the conduct of the unhappy man in whose cottage it was found and although it cannot defend his total desertion of society in the opinion of the world yet it hath so endeared his memory to me that I have in some measure followed his example and adopted many of his sentiments ever since  But as it would be unpardonable for me to lead you into the gloom without endeavouring to reward you for it I will now unlock my darling treasure and transcribe from the original manuscript a few anecdotes from  THE LEGEND OF BENIGNUS  PREFACE  As some explanations may be thought necessary for leaving the world after having mixed in it for a number of yearsand for not transmitting any account of myself since the first hour of my sequestration I  will now throw together the principal heads of my history and shall leave it behind me as an apology for my conductif haply either I or this shed which I have erected with my own hands shall at any future time be discovered But as I shall write down these matters at my hours of leisure when they interfere not with the duties of my domestic family I shall divide the adventures into separate chapters that I may take up or lay down the pen as I think proper  CHAP I  The history of my very babyhood is peculiarI was certainly born to be  the sport of fortuneThe day which gave me to the world took my mother out of it and a month afterwards my father caught a fever sickened and followed her Thus was I an orphan in the nurseryI soon discovered a love of societyMy guardian who was a clergyman provided me with books and little companions and put out my fortune which consisted of twelve thousand pounds in specie at interest The books which he put into my hands were the SpectatorsThey first put me upon speculation and my young friends led me into relaxations of amusement I had not the general objections of a boy to school because I was eager after every sort of knowledge I took my instructions in proportion to my  applicationbut in all my readings and researches the attachment to my fellowcreatures was my first and favourite passion Benevolence was the leading principle of my life I considered myself as born to the great duty of making every body happy around me A virtuous sentiment warmed my heart a tender story wetted my eyemy hand was open to distress in every form and I was always ready to give the allowance of my childhood to the alleviation of misery the Spectators which were all the private library I had at this timewith Virgil Homer Sallust and other of my school books were all full of expressions which encouraged me in my generous principle they one and all declared that  To be good was to be happy  CHAP II  Upon this noble principle I resolved to begincontinueand end my exstienceI wrote concerning my resolution to my guardianhe confirmed and established the maxim and concluded by assuring me that the only way  To be happy was to be good  There are few situations in life more pleasing than the contemplations of a young mind upon the subject of universal happiness The theory of these ideas is delightfulthe practice is sometimes a little mortifying  especially to young people I began to put in force my system immediately I entered into the common pleasure of a schoolboy and tried every possible method to endear myself to my companions Whenever they committed a childish fault I took the blame upon myselfwhenever any disputes arose I endeavoured to compromise the matter to the general tranquillity and whenever they broke any of their toys I privately repaired the loss with new ones But some how or another these efforts did not turn out quite satisfactorily I got several severe whippings for fathering errors which were not my own I was stigmatised by the lads as a busy body for interfering with quarrels which did not concern me  and I was accused of partiality for making presents to one playmate in preference to another And thus my benevolence was in the very first outset rewarded with severity and contempt However I was too well grounded in the truth of my grand principle and had indeed naturally too tender an heart to suffer a few slight mortifications to relax the vigour of my virtue The morning of life is the meridian of generosity and though I was a little miserable at my disappointment I made myself certain that if I continued  To be good I should certainly be happy  CHAP III  A number of the boys had one day formed a party to rob the orchard of a neighbouring farmer and from the orchard had predetermined to march to the henroost and then return with their spoils to their several chambers Intelligence of this was communicated to me by a boy who was piqued at being unengaged in the adventure The shock I felt at the news is indiscribable The next evening was to be the time fixt for the perpetration of the fact It was altogether a business so repugnant to all the precepts I had read and so immediately combated my notions of  benevolence that I trembled at the ideaI turned over the Spectators every paper was flat against it I knew not what to do The most anxious state of the mind is the agitation of divided and irresolute reflections I was bewildered betwixt two measures unknowing which to choose or which to reject The questions to be debated were these Shall I prevent this bad action by expostulating with the boys or by acquainting the master of the design to commit it the tenderness of my heart represented a general flaggellation as the reward of the latter and I therefore chose the former When once a scheme of this kind is formed by a set of boys there is a sort of inflexible attachment among the conspirators  that has all the solemnity of a plot upon the government every lip is sealed and every eye is waryI found the banditti a part from the rest of of the boys gathered together in the true circle of consultationhead within head and arm within armI introduced the subject so as to soften its atrociousness Endeavoured as a frienda schoolfellow and a companionto dissuade them from so dishonest an attempt argued with them as from playmate to playmate and conjured them to desistpromising at the same time to purchase the  very  objects of their present machinations out of my own pocketthey heard me out without any other interruption than stifled titteringswinks nods and knocks against the elbows  of each otherbut at the conclusion the general pleasantry was no longer to be disguised and they burst out into a downright laugh As soon as they had satisfied their appetite of derision they assumed a more serious air called me a listner a poor cowardly brat without spirit for glorious enterprizebid me stick to my books and at last set up a great shout and fairly hissed me from their society  CHAP IV  I retired to my chamber and burst into tears a train of reflections pressed hard upon my heart and in spite of all my belief in the rectitude of my favourite maxim I could not help arguing with myselfWhat  said I is it necessary that in the effort to do good to others I must make myself miserable Well well no matter these little miscarriages are but so many trials of my integrity As the gold comes purified from the fire so no doubt shall my happiness come augmented from trifling anxieties magnanimously sustained I will go on in the strait road and not faulter at the thorns briars or impediments which I meet in the journey even though their points and prickles draw blood from my heart  To be good is to be happy  The dusk of evening began at length to fall upon the earth under cover of which the young robbers were to sally forthI could no longer smother up  the secret in my breast The anxiety of suppression had already halfdistracted me I saw my master reading in the garden and immediately ran to him An act of real fraud must be done or prevented within half an hour I loved my playmates but I loved my principles yet moreafter many hesitations and begging their only punishment might be a falutary lecture of reproof I unsolded the whole scheme The master looked extremely solemn while I was speaking but how was I amazed at the conclusion to see half a smile prevail over the habitual wrinkles of his forehead He bid me "not be so much concernedthat boys would be boysthat robbing orchards and henroosts were a sort of pettylarceny which the little pilferers  would commit in defiance of the rod and that though he should not encourage theft yet that such small depredations upon apples and poultry were always among the adventures of every lad of spirit and that it would not be political in a master to whip them violently away lest it should hurt their future courage to combat the adversities of lifeobserving in the close of his harangue that in general those children made the best men which were foremost in such puerile archievements" I bowed and withdrew Fresh thinking brought on fresh perplexityI fell again to soliloquy He that steals a chicken said I at ten years old may be tempted to take a purse at twenty I rambled very far in the labyrinth of reflectionI could make nothing  of itI gave up the point with the following remarkThe master and the boys are both wrongI have done  my  duty and my conscience is discharged of a very great loadWithout dispute  To be good is to be happy  The next morningfor my master did not think fit to flog for an intended errorbut suffered the fact to be first committedthe next morning a charge was produced against the offenders and I was pointed out as their accuser In this however the master was disingenuous for my evidence was utterly unnecessary the proofs being found on the very persons of the parties as their waistcoats and coats and stockings were  covered with the down and the feathers of their trophies and the pockets of every delinquent like the panniers of a fruiterer stuck preposterously out from each side and betrayed the prog and vegetable spoils within However I stood forth being called upon in defence of my veracity The culprits were by no means hardened in the habit of error and the deep blush of every cheek betrayed silent confessionThe bill was found against them and the sentence of whipping was executed on the spotThe cry was piercing and went to my hearthow readily would I have partaken the anguishAs soon as this exercise was over my master went out of the schoolbefore his back was well turned the very  objects of his discipline began to mimic and make faces at him and as soon as they judged him to be out of hearing the whole school was up in arms against me who they aspersed as a little paltry puppy which ought to be knocked on the head for telling tales out of school News was now brought in that as the master was seized with an headach and could not attend school the chief boy must go through the business of the morning in his stead The boys took advantage of this hour of security and instantly revenged the discipline they had received for my information tenfold upon me They buffeted me with their hats spurted ink upon my cloaths spit in my face kicked me in the breech and loaded me with every  insult that a set of barbarous brats could possibly inflict upon the cat which they had tied to the stake In conclusionnot a boy would sit near meI was avoided as a pestilence and some of the smartest actually made verses on my TREASON as they called it and sung them about the yard to ludicrous tunesMy sensations at these insults were a mixture of ten thousand feelings at the same moment  For a long time after this transaction I scarce exchanged ten words with any one but wandered up and down the yard in a sad solitary manner like a distempered sheep discarded and beaten from the flock Sometimes indeed an arch wag would tell me a sorrowful history of his lossesthe  breaking of a hoop or the demolition of a top but as soon as he had obtained his end he would sidle off to his old companions and putting out his tongue tell how cleverly he had taken in the INFORMER  Thus was I cussed mocked hooted at and deserted for endeavouring to prevent an action which I thought on all hands unlawful and unbenevolent I again took up my dear Spectators and in those inestimable volumes I found that the only way to felicity was to PERSEVERE in well doingThis sentiment was like a cordial to a fainting manI shut the book walked chearfully across my chamber and resolving to persevere concluded as usual that  To be good was to be happy  CHAP V  At the end of about two months the severity of my fate began to remit of its rigour Perpetuated malignity is not often the vice of a schoolboy As I was altogether of a social turn I even went so far as to purchase a reconciliation at the price of a few concessions But the greatest progress towards a reunion betwixt me and the boys was made by a skilful distribution of presents and promisesfor however strange it may seem the influence of money is not greater in the state than in the schools A penny judiciously bestowed will secure the heart of a child as firm as a bank note can possibly  secure the voice and interest of a man Children learn very early to be venal and though few are misers a very great number are mercenary I was at length pretty well reestablished in their graces and really began to think they repented of their treatment to me This idea so softened my heart that I actually invoked the Muse upon the occasion and yielding to the friendly impulse composed a Poem in praise of youthful affection This was read in open senate and the sentiments highly approved I now thought myself blest for I supposed I had persuaded my schoolfellows to  Be good  And therefore I  Was happy  A friend of our master and a father to one of the boys obtained us an holidaythe school was emptied in a moment and its inhabitants dispersed into several parties agreeable to their respective passions and pursuits It was however soon resolved nem con to make it a day of birdnesting The idea of game once started by an experienced boy like a pack of hounds the whole follow his trail they were civil enough to invite my companythat I might not offend them by refusal I agreed to accompany them though I detested the diversionwe immediately betook ourselves to the fields and inclosures which resounded with the notes of passion the calls of courtship and the song of satisfaction The  boys inspected narrowly into every hedge and tore their fingers and hands in the scrutiny It was the middle of the summer when animal nature teems almost universally with life Every bush therefore inspired expectation They soon found eggs in abundance Some formed them into a string of beadsothers smashed them against the ground to see the embrios within thus prematurely hatched and murdered in the shock while some at all events broke them at one end and sucked out the contentsas yet however no young were found and being wearied with search they suspended it awhile and agreed to lie down and rest under a large cluster of maples which afforded an agreeable shade at a small distance  Thither they repaired and as they appeared to be in a less noisy disposition than usual I thought proper to take advantage of the moment and endeavour to impress them with a sense of my own PRINCIPLEthe retreat was so comfortable that few of them were willing to forsake it at least till the sun abated his fervor as he descended to the west To sill up the interval I proposed to tell them a story A story is a very acceptable matter to the extreme curiosity of a young mind and my offer was immediately caught at A general silence prevailed through the little incumbent audience and I addressed it in the following manner  CHAP VI  IN TIMES OF OLD there lived a man near a great forest He was a keeper of sheep and had as the story goes a very large familySome of his children were grown up and some were infants One was in the cradle and two were upon the lap The mother was a noted spinner and she set all the girls to work as soon as they could hold the wool in their hands and had streagth enough to turn round the wheel while the father took care to find outofdoor business for the boyssome were herdboys and some that were too weak for hard work scared the birds from cornnow it is reported by the neighbours  of the adjacent village that the old shepherd was a mighty odd character and that he bred up his family in a very different manner from the maxims of his poor neighbours As he was unable to give them the advantage of an education like ours and teach them Latin and Greek he was resolved to educate them in such accomplishments as his situation permitted He was a man of tenderness and simplicity and often said to his children"Do all the good you can boys but be sure you do no harm You must all labour for a livelihood but you may always get your bread innocently and the bread that is honestly earned will be always sweet I am myself obliged to attend a flock your mother is compelled to spin  to the poor sheep therefore we are all indebted they furnish us with food and raiment I therefore love the harmless creatures and would not hurt them for all that they are worth let this teach you to behave properly to poor dumb animals and to use them as they deserve and may thy father's  curse  overtake thee if at any time ye do wrong to those which do no wrong to thee for be assured  wanton cruelty will always be returned upon the tormentor  The whole family listened to the old man's argument and it would have been well for them if they had always obeyed the precepts of their father But now comes the cream of the storypray therefore attend The eldest son had one day taken the nest of a robin which consisted of five  young ones and a sixth just bursting from the shellhe carried them home to his brothers and sisters to each of which he gave a bird but the little nestling he gave to one of the children in the lap who wrapping it up in a piece of flannel put it into a small wicker basket and set it to the fire The boy that found the nest tied a string to the leg of his bird and cruelly dragged it after himthe second son run pins through the eyes of his bird and took a delight in seeing it bleed to deathThe third gave his to the cat or rather  pretended  to give it for he held it first pretty close to puss's whiskers and then pulled it away from her but at last she pounced upon it and carried off one of the legsThe eldest daughter intended  to have taken care of her's but one of her brothers having murdered his own seized upon her property and both pulling the poor wretch different ways betwixt compassion and cruelty it died in the contestand the younger girl now in possession of the only bird that was left put her's into a cage and covered it over with wool At this crisis the mother who had been gleaning and the old shepherd returned home The limbs of the dead birds were seen upon the floor and the cat was busily employed in a corner at clearing them away The old man insisted upon the truth The trembling boy confessed itBarbarous wretches cried the shepherdis this the return for my care and instructionbut I will punish ye for itthe eldest son he tied by the leg and did to him as he  did to the birdthe second son he scratched with pins till his hands were all over bloodat the third he set his dog who caught him by the leg as he was used to catch the sheepthe eldest daughter who had lost her bird he pitiedhe kiss'd the second daughter which had put her poor thing into the cage but he  hugged to his very heart  the little creature that had placed the nestling in a warm basketNow IT PLEASED GOD that about six or seven months after this the eldest son which had been the cause of all this mischief fell sick and died and many people are now living who say that as he was going to be put into the ground the ravens rooks kites and other vast birds all flew over his coffin screamed and could by no  means be got away nor could he rest in his grave for them because the animals were always digging up the earth under which he lay as if they were resolved to eat him upand some declare  he is actually gone  I beg pardon schoolfellows for this long story but I shall finish directly I cannot help mentioning to you the different fate of the good little girl that treated the poor animal tenderly A year after the death of her brother she died herself of the small pox and I do assure you it has been told to me for fact that her grave is a perfect garden for the robins do not suffer a single weed to grow upon it and GOD ALMIGHTY has adorned it with wild fieldflowers as innocent as the baby which they cover  CHAP VII  Though this story was universally attended to with great earnestness yet it failed upon the whole of producing the effect desired Some few indeed were attracted by its moral but the far greater number were satisfied with saying it was a  pretty story  only that they disliked the conduct of the father whom they censured as a cruel old fellow which deserved to be hanged They now got up and renewed their sport with a vigour which my poor story seemed to have redoubledNay some of them carried the matter so far as to wish they could hit upon a robin's  nest that they might try what sun could possibly lie in the experiments related in the narrativePerceiving this I began to repersuadethey laughedI protested that I would go without pleasure for ever rather than derive it from the pain of innocence They jested on my gravity even to clamourI conjured them to listen to the general notes of loss and lamentation which echoed from the parents whose young they were seeking to destroyThey vowed that they wished they had all the birds of the air in a netand as to me whom they called a squeamish milksop if I did not like the amusement I might go home and play at patball with my sisteraddingfor their part they intended each of them to bring home  a  hatfull of creatures  then return and dispose of their spoil as they thought proper  CHAP VIII  Once more mortified and disappointed in my benevolent endeavours I sought the road that led to the school and in walking along I could not but indulge some mysterious ruminations  Surely said I there is something very strange in all this My efforts to  Be good  seem to counteract my efforts to be Happy  At the time my good nurse told me the story which I told to the boys I remember it made me both weep and tremble and I believe I never killed or injured a fly in my whole lifenay I feel for the very brute that suffers to support me and sometimes shed a tear to the  necessity  that condemns it to destructionMy schoolfellows on the contrary delight in slaughter death and massacre I have seen them exert upon a bird a bat a wasp or a worm more tortures than I thought any thing that had life could support I tell them it is crueland they treat me with derisionnay several  grown up people  join the laugh against me and say that I was designed for a girl  I must write to my guardian on the subjectcertainly  To be good must be to be happy  And yet how is it that though I do all the little good in my power I am still miserableHow is it that on those days in which I only do no harm I am less insulted than on those in which I labour to do good Yet in one case my merit is negativein the other actually agreeable to all that I have read in the Scriptures and Spectators and all that I have heard from the lips of my guardian What a number of indignities have I already suffered for the very things from which I expected happiness'Tis very distressing  and I am determined to know the the cause of it  By this time I had got into a green lane pretty near the house of my master and turning my head aside to see what occasioned a flouncing I heard close by me I saw a creature hanging by the horns at the edge of the ditchit was a sheep either thrown there by some boys or caught amongst the briars by chance the poor creature was half smothered in the mudat the price of a great deal of toil and dirt I disentangled the animal but it was so weary with former efforts that I had still to drag it from the ditchI did so and when it came out it was difficult to tell which was the more shocking spectacle for it was one of  those ditches that on account of its gloomy and humid situation even the warmth of the summer could not dry up  I sat by the creature till it recovered strength to stagger away and I must own had no small inclination to carry it with my own hands into the next grass enclosure but I desisted from this because I thought I might trespass on the property of some one to whom the sheep did not belong though I was now scarce fifteen reading thinking and observation had taught me such habits of sentiment  At this crisis a man on horseback passed me and seeing the sheep in such a condition and me in as bad  suspected that I had been its tormentorhe said that I deserved to have the skin whipped over my earsso I should think so too said I if I had been guilty of so barbarous an action come come don't tell a lie into the bargain you young rascal that's worse than the other said the man and spreading the thong of his whip hit me a violent blow in the face that set my nose a bleeding and rode onand yet while I was a talking with this merciful man I happened to cast my eye under the girth of his saddle and found almost every vein in the horse from one flank to the other gushing with bloodhis spurs and the heel of his boot were clogged  Notwithstanding this treatment I felt some pleasure in the rich reflection of having rescued a dumb animal from miserybut my nose spouted so obstinately that I was obliged to make the best of my way to the school especially as I had been detained rather late by my adventure The birdnesters had returned before me and they with the rest of the scholars were in the sittingroom with the master at supper  I did not till I entered the apartment reflect that my figure was at present likely to excite both ridicule and enquirybut the moment I opened the door the whole society were in an uproarmy face was covered with goremy nose swelled with the lash of the horseman's  whip and my clothes were of the same hue with the poor sheep's back the master was so exasperated at the sight that he would not hear a word about the story but caned me severely for spoiling my things made me a public example before the very boys whom I had been advising to be tenderheartedpushed me from his presence and sent me supperless to bed  My private meditations were not pleasantI had no light to look into my Spectators nor do I suppose I should have derived at that time any relief from them had it been funshineI had no inclination for sleep and yet got into bed the birdnesters came into my chamber before they retired for the night into  their own and with an air of exultation told me  they  had rare sport but supposed  I  had still bettercalled me raw head and bloodybones and bade me good night  After lying silent above three hours  Good God cried I for what have I been thus chastisedfretted and insultedIs it for my benevolence If  To be good is to be happy  wherefore are all my best designs thus frustratedThe first rays of the morning light broke in upon my reflectionsI arose and taking out ink and paper sat myself down at the window to write  CHAP IX  I threw together an explicit account of my various sufferings actions and apprehensions and sent them away to my guardian as soon as I was allowed the privilege of walking again amongst my playmates The clergyman to whom my father thought proper to leave the direction of his affairs was as honest and inoffensive a priest as ever harangued from a pulpit He was esteemed by his parishioners profoundly learned insomuch that scarce any business was done in the village without his knowledge From his wisdom and friendship I expected great satisfaction and  anticipated the return of the post with all imaginable pleasure  Anticipation of pleasure however is the very destruction of it The returning post came and brought me a BLACK SEALmy guardian had died of an apoplexy an hour after the receipt of my letter which he was preparing to answer I was summoned suddenly away to take possession of his papers for the good man having no family nor any connexions which were dearer to him than the son of the friend of his youth had in the fondness of his heart made his last sentiments in my favor and indeed left me sole excutor The suddenness of the circumstance at first stunned meI put the letter of death into the hand of my masterbegged  he would suffer me to set out directly and flung myself into a chairthe tears came at last I loved the deceased beyond expressionwithout attending to what was said to meI got into a chaise and drove to * * * *  CHAP X  To young men of a serious complexion the chamber of death is inexpressibly terrible especially when the body of a benefactor is extended on the bedAt a proper time I trusted him to the bosom of the earth with every mark of decency and affection and at length I ventured to read over his will and take account of  his effectsmy youth and experience unsitting me for these affairs I called in the assistance of an attorney who resided at a market town three miles from the village who had indeed drawn up the testament for my guardian To the judgment of this gentleman who bore a fair reputation I trusted Till he came indeed the house might very properly be termed an house of mourning for a great concourse of sable looking people were crowding together into every room The whole village was actually emptied into the vicarage I found they came upon two distinct errands To  condole  and to  congratulate  They were vastly sorry their good pastor was gone but they were extremely glad that I was come and heartily  wished me many happy years I returned them thanks for the latter part of their business and wept with them for the first The lawyer appeared They fled Mourners of this kied detest an attorneyperhaps because he knows them better than a raw schoolboy My house was cleared in a moment It is not without very peculiar propriety I make use of the word  cleared  for I soon found that those very weepers and wailers were no other than some of  those  birds of prey that watch the mortality of an human body scent the carcase from afar and vulture like immediately proceed to plunder They cried indeed with their eyes but not chusing to hold up an handkerchief to wipe them their pickers and stealers  were at liberty to secrete certain portable moveables which perhaps they might take a particular fancy to Poor wretches they did not know that  To be good was to be happy  Upon inspection into matters it appeared that the good clergyman had died worth three thousand pounds besides his dwelling house which he built a large garden a small paddock adjoining his garden and a considerable quantity of furniture His living fell again into the hands of the patron The whole of the above he had given to me subjected to the payment of a small legacy of l to a very distant relation and twenty pounds to the  poor of the village to be distributed amongst the properest objects on the second Sunday after his deceaseBy the will of my own father it was requested that my guardian would nominate a second in case of his own death during my infancy This appointment my father neglected to do himself perhaps because he wished to pay a compliment to the good clergyman But being himself an hearty man he had not made over the trust and as he died suddenly the sole disposal both of the fortune left by my father and the fortune left by my guardian came naturally to my discretion I expressed a surprize at thisthe attorney said it was certainly an  oversight  in my guardian  we were both a good while silent The lawyer submitted it to me as an act of  prudence  whether I would choose myself to appoint a trustee till I came of age and there was I remember an egotism in his looks which seemed to ask me what I should think of  him  for that office I told him I would take a day to deliberate upon it and consult with him again  CHAP XI  Now of all the things upon earth I knew the least how to manage money and yet I was in possession of near twenty thousand pounds including the accumulated interest of the twelve  thousand left by my fathera thought came suddenly across me which determined me at oncethe power of a pleasant idea when the soul is gloomy operates like an unexpected sunbeam darting through an hemisphere of cloudsthe sky and the face the element and the whole machine of man are in those cases equally bright and delightful'twas so with me As I am now master of twenty thousand pounds said I I shall be able to make many of my  good  fellowcreatures  happy  I will neither return to school nor attend lethargic universities but instantly step into life and mixing with mankind indulge at once my curiosity and my benevolenceWithout more ado I wrote to the attorney that I intended to travel and should  therefore want my ready money left by my guardian and that the sum which was already invested in the funds might remain The lawyer did not seem to like the measure but for the first time in my life I ran the risque of disobliging another to gratify myself 'twas not perhaps strictly benevolent yet as it was the first petulance I ever indulged the idea of the error came softened upon my understanding happy had it been for me if instead or stepping into life and putting money in my purse I had sat quietly down in the chimneycorner and like the virtuoso in the comedy travelled only in my Books  Amongst the furniture of the house which now decended to me  was a small walnuttree bookcase at the opening of which my foolish heart bigotted to sentiment leapt for pleasure and it was a dearer treasure to my heart at  that time  than all the money I had in the world It contained the following books  Works of Jeremy Taylor  of Thomas Ã  Kempis  B Burnet's Pastoral Care  Practice of Piety  St Chrysostom  The Tragedy of Cato  Annotations on the Scriptures  Quarles's Emblems  Pilgrim's Progress  Passion of Christ  Sermons in Volumes selected  Prayers for Private Houses  Baxter on the Soul  And  Drelincourt on Death  To these were added a collection of discourses in manuscript which my poor old friend used  ex officio  with every passage of which his parishioners were made repeatedly acquainted I wanted extremely to read all the volumes in my possession and would have begun the task directly but for one of those interruptions which are immediately attendant upon people in prosperity  CHAP XII  I was now condemned to that sort of drudgery which custom and complaisance have imposed upon men just stepped into a fortuneThe gentry of the neighbourhood came upon the commerce of visitings and the poor of my parish and all the parishes adjacent were at my gate upon the subject of charity I have since found out that these were pickpockets of different kinds At that time however I thought of them very differentlythe rich I received with cordiality and the poor never went away emptyhanded and yet by some strange waywardness and perverseness of my starsmy illluckor whatever  else influenced the events of my life I had never the good fortune to satisfy either Benevolence was still the motive but felicity was not the effect My heart was one of those which might be supposed to reside in the breast of a stripling impressed in the nursery with a sense of that great social duty extending from earth to heaventhe duty which beginning with GOD descends to  man  and terminates in  brute  With a natural inclination to gentleness I soon acquired from the Bible and Spectators an habit of  thinking  as well as  feeling  right Never indulging myself in those boyish feats which sow in children the first fatal seeds of cruelty injustice and ingratitude I in some sort acquired a degree of primitive purity  in my ideas that carried me into that line of action which I then thought the road to happiness but which I now perceive the certain path to indignity and disgrace With such a heart and with such propensities and principles belonging to it I loved allthought well of all embraced all With the sad I sympathizedwith the happy I exulted and to such as had none to help them but he who bids the primrose spring modestly round my present retreat I gave the comforts which even the economy of nature demanded Perhaps no man was ever accoutered with weapons of worse defence to struggle through the warfare of life than the principles and propensions I have mentioned  After all the fretful labours of an active though short existence I am now writing the heads of my history in the depth of an unfrequented forest From man I have nothing to expect since I have abjured his societyI am provided with water from the spring and I have taken care to supply myself with stores which were brought to the skirts of the wood by a mule whom I have now turned adrift to him that should find himI eat but littlemuch still remains in my storeboxthe tugs of heart and strokes of anguish that I met in society assure me that I shall not long continue in solitude alive I have ascended the hill and though I am yet but in the middle of man's life I feel myself at the very verge of the declivity The  ravages of misery are even greater than those of time There is nothing in my fight but a few dumb domestics which I have summoned together as the substitute of man and which soothe me when the broken heart requires consolation nor do I hear any thing in my forest but the innocent language and animated variety of such creatures as are formed to inhabit the wood The moment of fate which must carry me from earth cannot be long delayedI am writing these passages of my life under the immediate eye of a GOD whom I expect shortly to seeI expect therefore at the same time that whenever my history is read if it be ever found that the startling sentiments in this chapter may  be very particularly attended tonot condemned as the hasty effusions of a splenitic refugee who disappointed in his expectations prefers the society of beast to man but as a mournful  fact  the force of which will be always felt in proportion to the experience of the readerIf however my sentiments should as yet appear irreconcileable as I confess they clash with most of the common systems of the age let the objector  read on  and he will find them exemplified in the future periods of a narrative written by a a dying man  CHAP XIII  The last chapter contains the assertion which I pronounced would startle a great many people notwithstanding what has been advanc'd to corroborate it in the former part of this manuscriptI have ventured to assert that an extreme tender and good mind  ardently  pursuing its propensities is the most improper mind in the world to produce TERRESTRIAL felicity Objectible as this may seem I must take upon me in the full enjoyment of a sound mind and perfect memory to push the point farther and add that in  nine  instances  out of  ten  those propensities are utterly against him in  this  world and often bring their master to  discredit poverty  and  shame  The world will be up in arms against me and my bones will be hunted for and gibbettedWhat  Is notto be goodto be happy  The answer is given in a sentence In this world  generally  speaking No  Nor in the world to come  Yes  Are not men therefore  To be good  Yes  Wherefore  For the sake of God and our conscience  But is goodness then against our worldly interest  Nine times out of ten  Is not that the fault of God  No  Whose then  Man's  Impossible  Suffer me to prove it  READ ON  CHAP XIV  About this time happened the Sunday on which the legacy of twenty pounds was to be divided amongst  such objects as more immediately stood in need of the donation After morning service I had requested the clerk to summon all those mendicants into the vestry which he knew to be particularly indigent and deserving It is almost impossible to do things privately in a village it was soon known to the whole parish that the favour of their benefactor was on this day to be distributed and accordingly the church was on this day crouded with more poor people than had been known there for many years  Too many of them were led thither by the hand of hope rather than of religion The money was divided by the curate of the next parish who officiated at both that and my guardian's since the death of the latter He was an upright  character knew every inhabitant and was therefore a proper person for such an officeThe people assisted went satisfied away and I was truly of opinion that  To be good was to be happy  At the porch of the church as the curate the clerk and I were going home we were intercepted by the sight of a pretty large multitude every member of which seemed to be visited by all the afflictions of Lazarus Lameness blindness filth and nakedness were here in the most formidable array Their numbers baffled computation and every one's business appeared to be how he could most effectually appeal to my  compassion The hospital at Chelsea could scarce have produced such a congress of invalids The clerk was for driving them away with his wand I prevented this and enquired for what they assembled In the true key of complaint they Godblessed my honour and said it was for  money  The curate replied the most needy were already relievedThe beggars displayed their tattered garments lean looks and imperfect limbs I did not know what to do The clerk bid them go home to their own parishes for that they did not belong to us I put my hand into my pocketmy purse was emptyI bid them come to my gate within an hourthey came and I desired the clerk to divide l  more  upon them a sum which I  very luckily happened to have in  halfs crowns  a kind of pieces which my guardian was always fond of hoarding In ten minutes after the clerk disappeared I heard a violent noise at at my gate the beggars dissatisfied with his bounty or rather with his manner of distribution had all fallen upon him and bruised the poor fellow unmercifully they said the men in the vestry had right to no more money than theythey drove the clerk about till he was glad to find shelter in the houseI threw up the fash to expostulatethey muttered before my face and upon the clerk threatening to have them set in the stocks several of the most audacious of them in token of defiance broke my windows with pebblestones About  eight o'clock in the evening another mortifying circumstance fell out for the people in the yard having spent their respective modicums at the alehouse to the great annoyance of many sober disposed people of the parish they at length fallied out in a body and encountered the people of the vestry by whom they esteemed themselves robbed of their right A war of words as usual began the contesta fierce and bloody battle ensued The farmers left their houses to still the riot by authority but they were obliged to retreat with many a broken headthe wives and daughters came next and abused me for throwing away my money and encouraging a set of lazy vermin that did not  belong  to the parishthey said that I might be  ashamed of myself for turning the sabbath day into a day of drunkenness when every good body ought to have the  Testament  in their hands and concluded by observing that there did not use to be such goings on in their poor dead minister's time but indeed what better could be expected from a madbrain harumscarum bit of a  boy    This was but a bad prognostic of future felicity I protest that I meant all for the general satisfaction twenty pounds was to be given away to the poorest of the parish and I took great pains to have the poorest selected and relieveda party of unexpected necessitous creatures invited my charity and that no complaint of partiality might prevail either  against the memory of my guardian or against myself I directed an equal quantity of money to be divided amongst those who were  not  included in the bequeathed bountythe mercenary part of the mob made head against meabused my agent and struck the glass out of my windows instead of carrying in their hands the comforts I had given them to their pining families they steal into an alehouse and pour the bountydown their throatsthey next pick a quarrel with their fellowlabourers break the sconces of their masters and then I am to bear the blame of the whole I am always treated in this manner I think 'Twas just thus with me at schoolI must some how or another have a strange method of  going about benevolent actions or I have peculiar illluckor else my ideas of happiness must be dreadfully confused oror  CHAP XV  The curate who generally reserved all his language for his Sunday duty was at this very time twirling round his band with one hand and holding his pipe up to his mouth with the otherbut feeling the wind attack him through the broken casement he had entrenched himself behind a large screen which extended from one end of the room to the othernot a word said he to the complaints either  of widows wives husbands or daughters and yet rolled his eyes up and down and seemed to listen to every body  Doctor said Iwho could have supposed that from so innocent an action such distressing consequences should arisewho could suppose it I say  Nobodysaid the priest  Might not one have reasonably expected to receive the thanks and tears rather than the reproaches of these poor people  Certainlysaid the priest  Have you my friend ever met these hard returns  Frequentlysaid the priest shaking his head  Don't they make you very unhappy  No doubtsaid the parson  How do you get over them doctor  Smokesaid the priest pointing to his pipe  Is that a specific for the anxieties which arise from ingrateful treatment  I  never  smoke doctorhave you no other remedy for me more in the road of your profession  Surely said the priest  Name it my dear friend for I am truly miserable  PATIENCE said the priestIf a man has patience no crosses nor any misfortunesnor any accidentsnor any distressesnor any  The good priest was now set in for it I drew my chair opposite to his and hoped now for great improvementthe doctor took the pipe from  his lipsa spark fell from it upon his legPatience sir said the doctor exalting his voice is that  blessed beatific divine caelestial  zounds and the devil cried the priest I've scorched the calf of my leg to piecesHe rubbed the part affectedskipped about the room like a madman threw the pipe in the sire and ran out of the house  Go thy ways said I neither from thee nor thy patience will my perplexity of mind be relieved I unlocked my bookcase and read without intermission till twelve o'clock at nightthe volumes were all set to the same tune  Be good  and  be happy    be happy  and  be good  I took up Cato and my bosom bounded when I came to this couplet  'Tis not in mortals to  command  success  But we'll do  more  Semproniuswe'll  deserve  it  I applied the sentiment to my own case and found that it fitted me to a hairI repeated it over and over and I admired it more at every receptionthe clerk knocked at my door and told me that one of the drunken beggars in staggering home had tumbled into a ditch and was drowned and that a wife to a principal farmer was frightened into an untimely labour by the riot and not expected to get over itHonest man replied II am heartily sorry for it but how could I possibly help it I meant  well  the thing has fallen out  ill  remember Mr Clerkremember what the poet says  'Tis not in mortals to command success  But we'll do more Semproniuswe'll deserve it  Sempronius sir said the clerk I don't know for thatbut I tell you the fact He walked off and I believe suspected the sanity of my intellect  CHAP XVI  I set in for a week's close reading 'twas still the same maxim multiplied and modified into different expressions through different volumes  To be good is to be happy  I was determined to try the virtue of the expression beyond the limits of the village I set out for London and in that city I arrived in the sixteenth year of my age after having desired the attorney to give an eye to my affairs at the village during my absenceat my first entrance into the metropolis new sensations took root in my heart Every street was full every shop was busyand every foot was in motionthis said Iis certainly the place to bring every principle and every sentiment to the  test  I took up my lodging at the house of a gentlewoman to whom I was distantly relatedshe received me politely  And now came on a train of trials and a series of events which shall be  related as they recur to my memory  But before I proceed to set down my transactions in the metropolis it is impossible for me to pass a few circumstances that fell out upon the road The social turn of my temper made me prefer a journey in the stage to the solitary luxury of going post I had three miles to ride to the machine in which my fellowpassengers were seated sive minutes before I reach'd the inn nor did this small delay pass unnoticed by the driver who was rubbing his hands together and blowing his fingers upon account of the cold declaring at the same time that he had waited for me till his horses were starved to  death Notwithstanding which he thought proper to ask for something to drink my health thereby detaining us a quarter of an hour longer then having given the hostler his perquisite without which he would certainly have held the coachdoor in his hand at least another quarter of an hour we found ourselves in motion My fellowtravellers were not only muffled by the darkness of the night but were so enveloped in their great coats that though by the intermixture of legs I supposed myself amongst human creatures yet I received no other assurances of the matter till after tossing for about five hours we made a full sick stop to refresh ourselves with breakfast  CHAP XVII  This house had as unfriendly an appearance as ever hung out to the eye of the traveller a signal of welcome that is in other words an invitation for him to spend his money Not a creature was up though every body knew the exact time in which the coach would come in In a garret window indeed glimmered a malancholy candle and after the coachman had smacked his whip about twenty times and reinforced the reports by a pretty considerable number of oaths peculiar to gentlemen of the whip from that garret with the candle between his fingers came the hostler rubbing his eyes and crawling his way to the stable  rather by instinct than a consciousness of knowing what he was about About ten minutes after this the trusty chambermaid whose business was in have every thing in  readiness  against the arrival of the coach came blinking to the door like a buzzard and conducted us to so dark dismal and damp a room that if we had requested the good man of the mansion for the  charity  of a breakfast it would have been difficult to have deposited our miserable carcases in a more unfortable apartmentAnd now it was that my fellow passengers began to convince me they were capable of moving their tongues of which they one and all made use to express the same complaint viz that it was a most shameful thing for travellers to  be treated in that manner upon the roadthat if they expected a coach and six with my lord Lor my lady M the whole house and stables would be illuminated and perhaps half the village at the wheels to gape at their honours but that people who jumble to town in a stage and have a couple of hundred miles to go upon business can neither get sire or candle in the first stage  For my part these things were  new  to me and therefore I contended myself with begging Mrs Betty to bestir herself and get us a dish of tea as expeditiously as she couldIn a little time the faggot began to blazethe kettle began to boil and those little domestic comforts made at last their appearance which removing our disappointments  put the company into a better humourand presently we had leisure and opportunity to contemplate the countenances of one another  CHAP XVIII  Our society consisted of three persons besides myself and all were men one was dressed in a suit of plain light brown with buttons of the samethe brims of his hat were of immense circumference and there was a primitive nicety in the tie of his neckcloth that spoke his characterAnother had a suit of black somewhat faded and the third who was habited in a coat of snuff colour with waistcoat and breeches of black velvet had the air  of a shop about him so palpable that I could almost have sworn to his trade at the first glance When the heart is happy and satisfied the tongue is generally voluble and communicative About the third dish we became sociable and at the entrance of the second plate of toast we knew of what we were each in pursuit of The man in black indeed was extremely reserved said little and sipped his tea or rather played with his teaspoon as if he thought society an interruption The gentleman in brown was of the number of people called quakers travelling  upwards  to attend a solemn meeting of  friends  upon the marriage of a preacher the man in snuffcolour was an inhabitant of the markettown from  whence we came and was going to visit his daughter The most difficult matter remained and that was to disclose  my  business in the capital I told them that mine was a business of benevolence and that I was actually upon the road to London in search of  happiness  The passengers looked upon each other and smiled but every smile was different The coachman came now to acquaint us our half hour was expired and the horses were ready and after passing through the usual ceremonies with the hostler who insisted on his customary six pence notwithstanding his idleness in being found  in bed  and something for Mrs Betty for the trouble of rising up when she was  called  we again set forward on  our journeyas soon as we were pretty well settled the quaker open'd the conversation  CHAP XIX  I could not help smiling friend said he looking sagaciously at the broad flaps of his beaver to hear thee say thou wert journeying towards the great city in search of happiness and yet I as well as thou and these other good brethen at our side as well as weand indeed all the fellowmen upon the earth are engaged in the like  vain  pursuit we are all travellers bound for the same place  though peradventure we take different roads thereto and yet such is the frail nature of the flesh that we are for ever jogging onward and shift about from place to place dissatisfied with our road disgusted with our journey till we put off the  old man  and reach the gloomy gate that leads to the  city of the Saviour    Vanity of vanities saith preacher wisely  all  is vanity  Here the quaker spread his chin upon his chest upon which it descended to the fourth button of his waistcoat and twirling one thumb round the other with his fingers folded together communed with the spirit about the vanity of searching for happiness in a world where happiness was not to be found  Surely sir said I there is a great deal of happiness in the world notwithstanding thisthe quaker Groan'd inwardlyHappinesscried the grocer for such was the calling of the man whose exteriors smelt so strong of the counterhappiness in the worldaye certainly there isI'll answer for that and a great deal of happiness tooI am the happiest man upon earth myself if any man says he's happier I say he'sno matter for thatthe Quaker lifted up the ball of one eye to survey himI am worth five thousand pounds every morning I rise aye and more moneyI have got every shilling by my own  industry  I have a set of good customers to my backmy wife knows how to turn the penny in the shop when I have a mind to smoke my pipe in  the parlour and I make it a rule never to lend a six pence nor borrow a six pence  For what wert thou born friend said the quaker drily Born why to liveaye and to die too said the quakerpish replied the grocer who does not know that but what does  that there argufy  if I can but live merrily and bring up my family honestlykeep the wolf from the door and pay every body their own I have only one child and her I'm now going to seeshe's 'prentice to a mantuamaker in the city If she behaves well and marries to my thinkingand I have a  warm man  in my eye for her why soIf she's headstrong and thinks proper to please  herself  rather than please  me  why  she may beg or starve for what I care  Good GOD exclaimed I with vehemence and is it possibledon't swear interrupted the quaker young manthen turning his head deliberately round towards the grocerand so thou art very happy friend art thou Never was man more soquoth the grocer so that if you are looking for mertiment and heartsease come to to the Sugar loaf I'm your man here he begun to hum the fag end of a ballad"For who is so happy so happy as I"Thy sort of happiness friend returned the quaker I shall never envythou art happy without either  grace  or  good works  to make thee soGood works said the grocer what do you mean by  that I don't owe a penny in the worldI pay  lot  and  scot  I go to church every other Sunday and I never did a wrongful thing in my life Thee may'st be very unserviceable in thy generation for all that said the quakerI am afraid by thy own account thou takest too much care in cherishing thy outward man yet art slow to cherish thy poor brethren Why in what pray does  thy  happiness consist says the grocer archlyIn turning the wanderer into the right way rejoin'd the quakerin feeding the hungry penitent with the  milk  of brotherly love and in cloathing the naked soul with the comfortable  raiment  of righteousnessPshaw cries the grocer you had better feed the poor devils with a pennyworth of my  plumbs How many pennyworth of plumbs may'st thou give away yearly in thy parish said the quaker I tell thee said the grocer I never  pretend  to give away any thingthings are too dear and taxes are too heavy for thatbesides about seventeen years ago I was poor myself and wanted a dinner as much as any body but I never found solk so ready to give  me  any thingno not so much as a bit of breadnot so much as  this  snapping his singers  Surely cried I greatly agitated that ought to be a strong argument to stimulate your  benevolence  Benevolence said the quaker young man is not consined to the mere act of throwing away moneyI never give any  money  myself but then I give store  of  spiritual  foodI preach in the house and tabernacle of the Lord and I travel far and near to bestow religious consolation of the spirit  gratis  whereas that man on the contrary spendeth his substance amongst vain companions or hoardeth it up to swell the pomps of the fleshverily I fear his transgressions are mighty The quaker paused and the grocer winked waggishly upon  me  with one eye and kept looking ironically at the quaker with the otherHere now thought I are two very opposite charactersthe quaker for aught I see is as mercenary as the grocer though their avarice is differently modisied according to the different prejudices of their education  CHAP XX  Pray gentlemen give me leave to ask you a few questions said I Is not to be good to be happythere can be no doubt of it said the quaker Is not benevolence the way to goodnesscertainlywould not you then be happier sir if you were to add a few  corporeal  comforts to the  religious  consolations you bestow for instance if to the milk of brotherly love which is perhaps a delicious diet for the soul you were to add the wholesome milk of a cow to satisfy the natural cravings of the bodyand would it not increase  your  happiness Mr Grocer if not contented with the negative merit of having done no wrong you would now and then condescend to do something absolutely goodsuch as bestowing from the overslowings of your plenty something to those which cannot but look up to your successful circumstances with a little envy and suppose instead of choosing for your daughter you were in a point so important to her to leave the choice to herselffor my own part gentlemen I have a good fortune which I design to dedicate to the service of my fellowcreatures and though I should be sorry to waste my bounty upon the undeserving yet I had rather hazard  such  a mistake than  not indulge  the liberal propensities  of my heartThou talkest like a  young  man said the quaker I I am sure he knows nothing of  trade  said the grocer and if you hold in that mind long I'd lay ten to one you will not have six pence to bless yourself Benevolence indeedits very well to talk of in the pulpit as master Holdfast saysand its very well in your history books and your sermon books but it won't do in the worldnot at alla man may give away all he has and be never the nearerpeople will only laugh at you when all is said and done While you have got money in your pocket to pay the butcher's bill you may always have a hot dish every day aye and sauce into the bargain but if you do all the good in the world and come at last to  want you may pass by a whole market full of meat and I'd lay ten to one the man whom you set up in business will hardly give you a marrowboneHere the quaker groaned bitterly and the grocer taking a paper full of biscuits out of his pockets eat away without offering to distribute his refreshment and then proceeded  CHAP XXI  You talk of benevolence and goodness and  such like  for my part as I said before I never knew any thing but mischief come of any thing but trade Now I'll tell you a story at this instant a poor tatter'd wretch with a bundle of threadbare rags on his backa wooden leghalf an hand and a tenth of an eye came stumping towards the coach to sollicit our commiserationThe driver no sooner beheld him rising from the bank on which he was resting thanprobably to save his passengers the trouble of hearing a dismal storyhe began to spirit up his horses in that kind of  language which defies spelling and which the animals understand as perfectly as the greatest philologist in the world It is a dialect peculiar to the stable and not inserted in any dictionary extant In this dialect the driver now harangued his steeds and as a convincing proof they took the hi  t we felt the wheels spring unde  us by which means the poor lame fellow was soon thrown far behind and the grocer declared it was very well done in the coachman whom he should remember at the next stage  to dram  for his civility The quaker observed the highways and hedges were now so lined with vagrants that sober people could not pass unmolested by such  naughty children  of hypocrisy the  person in brown put his hand as if involuntarily upon his breast and sighedupon looking through the windows I saw the poor beggar at a considerable distance halting on his crutch and giving up the pursuit in despair The coach now arrived at the foot of a steep hill and there stopt awhile and the humane driver who had galloped away from his fellowcreature came to acquaint us how much he would be obliged to us and how charitable it would be if our honours would please to walk up the hill and give the poor jades a bit of a holiday I ordered him immediately to open the door and alighted the gentleman in mourning did the samethe grocer swore he paid for horseslesh and would have it that he  would not stir a foot till he came to the diningplacethat he had walking enough at home and that he would always have his pennyworth for his penny adding he did design to wet the whistle of Mr Whipcord but that he would now put the money to a better use The quaker bid the coachman shut the door and proceed in his journey the fellow muttered between his teeth they were a couple of Hottentots and did not know what belonged to a christian to behave in that manner to dumb creatures He then conversed very pathetically with his horses stroked them on the neck and gradually gained the summit By this time the lame man seeing the carriage make a dead stop and gathering fresh hope or perhaps urged  by extreme hunger approached within a few paces of us I beckoned him to make the best of his way He shook his head as much as to say he apprehended the thing was not practicable I went to him but the asthma was so heavy on his lungs and his breath was so laboriously exerted that he could only testify his necessity by dropping on the only whole knee he had and holding out his hat in his only whole hand I put something in it raised him up and with some difficulty got him to the side of the coach which had made a second pause at the center of the hill He bowed to the gentleman in black who put sixpence into the hat and dropt a tear into the bargain I bid him to try his luck in the coachThe  fellow looked into his hat and a little suffusion of red rambled over his cheek as much as to say he had been already nobly usedI insisted upon his paying his respects to my fellowpassengers He did so the grocer seeing so much money in the hat protested that nothing could exceed his impudence except the extravagant folly of those who had taken so much pains to encourage a vagabondthat he had more in his hat than enough to set up a shop in the country and that he ought to go home to his parish and be whipped into workhouse the quaker said he was a naughty beggar and desired he would move away from the vehicle The poor man said nothing there was no reproach in his eyes  but when he limped again towards us to make a farewel bow they were so full of tears that he turned about as quickly as he decently could to conceal them  CHAP XXII  And now we were at the top of the hill which was indeed one of the cloudcapt kind and the coachman desired us to get in as the Angel was hard by where we should have the best attendance upon the road A dispute now arose upon the subject of giving alms to common beggarsthe quaker said they were ungodly brethren and deserved  no assistance either spiritual or pecuniarythe grocer observed that they always made him sick to look at them and that if they were to hanker about the Sugarloaf he would dite them for a nuisance The silent gentleman for such he might be almost called said it was sometimes hard to tell whether itinerant mendicants merited assistance or not but when a poor wretch without either limbs or cloaths presented himself before the eye there could be neither doubt nor dissiculty in the casewhere there  is  doubt said I I had rather run the risque of misplacing bounty than by not  being  bountiful through a cool and political caution and dread of being wrongthe grocer closed the whole dissertation by that excellent  and new observationthat charity begins at home and that it behoved every man to take care of his family  CHAP XXIII  The sign of the Angel upon which the sunbeams were sporting now displayed itself beside the road and the coachman delighted with the prospect and resolving to impress us with a proper idea of his dexterity resounded the whip and drove us upon the full trot up to the door After we had swallowed our meal a fresh driver observed to us that as the road to the next stage was heavy and dragging  and that as it was winter timethough in fact it was only the fall of the leaf dark came upon us sooner than if it was summer he therefore hoped we would make haste The grocer declared he did not like to be benighted though he had nothing to lose even if he should be stoptthe quaker turned whitethough his natural complexion was rosyat the idea the gentleman in mourning said that he was ready and Iholding out a glass to the driver who tossed it off without any other testimony of gratitude than scraping a dirty boot along the floorfor which the waiter cast an evil eye at him led the way to the machine As soon as we had got into the road I reminded the grocer of his promise to oblige  us with a story He said he was but a bad hand at that sort of work but that if we were inclined to hear the thing rough as it run we might I told him I should thankfully attend the quaker nodded assent and the grocer after once more assuring us he had no knack at storytelling and that Tim Slade the exciseman was twice a match for him thus began  Why as I was going to tell you there was young Bob Blewitt of our parish as fine a scholar and as comely a man as you shall see 'twixt this and London He was one of your benevolent chaps One man he put into a farmanother he set up in a shop another he gave a potion to marry and to several fatherless and  motherless girls he gave dowries As to beggars and sick folk and such like he sent them broth and broken victualsto lying in women whether they had been before parson or not he sent bottles of wine and possets and potecaries and at the end of town he purchased a piece of ground upon which he built a bit of an hospital which I think he called a cradle for old age and people past labour In short and to come at once to the point without running round about my storyhow confoundedly the coach jolts says the grocer and what a dd noise it makesI can't hear myself the quaker bid him not be prophaneThe silent gentleman pulled up one windowI pulled up the other The grocer went on  In short as I said beforewhew whewwhereabouts was Iat the hospital said Iayeaye right continued the grocerthis hospital cost him a pretty round sumhe wanted indeed to build by subscription nono said the gentry o'the neighbourhood that will bring all the vagrants of the country upon us and we have poor enough of our own and for them we have a workhouse Mr Blewitt said he did not mean to build a workhouse but a comfortable sylum I think he called itfor such as can work no longer Howsomdever not a souse could he get only the old curate who has five or six and twenty pounds per year was fool enough to give five pounds towards the schemeso Blewitt carried  on his building alone and cursed was the hour in which he dipped his fingers in mortar and laid the first brick  How so said I eagerly sure this was rearing for himself a monument which ascended figuratively speaking into heavenI don't know for thatbut figure or no figure master Bob Blewett cut but a bad figure in the end In fine you shall seldom here of such a manever doing sommit for somebody or another The upshot was that he was teazed from morning to night with beggars and imposters and vagabonds and bastardsone went with a sorrowful face to beg one thinganother to beg another thingin short every body wanted somethingnow  you shall hear what come of this Come of it sir said I what could come of it but congratulation of heart and universal gratitude the quaker began to humthe grocer smil'd and the cheek of the gentleman in mourning was wet  CHAP XXIV  Now mind cried the grocer mind what tricks were played upon the founder of the feast The labourers pretended to be sick that they might get food for nothing so that the farmers could not get their fieldwork donemany people got into trouble purpose that he should get them out againthe young forward  husseys of the parish got bigbellies purpose that he should see the brats provided for so that this made the justice grunt a littlehe must needs put a large parcel of money into the hands of lawyer Limboevery body knows himI'd as soon build churches with my money as trust he with itwell one night off went master Limbo and got beyond seaand several other things about the same time ran cross and crooked with poor Bob so that in short he found matters sadly altered  Alas said the gentleman in black alas I love and pity him  I worship him said II respect him said the quaker  That's more than other folk did rejoined the grocer He was now  next to penniless As sure as you are alive he stayed till all was gone and his bones came well nigh through his skin before he complained and then he tried to borrow a trifle of folk he had madenot a sixpenny piece could he get in the parish At length the old curate after a deal of persuasion prevailed on him to go and live with  him  though the old fellow could scarely buy a neck of mutton to make sabbathday broth for himself  But GOD said the gentleman in mourning will make him amends yetHe may be in heaven now for aught I know to the contrary cried the grocerI am sure of it said I very like proceeded the grocer for he died about six weeks after this and put the parish to the charge of opening  the ground for him at last Not a doit did he leave behind him except a few old books and picture two old fashioned blackish coats and a bit or two of a shirt as to nonicals he could not afford they and so he preached in sarplusas soon as he was buried and put into the grave which we thought Blewitt would never leaveaffairs were worse than ever Bob was as bad off as a beggar The bettermost people lifted up their shoulders and gave him a bit of dinner first one then another and this they say hurt him for at last the rich made no ceremonies but bid him step down and get a morsel in  kitchen  After thishe never held up his head the poor folks said 'twas a thousand pities such a good gentleman should come to want his kin told him 'twas just  what they expected his friends said he deserved it and the world at first whispered then openly declared that nothing but a madman or a person never brought up to any business would have acted in that manner Here the quaker groan'd louder than ever and holding up his hands as high as his shoulders shook them in a horizontal descension till they fell again with great method and solemnity upon the flaps of his coat The grocer began to yawn and stretch himself and where think you continued he gaping where is Mr Blewitt nowwhy in one of the dirtiest wards in his own hospitalseldom or ever sees any bodynow and then crawls out at dead night and goes into churchyard to visit the grave of the  old curatesometimes is quite  aside  himself and is mashiated to a perfect ottomey and all this is true as sure as you are in this coach  CHAP XXV  How far are we come said I hastilyThe last stone said the grocer was sixtysixI have a great mind to go back replied II would give any money to see Mr Blewitthowever I will not forget to send my compliments to so excellent a character Aye quoth the grocer but while the grass growsyou understand me spare your reproof fir said I no time shall be lostdid he ever taste thy bounty friend cried the quaker  aye has he many a time said the grocer I have given him the offal of plumbs currants raspins of a loaf and such like Dainty diet returned the quaker trulyI cannot express my anxiety for him said IXiety replied the benefactor of raspinswhat signifies talking of thatstick to the main chance Go to church and hear good sermons and read good books and take good advice and keep your money in the till and put the key in your pocket and keep yourself out of debtbut above all mind thisneither lend a sixpence nor borrow six a pence for that's the only way to live take my word for itHere he finished with the selfimportant air of a man who having the world before him did not care  six pence for the interest of any person in it except the concern he took in the welfare of  one  worthless individual namely  himself  Thy story friend said the quaker is too exact a picture of this wicked world I pray thee young friend have the fate of brother Blewitt in thy remembrance If thou hast abundance take care thereof for no man knoweth what shall happen tomorrow and I have myself seen strange things in my time  The shadows of the night now prevailed over the day and the light of some candles at a small distance led me to suppose we were pretty near our destination for the evening however I was mistaken the lights were in a village through which we  were to pass and we had many a long mile to travel to the place of our repose  CHAP XXVI  At length we reached our inn where being shewn into a small but comfortable room I proposed to order a supper The quaker declared he never eat anythat the fraility of his mortality weighed down his spirit and he found himself inclined to slumber So saying he rang the bell for a candle folded himself up in his surtout and in less than ten minutes forgot I doubt not the fate of Mr Blewitt and even the holdingforth which he should give before the brother and sister who became helpmates  in the flesh and yokefellows after God's holy ordinance The grocer wished him a good night protesting nevertheless that for  his  part supper was his best meal upon which declaration I shall only observe that if he meant to deposit more into his belly than he did at dinner few people would choose to board him at the usual rates The gentleman in black declined eating but observed it would be right to order something I declared that I had supped upon Mr Blewitt The grocer thought proper to shew his  want  of wit saying it would he believed be no easy matter to make a meal out of poor Bob as he was certain there was not an ounce of flesh upon his whole carcase upon this sally at which he  laugh'd heartily he applied to a bell which hung in the center of the room and after the waiter had repeated the promise of Comingcoming about ten times he actually made his entrance and was as pert perpendicular an appearance as could be well conceived The grocer ordered a most plentiful and solid banquet wisely considering that as the charges were to be divided into three equal shares and as it was likely there would in reality be no great occasion for more than  one  knife and fork which knife and fork would be nearest to the sides of his own plate the expence upon the whole could not be greater to  himself  than if he had purchased  singly  a very moderate supper While the supper was dressing I could not but take a review of the grocer who instead of drooping  under the fatigues of his corpulence or the natural lassitude which succeeds a journey was all hope eagerness and expectation He began to handle the knife called for a whetstone tucked a towel under his chin smacked his lips in echo to the corkbad us take notice of the stains in the bottle and set the wine before the fire In this situation he sat and filled an elbowchairas fine a figure for the pencil of Hogarth or for Reynolds if Reynolds  chose  to astonish in the  ludicrous  as ever presented itself to the imagination of genius He was a squat thick disproportioned puffing rotundity his face had that jolly plumpness which buries every natural mark of meaning in greasy vacuity In the middle of that face were set two eyes which swam in a stupid fluid that  seemed to be a distillation from tallow and at the bottom was a chin which unusually broadened from the  under  jaw downwards so that instead of terminating in a peak was rolled up at the bottom into a round pellet of flesh under which hung those collops that distinguish men of his habit The thickness of his hands were by no means proportioned to their length nor was there any space from the ear to the shoulder for a cord had it been his fate to be elevated such was the personage that now waddledI will not venture to say walked into the kitchen with a resolution to hasten the cook for having waited near half an hour he declared that if he stayed five minutes longer he should out wait his appetite and then  should not be able to eat a morseltho' he was he must own vastly fond of fish loved roast fowl beyond any thing that was spitteddoated upon cold hamadmired veal cutlets had no objection to pigeon pye and thought mincedveal very tolerable He had not disappeared more than tea minutes before the kitchen was in an uproar and the waiter came skipping into the room to acquaint us that our friend would certainly be murder'd if we did not immediately carry him off We bustled into the kitchen which now presented a scene of caricature and confusion so truly ridiculous that it requires the pens of the immortal Fielding and Smollete to do it justiceIt demands a chapter to itself  CHAP XXVII  The grocer was standing in his shirt offering to box with the best in the place the cook was brandishing the baster the landlord was threatening to destroy the carcase of the grocer an halfpay officer with one arm was clapping our host upon the back the housedog held the grocer by the breeches and the hostess was encouraging Tiger to keep his hold It was some time before we could learn the occasion of the fray for the combatants rather grew more violent than tranquil especially when the grocer ostentatiously swore that he could buy the whole house and afterwards  have more money to spare than any man in company This touched the son of the sword whose face became immediately  regimental  and marching up to the grocer snaped his fingers against that prominent piece of flesh which nature had given him for a nose and which unused to that rigid and soldier like salutation spouted a copious stream which bepainted the prodigious breadth of linen which covered his carcase The grocer however by no means sickened at the sight of blood but grew more sanguine in his resentment for he now dashed his fists about like a furyhis blows were indeed given at random because he was obliged to hold his head down to prevent drinking his own bloodIn one of these blows it  happened that his tremendous paw fell upon the jaws of the landlady who catching him by the ear overset his wig and discovering a fat newshorn pate did so decorate it with the crimson marks of her delicate nails that in less than three minutes his head resembled a new ploughed field only that the surrows were red instead of being earthcolour The landlord had now an opportunity to reinforce his wifethe captain gave the word of command Tiger roar'd out mainly in the midst and the cook emptied the drippingpan upon the back of the miserable grocer whose life was now so critically circumstanced that had not the officer by declaring the victory was completely gained put an end to the contention he  must assuredly have given up the ghost This dreadful fracas as is often the case arose from a very trifling begining upon the grocer's entering the kitchen he thought proper to assume the authority of a man of very considerable consequence and began by acquainting the cook that though he chose to travel in a stage he was not to be trifled with as he could pay for a coach and six if he thought sit adding he believed few that travelled the road knew better what good usage washe then found fault with the cutlets which he said were too thick and too redcomplained that the fowl was an old hen for that her legs were as well guarded as a sighting cock's and that the fire was abundantly too fierce and would scorch  before it warmed through upon this he sallied to the salt box and was proceeding to empty the contents upon the coals when the landlady though not an illtempered woman thought her province of scolding her own servants so cruelly invaded that she desired him in no very gentle voice to desist and on his refusing the request the host himself interposed till at last the grocer recollecting how well he had secured the  mainchance  and taking from thence a pride of heart which frequently emanates from a full purse he told the landlord he was an illbred saucy rascal and that he was a better man than ever stood in his house This being a censure that involved every one present the  aforesaid armless officer thought himself aggrieved and approaching the grocer chucked him under the chin but unluckily the grocer's mouth being then open'd by anger those two ranges of bony fortification caught his tongue till he almost sunk to earth with the violence of the pain And this it was that made him disrobe himself and stand in the posture we at first found him which though heroic was rather unfortunate as somebody in the hurry and heat of battle perhaps to prevent their being made bloody had moved off with his snuffcoloured coat and black velvet waist coat The engagement was however at length over and we led our champion not indeed in triumph but leaning upon the arm of me and  the gentleman in mourning into the room with such a burlesque alteration of figure that benevolence itself must have smiled as she pitied him  The idea even of supper was now his last ideahis first was that of water to wash away his stains his second was a bed to soothe his bruises The landlady was now rather appeased and permitted the chamberlain to shew the poor devil to bed vowing however that she would make him pay smartly for it in the morning As soon as the grocer was gone the gentleman in mourning observed to me that people of low education and little minds were always capable of a silly ostensibility that sooner or later brought them into disgrace Having spent a few minutes more in contemplating  the vanity of this odd and disgusting character and promising to rise early to pursue our journey we parted for the night  CHAP XXVIII  Our rest was interrupted at the dawn The quaker however complained that he was illThe grocer was tolerably mended but swore he would not stir a foot till he recovered every thing he had lost from the biscuits in his pocket to the minutest hair in his peruke As this message was brought us a chaise and four which had been travelling all night came rattling into the yard before which came two servants and one  was at the tail of it The whole house early as it was got out of their beds and hurried to the chaisedoor the bells rang as if the house was on fire and his  honour  was serenaded into the best room by about a dozen domestics The gentleman in black said he knew the traveller Heavens said I what a bustle is here about an individual indeedaye sir replied my friend for such I began to wish he was there is an invariable rule for these thingsa chaise and  pair  commands  attention  a chaise and  four  enforces  homage  but a chaise and  six  claims  adoration  Nor is this obedience paid so often to the personages within as to the idea of the thing itself  we  travel in a common stage 'tis so mechanical a conveyance  that as the waiter and landlords expect little they let us come in and go out as peaceably as if we were the passengers of a waggon If we were to go post we should be used in a different style and 'tis ten to one if the postilions who have a vanity in sitting before their superiors do not transmit a lye from one to another that we are princes incog To tell you the truth said I I am heartily tired of my old companions from whom I have already gained as much knowledge as if I were to travel with them to the world's end and for onceif you will bear me company I will purchase a little attention upon the road by performing the rest of our journey in chaises With all my heart said the gentleman  After drinking a glass of warm wine and having taken leave of our former fellowtravellers we got into a neat carriage which rolled away briskly on the road to London but not before we had run the gauntlet through a new sett of impostors and satisfied the demands of all those who hang round the wheels of an hackney chaise At this additional charge I expressed my surprize Be not alarmed replied the gentleman but think yourself very well off for if you had clapt another pair of horses to the carriage the expectations of the servants would have been raised in proportion Aye and I can tell you the person we saw step out of the chaise and four paid something extra for his gold binding upon the saddlecloths  and even for the trimming upon his waistcoatthough that last circumstance has lost its pristine dignity in a great degree since our barbers taylors and other crasts have of late years  belaced  themselves from top to bottom whenever they make an excursion into the country Yet gold either in or out of the pocket will always have an influence Then respect of this kind is really to be bought said Inot only of this kind rejoined the gentlemen but of almost every other The interchange of all ordinary civilities is a mere verbal traffic and as to compliments upon gay appearances they are so extremely  marketable  that the bargain and sale at Smithfield is not more in the  way of business  CHAP XXIX  Whenever the gentleman in black spoke there was so much serenity and good sense in his remarks shaded and as it were softened by some latent anxiety that I own my curiosity was extremely excited to know more about him His person was tall and spare his complexion extremely pale and somewhat tinged with a faintish yellow there was a pathetic pensive cast in his eyes that rather denoted the languors of incessant uneasiness than the deadness of dissipation and the ruins of a smile which appeared to be  constitutional  gave a philanthropy to his face which defied the depredations of sorrow and time  The sun now had risen above the clouds and promised us an agreeable day and the face of nature even in the decline of the year appeared bright and beautiful There are few calamities so great and few fates so severe as to leave us totally insensibleto the magic of a fine morning A warm sun a clear sky the charm of vegetationthe melody amongst the branchesthe refreshment from the night's reposeand the prospects of surrounding plenty are sufficient to relax the woe of the most  melancholy  traveller Such were their force at present that every feature of my companion underwent a chearful alteration He always spoke  before  in a plaintive voice but as he now bid me observe how fortunate  we were in our weather there was a degree of  that  sort of pleasure in his accent which appears to be inspired by any sudden satisfaction of the heart I improved this humour by turning our discourse into an entertaining channel and it will be soon seen that this gentleman whose name I found to be Greaves was master of every subject had thought  much  and  rightly  and had contemplated every point deserving contemplation with an accuracy a taste and an elegance peculiar to men which have caught instruction from lessons of life a sober exercise of the understanding and a judicious course of study  CHAP XXX  The satisfaction sir said I that I feel from our favourable weather is much heightened by finding myself relieved from the nonsense of my former companionspray what do you think of themI think of them replied Mr Greaves as of men possessing that kind of knowledge which confers the happiness suited to their coarse andI had almost said invulnerable feelingseach is happy according to the habits of his life they are a fresh and by no means a weak instance of a great truth I have long maintained aye and at the expence of many a warm argument  Pray what is itWhy simply this  Education is all in all  I scarce compreGive me leave sir said Mr Greaves putting his two foresingers lightly on my breast I have seen this world and that is a bold word to say from top to bottom and have now past upwards of fortythree yearsI might have said fortysixin a situation which threw me amongst all ranks of people and the result of my whole experience is thisbut my meaning is so prettily express'd by one of our present dramatic poets thatthough I am no friend in general to quotations I cannot resist it in this caseI think it is in the sentimental play of Zarato the best of my memory these are the words  which are intended as an apology for apostacy  I see too plainly custom forms us all  Our thoughts our morals our most fix'd belief  Are consequences of our place of birth  Born beyond GangesI had been a  P  g    In France a  Christian  I am here a    'Tis but instruction all Our parent's hand  Writes on our hearts the first faint characters  Which time retracing deepens into strength  That nothing can efface but death or heaven  In these lines there is not more poetry than truth and truth which extends from pole to pole A mind unaccustomed to remark or inexperienced in life cannot possibly conceive how surprizingly  all  people are influenced  by custom and early instruction It is indeed a proverb with us which proverb is in every mouth that "use is second nature"but thousands search no farther into this matter than just to repeat the  expression  and there leave it Every one knows and feds the fact and that is sufficient to convince us of its universality but I who have occasionally delighted in philosophic studies have taken some painsbut they were extreme pleasing onesto trace the point countained in the lines I have just spoken very minntely and from the closest and the coolest investigation I am led to believe that an insinite quantity of that which passes in the world for vice and virtueobserve I speak not of  natural  good or  evilis totally the operation of  habit  and  custom  and  education  CHAP XXXI  I am quite a child sirsaid I in such speculationsI cannot clearlyI will endeavour to explain myself rejoined the gentleman with great goodnature Mr Pope observes that as the twig is bent the tree's inclined How beautiful and how justly was it said The colour of our future fortune greatly depends upon a few  slight  circumstances that attend us in our nurseryexceptions you know are admitted But pray call to mind your acquaintances some are in businessothers are trained  to pleasure Suppose a child born under every favourable event of temporal prosperitythe father is rich the mother is beautiful its cradle is soft and downy its pap is made of the whitest bread and every accommodation that the little stranger demands is in the highest perfectionIt will not be long before these  softnesses  will have so great an influence upon the body that the infant will imbibe from these blessings an idea of luxurysuppose on the other hand a child which is the offspring of laborious and indigent parentsits birth is effected upon the straw or on sacking without curtains the wind blowing hard through the casementthe mother lies down contented with her small beer caudle and on the third or fourth day she is  up and dandling the babe upon het knee or dancing it in her armsabout the time that the  rich  child begins to know the delicacy of its condition he  poor  one would find itself promising and hardy and in some degree i  ed to the storms of lifelet them he at this period each five years old the one has acquired a sensation of  the other an habit of hardihoodsuppose then about this time it were possible for them to change situations The pennyless lad shall go into the warm villathe rich stripling into the cold cottagewhat would be the consequence exactly the same as if the two  mothers  and  fathers  should exchange All would be distress dilemma confusion and aukwardnessthe pampered youth would  croud over the wretched bit of a blaze made by two sticks laid across a brick and the lad who was bred in a tempest and seasoned to wind and weather would very probably toss his plaything against the fine sashwindow to let in the air and prevent suffocation Thus far I have spoken with respect to the influence of early habits upon the body Let us now see what effect they have upon the mind The connexion betwixt our mortal and immortal part is far closer than betwixt man and wife Nothing can befal the one that is indifferent to the other sympathy implanted by nature is universally reciprocated and the tie is at once tender and forcible  Consequently the minds of those two boys must be affected very sensibly by their respective educations and customs As they grow up those customs will so strengthen that nothing but "death or heaven" can reconcile them to an innovation either in thought word or deed The  poor  boy having heard nothing but unpolished language eat nothing but coarse food and passed his day amongst clowns and cattle will for ever continue in the track and if by any  unlucky  stroke of chance he is called to new pursuits his misery must be dated from the day in which he deserted the spade the ploughshare or the flail The  rich  boy in the mean time rises into  man amidst the clash of carriages the comfort of couches and the luxuries of laziness His ears are accustomed to music flattery and fashion and his eyes are daily charmed with objects of dissipation or delight No possible accident could be more fatal to his peace than a sudden deprivation of these pleasures Take him again into the hut like a fish upon land he finds himself instantly out of his element the greatest transports of the peasant are agony to him and every thing around and within him is as strange as if he had stept into a new world Why is all thismerely because they have been taught to think and feel and act differentlyon the other handbut I  must tire you firI am concerned returned I Mr Greaves should think an apology necessary for bestowing upon me the greatest pleasure upon earthMr Greaves paused a little bowed and proceeded  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
