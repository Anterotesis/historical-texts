Westminster and J ALMON in Piccadilly MDCCLXIII  THE GHOST BOOK IV  COXCOMBS  who vainly make pretence  To something of exalted sense  'Bove other men and  gravely wise    Affect those pleasures to despise  Which merely to the eye confin'd  Bring no improvement to the mind  Rail at all pomp They would not go  For millions to a  PuppetShow    Nor can forgive the mighty crime  Of countenancing  Pantomime    No not at COVENTGARDEN where  Without a head for play or play'r  Or could a head be found most fit  Without one play'r to second it  They must obeying  Folly  's call  Thrive by mere shew or not at all  With these  grave  Fops who bless their brains  Most cruel to themselves take pains  For wretchedness and would be thought  Much wiser than a wise man ought  For his own happiness to be  Who what they hear and what they see  And what they smell and taste and feel  Distrust till REASON sets her seal  And by long trains of consequences  Ensur'd gives Sanction to the  Senses    Who would not Heav'n forbid it waste  One hour in what the World calls Taste  Nor fondly deign to laugh or cry  Unless they know some reason why  With these  grave  Fops whose system seems  To give up Certainty for dreams  The  Eye  of Man is understood  As for no other purpose good  Than as a door thro' which of course  Their passage crouding objects force  A downright Usher to admit  NewComers to the Court of  Wit    Good GRAVITY forbear thy spleen  When I say  Wit  I  Wisdom  mean  Where such the practice of the Court  Which legal Precedents support  Not one Idea is allow'd  To pass unquestion'd in the crowd  But e're It can obtain the grace  Of holding in the brain a place  Before the Chief in Congregation  Must stand a  strict Examination    Not such as  Those  who PHYSIC twirl  Full fraught with death from ev'ry curl  Who prove with all becoming State  Their voice to be the voice of Fate  Prepar'd with  Essence Drop  and  Pill    To be another WARD or HILL  Before they can obtain their Ends  To sign Deathwarrants for their Friends  And talents vast as their's employ  Secundum Artem  to destroy  Must pass or Laws their rage restrain  Before the Chiefs of  WarwickLane    Thrice happy  Lane  where uncontroul'd  In  Pow'r  and  Lethargy  grown old  Most fit to take in this blest Land  The reins which fell from WYNDHAM's hand  Her lawful throne great DULLNESS rears  Still more herself as more in Years  Where She and who shall dare deny  Her right when REEVES and CHAUNCY's by  Calling to mind in antient time  One GARTH who err'd in Wit and Rhime  Ordains from henceforth to admit  None of the rebel Sons of Wit  And makes it her peculiar care  That SCHOMBERG never shall be there  Not such as  Those  whom FOLLY trains  To Letters tho' unbless'd with brains  Who destitute of pow'r and will  To learn are kept to learning still  Whose heads when other methods fail  Receive instruction from the tail  Because their Sires a common case  Which brings the Children to disgrace  Imagine it a certain rule  They never could beget a Fool  Must pass or must  compound for  ere  The  Chaplain  full of beef and pray'r  Will give his  reverend Permit    Announcing them for Orders fit  So that the Prelate what's a Name  All Prelates now are much the same  May with a conscience safe and quiet  With holy hands lay on that  Fiat    Which doth all faculties dispense  All Sanctity all Faith all Sense  Makes MADAN quite a Saint appear  And makes an Oracle of CHEERE  Not such as in that solemn seat  Where the  nine Ladies  hold retreat  The  Ladies nine  who as we're told  Scorning those haunts they lov'd of old  The banks of ISIS now prefer  Nor will one hour from OXFORD stir  Are held for form which BALAAM's  Ass  As well as BALAAM's self might pass  And with his Master take degrees  Could he contrive to pay the Fees  Men of sound parts who deeply read  O'erload the Storehouse of the head  With furniture they ne'er can use  Cannot forgive our rambling Muse  This wild excursion cannot see  Why  Physic  and  Divinity    To the Surprize of all beholders  Are lugg'd in by the head and shoulders  Or how in any point of view  OXFORD hath any thing to do  But Men of nice and subtle Learning  Remarkable for quick discerning  Thro' Spectacles of critic mould  Without instruction will behold  That We a Method here have got  To shew What is by What is not  And that our drift  Parenthesis  For once apart is briefly this  Within the brain's most secret cells  A certain  Lord Chief Justice  dwells  Of sov'reign pow'r whom One and All  With common Voice We REASON call  Tho' for the purposes of Satire  A name in Truth is no great Matter  JEFFERIES or MANSFIELD which You will  It means a  Lord Chief Justice  still  Here  so our great Projectors say  The Senses all must homage pay  Hither  They all must tribute bring  And prostrate fall before their King  Whatever unto them is brought  Is carry'd on the wings of Thought  Before his throne where in full state  He on their merits holds debate  Examines Crossexamines Weighs  Their right to censure or to praise  Nor doth his equal voice depend  On narrow Views of foe and friend  Nor can or flattery or force  Divert him from his steady course  The Channel of Enquiry's clear  No  sham Examination  's here  He upright Justicer no doubt  Ad libitum  puts in and out  Adjusts and settles in a trice  What Virtue is and What is Vice  What is Perfection what Defect  What we must chuse and what reject  He takes upon him to explain  What Pleasure is and what is Pain  Whilst We obedient to the Whim  And resting all our faith on him  True Members of the  Stoic  weal  Must learn to think and cease to feel  This glorious System form'd for Man  To practise when and how he can  If the five Senses in alliance  To Reason hurl a proud defiance  And tho' oft conquer'd yet unbroke  Endeavour to throw off that yoke  Which they a greater slav'ry hold  Than Jewish Bondage was of old  Or if They something touch'd with shame  Allow him to retain the name  Of Royalty and as in Sport  To hold a mimic formal Court  Permitted no uncommon thing  To be a kind of Puppet King  And suffer'd by the way of toy  To hold a globe but not employ  Our  Systemmongers  struck with fear  Prognosticate destruction near  All things to Anarchy must run  The little World of Man's undone  Nay should the  Eye  that nicest Sense  Neglect to send intelligence  Unto the Brain distinct and clear  Of all that passes in her sphere  Should She presumptuous joy receive  Without the Understanding's leave  They deem it rank and daring Treason  Against the Monarchy of REASON  Not thinking tho' they're  wondrous  wise  That few have  Reason  most have  Eyes    So that the Pleasures of the Mind  To a small circle are confin'd  Whilst those which to the Senses fall  Become the Property of All  Besides and this is sure a Case  Not much at present out of place  Where NATURE Reason doth deny  No Art can that defect supply  But if for it is our intent  Fairly to state the argument  A Man should want an eye or two  The Remedy is sure tho' new  The Cure's at handno need of Fear  For proofbehold the CHEVALIER  As well prepar'd beyond all doubt  To put Eyes in as put them out  But Argument apart which tends  T' embitter foes and sep'rate friends  Nor turn'd apostate for the  Nine    Would I tho' bred up a Divine  And foe of course to Reason's weal  Widen that breach I cannot heal  By his own Sense and Feelings taught  In speech as lib'ral as in thought  Let ev'ry Man enjoy his whim  What's He to Me or I to him  Might I tho' never rob'd in  Ermine    A matter of this weight determine  No Penalties should settled be  To force men to Hypocrisy  To make them ape an awkward zeal  And feeling not pretend to feel  I would not have might sentence rest  Finally fix'd within my breast  E'en ANNET censur'd and confin'd  Because we're of a diff'rent mind  NATURE who in her act most free  Herself delights in Liberty  Profuse in Love and without bound  Pours joy on ev'ry creature round  Whom yet was ev'ry bounty shed  In double Portions on our head  We could not truly bounteous call  If FREEDOM did not crown them all  By Providence forbid to stray  Brutes  never can mistake their way  Determin'd still they plod along  By Instinct neither right nor wrong  But Man had he the heart to use  His Freedom hath a right to chuse  Whether He acts or well or ill  Depends entirely on his will  To her last work her fav'rite Man  Is giv'n on NATURE's better plan  A Privilege in pow'r to  err    Nor let this phrase resentment stir  Amongst the grave ones since indeed  The little merit Man can plead  In doing well dependeth still  Upon his pow'r of doing ill  Opinions should be free as air  No man whate'er his rank whate'er  His Qualities a claim can found  That my Opinion must be bound  And square with his such slavish chains  From foes the lib'ral soul disdains  Nor can tho' true to friendship bend  To wear them even from a friend  Let Those who rigid Judgment own  Submissive bow at Judgment's throne  And if They of no value hold  Pleasure till Pleasure is grown cold  Pall'd and insipid forc'd to wait  For Judgment's regular debate  To give it warrant let them find  Dull Subjects suited to their mind  Their's be slow Wisdom Be  my  plan  To live as merry as I can  Regardless as the fashions go  Whether there's Reason for't or no  Be my employment here on earth  To give a lib'ral scope to mirth  Life's barren vale with flow'rs t' adorn  And pluck a rose from ev'ry thorn  But if by Error led astray  I chance to wander from my way  Let no blind guide observe in spite  I'm wrong who cannot set me right  That Doctor could I ne'er endure  Who found disease and not a cure  Nor can I hold that man a friend  Whose zeal a helping hand shall lend  To open happy Folly's eyes  And making wretched make me wise  For next a Truth which can't admit  Reproof from Wisdom or from Wit  To  being  happy here below  Is to  believe  that we are so  Some few in  knowledge  find relief  I place my comfort in  belief    Some for  Reality  may call  FANCY to me is All in All  Imagination  thro' the trick  Of Doctors often makes us sick  And why let any Sophist tell  May it not likewise make us well  This am I sure whate'er our view  Whatever shadows we pursue  For our pursuits be what they will  Are little more than shadows still  Too swift they fly too swift and strong  For man to catch or hold them long  But Joys which in the FANCY live  Each moment to each man may give  True to himself and true to ease  He softens Fate's severe decrees  And can a Mortal wish for more  Creates and makes himself new o'er  Mocks boasted vain  Reality    And  Is  whate'er he wants to Be  Hail FANCYto thy pow'r I owe  Deliv'rance from the gripe of Woe  To Thee I owe a mighty debt  Which Gratitude shall ne'er forget  Whilst Mem'ry can her force employ  A large encrease of ev'ry joy  When at my doors too strongly barr'd  Authority  had plac'd a guard  A  knavish  guard ordain'd by Law  To keep  poor Honesty  in awe  Authority  severe and stern  To intercept my wish'd return  When Foes grew proud and Friends grew cool  And Laughter seiz'd each sober fool  When Candour started in amaze  And meaning censure hinted praise  When Prudence lifting up her eyes  And hands thank'd Heav'n that she was wise  When All around Me with an air  Of hopeless Sorrow look'd Despair  When They or said or seem'd to say  There is but one one only way  Better and be advis'd by us  Not be at all than to be thus  When Virtue shunn'd the shock and Pride  Disabled lay by Virtue's side  Too weak my ruffled soul to chear  Which could not hope yet would not fear  Health in her motion the wild grace  Of Pleasure speaking in her face  Dull Regularity thrown by  And Comfort beaming from her eye  FANCY in richest robes array'd  Came smiling forth and brought me aid  Came smiling o'er that dreadful time  And more to bless me came in  Rhime    Nor is her Pow'r to Me confin'd  It spreads It comprehends Mankind  When to the Spiritstirring sound  Of Trumpets breathing Courage round  And Fifes well mingled to restrain  And bring that Courage down again  Or to the melancholy knell  Of the dull deep and doleful bell  Such as of late the good  Saint Bride  Muffled to mortify the pride  Of those who ENGLAND quite forgot  Paid their vile homage to the SCOT  Where ASGILL held the foremost place  Whilst my Lord figur'd at a race  Processions  'tis not worth debate  Whether They are of Stage or State  Move on so very very slow  'Tis doubtful if they move or no  When the Performers all the while  Mechanically frown or smile  Or with a dull and stupid stare  A vacancy of Sense declare  Or with downbending eye seem wrought  Into a Labyrinth of Thought  Where Reason wanders still in doubt  And once got in cannot get out  What cause sufficient can we find  To satisfy a thinking mind  Why dup'd by such vain farces Man  Descends to act on such a plan  Why They who hold themselves divine  Can in such wretched follies join  Strutting like Peacocks or like Crows  Themselves  and  Nature  to expose  What Cause but that you'll understand  We have our Remedy at hand  That if perchance we start a doubt  Ere it is fix'd we wipe it out  As Surgeons when they lop a limb  Whether for Profit Fame or Whim  Or mere experiment to try  Must always have a  Styptic  by  FANCY steps in and stamps that  real    Which  ipso facto  is  Ideal    Can none remember yes I know  All must remember that rare show  When to the Country SENSE went down  And Fools came flocking up to Town  When  Knights  a work which all admit  To be for  Knighthood  much unfit  Built booths for hire when  Parsons  play'd  In robes  Canonical  array'd  And Fiddling join'd the  Smithfield  dance  The price of Tickets to advance  Or unto Tapsters turn'd dealt out  Running from Booth to Booth about  To ev'ry Scoundrel by retail  True pennyworths of Beef and Ale  Then first prepar'd by bringing beer in  For present grand  Electioneering    When  Heralds  running all about  To bring in Order turn'd it Out  When by the  prudent Marshal  's care  Lest the rude populace should stare  And with unhallow'd eyes profane  Gay Puppets of Patrician strain  The whole Procession as in spite  Unheard unseen stole off by Night  When our Lov'd Monarch nothing loth  Solemnly took that sacred oath  Whence mutual firm agreements spring  Betwixt the  Subject  and the  King    By which in usual manner crown'd  His  Head  his  Heart  his  Hands  he bound  Against  himself  should Passion stir  The least Propensity to err  Against all  Slaves  who might prepare  Or open force or hidden snare  That  glorious  CHARTER to maintain  By which We serve and He must reign  Then FANCY with unbounded sway  Revell'd sole Mistress of the day  And wrought such wonders as might make  Egyptian  Sorcerers forsake  Their baffled mockeries and own  The Palm of  Magic  Her's alone  A KNIGHT who in the silken lap  Of lazy Peace had liv'd on Pap  Who never yet had dar'd to roam  'Bove ten or twenty miles from home  Nor even that unless a  Guide  Was plac'd to amble by his side  And troops of Slaves were spread around  To keep his Honour safe and sound  Who could not suffer for his life  A Point to sword or Edge to knife  And always fainted at the sight  Of Blood tho' 'twas not shed in fight  Who disinherited one Son  For firing off an  Elder  Gun  And whipt another six years old  Because the Boy presumptuous bold  To Madness likely to become  A very Swiss had beat a drum  Tho' it appear'd an instrument  Most  peaceable  and  innocent    Having from first been in the hands  And service of the  City Bands  Grac'd with those ensigns which were meant  To further Honour's dread intent  The Minds of Warriors to inflame  And spur them on to deeds of Fame  With little Sword large Spurs high Feather  Fearless of ev'ry thing but Weather  And all must own who pay regard  To Charity it had been hard  That in his very first  Campaign  His  Honours  should be soil'd with rain  A Hero all at once became  And seeing others much the same  In point of Valour as himself  Who leave their Courage on a shelf  From Year to Year till some such rout  In proper season calls it out  Strutted look'd big and swagger'd more  Than ever Hero did before  Look'd up Look'd down Look'd all around  Like MAVORS grimly smil'd and frown'd  Seem'd Heav'n and Earth and Hell to call  To fight that he might rout them all  And personated Valour's style  So long Spectators to beguile  That passing strange and wondrous true  Himself at last believ'd it too  Nor for a time could he discern  Till Truth and Darkness took their turn  So well did FANCY play her part  That Coward still was at the heart  WHIFFLE who knows not WHIFFLE's name  By the impartial voice of fame  Recorded first thro' all this land  In Vanity's illustrious band  Who by all bounteous Nature meant  For offices of hardiment  A modern HERCULES at least  To rid the world of each wild beast  Of each wild beast which came in view  Whether on four legs or on two  Degenerate delights to prove  His force on the  Parade  of Love  Disclaims the joys which camps afford  And for the Distaff quits the sword  Who fond of women would appear  To public eye and public ear  But when in private let's them know  How little they can trust to show  Who sports a Woman as of course  Just as a Jockey shews a horse  And then returns her to the stable  Or vainly plants her at his table  Where he would rather VENUS find  So pall'd and so deprav'd his mind  Than by some great occasion led  To seize Her panting in her bed  Burning with more than mortal fires  And melting in her own desires  Who ripe in years is yet a child  Thro' fashion not thro' feeling wild  Whate'er in others who proceed  As Sense and Nature have decreed  From real passion flows in him  Is mere effect of mode and whim  Who Laughs a very common way  Because he nothing has to say  As your  choice  SPIRITS oaths dispense  To fill up vacancies of Sense  Who having some small Sense defies it  Or using always misapplies it  Who now and then brings something forth  Which seems indeed of Sterling Worth  Something by sudden Start and Fit  Which at a distance looks like wit  But on Examination near  To his confusion will appear  By Truth's fair glass to be at best  A Threadbare Jester's threadbare jest  Who frisks and dances thro' the street  Sings without voice rides without seat  Plays o'er his tricks like AESOP's Ass  A  gratis  fool to all who pass  Who riots tho' he loves not waste  Whores without lust drinks without taste  Acts without sense talks without thought  Does every thing but what he ought  Who led by forms without the pow'r  Of Vice is Vicious who one hour  Proud without Pride the next will be  Humble without Humility  Whose Vanity we all discern  The Spring on which his actions turn  Whose aim in erring is to err  So that he may be singular  And all his utmost wishes mean  Is tho' he's laugh'd at to be seen  Such  for when FLATT'RY's soothing strain  Had robb'd the Muse of her disdain  And found a method to persuade  Her art to soften ev'ry shade  JUSTICE enrag'd the pencil snatch'd  From her degen'rate hand and scratch'd  Out ev'ry trace then quick as thought  From life this striking likeness caught  In Mind in Manners and in Mien  Such  WHIFFLE came and such was seen  In the World's eye but strange to tell  Misled by FANCY's magic spell  Deceiv'd not dreaming of deceit  Cheated but happy in the cheat  Was more than human in his own  O bow bow All at FANCY's throne  Whose Pow'r could make so vile an Elf  With Patience bear that thing  himself    But Mistress of each art to please  Creative  FANCY what are these  These  Pageants of a trifler's Pen  To what thy Pow'r effected then  Familiar with the human mind  As swift and subtle as the wind  Which we all feel yet no one knows  Or whence it comes or where it goes  FANCY at  once  in ev'ry part  Possess'd the Eye the Head the Heart  And in a thousand forms array'd  A thousand various gambols play'd  Here  in a Face which well might ask  The Privilege to wear a mask  In spite of Law and Justice teach  For public good t'excuse the breach  Within the furrow of a wrinkle  'Twixt Eyes which could not shine but twinkle  Like Centinels i' th' starry way  Who wait for the return of day  Almost burnt out and seem to keep  Their watch like Soldiers in their sleep  Or like those lamps which by the pow'r  Of Law must burn from hour to hour  Else they without redemption fall  Under the terrors of that Hall  Which once notorious for a  hop    Is now become  a Justiceshop    Which are so manag'd to go out  Just when the time comes round about  Which yet thro' emulation strive  To keep their dying light alive  And not uncommon as we find  Amongst the children of mankind  As they grow weaker would seem stronger  And burn a little little longer  FANCY betwixt such eyes enshrin'd  No brush to daub no mill to grind  Thrice wav'd her wand around whose force  Chang'd in an instant Nature's course  And hardly credible in Rhime  Not only stopp'd but call'd back Time  The Face of ev'ry wrinkle clear'd  Smooth as the floating stream appear'd  Down the Neck ringlets spread their flame  The Neck admiring whence they came  On the Arch'd Brow the  Graces  play'd  On the full Bosom  Cupid  laid  Suns  from their proper orbits sent  Became for Eyes a supplement  Teeth white as ever Teeth were seen  Deliver'd from the hand of GREEN  Started in regular array  Like TrainBands on a grand Fieldday  Into the Gums which would have fled  But wond'ring turn'd from white to red  Quite alter'd was the whole machine  And Lady was fifteen  Here  She made lordly temples rise  Before the pious DASHWOOD's eyes  Temples which built aloft in air  May serve for show if not for pray'r  In solemn form Herself before  Array'd like  Faith  the Bible bore  There  over MELCOMB's feather'd head  Who quite a man of Gingerbread  Savour'd in talk in dress and phyz  More of another World than this  To a  dwarf Muse a Giant Page    The last grave Fop of the last Age  In a superb and feather'd hearse  Bescutcheon'd  and  betagg'd  with Verse  Which to Beholders from afar  Appear'd like a triumphal Car  She rode in a  cast  Rainbow clad  There  throwing off the  hallow'd plaid    Naked as when in those drear Cells  Where  Selfbless'd Selfcurs'd  MADNESS dwells  PLEASURE on whom in  Laughter  's shape  FRENZY had perfected a rape  First brought her forth before her time  Wild Witness of her shame and crime  Driving before an Idol band  Of driv'ling STUARTS hand in hand  Some who to curse Mankind had Wore  A Crown they ne'er must think of more  Others whose baby brows were grac'd  With Paper Crowns and Toys of Paste  She Jigg'd and playing on the Flute  Spread raptures o'er the soul of BUTE  Big with vast hopes some mighty plan  Which wrought the busy soul of man  To her full bent the CIVIL LAW  Fit  Code  to keep a world in awe  Bound o'er his brows fair to behold  As  Jewish Frontlets  were of old  The famous CHARTER of our land  Defac'd and mangled in his hand  As one whom deepest thoughts employ  But deepest thoughts of truest joy  Serious and slow he strode he stalk'd  Before him troops of Heroes walk'd  Whom best He lov'd of Heroes crown'd  By TORIES guarded all around  Dull solemn pleasure in his face  He saw the honours of his race  He saw their lineal glories rise  And touch'd or seem'd to touch the skies  Not the most distant mark of fear  No sign of  axe  or  scaffold  near  Not one curs'd thought to cross his will  Of such a place as  Tower Hill    Curse on this  Muse  a flippant Jade  A Shrew like ev'ry other Maid  Who turns the corner of nineteen  Devour'd with peevishness and spleen  Her Tongue for as when bound for life  The Husband suffers for the Wife  So if in any works of rhime  Perchance there blunders out a crime  Poor Culprit Bards must always rue it  Altho' 'tis plain the Muses do it  Sooner or later cannot fail  To send me headlong to a jail  Whate'er my theme our themes we chuse  In modern days without a  Muse    Just as a Father will provide  To join a Bridegroom and a Bride  As if tho' they must be the Play'rs  The game was wholly  his  not  theirs    Whate'er my theme the  Muse  who still  Owns no direction but her will  Flies off and ere I could expect  By ways oblique and indirect  At once quite over head and ears  In fatal  Politics  appears  Time was and if I ought discern  Of Fate that Time shall soon return  When  decent  and  demure  at least  As grave and dull as any Priest  I could see  Vice  in robes array'd  Could see the game of  Folly  play'd  Successfully in Fortune's school  Without exclaiming rogue or fool  Time was when nothing loth or proud  I lacquied with the fawning crowd  Scoundrels in Office and would bow  To Cyphers great in place but now  Upright I stand as if wise Fate  To compliment a shatter'd state  Had me like ATLAS hither sent  To shoulder up the firmament  And if I stoop'd with gen'ral crack  The Heavens would tumble from my back  Time was when rank and situation  Secur'd the great Ones of the Nation  From all controul  Satire  and  Law  Kept only little Knaves in awe  But now  Decorum  lost I stand  Bemus'd  a Pencil in my hand  And dead to ev'ry sense of shame  Careless of Safety and of Fame  The names of Scoundrels minute down  And Libel more than half the Town  How can a Statesman be secure  In all his Villanies if poor  And dirty Authors thus shall dare  To lay his rotten bosom bare  Muses  should pass away their time  In dressing out the Poet's rhime  With Bills and Ribbands and array  Each line in harmless taste tho' gay  When the hot burning Fit is on  They should regale their restless Son  With something to allay his rage  Some cool Castalian Beverage  Or some such draught tho'  They  'tis plain  Taking the Muses name in vain  Know nothing of their real court  And only fable from report  As makes a WHITEHEAD's  Ode  go down  Or slakes the  Feverette  of  Brown  But who would in his Senses think  Of Muses Giving gall to drink  Or that their folly should afford  To raving Poets Gun or Sword  Poets were ne'er design'd by fate  To meddle with affairs of State  Nor should if we may speak our thought  Truely as men of Honour ought  Sound Policy their rage admit  To Launch the thunderbolts of Wit  About those heads which when they're shot  Cant't tell if 'twas by Wit or not  These things well known what Devil in spite  Can have seduc'd me thus to write  Out of that road which must have led  To riches without heart or head  Into that road which had I more  Than ever Poet had before  Of Wit and Virtue in disgrace  Would keep me still and out of place  Which if some  Judge  You'll understand  One famous famous thro' the land  For  making  Law should stand my friend  At last may in a Pill'ry end  And all this I myself admit  Without one cause to lead to it  For instance nowthis bookthe GHOST  Methinks I hear some Critic Post  Remark most gravely"The first word  Which we about the Ghost have heard"  Peace my good Sirnot quite so fast  What is the first may be the last  Which is a point all must agree  Cannot depend on You or Me  FANNY no Ghost of common mould  Is not by forms to be controul'd  To keep her state and shew her skill  She never comes but when she will  I wrote and wrote perhaps you doubt  And shrewdly what I wrote about  Believe me much to my disgrace  I too am in the selfsame case  But still I wrote till FANNY came  Impatient nor could any shame  On me with equal justice fall  If She had never come at all  An Underling I could not stir  Without the Cue thrown out by her  Nor from the subject aid receive  Until She came and gave me leave  So that Ye Sons of Erudition  Mark this is but a supposition  Nor would I to so wise a nation  Suggest it as a  Revelation    If henceforth dully turning o'er  Page after Page Ye read no more  Of FANNY who in Sea or Air  May be departed God knows where  Rail at jilt Fortune but agree  No censure can be laid on me  For sure the cause let MANSFIELD try  FANNY is in the fault not I  But to returnand this I hold  A secret worth its weight in gold  To those who write as I write now  Not to mind where they go or how  Thro' ditch thro' bog o'er hedge and stile  Make it but worth the Reader's while  And keep a passage fair and plain  Always to bring him back again  Thro' dirt who scruples to approach  At pleasure's call to take a coach  But we should think the man a clown  Who in the dirt should set us down  But to returnif WIT who ne'er  The shackles of restrain could bear  In wayward humour should refuse  Her timely succour to the  Muse    And to no rules and orders tied  Roughly deny to be her guide  She must renounce  Decorum  's plan  And get back when and how she can  As  Parsons  who without pretext  As soon as mention'd quit their text  And to promote Sleep's genial pow'r  Grope in the dark for half an hour  Give no more Reason for we know  Reason is vulgar mean and low  Why they come back should it befal  That ever they come back at all  Into the road to end their rout  Than they can give Why they went out  But to returnthis Bookthe GHOST  A mere amusement at the most  A trifle fit to wear away  The horrors of a rainy day  A slight shot silk for summer wear  Just as our modern Statesmen are  If rigid honesty permit  That I for once purloin the Wit  Of him who were we all to steal  Is much too rich the theft to feel  Yet in this Book where Ease should join  With Mirth to  sugar  ev'ry line  Where it should all be mere  Chit Chat    Lively Goodhumour'd and  all that    Where  honest  SATIRE in disgrace  Should not so much as shew her face  The Shrew o'erleaping all due bounds  Breaks into Laughter's sacred grounds  And in contempt plays o'er her tricks  In  Science Trade  and  Politics    But why should the distemper'd Scold  Attempt to blacken Men enroll'd  In Pow'r's dread book whose mighty skill  Can twist an Empire to their will  Whose Voice is Fate and on their tongue  Law Liberty  and  Life  are hung  Whom on enquiry Truth shall find  With STUARTS  link'd  time out of mind  Superior to their Country's Laws  Defenders of a Tyrant's cause  Men who the same damn'd maxims hold  Darkly  which they avow'd of old  Who

 And to that Sandbank adding weight  Which is already much too great  What of that  Bridge  which void of Sense  But well supplied with impudence  Englishmen  knowing not the  Guild    Thought they

The Trumpethark it speaksIt swells  The loud full harmony It tells  The time at hand when DULLMAN led  By form his Citizens must head  And march those troops which at his call  Were now assembled to  GuildHall    On matters of importance great  To  Court  and  City Church  and  State    From end to end the sound makes way  All hear the Signal and obey  But DULLMAN who his charge forgot  By MORPHEUS fetter'd heard it not  Nor could so sound he slept and fast  Hear any Trumpet but the last  CRAPE ever true and trusty known  Stole from the Maid's bed to his own  Then in the Spirituals of pride  Planted himself at DULLMAN's side  Thrice  did the everfaithful Slave  With voice which might have reach'd the grave  And broke death's adamantine chain  On DULLMAN call but call'd in vain  Thrice  with an arm which might have made  The THEBAN Boxer curse his trade  The drone he shook who rear'd the head  And  thrice  fell backward on his bed  What could be done where force hath fail'd  Policy often hath prevail'd  And what an inference most plain  Had been CRAPE thought might be again  Under his pillow still in mind  The Proverb kept  fast bind fast find    Each blessed night the keys were laid  Which CRAPE to draw away assay'd  What not the pow'r of voice or arm  Could do this did and broke the charm  Quick started He with stupid stare  For all his little Soul was there  Behold him taken up rubb'd down  In ElbowChair and MorningGown  Behold him in his latter bloom  Stripp'd wash'd and sprinkled with perfume  Behold him bending with the weight  Of Robes and trumpery of State  Behold him for the Maxim's true  Whate'er we by another do  We do ourselves and Chaplain paid  Like slaves in ev'ry other trade  Had mutter'd over God knows what  Something which he by heart had got  Having as usual said his pray'rs  Go  titter totter  to the stairs  Behold him for descent prepare  With one foot trembling in the air  He  starts  he  pauses  on the brink  And hard to credit seems to  think    Thro' his whole train the Chaplain gave  The proper cue to ev'ry slave  At once as with infection caught  Each  started paus'd  and  aim'd  at thought  He turns and they turn big with care  He waddles to his ElbowChair  Squats  down and silent for a season  At last with CRAPE begins to reason  But first of all he made a sign  That ev'ry soul but the  Divine    Should quit the room in him he knows  He may all confidence repose  CRAPEtho' I'm yet not quite awake  Before this awful step I take  On which my future all depends  I ought to know my foes and friends  By foes and friends observe me still  I mean not those who well or ill  Perhaps may wish me but those who  Have't in their pow'r to do it too  Now if attentive to the State  In too much hurry to be great  Or thro' much zeal a motive CRAPE  Deserving praise into a scrape  I like a Fool am got no doubt  I like a Wise Man should get out  Not that remark without replies  I say that to get out is wise  Or by the very selfsame rule  That to get in was like a Fool  The marrow of this argument  Must wholly rest on the event  And therefore which is really hard  Against events too I must guard  Should things continue as they  stand    And BUTE prevail thro' all the land  Without a rival by his aid  My fortunes in a trice are made  Nay Honours on my zeal may smile  And stamp me Earl of some great Isle  But if a matter of much doubt  The present Minister goes out  Fain would I know on what pretext  I can stand fairly with the next  For as my aim at ev'ry hour  Is to be well with those in pow'r  And my material point of view  Whoever's in to be in too  I should not like a blockhead chuse  To gain  these  so as  those  to lose  'Tis good in ev'ry case You know  To have two strings unto our bow  As one in wonder lost CRAPE view'd  His Lord who thus his speech pursued  This my good CRAPE is my grand point  And as the times are out of joint  The greater caution is requir'd  To bring about the point desir'd  What I would wish to bring about  Cannot admit a moment's doubt  The matter in dispute You know  Is what we call the  quomodo    That be thy taskThe  Rev'rend  Slave  Becoming in a moment grave  Fixt to the ground and rooted stood  Just like a man cut out of wood  Such as we see without the least  Reflexion glancing on the Priest  One or more planted up and down  Almost in ev'ry Church in town  He stood some minutes then like one  Who wish'd the matter might be done  But could not do it shook his head  And thus the man of Sorrow said  Hard is this task too hard I swear  By much too hard for me to bear  Beyond expression hard my part  Could mighty DULLMAN see my heart  When He alas makes known a will  Which CRAPE's not able to fulfil  Was ever my obedience barr'd  By any trifling nice regard  To Sense and Honour could I reach  Thy meaning without help of speech  At the first motion of thy eye  Did not thy faithful creature fly  Have I not said not what I ought  But what my earthly Master taught  Did I e'er weigh thro' duty strong  In thy great biddings right and wrong  Did ever Int'rest to whom Thou  Can'st not with more devotion bow  Warp my sound faith or will of mine  In contradiction run to thine  Have I not at thy table plac'd  When business call'd aloud for haste  Torn myself thence yet never heard  To utter one complaining word  And had till thy great work was done  All appetites as having none  Hard is it this great plan pursu'd  Of Voluntary servitude  Pursued without or shame or fear  Thro' the great circle of the Year  Now to receive in this grand hour  Commands which lie beyond my pow'r  Commands which baffle all my skill  And leave me nothing but my will  Be that accepted let my Lord  Indulgence to his slave afford  This Task for my poor strength unfit  Will yield to none but DULLMAN's wit  With such gross incense gratified  And turning up the lip of pride  Poor  CRAPEand shook his empty head  Poor puzzled  CRAPE wise DULLMAN said  Of judgment weak of sense confin'd  For things of lower note design'd  For things within the vulgar reach  To run  of  errands and to preach  Well hast Thou judg'd that heads like mine  Cannot want help from heads like thine  Well hast Thou judg'd thyself unmeet  Of such high argument to treat  'Twas but to try thee that I spoke  And all I said was but a joke  Nor think a joke CRAPE a disgrace  Or to my Person or my place  The wisest of the Sons of Men  Have deign'd to use them now and then  The only caution do You see  Demanded by our dignity  From common use and men exempt  Is that they may not breed contempt  Great Use they have when in the hands  Of One like me who understands  Who understands the time and place  The persons manner and the grace  Which Fools neglect so that we find  If all the requisites are join'd  From whence a perfect joke must spring  A joke's a very serious thing  But to our business my design  Which gave so rough a shock to thine  To my Capacity is made  As ready as a fraud in trade  Which like BroadCloth I can with ease  Cut out in any shape I please  Some  in my circumstance some few  Ay and those men of Genius too  Good  Men who without Love or Hate  Whether they early rise or late  With names uncrack'd and credit sound  Rise worth a hundred thousand pound  By  threadbare  ways and means would try  To bear their pointso will not I  New methods shall my wisdom find  To suit these matters to my mind  So that the Infidels at Court  Who make our City Wits their sport  Shall hail the honours of my reign  And own that DULLMAN bears a brain  Some  in my place to gain their ends  Would give relations up and friends  Would lend a wife who they might swear  Safely was none the worse for wear  Would see a Daughter yet a maid  Into a Statesman's arms betray'd  Nay should the Girl prove coy nor know  What Daughters to a Father owe  Sooner than schemes so nobly plann'd  Should fail themselves would lend a hand  Would vote on one side whilst a brother  Properly taught would vote on t'other  Would ev'ry petty band forget  To public eye be with  one  set  In private with a  second  herd  And be by Proxy with a  third    Would like a  Queen  of whom I read  The other dayher name is fled  In a book where together bound  WHTTINGTON and his CAT I found  A tale most true and free from art  Which all LORDMAYORS should have by heart  A  Queen  O might those days begin  Afresh when Queens would learn to spin  Who wrought and wrought but for some plot  The cause of which I've now forgot  During the absence of the Sun  Undid what She by day had done  Whilst they a double visage wear  What's sworn by Day by Night unswear  Such be their Arts and such perchance  May happily their ends advance  From a new system  mine  shall spring  A LOCUMTENENS is the thing  That's your true Planto obligate  The present Ministers of State  My  Shadow  shall our Court approach  And bear my pow'r and have my  coach    My  fine StateCoach  superb to view  A fine StateCoach  and paid for too  To curry favour and the grace  Obtain of those who're out of place  In the mean time  I  that's to say  I  proper  I  myself  here  stay  But holdperhaps unto the Nation  Who hate the Scot's administration  To lend my Coach may seem to be  Declaring for the Ministry  For where the CityCoach is there  Is the true essence of the MAYOR  Therefore for wise men are intent  Evils at distance to prevent  Whilst Fools the evils first endure  And then are plagu'd to seek a cure  No  Coach  a  Horse  and free from fear  To make our  Deputy  appear  Fast on his back shall he be tied  With two grooms marching by his side  Then for a  Horse  thro' all the land  To head our solemn Cityband  Can any one so fit be found  As He who in  Artill'ryground    Without a Rider noble Sight  Led on our bravest troops to fight  But first CRAPE for my Honour's sake  A tender point enquiry make  About that  Horse  if the dispute  Is ended or is still in suit  For whilst a cause observe this plan  Of Justice whether  Horse  or  Man  The parties be remains in doubt  Till 'tis determin'd out and out  That Pow'r must tyranny appear  Which should  Prejudging  interfere  And weak faint Judges overawe  To biass the free course of Law  You have my willnow quickly run  And take care that my will be done  In public CRAPE You must appear  Whilst I in privacy sit here  Here shall great DULLMAN sit alone  Making this ElbowChair my throne  And You performing what I bid  Do all as if I nothing did  CRAPE heard and speeded on his way  With him to hear was to obey  Not without trouble be assur'd  A proper Proxy was procur'd  To serve such infamous intent  And such a Lord to represent  Nor could one have been found at all  On t'other side of

Fingal    Custom and Custom's all in all  Commands that we should have regard  On all high seasons to the  Bard    Great acts like these by vulgar tongue  Profan'd should not be said but sung  This place to fill renown'd in fame  The high and mighty LOCKMAN came  And ne'er forgot in DULLMAN's reign  With proper order to maintain  The  Uniformity  of Pride  Brought  Brother  WHITEHEAD by his side  On Horse who proudly paw'd the ground  And cast his fiery eyeballs round  Snorting and champing the rude bit  As if for warlike purpose fit  His high and gen'rous blood disdain'd  To be for sports and pastimes rein'd  Great DYMOCK in his glorious station  Paraded at the Coronation  Not so our  City  DYMOCK came  Heavy dispirited and tame  No mark of sense his eyes halfclos'd  He on a mighty  Drayhorse  doz'd  Fate never could a horse provide  So fit for such a man to ride  Nor find a Man with strictest care  So fit for such a horse to bear  Hung round with instruments of death  The sight of him would stop the breath  Of braggart Cowardice and make  The very  CourtDrawcansir  quake  With  Durks  which in the hands of Spite  Do their damn'd business in the Night  From  Scotland  sent but here display'd  Only to fill up the Parade  With  Swords  unflesh'd of maiden hue  Which Rage or Valour never drew  With  Blunderbusses  taught to ride  Like  PocketPistols  by his side  In girdle stuck he seem'd to be  A little moving  Armory    One thing much wanting to complete  The sight and make a perfect treat  Was that the Horse a Courtesy  In Horses found of high degree  Instead of going  forward  on  All the way  backward  should have gone  Horses  unless they breeding lack  Some Scruple make to turn their back  Tho' Riders which plain Truth declares  No scruple make of Turning

Liberty which well he knows  On the great stock of slav'ry grows  Like Sparrow who depriv'd of Mate  Snatch'd by the cruel hand of Fate  From spray to spray no more will hop  But sits alone on the Housetop  Or like Himself when all alone  At  Croydon  he was heard to groan  Lifting  both  hands in the defence  Of Interest and CommonSense  Both  hands for as no other man  Adopted and pursu'd his plan  The  Left  hand had been lonesome quite  If He had not held up the  right    Apart He came and fix'd his eyes  With rapture on a distant prize  On which in Letters worthy note  There TWENTY

But PERRY CUST may take his oath  In plain and decent garb array'd  With the prim Quaker FRAUD came TRADE  CONNIVANCE to improve the plan  Habited like a  Juryman    Judging as Interest prevails  Came

Horror bestrode a  foreign  blast  And from the  prison  of the  North    To FREEDOM deadly Storms burst forth  A  Car  like those in which we're told  Our wild Forefathers warr'd of old  Loaded with Death six Horses bear  Thro' the blank region of the air  Too fierce for time or art to tame  They pour'd forth mingled smoke and flame  From their wide Nostrils ev'ry Steed  Was of that ancient

rage which springs  From a false zeal for holy things  Wearing such robes as Prophets wear  False Prophets plac'd in PETER's chair  On which in Characters of fire  Shapes Antic horrible and dire  Inwoven flam'd where to the view  In groups appear'd a rabble crew  Of Sainted Devils where all round  Vile  Reliques  of vile men were found  Who worse than Devils from the birth  Perform'd the work

her face all o'er  Foully besmear'd with human gore  O'er heaps of mangled  Saints  She rode  Fast at her heels DEATH proudly strode  And grimly smil'd wellpleas'd to see  Such havock of mortality  Close by her side on mischief bent  And urging on each bad intent  To its full bearing Savage Wild  The Mother fit of such a child  Striving the empire to advance  Of Sin and Death came IGNORANCE  With looks where dread command was plac'd  And Sov'reign Pow'r by Pride disgrac'd  Where loudly witnessing a mind  Of savage more than human kind  Not chusing to be lov'd but fear'd  Mocking at right MISRULE appear'd  With Eyeballs glaring fiery red  Enough to strike beholders dead  Gnashing his teeth and in a flood  Pouring corruption forth and blood  From his chaf'd jaws without remorse  Whipping and spurring on his horse  Whose sides in their own blood embay'd  E'en to the bone were open laid  Came TYRANNY disdaining awe  And trampling over  Sense  and  Law    One thing and only one He knew  One object only would pursue  Tho' Less so low doth Passion bring  Than man he would be more than King  With ev'ry argument and art  Which might corrupt the head and heart  Soothing the frenzy of his mind  Companion meet was FLATT'RY join'd  Winning his carriage ev'ry look  Employ'd whilst it conceal'd a hook  When simple most most to be fear'd  Most crafty when no craft appear'd  His tales no man like him could tell  His words which melted as they fell  Might e'en a Hypocrite deceive  And make an infidel believe  Wantonly cheating o'er and o'er  Those who had cheated been before  Such FLATT'RY came in evil hour  Pois'ning the royal ear of pow'r  And grown by  Prostitution  great  Would be first Minister of State  Within the Chariot all alone  High seated on a kind of throne  With pebbles grac'd a Figure came  Whom Justice would but dare not name  Hard times when Justice without fear  Dare not bring forth to public ear  The names of those who dare offend  'Gainst Justice and pervert her end  But if the Muse afford me grace  Description shall supply the place  In  foreign  garments he was clad  Sage  Ermine o'er the glossy  Plaid  Cast rev'rend honour on his heart  Wrought by the curious hand of Art  In silver wrought and brighter far  Than heav'nly or than earthly Star  Shone a  White Rose  the Emblem dear  Of him He ever must revere  Of that dread Lord who with his host  Of faithful native rebels lost  Like those black Spirits doom'd to hell  At once from pow'r and virtue fell  Around his clouded brows was plac'd  A  Bonnet  most superbly grac'd  With mighty  Thistles  nor forgot  The sacred motto  Touch me not    In the righthand a sword He bore  Harder than Adamant and more  Fatal than winds which from the mouth  Of the rough North invade the South  The reeking blade to view presents  The blood of helpless Innocents  And on the hilt as meek become  As Lambs before the Shearers dumb  With downcast eye and solemn show  Of deep unutterable woe  Mourning the time when FREEDOM reign'd  Fast to a rock was Justice chain'd  In his lefthand in wax imprest  With bells and gewgaws idly drest  An  Image  cast in baby mould  He held and seem'd o'erjoy'd to hold  On this he fix'd his eyes to this  Bowing he gave the loyal kiss  And for Rebellion fully ripe  Seem'd to desire the ANTITYPE  What if to that  Pretender  's foes  His greatness nay his life he owes  Shall common obligations bind  And shake his constancy of mind  Scorning such weak and petty chains  Faithful to JAMES he still remains  Tho' he the friend of GEORGE appear  Dissimulation's Virtue here  Jealous and Mean he with a frown  Would awe and keep all merit down  Nor would to Truth and Justice bend  Unless  outbullied  by his  friend    Brave with the Coward with the brave  He is himself a Coward slave  Aw'd by his fears he has no heart  To take a great and open part  Mines in a subtle train he springs  And secret saps the ears of Kings  But not e'en there continues firm  'Gainst the resistance of a worm  Born in a Country  where the will  Of One is Law to all  he still  Retain'd th' infection with full aim  To spread it wheresoe'er he came  Freedom  he hated  Law  defied  The Prostitute of Pow'r and Pride  Law  he with ease explains away  And leads bewilder'd Sense astray  Much to the credit of his brain  Puzzles the cause he can't maintain  Proceeds on most familiar grounds  And where he can't convince confounds  Talents of rarest stamp and size  To Nature false he misapplies  And turns to poison what was sent  For purposes of nourishment  Paleness  not such as on his wings  The Messenger of Sickness brings  But such as takes its coward rise  From conscious baseness conscious vice  O'erspread his cheeks  Disdain  and  Pride    To upstart Fortunes ever tied  Scowl'd on his brow within his eye  Insidious lurking like a spy  To Caution principled by Fear  Not daring open to appear  Lodg'd covert  Mischief Passion  hung  On his lip quiv'ring on his tongue  Fraud  dwelt at large within his breast  All that makes Villain found a nest  All that on hell's completest plan  E're join'd to damn the heart of man  Soon as the Car reach'd land He rose  And with a look which might have froze  The heart's best blood which was enough  Had hearts been made of sterner stuff  In Cities than elsewhere to make  The very stoutest quail and quake  He cast his baleful eyes around  Fix'd without motion to the ground  Fear waiting on surprize All stood  And Horror chill'd their curdled blood  No more they thought of  Pomp  no more  For they had seen his face before  Of  Law  they thought the cause forgot  Whether it was or Ghost or Plot  Which drew them there They All stood more  Like Statues than they were before  What could be done Could Art could Force  Or Both direct a proper course  To make this savage Monster tame  Or send him back the way he came  What neither Art nor Force nor Both  Could do a  Lord  of foreign growth  A Lord  to that base wretch allied  In Country not in Vice and Pride  Effected from the selfsame land  Bad news for our blaspheming band  Of Scribblers but deserving note  The Poison came and Antidote  Abash'd the Monster hung his head  And like an empty Vision fled  His Train like Virgin Snows which run  Kiss'd by the burning bawdy Sun  To lovesick streams dissolv'd in Air  JOY who from absence seem'd more fair  Came smiling freed from slavish awe  LOYALTY LIBERTY and LAW  Impatient of the galling chain  And Yoke of pow'r resum'd their reign  And burning with the glorious flame  Of Public Virtue MANSFIELD came  FINIS
