year A commodious habitation was engaged in PRESCOT STREET by the promoters of this benevolent institution and the house was opened on the tenth of August when eight unhappy objects were admitted  In the year the Charity was removed to a more spacious building in ST GEORGE'S FIELDS  THE MAGDALENS  SEE to yon fane the suppliant Nymphs repair  At Virtue's shrine to breathe Contrition's sigh  Their youthful cheek is pal'd with early care  And sorrow dwells in their dejected eye  Hark they awake a solemn plaintive lay  Where Grief with Harmony delights to meet  Not Philomela from her lonely spray  Trills her clear note more querulously sweet  Are these the fair late Pleasure's Festive quire  Who wont the dome of Luxury to tread  Who deck'd in varying fashion's new attire  Still vied in splendor with the highborn Maid  For sober weeds they change their flowing train  Of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm  Conceal the breast that glow'd in ev'ry vein  And madden'd into joy at Love's alarm  Ah now no more the diamond's dazzling ray  Darts from the artful mazes of the hair  No more those tresses garishly display  The idle plumes that sportive mock'd the air  Yet Beauty lingers on their mournful brow  As loth to leave the cheek suffus'd with tears  Which scarcely blushing with a languid glow  Like Morn's faint beam thro' gath'ring mist appears  No more compare them to the gaudy flow'r  Whose painted foliage wantons in the gale  They look the lily drooping from the show'r  Or the pale violet sick'ning in the vale  If fond of empire and of conquest vain  They frequent vot'ries to their altars drew  Yet blaz'd those dazz'ling altars to their bane  The idol they and they the victim too  Once destitute of counsel aid or food  Some helpless orphans in this dome reside  Who like the wand'ring children in the wood  Trod the rude paths of life without a guide  Some who encircled by the great and rich  Were won by wiles and deepdesigning art  By splendid bribes and soft persuasive speech  Of pow'r to cheat the young unguarded heart  Some on whom Beauty breath'd her radiant bloom  While adverse stars all other gifts remov'd  Who hurried from the dungeon's living tomb  To scenes their inborn virtue disapprov'd  What tho' their youth imbib'd an early stain  A second innocence is now their claim  While in the precincts of this blesss'd domain  They bask beneath the rays of rising Fame  So the young myrtles in Misfortune's day  Nipt by the blast that swept their vernal bed  In shelt'ring walls their tender leaves display  And wak'ning into life new fragrance shed  Tho' whitewing'd Peace protect this calm abode  Tho' each tumultuous passion be suppress'd  Still Recollection wears a sting to goad  Still Conscience wakes to rob their soul of rest  See one the tort'ring hour of mem'ry prove  Who wrapt in pensive secrecy forlorn  Sits musing on the pledges of her love  Who fell the victims of paternal scorn  Forgot deserted in th' extremeft need  By him who shou'd have rear'd their tender age  'Was this Seducer this the promis'd meed'  She criesthen finks beneath Affliction's rage  Her busy mind recalls the fatal plain  Which with slow lab'ring steps she journey'd o'er  Halfyielding to the fierce impetuous rain  While in her arms two helpless babes she bore  Her mind recalls how at that awful hour  The dismal Owlet scream'd her shiv'ring note  How shriek'd the Spirit from the haunted tow'r  While other sounds of woe were heard remote  How to the covert of a tott'ring shed  As Night advanc'd she fearfully retir'd  And as around the dark'ning horror spread  Her famish'd infants on her breast expir'd  How keenest Anguish bade her bosom bleed  As there she brooded o'er her hapless state  'Was this Seducer this the promis'd meed'  She criesthen sinks beneath Affliction's weight  Another mourns her fall with grief sincere  Whom tranquil Reason tells she's shun'd disdain's  Repuls'd as vile by those who held her dear  Who call'd her once Companion Sister Friend  That recollects the day when lost to shame  She fondly sacrific'd her vestal charms  Resign'd the virgin's for an harlot's name  And left a parent's for a spoiler's arms  Imagination pictures to her mind  The father's rage the mother's softer woe  Unhappy pair to that distress consign'd  A child can give a parent only know  At this deep scene by Fancy drawn imprefs'd  The filial passions in her heart revive  Reproach vindictive rushes on her breast  To Nature's pangs too feelingly alive  If this or similar tormenting thought  Cling to their soul when pensively alone  For youth's offence for Love's alluring fault  Say do they not sufficiently atone  Nor deem me one of Melancholy's train  If anxious for the sorrowwedded Fair  Tho' little skilful of that heav'nly strain  Whose melting numbers to the heart repair  I steal impatient from the idle throng  The roving gay companions of my age  This poem was first published in  To temper with their praise my artless song  And softey'd Pity in their cause engage  'Tis Virtue's task to soothe Affliction's smart  To join in sadness with the Fair distrest  Wake to another's pain the tender heart  And urge to clemency the rigid breast  YARICO  to  INKLE  ADVERTISEMENT  INKLE is preparing to set out for England after having sold YARICO to a merchant at Barbadoes 'notwithstanding 'that the poor Girl says the Spectator 'to incline him to commiserate her condition 'told him that she was with child by him but he 'only made use of that information to rise in his 'demands upon the purchaser'  YARICO to INKLE  WITH falsehood lurking in thy sordid breast  And perj'ry's seal upon thy heart imprest  Dar'st thou Oh Christian brave the sounding waves  The treach'rous whirlwinds and untrophied graves  Regardless of my woes securely go  No cursesraught accents from these lips shall flow  My fondest wish shall catch thy flying sail  Attend thy course and urge the fav'ring gale  May ev'ry bliss thy God confers be thine  And all thy share of woe compris'd in mine  One humble boon is all I now implore  Allow these feet to print their kindred shore  Give me Oh Albion's son again to roam  For thee deserted my delightful home  To view the groves that deck my native scene  The limpid stream that graceful glides between  Retrieve the fame I spurn'd at Love's decree  Ascend the throne which I forsook for thee  Approach the bow'rwhy starts th'unbidden tear  Where once thy YARICO to thee was dear  The scenes the hand of Time has thrown behind  Return impetuous to my busy mind  'What hostile vessel quits the roaring tide  'To harbour here its tempestbeaten side  'Behold the beach receives the shipwreck'd crew  'Oh mark their strange attire and pallid hue  'Are these the Christians restless sons of pride  'By avarice nurtur'd to deceit allied  'Who tread with cunning step the maze of art  'And mask with placid looks a canker'd heart  'Yet note superior to the num'rous throng  'E'en as the citron humbler plants among  'That YouthLo beauty on his graceful brow  'With nameless charms bids ev'ry feature glow  'Ah leave fair stranger this unsocial ground  'Where danger broods and fury stalks around  'Behold thy foes advancemy steps pursue  'To where I'll screen thee from their fatal view  'He comes he comes th' ambrosial feast prepare  The fig the palmjuice nor th' anana spare  In spacious canisters nor fail to bring  The scented foliage of the blushing spring  Ye graceful handmaids dress the roseat bow'r  And hail with music this auspicious hour  Ah no forbearbe ev'ry lyre unstrung  More pleasing music warbles from his tongue  Yet utter not to me the lover's vow  All all is thine that Friendship can bestow  'Our laws my station check the guilty flame  'Why was I born ye powers a Nubian dame  'Yet see around at Love's enchanting call  'Stern laws submit and vain distinctions fall  'And mortals then enjoy life's transient day  'When smit with passion they indulge the sway  'Yes crown'd with bliss we'll roam the conscious grove  'And drink long draughts of unexhausted love  'Nor joys alone thy dangers too I'll share  'With thee the menace of the waves I'll dare  'In vainfor smiles his brow deep frowns involve  'The sacred ties of Gratitude dissolve  'See Faith distracted rends her comely hair  'His fading vow's while tainted zephyrs bear'  Oh thou before whose seraphguarded throne  The Christians bow and other Gods disown  If wrapt in darkness thou deny'st thy ray  And shround'st from NUBIA thy celestial day  Indulge this fervent pray'r to thee address'd  Indulge tho' utter'd from a sable breast  May gath'ring storms eclipse the chearful skies  And mad'ning furies from thy hell arise  With glaring torches meet his impious brow  And drag him howling to the gulf below  Ah no May Heav'n's bright messengers descend  Obey his call his ev'ry wish attend  Still o'er his form their hov'ring wings display  If he be blest these pangs admit allay  Me still her mark let angry Fortune deem  So thou may'st walk beneath her cloudless beam  Yet oft to my rapt ear didst thou repeat  That I suffic'd to frame thy bliss compleat  Deluded sex the dupes of man decreed  We splendid victims at his altar bleed  The grateful accents of thy praiseful tongue  Where artful flatt'ry too persuasive hung  Like flow'rs adorn'd the path to my disgrace  And bade Destruction wear a smiling face  Yet form'd by Nature in her choicest mould  While on thy cheek her blushing charms unfold  Who could oppose to thee stern Virtue's shield  What tender virgin would not wish to yield  But pleasure on the wings of Time was born  And I expos'd a prey to tyrant scorn  Of lowborn tradersmark the hand of fate  IS YARICO reduc'd to grace the state  Whose impious parents an advent'rous band  Imbru'd with guiltless blood my native land  E'en snatch'd my father from his regal seat  And stretch'd him breathless at their hostile feet  Illfated prince The Christians sought thy shore  Unsheath'd the sword and mercy was no more  But thou fair stranger cam'st with gentler mind  To shun the perils of the wrecking wind  Amidst thy foes thy safety still I plan'd  And reach'd for galling chains the myrtle band  Nor then unconscious of the secret fire  Each heart voluptuous throb'd with warm desire  Ah pleasing youth kind object of my care  Companion Friend and ev'ry name that's dear  Say from thy mind canst thou so soon remove  The records graven by the hand of Love  How as we wanton'd on the flow'ry ground  The looserob'd pleasures danc'd unblam'd around  Till to the sight the growing burden prov'd  How thou o'ercam'stand how alas I lov'd  Too fatal proof since thou with av'rice fraught  Didst basely urge ah shun the wounding thought  That tender circumstancereveal it not  Lest torn with rage I curse my fated lot  Lest startled Reason abdicate her reign  And Madness revel in this heated brain  That tender circumstanceinhuman part  I will not weep tho' serpents gnaw this heart  Frail frail resolve while gushing from mine eye  The pearly drops these boastful words belie  Alas can Sorrow in this bosom sleep  Where strikes Ingratitude her talons deep  When he whom still I love to Nature dead  Stabs Pleasure as she mounts the nuptial bed  What time his guardian pow'r I most requir'd  Against my fame and happiness conspir'd  And do I live to breathe the barb'rous tale  His faithful YARICO expos'd to sale  Yes basely urg'd regardless of my pray'rs  E'en while I bath'd his venal hand with tears  The tend'rest circumstanceI can no more  My future childto swell his impious store  All all mankind for this will rise thy foe  But I alas alone endure the woe  Endure what healing balms can ne'er controul  The heartlodg'd stings and agony of soul  Was it for this I left my native plain  And dar'd the tempest brooding on the main  For this unlock'd seduc'd by Christian art  The chaste affections of my virgin heart  Within this bosom san'd the constant flame  And fondly languish'd for a Mother's name  Lo ev'ry hope is poison'd in its bloom  And horrors watch around this guilty womb  With blood illustrious circling thro' these veins  Which ne'er was chequer'd with plebeian stains  Thro' ancestry's long line ennobled springs  From famecrown'd warriors and exalted kings  Must I the shafts of Infamy sustain  To Slav'ry's purposes my Infant train  To catch the glances of his haughty lord  Attend obedient at the festive board  From hands unscepter'd take the scornful blow  Uproot the thoughts of glory as they grow  Let this pervade at length thy heart of steel  Yet yet return nor blush oh man to feel  Ah guide thy steps from yon expecting fleet  Thine injur'd YARICO relenting meet  Bid her recline woestricken on thy breast  And hush her raging sorrows into rest  If Pity's voice can't wake thy torpid soul  Let Terror her impending thunder roll  'Twas nightmy solitary couch I press'd  Till sorrowworn I wearied into rest  Methoughtnor was it childish Fancy's flight  My country's Genius stood confess'd to sight  'Let Europe's sons he said enrich their shore  'With stones of lustre and barbaric ore  'Adorn their country with their splendid stealth  'Unnative foppery and gorgeous wealth  'Embellish still her form with foreign spoils  'Till like a gaudy prostitute she smiles  'The day th' avenging day at length shall rise  'And tears shall trickle from that harlot's eyes  'Her own Gods shall prepare the fatal doom  'Lodg'd in Time's pregnant and destructive womb  'The mischiefbearing womb these hands shall rend  'And straight shall issue forth Confusion's fiend'  Say ALBION youth flow all my words in vain  Like seeds that strew the rude ungrateful plain  Say shall I ne'er regain thy wonted grace  Ne'er stretch these arms to catch the wish'd embrace  Enoughwith newawak'd resentment fraught  Assist me Heav'n to tear him from my thought  No longer vainly suppliant will I bow  And give to love what I to hatred owe  Forgetful of the race from whence I came  With woe acquainted but unknown to shame  Hence vile Dejection with thy plaintive pray'r  Thy bended knee and still descending tear  Rejoin rejoin the palecomplexion'd train  The conflict's pastand I'm myself again  Thou parent Sun if e'er with pious lay  I usher'd in thy worldreviving ray  Or as thy fainter beams illum'd the west  With grateful voice I hymn'd thee to thy rest  Beheld with wond'ring eye thy radiant seat  Or sought thy sacred dome with unclad feet  If near to thy bright altars as I drew  My votive lamb thy holy Flamen slew  Forgive that I irrev'rent of thy name  Dar'd for thy foe indulge th' unhallow'd flame  E'en on a Christian lavish'd my esteem  And scorn'd the sable children of thy beam  This poniard by my daring hand imprest  Shall drink the ruddy drops that warm my breast  Nor I alone by this immortal deed  From Slav'ry's laws my infant shall be freed  And thou whose ear is deaf to Pity's call  Behold at length thy destin'd victim fall  Behold thy oncelov'd NUBIAN stain'd with gore  Unwept extended on the crimson floor  These temples clouded with the shades of death  These lips unconscious of the ling'ring breath  These eyes uprais'd ere clos'd by Fate's decree  To catch expiring one faint glimpse of thee  Ah then thy YARICO forbear to dread  My fault'ring voice no longer will upbraid  Demand due vengeance of the pow'rs above  Or more offensive still implore thy love  THE NUN OR ADALEIDA TO HER FRIEND  WITH each perfection dawning on her mind  All Beauty's treasure op'ning on her cheek  Each flatt'ring hope subdu'd each wish resign'd  Does gay OPHELIA this lone mansion seek  Say gentle maid what prompts thee to forsake  The paths thy birth and fortune strew with flow'rs  Thro' Nature's kind endearing ties to break  And waste in cloister'd walls thy pensive hours  Let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal  That guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate  Lest thy soft heart this friendship bids reveal  Like mine unblest should mourn like mine too late  Does some angelic lonelywhisp'ring voice  Some sacred impulse or some dream divine  Applaud the dictates of thy early choice  Approach with confidence the awful shrine  There kneeling at yon altar's marble base  While tears of rapture from thine eyelid steal  And smiling Heav'n illumes thy soul with grace  Pronounce the vow thou never can'st repeal  But if misled by falseentitled friends  Who saythat Peace with all her comely train  From starry regions to this clime descends  Smooths ev'ry frown and softens ev'ry pain  That vestals tread Contentment's flow'ry lawn  Approv'd of Innocence by Health carest  That rob'd in colours of the vernal dawn  Celestial Hope sits smiling at their breast  Suspect their syren song and artful style  Their pleasing sounds some treach'rous thought conceal  Full oft does pride with sainted voice beguile  And sordid int'rest wear the mask of zeal  A tyrant abbess here perchance may reign  Who fond of pow'r affects th' imperial nod  Looks down disdainful on her female train  And rules the cloister with an iron rod  Reflection sickens at the lifelong tie  Backglancing Mem'ry acts her busy part  Its charm the world unfolds to Fancy's eye  And sheds allurement on the youthful heart  Lo Discord enters at the sacred porch  Rage in her frown and terror on her crest  E'en at the hallow'd lamps she lights her torch  And holds it flaming to each virgin breast  But since the legends of monastic bliss  By fraud are fabled and by youth believ'd  Unbought experience learn from my distress  Oh mark my lot and be no more deceiv'd  Three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled  When I was torn from ev'ry weeping friend  A trembling victim to the temple led  And blush ye parents by a father's hand  Yet then what solemn scenes deceiv'd my choice  The pealing organ's animating sound  The choral virgins' captivating voice  The blazing altar and the priests around  The train of youth array'd in purest white  Who scatter'd myrtles as I pass'd along  The thousand lamps that pour'd a flood of light  The kiss of Peace from all the vestal throng  The golden censers toss'd with graceful hand  Whose fragrant breath ARABIAN odor shed  Of meekey'd novices the circling band  With blooming chaplets wreath'd around their head  My willing soul was caught in rapture's flame  While sacred ardor glow'd in ev'ry vein  Methought applauding angels sung my name  And Heav'n's unsullied glories gilt the fane  Methought in sunbeams rob'd the heav'nly spouse  Indulg'd the longings of my holy love  Not undelighted heard my virgin vows  While o'er the altar wav'd the mystic dove  This temporary transport soon expir'd  My drooping heart confess'd a dreadful void  Now helpless heav'nabandon'd uninspir'd  I tread this dome to Misery allied  No wak'ning joy informs my fullen breast  Thro' op'ning skies no radiant seraph smiles  No saint descends to foothe my soul to rest  No dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles  Here haggard Discontent still haunts my view  The umber'd genius reigns in ve'ry place  Arrays each virtue in the darkest hue  Chills ev'ry pray'r and cancels ev'ry grace  I meet her ever in the chearless cell  The gloomy grotto and the awful wood  I hear her ever in the midnight bell  The chiding gale and hoarseresounding flood  This caus'd a mother's tender tears to flow  The sad remembrance time shall ne'er erase  When having seal'd th' irrevocable vow  I hasten'd to receive her last embrace  Yet ne'er did her maternal voice unfold  This cloister'd scene in all its horror drest  Nor did she then my trembling steps withhold  When here I enter'd a reluctant guest  Ah could she viewher only child betray'd  And let submission o'er her love prevail  Th'unfeeling priest why did she not upbraid  Forbid the vow and rend the hov'ring veil  Alas she might nother relentless lord  Had seal'd her lips and chid the rising tear  So Anguish in her breast conceal'd its hoard  And all the Mother sunk in dumb despair  But thou who own'st a Father's sacred name  What act impell'd thee to this ruthless deed  What crime had forfeited my filial claim  And giv'n Oh blasting thought thy heart to bleed  If then thine injur'd child deserve thy care  Oh haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom  In vainno words can soothe his rigid ear  And iron laws have riveted my doom  Yet let me to my fate submissive bow  From fatal symptoms if I right conceive  This stream OPHELIA has not long to flow  This voice to murmur and this breast to heave  Ah when extended on th'untimely bier  To yonder vault this form shall be convey'd  Thou'lt not refuse to shed one grateful tear  And breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade  With pious footsteps join the sable train  As thro' the lengthening isle they take their way  A glimmering taper let thy hand sustain  Thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay  Behold the minister who lately gave  The sacred veil in garb of mournful hue  More friendly office bending o'er my grave  And sprinkling my remains with hallow'd dew  As o'er the corse he strews the humbling dust  The sternest heart will raise Compassion's sigh  E'en then no longer to his child unjust  The tears may trickle from a FATHER'S eye  THE NUNNERY  This Poem which was placed at the end of the volume in the former edition comes with greater propriety immediately after the NUN for as there ADALEIDA foretels her fate so is her death mentioned in the NUNNERY and marked with some peculiar circumstances which render the present Poem a supplement to the preceding one  Now pants the nightbreeze thro' the darken'd air  And Silence sooths the vestal world to rest  Save where some paleey'd novice rapt in pray'r  Heaves a deep moan and smites her guiltless breast  Within those ancient walls with moss o'erspread  Where Grief and Innocence their vigils keep  Each in her humble cell till midnight laid  The gentle daughters of Devotion sleep  Of Wantonness the pleasurebreathing lay  Or Laughter beck'ning from his rosy seat  Or Vanity attir'd in colours gay  Shall ne'er allure them from their sober state  Domestic comforts they shall never know  Nor voice of kindred reach their distant ear  Ne'er with a mother's transport shall they glow  While playful children charm the ling'ring year  The various flow'rs in many a wreath they twine  To crown the altar on some festive day  How fervent do they kiss each holy shrine  How thro' the columns streams the choral lay  Let not Ambition mock with jest profane  The life that woos Retreat's obscureft shade  Nor worldly Beauty with a sneer disdain  The humble duties of the cloister'd Maid  The glift'ning eye the halfseen breast of snow  The coral lip the blush of Nature's bloom  Awaits alike th' inexorable foe  The paths of Pleasure lead but to the tomb  Perhaps in this drear mansion are confin'd  Some bosom form'd to love unspoil'd by art  Charms that might soften the severest mind  And wake to extacy the coldest heart  Full many a riv'let wand'ring to the main  Sequester'd pours its solitary stream  Full many a lamp devoted to the fane  Sheds unregarded its nocturnal beam  Some uncrown'd MARGARET loit'ring in her cell  By Nature form'd bright Glory's course to run  Here some inglorious MOUNTAGU may dwell  Some EDITHA  Mr POPE'S Mother  unconscious of a son  From Flatt'ry's lip to drink the sweets of praise  In conscious charms with rivals still to vie  In circles to attract the partial gaze  And view their beauty in th' admirer's eye  Their lot forbids nor does alone remove  The thirst of praise but e'en their crimes restrain  Forbids thro' Folly's labyrinth to rove  And yield to Vanity the flowing rein  To rear 'mid Hymen's joys domestic strife  Or seek that converse which they ought to shun  To loose the sacred ties of nuptial life  And give to many what they vow'd to one  What tho' they're sprinkled with etherial dew  With blooming wreaths by hands of Seraphs crown'd  Tho' Heav'n's unfading splendors burst to view  And harps celestial to their ear resound  Still Recollection prompts the frequent sigh  The chearful scenes of younger days arise  Still to their native home their wishes fly  Affection's stream still gushes from their eyes  For who entranc'd in visions from above  The thought of kindred razes from the mind  Feels in the soul no warm returning love  For some endear'd companion left behind  Their joyencircled hearth as they forsook  From some fond breast reluctant they withdrew  As from the deck they sent a farewell look  Fair ALBION sunk for ever from their view  For thee who mindful of th' encloister'd train  Dost in these lines their mournful tale relate  If by Compassion guided to this fane  Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate  Haply some matronvestal may reply  "Oft have we heard him when Light's ling'ring ray  "Scarce mark'd its passage thro' the dark'ning sky  "At yonder altar join the vesperlay  "Where hapless ADALEIDA sought repose  "Oft at yon grave wou'd he her fate condole  "And in his breast as scenes of grief arose  "He saw ascending slow her spotless soul  Peace to my  EDWARD'  s heart the vision said  Ah not unseen thou shed'st that grateful tear  I wait at night to catch thy wonted tread  And thank thy faithful love that sorrows here  "One eve I miss'd him at the hour divine  "Along that isle and in the facristy  "Another came not yet beside the shrine  "Not at the font nor in the church was he  "The next we heard the bell of Death intone  "And to his grave we mov'd a mournful band  "Approach and read on this sepulchral stone  "These lines engrav'd by Friendship's holy hand"  EPITAPH  Pause o'er the Youthnor grudge the short delay  Full soon his little history is told  He gave to Solitude the pensive day  And Pity fram'd his bosom of her mould  THE DESERTER  BY others blest with genius' rays  Let noble acts be told  While I content with humbler praise  A simple tale unfold  The SPANIARD left the hostile plain  To seek his native land  Beneath the sails that swept the main  CABEYSA join'd the band  Who as he met his country's foes  Within the field of Fame  Above his rank obscure arose  And grac'd his humble name  Yet not the early wreath of Fame  With haughtiness was twin'd  Nor pride nor fickleness could claim  The empire of his mind  The lowly hut beneath whose roof  He sigh'd a sad adieu  Receiv'd him time and distanceproof  To Love and LAURA true  This hamletfair by Fortune scorn'd  Seem'd Nature's fav'rite child  With hand profuse by her adorn'd  The flowret of the wild  Her neat but homely garments press'd  The pure the feeling heart  Oft sought in vain behind the vest  Of decorated art  "If sharing all thy cares she said  "Has paled my beauty's rose  "Ah know for thee the heart that bled  "With all its passion glows  "Blest moment to my wish that gives  "The long long absent youth  "He livesth' endear'd CABEYSA lives  "And Love confirms the truth  "When thy brave comrades fell around  "What Pow'r's benignant care  "Secur'd thee from the fatal wound  "And LAURA from despair  "Oft in the troubling dream of night  "I saw the rushing spear  "Nor did the Morn's awak'ning light  "Dispel the ling'ring fear"  "Thy tender fears the youth replied  "Ah give them to the air  "To happiness we're now allied  "And pleasure be our care  "Let us pursue the joy begun  "Nor lose by dull delay  "Say LAURA shall tomorrow's sun  "Illume our nuptial day"  With look declin'd she blush'd consent  Reserve that takes alarm  And Love and Joy their influence lent  To raise meek Beauty's charm  The guests to hail the wedded pair  Beneath their roof repair'd  With them the little feast to share  Their scanty purse prepar'd  Tho' no delicious wines were pour'd  Mirth took his destin'd place  The handmaid Neatness spread the board  And sage Content said grace  Scarce thro' one hasty week had Love  His grateful blessings shed  When bliss as flies the frighted dove  Their humble mansion fled  'Twas at BELLONA'S voice it flew  That call'd to War's alarms  Bad the youth rise to valor true  And break from LAURA'S arms  But she still strain'd him to her heart  To lengthen the adieu  "Ah what she said should'st thou depart  "Shall I and Sorrow do  "Say valiant youth when thou'rt away  "Who'll raise my drooping head  "How shall I chase the fears that say  "Thy lov'd CABEYSA'S dead  "With thine my fate I now involve  "Intent thy course to steer  "No words shall shake my firm resolve  "Not e'en that trickling tear"  "Fram'd for each scene of soft delight  "He said thy gentle form  "As shrinks the lily at the blight  "Will droop beneath the storm"  "Blest in thy presence ev'ry pain  "She added brings its charm  "And Love tho' falls the beating rain  "Will keep this bosom warm"  E'en as the wallflow'r rears its head  'Mid ruins wrecks and tombs  So 'mid the woes around that spread  True Love unconquer'd blooms  Her zeal the supplement of strength  Upheld her many a day  But Nature's pow'rs subdued at length  On Sickness' couch she lay  Three painful days unseen she lay  Of him she held so dear  "Ah does he thus my love repay"  She saidand dropt a tear  "CABEYSA at a league's remove  "Dwells on the tentspread hill  "Ah wherefore did he vow true love  "And not that vow fulfil"  Yet not deficiency of truth  Forbad to yield relief  Stern pow'r withheld the tender youth  And duty to his chief  Who wisely counsel'd drew a line  To check the hand of Stealth  That ravag'd wide th'encircling vine  The humble peasant's wealth  To pass the line it was ordain'd  Whoever should presume  Should a Deserter be

puer risu cognoscere matrem  YE Fair for whom the hands of HYMEN weave  The nuptial wreath to deck your virgin brow  While pleasing pains the conscious bosom heave  And on the kindling cheek the blushes glow  Whose spotless soul contains the better dow'r  Whose life unstain'd full many virtues vouch  For whom now Venus frames the fragrant bow'r  And scatters roses o'er the destin'd couch  To you I singAh ere the raptur'd youth  With trembling hand removes the jealous veil  Where long regardless of the vows of truth  Unsocial coyness stamp'd th' ungrateful seal  Allow the poet round your flowing hair  Cull'd from an humble vale a wreath to twine  To Beauty's altar with the Loves repair  And wake the lute beside that living shrine  That sacred shrine where female virtue glows  To which retreat the warm affections fly  Where Love is born where strong attachment grows  Where frames pure Constancy the faithful tye  That shrine where Nature with presaging aim  What time her friendly aid LUCINA brings  The snowy nectar pours delightful stream  Where flutt'ring Cupids dip their purple wings  For you who bear a Mother's sacred name  Whose cradled offspring in lamenting strain  With artless eloquence afferts his claim  The boon of Nature but asserts in vain  Say why illustrious daughters of the Great  Lives not the nursling at your tender breast  By you protected in his frail estate  By you attended and by you caress'd  To venal hands alas can you resign  The Parent's task the Mother's pleasing care  To venal hands the smiling babe consign  While HYMEN starts and Nature drops a tear  When 'mid the polish'd circle ye rejoice  Or roving join fantastic Pleasure's train  Unheard perchance the nursting lifts his voice  His tears unnotic'd and unsooth'd his pain  Ah what avails the coral crown'd with gold  In heedless infancy the title vain  The colours gay the purfled scarfs unfold  The splendid nurs'ry and th' attendant train  Far better hadst thou first beheld the light  Beneath the rafter of some roof obscure  There in a Mother's eye to read delight  And in her cradling arm repose secure  Nor wonder should HYGEIA blissful Queen  Her wonted salutary gifts recall  While haggard Pain applies his dagger keen  And o'er the cradle Death unfolds his pall  The flow'ret ravish'd from its native air  And bid to flourish in a foreign vale  Does it not oft elude the planter's care  And breathe its dying odors on the gale  For you ye plighted fair when Hymen crowns  With tender offspring your unshaken love  Behold them not with Rigor's chilling frowns  Nor from your sight unfeelingly remove  Unsway'd by Fashion's dull unseemly jest  Still to the bosom let your infant cling  There banquet oft an everwelcome guest  Unblam'd inebriate at that healthful spring  With fond solicitude each pain assuage  Explain the look awake the ready smile  Unfeign'd attachment so shall you engage  To crown with gratitude maternal toil  So shall your daughters in Affliction's day  When o'er your form the gloom of age shall spread  With lenient converse chase the hours away  And smooth with Duty's hand the widow'd bed  Approach compassionate the voice of Grief  And whisper patience to the closing ear  From Comfort's chalice minister relief  And in the potion drop a silial tear  So shall your sons when beauty's charms are fled  When fades the languid lustre in your eye  When Flattery shuns her Hybladrops to shed  The want of beauty and of praise supply  E'en from the wreath that decks the warrior's brow  Some chosen leaves your peaceful walks shall strew  And e'en the flow'rs on classic ground that blow  Shall all unfold their choicest sweets for you  When to th' embattled host the trumpet blows  While at the call fair ALBION'S gallant train  Dare to the field their triplenumber'd foes  And chase them speeding o'er the martial plain  The mother kindles at the glorious thought  And to her son's renown adjoins her name  For at the nurt'ring breast the  Hero  caught  The love of Virtue and the love of Fame  Or in the senate when Britannia's cause  With gen'rous themes inspires the glowing mind  While list'ning Freedom grateful looks applause  Pale Slav'ry drops her chain and sculks behind  With conscious joy the tender parent fraught  Still to her son's renown adjoins her name  For at the nurt'ring breast the  Patriot  caught  The love of Virtue and the love of Fame  Yet then ascending still with bolder view  Should the blest youth to heav'nly gists aspire  While with keen eye he pierces nature through  And his proud bosom owns a Muse of fire  The Mother yields to Glory's soaring thought  And darts of thrilling transport touch her frame  For at the nurt'ring breast the  Poet  caught  The love of Virtue and the love of Fame  MATILDA

languishingly lay reclin'd  Here Beauty undefil'd by art  Whose bosom own'd a tender heart  Beneath the sails from home remov'd  And trusted to the man she lov'd  A soothing calmness lull'd the deep  And hush'd each wavy surge to sleep  The air along the sultry day  Scorch'd by the summer's fervent ray  Was freshen'd by a recent show'r  While silence solemniz'd the hour  The still solemnity impress'd  With awful thoughts CAMILLA'S breast  For now by prompting Love impell'd  Now by Timidity withheld  The words she to her lips applied  Recoil'd and unaccented died  PLACENTIO too alike

the rest of the time was devoted to the occupations of the fair to merriment and festivity  See BOURNE's Antiquities of the Common People with Observations by Mr BRAND  The merchants who frequented the fairs in numerous caravans or companies employed every art to draw the people together They were therefore accompanied by jugglers minstrels and buffoons  WARTON'S History of English Poetry vol ii p  THE ANCIENT ENGLISH WAKE  HARK how the merry merry bells resound  To summon to the Wake the hamlets round  The villagers in all their best array  Go forth to celebrate the festive day  Now from the moatencircled castle came  An aged Chief who grac'd the roll of Fame  Who knows not  A celebrated character in the reign of HENRY the Third  CHESTER'S Earl to worth ally'd  The boast of chivalry and valour's pride  From courts and busy camps at length retir'd  To deeds of Fame no longer he aspir'd  Pleas'd far sequester'd from the voice of praise  To give to peace his last remaining days  And while life's hourglass near its period stands  To watch and pray beside the closing sands  But 'mid the stillness of retirement's shade  Domestic sorrow on his bosom prey'd  A Daughter fram'd his favor to engage  Pride of his house and soother of his age  Her native mansion had abruptly fled  The veil of darkness o'er the rest was spread  Oft of his child some welcome news to gain  The tortur'd Father sought but sought in vain  He strives this day his sorrows to beguile  And hide his anguish with a sickly smile  The hoary Pastor near the villagefane  Receiv'd the honour'd Chief and all his train  This holy meek disinterested man  Had form'd his useful life on duty's plan  Unpractis'd in those arts that teach to rise  The vacant mitre ne'er allur'd his eyes  Regardless still of dissipation's call  He seldom tarried at the festive hall  Where all around the storied texture hung  Where psaltries sounded and where minstrels sung  But to the humble cot's neglected door  The sacred man the balm of comfort bore  Still would he listen to the injur'd swain  For he who listens mitigates the pain  There was he seen reclining o'er the bed  Where the pale maiden bow'd her anguish'd head  Where reft of hope the yielding victim lay  And like a wreath of snow dissolv'd away  With feeling soul the Pastor oft enquir'd  Where the meek train of silent grief retir'd  Shame that declines her sorrows to impart  The drooping spirit and the broken heart  He ne'er the friar's gaping wallet fed  But to the widow sent his loaf of bread  His fee to ROME reluctantly he paid  And call'd the Pardoner's a pilf'ring trade  The sacred Psalter well he knew to gloss  And on its page illuminate the cross  The written Missal on the altar seen  Inclos'd in velvet of the richest green  Display'd initials by his fancy plann'd  Whose brilliant colours own'd his skilful hand  This gailyletter'd book his art devis'd  The temple's only ornament compriz'd  The hallow'd service of this modest fane  Far from the splendor of a choral train  Could boast no labour'd chant no solemn rites  No clouds of incense and no pomp of lights  But at the plain and lowly altar stands  The villagepriest with pure uplifted hands  Invoking from above Heav'n's guardian care  In all the meek simplicity of pray'r  Fam'd CHESTER now returning from the fane  Surveys the tents gayspreading o'er the plain  Beneath whose roof the merchantband display'd  The cheerful scenery of active trade  While some intent on wealth with sober view  The graver purport of the fair pursue  Some of a free and roving mind partake  The various callings of the busy Wake  These urge the prescient seer deepvers'd in fate  Some passage of their story to relate  There the fond maid solicitous to know  Some future instance of her joy or woe  Attends half unbelieving half sincere  To the vague dictates of the artful Seer  Lo where the trader all his art employs  To rear the pageantry of  holy  toys  And on the simple rustics shed the glare  Of gaudy Superstition's lighter ware  Here beads hung round in many a splendid row  In crystal glitter or in coral glow  Here gaylypainted saints attract the sight  There ivory crosses of the purest white  Here brilliant pebbles from the hallow'd well  In which are lodg'd the wonderworking spell  Some by the travell'd pilgrim take their stand  To hear the wonders of a foreign strand  While others smitten with the love of song  Around the minstrel's harp attentive throng  Of war and daring chiefs the master sung  While from the chords terrific founds he flung  At length descending from his lofty mood  The feeling bard a milder theme pursued  And gently wak'd those soft complaining tones  So dear to melody which Scotland owns  Though the Scottish music as we now have it is attributed to JAMES the First of Scotland yet as most of the harpers were supporsed to have come from the North it is very probable that there was something alluring and characteristic in the northern music previous to that period and which partook of the style that reigns in the compositions of JAMES the First and which TASSONI calls  Musica lamentevole e mesta differente da tutte l'altre  Now when the thronging audience all withdrew  A beauteous Maiden still remain'd in view  She seem'd as one of the dejected kind  Whose face betrays the secret of the mind  She look'd as opening day scarce ting'd with light  Or summer's eve when fading into night  She spoke'Sweet are the songs from Scotland's coast  'They they admire them best who feel them most  'Abrupt pathetic airs devoid of art  'That breathe upon the soul and melt the heart  'Still when the bard some mournful tale records  'With plaintive harmony they clothe his words  'Ah then they witness to the ear of grief  'That food to sorrow is the best relief  'Bend gen'rous minstrel to a mourner's pray'r  'Sooth with thy art the ills I'm doom'd to bear  'Still let some Highland airs thy skill employ  'And steep my soul in melancholy joy'  Attentive to the tuneful Maid's request  With magic touch the weeping harp he press'd  And waken'd into life that pow'rful strain  Whose sound persuasive charms almost to pain  That thrilling harmony to nature true  Whose arrows only wound the sacred few  See now the throng in clust'ring numbers go  To where the troop display'd the gaudy show  DR WARTON observes in his History of English Poetry that the subject of this sort of spectacle was till the reign of HENRY the Seventh confined to moral allegory or to religion blended with buffoonery    They first presented to th' expecting view  Amid encircling clouds of richest hue  Religion on a throne exalted high  While flow'rs fell sprinkling from the mimic sky  Now stately ent'ring on the splendid scene  Array'd in white three female forms were seen  These female figures to th' admiring crowd  The names of Faith of Hope of Love avow'd  Three rivals they appear before the throne  To pleadand make their various merit known  Faith while a sable band o'erspread her eyes  In accents to this purport claim'd the prize  'Foe to the prying search of shallow wit  'Thy sacred lore unquestion'd I admit  'Before the dazzling splendor of the Law  'I close my view and bend with trembling awe'  Hope with an air to confidence ally'd  Advanc'dher symbol leaning at her side  'The sea of life do wrecking winds deform  'Borne on a plank I smile amidst the storm  'Still thro' the dark'ning show'rs that intervene  'With piercing view I mark the promis'd scene  'Where lift'ning to the ocean's distant roar  'Delight sits harbour'd near the frgrant shore'  Next Charity with looks that dwelt on high  Her soul ecstatic beaming from her eye  Began'No fond expectancies I frame  'I boast no merit no reward I claim  'While Heav'n's creative pow'r around me flows  'The flame of love within my bosom glows  'Rais'd from the nature of a senseless clod  'I burn with gratitude and thank my God  'I feel I feel affection's piercing dart'  She paus'd and laid her hand upon her heart  A dovelike form now sailing from the skies  Bore in her beak the flow'rinwoven prize  Religion reach'd it from the hov'ring dove  And twin'd the wreath around the brow of Love  Now other actors mute attention claim  Whose antic gestures mark'd a lighter aim  A troop of busy mutt'ring friars press'd  Around a lawman by the fiend possest  The meagre Exorcist now plies his part  Acts all the wonders of his secret art  Nor word of magic pray'r nor rite avails  The whole artillery of the Father fails  At length he sportive cries 'Still uncontroul'd  'No pow'r can wrest sly Satan from his hold  'Here end we then this ineffectual strife  'A lawyer's bosom is a place for life'  The baffled Exorcist now quits his ground  While peals of simple laughter burst around  See to the tents the villagers repair  The solace of the temp'rate feast to share  A gay pavilion that adorn'd the plain  Receiv'd timehonour'd CHESTER and his train  'Twas then a Maid whose cheek wore beauty's hue  Clad as a pilgrim rush'd upon their view  And said while at the Warrior's feet she fell  'This lowly attitude becomes me well  'Nor will I ever raise my blushing face  'Till my lov'd Father shall pronounce my grace'  'Lost AGATHA' th' astonished CHESTER cries  'Lost AGATHA' each glad'ning guest replies  'Tell tell me fugitive' the Father said  'Before my blessing on thy soul I shed  'Dost thou return with all thy bloom of name  'And all the wonted fragrance of thy fame  'If soil'd by vice in some unhappy hour  'Thy character has lost its boasted flow'r  'Away awayfar from my sight retire  'Nor dare rash girl to meet thy wrathful Sire'  With injur'd look and blushembellish'd cheek  The beauteous AGATHA began to speak  'Proud of my ancestry our honor'd name  'Shall ne'er thro' me receive the blast of shame  'Pure as the lily drooping with the dew  'Heav'n is my judge I now approach thy view'  'Then with a Father's wonted glow I burn  'My fond affections all to three return  'Thy look thy words thy tears each doubt efface'  He saidand lock'd her in his close embrace  At length he urg'd his daughter to recite  The dark mysterious purport of her flight  In act to speak advanc'd the beauteous Fair  And drew attention still as midnight air  She sigh'dthe roses on her cheek grew pale  While expectation panted for the tale  'Recall' she said 'that brilliant hour recall  'When first RODOLPHUS grac'd the festive hall  'Adorn'd with Valor's wreath in early fame  'In flow'r of youth in beauty's pride he came  'The blush of diffidence was on his brow  'When in soft voice he spoke the ardent vow  'Oh kind oh generous Sire thy friendly voice  'Approv'd the Youth and sanctified my choice  'To his affection as I nearer drew  'Encreasing merit open'd on my view  'When he discours'd till then to me unknown  'I breath'd the sigh that sorrow does not own  'Regardless of the throng when he was by  'Still linger'd on his form my lovesick eye  'Still did each moment some new charm disclose  'As brings each gale new fragrance from the rose  'Oh tender Sire thou nam'dst the nuptial hour  'And grac'd thy daughter with a regal dow'r  'Ah me what boots it that I now display  'The fatal could that brooded o'er that day  'That daywhen hope had chas'd each ling'ring fear  'When all my fond expectancies drew near  'When love and fortune smil'djoy turn'd aside  'And left me plung'd in woe misfortune's bride  'To the swift progress of disease a prey  'On death's terrific couch RODOLPHYS lay  'As sorrowwounded o'er his form I bent  'His closing voice these accents feebly sent  "The Pow'r above whose will we must obey  "Who tears me now from thee and joy away  "Late saw me at the conscious altar bow  "And heard these lips pronounce the hallow'd vow  "  Beneath the banner of the Cross to stand  "  And scourge th' usurpers of the Holy Land  "This unaccomplish'd vow to thee I leave  "With stedfast ear my parting words receive  "In the small compass of an urn enshrin'd  "To some bold warrior be my heart consign'd  "To live with him when his intrepid hand  "Shall scourge th' usurpers of the Holy Land"  'He ceas'dhis fading eyes now roll'd in vain  'Now clos'dand never gaz'd on me again  It was not unusual during the long period of the Crusades for the knights to make this request upon their deathbeds Among other instances see particularly one mentioned by FROISSART in his first volume chapter where the king of Scotland entreats DOUGLAS to embalm his heart immediately after his decease in order to carry it with him to the holy war  'No bold advent'rous warbred youth I sought  'For love inspir'd me with a bolder thought  'I dropt the robe that deck'd the peaceful maid  'And in the warrior's garb of steel array'd  'Amidst the embattled ranks unknown I stood  'Beneath the banner of the holy rood  'As in their urn RODOLPHUS' ashes slept  'I bore them to the plain where RACHEL wept  'Peace to the souls of Archers that were hurl'd  'In that dread moment to another world  'Fierce from the hands of hostile Pagans flung  'Dark o'er the field a cloud of jav'lins hung  'Still to this mind returns dismiss'd in vain  'The thund'ring tumult of the horrid plain  'At length our daring men to valor true  'The fierytressed Saracens o'erthrew  'Still dost thou ask what charm what sacred pow'r  'Upheld my frame in danger's rudest hour  'Behold behold the wonderworking charm  Taking the urn from her garment    'That calm'd my fear in danger's rude alarm  'This little tomb that clasps his better part  'Where sleep the ashes of his spotless heart  'This relic as it touch'd my conscious breast  'My fainting soul with energy imprest  'Enoughsoon as the flag of truce unfurl'd  'Its softer color to the Pagan world  'To England then I urg'd my lonesome way  'Cloath'd in this pilgrim garb of amice grey  'Still as the tenor of my way I kept  'O'er thee oh Father fond remembrance wept  'Oft did I say while tears roll'd down my face  'And as I spoke I mov'd with quicker pace  'By Time's devasting hand despoil'd of friends  'Unspous'd undaughter'd my lov'd parent bends  'Like desolation all unfenc'd he shews  'Expos'd and naked to assailing woes  'I go I go his sorrows to assuage  'To smooth with filial hand the couch of age  'Ply duty's task whose labors never tire  'Invent young sports to chear his evening fire  'The joy I cannot feel to him impart  'And brighten with his smiles my drooping heart'  'Forbear forbear' th' enraptur'd Father cries  While tears of gladness glitter in his eyes  'Oh insupportable oh joyful hour  'That bursts upon me in a flood of pow'r'  He ceas'dand to the moatencircled dome  In triumph led the beauteous wand'rer home  Where at the castlegate expecting staid  A num'rous train to greet the welcome Maid  Meanwhile the jocund villagers convene  Where the wreath'd maypole crowns the festive green  The comely maids the gifted ribband wear  Gaystreaming from the flow'rencircled hair  See with the am'rous youths they now advance  Demand the music and provoke the dance  Link'd hand in hand they form the mirthful round  Obedient to the shrill pipe's nimble found  Thus on the flowing stream of time the day  With prosp'rous fails glides rapidly away  Till as the faint beams glimmer from the west  The curfew tolls the hamlet train to reft  A beautiful Picture taken from the Ancient Wake by HAMILTON is to be seen in MACKLIN'S Gallery  INSCRIPTION INTENDED FOR AN OLD THATCHED CHURCH  FAR from the splendor of a costly fane  My low roof canopies the humble train  Deep in my vaults divorc'd from human woes  The lifeworn weary villagers repose  When at my altar kneels the hamlet Fair  And to her God unveils her bosom'd care  Or does the herdsman bend with grief diftrest  Kind comfort steals upon their lighten'd breast  Here too Religion weaves with viewless hand  For spotless village hearts the nuptial band  And twines with many a charm the holy braid  That joins the lab'rer and the nutbrown maid  ON THE DEATH of TWO FAVOURITE BIRDS  INVOLV'D in flame and suffocating breath  A hapless bird was doom'd to sudden death  The female touch'd at his uncommon fate  Survey'd the form of her disfigur'd mate  With drooping head and shiv'ring wings she stood  In all the agony of widowhood  At length to grief's severest pow'r a prey  She droptand sigh'd her little soul away  Ye wedded birds tho' rigid be your doorn  Yet ANNA  The Honourable Mrs TALBOT  watches at your early tomb  For you her flowing pity

a friend's success  Thine the soft show'rs down Beauty's breast that steal  To sooth the heartwounds they can never heal  Thine too the tears of ecstacy that roll  When Genius rushes on the ravish'd soul  And thine the hallow'd flood that drowns the eye  When warm Religion lifts the thought on high  THE SOLDIER's FAREWELL ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE  NIGHT expecting the dread morrow  Hover'd o'er the martial train  Beauteous ALICE led by sorrow  Hurried to the silent plain  'Give the watchword' the guard utter'd  Loudly from his destin'd place  'Lo 'tis I' fair ALICE mutter'd  Hastening to his

art thou come  'Till morn wakes the battle's thunder  'Rest thee on that broken drum'  She sat down in mind reviewing  Ills the morning might behold  Tears still other tears pursuing  Down her cheek in silence roll'd  Thoughts to other thoughts succeeding  O'er her mind incessant flow  She like Meekness inlybleeding  Broods in stillness o'er her woe  'Wherefore ALICE dost thou ponder  'Evils that are Fancy's brood  'Sure our parting might be fonder  'Than beseems this silent mood  'Yet continue still to ponder  'Things thy voice wants pow'r to say  'Thy dumb grief to me seems fonder  'Than words deck'd in bright array'  She replied her tears still gushing  'What avails it to be brave  'Thou amidst the battle rushing  'Here perchance may'st meet a grave  'Should'st thou perish in the

fiction The young woman was cruelly deluded by a man who was already married The mock ceremonial of a marriage took place in ITALY She soon after returned to ENGLAND and going into a sequestered part

taste refin'd  And sentiment and knowledge meet  Love who oft whelms the Fair in woe  Soon robb'd her guileless mind of rest  Affection's flame dissolv'd the snow  That lodg'd within her spotless breast  As still the East the mornbeams streak  And gild the portal of the day  So did her morning thought still break  On the same Youth with Ardour's ray  As the last glimm'rings of the sky  Pause

laws  'Is deepen'd by the terrorbreathing pause  'While' midst encircling clouds of incense lost  'The trembling priest upholds the  sacred host  'Amid these scenes shall I forget my suit  'Amid these scenes shall I alone be mute  'Nor to the footsteps of the throne above  'Breathe the warm requiem to the Youth I love  'Now silence reigns along the gloomy fane  'And wraps in dread repose the pausing strain  'When next it bursts my humble voice I'll join  'Disclose my trembling wish at Mercy's shrine  'Unveil my anguish to the throne above  'And sigh the requiem to the Youth I love  'Does Fancy mock me with a false delight  'Or does some hallow'd vision cheer my sight  'Methinks emerging from the gloom below  'Th'immortal spirits leave the house of woe  'Inshrin'd in Glory's beams the reach the sky  'While choral songs of triumph burst from high  'See at the voice of my accorded pray'r  'The radiant Youth a  cen  the fields of air  'Beholdhe mounts unutterably bright  'Cloath'd in the sunrobe of unfading light  'Applauding Seraphs hail him on his way  'And lead him to the gates of everlasting day'  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
